	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) common , infectious , bacterial disease spread infect person transmits saliva air cough sneeze . Despite availability effectiveness affordable six-month treatment tuberculosis ( TB ) , worldwide control disease currently impact emergence multidrug resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) . MDR-TB refers TB resistant least isoniazid rifampicin . These two powerful first-line drug use treat pulmonary TB . MDR-TB usually develop person take TB treatment due either inappropriate treatment failure patient comply treatment . This strain drug-resistant bacteria also spread people air . MDR-TB lead considerable reduction effectiveness standard short-length treatment currently standard treatment MDR-TB last long 24 month . With incident rate MDR-TB rise ( 511,000 new case 2007 ) lengthy duration current treatment need investigate whether shorter-length treatment use effective drug global possibility . Three short course regimens drug evaluate alongside World Health Organisation recommend 24 month regimen treatment MDR-TB . A total least 1155 participant MDR-TB recruit follow total 132 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Evaluation Standard Treatment Regimen Anti-tuberculosis Drugs Patients With MDR-TB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The STREAM study international , multi-centre , parallel-group , open-label , randomise , control trial patient multi-drug resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) include patient rifampicin-resistant isoniazid-sensitive TB . Background Rationale : The current recommend treatment approach MDR-TB base largely expert opinion lack good evidence optimal management . The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) guideline treatment MDR-TB recommend intensive phase treatment base least four drug know effective give minimum 20 month . However , evaluation treatment success regimens 9 country vary 25 % 73 % . Van Deun et al ( 2010 ) report excellent long-term outcome cohort 200 patient Bangladesh MDR-TB treat regimen give nine month . Bedaquiline novel diarylquinoline antibiotic bactericidal activity . In phase II trial patient MDR-TB time culture conversion significantly less patient receive bedaquiline compare receive optimise background regimen ( Diacon et al ( 2012 ) . In December 2012 US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve bedaquiline part treatment regimen MDR-TB agent unavailable . Study treatments The treatment evaluate within STREAM trial stage 2 : Regimen A The locally-used World Health Organization ( WHO ) approve MDR-TB regimen . Regimen B Regimen B base regimen describe Van Deun et al ( 2010 ) report excellent long-term outcome cohort 200 patient Bangladesh MDR-TB treat regimen give nine month . In STREAM regimen B consist clofazimine , ethambutol , moxifloxacin , pyrazinamide give 40 week , supplement isoniazid , kanamycin , prothionamide first 16 week ( intensive phase ) . Regimen C Regimen C 40-week all-oral regimen consist bedaquiline , clofazimine , ethambutol , levofloxacin , pyrazinamide give 40 week supplement isoniazid prothionamide first 16 week ( intensive phase ) . Regimen D Regimen D 28-week regimen consist bedaquiline , clofazimine , levofloxacin , pyrazinamide give 28 week supplement isoniazid kanamycin first 8 week ( intensive phase ) . The primary objective STREAM2 trial : 1 . To assess whether proportion patient favourable efficacy outcome Regimen C , fully oral regimen , superior Regimen B , control regimen Stage 2 Week 76 2 . To assess whether proportion patient favourable efficacy outcome Regimen C , fully oral regimen , inferior Regimen B Week 76 , use 10 % margin non-inferiority 3 . To assess whether proportion patient favourable efficacy outcome Regimen D , shorten regimen , inferior Regimen B Week 76 , use 10 % margin non-inferiority . The first primary objective , assess superiority Regimen C Regimen B , requirement US FDA ; second third primary objective programmatic relevance . Study Population A total least 1155 participant multi-drug resistance tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) include patient rifampicin-resistant isoniazid-sensitive TB , recruit site number country . They randomise either Regimen A , Regimen B , Regimen C , Regimen D ratio 1:2:2:2 ( i.e . 165 allocated Regimen A , 330 allocate Regimen B , 330 allocate Regimen C , 330 allocate Regimen D ) . All patient follow Week 132 . The primary analysis base data accrue Week 76 base proportion patient favourable outcome time point ; data accrue Week 132 use secondary analysis . Although STREAM study open-label study , wherever possible conduct masked treatment allocation .</detailed_description>
