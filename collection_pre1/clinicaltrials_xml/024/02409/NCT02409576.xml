	<brief_summary>Progress treatment child leukemia lymphoma result high cure rate progress treatment child adolescent solid tumor slow . Despite aggressive therapy multimodality treatment involve surgery , radiation chemotherapy , two third patient metastatic Ewing sarcoma ( EWS ) , metastatic osteosarcoma ( OS ) intermediate high risk rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) relapse . The available second line therapy relapse limited often effective . There dire need look treatment option beyond conventional mean treatment patient . Infusions allogeneic natural killer ( NK ) cell leukemia patient show tolerated well without induce graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . There also mount evidence NK cell activity solid tumor . In lab investigator test NK cell activity cell line different paediatric solid tumor . Among paediatric solid tumor , EWS RMS exquisitely sensitive kill expand NK cell ; NK cell also activity OS cell . Preliminary clinical data suggest donor NK cell may exert antitumor activity child solid tumor undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Taking account safety adaptive NK cell infusion , efficacy EWS , RMS OS , NK cell could powerful new tool treatment paediatric solid tumor . The great anti-tumor activity expand activate NK cell , together feasibility infuse haploidentical NK cell non-transplant set form compel rationale clinical test NK cell patient sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Expanded , Activated Haploidentical Natural Killer Cell Infusions Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adoptive transfer allogeneic NK cell show safe patient leukemia . The patient enrol receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy cyclophosphamide ( 1 day ) follow fludarabine ( 5 day ) Each patient receive IL-2 alternate day start 1 day infusion NK cell total 6 dos . Patient undergo image MRI PET CT scan one month infusion ass response NK cell infusion . In study aim determine feasibility , safety efficacy expand , activate NK cell patient EWS , RMS OS . We also study persistence phenotype expand NK cell research participant EWS , RMS OS . The main hypothesis test study infusion expand , activate haploidentical NK cell produce measurable clinical response patient EWS , RMS OS .</detailed_description>
