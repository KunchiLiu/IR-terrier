	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety performance EktoTherix™ Tissue Repair Scaffold treatment full-thickness , dermatologic wound create surgical removal non-melanoma skin cancer . EktoTherix™ medical device develop Neotherix Limited , manufacture polymer processing technique electrospinning . Described `` tissue scaffold '' , EktoTherix place surgical wound help patient ' cell repair wound , enhance heal improve quality ( include cosmetic outcome ) . The tissue scaffold completely absorb body heal process , mean need remove wound heal . All patient recruit study treat EktoTherix , see weekly heal see final follow-up visit three month post-surgery . The investigator hypothesise use EktoTherix increase incidence complete heal result overall well cosmetic result heal wound .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Is patient least 18 year age Is patient male , pregnant lactate use contraception Has patient diagnose nonmelanoma skin cancer ( basal cell carcinoma BCC squamous cell carcinoma SCC ) choose therapeutic option surgical excision follow secondary intention healing Is excisional wound great 10mm x 10mm size less equal 35mm x 35mm attempt primary closure Does patient limit skin laxity would make primary closure surgical excision difficult Is patient able understand aim objectives trial willing consent Has patient diagnose transmittable viral disease ( HIV , Hepatitis B C ) Has patient diagnose , suspect metastatic disease Does patient history malignant melanoma concomitant disease likely impede wound healing Has patient diagnose preexist wound infection Is patient take medication know interfere skin graft ( i.e . warfarin anticoagulant , steroid , NSAIDs immunosuppressant ) Has excise wound entirely treat primary closure Does patient history significant cardiac , pulmonary , renal , hepatic , neurological and/ immune dysfunction may affect wound healing Does patient know allergy device material use trial Does patient know history poor compliance medical treatment Has patient participate trial previously heal withdrawn Is patient currently participate clinical trial</criteria>
