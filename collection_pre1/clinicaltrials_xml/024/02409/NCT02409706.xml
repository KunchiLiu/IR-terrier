	<detailed_description>Congenital heart disease ( CHD ) one common birth defect UK . Children CHD risk underfeeding undernutrition . This due increase nutritional requirement disease sometimes clinical management , often hinder delivery optimal nutrition.There yet study assess micronutrient body store child CHD whether micronutrient deficiency predict poor clinical outcome , post-operative complication , major cardiac operation . This study aim explore frequency , type association micronutrient deficiency child CHD use standard novel marker blood . The study also explore whether micronutrient deficiency increase risk complication heart surgery . This study identify nutrient deficiency need monitor clinical practice .</detailed_description>
