	<brief_summary>Room air insufflate colonoscopy completely suction , easily absorb remain bowel quite time , result prolonged bowel distension discomfort bloating . Sufferers often experience sensation fullness abdominal pressure , relieve expulsion residual gas , often accompany colic pain . This lengthy process , patient continue report pain long 24 hour procedure . Abdominal discomfort colonoscopy adverse event commonly report patient , definitely associated procedure . Published report show use carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) insufflation significantly decrease bloat pain 24 hour post-procedure . Preliminary result investigator ' previous study on-demand sedation colonoscopy diagnostic patient show , compare CO2 insufflation , water exchange group ( WE , infusion water distend lumen insertion ; suction infuse water , residual air pocket feces predominantly insertion ) achieve significantly low real-time insertion pain score . Moreover ( insertion-withdrawal method ) WE-CO2 low bloating score procedure discharge , comparable achieve CO2-CO2 . Compared WE-CO2 , use WE-air insufflation ( AI ) show significantly high bloating score procedure discharge ; compare CO2-CO2 difference significant discharge . The investigator decide conduct prospective randomize control trial compare WE-CO2 , WE-AI CO2-CO2 . The investigator test hypothesis patient examined combination WE-CO2 significantly low bloating score specific time point colonoscopy examine use WE-AI CO2-CO2 . The investigator also assess impact three method patient comfort activity post-procedure period .</brief_summary>
