	<brief_title>An SRT Model Early Access ASD Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although caregiver often become concerned child 17-19 month age , child typically receive diagnosis autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) 4Â½ year old , old Hispanic family . It well document early participation ASD-specialized intervention lead significant improvement skill behavior toddler ASD . However , despite availability publicly funded Part C early intervention ( EI ) service , long wait formal ASD diagnosis prevent toddler receive appropriately specialize intervention critical birth-to-three year . In addition , caregiver concerned ASD experience high level uncertainty stress wait period . This project implement evaluate innovative healthcare service delivery model design promote early access specialize intervention toddler ASD . The Screen-Refer-Treat ( SRT ) model provide coordinated cost-effective approach early identification intervention involve medical EI provider , represent practical sustainable strategy bridge gap ASD concern ASD intervention . The SRT model , build availability validate ASD screening tool low-cost behaviorally-based ASD intervention , implement four diverse community across Washington State evaluate change service delivery practice toddler Hispanic well Non-Hispanic background . The SRT model comprises three component : ( 1 ) universal ASD screen 16-20 month prompt referral EI program primary care physician ( PCPs ) ; ( 2 ) expedite ASD assessment within EI program ; ( 3 ) use inexpensive , evidence-based ASD-specialized intervention EI provider . An electronic version Modified Checklist Autism ( M-CHAT ) automate score incorporates relevant follow-up question provide PCP practice , distance coaching via telemedicine available EI provider support ASD assessment intervention activity . A stepped wedge cluster RCT design use evaluate implementation outcome SRT model . Data screening , referral , assessment , intervention practice collect 40 PCPs 80 EI provider across state prior follow SRT implementation identify practice change . In addition , separate sample caregiver toddler ASD concern ( n=245 ) recruit community SRT implementation follow prospectively measure difference change time caregiver wellbeing , parent efficacy , satisfaction healthcare system , toddler 's social-communicative behavior . We predict implementation SRT model associate high rate ASD screen PCPs , earlier referral EI program , early initiation ASD-specialized intervention , reduce time ASD concern diagnosis , improve caregiver child outcome .</detailed_description>
