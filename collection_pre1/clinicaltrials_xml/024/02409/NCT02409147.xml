	<brief_summary>This study explore feasibility initiate uterine transplant program UNMC . Using procedural template establish successful Swedish team , investigator identify emotionally socially stable female reproductive age intact ovary unable gestate child due congenital acquire uterine factor infertility ( UFI ) . Women 21 35 year age upon entry protocol , normal ovarian reserve otherwise healthy pregnancy . After careful screening , participant undergo egg harvest , in-vitro fertilization , embryo cryopreservation use standard method . Women successfully complete vitro fertilization cryopreservation least six embryos eligible receive implantation decease donor uterus . After period observation ensure normal menstrual cycling graft viability , embryo implantation undertaken . Gestations carefully monitor high-risk pregnancy specialist . Medical research intervention include uterine harvest decease donor , surgical implantation organ utilize standard transplant technique , careful post-transplant follow-up include immune suppression therapy tailor minimize fetal compromise , careful management pregnancy . After childbearing complete ( two gestation ) , donor uterus remove . In addition , open-ended interview write survey conduct elicit ethical psychosocial concern arise experience subject family , health care provider , wide community . The investigator intent monitor outcome lifelong transplant recipient live-born infant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Uterine transplantation develop surgical/medical procedure ameliorate condition absolute uterine factor infertility . As condition , congenital acquire state render fertile-age woman inability child via conventional birth . It estimate condition may affect near 1 500 woman . The alternative , namely gestational surrogacy adoption , fraught legal , ethical , religious issue . Significant research progress obtain Europe ( namely Sweden ) facilitate uterine transplantation . Recently , able obtain successful live childbirth use donate uterus living relative . Based significant background research already perform , aim research study expand upon gain successfully establish decease donor uterus transplantation program UNMC . Prior success Swedish team , two European/Asian medical research group attempt deceased donor uterus transplantation . The first result organ failure unclear pathology . The second successful transplant , fail yield childbirth due multiple miscarriage . In 2004 however , team Sahlgrenska Institute Gothenburg institute rigorous research undertake order study phenomenon obtain childbirth . Using established immunological knowledge , practical experience use animal model , investigator able course decade , start active transplant program . From medical/obstetrics gynecology standpoint , potential subject screen use rigorous physical psychosocial evaluation . This involved meeting multiple member research team , addition independent monitor familiar field risk benefit participation . To facilitate success , woman partner underwent investigation rule sterility factor could relate fertility . Next , egg harvest embryo transfer undertaken accord currently accept protocol . Of note , woman uterine agenesis type neo-vaginal recreation order facilitate IVF . Finally , donor recipient HLA match do use standard transplantation method order avoid unacceptable match . During surgery , donor underwent extensive procedure order successfully dissect artery venous supply organ . The vagina transect caudal fornix , thus allow donor specimen attach vascular pedicle . ( The process remove uterus live donor infinitely complex decease donor , hence initial plan UNMC focus organ derive latter . ) Once organ remove , flush preservation solution use standard transplantation protocol . The recipient surgery also perform standard fashion , donor iliac vessel anastomose recipient . The vaginal rim graft suture recipient 's vagina standard fashion . Routine intra-operative examination Doppler ( assess blood flow ) perform prior termination operation . Maintenance immunosuppression give recipient use standard accept protocol close monitor drug level . Serial Doppler US do hospitalization follow ass uterine viability . Clinical examination obstetrician perform pre-determined interval biopsy uterine tissue take assess organ viability rule rejection . Those patient rejection treat standard transplantation protocol increase steroid . Embryo transfer do approximately 1 year post transplant , order ensure continue viability normal menstruation organ . Post transfer , hormonal stimulation do use standard reproductive endocrinology protocol . Serial monitoring fetus do routine interval 9 month gestational period . Finally , caesarean section perform routine fashion time birth . Our group rationale UNMC continue build accepted protocol develop Swedish team apply decease donor . The investigator believe vast experience transplant obstetrics/gynecology combine reproductive endocrinology facilitates undergo excite new medical surgical therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For transplantation , criterion follow : 1 . Female reproductive age intact native ovary medical contraindication transplantation , include surgical procedure subsequent immunosuppression , medical contraindication reproduction gestation transplant uterus . Evaluation medical contraindication determine maternalfetal medicine specialist UNMC . 2 . Diagnosed either congenital acquire uterine factor infertility ( UFI ) counsel alternate option family build include gestational surrogacy and/or adoption provide access alternate service . Acquired circumstance may include nonfunctional uterus hysterectomy due benign disease ( uterine fibroid , Asherman 's syndrome , pelvic infection , postpartum hemorrhage ) gynecologic malignancy uterus cervix . Additionally , UFI may result congenital anomaly uterus uterine agenesis . 3 . If uterine removal uterine cervical cancer minimum 5 year recurrencefree time period require . 4 . If MRKH Syndrome ( MayerRokitanskyKusterHauser ) Mullerian agenesis present , patient negative evaluation relevant congenital abnormality ( pelvic kidney ) . Additionally , woman Mulllerian agenesis absence vagina must neovaginal creation surgery prior uterine transplant order allow embryo transplantation monitoring organ transplant . 5 . Ovaries intact adequate ovarian reserve determine accepted marker include antiMullerian hormone level ( AMH ) , astral follicle count and/or early follicular follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level . 6 . Desires biological child unable unwilling consider gestational surrogacy , / seek uterine transplantation mean experience gestation , understanding limitation provide uterine transplant respect . 7 . Meets psychological evaluation criterion , e.g. , stable , committed relationship individual support uterine transplant intend coparent ; emotionally mature good coping skill significantly adverse mental health history ; normal intellect allow careful analysis risk benefit ; evidence coercion ; significant evidence previous noncompliance medical care ; evidence frank unsuitability motherhood ( e.g. , previous conviction child abuse ) . 8 . Likely comply medical management , include antirejection immune suppression , frequent followup surgical team , timesensitive reproductive endocrinology management , highrisk pregnancy management , possible highrisk neonatal management . 9 . Likely able accommodate potential adverse outcome loss graft , inability conceive , loss pregnancy , adverse fetal neonatal outcome . 10 . Willing consider transplant hysterectomy termination pregnancy medically necessary . 11 . Willing undergo oocyte harvest invitro fertilization prior transplantation , least six viable embryo cryopreserved anticipation posttransplant implantation . 12 . Financially able cover anticipate expense assist reproductive service , either third party coverage personal asset . For transplantation : Exclusions include genetic male , woman meet inclusionary criterion . Residence great Omaha area implantation pregnancy period require timesensitive nature transplantation assist reproductive technology , well frequent medical monitoring require transplant subject .</criteria>
