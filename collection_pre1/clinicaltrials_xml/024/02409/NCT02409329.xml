	<brief_summary>Approximately one three person diabetes nonadherent medication . Nonadherence common among low income , racial/ethnic minority type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , strong , independent predictor poor glycemic control , hospitalize , pre-mature mortality , high healthcare cost . Theory-based adherence promotion intervention effective atheoretical , adhoc approach , need patient high risk nonadherence . A well-validated theoretical model , Information—Motivation—Behavioral Skills ( IMB ) model , inform effective medication adherence promotion intervention patient HIV hypertension , inform adherence intervention diabetes . Moreover , widely available technology , mobile phone , offer mean deliver adherence intervention broad range patient , include low income , racial/ethnic minority high risk nonadherence . The goal research use IMB model inform content functionality mobile phone-delivered medication adherence promotion intervention , ensure intervention content clearly communicate ( i.e. , use simplify text plain language ) , evaluate intervention effect adherence glycemic control among low-income adult T2DM receive primary care Federally Qualified Health Centers ( FQHCs ) . This interdisciplinary research greatly enhance understanding address social-cognitive barrier adherence among high-risk patient diabetes , leverage mobile device support high-risk patient population general ; good design intervention improve service low-income , diverse patient , well high-risk group . Knowledge gain form work may also inform intervention reduce disparity adherence , glycemic control , diabetes outcome .</brief_summary>
