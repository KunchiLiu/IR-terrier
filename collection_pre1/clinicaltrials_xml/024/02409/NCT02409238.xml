	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance Mild Cognitive Impairment ( IRMCI ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Introduction In trial , drug study Metformin . It insulin-sensitizing biguanide long use safely effective antidiabetic drug patient type II diabetes . Rationale Study Purpose Dementia clinical syndrome due multiple aetiology , Alzheimer disease ( AD ) Vascular Dementia ( VaD ) two common . Dementia represent advanced stage syndrome spectrum cognitive impairment , age-associated neurodegenerative condition include age relate cognitive disorder ( aka age-associated memory impairment subject memory impairment , i.e . memory loss without cognitive problem within normal limit give person 's age ) , Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) , clinical entity include memory cognitive impairment significant functional disability meet threshold criterion diagnosis dementia . Of note , MCI consider prodromal state dementia increase risk subsequently develop dementia . MCI classify two main category : ( 1 ) amnestic MCI ( 2 ) non-amnestic MCI . Each MCI subtype classify accord presumed aetiology : degenerative ; vascular ; psychiatric ; traumatic . 1 . Amnestic MCI ( aMCI , prominent memory impairment possibly mild degree impairment cognitive domain ) , 2 . Non-amnestic MCI ( non-aMCI , memory largely unaffected domain cognitive behavioural functioning impair ) . Currently available drug approve AD ( anticholinesterase Memantine ) limit efficacy alter pathophysiological basis disease disease progression . No drug currently approve regulatory authority specifically treatment MCI . Because treatment less effective disease far advanced , individual MCI early stage illness likely well candidate clinical trial . Neuropathology-based study `` clinically non-demented '' individual show high burden vascular AD type pathology . MCI may therefore pathologically-based preclinical early clinical phase dementia likely progress AD VaD , hence appropriate predementia syndrome therapeutic intervention . Vascular-related Risk Factors . Prior research date amply support hugely important role vascular-related risk factor aetiology AD VaD . Because vascular-related risk factor treatable , possible prevent , postpone mitigate VaD well AD ( extent due vascular contribution aetiology ) . The vascular related factor associate dementia cognitive decline include diabetes insulin resistance , high blood pressure ( BP ) hypertension , total cholesterol lipid parameter , body mass index ( BMI ) obesity , metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . MetS cluster cardiovascular risk factor related central obesity include impaired glucose metabolism , dyslipidaemia , high BP associate increase risk Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . MetS show associate increase risk predementia syndrome include age-related cognitive decline , MCI VaD , albeit mixed finding association AD . Insulin resistance widely consider play central role pathophysiological mechanism MetS . Hence , lifestyle therapeutic intervention target lower insulin resistance promise MCI treatment option aim slow cognitive decline prevent delay progression dementia due AD and/or VaD ) . The role insulin resistance MCI dementia Insulin insulin resistance play important role function central nervous system development age-related neurodegenerative disease , include glucose metabolism , vascular function , synaptic maintenance , beta-amyloid regulation , tau phosphorylation . Insulin transport across blood-brain barrier , brain insulin receptor selectively localize key brain region , hippocampus , entorhinal cortex , frontal cortex , play direct role modulating level important neurotransmitter , synaptic plasticity , learn memory . Insulin also show regulate metabolism beta-amyloid tau , building block amyloid plaque neurofibrillary tangle neuropathological hallmark AD . Peripheral hyperinsulinemia promotes oxidative stress , protein glycosylation cerebral ischemia impairs clearance amyloid beta brain competition insulin degrade enzyme ( IDE ) . Diabetic patient likely manifest impaired cognitive function , cognitive decline significantly high risk develop Alzheimer 's disease vascular dementia . Both hyperglycaemia insulin resistance ( IR ) also show population-based study associate poor cognitive function old person . Hippocampal volumes small diabetic patient increase insulin resistance normal healthy control . Several mechanism likely explain increase risk cognitive impairment T2D . Insulin resistance mention show play direct role cognitive impairment individual type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . Additionally , chronic hyperglycaemia show associate decreased cerebral blood flow , decrease glucose transport across blood brain barrier , reduce cerebral glucose metabolism microvascular change endothelial damage . Finally , metabolic vascular risk factor dyslipidaemia hypertension closely link IR T2D show predict cerebrovascular disease , cognitive decline dementia . Lowering Insulin Resistance Recent data support development therapeutic target insulin pathway particularly lower insulin resistance potential treatment AD . Insulin administration reduce neuronal accumulation beta-amyloid peptide synaptic bind toxic beta-amyloid derive diffusible ligand cell culture ; improve cognitive performance rodent reportedly patient early AD . Insulin-sensitizers like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPAR- gamma ) report improve insulin sensitivity , decrease inflammation inhibit A-beta-stimulated secretion pro-inflammatory product . Rosiglitazone thiazolidinedione stimulate PPAR-gamma show inhibit beta-amyloid production . This insulin sensitizer use oral drug ( Avandia ) effective treatment prevention diabetes . However , recent concern increase cardiovascular mortality restrict use diabetic patient . Initial report suggest Rosiglitazone promising drug treatment AD . Positive effect cognitive function report preclinical animal study handful preliminary clinical study . However , finding confirm subsequently Phase III trial patient mild moderate AD . A grow consensus treatment trial AD may conduct late disease process effective . Nevertheless abundance data strongly support central role underlie metabolic pathogenesis AD VaD . Agents modify insulin sensitivity remain therapeutic option highly worthy inquiry . As rosiglitazone substrate multidrug-resistant gene product permeability glycoprotein , may high penetration blood-brain barrier . Metformin , however , insulin-sensitizing biguanide long use safely effective antidiabetic drug patient T2D antidiabetic drug conclusively show prevent cardiovascular complication diabetes . It show metformin evidently cross blood-brain barrier , accumulate brain act directly central nervous system . A major mechanism metformin action activation AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , play key role cellular energy homeostasis , insulin signalling , metabolism glucose fat . The activation AMP-activated protein kinase anti-inflammatory action metformin show occur peripheral tissue also brain . There hitherto publish report effect metformin treatment cognitive outcome diabetic patient . Recently , investigator complete 4 year follow-up study old diabetic patient find long term metformin use â‰¥6 year prospectively associate low risk cognitive impairment . Metformin oral antidiabetic drug biguanide class . It first-line drug choice treatment type 2 diabetes , particular , overweight obese people . In trial , dosage schedule metformin 250 mg thrice day , ( up-titrated weekly start dose 250 mg day ) . Despite well-documented tolerability , propose weekly incremental dosage design reduce possible side-effects drug-naive diabetic subject take Metformin 1st time . Hypothesis The novel strategy lower insulin resistance dietary modification exercise combination commonly use safe anti-diabetic medication , metformin could help slow cognitive decline dementia . Study Population Chinese patient use propose clinical trial build upon also use patient on-going Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Studies ( SLAS ) Study , Chinese Patients use . 360 Chinese patient prediabetes diabetes MCI identify recruit community primary care clinic : 1 .
