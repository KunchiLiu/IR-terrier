	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause mortality , morbidity rise healthcare cost worldwide . In 'real-world ' practice , AF often diagnose late time stroke detection difficult AF may present without symptoms intermittent nature . Furthermore , utilization adequate oral anticoagulation therapy ( OAC ) stroke prevention suboptimal Hong Kong . The challenge identify AF prior occurrence stroke . The late European guideline recommend opportunistic screening people &gt; =65 year pulse palpation follow 12-lead ECG . However , 12-lead ECG require trained technician , time consuming , require patient lie examination couch readily available outpatient clinic Hong Kong . A practical screening test need . Our study aim evaluate feasibility , acceptability incremental cost outpatient base AFscreening program use AliveCor device . Newly diagnose AF patient randomize routine care versus individualize stroke prevention strategy consist patient education , stroke bleed risk assessment , evidence-based OAC recommendation , patient audit follow-up improve OAC utilization stroke prevention . We envisage study provide timely evidence inform policy decision concern population-based AF-screening AF stroke prevention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hong Kong Outpatient AF Screening Using Single-lead ECG Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design The study consist 2 stage . The screening study examine feasibility screen identify undiagnosed AF elderly ( &gt; =65 year ) use validate hand-held ECG device impact screen clinical economic outcome population level . Subsequent intervention study randomized-controlled study compare individualize stroke prevention strategy routine care prevent stroke screen-detected AF patient . Stage 1 : AF Screening Study Screening perform 2 Cardiology 4 Family Medicine Specialty Out-Patient Clinics ( SOPC ) tertiary referral hospital Hong Kong . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion sign inform consent Stage 1 2 study separately , prior conduct ECG screening . Stage 2 : Randomized Study Individualized Stroke Prevention v . Routine Care Intervention Screen detect AF patient ( new know AF ) Stage 1 already receive appropriate OAC stroke prevention sign informed consent randomize 1:1 routine care individualize stroke prevention strategy . Participants randomize use block randomization method assure group number subject . Individualized Stroke Prevention Strategy ( ) Patient education AF stroke risk . ( ii ) Assess individual risk stroke use CHADS2 CHA2DS2VASc score risk major bleed use HAS-BLED score ( iii ) Recommendation evidence-based stroke prevention therapy ( iv ) Patient audit follow-up : Patients appropriate OAC without adequate explanation refer Cardiology SOPC second opinion . Routine Care The iECG trace report provide attend doctor . Prescription OAC leave discretion attend doctor . Follow-up Participants follow prospectively every 12 month 3 year clinical event include death , ischemic stroke , thromboembolic event , intracranial major bleed stroke prevention therapy . Screen-detected AF patient Stage 1 decline participate intervention study follow registry .</detailed_description>
