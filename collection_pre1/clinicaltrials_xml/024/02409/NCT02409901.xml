	<detailed_description>The propose study , data collection , intervention perform Integrative Physiology Laboratory University Illinois Chicago . Blood sample collect Transplant Clinic University Illinois Chicago . The study use two-arm RCT design examine effect personalize exercise rehabilitation versus standard clinical care kidney transplant ( KT ) recipient . The primary outcome patient return work/find work rate . Secondary outcome include physical vascular function , body composition , perceive quality life , kidney function blood lipid marker , adherence . 120 kidney transplant recipient randomize 2:1 either exercise rehabilitation program control group , involve standard clinical care . Randomization do obtain informed consent baseline testing , utilize computerized randomization program way prevent potential selection bias . The exercise rehabilitation arm include low intensity , personalize resistance training two time per week 12 month period addition standard clinical care ( include regular check-ups blood work recommend post-transplant physician ) . The control group continue standard care advise post-transplant medical team additional intervention . The investigator collect data employment status , physiological psychological data baseline ( intervention ) , ( 6 month ) , immediately intervention ( 12 month ) . Adherence monitor throughout entirety study record study visit well exercise trainer keep record patient 's attendance exercise arm . A 2 X 3 ( condition X time ) mixed factor , analysis variance intent-to-treat principle utilized test effect intervention outcome variable . The investigator ' primary hypothesis 12 month exercise rehabilitation program increase return work/find work rate kidney transplant recipient . It additionally hypothesize 12 month exercise rehabilitation program prevent decline subclinical atherosclerosis , increase functional capacity , increase lean muscle mass . Outcome measure subclinical atherosclerosis include aortic pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ) , endothelial function carotid arterial stiffness . The outcome measure functional capacity include 6 minute walk test ( 6MW ) , unilateral isometric strength test , free-living accelerometry . Fat lean muscle mass assess via Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . Quality life perception pain assessed utilizing Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Global health PROMIS 29 v 2 questionnaire . Additionally , fast blood lipid profile , inflammatory marker , marker kidney function include glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) creatinine level measure .</detailed_description>
