	<brief_summary>The WHO , state age related cataract account 51 percent worldwide blindness affect 20 million people . Surgery intraocular lens ( IOL ) implantation first line treatment cataract , thus go effort improve IOL design performance . It plan compare three different IOL design psychophysical test setting . Most IOL test do 2D scenario Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity contrast sensitivity test . The use 3D scenario would allow test real-life situation . As various downside different IOL design report , test IOLs surgical implantation promise approach maximise patient satisfaction . Known deficiency include amongst others reduce contrast sensitivity light intensity . To test three different IOL design , plan 2D healthy young subject look stable , table mount spectacle frame , different IOLs insert . This allow subjective test IOL 's 2D 3D scenario .</brief_summary>
