Objectives : To investigate effect Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation inflammatory marker , sleep , pulmonary function , BMI reduction health relate quality life severe obese patient without metabolic syndrome undergone bariatric surgery . Methods/Design : Will participate severe obese patient without MS , screen Bariatric Surgery Service Santa Casa de Sao Paulo . The inclusion criterion patient morbid obesity grade III , indication bariatric surgery agree study , sign informed consent . Subjects BMI 55 kg / m² , clinically significant mental health concern unstable , unrealistic target postsurgical weight and/or unrealistic expectation surgical treatment exclude . Patients use NPPV pre post bariatric surgery . The evaluation protocol consist clinical history , vital sign , anthropometric data , clinical analysis blood adipose inflammatory marker , lung function test , polysomnography , sleep scale , cardiovascular risk quality life questionnaire . Patients evaluate bariatric surgery , 90 , 180 360 day .</detailed_description>
