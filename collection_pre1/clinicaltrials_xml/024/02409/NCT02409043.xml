	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine molecule blood indicate person stroke , type stroke , appropriate treatment may begin soon possible . This study also conduct determine whether molecule help predict long-term health follow stroke . Some potential molecule , also call biomarkers , include Neuronal biomarker ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 ( UCH-L1 ) , Glial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , neuroprotective enzyme call angiotensin convert enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , activity show helpful cardiovascular disease show alter animal model acute stroke , also show provide neuronal protection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Plan Participants recruit present Shands University Florida ( UF ) hospital emergency room within early hour symptom onset , time blood draw take . Either emergency room , intensive care unit , general hospital ward , member study team obtain informed consent study participation within 24 hour first blood draw . The study team provide participant legally authorize representative ( LAR ) consent form read explain study participant LAR use consent form guide . Time give allow participant LAR read consent form question answer . If participant LAR agree participate , study team member participant sign consent form copy sign form give participant ' record . Study procedure : Information collect medical record determine type severity stroke participant time stroke onset . Three 10cc sample blood draw 90 participant stroke ( 45 ischemic stroke 45 hemorrhagic stroke ) . Samples blood also draw 45 control 45 patient stroke mimic , clinical symptom could stroke determine due another cause ( e.g . transient ischemic attack ) . The first 10cc drawn within 18 hour stroke onset second drawn 72 hour follow stroke onset . The third obtained UF Neurology outpatient clinic 2-8 week stroke . The first blood sample draw initial evaluation ER prior obtain inform consent . This due hectic ER environment need participant LAR make serious medical decision initial evaluation ; factor make non-ideal time perform inform consent process . The blood sample store use de-identified participant number identification . Once participant 's condition stabilize serious medical decision make , study team member approach participant LAR inform consent process describe . If informed consent obtain within 24 hour obtain first blood sample participant enrol study , store blood sample keep processing , second third blood sample draw previously describe test aforementioned panel biomarkers perform blood sample . If participant LAR decline participate study informed consent obtain within 24 hour obtain first blood sample : 1 ) store blood sample use purpose , 2 ) store blood sample completely destroy within 24 hour knowledge participant participate study 3 ) blood sample obtain . Finally , participant 's asked complete brief ( le 5 minute ) phone survey 3 month stroke assess long-term stroke disability .</detailed_description>
