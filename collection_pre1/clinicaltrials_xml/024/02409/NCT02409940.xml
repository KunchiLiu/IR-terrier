	<brief_summary>Despite miracle modern medicine , solid organ transplant recipient always risk rejection , remain dependent lifelong immunosuppression . Currently use immunosuppressive drug suppress potential immune system interfere metabolism medication . Cellular therapy currently investigate purpose require use ablative radiotherapy . The investigator use less toxic strategy harness immunosuppressive potential MSCs Kidney Transplant ( KTx ) recipients study immunomodulation mediate cell KTx patient . Hypothesis MSCs interfere signal Immune cell like T cell , B cell Dendritic cell lead improve graft survival renal transplant patient . Aim To investigate effect MSCs immune cell repertoire donor specific mediate response . The investigator aim collect peripheral blood 30 patient ( 10 patient autologous cell infusion 10 allogeneic ( donor derive cell infusion ) various time interval follow MSC therapy . 10 patient serve control standard dose drug without MSC infusion . This peripheral blood would utilize isolation mononuclear cell perform various immune assay cell donor specific response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Elucidate Effect Mesenchymal Stem Cells T Cell Repertoire Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label type study 3 group patient : 1st group comprise patient would undergo allogeneic ( donor-derived ) mesenchymal stem cell infusion , 2nd group would undergo autologous ( patient-derived ) mesenchymal stem cell third group ( control group ) without stem cell infusion . All three group would standard dose Immunosuppressive drug . Initially investigator want recruit 10 patient group would increase group size investigator get promising result follow . The investigator plan follow patient upto 1-2 year immune base assay continue follow atleast 5 year .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All renal transplant recipient participate trial undergo primary kidney transplant . Donor living related patient . Kidney transplant recipient donor willing give inform consent form . There prior sensitization patient . Patients participate study Patients suffer autoimmune disorder .</criteria>
