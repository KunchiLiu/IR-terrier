	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Use Pre-emptive Pudendal Nerve Block Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects physical exam evolution pelvis support use POP-Q ( pelvic organ prolapse quantification ) system . All subject need sign inform consent pre-approved IRB . The subject , surgeon , anesthesiologist blind injected material . The OR Scrub nurse give envelope start case ask draw material syringe . All subject receive general anesthesia . Subjects randomize receive preemptive pudendal nerve blockade 10 ml 0 .5 % Bupivacaine epinephrine normal saline side . The allocation schedule computer generate use random-numbers table conceal opaque envelops . Once patient receives general anesthesia position appropriately dorsal lithotomy pad Allan stir ups . 10 ml Bupivacaine inject either side use Iowa trumpet pudendal needle drive direct guide appropriate position . Aspiration attempt every injection decrease chance intravascular infusion . At completion surgery subject bring PACU care . Patients assess immediately upon arrival PACU . The patient ask pain level use VAS pain scale/ modify surgical pain scale hour 1 2 post op . All patient give prescription Vicoprofen 7.5/200mg pre-op visit ask fill prior surgery . Patients option go home day surgery long pain well control clinically stable discharge . Continued pain management pain scale assessment do 4 hour , post op day 1 2 . A medication log keep 2 week post op , detail number pain medication take period .</detailed_description>
