	<brief_summary>Background &amp; Aims : The role red wine cardiovascular risk prevention document several epidemiological study patient normocholesterolemic healthy individual . However , unclear whether hypercholesterolemic individual free cardiovascular disease would equally benefit moderate red wine consumption prevent atherosclerosis development cardiovascular disease . Methods : Forty ( 40 ) healthy volunteer male female recruit , divide 2 age-adjusted group accord total cholesterol level ; asymptomatic hypercholesterolemics ( AHC ) , normocholesterolemics ( NC ) . Total Antioxidant Capacity ( TAC ) , Lipid profile , Vitamin E , cardiovascular risk index ( LDL /HDL Vitamin E/TC ) evaluate blood serum subject prior 1 month daily red wine consumption well prior give placebo drink follow 1 month wash period resveratrol 1 month wash period..</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design measurement This study cross-over field trial . Participants ask consume specific variety red wine `` tannat '' daily diet one month . After wash-out period one month , participant ask consume placebo drink daily another month . Quantitative measurement blood lipid , vitamin E , Total Antioxidant Capacity consumption wine placebo measure . The study aim investigate whether consumption red wine associate change level blood lipid , vitamin E , Total Antioxidant Capacity whether change - -equally occur hypercholesterolemic individual . Participants advise abstain consume antioxidant supplement , antioxidant-rich food ( include deep-colored fruit vegetable berry , tomato , carrot , broccoli , apple plum , green tea , caffeine chocolate ) , caffeine alcohol 2 week prior begin initial measurement 3-month experimental period . Participants ( occasional alcohol drinker ) include study receive monetary compensation . According U.S. Department Agriculture 2010 Dietary Guidelines , moderate drinking correspond one drink per day woman two men14 . Consequently , female subject give 5 bottle red wine 1 month ( 1 glass per day ) , male subject give 10 bottle ( 2 glasses/per day ) instruct report side effect failure participate . The single grape variety Tannat , location Northern Greece , select among several variety red wine content phenolic compound high antioxidant gradient test vitro . Participants encourage alter dietary habit physical activity level study . To verify compliance instruction provide , interviewed experiment , also measure quantity wine use . One day prior begin intervention , participant underwent physical routine biochemical examination complete two questionnaire , one relate health status characteristic . To confirm protocol adherence , team colleague contact participant telephone every 2nd day visit clinic obtain 1 bottle wine answer questionnaire regard adherence protocol requirement . For subject , measurement serum TAC vitamin E perform pre post 1 month red wine ingestion pre post placebo drink ingestion 1 month wash period . For vitamin E measurement , fast subject request abstain alcohol 24 hour prior blood draw . Serum level Total Cholesterol ( TC ) , triglyceride ( TG ) , HDL-cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol also measure enzymatic method . For serum HDL-cholesterol level , fast blood collect tubes clot activator determine enzymatically . For assessment cardiovascular risk , pre post red wine consumption ratio ( LDL/HDL-cholesterol vitamin E/TC ) calculate . TG/HDL-cholesterol , marker insulin resistance , also propose surrogate marker cardiovascular risk assessment . TC/HDL LDL/HDL also consider strong predictor degree clinical benefit lipid-lowering intervention .</detailed_description>
