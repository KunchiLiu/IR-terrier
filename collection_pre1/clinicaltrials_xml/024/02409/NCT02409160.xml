	<detailed_description>Obesity major public health problem develop develop country , cause range respiratory metabolic change . There strong correlation obesity cardiorespiratory sleep disorder . The weight loss reduces comorbidities improves quality life , clinical treatment effective long period . In context , currently bariatric surgery option real weight loss long term . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common clinical condition observe patient obesity . Recent study find 2/3 obese patient also OSA , exhibit similar pathophysiological substrate cardiovascular disease increase blood pressure common consequence . This raise another discussion obesity OSA may additive effect cardiovascular risk factor . Our main objective evaluate whether systemic adipose marker inflammation alters bariatric surgery biochemical index visceral ( omental , mesenteric ) subcutaneous adipose tissue depot fast blood sample , include proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , interleukin 8 ( IL-8 ) , interleukin 18 ( IL-18 ) , soluble TNF receptor-2 ( sTNFR2 ) , soluble E-selectin , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( sICAM-1 ) , soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( sVCAM-1 ) , monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP 1 ) , high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , adiponectin ( AdipoQ ) gene , vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) , nuclear factor Kappa B ( NF-kB ) adipose-derived hormone leptin . Moreover , identify possible association systemic adipose inflammation bariatric surgery magnitude surgery-induced weight loss ass pulmonary function spirometry , maximal ventilatory pressure vacuometry ; determine whether surgical procedure induce decrease body weight , BMI , abdominal circumference , improve quality life ; study sleep pattern full standard polysomnography quality life obese patient undergone bariatric surgery verify possible correlation weight loss physiological variable . Will participate study , patient severe obesity ( BMI &gt; 40 35 39.9 kg/m2 associate comorbidities ) , indication bariatric surgery , screen Bariatric Surgery Service Santa Casa de São Paulo São Paulo . Inclusion criterion severely obese , bariatric surgery indication agreement participate study . Are excluded patient BMI &gt; 55 kg/m2 , clinical instability , mental instability significant unrealistic expectation surgery . Patients assess bariatric surgery , 90 , 180 360 day . The evaluation protocol consist clinical history , vital sign , neck waist circumference , clinical analysis blood inflammatory marker , lung function test , maximal ventilatory pressure , full overnight standard polysomnography , excessive daytime sleepiness scale , cardiovascular risk , quality life personal satisfaction questionnaire .</detailed_description>
