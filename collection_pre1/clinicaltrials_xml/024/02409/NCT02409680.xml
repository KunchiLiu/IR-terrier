	<brief_title>Aspirin Supplementation Pregnancy Indicated Risk Reduction In Nulliparas ( ASPIRIN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Preterm birth ( PTB ) remain leading cause neonatal mortality long term disability throughout develop develop world . Though complex origin , grow body evidence suggest first trim administration low dose aspirin ( LDA ) hold promise reduce rate PTB substantially . Hypothesis : The investigator ' primary hypothesis nulliparous woman two previous first trimester pregnancy loss treat LDA daily begin 6 0/7 week 13 6/7 week gestational age ( GA ) 36 0/7 week GA reduce rate preterm birth cause . Study Design Type : Prospective randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded multicenter clinical trial ( patient level 1:1 ) . Population : Nulliparous woman age 18 ( local age majority ) 40 two previous first trimester pregnancy loss second trimester spontaneous pregnancy loss , singleton pregnancy 6 0/7 week 12 6/7 week GA confirm ultrasound , contraindication aspirin . Other medical condition , sickle-cell anemia , may consider contraindication per judgment site investigator . Intervention : Daily administration low dose ( 81 mg ) aspirin [ also know acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) ] , initiate 6 0/7 week 13 6/7 week GA continue 36 0/7 week GA compare identical appear placebo . Compliance outcome assess biweekly . Outcomes : The primary outcome determine whether daily LDA initiate 6 0/7 week 13 6/7 week continue 36 0/7 week reduce risk preterm birth ( birth prior 37 0/7 week pregnancy ) 20 % . This determine base assessed date delivery comparison project estimate date delivery , independent whether preterm delivery iatrogenic spontaneous . Secondary outcome include : - Preeclampsia eclampsia - Small gestational age - Perinatal mortality Other secondary outcome interest : Maternal outcome : - Vaginal bleeding - Antepartum hemorrhage - Postpartum hemorrhage - Maternal mortality - Late abortion - Change maternal hemoglobin Fetal outcomes : - Rate preterm birth &lt; 34 0/7 week pregnancy - Birth weight &lt; 2500g &lt; 1500g - Fetal loss - Spontaneous abortion - Stillbirth - Medical termination pregnancy</detailed_description>
