	<brief_title>An Intracavitary Electrocardiographic System Real-time Positioning Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Tip</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICCs ) increase significantly cancer patient receive chemotherapy . For patient , PICCs afford many advantage regard complication treatment convenience . Current practice utilizes estimate length catheter puncture site junction superior vena cava / right atrium ( SVC-RA ) guide tip placement . Next catheter tip placement confirm radiographic imaging prior use line administration chemotherapy medication . In case , catheter often mal-positioned require adjustment repeat radiographic image order ensure proper placement , ideally SVC-RA junction . These potentially additional procedure time-consuming also expose patient , nurse physicians radiation . Intracavitary electrocardiogram electrode place inside catheter insertion show identifiable change P-wave , sufficient guide PICC tip placement . Moreover , less procedural time radiation expect . This study aim demonstrate intracavitary electrocardiogram guide method superior conventional surface prediction length method term single-time target rate correct tip placement . In addition , would like investigate symptomatic thrombosis incidence risk factor three-valve PICC implant among patient malignant tumor ; clarify procedure time use cost new intracavitary ECG guide method explore maximal P-wave amplitude intracavity ECG real-time positioning technology predictive factor .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients malignant tumor require periodical infusion chemotherapy drug use threevalve PICC ; 2 . Aged &gt; 18 &lt; 80 year old ; 3 . Baseline ECG record prior PICC catheter show normal P wave ; 4 . Agreed participate study , sign PICC inform consent . 5 . Patients heart diseases , valvular heart disease , atrial fibrillation , supraventricular tachycardia , pulmonary heart disease pacemaker post cardiac surgery may affect P wave . 6 . Patients unable lie prostrate semisupine position .</criteria>
