	<brief_summary>The primary aim pilot study establish safety feasibility patient-controlled administration dexmedetomidine anxiolysis ( PCA-DEX ) burn care dress patient burn injury . The secondary aim determine acceptability PCA-DEX anxiety symptom management patient burn injury nursing staff care patient . Objectives Primary Aim # 1 Safety : To examine safety PCA-DEX determine proportion patient successfully complete pilot trial without adverse effect include significant hypotension , bradycardia , agitation uncontrolled anxiety . Primary Aim # 2 Feasibility : The primary objective study establish feasibility subject recruitment protocol adherence pilot study PCA-DEX patient burn injury require dressing change . Feasibility define follow criterion : ) number proportion patient consent enrollment , b ) proportion eligible subject enrol prior first dress change , c ) number day protocol patient successfully use PCS device , ) ability burn nurse adjust pump adhere infusion rate PCA-DEX protocol . Secondary Aim # 1 Patient Acceptability : A secondary objective pilot study patient evaluate PCA-DEX regard patient ' willingness use PCA-DEX prior burn dress change self-manage anxiety satisfaction rating anxiety self-management . Secondary Aim # 2 Nurse Acceptability : Another secondary aim pilot study evaluate nursing staff ' acceptability PCA-DEX protocol patient ' self-manage anxiety surround burn care dress change . Hypotheses # 1 : PCA-DEX protocol safe administer burn care dress change . # 2 : PCA-DEX feasible implement Burn Center OSUWMC . # 3 : Patients favorably appraise PCA-DEX self-control anxiety associate burn care dress change , satisfy PCA-DEX management anxiety . # 4 : Nursing Staff favorably appraise PCA-DEX perform burn care dress change .</brief_summary>
