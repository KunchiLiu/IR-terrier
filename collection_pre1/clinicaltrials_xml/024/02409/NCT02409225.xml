	<brief_summary>Purpose : Home monitoring ( HM ) service supply different manufacturer ( St Jude Medical , Biotronik , Medtronic ) enable trained medical staff ( doctor , electrophysiology nurse technician ) safely follow-up patient implant ICD/CRT-D remotely , omit unnecessary visit outpatient clinic , shorten time medical intervention therefore help decrease hospitalization rate among patient . The RESULT study primary endpoint trial composite all-cause death hospitalization due cardiovascular reason . The primary technical endpoint construct evaluate unify integrated platform data collect RM device manufacture different company : Carelink™ ( Medtronic® , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) , Merlin™ ( Saint Jude Medical® , St. Paul , MN , USA ) Home Monitoring™ ( Biotronik® , Berlin , Germany ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The RESULT trial prospective , single-center , randomize , open label , parallel study . All consecutive patient symptomatic HF reduce ejection fraction ( ≤ 35 % ) ICDs CRT-Ds implanted accordingly current ESC practice guideline prospectively randomize 1:1 fashion either traditional RM-based follow-up model . Six hundred patient enrol . The inclusion exclusion criterion show Table 1 . The clinical status patient estimate use composite endpoint all-cause death hospitalization due cardiovascular reason . The study protocol approve local ethic committee complies Declaration Helsinki . A write informed consent obtain study participant . Primary endpoint The primary endpoint trial composite all-cause death hospitalization due cardiovascular reason . Hospitalization cardiovascular reason consist : - Hospitalization due progression heart failure . - Hospitalization due persistent arrhythmia ( AF , VT ) . - Hospitalization due embolic episode . - Hospitalization due acute coronary syndrome . Every patient follow least 12 month randomization . Assessment hospitalization event cardiovascular reason perform accord recently publish consensus [ 13 ] . The final classification hospital admission due cardiovascular reason make blind endpoint committee . The primary technical endpoint construct evaluate unify integrated platform data collect RM device manufacture different company : Carelink™ ( Medtronic® , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) , Merlin™ ( Saint Jude Medical® , St. Paul , MN , USA ) Home Monitoring™ ( Biotronik® , Berlin , Germany ) . Secondary endpoint Both element combine primary endpoint analyze separately estimate relative impact primary endpoint . The secondary endpoint include follow : - All-cause death . - Hospitalization due cardiovascular reason . - Time medical intervention case relevant incident ( arrhythmic , device malfunction , sign HF decompensation ) . - Average number visit outpatient clinic ( schedule unscheduled ) per patient . - Time first unscheduled visit outpatient clinic . - Incidence inappropriate ICD shock . - Proportion visit outpatient clinic relevant finding ( necessity change device program pharmacological therapy , rehospitalization , intervention , invasive procedure ) . - Assessment quality life live study participant accord Minnesota Quality Life Questionnaire . - Cost-effectiveness , define cost hospitalization and/or schedule unscheduled visit group . All consecutive patient implantation ICD CRT-D manufacture St. Jude Medical , Biotronik Medtronic undergo initial evaluation . Patients give informed consent fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion screen . Randomization RM control group conduct within 30 day ICD CRT-D implantation final programming sense stimulation parameter . The time observation group 12 month randomization . In RM group , one follow-up visit plan 12 month enrol trial . In control group , follow-up visit plan 3 , 6 , 9 12 month enrol trial , accord normal procedure center . Unscheduled visit group initiate either patient supervising staff . The limit therapeutic intervention individualize depend clinical situation accord valid ESC guideline include follow : modification device setting , modification pharmacotherapy perform necessary invasive diagnostic therapeutic procedure .</detailed_description>
