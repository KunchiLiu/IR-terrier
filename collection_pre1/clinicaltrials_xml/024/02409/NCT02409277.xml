	<brief_summary>The investigator develop tool facilitate asthma self-management child , electronic-AsthmaTracker ( e-AT ) . The e-AT change ambulatory asthma care delivery new model continuous proactive , focus prevention control , rather reactive focus management asthma attack . The e-AT 1 ) engage parent weekly monitoring child 's chronic asthma symptom , 2 ) guide parent recognize warn sign asthma attack order prompt appropriate intervention timely visit Primary Care Providers , 3 ) provide Primary Care Providers real-time , objective patient data ass effectiveness asthma therapy prompt adjustment . In preliminary study paper-based version AT , frequent user significantly few emergency department ( ED ) hospital visit . Parent comment e-AT pilot test reveal tool useful help manage child 's asthma interested assess tool 's effectiveness identify address barrier sustain use e-AT . Improving asthma control child facilitate broad e-AT dissemination , identify address critical factor contribute parent sustain participation self-management . The investigator propose assess effectiveness new ambulatory care model support e-AT conduct e-AT process evaluation , assess barrier facilitator sustain parent use . The investigator engage parent throughout study identify address theme matter . The target population child persistent asthma , age 2-17 year . The investigator engage 10 parent since conception project , plan design validation paper-AT , design pilot test e-AT . Input parent receive 3 iterative focus group ( one paper-AT 2 e-AT ) facilitate discussion inform development proposal include research objectives outcome measure . In addition , investigator recruit key stakeholder result research relevant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Through follow specific aim , investigator : Aim 1 : Assess effectiveness new ambulatory care model , compare outcomes 1.a . child ( child 's quality life ( QOL ) , asthma control , missed school day ) , 1.b.parent ( satisfaction , parent miss work day ) 1.c . clinic ( ED/hospital visit ) level , clinic randomly assign either standard e-AT intervention vs. intensive e-AT intervention . 1.d . Use non randomized comparison determine effectiveness e-AT relative control group ( usual care ) e-AT use Aim 2 : Assess association QOL , asthma control , ED/hospital admission prior frequency e-AT use ass association differs parent subgroup ( high vs. low literacy , Medicaid vs. private insurance , frequent vs. less frequent e-AT user ) . Aim 3 : Determine association demographic , socio-economic , behavioral , technology factor sustain parent participation asthma self-management . The outcome measure : Primary Outcome : 1 . Child quality life ( QOL ) Secondary Outcomes : 2 . Child asthma control 3 . Child interrupted/missed school day 4 . Child use oral steroid ( surrogate measure asthma exacerbation ) 5 . Parent satisfaction care 6 . Parent interruption/missed work day 7 . Clinics : ED/Hospital admission</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Facility Eligibility Clinics eligible participation meet follow criterion : 1 . Primary care clinic clinical leadership adopt use eAT asthma management . 2 . Have patient 2 17 year age persistent asthma . 3 . Ability facility accommodate patient enrollment training use eAT . Patient Inclusion Criteria 1 . Children age 2 17 year parent ( main parent caregiver ) 2 . English speaker 3 . Children receive receive asthma treatment ( participate clinic ) . 4 . Parents Internet access 5 . Children persistent asthma . Patient As pragmatic trial assess evidence eAT real clinical environment , patient exclude long meet inclusion criterion . However , time analysis , conduct subanalysis , compare effectiveness new care model among patient without comorbid condition may affect measure asthma outcome . These include patient history increase risk pulmonary disease ( cystic fibrosis , broncopulmonary dysplasia , aspiration pneumonia , severe CP aspiration risk , technology dependency ( gastrostomy tube , tracheostomy ) , history congenital heart disease require surgical correction complicate congestive heart failure require medical management , immunodeficiency ( include patient immunosuppressant ) , malignancy .</criteria>
