	<brief_summary>The goal study investigate influence transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation 1. noradrenergic system brain 2. memory , healthy volunteer . Preclinical clinical study indicate noradrenaline play role work mechanism vagus nerve stimulation . This study investigate effect invasive vagus nerve stimulation replicate transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation . The release noradrenaline brain measure non-invasively P300 component event-related potential electro-encephalogram ( EEG ) via auditory oddball paradigm . Research elucidate work mechanism non-invasive neurostimulation help identify subpopulation respond well treatment provide insight could contribute optimalisation stimulation parameter , possible consequence well clinical outcome . Some study indicate stimulation vagus nerve optimally influence memory , possibly via noradrenergic system . This study investigate effect invasive vagus nerve stimulation memory replicate transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation . The influence transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation memory measure via neuropsychological memory task investigate ability focus attention . The correlation performance memory task signal analysis auditory oddball task could give indication underlie work mechanism transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation memory . This first step investigate whether transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation use innovative intervention cognitive decline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>First sympathetic skin response ( SSR ) measure investigate whether SSR could use method measure activity locus coeruleus non-invasively . There 3 condition : 1. transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation 2. sham stimulation 3. stimulation The condition randomize . In condition participant oddball task memory task . Between condition wash-out period 30 minute . After completion 3 condition wash-out period 30 minute , participant final recognition task ( part memory task total ) . During oddball task EEG measure . An electro-cardiogram ( ECG ) , electro-oculogram ( EOG ) larynx electromyogram ( EMG ) also record easy filtering artefact .</detailed_description>
