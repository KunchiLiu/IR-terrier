	<brief_summary>The purpose study gather information safe hyperthermia treatment deliver via Exatherm-TBH ( device heat blood deliver back ) , add best supportive care patient advance persistent recurrent , unresectable Non Small Cell Lung Cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perfusion-Induced Hyperthermia Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One potential candidate new approach advance lung cancer therapy hyperthermia lung cancer cell thermo-sensitive , significantly reduce heat shock protein ( HSP ) expression . Moreover , hyperthermia ( 42°C ) cause repression gene involve cell cycle cellular growth proliferation . Upon exposure hyperthermic condition , HSP expression increase normal cell . However , cancer cell expose hyperthermia , initially express significantly less HSPs normal cell , sensitize hyperthermia . Mild hyperthermia ( 43°C less two hour ) induces extensive double-stranded DNA fragmentation , late time , apoptosis murine thymocytes . In cell irreparable level DNA damage , apoptosis mean elimination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis Stage IIIB Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer receive least two line FDAapproved National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) accept systemic therapy progress , tolerate , therapy . Subjects whose tumor harbor exon 19 deletion exon 21L858R EGFR mutation must progress intolerance EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Subjects whose tumor harbor AKL translocation must progress intolerance crizotinib ( FDA approve ALK inhibitor ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 Life expectancy great 3 month . Age ≥18 year . There restriction number prior therapy allow disease prior radiation chemotherapy allow , provide subject recover grade 2 great toxicity prior enrollment . Patient understand nature procedure , willing comply associate followup evaluation , provide write informed consent prior procedure Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C , monoclonal antibody bevacizumab , cetuximab panitumumab ) prior enter study recover &lt; grade 2 adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients stroke TIA within 90 day prior enrollment ; peripheral vascular disease require intervention within 90 day prior enrollment ; know hemodynamically significant lesion embolic plaque . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL total Bilirubin , AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &gt; 60 defined Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) formula Thromboplastin Time ( PTT ) &lt; 35 sec ) Patients uncontrolled seizure disorder , spinal cord compression carcinomatous meningitis . Patients mental disorder , psychiatric illness/social concussion would inhibit ability provide inform consent prevent compliance followup . Patients high risk cardiovascular event severe uncontrolled hypertension ( &gt; 170/110 systemic blood pressure therapy ) , pulmonary hypertension ( great .5 systolic blood pressure ST elevation myocardial infarction within 30 day prior enrollment ; unstable angina significant , untreated arrhythmia within 30 day prior enrollment .

Patients major surgical procedure investigational agent within 30 day study enrollment . Patients know , untreated progressive brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Pregnant woman exclude study Prior malignancy except adequatelytreated basal cell ( squamous cell ) skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient diseasefree three year . Patients documented contraindication anticoagulation therapy heparin induce thrombocytopenia document coagulopathy hematologic disorder would contraindicate undergoing treatment use associate anticoagulant agent require treatment . Patients document active bacterial , viral fungal infection , untreated systematic peptic ulcer disease , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus serious concurrent medical disease could limit survival less 3 month . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential harm expose hyperthermia , well negative interaction medication hyperthermia .</criteria>
