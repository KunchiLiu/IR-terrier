	<brief_summary>Hematopoietic cell transplantation ( BMT ) , commonly refer blood marrow transplantation ( BMT ) , potentially life-saving therapy many malignant non-malignant condition . Despite advance past decade , lead improve outcome , BMT remain intense treatment modality often require prolong inpatient-based care . While many patient endure acute complication procedure , common BMT patient caregiver experience increase risk financial emotional burden , hospital readmission , health service utilization . This highlight importance active involvement BMT patient health care ( self-efficacy ) . For pediatric BMT patient , parent primary caregiver . As , parental activation behalf child ( patient ) play critical role effective patient-parent-provider partnership , increasingly recognize optimal model health care delivery , particularly face life-altering medical treatment . It essential develop effective strategy enhance partnership . Health information technology ( IT ) -mediated tool offer potential overcome constraint health care delivery limit provider time , complicate health information , financial pressure . Significant gap knowledge exist use health IT tool use low-cost well-accepted delivery platform routine inpatient care , especially high-risk critically ill population . The investigator hypothesize tablet-based tool display personal health information could provide platform promote caregiver ( parent ) activation enhance health communication . In clinical research study , investigator conduct pilot study educational health IT system develop tablet ( Apple iPad® ) investigator refer Personalized Engagement Tool ( PET ) `` BMT Roadmap . '' The Apple iPad® select platform delivery educational intervention give ergonomic feature . The implementation evaluation BMT Roadmap information system caregiver child undergo BMT base generation user ( caregiver patient ) need incorporate well-established user-centered design process include qualitative quantitative research method ( publish unpublished data ) . The assembled investigator represent strong multidisciplinary team complementary integrate expertise well-poised carry propose research . The Protocol Study Team include pediatric BMT physician , Center Health Communications Research ( CHCR ) staff , health informaticist , biostatistician , psychologist . This research study innovative address gap literature role health IT parent activation behalf child inpatient set high-risk BMT population . The BMT Roadmap information system provide robust experimental framework test utility care component relate parent activation participation potential adoption complex medical condition . The new knowledge gain herein thus contribute evidence base health IT improve health care quality provide basis study full-scale clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Novel Health Information Technology System ( BMT Roadmap ) Pediatric BMT Patients Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Title A Pilot Study Patient Caregiver Participation Educational Health Information Technology System ( `` The BMT Roadmap '' ) Context Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Objective To evaluate usefulness usability health information technology ( IT ) system ( `` The BMT Roadmap '' ) . This educational system develop Apple iPad® collaborator School Information , Health Informatics , Center Health Communications Research ( CHCR ) . The BMT Roadmap use caregiver patient hospitalize first-time autologous ( self ) allogeneic ( alternative donor ) blood marrow transplantation ( BMT ) well patient ( age 10 year old ) hospitalize first time autologous allogeneic BMT . The investigator hypothesize parent use BMT Roadmap become active participant behalf child . The information system consist 5 module personalize study participant 's child : ( 1 ) laboratory study , ( 2 ) medication , ( 3 ) clinical trial enrol , ( 4 ) health care provider ( BMT physician , 7 Mott Nurses , BMT NPs , coordinator , pharmacist , nutritionist , social worker ) , ( 5 ) criterion discharge . Sample Size Caregivers : The investigator aim enroll 10 adult caregiver patient ( 0-25 year age ) undergo autologous ( self ) allogeneic BMT ( alternative donor ) ; Patients : 10 patient ( 10 year age old ) undergo autologous allogeneic BMT . This sample size determine base patient demographic University Michigan Pediatric BMT Program . The number participant meet eligibility approximately 50 per year . The investigator plan enroll approximately 2 adult caregiver 2 patient per month estimate accrual time 5 month . This study allow concurrent enrollment trial . Study Design After sign informed consent , participant provide Apple iPad® . Qualitative quantitative research method use measure study outcomes . There approximately 6-8 qualitative interview per participant conduct periodically pre-BMT 100 day post-BMT . Additionally , 15-20 qualitative interview conduct BMT care provider , include physician , nurse , pharmacist , nutritionist , social worker , psychologist evaluate attitude perception BMT Roadmap information system . Quantitative survey instrument administer adult participant ( age 18 year old ) . Caregivers child ( patient ) young 10 year age may eligible participate even though child young assent participate . Inclusion Criteria Caregivers : Caregiver ( age 18 year old ) patient ( 0-25 year age ) inpatient undergo autologous allogeneic BMT ; Patients : patient ( 10 year old ) inpatient undergo autologous allogeneic BMT . Ability speak read proficiently English ( study 's instrument translate validated language English ) ; Willing able provide inform consent ; Willing comply study procedure report requirement . Treatment Plan This protocol educational intervention study ( minimal risk ) . It include treatment investigation agent treatment . Study Endpoints The primary outcome measure usefulness usability BMT Roadmap information system . Secondary measure include standard-of-care patient-related clinical outcome ( length stay risk day 30 100 readmission , infection , transplant-related mortality , survival ) . Data Analysis Descriptive statistic calculate survey instrument . Univariate analyse perform assess association instrument demographic , social , environmental characteristic parent ( type insurance , marital status , number child household ) , disease-related characteristic patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Participants recruit BMT RN Coordinators physicians prior patient admission Pediatric BMT Unit . Caregiver ( age 18 year old ) patient eligible undergo autologous allogeneic BMT patient ( age 10 year old ) eligible undergo autologous allogeneic BMT recruit `` PreTransplant Workup '' stage outpatient setting . CAREGIVER PARTICIPANTS : Caregiver ( age 18 year old ) patient hospitalize undergo firsttime autologous ( self ) allogeneic ( alternative donor ) BMT University Michigan Mott Children 's Hospital Pediatric BMT Unit . The age range patient typically transplant Pediatric BMT unit 025 year . Caregivers child ( patient ) young 10 year age may eligible participate even though child young assent participate . PATIENT PARTICIPANTS : Patient ( age 10 year old ) hospitalize undergo firsttime autologous allogeneic BMT give opportunity assent/consent participate study . With his/her permission , patient also provide iPad® BMT Roadmap information system use . Qualitative interview conduct patient ( age 10 year old ) assent/consent . However , patient ( age 1017.9 year ) ask complete survey , validated age group . Patients ( 18 year old ) ask complete survey . The upper age limit typically 25 year Pediatric BMT Unit . This limit determine patient undergo transplant Pediatric BMT Unit . Ability speak read proficiently English ( study 's instrument translate validated language English ) Willing able provide inform consent Willing comply study procedure report requirement . Not willing able provide inform consent . Not willing comply study procedure report requirement .</criteria>
