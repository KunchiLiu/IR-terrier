	<brief_summary>Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) common cause much pain disability . It cost NHS billion pound treatment every year second lead cause time work . There various treatment CLBP , effective still moderately helpful . Most people CLBP receive physiotherapy , vary result . Cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) may offer long term help current treatment enable people self-manage condition . A new type CBT , call Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) , produce particularly good result chronic pain . However , shortage clinical psychologist mean patient never receive CBT . Physiotherapists successfully use CBT technique extra training , standard practice ACT-based physiotherapy treatment never test . The investigator develop short ACT-based treatment ( PACT ) physiotherapists deliver aim compare usual physiotherapy care . The investigator recruit 240 people CLBP three hospital South East London . They randomly divide two group , half receive PACT half ordinary physiotherapy . PACT consist two hour long session one follow-up phone call , mean few hospital visit patient time session individualise treatment . It aim encourage people focus less get rid pain move forward important life . The investigator compare PACT usual physiotherapy see successful improve people 's ability function quality life approach help manage back pain best long term .

	<brief_title>A Trial Brief Physiotherapy Informed Acceptance Commitment Therapy Chronic Low Back Pain : PACT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Back pain cause considerable suffer major financial burden , cost NHS estimate £1.1 billion annually ( Maniadakis Gray 2000 ) represent second large cause absence work ( Young Bhaumik , 2011 ) . Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) , define pain last 12 week , responsible 80 % cost ( Department Health , 2009 ) . Physiotherapy common treatment CLBP , 1.26 million patient referred NHS physiotherapists cost £150 million per annum ( Maniadakis Gray , 2000 ) . Several form physiotherapy recommend CLBP , include exercise , manual therapy back class ( NICE , 2009 ) . The type physiotherapy vary considerably duration content , despite evidence different treatment similar effect ( Critchley et al , 2007 ) . Most trial show clear superiority treatment , majority lead moderate improvement ( Artus et al 2010 ) . A key focus treatment help people persistent CLBP self-manage condition thus improve pain , disability distress ensure episode low back pain result long-term withdrawal normal activity , include sickness absence pay employment . Cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) good evidence base treatment chronic pain ( Eccleston et al , 2009 ; Hoffman et al , 2007 ; Scascighini et al , 2008 ) Chartered Society Physiotherapy recognise CBT fall within physiotherapist 's scope practice ( Donaghy et al 2008 ) . However , CBT-based treatment deliver physiotherapist produce modest improvement CLBP ( Lamb et al. , 2010 ) remain unclear best implement cognitive behavioural approach physiotherapy intervention . One promise theory-based approach chronic pain form CBT call Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) ( Hayes et al. , 1999 ) . The primary focus ACT enhance psychological flexibility reduce struggle pain . This involve help people accept pain related feeling , become aware less dominated thought belief pain , identify follow direction life reflect value ( Vowles et al , 2011 ) . A meta-analysis ACT chronic pain show improvement depression , anxiety , pain intensity , physical functioning quality life ( Veehof et al , 2011 ) . It good maintenance treatment effect three year post treatment ( Vowles et al 2011 ) , important chronic relapse remit condition like CLBP . This suggest ACT-based intervention could well suit patient CLBP . In published study date , ACT deliver psychologist within multidisciplinary team limit availability clinical psychologist CLBP patient refer secondary care see physiotherapist psychologist ( Maniadakis Gray , 2000 ) . This study aim evaluate efficacy novel physiotherapy intervention incorporate new promise form CBT , Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) usual physiotherapy care . The investigator believe optimise outcome patient , NHS society large . The investigator conduct proof concept feasibility study develop brief physiotherapist-delivered ACT-based intervention , 'PACT ' , consist two one hour session plus follow-up phone call . The aim test PACT usual physiotherapy care phase 2 trial . The main research question whether PACT ( physiotherapist deliver ACT-based treatment ) effective . The investigator hypothesise group receive PACT improve function 3 month compare treatment usual group , maintain 12 month . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy PACT , novel brief ACT-based physiotherapy intervention chronic low back pain , primary end point function 3 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
