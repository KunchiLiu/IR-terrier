	<detailed_description>Pregnant woman present Labor Delivery identify potential participant base Inclusion/Exclusion criterion need receive Ampicillin and/or Gentamicin therapy . The additional group 20 non-pregnant woman also identify base Inclusion/Exclusion criterion need receive Ampicillin and/or Gentamicin therapy . Once identify , interested candidate fully inform study procedure , question answer , informed consent obtain . Pregnant participant receive Ampicillin 2g IV load dose follow 1g IV every 4 hr delivery ; Ampicillin 2g IV every 6hrs along Gentamicin 5mg/kg IV every 24 hr . Dose time record . Non-pregnant participant receive similar dos either Ampicillin and/or Gentamicin , dose ( ) . Fingerstick blood collection drawn population follow timepoints : - administration Ampicillin , and/or - administration Gentamicin - full initial dose antibiotic infuse , 5 min , 15 min , 30 min , 2-3hr , 4-6hr , immediately prior next dose drug , DELIVERY ( 5 minute window timepoint permit ) If delivery occur prior 3 6 hr timepoints , fingerstick blood collection continue Samples obtain filter paper via Dry Blood Spot ( DBS ) method , clinically appropriate purpose study . Umbilical venous arterial blood also draw sample placenta delivery , cut umbilical cord .</detailed_description>
