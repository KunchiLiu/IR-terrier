	<detailed_description>Claustrophobia disruptive patient motion common impediment MRI examination , may prevent ameliorate non-pharmacologic behavioral intervention administer trained staff . The potential benefit intervention highly significant , consider alternative cancel study administer sedation . Inability complete MRI scan adversely affect estimate 700,000 patient every year US . These patient either deprived diagnosis , subject diagnostic delay interpretation error due motion artifact , expose risk pharmacologic sedation , include death . The imaging facility typically fill suddenly vacate examination slot time next scheduled patient incur considerable lose revenue efficiency . A negative patient experience jeopardize Value-Based reimbursement Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) towards patient satisfaction count 30 % . The long term goal provide validate , clinically feasible mean non-pharmacologic amelioration claustrophobia disruptive patient motion , achieve training facility staff Comfort Talk速 . Comfort Talk速 training consist proprietary , standardized R3 Process Rapport , Relaxation , Reframing include 2 x 8-hrs class-room interaction , onsite coaching , institution-specific web-based support help MRI team develop language style skill set . The effect Comfort Talk速 training quantify prospective randomize design 12 MRI satellite Ohio State University Medical Center Duke University Medical Center .
