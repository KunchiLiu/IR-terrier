	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation gemcitabine hydrochloride follow radiation therapy surgery work treat patient pancreatic cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , gemcitabine hydrochloride , radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine R0 ( complete resection ) resection rate subject borderline resectable lymph node positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma treat multimodality neoadjuvant therapy preoperative gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) ABRAXANE ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) follow 5-fluorouracil ( fluorouracil ) base image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IG-IMRT ) chemoradiotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 1-year relapse-free survival rate investigational protocol . II . To determine 1-year 2-year overall survival rate . III . To assess response rate imaging ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 ) pathologic analysis . IV . To assess toxicity safety accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) criterion . V. To assess molecular predictor response survival ( serum cancer antigen ( CA ) 19-9 secreted protein acidic rich cysteine ( SPARC ) expression ) . OUTLINE : PRE-OPERATIVE ( NEOADJUVANT ) CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3-6 week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo IG-IMRT 5 day week 28 fraction receive fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-7 6 week . SURGICAL RESECTION : Patients undergo surgery 4-10 week last dose chemoradiation . POST-OPERATIVE ( ADUJUVANT ) CHEMOTHERAPY : Beginning within 8-12 week surgery , patient receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 additional course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 3 year every 24 week 2 year .</detailed_description>
