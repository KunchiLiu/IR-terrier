	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial study best dose safety Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 combination obinutuzumab ibrutinib see well work treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia return ( relapse ) , respond treatment ( refractory ) , previously untreated . Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , obinutuzumab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Giving Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 together obinutuzumab ibrutinib may better treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bcl-2 Inhibitor GDC-0199 Combination With Obinutuzumab Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed , Refractory , Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify dose venetoclax ( Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 ) safely administer combination obinutuzumab ibrutinib treatment relapsed/refractory previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . II . To evaluate feasibility , safety , tolerability venetoclax combination obinutuzumab ibrutinib patient relapsed/refractory previously untreated CLL . III . To determine minimal residual disease ( MRD ) -negative complete response ( CR ) rate 12 cycle treatment venetoclax combination obinutuzumab ibrutinib patient relapsed/refractory previously untreated CLL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) complete response rate ( CR ) venetoclax combination obinutuzumab ibrutinib patient relapsed/refractory previously untreated patient CLL . II . To estimate progression free survival ( PFS ) treatment venetoclax combination obinutuzumab ibrutinib patient relapsed/refractory previously untreated patient CLL . III . To conduct pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study venetoclax combination obinutuzumab ibrutinib patient relapsed/refractory previously untreated patient CLL . IV . To examine pre-treatment serial biomarkers associate response mechanism resistance venetoclax , obinutuzumab ibrutinib give combination relapsed/refractory previously untreated patient CLL . OUTLINE : This phase Ib , dose-escalation study Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 follow phase II study . Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 ( day 1 , 2 , 8 , 15 course 1 ) every 28 day 8 course . Beginning course 2 , patient receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Beginning course 3 , patient receive Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 PO QD day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 14 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 8 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
