	<brief_summary>Obesity consider cause imbalance energy expenditure energy intake . A major determinant daily energy intake size meal consume . It suggest decision portion size often make advance , meal begin . This pre-meal planning consider especially depend estimate 'expected satiety ' 'expected satiation ' different food . Further , also factor like weight concern palatability food might influence meal size selection . In general , clear factor integrate pre-meal planning brain network involve decisions/this process . Thus , investigator plan study pre-meal planning healthy , normal-weight overweight/obese individual functional magnetic resonance image different cognitive instruction include pleasure , expect satiety self-control term health consequence . The investigator explore neural network involve pre-meal planning expect modulate mentioned factor . Further , investigator plan explore gender difference expect female subject select small portion size especially self-control condition often concerned weight/health . Finally , investigator explore difference lean overweight subject elucidate factor might lead increased meal size overweight subject .</brief_summary>
