	<brief_summary>In resource limited setting , access one-on-one nursing care airway protection intubation may unavailable . Patients coma adequate oxygenation frequently care medical ward , nurse family member . The investigator previously audit use recovery position patient cerebral malaria find usage greatly increased educational intervention aim patient 's caregiver . A trend reduction coma duration aspiration pneumonia also find . Since evidence place comatose , non-intubated patient recovery position improve outcome , investigator plan conduct randomise control study compare standard care educational intervention target patient ' relative , teach maintain relative one two different recovery position . With preliminary efficacy safety data feedback study provide , investigator would move conduct large multicenter study power detect difference mortality .</brief_summary>

For patient intervention arm , patient ' relative instruct maintain patient recovery position , educational poster attach bed . Enrolled subject observe 3 time day discharge body position vital sign include GCS , heart rate , respiratory rate oxygen saturation . The primary outcome risk ( hazard ratio ) aspiration pneumonia pneumonitis . The secondary outcome measure include time hypoxia , death coma recovery time . Pulmonary complication define clinically radiologically . The primary comparison group standard care group versus recovery position combine . Analysis intention treat .</detailed_description>
