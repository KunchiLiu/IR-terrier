	<brief_title>Outcomes Liver Disease Patient With Without HIV Co-infection-Sub Study 2 : HCV Treatment : Health Related Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study collect information patient report outcome , , treatment hepatitis C virus infection , determine impact treatment liver function stiffness ( indicator inflammation fibrosis ) , determine cost treatment . The main question address ( 1 ) patient report outcomes change treatment HCV , ( 2 ) treatment impact liver function liver status , ( 3 ) much treatment cost payer 's perspective patient 's perspective . The hypothesis test treatment negative effect quality life treatment . The negative effect expect temporary . Successful treatment , equate virological cure infection , expect result improvement quality life compare baseline improvement marker liver function liver status . Costs treatment expect $ 80,000- $ 200,000 per virological cure . The purpose study give patient provider information expect undergo treatment HCV provide information future cost-effectiveness study . Previous study liver biopsy transient elastography demonstrate liver scar regress significant percentage patient achieve SVR ; however , majority patient liver cirrhosis time achieve SVR continue portal hepatitis high level alpha smooth muscle actin ( D'Ambrosio R , et al. , Hepatology , 2012 ) . Particularly interferon know cause autoimmune disease , possible residual liver abnormality due interferon exposure . If case , liver abnormality may regress rapidly completely patient receive interferon-free regimen . Currently , real-world data impact new regimen liver status measure transient elastography . This project fill important gap provide information change liver stiffness patient receive new therapy HCV .</detailed_description>
