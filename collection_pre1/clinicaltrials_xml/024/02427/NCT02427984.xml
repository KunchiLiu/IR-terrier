	<detailed_description>Every single year approximately 60.000 hip prosthesis implant Italy . Quality life patient surgery good , widely demonstrate clinical experience literature . On basis data produce complete hip register Italy , run Lab ( RIPO , Register Orthopedic Implants Region Emilia-Romagna http : //ripo.cineca.it ) survival rate primary total hip prosthesis 95.6 % 9 year . Reasons revision mainly aseptic loosen one component ( 40 % total ) dislocation ( 26 % ) , latter much frequent first two year . Less frequently revision due sepsis ( 7 % total ) , bone fracture ( 11 % ) , prosthesis fracture ( 3 % ) pain ( 3 % ) . Revision related , among others , prosthesis-linked factor , fixation bone articular coupling . In experience RIPO , last ten year 32 % implant articular component ceramic , 34 % metal head plastic liner , 24 % ceramic head plastic liner , 10 % component metal . Each solution strength weakness identify clinically apply order overcome step step limitation observe previous one . Alumina ceramic-on-ceramic ( COC ) bearing show produce substantially less wear debris traditional metal/ceramic polyethylene bearing . In addition , alumina ceramic material essentially bioinert bulk particulate form . Unlike metal-on-metal bearing ( MOM ) , bear couple release metal ion body either articulation breakdown wear debris . Weakness ceramic-on-ceramic bearing represent brittleness material . Ceramic fracture , even case , due trauma malpositioning . Beside occurrence noise gait patient extremely disturb patient , lead request revision . These two solution represent recent proposal technology suggest overcome problem wear . Hard component plastic unsolved problem wear debris , lead osteolysis consequent failure im plant . The problem partially solve introduction cross link polyethylene , aim improve tribological behaviour plastic . Rizzoli Institute public mono-specialistic research hospital Italy . Nearly 500 hip prosthesis revision perform every year structure . Due high specialization difficult case country treat , ly anatomy patient damage ( dislocation hip , post traumatic arthritis ) .even frequently failure implant occur . Aim research proposal investigate two uncommon less investigated early symptom failure : - 'noising hip ' ceramic ceramic total hip arthroplasty - pain metal metal total hip arthroplasty Even numerically important , two situation extremely relevant , prelude failure prosthesis . If clearly identify could represent powerful tool early diagnosis pending failure . The first point study CT scan patient evaluate impingement instability prosthesis , needle aspiration synovial fluid . The fluid examine identify ceramic wear debris , accord method separation analysis scan electron microscopy set Lab . Sound record mean wearable sensor set capable record articular noise produce level walk . This instrumentation couple motion analysis technology , provide temporal correlation record noise gait cycle . It develop first phase project . In parallel surface analysis conduct retrieval store Lab since 2000 , one big retrieval study ever conduct country . Type damage , surface roughness ceramic component analyse compare clinical data . Finally study complete vitro , use hip simulator , reproduce possible clinical scenario lead hip noise , record , analyse reproducible robust manner . This would make possible diagnostic approach able correlate involve factor clinical occurrence , basis record frequency . Second point study dosage circulate ion , derive articular surface histological classification vasculitis periimplant tissue . There increase evidence , indeed locale release submicron particle wear articular surface release metal ion ( mainly Chromium Cobalt ) responsible lymphocyte local infiltration . In particular cluster differentiation antigen 20 ( CD20 ) positive B lymphocyte cluster differentiation 3 ( CD3 ) positive T lymphocyte sometimes cluster differentiation antigen 68 ( CD68 ) positive plasma cell present . The cell could indicate specific phlogistic condition responsible pain eventually subsequent revision . Data collect studied population allow good understand two phenomenon possibly suggest new therapeutic approach problem .</detailed_description>
