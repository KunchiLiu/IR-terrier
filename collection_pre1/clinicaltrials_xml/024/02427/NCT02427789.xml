	<brief_summary>Depression disorder cause major harm physical health social life . It induce isolation , reduce physical work capacity increase risk death . In contrast , exercise help maintain quality life , also induce improvement cognitive function , stimulation brain plasticity resilience , addition promote self-esteem social interaction . The precise mechanism exercise improve symptom depression fully clear , probably multifactorial . In project , investigator aim investigate variable provide additional information biomarkers involve pathophysiology depression therapeutic response exercise . The investigator expect find changes biomarkers associate potential mechanism neuroprotection ( cytokine , marker oxidative stress , Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , cortisol ) exercise program role therapeutic depression . To evaluate functional assessment index use ergospirometry , test determines respiratory , cardiovascular metabolic activity . Overall , project help investigate alternative adjunctive treatment depression associate biomarkers response .</brief_summary>
