	<brief_summary>Aim 1 : To develop prospective tissue blood biorepository patient history Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE ) esophageal cancer ( ECA ) present UNC hospital routine care upper endoscopy condition . Aim 2 : To collect clinical data patient history Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE ) esophageal cancer ( ECA ) include demographic data , endoscopic procedure data , pathology data . Aim 3 : To integrate Aim 1 2 manner provide efficient bi-directional flow clinical information specimens laboratory clinical scientist order foster innovative translational research . Aim 4 : To create biorepository future IRB approve study tissue and/or blood specimen component .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients identify GI clinic visit procedure visit Dr. Nicholas Shaheen colleague UNC . Patients may also identify research personnel review endoscopy schedule medical record . If eligible , interested participant provide consent form clinic procedure visit . Enrolled subject assign unique ID number data collection . Patients recruit Dr. Nicholas Shaheen colleague study personnel prior routine care endoscopy UNC . An investigator , study coordinator , personnel train protocol reference IRB application obtain consent patient 's visit GI clinic prior upper endoscopy . Potential subject opportunity carefully review consent form , detail study review verbally , question answer satisfaction patient . Only English-speaking adult ability consent eligible enrollment study . After subject sign consent , copy sign consent provide subject coordinator collect demographic historical information patient pertaining illness , medication relevant information . The consent process document subject 's research file . After obtain informed consent , blood obtain subject proceed routine care upper endoscopy . The endoscopist , per routine practice , note finding procedure report photograph record video confirm document key finding , well take biopsy indicate routine care . During procedure 10 research biopsy collect part study . Research biopsy collect addition routine care biopsy obtain standardized biopsy protocol ( ) . The total number research biopsy may vary base presence/absence nodularity exceed 10 research-specific biopsy . This number esophageal biopsy within standard care biopsying esophagus . Biopsies clinical care take prior consideration research biopsy . Research biopsies take additional biopsy significantly increase patient 's risk interfere routine care procedure . The research biopsy protocol may modify physician performing procedure necessary . In addition research blood biopsy , 4 cytology brushing research purpose may also obtain procedure . Specimens collect research study include : - 1 10mL red tube 1 8.5mL yellow tube serum , plasma , buffy collection - Up 10 research-specific biopsy obtain esophagus routine care esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) . - Four biopsy take midpoint current Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE ) ( midpoint previous Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE ) patient already receive ablation previous Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE ) ) , - Two biopsy normal squamous epithelium , - One biopsy area esophageal nodularity see procedure - Pathology slide routine care biopsy take procedure - Up 4 cytology brush procedure Biopsies immediately freeze liquid nitrogen transfer -80 biorepository freezer long term storage . Blood immediately process transfer -80 biorepository freezer long-term storage . The translational pathology lab ( TPL ) maintain formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) block biopsy take routine care . Slides cut block study . Slide request research study exhaust archive tissue leave substantial amount formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) block potential future clinical use . If subject return additional esophagogastroduodenoscopies ( EGDs ) part routine care , study procedure repeat part registry detail . For subject receive routine care surveillance esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) current previous Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE ) current previous esophageal cancer ( ECA ) : Specimens data collect routine care surveillance EGD part study . For subject receive routine care treatment EGD current BE/ECA : Specimens data collect initial treatment EGD , subsequent treatment EGDs . Once treatment complete BE ECA clear , group begin surveillance EGDs part routine care condition . Specimens data collect subsequent follow-up surveillance EGDs treatment complete .</detailed_description>
