	<brief_title>VR-treadmill Combined Intervention Enhancing Mobility Cognitive Function Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , single blind , randomize control trial 6 month follow-up employed investigate effect treadmill train augment virtual reality patient MS . The study include 200 participant . Participants randomize either intervention active comparator . The intervention group receive 18 session Treadmill Training Virtual Reality ( TT+VR ) active control comparison receive 18 training session treadmill train alone ( TT ) without VR simulation All intervention deliver therapist train standard protocol . All subject train 3 time week 6 week , session last approximately 45 minutes.Training progression base increase motor cognitive challenge , individualize participant 's level performance .</detailed_description>
