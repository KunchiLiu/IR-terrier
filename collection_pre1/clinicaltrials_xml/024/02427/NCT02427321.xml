	<detailed_description>Flexible cystoscopy commonly use diagnosis post-treatment care bladder cancer , 7th common cancer United Kingdom . While equipment record bladder examination exists , simple quick use examination rarely record . Methods enhance image obtain examination also exist generally hardware base , require specific equipment , use fluorescent dye special endoscope , expensive clinical service provider , inconvenient patient may cause allergic reaction . The new proof-of-concept device record high-definition video lossless format computer hard-drive exist cystoscopy equipment connect . Additionally , device incorporates foot pedal allow operator `` bookmark '' point interest examination .
