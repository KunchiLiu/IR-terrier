	<detailed_description>The orthodontic thermoplastic device become affordable simple technique , due technological advancement . The main advantage appliance nearly invisible , see patient want show brace . Others reason search kind treatment removable . While eat , brush teeth even important social event , facility remove appliance . In hand appliance , accord american board association , finish treatment well conventional brace . Another problem every device place mouth plaque retentive , increase risk enamel demineralization . Also , device disrupt normal flow saliva , prevent buffering . This study analyse amount streptococcus mutans lactobacillus saliva biofilm teeth appliance , seeded culture medium . Another point , check prognosis gingival health owe contact device hole treatment .</detailed_description>
