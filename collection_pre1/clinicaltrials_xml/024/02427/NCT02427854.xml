	<brief_summary>In study investigator want assess complication associate pregnancy delivery , intervention use labor . Pregnancy delivery relate complication major health problem globally . Events labor excessive bleeding , uterine rupture , emergency cesarean delivery ; instrumental delivery anesthesia problem situation potentially may lead severe outcome mother child . Diabetes , anemia hypertensive disorder may also complicate pregnancy delivery . Between 60-80 % woman deliver first baby need suture due perineal tear ( tear locate area vagina anus ) . Superficial perineal tear rarely cause long-term problem , often lead pain discomfort immediately birth . Deeper severe perineal tear , involve anal sphincter , may influence woman 's quality life . This mainly due long-lasting pain , discomfort sexual dysfunction , fact obstetric anal sphincter tear main cause anal incontinence . Recent clinical intervention study show incidence severe obstetric perineal tear may reduce 50-70 % introduce bimanual support technique perineum . In study midwife gynecologist train bimanual support technique . When come train new medical technique general , study show use animated instruction mobile phone may good alternative traditional `` hands-on '' `` bedside '' teach method . In global perspective , important study efficacy mobile unit transfer new knowledge , especially use resource constrain setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main aim study incidence major delivery complication perineal injury vaginal delivery Palestine . A manual support technique perineum introduce . 1 . To assess incidence perineal tear , episiotomy , obstetric anal sphincter injury major obstetric complication Palestine multicenter study involve three hospital West Bank three hospital Gaza . 2 . To assess present treatment obstetric anal sphincter tear Palestine . 3 . To study whether intervention bed-side training hands-on `` Norwegian-Finnish '' support technique reduce incidence obstetric anal sphincter tear . 4 . To study whether training animated instruction hands-on support technique , use smart phone tablet computer , reduce incidence obstetric anal sphincter injury . 5 . To compare result two different train method . 6 . To study midwife ' doctor ' attitude towards `` hands-on '' training compare training animated instruction . The main aim ass incidence perineal injury vaginal delivery Palestine , introduce manual support technique perineum . Norwegian intervention study show incidence obstetric anal sphincter injury ( OASIS ) reduce 40-70 % improve hands-on delivering technique . The reduction achieve educate staff delivery unit , implement new hands-on delivering technique . Some previous research show non-interactive training animate instruction videos emergency obstetric care , might equally effective conventional interactive hands-on training . However , effectiveness training animate instruction compare conventional training program remain assessed properly . By perform multicentre intervention study , investigator explore effect interactive hands-on training incidence perineal injury . Likewise investigator study effect non-interactive training animated instruction . Three hospital West Bank ( WB ) three Gaza accept participate . The investigator also assess whether attitude towards train method influence result . The step observation , train intervention study : 1 . Intervention 1 ( 1 month ) : Education diagnosis repair perineal injury implementation system register data . 2 . Observation 1 ( 6 month ) : Data-registration baseline . 3 . Intervention 2 , ( 6 month ) : First part : In participate hospital , train hands-on manual perineal protection communicate animated instruction accessible tablet computer smart phone . The information instruction perform manual perineal protection transfer user instruction video show method animation voice-over Arabic English . All 6 hospital implement intervention simultaneously . Second part , step wedge approach : After one month first hospital start traditional bedside hands-on training midwife physician . Norwegian midwife obstetrician support training . The traditional bedside training start stepwise 6 hospital , one month , step wedge model . 4 . Observation 2 ( 12 month ) : There one year observational period data collect .</detailed_description>
