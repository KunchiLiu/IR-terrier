It speculate severe nasal inflammation due nasal polyps stimulate bone marrow produce eosinophil , increase supply blood eosinophil , consequently , major bronchial eosinophilic inflammation , aggravate asthma . However , noteworthy study evaluate clinical impact asthma endoscopic nasal polypectomy , scarce perform small number case , result inconsistent allow categorically whether positive association .

	<detailed_description>Sinonasal polyposis ( SP ) chronic inflammatory disease line nasal passage sinus , prevalence approximately 2-3 % general population . The prevalence asthma patient diagnose SP much great general population reach half case indicate severe phenotype bad control asthmatic patient without SP . It possible pathophysiologic mechanism underlie development SP concomitant asthma process consider disease . Recommendations major clinical practice guideline treatment SP include administration intranasal topical steroid high dos , subject respond treatment severe , administer course systemic steroid orally 10-14 day surgical intervention include polypectomy removal diseased mucosa endoscopically , know functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) . In context , noteworthy asthma patient , underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery bilateral polyposis ( FESS-BP ) state dramatically improve asthma surgery . This improvement could relate effect oral steroid patient often receive surgery , disappearance nasal discomfort cause nasal polyp ventilation improve intervention . However , reason sufficiently explain fact improvement , case extend month surgery , patient longer receive oral steroid . It speculate severe nasal inflammation involve presence nasal polyp would constantly stimulate bone marrow , cause one hand increase production eosinophil increase adhesiveness , thus , important eosinophilic bronchial inflammation . This line usual clinical observation accord patient asthma sinonasal polyposis , often suffer severe asthma ; severe sinus inflammation one aggravating factor recognize severe uncontrolled asthma . However , study assess clinical impact asthma FESS-BP , perform small number case . Consequently , result inconsistent allow categorically establish whether positive association exists . Most importantly , however , none include measurement bronchial inflammation study variable , hypothesis possible relationship eosinophilic bronchial inflammation nasal polyposis remain without test . Moreover , find FESS-BP provide objective improvement asthma , could future therapeutic option consider patient severe asthma sinonasal polyposis .</detailed_description>
