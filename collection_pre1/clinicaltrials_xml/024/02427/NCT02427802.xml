	<detailed_description>This phase 3 , randomize , control , blind , multicenter study conduct 3 parallel cohort diabetic patient least 1 infected foot ulcer . Patients randomize use electronic randomization system receive 1 3 study treatment ; systemic antibiotic therapy standard ulcer care either ( A ) daily application gentamicin-sponge , ( B ) daily application placebo-sponge ( C ) no-sponge , ratio 2:1:1 . The investigator blind patient 's treatment group assignment patient randomize one 2 sponge group blind whether sponge active placebo . If patient multiple infected ulcer , assign treatment administer infected ulcer . The investigator determine high severity ulcer use efficacy evaluation also determine size number sponge ( 4 ) patient use order completely cover infected ulcer . The investigator prescribe empiric systemic antibiotic therapy base protocol instruction . Patients treat approximately 28 day return clinic weekly safety efficacy assessment . The investigator stop study treatment patient achieve clinical cure 3rd treatment visit ( approximately study day 15 ) . After complete treatment , patient return clinic schedule follow-up visit ulcer closure . The final efficacy assessment use primary efficacy analysis obtain first follow-up visit approximately 10 day treatment stop . The remain follow-up visit occur approximately 30 , 60 90 day treatment stop patient assessed ulcer closure re-infection .</detailed_description>
