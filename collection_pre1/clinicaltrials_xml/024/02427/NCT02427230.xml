	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) intravaginal neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) effective reduce urinary incontinence improve quality life woman spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Urinary Incontinence Women With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCI patient often experience neurogenic bladder dysfunction neurogenic detrusor overactivity areflexic bladder . Due , 40-50 % SCI population suffers urinary incontinence , often reduce patient 's quality life . In order manage neurogenic bladder dysfunction , SCI patient use specialized bladder empty method , frequently clean intermittent catheterization . To reduce symptom neurogenic detrusor overactivity urinary incontinence patient SCI , medical anticholinergic therapy assess , effect sparse many adverse effect report . Injection Botulinum-A toxin bladder show great potential minimizing symptom neurogenic detrusor overactivity urinary incontinence , though expensive invasive method need repeat due temporary effect . PFMT NMES pelvic muscle non-invasive cheap treatment without side effect several study demonstrate positive effect intravaginal NMES and/or PFMT urinary incontinence able-bodied woman well woman neurological disorder like multiple sclerosis . Despite fact NMES weak paralyze striated muscle use decade patient suffer SCI , knowledge , study previously investigate effect PFMT intravaginal NMES woman SCI . The aim study evaluate effect PFMT intravaginal NMES Urinary Incontinence Quality Life woman SCI . In particular , investigate potential additional effect intravaginal NMES , NMES conduct combination PFMT . This study design randomized clinical trial , investigate effect PFMT alone combination intravaginal NMES . We include 40 female patient incomplete SCI urinary incontinence . After physiotherapeutic guidance , patient perform PFMT PFMT + NMES daily home 12 week follow-up evaluation every fourth week .</detailed_description>
