	<brief_summary>The important consideration design clinical trial ensure safe translation personalize synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) dictate initial study biologic therapy perform way balance potential risk benefit individual patient . Consistent recommendation , investigator target patient triple-negative breast cancer pathologic complete response neoadjuvant chemotherapy . These patient typically gross evidence disease follow standard care therapy ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy , surgery radiation therapy ) extremely high-risk disease recurrence . Targeting patient population provide window-of-opportunity design manufacture personalize cancer vaccine , maximize potential benefit vaccine regulatory network associate metastatic disease present , balance risk patient population extremely high risk disease recurrence treatment option .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis invasive breast cancer . ER PR less Allred score 3 less 1 % positive staining cell invasive component tumor HER2 negative FISH IHC stain 0 1+ . Consented genome sequencing dbGAPbased data share provide provide germline tumor DNA sample adequate quality sequence . Fresh tissue prefer ( biopsy time port placement ) archival tissue allow . Clinical stage T2T4c , N , M0 primary tumor AJCC 7th edition clinical stag prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy , residual invasive breast cancer neoadjuvant therapy . If patient invasive cancer contralateral breast , eligible study . At least 18 year age . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 Adequate organ marrow function 14 day prior registration define : WBC ≥3,000/μL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/μL platelets ≥100,000/μL total bilirubin ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal AST/ALT ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal Women reproductive potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Able understand willing sign IRBapproved write informed consent document . Evidence progressive breast cancer within last 30 day . Received chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic therapy within last 30 day ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy exclude ) . Experiencing adverse event due agent administer 30 day earlier . Receiving investigational agent ( ) receive investigational agent within last 30 day . Known metastatic disease . Invasive cancer contralateral breast . Known allergy , history serious adverse reaction vaccine anaphylaxis , hive , respiratory difficulty . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia ( include sinus bradycardia ) , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Prior currently active autoimmune disease require management immunosuppression . This include inflammatory bowel disease , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , systemic vasculitis , scleroderma , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis , hemolytic anemia , immunemediated thrombocytopenia , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjorgen 's syndrome , sarcoidosis , rheumatologic disease medical condition use medication ( e.g. , corticosteroid ) might make difficult patient complete full course treatment generate immune response vaccine . Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require daily systemic corticosteroid acceptable . Any patient receive steroid discuss PI determine eligible . Pregnant breastfeeding . A negative serum pregnancy test require 7 day study entry . The patient previous history nonbreast malignancy eligible study patient meet follow criterion cancer survivor . A cancer survivor eligible provide follow criterion meet : ( 1 ) patient undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy , ( 2 ) patient consider disease free least 1 year ( exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinomainsitu cervix ) . Patient must active major medical psychosocial problem could complicate study participation . Known HIVpositive status . These patient ineligible potential inability generate immune response vaccine . Subjects strong likelihood nonadherence difficulty adhere followup schedule due geographic distance Siteman Cancer Center knowingly register .</criteria>
