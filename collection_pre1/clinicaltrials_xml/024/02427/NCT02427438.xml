	<brief_title>Home Program Education Patients With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately fifty percent patient seek help outpatient orthopedic clinic roughly thirty percent people experience low back pain ( LBP ) time life . ( 1 ) LBP second lead cause miss day work per year result around ninety billion dollar per year medical cost . ( 1 ) Physical therapy intervention LBP could include manual therapy , exercise , traction , range motion , modality , postural education , combination intervention . ( 2-5 ) Medical treatment LBP could include medication , image , laboratory study , injection , surgery , counsel pain psychology . ( 6-7 ) Many research study inconclusive regard effective treatment . In 1995 treatment base classification system patient acute low back pain publish . ( 8 ) Patients categorize one four category : manipulation , directional exercise ( flexion , extension , lateral shift correction ) , immobilization , traction . ( 8 ) This classification system lead validation category clinical prediction rule ( CPR ) relate best treatment outcome . ( 9-11 ) In 2005 , Hicks build upon initial classification system immobilization publish preliminary CPR identifying patient likely benefit lumbar stabilization . ( 10 ) Hicks identify follow predictor patient response stabilization exercise : individual young age forty , straight leg raise great ninety-one degree , aberrant motion positive prone instability test . ( 10 ) Hicks report presence three variable positive likelihood ratio 4.0 95 % confidence interval . ( 10 ) However , study date confirm result validate clinical prediction rule . Home program prescription background Evidence use video home program prescription limit . However , video base home program successfully use patient Huntington 's disease , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , spinal cord injury , brachial plexus injury , general shoulder strengthening . ( 12-15 ) Medical study demonstrate patient comprehend information well communicate via educational video oppose educational pamphlet various disorder . ( 16-18 ) Problem Statement : Currently , literature evaluate use video home program patient LBP identifying may benefit form clinical education . Home program handout frequently depict photograph figure incorrect form instruction . Video base home program demonstrate stabilization technique patient may provide correct form accurate instruction . With program , patient comprehension technical reproduction exercise may improve . Video-based home program could lead few clinic visit decrease cost per episode care . Given numerous factor contribute limited clinic visit LBP patient , effective communication beneficial treatment . We know patient learning style may influence compliance vary mode home exercise program prescription . Video base home exercise program may also better fit patient auditory visual learner define Visual , Auditory , Reading , Kinesthetic ( VARK ) learn inventory . ( 19 ) Auditory learner prefer information transfer listening . Visual learner prefer map , chart , perhaps videos write chart instruction .</detailed_description>
