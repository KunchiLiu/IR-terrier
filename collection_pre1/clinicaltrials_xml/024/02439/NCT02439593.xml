	<brief_title>Concurrent Hyperthermia Chemoradiotherapy LAPC : Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II randomize trial part comprehensive protocol design locally advanced pancreatic cancer ( LAPC ) . All patient LAPC , fulfil follow criterion `` Unresectable LAPC '' would consider eligible enrolment study . These include : 1 . Major venous infiltration / thrombosis portal vein superior mesenteric vein extend several centimeter ( preclude vein resection reconstruction ) 2 . Tumor encasement ( ≥180° ) superior mesentric artery proximal hepatic artery 3 . Tumor abutment ( &lt; 180° ) celiac trunk 4 . Tumor invasion aorta 5 . Presence metastasis lymph node beyond field resection All patient would review Pancreas Cancer Tumor Board , University Hospital Zurich fulfil condition/s would consider study protocol LAPC . Following detailed work , eligible patient primary tumour 4 cm would consider HEATPAC study . Patients would randomize random digit use double blind strategy either ( ) Control group : Treated concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( b ) Study group : Treated local hyperthermia along concurrent chemoradiotherapy . Treatment group would initiate 4 cycle neo-adjuvant chemotherapy ( FOLFIRINOX ) . At completion 4 cycle neo-adjuvant FOLFIRINIOX , patient would evaluate PET-CT , 3-4 week follow last cycle FOLFIRINIOX . Patients control group would take concurrent gemcitabine ( 400 mg / sq.m weekly ) along loco-regional radiotherapy SIB-IMRT dose 50.4 Gy 28 fraction . Patients study group would receive loco-regional hyperthermia temperature 40-41°C , weekly 1 hour gemcitabine radiotherapy . The gemcitabine loco-regional radiotherapy study group would similar control group . Following completion treatment , patient group would consider 8 cycle adjuvant FOLFIRINOX follow clinical , heamatological imaging study detail study protocol . Primary endpoint : 1 . Overall survival 1 year 2 . To assess acute late morbidity associate hyperthermia chemoradiotherapy concurrent chemoradiotherapy compare concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone . Secondary endpoint : 1 . To compare disease free survival patient locally advance pancreatic cancer follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy FOLOFIRINOX treat hyperthermia chemoradiotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy alone . 2 . To assess pattern failure ( local systemic ) patient treatment arm .</detailed_description>

Estimated life expectancy least 6 month 10 . Adequate kidney functionality define creatinine clearance &gt; 50ml/min 11 . Adequate liver functionality define total bilirubin ≤ 2x upper limit normal 12 . Adequate bone marrow reserve : White blood cell count ≥ 2.5 x 10˄9/L , Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10˄9/L , Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0g/L 13 . Women childbearing age must secure sufficient contraception control clinical trial six month clinical trial complete 14 . For female child bear potential , negative pregnancy test within 2 week prior randomization . 15 . Female patient lactate 16 . Absence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition could potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule 1 . Histopathology ductal adenocarcinoma pancreas 2 . Prior radiotherapy site treatment 3 . Patients unequivocal distant metastasis include liver 4 . Patients gross peritoneal carcinomatosis laparoscopy 5 . No prior concurrent malignancy surgically treat squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin 6 . No serious medical illness would prevent informed consent limit survival le 2 year 7 . Active uncontrolled bacterial , viral fungal infection condition correct control . 8 . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition would preclude patient meeting study requirement . 9 . Patients metal implant , pacemaker cluster marker . 10 . Metallic endobiliary stenting would contraindication , hence plastic stent may use biliary drainage indicate . 11 . Patient history myocardial infarction within past 12 month 12 . No connective disease disorder contraindicate radiotherapy , e.g. , Scleroderma 13 . Preexisting grade 2 peripheral neuropathy 14 . Any known contraindication hypersensitivity chemotherapeutic agent 15 . Pregnancy , lactation period lack reliable contraception 16 . Any disease therapy , , present risk patient compatible aim clinical trial 17 . Patients would express inability travel Kantonsspital Aarau , ( KSA ) hyperthermia treatment 18 .
