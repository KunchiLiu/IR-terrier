	<brief_title>Prediction Response Neoadjuvant Therapy Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , treatment NCRT revolutionise management LARC . In addition downstaging tumour 62 % case , half decrease 1 T stage ; pathological complete response ( pCR ) , viable tumour cell leave resected specimen , demonstrate 30 % patient . Only 3 % patient show progressive disease . It recently show pathological complete response survive longer partial response , figure 5-year disease free survival quote 83 91 % pCR ; versus 65 % non pCR . Furthermore , argue tumour sensitive radiotherapy favourable biological tumour profile , few propensity recur metastasise aggressive non-radiosensitive tumour . The key accurately able identify patient exhibit complete response radiotherapy , predict might show complete response . Positron Emission Tomography ( 18-F-FDG-PET-CT ) tumour biomarker radiotherapy show able predict patient respond chemo radiotherapy , sensitivity 79 % specificity 88 % . Texture Analysis ( TA ) assess aggressiveness tumour assess intra-tumoural heterogeneity . It already show effective assess biological characteristic solid tumour , include oesophagus , breast , liver . The aim study utilise two novel molecular image technique identify rectal cancer patient respond completely neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy . Parameters calculate change measurable variable baseline post treatment scan . Pilot data The watch-and-wait approach could potentially reduce treatment-related toxicity select rectal cancer patient clinical complete response ( cCR ) chemoradiation . The `` watch &amp; wait '' protocol adopt study perform Brazil , United Kingdom , Netherlands . Studies indicate accurate assessment response neoadjuvant therapy key select patient benefit watch &amp; wait approach . Therefore , determine modality high accuracy cost-effectiveness holy grail manage locally advanced rectal cancer . A study perform Chief Investigator efficiency accuracy 18-F-FDG-PET-CT conclude PET-CT proven role cost effective monitoring therapy detect recurrence colorectal cancer ; technology combine picomolar sensitivity high-resolution CT imaging . It therefore show sensitive plain CT image detect recurrence monitoring response therapy . In study , report accuracy PET-CT determine responsiveness NCRT around 80 % . Baseline PET-CT subsequent PET-CT parameter , include SUV-based measurement , show highly accurate determine response NCRT . Texture Analysis biomarker technique measure heterogeneity within solid tumour . Textural parameter ( coefficient variation [ COV ] , skewness , kurtosis ) apply PET-CT image show able predict response NCRT , predict survival . A pilot study perform institution indeed show textural parameter perform pelvic MRI associate improved overall survival disease- free survival . Study hypothesis - PET-CT restaging do 9 week rather 6 week accurate predictor assess response NCRT . - Texture analysis rectal MRI scan strong biomarker assess tumour response identify patient Complete Response .</detailed_description>
