	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease common serious disease , lead cause death worldwide . Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) common often under-diagnosed coronary artery disease could involve pathophysiology perhaps prognosis . The entanglement two pathology actually quite well know , particular consequence one begin study . Understanding pathophysiology new image modality improve management patient propose new approach . `` SAS-IDM '' interventional prospective study conduct University Hospital Montpellier . Patients divide three group depend result polysomnography : 1/ AHI &lt; 5/h : normal , without OSA ; 2/ 5/h ≤ AHI &lt; 30/h : mild moderate OSA ; 3/ IAH ≥ 30/h : severe OSA . A treatment CPAP propose patient group `` severe OSA '' .</brief_summary>
