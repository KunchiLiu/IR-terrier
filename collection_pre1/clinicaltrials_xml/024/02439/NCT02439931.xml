	<brief_title>Remote Psychosocial Intervention Brain Tumour Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose There would strong value develop brief , manualized , remotely deliver , intervention capable simultaneously improve emotional well cognitive function survivor malignant brain tumour . The propose study design test acceptability , feasibility , apparent efficacy , area improvement newly develop intervention design purpose . This investigation undertaken step toward conduct randomized clinical trial . Research Questions As feasibility study hypothesis test study . Instead , research conduct order answer follow four question intervention : 1 . How acceptable intervention ? 2 . How feasible intervention ? 3 . How much apparent efficacy intervention ? 4 . How could involve process improve ? Further follow three question ask around remote neuropsychological test procedure : 1 . How feasible remote neuropsychological testing ? 2 . How valid remote neuropsychological testing ? 3 . How could neuropsychological test process improve ? Justification A general justification propose research offer . Brain tumour survivor demonstrate high level psychopathology . For example , find exhibit level clinical depression three time higher found cancer patient overall . This find particularly important symptom depression also find strong single predictor overall quality life primary brain tumour survivor . The cognitive impact brain cancer , diverse , also strongly negative effect quality life . Impairments area memory , attention , executive functioning common cognitive deficit involve . Despite depth suffering , researcher date do relatively little work develop psychologically base intervention help ameliorate emotional cognitive sequela . More specifically , remote aspect intervention justify fact population face multiple barrier come clinic need psychosocial care , include : geographical isolation ; cognitive impairment ; drive prohibition ; fatigue . This reality reflect fact previous researcher report face face strong challenge recruit participant time consume intervention study kind population . A remote intervention may offer mean overcome barrier access . Finally , due lengthy wait time factor , also population often struggle receive need neuropsychological test timely manner . Therefore , also value validate brief , remotely delivered neuropsychological testing procedure population , beyond role play validate particular intervention investigation . Objectives This study four primary objective : 1. develop deliver remotely deliver psychosocial intervention high need population 2. develop neuropsychological battery remotely deliver population 3. answer four question list regard intervention 4. answer three question list regard neuropsych assessment process Research Design The propose design involve mixed method feasibility study design . A variety data source use order address 7 research question list . These data source include : self report questionnaire ; neuropsychological test battery ; fill-in blank questionnaire ; interview ; focus group . 6 ) Statistical Analysis The included type quantitative data analysis : descriptive statistic ; effect size ; repeat measure ANOVA .</detailed_description>
