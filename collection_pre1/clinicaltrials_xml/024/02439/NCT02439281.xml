	<brief_title>Ropivacaine With Clonidine For Pediatric Rectus Sheath Blocks- The Magic Combination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary aim determine ropivacaine combine clonidine prolongs duration paresthesia umbilicus . The secondary aim determine use clonidine decrease anxiety level , prolongs duration analgesia , decrease pain severity umbilicus laparoscopic site , reduces need pain medication , improve satisfaction pain control , associate complication oversedation , hypotension , bradycardia . Specific Aims : Aim 1 determine duration sensory block ( paresthesia ) ultrasound guide single injection rectus sheath block perform ropivacaine/ clonidine long duration paresthesia rectus sheath block perform ropivacaine alone . The investigator hypothesize rectus sheath injection ropivacaine clonidine result long duration sensory block ( paresthesia ) compare ropivacaine alone . Aim 2 determine use clonidine decrease postoperative anxiety score postoperative pain score correlate anxiety score . The investigator hypothesize patient postoperative anxiety score low Ropivacaine/Clonidine group postoperative anxiety score decrease Ropivacaine /Clonidine Group , Ropivacaine Group . The investigator expect preoperative postoperative Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) score report patient correlate moderately ( 0.3-0.49 ) high ( equal /or &gt; 0.5 ) preoperative postoperative anxiety level . Aim 3 determine rectus sheath injection ropivacaine/ clonidine prolongs duration analgesia umbilicus instrument site , decrease analgesic consumption , improve satisfaction pain control , minimal complication oversedation , bradycardia , hypotension . The investigator hypothesize rectus sheath injection ropivacaine/ clonidine would result long duration analgesia compare ropivacaine alone , low pain score umbilicus , less need pain medication consumption pain umbilicus first 18 hour , good satisfaction pain control patient , parent nurse . The investigator expect difference incidence oversedation , hypotension , bradycardia episode . Background : Millions pediatric patient undergo laparoscopic surgery every year many suffer significant pain day surgery subsequent day . Pain sensory emotional experience , modify multiple factor , include anxiety . Patient 's anxiety correlate severity pain . Children anxious surgery find postoperative pain , delay hospital discharge , high incidence emergence delirium , sleep disturbance , maladaptive behavior change last week follow surgery . Laparoscopic appendectomy cause significant pain anxiety despite minimally invasive approach . The investigator ' recent complete prospective study show day surgery , pain laparoscopic appendectomy correlate well postoperative anxiety score ( Pearson coefficient =0.539 ; pending publication result 133 subject , 11-17 year old , underwent laparoscopic appendectomy ) . Effective postoperative analgesia laparoscopic appendectomy necessary optimal recovery . A multimodal approach include regional analgesia technique , improve analgesia , reduce side-effects opioids use . Unfortunately , pain associated procedure extend day surgery . Continuous peripheral nerve block effective , deem excessively invasive context minimally invasive surgery . Single injection nerve block appropriate , duration long act local anesthetic around 12 hour , match painful part postoperative period , first 24 hour . Over last year , challenge develop block agent last long enough outlast pain minimal side effect address combine different drug ( epinephrine , clonidine , dexamethasone , tramadol , buprenorphine , midazolam , magnesium , dexmedetomidine , ketamine ) yield mixed result . Among , clonidine , alpha 2 adrenoreceptor agonist show prolong duration analgesia administer epidural space child . Clonidine also add local anesthetic peripheral nerve block perineural use controversial exact mechanism unclear . Its action entirely attribute alpha -adrenergic effect nerve ; rather , possibly secondary blockade current hyperpolarization- activate cyclic nucleotide-gated channel , result enhancement activity-dependent hyperpolarization . From limited available data , perineurally administer clonidine appear safe , result remain controversial . Adult metaanalysis find clonidine 30-300 mcg prolongs time first analgesic request 2-2.5 hr . Furthermore , clonidine prolong sensory motor blockade local anesthetic except mepivacaine . The pediatric literature regard use clonidine peripheral nerve block lag behind adult literature conflicting . Few small under-powered study show best weak trend favor clonidine . A retrospective review 215 patient show use clonidine prolongs duration infraclavicular , lumbar plexus , femoral , fascia iliaca sciatic nerve block 20-50 % . However , prolongation block location dependent , increase incidence motor block . This effect see dilute concentration bupivacaine 0.125 % ropivacaine 0.2 % . No pediatric adult study perform involve trunk block rectus sheath , transversus abdominis plane , paravertebral nerve block . Side effect report clonidine administer neuraxially perineurally hypotension , sedation , fainting , prolong motor blockade . Hypotension sedation appear limited dos 150 mcg . However , Petroheilou et al . report intraoperatively hemodynamic stability administration clonidine 3 mcg/kg . Clonidine 1-2 mcg/kg suggest use local anesthetic single injection peripheral nerve block . Clonidine help relieve postoperative anxiety , subsequently improve pain control . Minimal sedation clonidine administration desire pediatric patient . Clonidine 2 mcg/kg prevents sevoflurane-induced agitation use premedication child . No study investigate role anxiolytic add local anesthetic nerve block . The Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( CHP UPMC ) dedicate service provide regional anesthesia technique perform peripheral nerve block regular basis . Over last academic year , 190 patient underwent laparoscopic appendectomy peripheral nerve block ( rectus sheath transversus abdominis plane ) perform pain control . Children localize majority pain umbilicus instrument site . This pain interfere patient ' activity ambulation , eat , bedside activity . The principal investigator perform retrospective chart review compare postoperative analgesia rectus sheath block combination transversus abdominis plane rectus sheath block . The postoperative opioid consumption pain score similar . Since , primary investigator performs ultrasound guide rectus sheath block postoperative analgesia laparoscopic appendectomy . A recent pediatric study show rectus sheath block combination multimodal analgesia effective postoperative pain control mention procedure . Unfortunately duration block perform maximum 20 ml bupivacaine 0.25 % adrenaline outlast painful period . The investigator believe rectus sheath block ropivacaine 0.5 % clonidine ( 2 mcg/kg ) prolong duration block , reduce postoperative pain anxiety , facilitate discharge , decrease unplanned hospital admission secondary pain , contribute increase patient family satisfaction , decrease cost hospital , insurer , patient . Significance : To investigator ' knowledge , first study investigate whether ropivacaine /clonidine rectus sheath blockade well complete therapeutic regimen patient undergo laparoscopic appendectomy . While patient underwent uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy treat inpatient least one day , CHP want implement early discharge strategy . Unfortunately , pain day surgery significant parent reluctant child discharge . The analgesia advices poorly retain . The parent feel overwhelmed home pain management . Some parent believe use pain medication childhood may lead later drug abuse . This concern parent often undermedicate child 's pain , 60 % parent administer less prescribed analgesia follow day surgery discharge . A child long lasting pain control less anxiety ropivacaine/clonidine rectus sheath blockade help parent cope surgical event , facilitate early discharge . Additionally , patient 's satisfaction pain control become increasingly important aspect health care reimbursement report via Hospital Assessment Healthcare Providers Systems ( HCAHPS ) survey . The ropivacaine/ clonidine rectus sheath blockade combination multimodal therapy well therapeutic regimen standard care , improve quality care , increase satisfaction save health care cost .</detailed_description>
