	<brief_title>Phase I Dose Escalation Expansion Oral BAY 1143269 Combination With Intravenous Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BAY 1143269 potent selective , orally administer novel inhibitor mitogen-activated protein kinase interact serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 ( MKNK1 ) . MKNK1 activity essential phosphorylation eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ( eIF4E ) , promote synthesis oncogenic protein , inhibits apoptosis , help tumor cell survive stress . Increased p-EIF4E level find tumor tissue cancer patient . MKNK also function mediator pro-inflammatory cytokine production . Established anti-mitotic drug vinca alkaloid , taxanes , epothilones activate spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) , key surveillance mechanism monitor attachment spindle microtubule kinetochore chromosome pro-metaphase halt transition anaphase chromosome bi-oriented , fully attach , correctly tense metaphase plate . These antimitotic drug destabilize stabilize spindle microtubule cause mitotic arrest . Prolonged arrest mitosis force cell either mitotic exit without cytokinesis mitotic catastrophe lead cell death . MKNK1 inhibitor allow cell apoptosis increase tumor death . The combination taxane MKNK1 inhibitor ultimately delay tumor progression may provide useful anticancer therapeutic approach . This study attempt answer follow question : - What maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) BAY 1143269 give alone combination docetaxel ? - What safety profile pharmacokinetics BAY1143269 give MTD ? - What adverse event BAY 1161909 give different dose level docetaxel ?</detailed_description>
