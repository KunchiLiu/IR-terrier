	<brief_title>A Registry Determine Clinical Genetic Risk Factors Torsade De Pointes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Drug-induced long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) , subsequent fatal arrhythmia torsade de pointes ( TdP ) , important side effect associate use number medication . Prolongation QT interval common cause withdrawal medication already market , despite relatively rarity non-cardiovascular drug , public health impact magnify fact drug-induced TdP occur medication use benign condition , allergic rhinitis . The QT interval heritable , number common genetic variant associate QT interval large population study . Although common genetic variant associate sudden cardiac death identify , study specifically identify variant associate drug-induced LQTS TdP limit . Smaller study suggest variant gene associate QT interval duration population general also associate risk drug-induced QT prolongation TdP , large study need . Moreover , improve ability predict cause TdP require careful search clinical factor associate TdP compare control . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A . Study Design Enrollment : We propose conduct multi-center research study examine know explore potentially unknown genetic clinical predictor torsade de pointes ( TdP ) also know acquire long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) creation registry . Any patient documented history torsade de pointes ( TdP ) event eligible . Patients must able understand risk genetic testing , willing undergo venipuncture blood collection genotyping . Exclusion criterion include inability provide inform consent . We plan enroll total 200 study participant total across participate center . Massachusetts General Hospital coordinate center multi-center study medical institution within great Boston New England area . In substudy take place MGH , subject invite punch biopsy skin allow creation inducible pluripotent stem cell differentiate cardiomyocytes characterization repolarization phenotype . B . Study Procedures : We screen patient enrollment include retrospective ( event prior start study ) prospective ( event follow start study ) component . Patients identify investigator base clinical characteristic , follow explanation study co-investigators , ask participation either routine schedule follow-up ( retrospective case ) sentinel event . Investigators complete data collection form patient , include contact information , demographic information , clinical information , family history pedigree , electrocardiography information available ( 12-lead ECGs , rhythm strip summary report ) . No information mental illness collect . Patients undergo venipuncture , four 5mL blood sample collect genotyping plasma analysis . For patient willing , 3mm punch biopsy shoulder , upper thigh , small back , buttock ( subject 's choice ) obtain fibroblast culture . Patients recruit non-MGH site visit MGH schedule order obtain skin biopsy . Induced pluripotent stem cell make fibroblast culture differentiate cardiomyocytes order ass cellular phenotype . Patients also consent future re-contact additional data , information , sample need analysis . All clinical information sample ( include DNA blood ) collect participate center transfer Dr. Newton-Cheh MGH storage analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For simplicity , plan include possible case TdP meeting criterion ( see ) registry . Exclusion criterion include : 1. age &lt; 18 year old 2. inability obtain informed consent patient family member 3. exclusion basis race gender . Inclusion : torsade de pointes clinical syndrome accord one follow three clinical criterion : 1 . Definite TdP : At least 3 beat polymorphic ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) 12lead ECG rhythm strip document QTc &gt; 450 m men QTc &gt; 470 woman ( exclude patient conduction block AF baseline , see ) prior arrhythmic event . 2 . Probable TdP : At least 3 beat polymorphic VT VF 12lead ECG rhythm strip QTc &gt; 450ms ( men ) 470ms ( woman ) event , polymorphic VT VF episode meeting criterion 'definite TdP ' determine adjudicate physician likely TdP . For patient cardiac arrest , least 1 hour restoration normal rhythm secondary hypoxia electrolyte abnormality rule ( confounders QT prolongation often see postarrest47 ) require . 3 . Possible TdP : Unexplained syncope patient present QTc &gt; 450ms ( men ) 470ms ( woman ) .</criteria>
