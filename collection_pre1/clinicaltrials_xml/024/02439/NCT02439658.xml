	<brief_title>Genetics QT Prolongation With Antiarrhythmics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug-induced long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) , subsequent fatal arrhythmia torsade de pointes ( TdP ) , major concern use number medication . Prolongation QT interval common cause withdrawal medication already market , despite relatively rarity non-cardiovascular drug , public health impact magnify fact drug-induced TdP occur medication use benign condition , allergic rhinitis . The QT interval heritable , number common genetic variant associate QT interval large population study . Dofetilide commonly use anti-arrhythmic medication know associated drug-induced LQTS degree Federal Drug Administration require mandatory 3 day hospitalization initiation screen QT prolongation . Sotalol also commonly-used anti-arrhythmic medication associate drug-induced LQTS require 3 day hospitalization initiation , although FDA-specified initiation protocol like dofetilide . Although certain clinical predictor associate prolongation QT dofetilide sotalol , limited information genetic predictor QT prolongation . As identification genetic predictor could help identify potentially toxic response medication , plan examine genetic predictor QT interval QT prolongation dofetilide sotalol . In addition , assess feasibility ( safety ) use genetic-guided outpatient initiation , plan study accuracy AliveCor device measure QT interval select patient . STUDY OVERVIEW : This study multi-center study attempt identify genetic factor influence QT interval response dofetilide sotalol . One goal study determine whether genetics might identify individual low enough genetic risk QT prolongation outpatient initiation might feasible . As additional safety measure approach might include ambulatory QT measurement , would also like test accuracy smart phone-based device measure QT interval call AliveCor device . The dofetilide sotalol use solely determine clinical staff independent research study base standard clinical care . The research component study include additional collection blood genetic analysis , collection subject data CRF copy electrocardiograms perform part routine clinical care . This study perform Harvard hospital include MGH , BWH , BIDMC , eligible participation cede review ( MGH = primary ) . Other hospital may participate include West Roxbury VA ; local IRB approval seek center participate Harvard cede review process . Data collect individual hospital co-investigators/site PIs store locally accord IRB requirement . Copies CRFs , ECGs blood sample genetic analysis forward MGH , serve coordinate analysis center ( well recruit center ) . Data encode possible ; however , due impracticality remove patient identifier certain data type , medication list ECGs , data contain patient information transport store MGH . Dr. Newton-Cheh serve overall study PI . The investigator propose conduct research study examine know explore potentially unknown genetic predictor QT response patient admit dofetilide sotalol initiation part routine clinical care . Any patient admit participate institution purpose dofetilide sotalol initiation eligible . Patients must able understand risk genetic testing , willing undergo venipuncture blood collection genotyping . Exclusion criterion include inability provide inform consent . The investigator plan enroll goal 500 study participant total across participate center , although due low expect enrollment dofetilide alone , investigator include sotalol well improve statistical power . Patients identify investigator base planned admission dofetilide sotalol initiation , follow explanation study co-investigator , ask study participation inform consent obtain . Investigators complete data collection form patient , include contact information , demographic information , clinical information , family history pedigree , electrocardiography information available ( tracing , report ) . Those individual agree undergo AliveCor testing educate use device , clean quality tracing obtain , record , process , send via email study investigation email ( QTstudies @ partners.org ) . The time date record record case report form , allow link transmission . No identify patient information enter onto AliveCor application , thus identify information send internet , transmit AliveCor company . No information mental illness collect . Patients undergo venipuncture , four 5mL blood sample ( tube ) collect genotyping . Patients also consent future re-contact additional data , information , sample need analysis .</detailed_description>
