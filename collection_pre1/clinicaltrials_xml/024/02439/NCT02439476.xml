	<brief_summary>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) incurable disease characterize accumulation clonal plasma cell bone marrow . While MM patient relapse disease may achieve response subsequent antimyeloma therapy , duration response decrease successive relapse resistant disease develop . Until recently , median survival follow relapse induction therapy approximately one year . The relatively recent US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval bortezomib ( 2003 ) combination lenalidomide plus dexamethasone ( 2006 ) therapy treatment previously treat MM provide effective therapeutic option give patient relapse refractory MM prospect prolongation overall progression-free survival time . However , MM remain incurable disease . A clear unmet medical need still exist additional novel therapeutic option treatment previously treat MM . Plerixafor reversibly inhibit CXCR4 bind stromal cell derive factor ( SDF ) -1alpha recently discover effective agent mobilize CD34+ cell peripheral blood . In normal volunteer , administer Plerixafor 4-5 day G-CSF result 3-3.5 fold increase circulate CD34+ cell . Two phase 3 study demonstrate combination G-CSF Plerixafor superior G-CSF alone mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cell front-line salvage therapy patient multiple myeloma . Nevertheless , almost patient ultimately relapse , plateau observe survival curve . At time disease recurrence , one standard salvage approach , instead , various therapeutic option available , include novel agents-based therapy , administer fix duration time progression . In pivotal trial approval bortezomib monotherapy relapse refractory MM , median PFS 7 month , whereas pivotal trial approval lenalidomide combination dexamethasone group patient , median time progression approximately 11 month . A recent prospective , randomize , phase 3 study show triplet combination bortezomib , thalidomide dexamethasone ( VTD ) achieve superior result compare thalidomide dexamethasone ( TD ) alone patient relapse follow ASCT , median time progression 19.5 versus 13.8 month , respectively . This study suggest combination consist IMiD proteasome inhibitor valuable option time relapse . However , frozen graft available , also possible repeat high-dose therapy patient previously respond frontline application high-dose melphalan ASCT . Over time , several report demonstrate feasibility salvage strategy . The majority data available retrospective study base single-centre experience small number select patient . In set , PFS show range 7 22 month , treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) acceptable , range 0 8 % . Various prognostic factor prolong PFS describe , duration response first high-dose therapy , number line therapy prior salvage ASCT . With background , prospective non-interventional multicentre study aim collect data feasibility salvage ASCT use Plerixafor-based stem cell mobilization relapse MM , accord Plerixafor label France . This non-interventional study ; visit perform usual , accord center practice . No additional visit request study purpose . The date visit data generate must record appropriate eCRF . The study consist 3 period : - An early screening period - Autologous stem cell mobilization period - High dose melphalan therapy autologous graft infusion follow-up for12 month salvage ASCT Inclusion visit This visit may occur 28 day Mozobil® administration . This visit perform visit pre-transplant assessment . For pre-transplant assessment , procedure perform routinely ASCT even patient include study : Stem cell mobilization phase The stem cell mobilization phase perform accord standard practice participate centre . Follow-up visit High dose melphalan administration autologous graft infusion perform accord centre standard practice . Patients follow accord center practice . The follow-up non-interventional study end 12 month ASCT . Subjects enrol 2 year period . The total duration study 36 month</brief_summary>
