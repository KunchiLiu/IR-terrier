	<brief_summary>The combined pulmonary fibrosis emphysema syndrome ( CPFE ) individualize group 2005 characterize often severe dyspnea , almost exclusive male predominance , often major , profound impairment gas exchange contrast preserve lung volume absence airflow obstruction , high risk pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension responsible increase mortality . Almost patient smoker ex-smokers . There argument favor genetic abnormality syndrome unknown etiology ( smoke ) include short telomere mutation telomerase complex gene . There also emphysematous lesion , patient familial pulmonary fibrosis , mutation SFTPC gene ( surfactant protein C ) , report case CPFE syndrome SFTPC mutation . No large genetic study conduct date CPFE syndrome . Our main hypothesis proportion subject short telomere higher among patient CPFE syndrome subject similar age idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis without emphysema . It previously show mutation telomerase TERT TERC gene mostly find people whose telomere abnormally short . The investigator propose use test identify patient likely carry mutation , seek , among , mutation TERT TERC telomerase gene . The objective study compare proportion patient short telomere group patient CPFE syndrome patient ( idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis without emphysema , emphysema without fibrosis ) .</brief_summary>
