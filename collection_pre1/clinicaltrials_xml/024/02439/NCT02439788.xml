	<brief_summary>This research study patient cancer call Neuroblastoma either come back treatment respond standard medicine use treat . This study combine two different way fight cancer : antibody Natural Killer T cell . Antibodies type protein protect body infectious diseases possibly cancer . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include cell infected virus tumor cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer . The investigator find previous research put new gene T cell make recognize cancer cell kill . In previous clinical trial , investigator make gene call chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) , antibody call 14g2a recognizes GD2 , molecule find almost neuroblastoma cell ( GD2-CAR ) . They put gene patient ' T cell give back patient neuroblastoma . Nineteen patient treat study long term side-effects see GD2 T cell infusion . As investigator follow patient time , noticed patient disease time infusion , time progression ( amount time take neuroblastoma got bad ) long could find GD2 T cell blood 6 week last T cell infusion . Because , investigator think effector cell able last long , may better chance kill neuroblastoma tumor cell . Natural Killer T cell special subset innate lymphocyte effectively go tumor tissue neuroblastoma . Inside tumor , certain white blood cell help cancer cell grow recover injury . Natural Killer T-cells specifically kill cell . In study , Natural Killer T cell genetically engineer express GD2-CAR attack neuroblastoma cell white blood cell inside tumor tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To prepare neuroblastoma specific Natural Killer T cell ( also call GINAKIT cell ) , 80 mL ( 6 tablespoon ) blood collect patient . For child , total amount blood drawn 3 ml ( le 1 teaspoon ) per 2.2 lb body weight . In case neuroblastoma specific Natural Killer T cell expand amount blood safely draw patient , investigator may attempt collect white blood cell patient use special type blood donation call leukocyte apheresis . Unlike regular blood draw `` whole blood '' donation whole blood remove patient 's body , apheresis process connects patient machine remove particular component blood return rest blood back . The white blood cell collect leukocyte apheresis use make GINAKIT cell . Once collect , white blood cell mixed special protein separate Natural Killer T cell white blood cell use special machine call CliniMACS Reagent System laboratory . This investigational device approve FDA . Although device approve use country , use year approve country . The investigator put new gene patient 's Natural Killer T cell mix retroviral vector ( special virus carry new gene cell ) contain new gene call iC9-GD2-CD28-OX40 . After new gene put Natural Killer T cell , cell test make sure kill GD2-positive neuroblastoma cell cell kill activation iC9 . The GINAKIT cell may give back patient fresh frozen . This dose escalation study . This mean beginning , patient start low dose ( 1 4 different level ) GINAKIT cell . Once dose schedule prove safe , next group patient start high dose . This process continue 4 dose level study . If side effect severe , dose lower infusion stop . Before get GINAKIT cell , patient receive cyclophosphamide fludarabine intraveneously 2 day fludarabine alone one day . Patients one day rest chemotherapy receive GINAKIT cell . The treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital . Patients need stay Houston 4 week infusion investigator monitor side effect . They follow-up visit ( week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ; month 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 ; twice year 4 year year next 10 year - total 15 year ) schedule disease evaluation GINAKIT cell infusion ( week 4 clinically need ) . Also , learn way GINAKIT cell work long last body , blood obtain chemotherapy , day GINAKIT cell infusion ( end infusion ) follow-up visit ( time point list ) . If patient experience significant side effect first GINAKIT cell infusion cancer remain stable responds , may offer additional dos cell dose future .</detailed_description>

Treatment Rapidly progressive disease Currently receive investigational drug History hypersensitivity murine protein contain product History cardiomegaly bilateral pulmonary infiltrates chest radiograph CT . However , patient cardiomegaly image may enrol assessment cardiac function ( i.e. , ECHO MUGA ) within 3 week start protocol therapy within normal limit . Additionally , patient bilateral pulmonary infiltrates image may enrol lesion consistent active neuroblastoma ( i.e. , negative functional imaging PET MIBG , pathologic assessment ) . Evidence tumor potentially cause airway obstruction Patients pregnant , lactating , unwilling use birth control Patients currently receive immunosuppressive drug corticosteroid ( Patients may receive treatment treated corticosteroid dose less 0.5mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent ) , tacrolimus cyclosporine . Patients previously experience severe toxicity cyclophosphamide fludarabine . All lab must collect within 10 day prior initiation study relate treatment ( except verification GD2 transduction )</criteria>
