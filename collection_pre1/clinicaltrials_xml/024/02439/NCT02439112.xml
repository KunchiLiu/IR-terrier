	<brief_title>Exercise Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Physical exercise haematological patient relevant complementary treatment , include patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) ( Jones 2013 ) . In hematological cancer , exercise feasible , safe beneficial numerous aspect ( aerobic capacity , muscle strength , quality life ( QOL ) , fatigue , psychosocial wellbeing , treatment-related symptom body composition , , stem cell transplantation ( Persoon 2013 ; Haren 2013 ) . Still evidence value exercise hematological disease sparse , general specific diagnosis ( Jones 2013 ; Fong 2014 ; Liu 2009 ) . Patients MM may differ hematological disease , poor functional status due skeletal related pain , affect QOL immune function , also return work risk disability pension , furthermore physical performance time physical active diminish throughout treatment course patient meet physical activity guideline ( Coleman 2004 ; Jones 2004 ; Craike 2013 ) . Hence , need examine effect exercise able give evidence base recommendation exercise MM patient . In Denmark , 320 patient diagnose MM annually . The median age diagnosis 68-71 year , incidence increase age . The prevalence increase due age population improve survival improvement medical treatment ( Kyle 2007 ; Sihori 2006 &amp; 2004 ; Alexander 2007 ; Kumar 2008 &amp; 2014 ) . Typically , patient present bone pain , anaemia , renal failure , recurrent infection , patient detect chance screen blood urine . Bone pain cause osteolytic destruction also may lead pathological fracture . When diagnosed , patient ( 80 % ) symptomatic disease need start treatment . The medical treatment MM two aim . Firstly , anti-myeloma systemic therapy aim reduce tumor burden prolong disease free survival , overall survival , secondly , supportive care aim prevent serious morbidity disease complication . Younger patient ( &lt; 65-70 year ) treat high dose chemotherapy stem cell support ( HDT ) . Elderly patient receive less intensive , yet still effective treatment include novel agent ( bortezomib , thalidomide ) . Painful bone lytic lesion may treat radiation therapy . Patients receive i.v . bisphosphonates reduce risk progressive bone disease fracture ( Rosen 2003 ; Morgan 2011 ) . Patients MM ( receive HDT ) perceive different symptom ( sleep mood disturbance , diminish functional performance , pain , shortness breath , distress , sadness difficulty pay attention . Symptoms interrelate vicious circle may present ( Coleman 2011 ; Anderson 2007 ) . Literature review : Exercise patient MM Only 3 RCT study ( Coleman 2003 &amp; 2008 &amp; 2012 ) 1 single arm pilot study ( Groeneveldt 2013 ) regard effect exercise patient MM identify . Coleman investigate patient undergo tandem autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation risk fracture , Groeneveldt investigate MM survivor . All exercise program individualize home-based , although one study also include weekly supervise training first three month monthly follow 3 month . The exercise program , compromise stretching , aerobic training strength resistance training , duration 6 month , 3 start induction HDT . The control advise walk 20 minute 3 time week . The single arm pilot study MM survivor show significant positive change QOL , fatigue muscle strength , aerobic fitness . Positive , although significant , change see regard anxiety/depression . In study Coleman et al . trend towards less decline aerobic capacity/physical performance exercise group compare control group . Lean body weight ( per month ) significantly increase among exercise compare control . Over 6 month period strength lean body weight increase perceive less fatigue , well mood night time sleep control . Trends physiologic benefit regard stem cell collection transfusion transplantation show . One Coleman study show statistical significant change treatment course ; decline physical performance , increase perceive fatigue , negative effect night sleep , exercise group control group . There statistical clinical significant difference investigate outcomes exercise group control group test time prior chemotherapy , 10-12 week later 15-16 week stem cell collection . The lack significant result due poor compliance ( base self-reported activity summary result report paper ) , structure supervision throughout exercise intervention perhaps inadequate intensity relation effect aerobic capacity . Moreover , Arkansas anti-myeloma Total Therapy Program highly intensive chemotherapy comparable induction regimen use Denmark . This highly intensive treatment may well counteract benefit physical training . However , noteworthy , exercise group well physical performance control group , although significant . Importantly , exercise program feasible , acceptable safe . The performed study different shortcoming , small study population , lack control group , lack supervise training , description whether assessor blind , inadequate description intervention . In summary , exercise find safe feasible patient MM induction HDT , discharge . There gap literature concern elderly patient MM general patient treat less intensive regimen HDT . The effect exercise physical function need examination , especially broad group patient MM also compromise elderly patient , make exercise even relevant complementary treatment early disease course order maintain physical function . Because nature disease involve bone , believe exercise may beneficial maintain MM patients´ regard physical function bone loss , old population ( Chin 2008 ) patient osteoporosis ( Hagen 2011 ; Howe 2011 ) find encouraging result regard bone health among cancer survivor ( Winters-Stone 2010 ) . The literature suggest combine train beneficial order maintain increase BMD lean body mass among patient prostate cancer breast cancer ( Bolam 2012 ; Cormie 2014 ) , among post menopausal woman ( Martyn-St James 2008 &amp; 2009 ; Palombaro 2006 ) among elderly ( Gómez-Cabello 2012 ) . Change bone marker effect exercise also investigate , although different exercise protocol . The result healthy woman men promise . Bone formation marker significantly increase , without significant change bone resorption marker ( Shibata 2003 ; Karabulut 2011 ) . OQL , disease specific perspective , need attention since exercise improve QOL ( Persoon 2013 ; Haren 2013 ; Mishra 2012 &amp; 2012 ) , since bone pain major problem patient MM , relevant investigate pain separate outcome . It demonstrate , breast cancer survivor meet physical activity guideline significant less likely report above-average pain breast cancer survivor meet physical activity guideline , always physically active report less pain inactive woman ( Forsythe 2013 ) . Griffith ( 2009 ) find , cancer patient report low pain level , become physically active ( adjusted age , cancer diagnosis , pretest pain , pretest physical activity/physical functioning ) , Forsythe ( 2013 ) demonstrate unchanged pain level despite increase physical activity . These result make even important investigate pain investigator set . Physical functioning impact level physical activity , importance long term perspective , investigator knowledge level physical activity investigate patient MM neither prospective design objective measurement . Recruitment All patient newly diagnose MM Roskilde Hospital Odense University Hospital screen eligibility basis inclusion exclusion criterion , first appointment physician ( hematologist ) time diagnosis . If eligible , physician briefly inform patient project , give write participation information . Before next consultation ( typically 2-3 day ) , investigator call patient information address question patient may regard project write informed consent obtained.If eligible patient want participate , patient register reason exclusion . Design After inclusion patient randomize 1:1 intervention group control group . The participant block randomize stratified treatment ( plan HDT versus ( vs. ) non-intensive treatment ) , performance status ( PFS 0-1 vs. PFS≥2 ) ( Oken 1982 ) , study site ( Roskilde vs. Odense ) . The intervention start day 8 ( 2nd week ) start treatment unless safety reason make necessary postpone start exercise . The measurement time point conduct experienced , educate investigator ( physiotherapist ) . Measurements preferably conduct physiotherapist site . Power calculation The number patient include determined power calculation , significance level , α = 0.05 80 % power , β = 0.20 minimum clinical difference mean ( SD ) 7 kg ( 13.1 ) knee extensor strength ( Groeneveldt 2013 ) , primary outcome ( correspond increase approximately 23 % ) . The number patient need , estimate 44 patient group ( intervention control ) . Statistical analysis It test whether data follow normal distribution.The follow description base assumption data normally distribute . For continuous data interval scale , mean ( sd ) use data ordinal scale , median ( range ) quartile use describe data . Differences within group test time group test time examine t-test . The significance level set p &lt; 0,05 . The analysis conduct accordance ITT . To test investigator hypothesis primary outcome ( knee extensor strength ) , t-test used standard error mean difference calculate . A mean difference 7 kg consider clinical significant , obtain H0 reject . To investigate association physical function physical activity , QOL , pain , lean body mass , BMD , bone marker , scatter plot use . If linear correlation exist , correlation coefficient calculate . The correlation test Fisher´s z transformation 95 % CI form .</detailed_description>
