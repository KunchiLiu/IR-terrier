	<detailed_description>PROBE repository standardize survey patient hemophilia group country , run annually , collect anonymized information quality life measure treatment modality . After develop tool phase 1 project , pilot feasibility study hereto describe . RATIONALE / GOAL Research base patient-centered data increasingly valued government private payer utilize public-policy decision part cost-benefit justification high-cost care treatment . A frequent question payer : Will additional investment ( sustain expand care ) improve life person hemophilia ? There significant need improve ability collect , collate , interpret relevant patient-centered data support implementation comprehensive care , home treatment preventative treatment regimen ( e.g. , prophylaxis ) . The PROBE study intend fill gap enhance direct patient-voice delivery care move advocacy effort sustain expand care beyond emotion argument ground evidence data . The overall inventory specific metric develop PROBE complement exist global comparative metric World Federation Hemophilia ( WFH ) provide WHF Global Survey ( e.g. , percent patient identify vs. expect within country , amount treatment product available within country per capita basis , ratio child adult survive adulthood ) . While WFH global metric value useful , provide complete direct insight patient fair within health care system . The exist WFH metric serve proxy measure impact care patient outcome within country . PROBE integrate knowledge translation component . This component manifest development validation inventory able recode experiential data contribute patient organization valid foundation evidence-based decision making ( e.g . within Health Technology Assessments [ HTAs ] ) . PROBE also useful raise awareness within community public impact treatment person live hemophilia ( PWH ) value effective prevention . GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE PROBE PROGRAM The focus PROBE investigate directly probe patient perspective outcomes deem relevant care . Through PROBE , investigator develop seek validate reliability , reproducibility responsiveness low-cost , easily administrable inventory collect patient self-reported outcome , burden experience live hemophilia . A preliminary instrument definition user test phase complete . This phase involve interactive workshop take-home project utilize economic concept patient report outcome ( PRO ) collection technique . The workshop conduct January 22-23 Barcelona , Spain . During workshop , participant partake exercise utilizing PROBE study draft questionnaire develop investigator provide feedback refinement prior finalization use pilot feasibility assessment . During workshop , PROBE investigation team seek participant insight questionnaire , propose inventory study methodology . The workshop also validate overall PROBE study goal well characterize viability patient organization simply collect self-reported PRO data directly PWH . During exercise , research protocol finalize , include inventory , metric questionnaire collection inventory data . Questionnaire translate local language explanatory material accompany questionnaire developed . The questionnaire develop base EQ-5D domain along abbreviate set supplemental question look various demographic , treatment option , impact hemophilia PWH 's life.The final questionnaire integrate EQ-5D-5L additional domain assess impact hemophilia PWH 's life ( e.g. , pain , independence , educational attainment , employment ) . The inventory domain , survey instrument , normative data / comparators select identified reflect customarily utilized coverage body ( e.g . government / private payer , HTAs Comparative Effectiveness Research ) . Where feasible , investigator incorporate generic instrument already widely accept public policy maker . In develop questionnaire , investigator also review available information question utilize publish research study data collection system ( e.g . ATHN , CDC , EHC , EUHASS , HERO , HUGS , WFH ) . CURRENT STUDY : PILOT FEASIBILITY STUDY This pilot feasibility study validate proof concept , assess reproducibility practicality develop inventory large-scale assessment patient-centered outcome PWH . The investigator expect able compare effect different treatment delivery modality regimens patient outcome . The investigator anticipate metric establish allow comparison patient outcomes within country time cross-sectionally country ( regionally globally ) , thus provide important new tool sustain promote additional health care investment . STUDY DESIGN Twelve country invite participate ( Australia , New Zealand , France , Hungary , Italy , Spain , The Netherlands , UK , Argentina , Brazil , Colombia , Venezuela ) . Each participate patient organization commit participate feasibility project . Six select base capacity assessment local infrastructure . The final questionnaire mail participant organization country , administer 2 group 50 subject country , three month apart . Questionnaire response return single independent site analysis , central data repository establish data analyst retain ( McMaster University ) . Demographic treatment relate information collect correlation analysis assess discriminatory property questionnaire component , include final tool ( inventory ) . Two moderate run inventory conduct country three month apart demonstrate reproducibility ( Approximately 600 PWH total - 50 PWH per sample exercise x six country x two test run per country ) . Both paper web version develop translation require . PWH recruit participation via patient organization contact database social medium portal . Reproducibility assess base analysis amount variability within across sample exercise country . Responsiveness assess base response rate percent complete response . Reliability demonstrate combined assessment measurement primary outcome ( e.g . response rate , complete response , agreement exercise , completion time , cost feasibility execution . ) ( See : Primary Outcome Variables / Measurement Of Results section ) . The data collect individual level , responses de-identified aggregated perform comparison outcomes population level rather allow comparison outcome individual patient level . Expected result The PROBE inventory ideally complement enhance utility WFH database , provide opportunity build country specific rich data set comparison patient-centered outcome provide critical data support advocacy effort improve morbidity , mortality overall quality life . Future application could include development WFH Global Survey style report every 2-3 year provide updated comparative data WFH training monograph support wider roll-out PROBE inventory National Member Organizations . Additionally , inventory could routinely conduct commence completion country development initiative ( e.g . WFH GAP ) implementation major health care reform impact PWH ( e.g . introduction prophylaxis home treatment ) monitor compare impact patient outcome . Once validate , PROBE establish mechanism make inventory widely available use within hemophilia community . However , specific mechanism make PROBE questionnaire relate methodology available yet establish . This may include system request prior consent use and/or develop mechanism collaborative study . STUDY POPULATION Each country permit determine target population take-home project . The PROBE Investigators provide guidance study population parameter , require . Patients recruit accord final inclusion criterion . No randomization require . There approximately 600 PWH total . The number PWH participate country project variable . As aspect PROBE study exercise well understand best practice obtain learning execution patient-centered research country number participant assess critical . This number PWH ( 600 ) assume 12 country participate project . Moderate / Severe PWH ( Age band limit may utilize narrow study population ) . Patients recruit accord final inclusion criterion . No randomization require . Two moderate large test run inventory conduct country three month apart demonstrate reproducibility ( Approximately 600 PWH total = 50 PWH per `` sample exercise '' x six country x two test run per country ) . PWH participate two test run may , would necessarily . When normative data available comparison general population , investigator consider strategy produce comparator ( e.g . survey non-effected sibling ) . They also explore suitable data chronic condition support aim study . Study result include assessment adequacy small sample size achieve reproducibility . The study design intend describe characteristic generally within overall study population test difference certain attribute subgroup . Inclusion Criteria - For phase , PWH recruit national hemophilia patient organization utilize exist membership roster , social medium outlet meeting / event . The investigator propose pre-determined method PWH recruitment . They utilize information gather workshop take-home project inform best practice recruitment methodology next step project . The investigator may consider request different country test different PWH recruitment strategy test reproducibility . Exclusion Criteria - Disease severity Age band age limit ( e.g . ≥ Age 18 ) may utilize narrow study population . During January 2015 meeting investigator inclusion / exclusion criterion finalize base feedback learn workshop . Disease severity base patient self-reported severity level . PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLES / MEASUREMENT OF RESULTS - Response rate ( number return questionnaires/number send ) - Percent complete response ( number answer question/number answerable question ) - Time completion ( self-reported completion time , median IQR ) - Administrative cost per complete survey ( human resource use dollar-equivalent spent run survey ) OTHER STUDY ELEMENTS - Protected Patient Information - Customary process implement protect individual patient identify . No identifiable patient information disclose part study . Data collect individual PWH level , responses de-identified aggregated perform comparison outcomes population level rather allow comparison outcome individual PWH level . Aggregate research result periodic project update provide sponsor . Raw data could attributable individual respondent provide . Independent management autonomy sponsor assure throughout project . - Adverse Event Reporting - Although anticipate PROBE Study Team would receive report adverse event within scope Study , Investigators make aware adverse event involve product manufacture study sponsor conduct study , Investigators commit notify sponsor within one ( 1 ) business day actually become aware significant product complaint , unexpected adverse event , governmental investigation inquiry involve sponsor 's product . - Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Approval - Given study design contemplate patient and/or patient organization directly collect data patient plan direct Clinician / Hemophilia Treatment Center patient data collection , investigator anticipate need require local patient organization obtain IRB approval . They aware global patient-to-patient study similar PROBE IRB approval require . Two primary outcome measure PROBE cost time completion Study . To achieve goal develop low-cost , easily administrable inventory , investigator strive design streamline easily deployable system minimal cost administrative burden . PROBE mindful local law practice may vary require investigator comply local practice similar type study . If course PROBE investigator determine protocol change sufficiently require IRB approval investigator . FUTURE STEPS The investigator expect PROBE use perform three comparison : among country , within country time , within country national normative data . The investigator preliminarily assess normative data available domain explore via exist instrument . When normative data available , investigator consider strategy produce comparator ( e.g . survey non-effected sibling ) . They also explore suitable data chronic condition support aim study . They conduct sensitivity analysis ass sufficiency inventory measure change impact care within population PWH overtime use data collect disease specific question PROBE questionnaire combination EQ-5D . After demonstrate feasibility , centralize data collection point establish . Initial data compilation clean database incorporate within web-platform development reporting agreement ( e.g .
