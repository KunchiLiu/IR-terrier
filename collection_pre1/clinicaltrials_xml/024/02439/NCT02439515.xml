	<brief_summary>The study propose novel rehabilitative program recovery locomotor abilities post-acute stroke patient . The hypothesis rehabilitative program involve biofeedback cycle train combine voluntary effort Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) leg muscle , biofeedback balance training superior usual care improve walk ability , disability , motor performance , independence post-acute stroke patient . The innovative approach investigate whether intervention directly involve locomotor function movement similar term kinematic pattern neural command ( e.g . pedal ) , aim recover essential prerequisite walking , postural control upright stance , may improve and/or accelerate recovery walk ability . A single-blind randomized control study carry . Participants post-acute stroke patient experience first stroke le 6 month recruitment , adult age , low level spasticity leg muscle ( Modified Ashworth scale &lt; 2 ) , limitation hip , knee , ankle joint , able sit 30 minute . Subjects randomize one two group , one performing novel rehabilitative program addition usual care ( experimental group ) , one perform usual care alone ( control group ) . The experimental program consist 15 session FES-supported voluntary cycling training follow 15 session balance training . Both cycle balance training support visual biofeedback order maximize patient ' involvement exercise perform addition usual care . The control group involve standard physical therapy include stretching , muscular conditioning , exercise trunk control , stand , walk training , upper limb rehabilitation . Both training program last 6 week patient train daily 90 minute . Cycling balance training last 20 minute ; thus , patient experimental group perform 70 minute usual care . Participants evaluate baseline ( T1 ) , end cycle train 3 week usual care ( post-treatment , T2 ) , end whole intervention ( post-treatment , T3 ) , 6 month end intervention ( follow-up , T4 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More detail experimental train program provide . The cycling training perform motorize cycle-ergometer ( MOTOmed , Reck GmbH ) equip force sensor mount base crank ( PowerForce system , Radlabor GmbH ) . The acquire force signal display subject ask achieve symmetrical involvement two leg . To deliver FES , current-controlled 8-channel stimulator ( RehaStim ; Hasomed GmbH ) use surface electrode apply bipolar configuration quadriceps , hamstring , gastrocnemius lateralis , tibialis anterior leg . Rectangular biphasic pulse pulse width 400 μs stimulation frequency 20 Hz adopt . The stimulus intensity set muscle first day training : paretic muscle value well tolerate subject able produce visibly good muscle contraction identify , whereas healthy side low value sensory threshold use . The stimulation time synchronize cycling movement accord physiological stereotyped activation pattern . The balance training perform upright stance use balance board ( Balance board basic™ , NeuroCom® International , Inc. ) . Subjects ask keep still move center pressure follow target display screen front .</detailed_description>
