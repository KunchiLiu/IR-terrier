	<brief_summary>Development myocardial reparative therapy treatment acute ischemic cardiac disease , base intracoronary administration allogeneic Cardiac Stem Cells ( CSCs ) ameliorate myocardial cell death promote cardio-regeneration . The study comprise two phase : 1 . Initial dose-escalation open-label safety phase comprise 6 patient . Escalation start Maximum Recommended Safe Dose ( MRSD ) calculate Non-Observed Adverse Events Level ( NOAEL ) expect finish target dose ( TD ) . There placebo group initial phase . 2 . Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled safety efficacy phase TD inject dose-escalation phase complete successfully .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Evaluation Intracoronary Infusion Allogeneic Human Cardiac Stem Cells Patients With AMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This `` First Patient '' Clinical Trial obtain safety efficacy result intracoronary administration suspension allogeneic cardiac stem cell ( CSCs ) treatment ST elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) . This clinical trial first dose-escalation phase safety 10 , 20 35 million CSCs administration evaluate 6 patient . A second double-blind randomize placebo control phase initiate , major safety effect observe first week cell administration . The 35 million cell dose one expect used randomized phase . Patients EF &lt; 45 % infarct size &gt; 25 % select magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) . 49 patient include randomized phase aim 38 patient efficacy analysis end follow period ( 12 month ) . In phase , patient randomly allocate receive CSCs placebo 2:1 scheme . Three bioequivalent cellular batch obtain different donor indistinctly use assay . CSCs placebo treatment infuse coronary artery responsible ischemic event . Placebo commercial preparation human serum albumin 5 % saline solution also use cell product reconstitution . After treatment , patient monitor overnight coronary care unit toxicity discharge hospital 24h treatment adverse event observe . Subsequent safety follow-up do first day 7 treatment monthly quarterly thereafter 12 month . In addition , efficacy evaluation perform MRI clinical parameter 1 , 6 12 month treatment . Finally , cellular humoral immunological response ( screen anti-HLA ( Human Leukocyte Antigen ) class I class II antibody , HLA typing , cross-matching cell treat patient cytokine profile blood sample ) analyse clinical trial .</detailed_description>
