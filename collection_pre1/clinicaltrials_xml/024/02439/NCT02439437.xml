	<brief_title>Targeted Pain Coping Skills Training ( PCST ) Prevention Treatment Persistent Post-Mastectomy Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent pain follow breast cancer surgery increasingly recognize important clinical public health issue due large number woman affect , negative impact persistent pain emotional physical functioning , financial cost . Most 230,000 woman expect newly diagnose breast cancer U.S. year undergo surgical treatment . Surgical removal affect breast ( mastectomy ) excision tumor ( lumpectomy ) follow radiation markedly reduce risk disease progression mortality . However , woman undergo even limited lumpectomy substantial risk persistent pain . Estimates pain 's prevalence range 25-60 % across multiple study , rate differ base stringency definition persistent pain . In one recent study , 32.5 % woman undergone breast cancer surgery report clinically significant persistent pain , define 3/10-pain severity rating breast , axilla , side , arm . Unlike acute post-operative pain , consider normal response surgical trauma , persistent pain little biological utility proven difficult treat establish . A critical question whether modifiable factor contribute risk develop persistent pain follow breast cancer surgery could target early , preventative intervention . To date , attempt reduce risk persistent pain focus alteration medical/surgical procedure ; study mix result , consistent mixed finding broad literature regard status medical/surgical variable risk factor persistent pain . In contrast , multiple study show association pain catastrophizing , depression , anxiety persistent pain . In study , pain catastrophizing show strong consistent relationship persistent pain evidence recent meta-analysis . Consistent biopsychosocial theory pain , also evidence quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) study alterations central pain modulation pathway contribute development post-surgical persistent pain , include recent study breast cancer patient . Since pain catastrophizing find associate pernicious alteration central pain modulation intervene reduce catastrophizing may particularly effective prevention strategy persistent pain follow breast cancer surgery . Pain cop skill train ( PCST ) intervention base cognitive-behavioral principle intervention demonstrate reduce catastrophizing , alter central modulation pain reduce chronic pain . The overarch hypothesis propose pilot study ( N=60 ) target PCST protocol specifically design woman risk persistent pain follow breast cancer surgery ( pain score 3 great [ 0-10 scale ] first month post-surgery ) ( 3-5 ) significantly reduce devastate consequence treatment compare usual care print education material . Aim 1 : To use pilot RCT ( N=60 ) examine feasibility , acceptability , engagement target PCST protocol . Feasibility assess examine overall accrual , attrition , adherence study protocol , engagement assess use intervention session questionnaire ( number complete ) , acceptability assess standardized measure satisfaction . Aim 2 : To obtain estimate effect size target PCST protocol persistent post-surgical pain comparison usual care condition . Effect size group difference pain burden , symptom anxiety depression , breast cancer specific distress , perceive stress , sleep , interference daily activity , pain catastrophizing , hypothesize change peripheral sensitivity central inhibition also compute . The propose study represent next critical step research examine persistent pain surgical treatment breast cancer . The propose study provide necessary preliminary data large study aim test target PCST intervention . This study also provide preliminary data future study focus pain sensitivity central pain modulation breast cancer survivor</detailed_description>
