	<brief_summary>The FDA Health Canada approve regorafenib daily dose 160mg treatment metastatic colorectal cancer gastrointestinal stromal cancer ; however , 160 mg dose well tolerated patient , especially woman . The purpose study determine lean body mass acidity intestinal tract impact regorafenib absorb bloodstream broken remove body . This may explain side effect experience 160 mg dose , especially woman , inform regorafenib dose future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Numerous investigator note recommended flat dose regorafenib 160 mg orally , daily well tolerated patient , especially woman . The purpose study determine correlation lean body mass regorafenib pharmacokinetics , may possible exploit relationship well dose regorafenib . Additionally , Bayer note regorafenib steady state level low gastrointestinal stromal tumour ( GIST ) patient patient metastatic colorectal cancer . GIST patient often gastrectomy would lead elevated pH intestinal tract . If regorafenib pH dependent solubility lower regorafenib level could due reduce acidity . The purpose second part study examine regorafenib pharmacokinetic profile patient treat proton pump inhibitor ( pantoprazole ) 7 day , mimic alter intestinal environment see GIST patient .</detailed_description>
