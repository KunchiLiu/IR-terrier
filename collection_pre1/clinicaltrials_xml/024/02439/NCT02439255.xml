	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study effect black raspberry compound ( phytochemical ) bacteria mouth ( oral microbiome ) current smoker non-smokers . The oral microbiome protects body pathogenic bacteria . Smoking alters oral microbiome may increase susceptibility cancer modulate normal host-bacteria interaction . Black raspberry phytochemical may protect oral microbiome smoker may lower risk develop oral cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect black raspberry phytochemical community dynamic within oral biofilms . II . Examine effect oral bacterial community metabolism black raspberry phytochemical current never smoker . III . Evaluate efficacy black raspberry phytochemical metabolites reverse effect smoke oral host-microbial interaction . OUTLINE : Participants randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Participants receive bioactivity black raspberry phytochemical-rich delivery vehicle ( BRB nectar ) orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 12 week . ARM II : Participants receive placebo nectar PO QD 12 week .</detailed_description>
