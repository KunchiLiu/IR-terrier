	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call idelalisib ( formerly know GS-1101 CAL-101 ) possible treatment Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia ( WM ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) Inhibitor Idelalisib ( GS-1101 ) Waldenström Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational drug , idelalisib , learn whether idelalisib work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean idelalisib still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , idelalisib effective treat different type cancer . Idelalisib already approve US FDA treat patient relapse chronic lymphocytic leukemia , follicular lymphoma small lymphocytic lymphoma . Idelalisib newly discover drug develop anti-cancer agent . This drug use laboratory experiment research study B-cell malignancy information research study suggest idelalisib may help target tumor cell B-cell malignancy , include WM . B cell type white blood cell responsible make antibody . In research study , investigator test safety efficacy idelalisib treatment option relapse refractory Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia .</detailed_description>
