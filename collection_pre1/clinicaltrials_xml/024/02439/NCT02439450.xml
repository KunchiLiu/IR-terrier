	<brief_summary>This study test whether vaccination viagenpumatucel-L combined strategy modulate immune response safe patient non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma fail least one prior line therapy incurable metastatic disease . These method collectively use body 's immune system target patient 's tumor . Immunosuppression hinders response , may develop NSCLC patient variety way , activation checkpoint pathway tumor microenvironment . Drugs disrupt checkpoint molecule signal like anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab , may release brake immune system . Tumor expression PD-L1 play important role patient response checkpoint inhibitor ; general , clinical response checkpoint inhibitor require tumor expression PD-L1 presence Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes ( TIL ) . Combining viagenpumatucel-L anti-PD-1 agent may enhance vaccine 's anti-tumor activity prolong increase efficacy checkpoint inhibitor .</brief_summary>
