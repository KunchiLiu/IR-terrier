	<brief_summary>Kinshasa , Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) appear diversified . The factor lead jumpstart HIV-1 epidemic remain unclear ; mount evidence suggest medical intervention may contribute . Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) viruses compatible long-term survival broadly similar mode transmission HIV . The main objective ass association past intravenous treatment HCV HTLV-1 seropositivity . The investigator hypothesize medical intervention mid-20th century may facilitate emergence HIV-1 central Africa . To assess association injectable treatment HCV HTLV-1 infection reconstruct past virus dynamic , investigator conduct cross-sectional study 839 elderly long-term inhabitant Kinshasa , serological assay follow amplification sequencing .

	<detailed_description>1 . Background 1.1 The emergence HIV The HIV/AIDS pandemic far cause 29 million death , 33 million individual currently live HIV . Even direct impact future course epidemic , important try understand factor allow successful emergence HIV-1 , first moral obligation towards victim , draw lesson could ultimately help mankind avoid face similar threat future . There doubt source HIV-1 group M ( strain cause pandemic ) Pan troglodytes troglodyte chimpanzee central Africa . This primate inhabit south Cameroon , Gabon , Equatorial Guinea , Congo Republic , south-west Central African Republic ( CAR ) , Cabinda enclave small part Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) ( Mayombe area north river ) . It think original cross-species transmission , chimpanzee man , occur around begin 20th century , probably manipulation chimpanzee meat hunter cook , common ancestor group M exist human around 1910-1920 . It extremely unlikely first infect human live DRC , population Pan troglodytes troglodyte small . The virus slowly disseminate along trading route , eventually reach Léopoldville Brazzaville later 1959 . It large bi-national conurbation virus manage flourish diversify , support several finding : 1 . The broad genetic diversity HIV-1 find Kinshasa Brazzaville . All HIV-1 subtypes many recombinant find . Indeed , genetic diversity HIV-1 Kinshasa mid-1980s , twenty-five year ago , high currently find part world . 2 . The two ancient isolates HIV-1 locate Kinshasa , one blood sample obtain 1959 second lymph node biopsy obtain 1960 . 3 . Testing serum collection store year show among mother bring child under-five clinic Lemba district Kinshasa , HIV prevalence 0.25 % 1970 3.0 % 1980 . 4 . HIV prevalence among general adult population Kinshasa Brazzaville mid-1980s already 5 8 % , far low Yaoundé , Douala Libreville , large city central Africa . 5 . Several serologically proven case AIDS diagnose retrospectively among Belgian national probably infect Congo 1960s . The question remain understand factor facilitate emergence HIV-1 within population middle 20th century ( elsewhere ) . For long time , attribute essentially urbanisation central Africa . The colonialist create city adult men far outnumber woman , lead development urban prostitution , eventually HIV-1 encounter condition propitious sexual spread , initially among prostitute client , along line later document Nairobi 1980s . It indeed likely prostitution ultimately play substantial role emergence HIV-1 Kinshasa/Brazzaville . However , long period time , prostitution two city rather `` soft '' , low-risk , type : free woman ( ndumbas ) 3-4 regular client , provide sex diversified service ( cook , laundry , hair dressing , conversation ) exchange regular financial support rather fix fee per intercourse . High-risk prostitution , woman could sex 3-4 different client every day , thousand per year , appear circa 1960 , around new venue call flamingos , bar rudimentary room nearby , context profound social economic change prompt country 's accession independence . For several year investigate possibility early expansion HIV occur well-intentioned medical intervention . For long time , early pharmaceutical product poorly effective , drug treatment tropical infectious disease administer intravenously , syrinx needle continuously re-utilised poorly sterilize , potentially allow transmission blood-borne virus . This risk could appreciate time , initially existence virus unknown , also acute infection Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) generally cause mild non-specific disease , adult already infect Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) childhood , immune time receive treatment tropical disease . In Egypt , million infect HCV intervention control schistosomiasis , demonstrate iatrogenic epidemic indeed reach massive scale . In community-based study elderly individual Guinea-Bissau , show HIV-2 epidemic might also largely iatrogenic , treatment African trypanosomiasis parenteral treatment tuberculosis intramuscular streptomycin ( augmented transmission ritual excision clitoris collective ceremony ) , contribute emergence simian-turned-human retrovirus 40 50 year ago . This latter study possible HIV-2 increase mortality 2 3-fold , contrast HIV-1 enhances mortality 10-fold . We hypothesize medical intervention , others base mass administration parenteral drug , may also facilitate , roughly time , emergence HIV-1 central Africa . Because high mortality associate HIV-1 infection , possible examine hypothesis directly . However , HCV HTLV-1 ( virus compatible prolonged survival ) infection use marker parenteral transmission virus , determine indirectly whether intervention may contribute emergence HIV-1 . We conduct two epidemiological study elderly individual ( age 55-60 year ) central Africa . In Ebolowa , south Cameroon , half elderly HCV-seropositive , HCV seropositivity associate mainly intravenous treatment malaria quinine , also traditional circumcision boy group ceremony . In Nola region southwest CAR , HCV seropositivity associate treatment African trypanosomiasis 1950 , HTLV-1 infection associate prophylactic injection pentamidine ( prevention trypanosomiasis , 1947 1953 ) transfusion . In context , would relevant try assess whether parenteral transmission might play role emergence HIV-1 Kinshasa half century ago , use two proxy , HCV HTLV-1 infection . 1.2 Hepatitis C virus infection central Africa Africa continent high HCV prevalence among adult population . In central Africa , 6 % adults HCV-seropositive , compare 2.4 % West Africa 1.6 % eastern southern Africa3 . In many area central Africa , HCV prevalence increase steeply age , far beyond could expect cumulative exposure time . Since modest heterosexual vertical transmission HCV , generally think transmission occur parenterally , injection , transfusion , immunization scarifications . It known parenteral transmission HCV rather ineffective unless needle first insert vein viremic individual . This mechanism drive massive epidemic Egypt , large number individual infect early 1960s campaign control schistosomiasis intravenous injection antimonial drug . In sub-Saharan Africa , Cameroon country epidemiology HCV thoroughly investigate . Several study document high HCV prevalence , Yaoundé also many rural southern community . A synthesis study demonstrate cohort effect : many area , HCV prevalence 40-50 % amongst individual born 1945 , progressively decrease 15 % bear around 1960 3-4 % born 1970 . In several Cameroonian study , HCV prevalence peak cohort correspond date birth around 1935 . Furthermore , molecular clock analysis reveal number Cameroonians infected HCV start increase exponentially around 1920 genotype 4 , around 1940 genotype 1 2 . Since mode transmission rather ineffective , implies massive iatrogenic transmission virus last decade colonial era . As mention , one high-prevalence community , administration intravenous antimalarial main risk factor HCV infection . It follow HCV blood-borne virus massively transmit medical intervention several area inhabit Pan troglodytes troglodyte chimpanzee , amplification might occur SIVcpz eventually become HIV-1 . In DRC , HCV prevalence measure one study . Among Kinshasa sex worker , HCV prevalence increase age reach 21 % age 41-55 year . As sexual transmission HCV rather ineffective , prevalence must reflect extent prevalence general adult population . Among pregnant woman age 31-55 year , HCV prevalence 5.6 % one presume age 40 year . 2 . Objectives Our hypothesis intravenous treatment various infectious disease poorly sterilize syrinx needle contribute transmission HCV HTLV-1 within city Kinshasa middle 20th century , could well facilitate early emergence HIV-1 . The objective study : 1. determine whether HCV seropositivity ( primary outcome ) associate past intravenous treatment tropical disease , especially pre-1980 period . 2. reconstruct past dynamic HCV Kinshasa molecular clock method base sequence local HCV isolates obtain elderly individual determine period maximal transmission blood-borne virus occur . 3. determine whether medical intervention associate transmission HTLV-1 ( secondary outcome ) . 4. contribute good understand epidemiology HCV HTLV-1 infection DRC .</detailed_description>
