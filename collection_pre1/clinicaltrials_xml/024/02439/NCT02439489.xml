	<brief_title>Study Combination BKM120 Cisplatin Carboplatin Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite recent progress antineoplastic therapy durable cancer remission still infrequent many solid tumor new treatment option need patient whose cancer progress follow standard therapy . There increase interest evaluate new combination cytotoxics new molecule target agent could increase antitumor activity . PI3K signal hallmark many cancer . Subsets cancer become dependent PI3K pathway signal result mutation PIK3CA gene regulator PI3K ( e.g . PTEN , HER2 ) . As consequence , pathway mutated tumor particularly sensitive towards PI3K-pathway inhibition . BKM120 potent highly specific oral pan-class I PI3K-inhibThe study FM-11-F01b phase Ib single institution study use combination BKM120 cisplatin carboplatin patient pathologically confirm recurrent metastatic advance solid tumor , treatment platinum agent indicate ( preferentially head neck , NSCLC , ovary , endometrial ) . itor . The study treatment foreseen BKM120 administer continuous daily dose schedule dose 60 , 80 100 mg ( p.o . ) plus Carboplatin Cisplatin . Cisplatin 75 mg/mq administer 2 hour intravenous infusion every 3 week . Carboplatin AUC 5 ( AUC 6 dose level 3 complete ) administer 30 minute intravenous infusion dilute 250 mL normal saline every 3 week . This single institution phase I study . Up 3 dose level daily BMK120 study . A standard 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation design use Group 1 Group 2 . Dose escalation Group 1 Group 2 mutually independent . The primary objective study define phase II recommend dose daily oral BKM120 cisplatin ( Group 1 ) carboplatin ( Group 2 ) , give intravenously ( IV ) day 1 every 3 week . BKM120 carboplatin cisplatin .</detailed_description>
