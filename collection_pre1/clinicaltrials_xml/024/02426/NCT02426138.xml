	<brief_summary>Food insecurity , define difficulty access food owe cost , affect 1 5 diabetes patient . To address , investigator conduct pilot randomize control trial medically tailor meal delivery ( MTM ) . The pilot study two specific aim : Aim 1 : To determine effect receive MTM dietary quality food insecure diabetes patient hyperglycemia Aim 2 : To determine feasibility acceptability program medical intervention refine program need test large study . This study crossover randomize control pilot trial , approximately 50 participant , 25 arm , randomize receipt 12 week MTM , begin immediately , waitlist control . After 12 week , group crossover , waitlist control group receive 12 week MTM . At baseline , 12 week , 24 week , participant complete assessment dietary quality ( HEI score ) , psychosocial measure diabetes distress food insecurity , along measure body mass index , blood pressure , hemoglobin A1c , lipid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>. Historical background The Center Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) estimate currently 29 million people diabetes 86 million people pre-diabetes U.S. One 10 Americans diabetes , , current trend continue , 1 3 Americans diabetes 2050 . This chronic disease significantly impact quality life rapidly rise national healthcare cost . The estimated cost diabetes U.S. 2014 $ 265 billion $ 176 billion direct medical cost $ 89 billion indirect medical cost ( disability , work loss , premature mortality ) . Medical expense people diabetes 2.3 time high people without diabetes . Food insecurity , define limited access nutritious food due cost , associate increase prevalence diabetes worse diabetes control . Food insecurity may worsen diabetes decrease consumption fresh fruit vegetable increase consumption inexpensive , calorie-dense food , turn lead great Hemoglobin A1c , indicator hyperglycemia , time . c. Rationale behind propose research , potential benefit participant and/or society Approximately 20 % diabetes patient report food insecurity , number increase 25 % among bad metabolic control.5 The prevalence food insecurity also 20 % MGH Population survey ( data yet publish ) . Hyperglycemia particularly responsive dietary changes,8 yet intervention attempt address food insecurity diabetes care . Prior study examine impact Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP , formerly Food Stamp Program ) , find important improvement diabetes outcome participants9 . This may neighborhood access produce high quality food low many SNAP participant , make healthy food choice difficult resource-constrained environment . Additionally , recent sociological work show expect low-income woman cook healthy meal family induces significant burden , burden expectation may drive less healthy food choice . Additionally , significant time need healthy food preparation , low-income patient often face limited leisure time , multiple compete demand time financial resource . Alternatively , direct provision healthy food incidentally note improve diabetes outcomes prior randomize control trial , study conduct goal address food insecurity . In study , propose test whether home delivery freshly prepared meal specifically tailor need diabetes patient improve dietary quality . We hypothesize delivery meal help eat healthily improve food security participant . Secondary outcome pilot study weight metabolic control , along psychological aspect diabetes care . Aim 1 : To evaluate effectiveness receive Community Servings meal dietary quality food insecure diabetes patient severe hyperglycemia ( HbA1c &gt; 8.0 % ) H1 . Primary outcome . Healthy Eating Index 2010 ( HEI ) score : We hypothesize CS group demonstrate great improvement dietary quality , assess HEI score , 12 week , compare usual care . The sample size 50 provide 80 % power detect 5 point difference CS usual care group , assume 11 point standard deviation account 10 % drop-out rate . H1b . Secondary exploratory outcome . Medical outcome : We hypothesize compare usual care , CS group participant improve HbA1c , blood pressure , weight , lipid baseline end intervention . H1c . Behavioral psychosocial outcome : Because meal provision reduce stress relate procure healthy meal , free household resource would otherwise spent food , hypothesize compare usual care , CS group great improvement baseline patient-reported outcome diabetes distress material need security . Aim 2 : To evaluate feasibility provide meal patient experience CS program , particularly focus factor determine acceptability , continuation , scalability We use mixed method approach use participant structure interview survey assess engagement satisfaction program , participant interview focus group compare responder non-responders . We also collect quantitative indicator feasibility implementation percent meal deliver consume , enrollment persistence program , logistical issue order plan future full-scale intervention .</detailed_description>
