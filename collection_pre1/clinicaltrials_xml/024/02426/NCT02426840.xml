	<brief_summary>Since cure HIV , therefore antiretroviral therapy must take life-long . Some HIV medication negatively impact health bone even exacerbate perinatally HIV-injected child adolescent period bone peak . Bone loss period devastate increase risk develop weak bone later life . Supplementation calcium vitamin D well study HIV-infected child adolescent develop country . Therefore clear whether high dos supplementation thwart damage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcium High-dose Vitamin D Supplementation Bone Mineral Density Among HIV-infected Children Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adverse bone health one major long-term complication among perinatally HIV-infected child adolescent receive ART . Since great deal bone mineral accrual occur adolescent year peak attainment usually see age 18 year , loss bone deposition period could lead serious consequence , particularly increase risk osteoporosis bone fragility later life . A previous study demonstrate prevalence low BMD among perinatally HIV-infected Thai child adolescent high ( 25 % ) . However , prevention strategy calcium vitamin D supplementation widely recommend many guideline prevent osteoporosis bone fracture well study prove effectiveness among HIV-infected child adolescent , especially resource-limited country . This consider critical research question pediatric HIV/AIDS field urgently require robust in-depth investigation . This randomized clinical trial study provide important information effect calcium high dose ( compare normal dose ) vitamin D supplementation BMD among ART-experienced , perinatally acquire HIV-infected child adolescents best understand relative contribution supplementation improve bone health status . This study address research question , fill gap knowledge , draw clinician attention important long-term medical complication child adolescent grow HIV . Moreover , study inform healthcare provider policy maker importance calcium vitamin D supplementation one measurement prevent long-term deterioration bone mass mean promote bone health among population . The funding study National Research University , Chiang Mai University .</detailed_description>
