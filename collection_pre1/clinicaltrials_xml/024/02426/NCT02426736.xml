	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND &amp; RATIONALE Interscalene brachial plexus blockade ( ISB ) emerge choice method analgesia arthroscopic shoulder surgery perform outpatient basis . The ISB typically administer single injection local anesthetic prior surgery . Benefits include reduce pain , opioid consumption postoperative nausea vomit first postoperative day . However , limited duration analgesia single injection local anesthetic , typically 12 to15 hour , inadequate many patient . Recent interest prolong analgesic duration single injection ISB focus addition various adjunct local anesthetic , vary degree success . Dexamethasone promising adjunct , perineural intravenous administration consistently result increase analgesic duration , much two-fold . Nevertheless , would seem prudent administer perineural adjunct lowest effective dose offer significant benefit route administration . The multiple small clinical study publish date use dexamethasone dose 4 10mg intravenous perineural route . Attributing difference result study dose route dexamethasone administer possible due difference drug , dos , study population methodology . Most importantly , study compare two different dos dexamethasone two study compare intravenous perineural route arrive different conclusion . Thus , effect dexamethasone dose route analgesic duration interscalene block remain unclear , multiple recent editorial meta-analyses call study . In light gap evidence , trial elucidate effect dose route administration dexamethasone analgesic duration ISB require . This focus propose study . OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES In factorial design study outpatient undergo elective arthroscopic shoulder surgery interscalene brachial plexus block ( ISB ) , investigator compare perineural intravenous administration dexamethasone high ( 8mg ) low ( 4mg ) dos . The investigator hypothesize high dos perineural route provide significantly long duration analgesia , without significant statistical interaction dose route administration . METHODS This single-centre , factorial design , double-blinded , randomize control superiority trial four parallel group 1:1:1:1 randomization . Consenting eligible adult ambulatory patient undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery receive preoperative , ultrasound guide ISB 30 millilitre ( mL ) 0.5 % bupivacaine 4mg 8mg preservative free dexamethasone either intravenous perineural . The remainder intraoperative postoperative care discretion attend anesthesiologist surgeon . Based previous work , 70 patient per group , study least 90 % power detect 3 hour difference analgesia dose route , 4 hour synergistic interaction , even 5 % attrition rate . Outcomes assessed chart review telephone follow postoperative day one , postoperative day 2 ( necessary ) , postoperative day 14 . An interim analysis group standard deviation occur 100 patient complete study determine original power calculation accurate , test interaction effect feasible within planned sample size 280 participant . If test interaction dose route feasible , new study sample size determine , base number participant need 90 % power test two main effect . The primary outcome analysis analyze intention treat patient randomize receive attempt interscalene block . A secondary analysis exclude patient `` fail '' inter scalene block post anesthesia care unit . A tertiary analysis multivariable analysis adjust demographic , preoperative naproxen use , use general anesthesia , cumulative analgesic use fail inter scalene block .</detailed_description>
