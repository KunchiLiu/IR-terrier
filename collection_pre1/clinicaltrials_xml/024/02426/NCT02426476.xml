	<brief_summary>Pain initiate stress response increase sympathetic output lead autonomic imbalance . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) easy perform , valid measure autonomic function . HRV biofeedback ( HRV-B ) novel biobehavioral procedure patient learn restore autonomic balance develop 'HRV Coherence ' . Patients HRV Coherence improve mood cognition . The investigator ' pilot study show HRV-B alleviate chronic pain stress among Veteran Pain Clinic patient . HRV-B thus pivotal role manage pain . The propose project randomize , sham-controlled , biobehavioral intervention HRV-B test hypotheses HRV-B increase HRV coherence reduces pain , stress , fatigue , insomnia depression improve sleep , activity , cognition Veterans chronic neuromuscular pain . The investigator hypothesize HRV-B ( 1 ) reduce self-reported pain stress rating , ( 2 ) improve objective measure actigraphic sleep parameter ( sleep latency , duration , efficiency , fragmentation ) , rest/activity rhythm ( dichotomy index , interdaily stability ) cognitive function ( reaction time , attention ) ; ( 3 ) alleviate self-reported fatigue depression symptom . Patients two group randomize investigator ' previously establish HRV-B sham protocol ( n=40 ) , complete baseline assessment , 6 weekly training session , post-training assessment , 4-week 8-week follow-up evaluation post-training . Portable , hand-held , data-logging device use practice attain HRV coherence home active HRV-B training group , sham train group get 'stress squeeze ball ' . Standard method quantify HRV coherence HRV measure , validate instrument use assess pain , stress , fatigue , insomnia , depression , cognitive function . Wrist actigraphy use objectively characterize insomnia via continuous recording collect 24-hrs/day three 1-week period ( pre-training , post-training , 4 week follow-up assessment . Tests measure attention reaction time assess change cognitive performance . Data analyse apply linear model repeat measure evaluate effect HRV-B study outcome , treatment persistence , adjust confound factor . This study first examine HRV-B pain management among Veteran chronic pain patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study fulfill national Veterans Health Administration/Department Defense ( VHA/DoD ) Task Force recommendation complementary , integrative therapy pain management provide Veterans . Chronic pain elicits stress increase sympathetic output foster autonomic nervous system imbalance , overextend stress response , fatigue , depression insomnia . Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) measure interplay sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system , thus useful easily-measured index autonomic balance relationship chronic pain effect . HRV biofeedback ( HRV-B ) novel , biobehavioral procedure restore normal autonomic balance . Through HRV-B , patient increase parasympathetic cardiac output restore autonomic balance via induction 'HRV coherence ' . The investigator ' pilot study indicate HRV-B produce coherence alleviate self-reported rating chronic pain stress among Veterans attend investigator ' Pain Clinic . The proposed clinical intervention test hypotheses HRV-B increase HRV coherence , reduce self-reported pain , stress , depression , fatigue , insomnia , improve cognition among Veterans chronic pain . The specific aim : ( 1 ) conduct randomize , sham-controlled , pilot intervention trial determine whether HRV-B increase HRV coherence among chronic pain patient ( n=40 HRV-B sham treatment group ; total N=80 patient ) ; ( 2 ) determine whether HRV-B reduces self-reported pain stress among chronic pain patient . The primary endpoint include HRV coherence , pain ( Brief Pain Inventory BPI ) , stress ( Perceived Stress Scale PSS ) Outcomes measure 4 time point . pre-training ; post-training , one week 6 weekly treatment ; 4 week follow-up post-training , 8-week post-training follow-up ( total time participation 16 week pre-training 8 week follow-up ) . Furthermore , chronic stress associate disrupted circadian rest/activity rhythm domains quality life ( QoL ) include fatigue , insomnia , reduce physical social functioning . Interventions relieve pain thus represent novel therapeutic target normalize dysfunctional rest/activity rhythm QoL domains among pain patient . The investigator also interested assess effect HRV-B cognitive function pain patient . Thus , investigator ' secondary exploratory objective determine HRV-B : ( 1 ) improve sleep rest/activity rhythm ; ( 2 ) alleviate self-reported fatigue depression ; ( 3 ) improves cognitive function ( reaction time , attention ) . Circadian endpoint measure actigraphic parameter sleep ( e.g. , duration , efficiency ) , rest/activity ( e.g. , dichotomy index , interdaily stability ) , Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire ( ISQ ) ; fatigue assess use Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory ( MFI ) , assess general physical mental fatigue motivation . Depression assess via Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ) . Cognitive function measure cognitive battery comprise Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ( PASAT ) , Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( RAVLT ) , Psychomotor Vigilance Test ( PVT ) . Proposed Intervention . HRV-B training follow previously establish , standardize protocol . The primary ( HRV coherence , pain , stress ) exploratory outcome ( insomnia , fatigue , depression , cognition ) . Outcomes assess 4 time point : pre-training ; post-training , one week 6 weekly treatment ; 4 week follow-up post-training , 8-week post-training follow-up ( total time participation 16 week pre-training 8 week follow-up ) . There HRV-B training 8 week follow-up , assessment . Standardized procedure characterize HRV coherence frequency- time-domain HRV measure , validate instrument use assess pain stress . Wrist actigraphy characterize insomnia via continuous , 24-hour/day personal monitoring rest/activity rhythms 1-week interval coincide baseline pre-training ( baseline ) , post-training , 8-week follow-up assessment . The investigator provide portable data-logging device practice HRV-B home . Sham intervention subject pulse respiration monitor receive active training ; instead view static , relaxing nature picture computer screen . The investigator use Hochberg procedure12 control false discovery rate 5 % . Analyses base intent treat two-sided test . The effect HRV-B coherence HRV variable analyze use linear mixed model repeat measure data sequential time assessment , between-subjects factor evaluate intervention adjust potential confounding factor ( e.g. , age , standard therapy , medication , co-morbid disease ) . Baseline relationships HRV endpoint examine use multiple regression model . Few study examine multivariate relationship pain , autonomic dysfunction , stress , depression , sleep , rest/activity rhythm , fatigue , cognition .</detailed_description>
