	<brief_title>Once Daily Dosing Improve Medication Adherence Patient Satisfaction Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current pilot study first demonstrate safety feasibility convert maintenance transplant recipient daily regimen , measure patient satisfaction adherence secondary outcome . The purpose study determine safety feasibility convert maintenance kidney transplant recipient ( i.e . one year post transplantation ) daily drug regimen ( include immunosuppressant non-immunosuppressant drug ) . We believe conversion daily ( O.D . ) medication regimen immunosuppressive non-immunosuppressive medication associate increased patient adherence satisfaction . Immunosuppressant non-adherence consider lead potentially avoidable cause allograft failure , non-adherent patient seven fold high odds graft failure adherent patient . Although medication non-adherence multi-factorial , simplification medication requirement associate improved adherence non-transplant setting . There prospective study examine strategy improve immunosuppressant adherence . The propose study significant potential improve medication adherence satisfaction kidney transplant recipient may ultimately lead improvement long-term outcome . The major barrier establish daily medication regimen maintenance kidney transplant recipient ( i.e . patient ≥ 12 month post transplantation ) relate requirement prescribe calcineurin inhibitor twice daily . The development Advagraf ( tacrolimus extend release capsule ) , approve prevention rejection kidney transplant recipient , provide opportunity convert patient daily immunosuppressant medication regimen . The maintenance immunosuppressant medication use kidney transplantation Myophenolic acid ( MPA ) , azathioprine prednisone . Myophenolic acid ( MPA ) first make available use kidney transplantation 1995 form prodrug mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) ; later follow introduction mycophenolate sodium ( Myfortic ) . The recommend dose MMF Myfortic 2g/day 1440 mg/day respectively de novo transplant recipient . In clinical practice , maintenance patient ( i.e . 1 year post transplantation ) often maintain recommend initial ( see ) . In study involve patient prescribe recommended initial daily dose , MPA exposure highly variable : The 12 hour area curve ( AUC ) range anywhere 15 115 mg*h/L . In first post transplant year , 12 hour AUC 30 -60 mg*h/l recommend base study show increased incidence rejection AUC &lt; 30 mg*h/l , additional efficacy benefit AUC &gt; 60 mg*h/l cyclosporine treat patient . A relationship MPA exposure acute rejection beyond 3 month demonstrate . There paucity study examine concentration-effect relationship beyond first post transplant year thus establish recommendation MPA exposure first post-transplant year . In clinical practice significant proportion long-term ( ≥ 1 year post transplant ) MPA treat patient prescribe less recommended dose MPA due variety reason include patient intolerance ( usually gastrointestinal hematological ) . Most reduction MPA dose undertaken first month transplantation renal allograft dysfunction hypoalbuminemia may increase free MPA exposure possibly increase drug relate side effect . Importantly recent controlled study de novo maintenance transplant patient demonstrate safety daily MPA dose use less initial recommend daily dose . Prednisone may may prescribe maintenance transplant recipient . Maintenance prednisone dose varies 5 -10 mg daily every day . Azathioprine establish daily medication . A significant criticism one daily immunosuppressant regimens patient still require take medication multiple time per day . Uniquely propose study convert medication ( immunosuppressant non-immunosuppressants ) daily regimen . In summary , advance immunosuppressant drug make possible consider daily immunosuppressant regimen maintenance kidney transplant recipient . Eligible patient screen consented hospital study team . The conversion daily dose regimen accomplish three phase : 1 ) conversion Advagraf ; 2 ) conversion non-immunosuppressant drug ; 3 ) conversion patient take twice daily MPA daily MPA .</detailed_description>
