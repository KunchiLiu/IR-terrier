	<brief_summary>A Phase IIIb ( Three b ) , Randomized Multicentre Comparative Trial Evaluate Long Term Effectiveness &amp; Safety use Carglumic Acid ( Carbaglu® ) Patients Propionic Acidemia ( PA ) Methylmalonic Acidemia ( MMA ) . Carbaglu® clinical experience Organic Acidemia ( OA ) limit non-comparative retrospective collection data patient receive Carbaglu® 1 15 day . There current evidence support use carglumic acid chronic management patient OA . The investigator propose randomize multicentre prospective clinical trial evaluate long-term effect use Carbaglu® ( 50mg/kg/day ) combine standard chronic therapy patient PA MMA compare standard chronic therapy alone .</brief_summary>
