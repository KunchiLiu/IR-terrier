	<detailed_description>In 2010 , U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) provide Grade recommendation B ( i.e . service recommend moderate/high certainty benefit ) clinicians screen child age 6-17 year obesity refer identify youth comprehensive behavioral program .

Findings 6-month pilot study examine effectiveness JOIN demonstrate impressive change weight status school age child , modest result adolescent . The primary aim study modify JOIN program increase effectiveness adolescent retain potential scalability . A total 120 adolescent ( age 13-17 ) BMI &gt; 85th % &lt; 50 randomly assign 16-week targeted program ( TEEN JOIN ) , traditional JOIN intervention , follow biweekly monthly maintenance session . Evaluation adolescent height , weight , objective physical activity psychosocial outcome obtain baseline , 4 month , 10 month . Additional outcomes include treatment feasibility , include attendance , completion diet physical activity monitoring log , exit interview adolescent parent regard intervention . The investigator also obtain preliminary indicator cost effectiveness . It hypothesize adolescent randomize TEEN JOIN demonstrate great decrease BMI 4 10 month randomize JOIN . It hypothesize adolescent randomize TEEN JOIN demonstrate great increase participation moderate-vigorous physical activity great improvement self-concept , self-efficacy related physical activity , group cohesion adolescent receive standard JOIN condition .</detailed_description>
