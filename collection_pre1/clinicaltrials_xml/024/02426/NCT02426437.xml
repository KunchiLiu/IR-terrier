	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) chronic lung disease primarily cause smoking . COPD create tremendous burden healthcare system , disease exacerbation result frequent , prolonged hospitalization . While originally consider disease specific lung , data show COPD associate substantial cardiovascular ( CV ) morbidity mortality . Exacerbations COPD require hospitalization result mark patient deterioration , heighten CV risk . The cause increase CV risk stable COPD , exaggerate CV risk exacerbation disease unknown ; however , may due chronic inflammation exacerbate flare-up disease , and/or chronic inactivity similarly worsen bed-rest hospitalization . Despite impact COPD healthcare , relatively study examine COPD inpatient care impact patient outcome , inflammation CV risk . Disease management program , pulmonary rehabilitation patient self-management education , part guideline therapy COPD ; however , regularly implement follow hospitalization , intervention affect patient outcome , behavior , physical activity , inflammation CV risk well study . The propose long-term project examine early referral chronic disease management program hospital discharge , affect patient outcomes . This study provide invaluable information outpatient management disease tremendous impact healthcare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining Pulmonary Rehabilitation Discharged COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To examine impact early pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) follow hospital discharge QoL , pulmonary/CV outcome AECOPD hospitalization . Rationale : In addition typical improvement QoL exercise tolerance , study show PR increase self-efficacy physical activity reduce CV risk stable COPD patient . Patients recently discharge hospital follow AECOPD represent sick patient greatly reduce QoL , exercise tolerance , self-efficacy physical activity . Exactly improve PR follow hospitalization require examination . Hypothesis : Patients receive early PR improve QoL , pulmonary/CV outcomes less hospitalization COPD 6 month follow hospital discharge . PR improve self efficacy , physical activity QoL reduce CV risk compare usual care . Study Design &amp; Subject Recruitment : All patient admit pulmonary ward AECOPD , offer participation study . Patients find acute cardiac injury admission , mobility issue residence outside great Edmonton area exclude . Consenting patient subsequently randomize one three group : early PR versus late PR versus usual care . Patients randomize PR enrol within 1 ( Early PR ; EPR ) 3 month ( Late PR ; LPR ) discharge PR program . Usual care patient followed-up responsible physician determine admit team . The PR group enrol Breathe Easy Program Center Lung Health , proceed program typical fashion . All patient follow 6 month discharge interview assess disease status , management review history recurrence relapse AECOPD . Hospital admission length stay data obtain electronic medical record . Patient assessment include : quality life , 6min walk , dyspnea , self-efficacy , physical activity , pulse wave velocity , vascular function , systemic inflammation ( TNFα , MMP-2 , IL-6 CRP ) FeNO . All data collect , immediately 6 month PR . The control group data collect scheduled time . See description method . Data Handling : Data enter onto secure anonymized database . Data Analysis : The influence PR QoL , 6min walk , dyspnea , self-efficacy , physical activity , pulse wave velocity , vascular function , systemic inflammation eNO analyze use multivariate mixed-model MANOVA treatment ( Early-PR vs. Late-PR vs. usual care ) fix between-group variable time ( pre , immediate post , 6months post ) repeat variable . Sample size : Based previous work , sample size 50 group ( 150 total ) sufficient detect between-group difference QoL , 6min walk , PWV , dyspnea hospital readmission rate follow PR ( α=0.05 , β=0.8 ) . Based investigator recent work , sample could detect 10 % difference physical activity follow PR ( α=0.05 , β=0.8 ) . One hundred fifty patient also allow stratification physiological psychological response PR .</detailed_description>
