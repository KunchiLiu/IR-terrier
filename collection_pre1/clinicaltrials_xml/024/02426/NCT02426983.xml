	<brief_summary>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive form brain stimulation use weak constant current temporarily excite brain area interest via small electrode place scalp . Currently , tDCS use tool investigate mental process ( cognition ) motor function ( movement ) healthy control treat neurological ( i.e . stroke ) psychiatric ( i.e . depression dementia ) patient . tDCS find improve motor process cognitive performance , include attention memory function . This study attempt examine effect tDCS specific aspect short term memory sound measured electrical activity ( EEG ) top scalp . This study also assess effect drug , dextromethorphan ( DMO ) , commonly find cough syrup , think regulate tDCS treatment brain receptor . The study involve four laboratory test session . EEG assessments do two session involve 'anodal ' tDCS stimulation ( temporarily excite cortical activity locally ) , one session DMO treatment one placebo treatment , two session involve 'sham ' tDCS stimulation ( device turn ) , DMO placebo treatment . These finding contribute understand brain chemistry involve tDCS treatment effect cognitive ability .</brief_summary>
