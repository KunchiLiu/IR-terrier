	<detailed_description>This prospective single-center , superiority , open randomize controlled trial compare sedation interruption protocol routine continuous sedation mechanically ventilation ( MV ) child . The study conduct twelve bed Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) Montreal Children 's Hospital , pediatric tertiary care teach hospital . Patients enrol prospectively within 24 hour intubation MV . After obtain write consent patient randomize interrupted sedation standard sedation protocol . The investigator randomize use computer-generated sequence random number . A Sedation protocol use group adjust continuous infusion sedatives/analgesics target Comfort-Behavior scale . In intervention group , sedation infusion interrupt daily 8:00 AM , interruption continue patient under-sedated accord Comfort Behavior scale goal presence symptom hemodynamic instability respiratory distress . Then patient receive bolus sedation infusion restart dose 50 % le previous dose return Comfort Score goal .</detailed_description>
