	<brief_summary>This prospective randomize open label trial control-to-treatment cross-over . The investigator wish ass effectiveness safety immediate detection treatment Sleep Apnea Stroke patient . The investigator hypothesize patient acute ischemic stroke sleep apnea treatment CPAP result well neurological outcome successful rehabilitation . The study enroll 140 subject randomize one two arm : - Investigational - The sleep study perform index hospitalization acute stroke . Following diagnosis sleep apnea , patient treat C-PAP hospital stay discharge . - Control group -Will receive standard medical care . Patients undergo sleep study 3 month follow discharge patient diagnose sleep apnea treat C-PAP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Of Early C-PAP Treatment For Sleep Apnea On Rehabilitation Of Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients eligible enrolled study patient admit Department Neurology due acute ischemic stroke 72 hour start stroke symptom . After receive write informed consent patient , patient randomize intervention control group ( 1:1 ) . The intervention group test sleep apnea C-PAP treatment initiate initial hospitalization . The control group receive standard medical care . Control group patient undergo sleep study 3 month follow discharge patient diagnose sleep apnea treat C-PAP . All subject : - At baseline , physical examination MRS NIHSS perform neurologist . - Sleep test baseline mobile sleep lab device ( Watch PAT ) - Four questionnaire administer patient : Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , quality life ( SF36 ) , depression scale ( Beck ) . - Blood sample take CRP , TNF-alpha , IL-6 IL1 beta , VEGF , HBA1C , LDL markers endothelial dysfunction . These blood test repeat 3 6 month . - At discharge Neurology Department , 3 month 6 month patient undergo NIHSS assessment . - Patients refer Soroka stroke clinic rehabilitation program . - All patient undergo 3 brain MRI scan , baseline hospitalization , 3 6 month . Intervention group : - In intervention group , mobile sleep lab device ( Watch PAT ) use identify patient sleep apnea . - Treatment phase : Patients ( apnea hypopnea index ) AHI≥15 receive in-hospital treatment CPAP continue CPAP treatment follow discharge . The CPAP parameter titrate hospital stay . Control group : - Patients receive standard medical care . At three month , patient undergo home sleep test Watch-PAT device . - Patients ( apnea hypopnea index ) AHI≥15 receive CPAP treatment titration home . TRIAL PROCEDURES 1 . Patients eligible enrolled study patient admit Neurology Department due stroke 72 hour show stroke symptom . 2 . At baseline , physical examination , MRS NIHSS perform one Neurology Department doctor . 3 . After receive write informed consent patient , patient divide 2 group . Study group detection treatment 72 hour stroke . Control group detection treatment 3 month stroke . STUDY AND CONTROL GROUP 1 . The patient answer four questionnaire : Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , `` quality life '' ( SF36 ) `` depression scale '' ( beck ) . 2 . Next , mobile sleep lab device ( Watch PAT ) place patient 's finger provide apnea-hypopnea Index ( AHI ) respiratory disturbance index ( RDI ) . 3 . Blood sample circulate inflammatory biomarkers endothelial dysfunction perform morning . Four tubes peripheral venous blood drawn . Every study patient test presence pro-inflammatory state . Specifically , investigator measure presence high sensitive C Reactive Protein ( CRP ) centrifuge serum test ( ultra- sensitive ELISA ) , level circulate TNF-alpha , IL-6 IL1 beta . Sera also test vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) markers endothelial dysfunction ; P-selectin . LDL , HBA1C . 4 . At discharge Neurology Department , patient undergo NIHSS assessment . 5 . Half patient randomly choose ask join `` early treatment '' group 6 month C-PAP treatment . Patients half ask C-PAP treatment 3 month ( late intervention ) . 6 . All four questionnaire complete patient end follow period . 7 . MRI scan do three point : CVA admission , 3 6 month . 8 . Six month baseline hospitalization , patient group answer four questionnaire : Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , `` quality life '' ( SF36 ) `` depression scale '' ( beck ) .</detailed_description>
