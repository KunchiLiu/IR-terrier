	<detailed_description>Participant recruitment 15 people early AD recruit Sheffield Teaching Hospital Sheffield Health Social Care NHS Trusts memory clinic . The STH clinic neurology lead see work age ( &lt; 65 year old ) patient SHSC clinic see older ( &gt; 65 year old ) population . Over 1300 new assessment conduct every year . Approximately 65-70 % diagnosed dementia . Investigators choose patient typical neuropsychological profile AD . All patient previously recruit Virtual Physiological Human : Dementia Research enable IT . VPH-DARE @ IT recruit 30-40 participant three follow group ( mild AD , MCI normal control ) thus participant draw group pre-existing high-resolution 3D structural volumetric assessment plus resting-state fMRI scan . This resting-state fMRI data analyse examine DMN , allow u directly compare measure brain-connectivity EEG fMRI contrast discriminatory ability two methodology . 10 healthy control age match recruit either Neurology clinic spouse study participant . The investigator endeavour recruit normal control undergone fMRI part academic neuroradiology department control population VPH-DARE @ IT study . People AD 10 healthy control repeat EEG ass reproducibility robustness EEG measure . EEG normally well tolerate list background use many people dementia . The Clinical Neurophysiology department experience undertaking EEG patient population neonates elderly . Consent Participants identify clinician work memory clinic poster memory clinic University sit attract normal volunteer . A Participation Information Sheet ( PIS ) give either directly via post . Participants sufficient time read PIS able ask question . The PIS inform participant benefit potential risk involve take part study . They make aware possibility incidental change rarely detect . If see would inform would arrange appropriate management . The person consent come EEG recording . Investigators explain participant able leave study time include EEG recording plan repeat EEG decline 2nd test . The Clinical Department Neurophysiology experience perform EEG age include dementia cognitive impairment . The person dementia 's care-giver family member come department room entire time EEG record take place . Methodology EEG data capture - Participants attend department clinical neurophysiology member research team take consent . Two experience EEG technician place electrode explain procedure . We record rest state EEG . Participants tell lie still eye close . It explain although eye close must remain awake . Participants continuously monitor become drowsy re-stimulated time drowsiness record . This instruction monitoring use previous EEG fMRI study look rest state paradigm . - The 10-10 International system electrode placement use scalp EEG recording multichannel high sample rate amplifier ( 2 KHz ) . This provide standard 10/20 electrode position ( F3 , F4 , F7 , F8 , C3 , C4 , Fz , Cz , T3 , T4 , T5 , T6 , P3 , P4 , O1 , O2 , Oz electrodes ) initially use detect significant spatiotemporal measurements/phenomena offering opportunity elaborate spatial frequency resolution finding later stage . Peri-ocular EOG electrode data also record detect eye movement relate slow wave activity . Investigators therefore able avoid spurious estimate slow wave activity anterior EEG region . - Artefact free epoch within suitable ( wakeful task eye close state ) select exported quantitative EEG analysis . - The export data store external encrypted drive . - All analysis perform custom make in-house software high tech computer locate within secure office lock within Dr Sarrigannis 's office house department clinical neurophysiology . EEG Data analyse • The error reduction ratio-causality method use calculate level synchronisation . The standard EEG 10-20 electrode , include possible contiguous electrode combination pair two ( e.g . right frontocentral versus parietoccipital ) use pilot exploration assess 95 % confidence interval level synchronisation determine allow robust separation healthy volunteer patient Alzheimer 's Disease . Other Data • Qualitative Data collection : Investigators collect questionnaire tolerability undergo EEG examination ( please find enclosed questionnaire ) . Ethical consideration Modern neuro-imaging use MRI highly sensitive detect incidental finding . Our novel EEG analysis also potential detect incidental finding . It well know spike inter-ictal EEG limit clinical significance . However see frequently people liability , lower threshold , epilepsy . If concern raise EEG finding participant review Dr Blackburn appropriate refer onto another neurological colleague . Any incidental finding detect MRI refer NHS neurologist VPH-DARE @ IT project researcher . The Patient Information Sheet consent make participant aware risk take part study . Statistics This pilot project explore EEG data investigate frequency time domain measurement would appropriate clinical use . Investigators know whether involve linear non-linear interaction thus determine appropriate statistical test . The analysis similar EEG data set use parametric method explore detail . Power calculation As proof-of-concept , pilot study examine robustness novel methodology , inappropriate conduct formal power calculation . Our initial finding determine whether EEG analyse detect functional connectivity correlate synchronisation anterior posterior network identify fMRI BOLD signal rest state scanning . Investigators also explore data comparable previously publish quantitative EEG people AD . Investigators explore measure data discriminate people Alzheimer 's disease healthy control . These initial result give u likely effect size allow u conduct accurate power calculation presently possible . This used determine sample size large study people dementia .</detailed_description>
