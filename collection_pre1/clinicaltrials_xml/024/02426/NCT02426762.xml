	<brief_title>Quick Skin Sealant Closure Surgical Wound After Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Study design : A prospective cohort study - Populations : Patients confirm diagnosis gastric cancer , colorectal cancer , gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) , inflammatory bowel disease diverticulum decide receive laparoscopic surgery . - Surgical technique : laparoscopic operation successfully perform 3-4 cm minimal incision leave sample retrieval . In , five trocar-associated mini incision sample-retrieval incision would leave prior skin closure . - Skin closure : A quick skin sealant would apply achieve seal , without suture make skin . - Postoperative treatment : An enhanced recovery surgery ( ERAS ) bundle would apply enrolled subject . As wound management , additional wound care require . Patients take shower postoperative day 3 ( POD3 ) . - Primary endpoint : The primary study endpoint freedom surgical site infection ( SSI ) within 30 day . The incidence surgical site infection first 30 day surgery would explore .</detailed_description>
