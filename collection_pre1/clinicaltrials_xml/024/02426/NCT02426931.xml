	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety efficacy novel tip-flexible semi-rigid ureterorenoscope treatment renal calculus use prospective , randomized multicentre trial design . Half participant receive retrograde intrarenal surgery use tip-flexible semi-rigid ureterorenoscope , half participant receive retrograde intrarenal surgery use classic flexible ureteroscope .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tip-flexible Semi-rigid Ureterorenoscope Versus Flexible Ureteroscopy Renal Calculi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retrograde intrarenal surgery use flexible ureteroscope become first-line treatment renal calculus &lt; 3.0 cm recommend European Association Urology due minimally-invasive nature satisfactory result . However , limitation still remain . Poor maneuverability , extra cost ureteral access sheath , high device vulnerability still preclude flexible ureteroscopy wider distribution . Recently , investigator present novel ureterorenoscope , compose retractable rigid sheath semi-rigid ureteroscope flexible part tip . When flexible tip inner shaft maintains within sheath , work `` rigid mode '' , tip-flexible semi-rigid ureterorenoscope capable passing either orifice physiological tortuosity ureter ease . When inner shaft extend beyond sheath , endoscope switch `` flexible mode '' , capable perform intrarenal approach . This endoscope integrate classic semi-rigid flexible ureteroscope structurally functionally , approve clinical application China Food Drug Administration . In study , transverse comparison design evaluate safety efficacy tip-flexible semi-rigid ureterorenoscope treatment renal calculus .</detailed_description>
