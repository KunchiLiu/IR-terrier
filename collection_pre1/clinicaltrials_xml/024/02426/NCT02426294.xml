	<detailed_description>1 . Background Complications diabetes could cause death stroke myocardial infarction , chronic disease lead foot amputation , blindness renal failure . According data Statistics Korea , prevalence rate diabetes people 30 year old ( standardization ) gradually increase 8.6 % 2001 9.7 % 2010 . Although diabetes direct cause death disability , become significant health problem across world major illness cause complication . Diabetic complication common ; patient end-stage renal failure diabetes 56.7 % patient begin renal replacement therapy diabetes 70.5 % 2003 . The prevalence rate eye problem include cataract , retinopathy glaucoma diabetic patient 1.9 time higher non-diabetic patient . In addition , estimate incidence rate acute stroke , complication great vessel diabetic patient , also 5.2 time higher general population . As diabetes could cause various complication dangerous , regulation blood glucose level essential order prevent complication . According Korea National Health &amp; Nutrition Examination Survey 2008~2010 , rate patient well-controlled glycated hemoglobin 6.5 % among diabetic patient 30 year old 25 % . Thus , many study conduct low glycated hemoglobin administer various line drug , alone combination , regulation blood glucose difficult many diabetic patient . When regulation blood glucose end failure single dose drug , combination treatment recommend . Metformin mainly use first-order treatment drug , second third drug , dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor sulphonylurea , recommend use first one sufficient . DPP-4 inhibitor new line hypoglycemic agent base incretin . It statistically significant result regulation glycated hemoglobin compare exist oral hypoglycemic agent . Therefore , many clinician use Metformin first-order drug , DPP-4 inhibitor second-order drug . Alogliptin , recently prove side effect cardiovascular system , effective regulation blood glucose well weight control prevention hypoglycemia . Moreover , effective administer alone , also effective coadministered Metformin , Glibenclamide Pioglitazone . In particular , reduction degree glycated hemoglobin significantly large administer Pioglitazone . Sulphonylurea , well-known hypoglycemic agent , helpful regulation blood glucose reduces occurrence frequency hypoglycemia combine Metformin . 2 . Rationale This study examine relate factor Pioglitazone group , TZDs line , Glimepiride group , sulphonylurea line , third-order drug patient coadministered Metformin Alogliptin , DPP-4 inhibitor . 3 . Hypothesis When SU TZDs drug administer third-order drug patient administer second-order drug , treatment effect different two drug 4 . Primary Aim/Objective : The primary objective compare mean change HbA1c week 26 two group , SU ( glimepiride ) administration TZDs ( Pioglitazone ) administration , third-order drug among patient whose treatment sufficient combine administration Metformin Alogliptin . 5 . Primary Endpoint ( ) : The mean change HbA1c week 26 baseline</detailed_description>
