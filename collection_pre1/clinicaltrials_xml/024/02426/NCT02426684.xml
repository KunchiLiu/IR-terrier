	<brief_summary>IdeS® IgG-degrading enzyme S.pyogenes cleave four human subclasses IgG strict specificity . Alloantibodies major deterrent access success life-saving organ transplant . We hypothesize use IdeS® pre-transplant HS patient represent robust complete technique eliminate DSA serum HS patient . A single dose administration IdeS® pre-operative period HS patient positive DSAs flow cytometry crossmatches durably eliminate circulate DSAs , allow transplantation occur without ABMR , conjunction standard desensitization therapy , result durable suppression DSA level thus eliminate risk ABMR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ides Highly Sensitized Patients Awaiting Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center phase I/II open label , dose escalating , exploratory study assess safety efficacy IdeS® ( Hansa Medical , Lund , Sweden ) give immediately prior kidney transplantation . We hope IdeS® help eliminate DSAs HS patient DSA+ flow cytometry ( FCMX ) crossmatch + time transplant . We plan enroll total 20 patient . Patients follow 6 month post administration IdeS® .</detailed_description>
