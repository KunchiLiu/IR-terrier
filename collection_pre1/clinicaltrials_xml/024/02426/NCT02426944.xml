	<detailed_description>Interventional leave atrial appendage closure vs. novel anticoagulation agent high-risk patient atrial fibrillation ( PRAGUE-17 study ) INTRODUCTION Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common sustain cardiac arrhythmia prevalence 1-2 % general population ; additionally , incidence increase age . ( 1 ) Among elderly 75 year old , incidence 12 % . ( 2 ) AF associate five-fold risk cardioembolic event ; approximately 20 % stroke due AF . ( 3 ) The annual risk stroke AF patient 5 -6 % AF patient without antithrombotic treatment . Moreover , stroke due AF typically severe , i.e . associate bad neurological deficit . ( 4 ) Not incidence AF increase age , risk stroke AF patient also increase age age : patient 50-59 year , risk stroke 1.5 % , patient 80 - 90 , risk increase 23 % . ( 5 ) The source embolic stroke thrombus , form leave atrium ( LA ) due insufficient mechanical contraction LA . Most often thrombi arise leave atrial appendage ( LAA ) ; accord data autopsy finding transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) AF patient , approximately 90 % leave atrial thrombus arise LAA . ( 6 ) In addition insufficient mechanical contraction LA , pro-coagulant status patient also play important role thrombus development . A patient 's risk profile characterize accord CHA2DS2-VASc score . Each letter present one recognize risk factor ( C - congestive heart failure leave ventricular dysfunction , H - hypertension , A - age &gt; 75 year ( 2 point ) , D - diabetes , S - history stroke ( 2 point ) , V - present vascular disease ( atherosclerosis ) , A - age &gt; 65 year , Sc- female sex . In CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system , risk factor evaluate either 1 2 point . The sum point present annual risk cardioembolic event , percent . The prevention stroke systemic cardioembolic event ( thrombus embolize peripheral artery upper low extremity , artery supply gastrointestinal tract , renal artery etc . ) involve treatment use anticoagulant drug , , recently , vitamin K antagonist ( e.g . warfarin ) . These drug block effect vitamin K liver , turn block production coagulant factor II , VII , IX , X . As result , coagulation cascade slow . The efficacy warfarin estimate use International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ; effective INR prevent thrombus formation AF patient 2.0 3.0 . The amount vitamin K food varies , lead variation INR despite stable warfarin dose . This represent one disadvantage warfarin treatment . In large randomized trial , patient carefully follow , 65 % INR value successfully maintain 2.0 3.0 . ( 7 ) In real clinical praxis , show 50 % INR value within desired range . ( 8 ) This easily lead overtreatment undertreatment patient . Vitamin K antagonism think effective 70 % INR value maintain therapeutic range . ( 9 ) Another disadvantage warfarin treatment involve dietary restriction . Recently , several new drug block coagulation discover , appropriately name novel anticoagulant ( NOAC ) . These new drug include direct thrombin ( factor IIa ) inhibitor , dabigatran , inhibitor factor Xa , rivaroxaban apixaban . In contrast warfarin , block single step coagulation cascade . The dose drug adjust base laboratory test , like warfarin . Stable concentration drug achieve twice daily dosing , accord half-lives . Dosing need adjust significant comorbidity ( i.e . renal liver function ) dietary restriction need . In large prospective multicenter study , NOAC non-inferior warfarin , i.e . prevention systemic cardioembolic event similar patient treat warfarin NOAC . ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ( 13 ) Additionally , NOAC associate slightly good safety profile relative low frequency intracranial bleeding . ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ( 13 ) The prevention thrombus formation fibrillate atrium anticoagulation show effective ; however , adverse bleeding event occur warfarin ( even therapeutic range ) NOAC . The frequency ( major minor ) bleed NOAC treatment approximately 15-18 % per year ; severe bleed lead hospitalization even death . The risk bleeding estimate use HAS-BLED scoring system . Each letter present risk factor bleeding ( H - hypertension , A - abnormal liver renal function , S - history stroke , B - history bleeding , L - labile INR , E - elderly patient , D - drug , alcohol consumption ) . Patients HAS-BLED score &gt; 3 consider high risk bleeding . The limitation anticoagulative drug one reason behind development nonpharmacological treatment AF . Because 90 % leave atrial thrombus occur LAA ; ( 6 ) occlusion LAA main non-pharmacological option prevention cardioembolic event LA . LAA occlusion perform use percutaneous approach ; catheter insert femoral vein via transseptal puncture LA . The LAA visualize close use special device . Currently , two different device present market ( Watchman , Boston Scientific Amplatzer Cardiac Plug , St. Jude Medical ) . The large trial publish regard LAA occlusion PROTECT trial . ( 14 ) In prospective randomize multicenter trial , occlusion LAA use Watchman device compare standard warfarin treatment . The LAA occlusion non-inferior warfarin ; incidence cardioembolic event death similar group ( 3 % patient per year LAA occlusion group vs. 4.9 % patient per year warfarin group ) . The major disadvantage LAA occlusion relate peri-procedural device-related complication , present 7.4 % patient per year . Fifty-five percent report adverse event occur day procedure often significant pericardial effusion , present 4.8 % patient . In summary , LAA occlusion associate significant risk peri-procedural complication ; additionally , reduce , risk thrombus formation LA eliminate . In study assess LAA occlusion , periprocedural device-related complication occur 6 - 8 % . ( 15 ) Despite risk , LAA occlusion present promise alternative anticoagulant treatment patient high risk bleeding , contraindicate warfarin NOAC . For patient high CHA2DS2-VASc HAS-BLED score , study publish date , study progress accord randomize trial study registry . The inclusion criterion PROTECT study CHADS2 score &gt; 1 , approximately 1/3 patient CHADS2 1 . ( 14 ) The anticoagulation treatment well establish majority patient AF standard clinical practice ; however , despite anticoagulation treatment , systemic cardioembolic event occur bleed risk serious . In large study rivaroxaban , ROCKET study , drug compare warfarin , annual incidence stroke 1.7 - 2.2 % patient annual incidence bleeding ( major minor ) 15 % ( 11 ) Similarly , ARISTOTLE study , another NOAC apixaban compare warfarin , annual incidence cardioembolic event 1.27 - 1.6 % , annual risk major clinically significant bleed 4 - 6 % . ( 10 ) The best treatment AF patient high risk , i.e . patient high CHA2DS2-VASc score high bleeding risk , still know . Moreover , number patient increase due increase age general population . Therefore , treatment patient present serious problem clinical practice search optimal solution warrant . The safety profile NOAC seem slightly good warfarin ; nonetheless , bleed risk NOAC negligible , evident compare CHA2DS2-VASc HAS-BLED score system : factor increase risk thrombotic bleeding event . The Aim project compare LAA occlusion NOAC randomize multicenter study AF patient great risk . Such randomize study never do . PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients AF indication anticoagulation eligible study . Inclusion criterion presence AF ( paroxysmal , persistent permanent ) , sign inform consent one follow criterion 1. history significant bleeding ( i.e . bleeding require intervention hospitalization ) , even absence anticoagulation treatment time bleed event , 2. cardioembolic event , occur anticoagulation , 3. high risk profile patient , define CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 3 HAS-BLED score ≥ 2 Exclusion criterion follow : 1. thrombus LA LAA ; 2. mechanical valve prosthesis ; 3. mitral stenosis ; 4. previous LAA ligation cardiac surgery ; 5. life expectancy le 2 year ; 6. comorbidities AF , present indication anticoagulation ; 7. patent foramen ovale atrial septal aneurysm 8. mobile plaque aorta ; 9. symptomatic atherosclerosis carotid artery ; 10. pericardial effusion great 10 mm ; 11. clinically significant bleeding within 30 day prior scheduled procedure ; 12. stroke cardioembolic event within 30 day prior scheduled procedure ; 13. acute coronary syndrome within 90 day prior schedule procedure , 14. gravidity , 15. significant valvular disease , 16. creatinine clearance le 30 ml/min A routine TEE do patient randomization . If patient randomize LAA occlusion arm , TEE examination do exclude presence thrombus LA LAA invasive procedure . The presence thrombus LAA LA additional exclusion criterion ( patient thrombus LAA remove analysis ) . Next , cardiac CT do ass morphology LAA , blood sample drawn assessment natriuretic peptide cytokine . Patients randomize interventional LAA occlusion ( group A ) NOAC treatment ( group B ) 1/1 ratio , randomization do use web-based randomization software . The software design respect CHA2DS2VASc characteristic patient , i.e. , goal comparable CHA2DS2VASc arm end study . The randomization process do outside participate center therefore mask study subject site personnel . For randomize group A ( LAAO group ) , interventional LAA occlusion perform . The type LAA occlusion system leave discretion implant center ; however , Amulet device ( St. Jude Medical ) Watchman device ( Boston Scientific ) available use study . The goal achieve approximately half patient implant Watchman system ( Boston Scientific ) half implant Amulet system ( St. Jude Medical ) . The protocol LAA imaging procedure use current praxis surgeon : procedure do TEE , ICE , angiographic visualization control , depend experience preference particular center surgeon . After procedure , patient treat combination aspirin 100 mg ( daily ) clopidogrel 75 mg ( daily ) three month . After three month , control TEE do . If TEE find satisfactory ( i.e. , absence thrombus device , absence peri-device leakage leakage line le 5 mm , satisfactory position device assess surgeon ) , clopidogrel discontinue , however , aspirin ( 100 mg , daily ) continue . Additional transesophageal echocardiography plan unless indicated clinical status patient . In patient , duration dual antiplatelet treatment could individualize take consideration particular risk patient . In patient high bleed risk ( e.g . patient history repeat bleeding ) , duration dual antiplatelet treatment could shorten 6 week . After , control TEE yield satisfactory result , clopidogrel could discontinue patient could leave aspirin monotherapy . Six-weeks dual antiplatelet treatment recently show sufficient LAA occlusion . ( 16 ) On hand , patient significant thrombotic risk ( e.g . history repeat cardioembolic event , without history overt bleed ) , duration dual antiplatelet treatment could prolong 6 month . The decision ( i.e. , assessment individual risk profile implant patient ) patient-specific approach leave discretion treat physician . Experience LAA occlusion procedure In study publish regard LAA occlusion , experience interventional cardiologist ( learn curve ) staff show important ; i.e . number complication first implantation significantly high compare follow . ( 14 , 17 ) To prevent interventional lack experience affect outcome , two team start perform procedure initiation study , goal least 5- 10 LAA occlusion start study . This first 5-10 LAA occlusion do accord inclusion criterion study , patient enrol accord current standard criterion guideline LAA occlusion . Additionally , first 5-10 procedure study do assistance interventional cardiologist experience LAA occlusion . For randomized group B ( NOAC group ) , patient treat use register NOAC ( rivaroxaban , apixaban dabigatran , preferentionally apixaban ) dose recommend manufacturer ( case apixaban 5 mg 2.5 mg twice daily ) adjust relative comorbidities ( body weight , age , renal function ) . Outpatient follow-up do 6 week , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month randomization every 6 month . At 6-month follow-up , blood sample drawn cytokine measurement . Endpoints : The primary endpoint study occurrence follow event within 24 month follow randomization : ( 1 ) stroke TIA ( type ) , ( 2 ) systemic cardioembolic event , ( 3 ) clinically significant bleed 4 ) cardiovascular death ( 5 ) significant peri-procedural device-related complication . A stroke define sudden onset focal neurologic deficit , nontraumatic cause , location consistent territory major cerebral artery categorize either ischemic , hemorrhagic , unspecified . An imaging examination ( CR , MRI ) recommend . A TIA define accord current standard criterion , i.e. , stroke relief symptom within 24 hour . Systemic cardioembolic event define acute vascular occlusion extremity organ , document imaging ( CT angiography , percutaneous interventional angiography ) , surgery , autopsy . Clinically significant bleed composite major non-major clinically significant bleeding . Clinically significant major bleeding define accord criterion International Society Thrombosis Hemostasis ( ISTH ) , clinically overt bleed accompanied one following : decrease hemoglobin level ≥ 20 g/l 24-hour period , transfusion 2 unit pack red cell , bleed critical site ( intracranial , intraspinal , intraocular , pericardial , intramuscular compartment syndrome , retroperitoneal ) , fatal bleeding . ( 18 ) This definition use recently trial compare NOAC warfarin . Clinically significant non-major bleeding define similarly ROCKET trial , i.e. , bleed require hospitalization invasive procedure , doesn´t meet ISTH major criterion . Peri-procedural device-related complication evaluate significant ( 1 ) pericardial effusion require drainage , surgery , pericardiocentesis , ( 2 ) cardioembolic event procedure , ( 3 ) significant peri-procedural bleeding ( i.e. , major vascular bleed require surgical revision , blood concentrate transfusion ) , ( 4 ) device embolization , ( 5 ) thrombus device consequent cardioembolic event . The secondary endpoint incidence component primary end-point ; quality life ( assessed patient use Health-related quality life questionnaire , i.e . questionnaire use PROTECT study ) ( 19 ) , minor bleeding , comparison economic cost , analysis change cytokine concentration ( natriuretic peptide inflammatory pro-thrombotic cytokine ) procedure 6 month , relationship LAA morphology success LAA occlusion risk systemic cardioembolic event . Minor bleeding define bleed report patient , meet criterion major clinically significant non-major bleeding . Economical comparison involve compare cost treatment group ( i.e . drug , device , hospitalization ) whole study period . Because LAA important source natriuretic peptide , patient , production hormone eliminate LAA occlusion , natriuretic peptide inflammatory thrombotic cytokine measure , 6 month randomization concentration compare . Statistics For randomized trial , power sample size calculation critical determinant overall success trial interpretation finding . The sample size calculation base follow assumption : power test = 0.8 , statistical significance border = 0.05 . Based information large previous trial NOAC , investigator assume 13 % patient NOAC group 10 % patient interventional group achieve primary endpoint per year . ( 15 ) With regard border non-inferiority , investigator expect 18 % patient achieve primary endpoint per year . This mean , non-inferiority hypothesis , 198 patient enrol group , i.e . total 396 study participant . Data analysis perform base intention-to-treat principle . For data description , standard descriptive statistical method use : absolute relative frequency categorical data median 5-95 % percentiles continuous data . For categorical variable , statistical analysis do use χ2 Fisher exact test ; continuous variable , Student t-test Mann-Whitney U test use . Kaplan-Meier curve calculate visualize occurrence end-points follow-up . The influence patient characteristic occurrence end-points calculate use logistic regression Cox proportional risk model , appropriate . Statistical analysis do use SPSS 22 software ( IBM Corporation , 2013 ) . DISCUSSION : The incidence AF increase increase age population . In cohort 4000 people Framingham study , follow 30 year , lifetime risk occurrence AF 40 year old man ( without previous AF ) 26 % 23 % woman . ( 20 ) . The CHA2DS2-VASc score also rise increase age , mean risk cardioembolic ( well bleed ) event also increase age ; therefore , number patient need , concurrently risk anticoagulant treatment , increase . The safety profile NOAC show large randomized study slightly well compare warfarin , mainly due slightly low incidence intracranial bleeding . LAA occlusion , show non-inferior warfarin large study ( 14 ) , possible alternative patient high risk bleeding . However , LAA occlusion associate significant number complication , therefore , risk interventional LAA occlusion `` acceptable '' mainly patient high risk bleed stroke.Until , publish ongoing study focus particular group high-risk patient ; example , inclusion criterion PROTECT trial CHADS2 &gt; 1 34 % PROTECT patient CHADS2 score 1 . ( 14 ) No study compare treatment NOAC vs. LAA occlusion publish . Because treatment particular patient complicate , progress relative complex set patient warrant much need .</detailed_description>
