	<detailed_description>Introduction Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) typical atrial flutteru successful method treatment atrial flutter . The acute ( peri-procedural ) efficacy 95 % . ( 1 ) Typical atrial flutter circuit use area inferior caval vein tricuspid anulus , RFA typical flutter perform provide linear lesion inferior caval vein tricuspid valve ( area call cavo-tricuspid isthmus ) . The recurrence atrial flutter ablation , cause non-transmural RF lesion , le 10 % case . ( 2 ) During atrial flutter ablation , typically three electrophysiological catheter use . Two catheter diagnostic ( one 10-pole inserted coronary sinus 20-pole inserted right atrium distal tip laterally cavo-ticuspid isthmus ) . The third ablation catheter , insert CT isthmus . The location three catheter monitor fluoroscopy EP signal catheter . Also ablation catheter ablation monitor fluoroscopy signal catheter . Despite high efficacy , RFA atrial flutter sometimes difficult . The difficulty do anatomical difference patient . ( 3 , 4 ) In area CTI , rudimentary Eustachian valve present , hide effective ablation CI tissue . Moreover , deep pouch present TI area , , unrecognized , present area insufficient ablation . Both , Eustachian valve pouch , visible fluoroscopy . In rare case , complete block CTI achieve , typically due anatomical difficulty . Furthermore , anatomical obstacle lead prolong fluoroscopy time ( find location conduction CTI rea ) , RF energy delivery prolonged procedure time . Longer ablation time increase risk ablation ( right atrial perforation ) . Next possible anatomical obstacle right coronary artery effective prevent sufficient ablation due cool effect . ( 5 ) Intracardiac echocardiography ( ICE ) do use intracardiac echo probe . The probe insert right atrium , allow visualize CTI area . ( 6 , 7 ) ICE use AF ablation center , effect never validate randomized study . The aim study ass whether routine use ICE lead decrease fluoroscopy time , decrease need RFA delivery ( i.e . number ablation ) decrease procedure time . On hand , safety endpoint ass whether routine use ICE associate high rate complication . We hypothesize , use ICE shorten fluoroscopy , ablation procedural time without increased number complication Patients method : Consecutive patient indicate due standard criterion ( i.e . accord guideline European Society Cardiology ) atrial flutter ablation enrol . Exclusion criterion absence write informed content history recent femoral vein thrombosis ( &lt; 6 month ) . Randomization : 1 1 ICE vs. non ICE RF ablation do routinely , do center . In Ice group , ICE probe insert left femoral vein right atrium TH ICE use visualization anatomy CTI area visualization catheter RF delivery . In case non-ICE group , RFA do without ICE catheter , do routinely . In group , diagnostic catheter ( 10-pole CS 20-po RA ) ablation catheter . In non-ICE group , location catheter assess fluoroscopy signal catheter . At end ablation , total fluoroscopy time , number length ablation duration procedure calculate . On day two week procedure , bleed complication assess . End-points : major end-points : 1 ) total procedure duration ( min ) 2 ) fluoroscopy time 3 ) number ablation 4 ) total duration RF energy delivery . Major safety end-point complication leave femoral ICE access .</detailed_description>
