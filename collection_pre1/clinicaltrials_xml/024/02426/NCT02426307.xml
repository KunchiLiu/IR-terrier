	<brief_summary>TAVR increasingly use technique treatment aortic valve stenosis . However , recent clinical experience suggest subclinical aortic valve bioprosthesis thrombosis may occur early valve replacement . The frequency potentially ominous phenomenon transcatheter surgical aortic valve bioprosthesis unknown , condition difficult detect . The recent development cardiac 4D computed tomography imaging ( 4DCT ) show great promise evaluation valve leaflet mobility morphology . The purpose study observational design ass frequency subclinical abnormal leaflet motion morphology patient treat transcatheter surgical aortic valve bioprosthesis . In addition , 'natural evolution ' phenomenon well relation medical treatment MACCE assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subclinical Aortic Valve Bioprosthesis Thrombosis Assessed With 4D CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MATERIAL In period May 2014 November 2015 , random subset patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) offer intensified post-procedural clinical image follow-up . It intend examine variety implant transcatheter heart valve ( THV ) well surgical aortic valve bioprosthesis . METHODS : Post-procedural clinical image follow-up encompasses follow : - Thoracic 4DCT scan - evaluation leaflet morphology leaflet motion - Transthoracic echocardiography - evaluation peak aortic valve gradient , mean aortic valve gradient , aortic valve area/effective orifice area ( cm2 ) , paravalvular leakage , central aortic valve regurgitation , leave ventricular ejection fraction - Clinical follow-up : improvement New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class dyspnea , major adverse cardiac cerebro-vascular event ( MACCE ) - Registration anti-coagulation/anti-thrombotic therapy follow aortic valve replacement All patient receive above-described post-procedural follow-up two different time-points : - The first follow-up contact plan 30 180 day TAVR SAVR procedure . The medical treatment change base generate data . - The second follow-up contact plan 120 180 day first follow-up contact ( see ) . This second follow-up offer possibility study 'natural evolution ' process . In patient abnormal leaflet morphology and/or motion , treatment rivaroxaban 20mg daily initiate . - Those patient initiated rivaroxaban second follow-up call third clinical image follow-up , focus leaflet morphology and/or motion rivaroxaban therapy . In case persistent abnormal leaflet morphology and/or motion despite NOAC , treatment Marevan ( INR 2-3 ) initiate . - Those patient initiate Marevan third follow-up call fourth clinical image follow-up contact .</detailed_description>
