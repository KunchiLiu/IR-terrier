	<brief_summary>This proposal aim investigate effect promise treatment persistent post Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) symptom , monitor TBI patient 's recovery objective technique along standard clinical assessment . The treatment tool application repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) brain . The treatment efficacy monitor TBI patient ' recovery objectively assess use Electrovestibulography ( EVestGTM ) ; parallel clinical standard assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Recovery Monitoring Post TBI Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TBI significant health problem mainly plausible prolonged sequela lack objective measure recovery . The conventional treatment TBI physical rehabilitation help motor functional recovery . However , usually disable persistent post-TBI symptom ( mostly neurological ) respond current clinical physical rehabilitation . rTMS , hand , promising , well-tolerated , non-invasive brain neuromodulation technique emerge therapeutic tool variety neurological condition . Thus , researcher ' aim investigate effect rTMS treatment post-TBI symptom patient identify medical collaborator ( Drs . Mansouri Salter ) . Equally important objective measure treatment efficacy patient 's symptoms recovery . EVestGTM noninvasive technique record neural activity vestibular apparatus vestibular nuclei external ear . After head injury , people commonly experience balance ( vestibular ) problem dizziness , well confused thinking . Considering well-known bidirectional anatomical link vestibular system , follow impact TBI , EVestG signal expect change , pilot study show great potential EVestG monitor impact TBI . Thus , researcher aim use EVestG objective measure monitor recovery path rTMS treatment parallel clinical neuro-psychological assessment .</detailed_description>
