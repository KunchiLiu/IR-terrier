	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , multicenter ( one hospital , medical school team medical clinic work medical research study ) study 2 dosing regimen ( treatment arm ) single-agent imetelstat participant intermediate-2 high risk myelofibrosis ( MF ) whose disease relapse refractory Janus Kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor treatment . Enrollment study may approximately 160 participant enrollment Arm 1 resume second interim review . The study consist 3 part : Screening Phase ( 21 day randomization ) ; single-blind Treatment Phase ( randomization study drug discontinuation ) ; Follow Phase ( death , lose follow-up , withdrawal consent study end , whichever occur first ) . Participants Arm 1 receive imetelstat 9.4 milligram ( mg ) /kilogram ( kg ) intravenously ( IV ) every 3 week disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , study end Arm 2 receive imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg IV every 3 week disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , study end . Participants Arm 2 may continue current imetelstat dose increase 9.4 mg/kg investigator 's discretion . Percentage spleen response symptom response evaluate primarily . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
