	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study well pemetrexed disodium work treat patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 3 . Performance status mean well patient able perform daily activity care . Patients performance status 3 limited ability move around . Currently , patient able perform daily activity may receive chemotherapy , due side effect may cause . Pemetrexed disodium cause few side effect many chemotherapy drug may help treat patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer low performance status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ECOG Performance Status 3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect single agent pemetrexed ( pemetrexed disodium ) tumor progression ECOG performance status 3 patient stage IV non-squamous histology non-small cell lung cancer single arm pilot study . II . To evaluate effect single agent pemetrexed quality life ECOG performance status 3 patient stage IV non-squamous histology non-small cell lung cancer single arm pilot study . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity associate single agent pemetrexed tumor progression ECOG performance status 3 patient stage IV non-squamous histology non-small cell lung cancer single arm pilot study . OUTLINE : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day every 6 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
