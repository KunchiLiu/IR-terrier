This gain well understand care pathway within NHS patient PPS . Although patient randomise , consent followed-up routinely obtain . What possible benefit risk participate ? By take part study patient may get helpful information condition . If assign CBT+SMC arm , patient receive 8 session CBT focus help manage symptom , may improve symptom increase psychosocial functioning . It unclear whether CBT patient PPS effective ; trial ass whether benefit receive . Patients may benefit follow closely complete measure . It expect participation study associate risk . The therapist involve trial highly qualified specialist extensive experience treating patient PPS . The trial team also include psychiatrist ensure patient safety complex case . Participants free take break point meeting free withdraw study point . Participants also inform raise concern may research team provide Patient Advice &amp; Liaison Service contact information .
