	<brief_summary>Current evidence suggest gut microbiota dietary influence important genetics aetiology Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . We recently show disease improvement , follow treatment Exclusive Enteral Nutrition ( EEN ) , coincide change gut microbiota . The main purpose study : ) explore whether gut microbiota change observe previous study child CD EEN disease specific , b ) develop novel food-based diet ( Crohn 's Disease TReatment-with-EATing/CD-TREAT diet ) induce change metabolic activity bacterial composition gut microbiota healthy people , similar see EEN , first-line treatment active paediatric CD . This study produce high quality scientific evidence move CD-TREAT diet towards preliminary clinical trial patient CD currently inappropriate unethical carry people active CD undertaking contemporary medical treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study randomise , cross-over , dietary intervention trial . Healthy adult ( &gt; 18 ) participant community recruit mean advertisement leaflet word mouth . Eligible participant enrol study . We thank subject express interest study suitable participate explain need exclude . Those eligible willing participate ask undertake two different experimental diet , seven day : 1 . Exclusive Enteral Nutrition ( EEN ) exclusive consumption milk-based proprietary dietary supplement ( Modulen® , Nestle ) . This liquid base diet use management child active CD . Although diet use primary clinical reason food base contain drug non-food base pharmaceutical ingredient . It available online without prescription pharmacist . 2 . Crohn 's Disease TReatment-with-EATing diet ( CD-TREAT diet ) , elimination customize diet consist ordinary food resemble food/nutrient composition EEN ( e.g . fibre content , fatty acid composition ) consider evidence implicates certain nutrient , food ingredient ( e.g . meat , sugar ) aetiology risk relapse CD . Diet create use food group exchange methodology analyse use Windiets® 2010 . Both diet energy content isocaloric aim keep participant ' weight stable study period . Their energy content tailor participant ' total energy expenditure physical activity level calculate WHO set equation . The order diet randomly allocate use MS Excel command . In order minimize fatigue diet also ensure able detect change gut microbiota , experimental diet give 7 day . This base recent evidence suggest dietary change 5 day induce reproducible alteration gut microbiota composition metabolism . Prior first diet intervention , participant also record dietary intake use 7-day estimate food diary . Between two intervention participant eat habitual diet two week wash period aim drive gut microbiota back baseline level . The week prior initiation second intervention participant ask keep dietary pattern week prior first trial . Detailed method : Preliminary Health Check : Participants undertake short health questionnaire include basic health information , age medication day recruitment . Anthropometry : All participant height weight measure baseline weight measure sample collection timepoint . Diet compliance : Over course two experimental diet monitor compliance ask participant complete questionnaire . The questionnaire ask felt need supplement diet time food drink . An interval call 2 day diet 's initiation also use increase participant ' motivation compliance diet . Sample collection &amp; analysis : Fresh faecal urine sample collect dietary intervention ( 4 time total ) ass compare impact diet gut microbiota composition metabolic activity . Lab Assays : 1 . The gut bacterial diversity composition stool sample measure use molecular technique quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) bacterial ribosomal DNA next generation sequencing ( metagenomics ) . 2 . A large number different product bacterial metabolism , short chain fatty acid , sulphide , ammonia measure use range technique include gas chromatography gas chromatography mass spectrometry ( GCMS ) ( metabolomics ) . Faecal pH , marker bacterial fermentation , also measure . Power calculation : Fresh faecal urine sample collect 38 healthy participant 4 time point . Based previous vivo work child CD would give u power 80 % ( p=0.05 ) detect mean concentration difference 1.0 log ( SD:1.5 ) Faecalibacterium prausnitzii habitual diet EEN diet CD-TREAT diet .</detailed_description>
