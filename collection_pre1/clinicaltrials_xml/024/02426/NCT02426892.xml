	<brief_title>Nivolumab HPV-16 Vaccination Patients With HPV-16 Positive Incurable Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : There 3 week Cycle 1 2 week Cycles 2 beyond . If find eligible take part study , receive ISA101 injection Day 1 Cycles 1 , 2 , 4 . You closely watch first 3 hour dose order check allergic reaction . Each time , receive 2 injection . One may arm one leg . You receive nivolumab vein 60 minute Day 8 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond . Study Visits : On Days 1 8 Cycle 1 Day 1 every cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycle 1 1 time month , become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . At Week 11 every 6 week , CT scan MRI check status disease . Additional Research Tests : Blood ( 20 teaspoon time ) drawn begin receive study treatment , receive ISA101 Weeks 3 7 , receive nivolumab Weeks 9 11 , every 12 week . If doctor think need white blood cell recovery store cell , one every 12 week blood draw may do earlier . These blood sample use biomarker test test immune system . Length Treatment : You may take ISA101 3 dos . You may continue take nivolumab long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . If disease seem like gotten bad , may decide continue receive nivolumab , still eligible . It possible study drug may work even though tumor ( ) get large . However , risk continue receive study drug disease may actually get bad . This described side effect section . Your participation study follow-up . Follow-up Visits : At 30 day 70 day last study drug dose , often doctor decides need , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . At 30 day , 70 day , every 6 week ( stop study drug [ ] reason disease get bad ) , CT MRI scan check status disease . If disease get bad , scan stop . Every 3 month 3 year last study drug dose , ask ( either visit phone ) . The call last 10 minute . This investigational study . ISA101 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Nivolumab FDA approve treat certain type melanoma patient longer respond drug . Combining ISA101 nivolumab investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 28 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Subjects histologically cytologicallydocumented incurable Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) 16 positive solid tumor include oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC ) , cervical , vulvar , vaginal , anal , penile cancer . Incurable HPV16 solid tumor define tumor curable salvage approach include resection and/or reirradiation . HPV16 serotype assess Cervista assay . 3 . Target Population : Subjects treatment na√Øve metastatic incurable locally advanced HPV16 positive solid tumor one prior line treatment.Patients eligible upon progression definitive local treatment ( usually concurrent chemoradiation ) candidate salvage surgery reirradiation . Patients also eligible progression first line chemotherapy recurrent disease . 4 . Target Population : d. Subjects must measurable disease CT MRI per RECIST 1.1 criterion ; Radiographic Tumor Assessment perform within 28 day study inclusion . e. Target lesion may locate previously irradiate field document ( radiographic ) disease progression site . f.
