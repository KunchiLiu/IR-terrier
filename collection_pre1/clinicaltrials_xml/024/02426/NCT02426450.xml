	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common cancer world . Partial hepatectomy liver transplantation consider standard curative therapy HCC . When surgery possible , percutaneous ablation usually consider alternative treatment HCC . Recurrence frequent serious adverse event observe follow-up HCC patient treated cure . Repeat hepatectomy effective treatment HCC recurrence , 5-year survival rate 19.4 56 % . Unfortunately , repeat hepatectomy perform small proportion patient HCC recurrence ( 10.4 31 % ) , either poor functional liver reserve widespread recurrence . Radiofrequency ablation consider one effective percutaneous ablation early-stage HCC patient without surgical prospect . Studies use RFA treat HCC recurrence hepatectomy report 3-year survival rate 62 % 68 % , comparable achieve surgery . RFA particularly suitable treat HCC recurrence hepatectomy tumor usually detect small , RFA cause least deterioration liver function patient . However , accord previous study , investigator find recurrent rate RFA high 60 % . Systemic chemotherapy consider one main treatment malignant tumor . HCC know highly refractory conventional systemic chemotherapy heterogeneity multiple etiology . Before advent molecular-targeted agent sorafenib , subsequently become standard care , standard systemic drug treatment regimen show obvious survival benefit HCC . Nowadays , systemic chemotherapy regimen definitively recommend standard treating HCC . Clinical activity several regimen contain oxaliplatin ( OXA ) advance HCC demonstrate phase II study . In phase II study FOLFOX4 ( infusional fluorouracil [ FU ] , leucovorin [ LV ] , OXA ) regimen Chinese patient HCC , median overall survival ( OS ) 12.4 month , mean time progression 2.0 month , response rate ( RR ) 18.2 % . The safety profile acceptable . Recently , result phase Ⅲ randomize study show FOLFOX4 serve palliative chemotherapy induce high overall survival , progression-free survival response rate compare doxorubicin patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma Asia . The safety data also acceptable . Therefore , investigator consider RFA effective treatment HCC recurrence curative treatment . So hypothesis RFA combine FOLFOX4 reduce high recurrence rate RFA recurrent HCC hepatectomy . The aim open-lable , single prospective study evaluate efficacy safety RFA combine FOLFOX4 systemic chemotherapy recurrent HCC partial hepatectomy .</brief_summary>
