	<brief_title>NuShield/Affinity Treatment Neuropathic Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This three ( 3 ) -arm evaluation 90 patient 3 facility diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) . Patients treat NuShield Affinity together standard therapy standard care alone . For purpose evaluation , standard therapy consist extensive debridement nonviable tissue , saline-moistened non-occlusive dressing , off-loading decrease pressure extremity , aggressive treatment infection arterial revascularization indicate . The patient receive NuShield Affinity plus standard therapy determine optimal application method . The evaluation duration 4 week 8-week 12-week follow-up visit . Patients diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer least 4 week duration free clinical sign infection time treatment may eligible inclusion . At Week -1 , patient undergo aggressive , surgical debridement . The site free fibrin , necrotic callous tissue . Digital image planimetery target ulcer perform pre- post initial debridement subsequent visit per evaluation schedule . This evaluation design investigate potential allogeneic placental-derived amniotic membrane accelerate heal low extremity DFU use conjunction standard therapy . This potential measured increase rate healing ( daily decrease percent wound area/volume compare initial debrided ulcer area/volume ) patient treat NuShield Affinity plus standard wound care compare patient treated standard good wound care alone . Studies Margolis co-worker demonstrate use surrogate marker , measure 4 8 week care , predictive ( &gt; 70 % ) wound heal patient DFU 20th week care . [ Kantor 1998 ; Margolis 2003 ] The secondary endpoint patient achieve complete closure ( 100 % ) week 12 .</detailed_description>
