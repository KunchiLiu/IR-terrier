	<brief_summary>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) chronic inflammatory disorder gastrointestinal tract include Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . A recent epidemiological investigation estimate nearly 4 million people worldwide affect approximately 1.4 million case occur United States . IBD lead debilitating symptom , hospitalization , decrease quality life , frequent procedure and/or surgery . Treatment option consist immunosuppressive therapy , systemic corticosteroid , immunomodulators ( thiopurines methotrexate ) and/or biologics , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF ) agent integrin inhibitor , vedolizumab . They achieve clinical remission decrease risk complication , also increase risk opportunistic infection , include influenza . Multiple study show low influenza vaccine responses patient IBD compare healthy individual ; IBD patient treat TNF agent combination therapy ( TNF inhibitor immunomodulators ) likely mount poor immune response . Influenza serum antibody concentration correlate protection infection follow vaccination . Therefore , increase influenza antibody responses patient IBD would appear critical improve protection influenza . A high dose ( HD ) influenza vaccine contain four time hemagglutinin license base ability induce high antibody concentration compare standard dose ( SD ) adults 65 year old .</brief_summary>
