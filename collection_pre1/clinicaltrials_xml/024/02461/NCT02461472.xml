	<brief_summary>A large-scale , community-based , cross-sectional study conduct explore extent risk factor associate diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy ( DCAN ) general Chinese population . A total 2000 diabetic participant recruit use multiple stage sample ( first cluster sample simply sample ) . Data involve demographic information , clinical biomarkers glucose lipid profile , medical therapy history collect . Every participant complete DNA extract genotyped . Diabetic Cardiovascular autonomic function measure use short-term heart rate variability ( HRV ) evaluate outcome DCAN . Univariate multiple variable analysis perform examine potential environmental genetic risk factor CAN . In addition , clinical risk model , simply screen model nonlinear system model artificial neural network create , respectively .</brief_summary>
