	<brief_title>Does Fidaxomicin Therapy Reduce Spread Clostridium Difficile ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fidaxomicin newly license drug treatment CDI . Patients treat fidaxomicin significantly low C. difficile spore count faeces patient receive alternative drug ( metronidazole vancomycin ) . In vitro evidence show drug persist gut several week treatment finish also prevent outgrowth spore . These finding suggest fidaxomicin therapy could associate less contamination CDI patient 's skin surround environment metronidazole vancomycin therapy . This prospective , case control study aim investigate hypothesis measure C. difficile spore count patient 's stool sample , skin surround environment . Results patient receive fidaxomicin compare either metronidazole vancomycin . If fidaxomicin therapy reduce contamination level , might useful adjunct exist measure use control CDI healthcare setting , particularly outbreak situation .</detailed_description>
