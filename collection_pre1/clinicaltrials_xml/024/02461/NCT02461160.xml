	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-915 . TAK-915 test find safe well-tolerated dose . This study look pharmacokinetic characteristic ( drug act throughout body ) drug safety tolerability ( lab result , vital sign , ECG , side effect ) healthy people ( include elderly ) take TAK-915 . The study enroll total approximately 112 patient . This study design consist 5 different dose schedule : single rise dose ( SRD ) , multiple rise dose ( MRD ) , drug-drug interaction ( DDI ) , bioavailability food effect ( BA/FE ) , Elderly Subject Single Dose ( ESSD ) . The study population SRD consist 48 participant enrol 6 cohort . Each cohort 8 randomized participant , 6 receive single dose TAK-915 , 2 receive match placebo fast condition . The start dose 30 mg . The dose Cohorts 2 6 determine base data collect previous cohort . The study population MRD consist 32 participant enrol 4 cohort . Each cohort 8 randomized participant , 6 receive one dose TAK-915 Day 1 daily dose Days 8-14 , 2 receive match placebo fast condition . The dose cohort Part 2 determine base data collect complete SRD cohort study . The study population DDI consist 12 participant enrol 1 cohort . All participant receive one dose TAK-915 Day 3 daily dose Days 10-16 fasted condition . All participant also receive single dose Midazolam 2 mg Day 1 Day 16 . The dose TAK-915 cohort determine base data collect SRD cohort dose administer MRD Cohort 8 . The study population BA/FE consist 12 participant enrol 1 cohort . TAK-915 administer 3 single-dose regimen 3-way crossover design use 50 mg oral dose treatment ( Regimen A : TAK915 50 mg oral suspension formulation fast state ; Regimen B : TAK-915 50 tablet formulation fat state ; Regimen C : TAK-915 50 tablet formulation fat state ) . TAK-915 dose occur Day 1 treatment period follow 14 day washout period . The study population ESSD consist 8 elderly participant ( age 65-75 year ) enrol 1 cohort . All 8 participant receive single dose TAK-915 50 mg suspension fast condition . This single-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 70 day . Participants make multiple visit clinic include period confinement clinic contact telephone 12 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
