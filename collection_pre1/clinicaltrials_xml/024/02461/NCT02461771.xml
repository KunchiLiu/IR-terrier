	<criteria>1 . Male Female 2 . Age ≥ 50 year 3 . The presence active choroidal neovascular lesion secondary AMD 4 . On treatment antiVEGF therapy ( Lucentis® , Eylea® Avastin® ) 5 . Must receive least 3 antiVEGF treatment 26week period prior screen ( Screening Visit ) 6 . Evidence macular fluid respond antiVEGF past base OCT opinion PI 7 . At screening , evidence subretinal fluid retinal cystic change 8 . Must receive antiVEGF treatment within 10 day prior APL2 treatment ( antiVEGF administer day screen visit screening procedure complete ) 9 . OCTs sufficient quality allow assessment central macular fluid obtain 10 . Female subject must : Women nonchildbearing potential ( WONCBP ) , Or Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) negative pregnancy test screening must agree use protocol define method contraception duration study 11 . Males female partner childbearing potential must agree use protocol define method contraception agree refrain donate sperm duration study 12 . Willing able give inform consent 1 . Choroidal neovascularization associate ocular disease pathologic myopia , ocular histoplasmosis posterior uveitis , etc 2 . Decreased vision due retinal disease attributable choroidal neovascularization , nonexudative form AMD , geographic atrophy , inherit retinal dystrophy , uveitis epiretinal membrane , vitelliformlike lesion outer retina ( e.g. , pattern dystrophy basal laminar drusen ) , idiopathic parafoveal telangiectasis , central serous retinopathy 3 . Additional ocular disease irreversibly compromise , followup , could likely compromise VA study eye include amblyopia , anterior ischemic optic neuropathy , clinically significant diabetic macular edema , severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy , proliferative diabetic retinopathy 4 . Decreased vision due significant medium opacity corneal disease cataract , opacity preclude photography retina 5 . Cataract surgery within three month enrollment 6 . Presence hemorrhage 7 . History treatment CNV : 1 . Previous PDT treatment within 30 day prior enrollment study 2 . Previous extrafoveal juxtafoveal thermal laser photocoagulation within 30 day prior enrollment study 8 . Intraocular surgery ( include lens replacement surgery ) within 3 month prior randomization 9 . Medical problem make consistent followup treatment period unlikely ( e.g . stroke , severe MI , end stage malignancy ) , general poor medical risk systemic disease active uncontrolled infection 10 .
