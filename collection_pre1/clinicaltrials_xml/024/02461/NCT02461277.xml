	<detailed_description>Fast track program represent new approach management patient undergo surgery . It perioperative care pathway design achieve early recovery help minimize postoperative morbidity mortality . These multimodal approach focus enhance recovery reduce surgical stress minimal invasive surgery , optimize pain relief , early nutrition ambulation . In postoperative , bed rest lead increase muscle loss weakness , impairs pulmonary function , predispose venous stasis thromboembolism , increase infection complication reduce functional capacity . However , information result Fast-track protocols functional capacity exercise hospital stay sparse . The six-minute walk test use measure functional capacity exercise different population detect change intervention . The distance travel two six-minute walk test ( preoperative postoperative ) compare two group ( Fast-track Conventional ) . In trial investigator consider Fast-track protocol feasible enhance functional capacity exercise thoracic surgery .</detailed_description>
