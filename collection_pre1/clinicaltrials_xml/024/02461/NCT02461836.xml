	<brief_title>Study Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Patients After Radical Resection Pancreatic Cancer With Advanced Stages ( T3 N1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer one deadly tumor type alimentary system . Despite dramatic progress diagnostic method surgical technics , overall 5-year survival still around 5 % . Resection curable method treat pancreatic cancer , although small proportion patient eligible operation . However , even radical resection achieve , 5-year survival rate 15-20 % . The main cause death tumor recurrence , high 50-70 % 3 year operation . By , widely accept pancreatic cancer systemic disease . Systemic treatment recommend neoadjuvant adjuvant manner . It 's report adjuvant radiation prolong survival improve quality life surgery , especially patient undergo R1 ( microscopic positive margin ) R2 ( macroscopic positive margin ) resection . For R0 ( microscopic negative margin ) resection patient advanced stage ( T3 N1 ) , value adjuvant radiation still debate . Some argues adjuvant radiation radical resection make effect prevent local recurrence metastasis may impair patient ' quality life overall survival . On contrary , researcher draw conclusion adjuvant radiation may facilitate local control tumor recurrence small cohort . It 's warrant explore role adjuvant radiation patient radical resection pancreatic cancer advance stage ( T3 N1 ) large , prospective , randomized cohort . Traditionally , radiation may take one month deliver dosage restrict prevent damage surround tissue . The size effect duration impair patient ' compliance . Recently , application Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) make radiation less harmful flexible . The advantage SBRT high dosage radiation , less damage surround organ , significant reduce duration . To knowledge , big randomize clinical trial evaluate value SBRT patient radical resection pancreatic cancer advance stage ( T3 N1 ) . It hop adjuvant SBRT may benefit post-operative patient advance stage one day adjuvant SBRT combine chemotherapy become standard care pancreatic cancer patient .</detailed_description>
