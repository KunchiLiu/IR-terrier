	<brief_title>Evaluation Treatment Algorithm Patients With Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patellofemoral pain syndrome ( PFPS ) account 25 40 % knee pain young active individual . PFPS describe anterior knee pain around patella aggravate activity , particularly activity increase patellofemoral force squat , ascend descend stair , run , jump . It common adolescent physically active adult . Females likely experience PFPS male . PFPS multi-factorial condition clear etiology consider syndrome diagnosis . Dye describe PFPS one difficult orthopedic condition manage . Multiple theory exist regard cause PFPS pain . A primary theory cause PFPS abnormal patellar track result excessive patellofemoral joint compressive force . Many factor contribute abnormal patellar tracking suggest include ; hip quadriceps weakness , delay diminish activation vastus medialis obliquus , increase Q-angle , alter low extremity mechanic decrease low extremity flexibility . Due number suggest contributory factor PFPS pain , vast amount intervention exist frequently use clinician . Although , physical therapy intervention show effective sham intervention , many individual recurrent chronic pain . Ninety-six percent patient report problem four year follow diagnosis PFPS . A possible reason continue pain PFPS multi-factorial condition treatment may address contribute factor individual . If contributing factor patient 's PFPS identify , address factor may best approach . Performing hip strengthen prior quadriceps strengthen result decreased level pain exercise . Individuals reduce flexibility likely impair low extremity mechanic . Performing traditional low extremity strengthen exercise impair low extremity mechanic result increase patellofemoral joint contact force . In attempt well treat individual PFPS , classification system subgroup patient PFPS propose , effectiveness evaluate . An important clinical question classification system patient nicely fit one subgroup . If patient meet meet criteria multiple subgroup , patient treat ? No evidence exist relative frequency patient PFPS fall propose subgroup whether subgroup mutually exclusive . The clinical classification system report literature address physical impairment . Psychosocial factor also identify important treating patient PFPS . In study Piva et al . fear avoidance belief strongest predictor outcome function pain . Mental health status Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 correlate severity patellofemoral symptom athlete . The result study highlight necessity address psychosocial factor treat PFPS . Therefore , author design new classification system ( PFPS algorithm ) subgrouping patient base patient 's clinical presentation . There four subgroup new PFPS algorithm : Fear-Avoidance , Flexibility , Functional Malalignment , Strengthening function progression . The criterion intervention subgroup address sequentially episode care . This classification system aim address problem encounter individual meet criterion multiple subgroup . There also psychosocial component address need individual activity avoidance . The PFPS algorithm goal-based , meet criterion pas subgroup focus treatment . Clinicians provide whichever physical therapy intervention allow individual patient meet criterion subgroup . Interventions use PFPS algorithm base best available evidence , clinician 's experience , patient 's individual response intervention . A pilot study assess feasibility full study assess algorithm effectiveness perform previously study investigator ( IRB13-00749 ) . The primary aim pilot study meet . The therapist clinic personnel successfully work together carry treatment require conduct future full scale randomize controlled trial . The ordered treatment approach use PFPS algorithm , address soft tissue tightness , alter low extremity kinematics , neuromuscular deficit psychosocial factor sequential manor , result clinically significant improvement Anterior Knee Pain Scale Global Rating Change score . With minor change protocol outcome measure use , full randomize controlled trial assess effectiveness PFPS algorithm deem feasible . The primary objective study ass efficacy use sequential treatment approach treat patellofemoral pain syndrome . Patient randomize one two treatment group ; either PFPS algorithm control group impairment base approach . Impairment Based Approach : The control group impairment base approach treatment focus impairment find evaluation lower quarter . The evaluation lower quarter assess motion , flexibility , strength body mechanic . The joint low quarter include lumbar spine , hip , knee , ankle foot . Specific attention pay quadriceps hip strength , hip knee flexibility , squat , jumping , walk run mechanic . Treatment consist 2 visit per week 6 week . Treatments last 45-60 minute . Exercises give patient perform home therapist discretion . Interventions individualized patient therapist 's discretion . Therapists use treatment include limited : exercise , manual therapy , tap bracing , orthotics , modality , education . Home exercise give therapist discretion consistent standard care . PFPS treatment algorithm : The PFPS treatment algorithm objective goal drive treatment program . Treatment therapist discretion objective meet requirement subgroup . Evidence literature guide treatment best meet goal . The first group within classification system Fear Avoidance , research show change fear-avoidance belief physical activity one best predictor improve functional outcome . The second group Flexibility . This second group system research show patient decreased flexibility unable properly perform functional malalignment test . Also quadriceps length gastrocnemius/soleus length strongly associate PFPS . The third group Functional Malalignment . This group assess patient 's form functional task . If patient demonstrates impaired mechanic , time spent strengthen motor control patient able strengthen return full function proper technique . The final group Strengthening/Return Function . This group work strengthen low quarter muscle particular attention quadriceps , hip abductor external rotators . This also time progress patient back sport functional activity . -Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire ( A score 15 great questionnaire result give PFPS fear avoidance booklet treatment use Cognitive Behavioral emphasis ) Primary Muscle Flexibility Requirements ( Not meet 1 flexibility measure result place flexibility subgroup ) - Quadriceps ≥ 130 degree - Gastrocnemius ≥ 12 degree - Soleus ≥ 20 degree - Weight Bearing Dorsiflexion ≥ 48 degree Secondary Muscle Flexibility ( Having tightness least 3 follow test result place flexibility subgroup ) - Thomas test - Ober 's Test - Hamstring Straight Leg Raise ≥ 80 degree - Adductor Flexibility Functional Malalignment ( Score great 1 result place functional malalignment subgroup ) - Lateral Step Down test - Single Leg Squat test Strengthening/Functional Progression ( A limb symmetry index score &gt; =90 % test use determine adequate LE strength function ) - Single Hop Test - Triple Hop Test - Crossover Hop Distance test - Timed Step Down test</detailed_description>
