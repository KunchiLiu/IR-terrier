	<brief_summary>Flexors tendon injury frequent serious potential definitive functional aftereffect . In case partial injury , treatment debate . There 2 technique possible repair , direct suture tangential resection . The investigator already demonstrate last technique favorable injury go 50 % . In case partial section 50 75 % , investigator think technique tangential resection compare direct suture would increase risk secondary break , would authorize even immediate mobilization would decrease secondary complication . The main objective highlight tangential resection lower classic technique clinical plan The secondary objective highlight non-inferiority tangential technique clinical term ( pain , dexterity , complication ) , radiologics ( MRI , ultrasound ) functional ( function , go back leisures professional activity )</brief_summary>
