	<brief_title>A National Registry For Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAP rare syndrome surfactant accumulation result hypoxemic respiratory failure occur number disease classify pathogenically three group : primary PAP ( cause disruption GM-CSF signal - autoimmune PAP , hereditary PAP ) , secondary PAP ( cause reduction alveolar macrophage number and/or function ) , surfactant dysfunction-related PAP ( cause mutation gene require normal surfactant production ) . In current clinical practice , PAP diagnose base lung biopsy ; approach able identify PAP-causing disease anyone . Current therapy involve physical removal surfactant procedure lung repeatedly fill saline empty - whole lung lavage , invasive , inefficient , widely available , especially child . Importantly , research advance elucidate pathogenesis disease cause PAP patient identify new diagnostic therapeutic approach . Simple blood-based research test identify PAP-causing disease 95 % patient . Further , several promise potential disease-specific therapy currently development . The long-term goal Rare Lung Diseases Consortium include improve diagnosis therapy people PAP . A major goal protocol establish National PAP Registry . Our central hypothesis nationwide campaign enroll communicate large cohort PAP patient important benefit include 1 ) accelerate translation research diagnostics clinical practice , 2 ) increase knowledge among patient healthcare community PAP , 3 ) engagement PAP patient doctor plan conduct PAP research . The specific objective study : 1 ) determine ability DBSC GMAb Test correctly identify autoimmune PAP among people PAP type , 2 ) estimate prevalence autoimmune PAP , 3 ) increase communication knowledge PAP-causing disease , PAP research advance , future research study among PAP patient , healthcare provider , medical community , PAP Foundation , Translational Pulmonary Science Center ( TPSC ) general public , 4 ) evaluate ability DBSC-based test correctly identify genetic factor increase risk develop PAP ; 5 ) evaluate ability DBSC GMAb Test correctly identify autoimmune PAP among people PAP type , another lung diseases , healthy control . The target population person diagnose PAP . The study design involve recruitment , screening , enrollment Participants via short telephone-based study visit , completion questionnaire , collection capillary blood fingertip Participants home use DBSC , send US mail TPSC evaluation . The experimental approach compare GMAb level DBSCs Participants diagnose PAP determine fraction autoimmune PAP patient among individual PAP . DBSC-based genetic testing compare current blood-based method identification know genetic risk factor develop PAP . Lastly , DBSC GMAb value compare GMAb value healthy lung disease control determine ability DBSC GMAb test identify patient autoimmune PAP . Anticipated result establish National PAP registry , validate test diagnosis disease cause PAP 90 % patient , increase awareness understanding PAP among patient healthcare provider , provide patient voice PAP research . These result impact field : 1 ) transform PAP diagnose , 2 ) increase access diagnostic test - special importance remote location , 3 ) engage PAP patient healthcare community plan implement PAP research include prospective natural history study clinical trial evaluate several potential , disease-specific therapy .</detailed_description>
