	<brief_title>Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) Intellectual Disability ( ID ) Determinants Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC ) multi-system disease usually exhibit high variability clinical finding among within family . About 50 % individual TSC develop intellectual disability ( ID ) and/or autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . The purpose research study learn information ASD/ID individual TSC neurobehavioral assessment magnetic resonance image ultimately effective treatment intervention ASD/ID realize . Individuals TSC ask participate study age 3 21 year old diagnose suspect confirmed autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability . Both male female ask participate . Additionally , eligible study participation , individual ' primary communicative language must English . Also , participant least one biological parent ask provide biological specimen include DNA RNA inclusion TSC RDCRN Biorepository . The study involve 5 visit ( 3 site visit ) course two year . Study visit vary length 4 hour 6 hour . Study visit involve physical exam , medical history question neuropsychological assessment . Blood drawn baseline visit DNA RNA study . Individuals TSC annual MRI scan clinically indicate . The clinical scan extend 15 minute part study .</detailed_description>
