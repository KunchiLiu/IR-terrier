	<brief_summary>This study evaluate new treatment combination ixazomib cyclophosphamide dexamethasone relapse refractory multiple myeloma . Participants either receive ixazomib cyclophosphamide dexamethasone cyclophosphamide dexamethasone alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Randomised Trial Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone Combination With Ixazomib Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cyclophosphamide dexamethasone commonly use treatment multiple myeloma often give third drug ( e.g . thalidomide , lenalidomide bortezomib ) . The combination conventional new drug provide benefit overall survival progression free survival , however treatment available patient respond well ( refractory ) previous treatment need treatment myeloma come back ( relapse ) . Thus need new agent patient . The development ixazomib provide opportunity increase anti-tumour activity wider range tumour type . Early clinical trial data suggest anti-tumour activity heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patient durable responses/disease control generally well tolerate . Cyclophosphamide dexamethasone predominantly use treatment multiple myeloma patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) , relapse bortezomib lenalidomide . Therefore evaluation ixazomib combination cyclophosphamide dexamethasone valuable practical option patient . The primary end point study progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Secondary end point include toxicity safety .</detailed_description>
