	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common malignancy world third common cause cancer-related death complicate liver cirrhosis case . In Egypt , remarkable increase proportion HCC among chronic liver disease ( CLD ) patient 4.0 % 7.2 % decade . This rise proportion may explain increase risk factor emergence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) period time , contribution hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection , improvement screen program diagnostic tool HCC well increase survival rate among patient cirrhosis allow time develop HCC . Hepatocellular carcinoma multifactorial etiology complex pathogenesis , blend risk factor differs different part world , may explain part diverse biologic characteristic HCC different population . Exposure aflatoxin additional risk factor development HCC , damage DNA liver cell mutation p53 tumor suppressor gene . A previous study show aflatoxin B1 considerable role development HCC among Egyptians .
