	<brief_summary>Previous data suggest vitamin D level may influence cancer development . In particular , several single nucleotide polymorphism describe Vitamin D receptor ( VDR gene ) , polymorphisms associate tumor occurrence . For instance , VDR polymorphisms relate cancer breast , prostate , skin , colon-rectum , bladder kidney , although conflict observation . VDR polymorphism also investigate context chronic liver disease , chronic hepatitis B , primary biliary cirrhosis autoimmune hepatitis . In recent publish study , VDR polymorphism may use molecular marker predict risk evaluate disease severity HCC patient chronic hepatitis B . A significant association VDR ( ApaI ) polymorphism development HCC chronic HCV infection may help identify high risk develop HCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection one major public health problem worldwide . Chronic HCV infection characterize high rate progression fibrosis , chronic hepatitis , lead cirrhosis ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Early detection critically important effective treatment HCC surgical resection ablation therapy tumour small . On hand , genetic factor also contribute , particularly gene polymorphisms inflammatory cytokine growth factor ligands receptor . Vitamin D involve metabolism skeleton systemic hormone also important role regulation host immune response , fibrogenesis development cancer vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) .
