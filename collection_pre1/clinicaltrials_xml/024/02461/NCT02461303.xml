	<brief_summary>Klinefelter syndrome characterize primary testicular failure progressive infertility . The objective study determine sperm present observe urine semen sample adolescent young adult Klinefelter patient determine whether presence sperm correlate physical and/or clinically obtain hormone measure pubertal development . This study design order answer follow question : 1 . Is possible observe sperm urine sample adolescent young adult Klinefelter patient ? 2 . Is possible retrieve sperm cryopreservation semen sample adolescent young adult Klinefelter patient ? 3 . Does presence sperm correlate physical and/or endocrine measure assess routine clinical evaluation pubertal development KS patient population ? 4 . If sperm retrieval possible , optimal age sperm retrieval attempt ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Klinefelter Syndrome ( KS ) genetic condition boy men result two X chromosome one Y chromosome . The incidence 47 , XXY karyotype defines disorder range 1:500 1:1000 newborn male . The sexual development fertility phenotypes Klinefelter 's syndrome include azoospermia ( absence sperm ejaculate ) , small firm testes , gynaecomastia ( enlargement breast tissue ) , low testosterone level , elevate follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) luteinizing hormone ( LH ) level important impact quality life patient . Beginning puberty , testicular biopsy Klinefelter patient progressively show degenerated testicular environment Sertoli-cell-only tubule , sclerotic hyalinized tubule , interstitial Leydig cell hyperplasia . Nevertheless , scatter area focal spermatogenesis see Klinefelter men , assist reproductive technique offer hope patient wish father biological child . In case , surgical sperm recovery procedure call testicular sperm extraction ( TESE ) perform extract sperm vitro reproductive method . Success rate testicular sperm extraction Klinefelter patient consistently 50 % ( 50 - 72 % ) similar success rate report TESE azoospermic patient without Klinefelter syndrome . Pregnancy rate life birth intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) similar couple without KS , baby father KS patient normal karyotype . Previous study adult KS patient report sperm recovery rate significantly low age 35 . Therefore , suggest surgical sperm recovery younger ( possibly pubertal ) boys consider option maximize opportunity preserve fertility become sterile . However , considerable debate benefit early invasive fertility intervention KS patient . The standard , non-invasive safe way obtain analyze sperm production quality normal post-pubertal male obtain semen sample masturbation . It currently unknown spermatogenesis start boy KS , sperm could detect semen analysis early puberty . In proposal , investigator aim determine non-invasive method puberty could useful assess reproductive potential KS patient , possibly cryopreserve sperm patient future use well-established assisted reproductive technique like vitro fertilization ICSI ( intra cytoplasmic sperm injection ) . Although sensitive topic adolescent patient KS parent , essential begin conversation regard fertility preservation . Indeed , parent patient question regard future fertility . This study secondary benefit provide ideal opportunity educate affect male family long-term effect KS fertility availability reproductive technology help fertility . Similar discussion become increasingly common ( standard care ) cancer patient risk infertility due disease oncologic treatment . It currently unknown spermatogenesis start boy KS . While seem commonly accept progressive depletion germ cell testes KS patient onset puberty , data support notion equivocal due small patient population , lack control absence longitudinal data . In addition , standard therapy boys KS testosterone replacement therapy trigger entry progression puberty characterize development secondary sexual characteristic , bone maturation , continue linear growth . However , testosterone supplementation also suppress spermatogenesis ( present ) negative feedback hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis . Some argue intervention preserve fertility KS patient ideally precede hormone replacement therapy . However , one study propose topical testosterone therapy might negatively affect spermatogenesis adolescent KS patient . The risk unknowns invasive surgical procedure like TESE boy carefully weigh possible benefit unique patient population . For reason , investigator propose non-invasive method would appropriate retrieve sperm essential gain insight initiation decline spermatogenesis KS patient . In study , investigator analyse sperm find urine and/or semen Klinefelter patient puberty early adulthood . Participants follow reach age 26 . During time study participation , participant provide urine sample and/or semen sample two time year . This scheduled time routine visit patient 's endocrinologist .</detailed_description>
