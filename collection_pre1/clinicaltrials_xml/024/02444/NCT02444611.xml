	<brief_summary>Neonatal morbidity mortality infectious disease global concern . Childhood disease-specific immunisation irrefutably link decline death target infection last century . However , neonatal immunisation limit , part , impaired adaptive immune function age group . There expand body evidence heterologous ( 'non-specific ' ) effect various vaccine use childhood . This refer immunomodulatory capability vaccine influence immune outcomes beyond vaccine 's specific targeted disease . The underlying immunological mechanism responsible effect incompletely understood , evidence mount innate immune system central observed effect . This study randomise control trial design determine influence two commonly administer neonatal immunisation , BCG Hepatitis B vaccine , give birth , neonatal immune response non-specific antigen . The investigator recruit 200 newborn Mercy Hospital Women Melbourne , Australia 1-year period . These baby allocate randomly one 4 group , receive 2 vaccine different combination , 2 set time point . ( birth 1 week post randomisation ) A blood sample take 1-week post randomisation vitro immunological analysis . This study improve current understanding influence vaccine neonatal immunity help develop strategy exploit beneficial heterologous ( 'non-specific ' ) effect improve protection infection young .</brief_summary>
