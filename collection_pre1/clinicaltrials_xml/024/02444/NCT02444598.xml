	<brief_title>Trial Negative-pressure Wound Therapy Use Conflict-related Extremity Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial location : Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) one worlds lead independent organization medical humanitarian aid . MSF conduct emergency trauma project Ministry Health hospital Ar Ramtha , Jordan , less five kilometer border Daraa governorate Syria . A majority patient within project receive treatment blast- gunshot-related trauma wound originate Syrian arm conflict . Within project wound management difficult , often complicate infection antibiotic resistance . A need wound therapy alternative well conventional wound dress method currently use identify . Background : Extremity wound fracture constitute majority war-associated traumatic injury , civilian ( Aboutanos &amp; Baker 1997 ) combatant ( Owens et al . 2007 ) . Conflict-related injury often result soft boney tissue contaminate foreign material , generally lead secondary infection ( Fares et al . 2013 ; Covey et al . 2000 ) . Negative-pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) widely use treatment wound consider promote wound heal prevent infectious complication . The technique involve application wound dress negative pressure apply . Any wound tissue fluid draw away area collect canister . The risk wound contamination reduce plastic film overlay wound . NPWT support use range surgical application , include debridement bridge definite closure soft tissue wound ( Krug et al . 2011 ) . The technique previously use treatment acute conflict-related wound satisfactory result ( Machen 2006 ; Peck et al . 2007 ; Leininger et al . 2006 ) . Cochrane review NPWT treatment chronic wound ( Ubbink et al . 2008 ) surgical wound ( Webster &amp; Scuffham 2014 ) inconclusive due lack suitably power , high-quality trial . A recent systematic review randomize , control trial ( RCTs ) NPWT treatment acute chronic wound conclude lack evidence good RCTs need ( Peinemann &amp; Sauerland 2011 ) . For use limb trauma , NPWT consider suitable complex soft tissue injury ( Bovill et al . 2008 ) . NPWT appear effective safe adjunctive treatment high-energy combat wound exist result retrospective lack follow-up ( Hinck et al . 2010 ) . The support RCTs need establish best treatment strategy . Summary potential risk benefit : Both treatment method ( NPWT conventional dressing ) well establish use Jordan treatment acute chronic wound . As neither two treatment modality know well term outcome neither patient group may regard receive preferential treatment . NPWT generally consider safe treatment method . Potential benefit shorten healing time fewer infectious complication . Potential risk pain , mainly associate dressing change ( Krasner 2002 ) bleeding , predominantly minor bleed granulation tissue ( Argenta , Louis Morykwas 1997 ) . Conventional wound dress potential benefit safe treatment method use many year . Since method permit air wound potential risk contamination development wound infection . Objectives : We aim evaluate efficacy safety NPWT treatment traumatic extremity wound context associate high level contamination infection . Design : A prospective , randomize , control trial compare NPWT conventional dress method treatment conflict-related extremity wound . Patients continuously include present emergency department hospital Ar Ramtha . Information patient consent : Written oral information English Arabic give eligible participant . English version participation information sheet consent form provide appendix document . Participants inform regard right withdraw study issue concern confidentiality information sheet remain participant . No incentives inducement provide participant . Eligible concomitant therapy : Any sign infection treat accord local standard protocol . Wounds need debridement debrided accord International Committee Red Cross ( ICRC ) war surgery protocol . Interventions : Patients randomly assign NPWT receive treatment accord manufacturer treatment guideline . Patients control group treat conventional wound therapy accord local treatment protocol . In group dress change perform accord ICRC war surgery protocol .</detailed_description>
