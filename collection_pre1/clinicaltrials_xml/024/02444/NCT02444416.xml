	<brief_summary>Context : Heart failure associate high morbidity mortality rate represent significant worldwide public health burden . In European country , total amount expense related heart failure represent 1 2 % total health budget 75 % spent hospitalization , make heart failure expensive pathology cardiology . Acute heart failure ( AHF ) poor prognosis despite improvement therapy . Hospital mortality 2 4 % risk death readmission six month follow hospitalization high . Patients hospitalized heart failure represent heterogeneous population term etiology , clinical presentation and/or co-morbidities . Consequently , implies variable outcome term morbidity mortality , probably due different prognostic factor . The precise spectrum etiology prognostic factor AHF non select population exhaustively study predictive model concern AHF validate . Ischemic heart disease , valvulopathy , arrhythmia , infection , hypertension lack therapeutic compliance often quote factor trigger heart failure . Some trigger factor ( ischemic heart disease , pulmonary infection , acute renal failure ) seem strongly associate poor prognosis term hospital/out-patient mortality re-hospitalization rate . The complex relation heart failure acute renal failure define cardio-renal syndrome . Thirty percent patient hospitalize AHF diagnose acute renal failure admission worsen kidney failure hospitalization . It seem heart failure cardio-renal syndrome two distinct entity different prognosis . The type acute renal failure ( functional , renal post-renal ) patient prognostic value etiology still firmly establish . A thorough determination etiology prognostic factor AHF necessary order allow identification high-risk patient improvement heart failure management . Objectives : - To create observational registry patient hospitalize AHF - To determine precise prevalence etiology prognostic factor AHF non select population . Among prognostic factor , establish specific role acute renal failure - To establish optimal initial assessment patient hospitalize heart failure - To validate compare prospective data result retrospective cohort study carry University Hospital Geneva establish re-hospitalization mortality outcome patient hospitalize heart failure . Method : Creation observational registry associate biobank include patient hospitalize AHF Department General Internal medicine ( SMIG ) Departments Specialties University Hospital Geneva . Anticipated result : - To identify prevalence etiology prognostic factor heart failure - To establish optimal initial assessment patient hospitalize heart failure . Among prognostic factor , establish specific role acute renal failure - To validate compare result retrospective cohort study carry University Hospital Geneva establish re-hospitalization mortality outcome patient hospitalize AHF - To improve management hospitalized patient AHF robust identification etiology well identification high-risk patient .</brief_summary>
