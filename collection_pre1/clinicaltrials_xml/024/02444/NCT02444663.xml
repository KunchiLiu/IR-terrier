	<detailed_description>X-rays frequently use image test evaluate knee joint replacement . They non-invasive , safe cost effective . They allow assessment : progression disease , appropriateness joint replacement ( particular unicompartmental knee replacement ( UKR ) ) well likely prognosis follow replacement . Currently standard assessment involve : standing anteroposterior , lateral skyline X-ray view . In addition patient consider joint replacement valgus/varus stress X-rays use evaluate lateral compartment ( well medial collateral ligament ) medial compartment respectively assess status cartilage . The assessment pattern severity disease critical evaluate suitability joint replacement well decide total knee replacement ( TKR ) , articulate surface replace , UKR , diseased portion joint replace . Understanding pattern disease essential ensure appropriate patient selection UKR , appropriate half patient undergoing knee replacement , significant benefit TKR include : half risk venous thromboembolism , myocardial infarction deep infection , two third risk stroke , one quarter risk blood transfusion significantly low mortality eight year follow operation . Stress X-rays currently perform clinician , require attend radiology , often clinic . To perform stress view clinician fix knee move tibia away midline , valgus stress , X-ray take . The alignment view confirm tibia move towards midline , varus stress , another X-ray take . Stress X-rays resource dependent time consume . In addition , technique uncomfortable patient well result additional radiation exposure clinical practitioner . On average , knee surgeon may expose excess 300 exposure every year cumulative effect radiation exposure significant . As many center stress view often perform , stand antero-posterior X-ray view inadequate assess disease severity pattern many clinician adopt additional imaging modality MRI direct observation via arthroscopy evaluate status cartilage compartment . The use additional imaging technique introduces significant additional cost well delays treatment . Furthermore long term outcome UKR establish use stress view , consequence outcome base MRI arthroscopic finding fully establish . A patient user friendly device perform valgus varus stress X-rays knee diagnostic pre-operative planning purpose set knee replacement surgery develop . This device potential benefit patient allow accurate assessment pattern severity arthritis affect knee without need additional diagnostics MRI arthroscopy . Furthermore healthcare practitioner provider device facilitate smooth run clinic reduce additional clinic appointment require review MRI result . Ultimately device allow informed discussion treatment option , reduce pre-operative uncertainty suitability UKR undergoing surgery ensure patient suitable UKR benefit procedure . This device help ensure patient receive optimum treatment clinically cost efficient manner . This study validate valgus varus stress X-rays perform use investigator ' device gold standard clinician perform manual stress .</detailed_description>
