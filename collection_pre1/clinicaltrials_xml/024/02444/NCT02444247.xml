	<detailed_description>This investigation address increase physical activity yield empirical evidence inform developing tool help individual make healthy choice regard physical activity ( PA ) maintenance healthy body weight . Behavioral Choice Theory provide framework understanding choice people make shift individual 's choice toward healthy alternative . The theory hold choice base relative motivating value alternative . One way shift choice toward healthy alternative increase relative reinforce value ( RRV ) , motivate value , alternative . Thus , increase RRV PA behavior could shift choice towards PA away less healthy , sedentary alternative . Increasing RRV PA may allow PA compete reinforcing , sedentary behavior , result shift behavioral choice . This process term `` incentive sensitization '' , originally propose explain drug addiction . Incentive Sensitization theory posit RRV behavior increase repeated exposure , produce neuroadaptations increase crave behavior - repeat exposure stimulus , 'sensitization ' hypersensitivity incentive motivational effect stimulus follow . Another factor influence motivation behavior development tolerance unpleasant aspect behavior . Opponent-Process Theory would account acquisition motif initial reinforcer may negative - affect experience repeated exposure opposite experience first presentation . For exercise , would include tolerance discomfort , pain , fatigue displeasure great positive post-exercise affective response : affect experience exercise great motivational significance PA participation knowledge belief regard health benefit . Therefore , investigator propose repeat exposure PA produce tolerance unpleasant aspect increase post-exercise affect . Sensitizing PA reinforcement increase discomfort tolerance may associate increase duration intensity daily activity . There likely individual difference sensitization PA reinforcement development discomfort tolerance . Single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) alter dopamine tone central dopaminergic reward system SNPs associate alter pain perception may contribute individual difference . The investigator anticipate moderate PA dose ( 300 kilocalorie [ kcal ] expenditure ) produce great incentive sensitization tolerance low dose ( 150 kcal ) SNPs related central dopamine tone pain perception may contribute individual difference incentive sensitization change physical activity repeat exposure physical activity .</detailed_description>
