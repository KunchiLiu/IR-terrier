	<detailed_description>The Police Education Program ( PEP ) evaluation component , title Proyecto ESCUDO ( Project SHIELD ) . This project follow aim : 1 ) To evaluate efficacy PEP uptake occupational safety procedure , assess incidence occupational needle-stick injury ( NSI ) ( primary outcome ) , monitor department-wide NSI surveillance program , self-reported NSI ; 2 ) To evaluate efficacy PEP change follow secondary outcome : ) knowledge transmission , prevention treatment HIV related infection ( sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) viral hepatitis ) ; ii ) attitudes towards people inject drug ( PWID ) ; iii ) adverse behavior interfere HIV prevention ( i.e. , arrest near syringe exchange program ( SEP ) drug treatment location ) ; iv ) protective behavior ( e.g. , use barrier protection , self-reported reduction syringe confiscation ) . 3 ) To assess potential mediating moderate factor influence PEP efficacy , include change knowledge attitudinal factor occupational construct . The investigator hypothesize , course 24-month follow-up , PEP associate significant decline NSI incidence , improve knowledge HIV related infection , uptake occupational safety measure , decrease behavior undermine HIV prevention ( e.g . syringe confiscation , police harassment PWID opioid substitution therapy ( OST ) SEPs ) . Hypotheses : H1 . The PEP associate significant decline NSI incidence among force follow-up . H2.1 . The PEP associate significantly increase knowledge transmission , prevention treatment HIV HCV among Tijuana police officer participate sub-cohort . H2.2 . The PEP associate significant improvement attitude towards PWID , sex worker HIV-infected person . H2.3 . The PEP associate significantly few report syringe confiscation police officer . H2.4 . The PEP associate low incidence arrest near SEP drug treatment location . H2.5 The PEP associate increase use barrier protection pat-downs arrest . H2.6 . The PEP associate increase knowledge narcomenudeo drug policy reform . H3.1 The impact PEP NSI incidence adverse protective behavior moderate officer ' motivation undergo training , year force , autonomous support receive supervisor . Conceptual Framework PEP : The trans-contextual Model ( TCM ) successfully use evaluate injury prevention PEPs international setting ( Chung-Chan Hagger 2012 ) . The investigator apply TCM conceptualize assess mechanism PEP impact occupational safety officer ' behavior . This model incorporate key theoretical construct self-determination theory ( SDT ) ( Deci Ryan 2000 ) theory plan behavior ( TPB ) ( Ajzen 1991 ) . TPB emphasize role psychosocial factor affect decision making process translate change behavior . Herein , factor include trainee attitude , subjective norm , self-efficacy , intention . These TPB construct robust predictive value realm injury prevention ( Sheeran Silverman 2003 , Lajunen Rasanen 2004 ) . SDT highlight role motivation perceive autonomy `` regulator '' may mediate impact train initiative trainee practice adherence . Perceived support supervisor ( autonomy support ) injury prevention ( Chan , Lonsdale et al . 1977 ) motivation participate educational intervention know antecedent change behavioral corollary endpoint ( Standage , Duda et al . 2005 ) . Validated realm occupational safety injury prevention ( Chan Hagger 2012 , Hagger Chatzisarantis 2012 ) , TCM base complex interplay SDT TPB factor shape impact educational intervention ( Chung-Chan Hagger 2012 ) . The TCM model also suggest change self-efficacy produce training transfer domain related , serve focus training intervention ( Chung-Chan Hagger 2012 ) . Herein , TCM elucidate pathway PEP may shift ancillary police activity , include adherence departmental procedure drug policy ( e.g . target PWID enforcement activity seek access SEPs OST ) . These shift may improve police occupational safety reduce prevalence adverse encounter PWID , may also collateral population health benefit reduce risk behavior infectious disease incidence among PWID . TCM widely use context physical education training ( Hagger , Chatzisarantis et al . 2003 , Hagger , Chatzisarantis et al . 2005 , Pihu , Hein et al . 2008 , Hagger , Chatzisarantis et al . 2009 ) , research police occupational health , use assessment PEP focus NSI prevention innovative ( Chung-Chan Hagger 2012 ) . PEP Intervention : Based best practice establish Beletsky et al ( Davis Beletsky 2009 , Beletsky , Agrawal et al . 2011 , Silverman , Davis et al . 2012 , Beletsky , Thomas et al . 2013 ) , active input Instituto de Capacitacion Adiestramiento Profesional ( ICAP , Tijuana Police Academy ) instructional expert , investigator culturally linguistically adapt exist PEP material bundle occupational safety information content address legal , scientific , logistical underpinnings HIV prevention . Through train-the-trainer workshop , investigator prepare ICAP instructor build knowledge , pedagogical skill capacity , emphasis peer-to-peer perspective maximize uptake ( Davis Beletsky 2009 ) . An initial team three train ICAP instructor deliver standardize curriculum slide-assisted oral presentation one-hour section ( i.e . module ) , offer consecutively single session . The entire training last approximately three-and-a-half hour . The entire police force mandate periodic refresher training assign class receive one PEP course 2 year . Study Design : ESCUDO Hybrid Type 2 design simultaneously test intervention implementation strategy ( Curran , Bauer et al . 2012 ) . This study three level : 1 ) Implementation PEP across entire Tijuana police department use step wedge design , evaluate department-wide NSI incidence primary study outcome ; 2 ) Prospective 24-month follow-up random sub-cohort police officer sample PEP class ass behavioral outcome ; 3 ) Simultaneous longitudinal follow-up parallel cohort PWID independently assess experience police . Each component describe . Level 1 : Implementation PEP across Tijuana Police Department . ESCUDO initially conceive modified stepped-wedge randomize control trial involve stagger roll-out PEP participant randomly select transition control intervention class equal number two year period . However , since randomly assign officer PEP class would interfere department 's programmatic priority , investigator modify design integrate PEP regularly schedule refresher train class hold purpose ( e.g. , basic police tactic ) . The design investigator adopt maintains core feature step wedge design , whereby pre-intervention period officer treat control . On weekly basis , one cluster ( i.e. , class 20-50 officer different rank precinct undergo regularly schedule refresher train ) 'step ' cross control intervention condition receive PEP training , entire force 1200 street-level officer train . Incidence NSIs ( primary outcome , Aim 1 ) incidence arrest near SEPs drug treatment program ( secondary outcome , Aim 2 ) , assess entire police department base de-identified data . The primary endpoint Proyecto ESCUDO NSI incidence ( Aim 1 ) . Since NSIs tend under-reported , investigator collect data two way : 1 ) Through NSI Surveillance Response Program ( NSRP ) base prospective data entire police department ( Level 1 ) ; 2 ) Through ESCUDO sub-cohort ( N=500 ; Level 2 ; see ) . The first approach utilizes NSRP implement 2014 team collaboration Police Department Office Municipal Health ( DMS ) Tijuana . The NSRP encourage officer experience NSI notify direct supervisor immediately go main office DMS Department Legal Medical Experts . These staffed 24-hours day certify medical doctor private medical exam room complete NSI Exposure Report Form detail circumstance exposure . To facilitate reporting NSIs , Tijuana police car sticker outline NSI protocol , State Ministry Health Office Tijuana make free HIV , Hepatitis C , syphilis Hepatitis B test available site . NSI form keep locked cabinet site ; Head Planning Special Projects Tijuana 's Police Department provide quarterly report team Data Safety Monitoring Board include date NSI , whether officer undergone PEP , date training , context NSI . No identifier include . Survey Data : Police officer consent ESCUDO give pre post-PEP survey self-administered . Each survey take 10-15 minute complete . The survey assess lifetimes recent on-duty NSIs ( Aim 1 ) , knowledge , attitude , subjective norm , intention , self-efficacy adopt protective behavior adverse protective behavior affect NSIs acquisition HIV blood-borne infection ( Aim 2 ) . The survey adapt item previously use Beletsky et al . domestic international setting ( Davis Beletsky 2009 , Beletsky , Agrawal et al . 2011 , Beletsky , Thomas et al . 2013 ) , pilot Tijuana . Since knowledge HIV/AIDS Tijuana low ( Robertson , Ojeda et al . 2012 ) , investigator utilize 18-item , true/false scale ass awareness HIV symptom , transmission , prevention ( e.g. , `` People infected HIV quickly show serious sign illness '' ) ( Carey Schroder 2002 ) . The investigator use scale Tijuana study ( α = 0.75 0.89 ; test-retest reliability= 0.76 0.94 ) . Attitudinal , subjective ( perceive social ) norm , self-efficacy , intention item develop Fisher Fisher assess use 5-item Likert scale ( Strongly agree-strongly disagree ) ( Fisher , Fisher et al . 1994 ) . Items express positive negative statement like `` Syringe Exchange Programs increase risk needle-stick injury police '' ass attitude vulnerable group . For subjective norm , statement like `` colleague think 's important follow official search safety procedure '' utilize . Self-efficacy preventive behavior assess item like `` I confident I prevent on-duty NSIs . '' To assess intended practice , investigator utilize item `` Next time suspect informs syringe , I confiscate . '' These domain consistent central tenet TPB ( Ajzen 1991 ) . SDT highlight importance motivational regulation autonomy support evaluate training intervention . To measure motivational construct , investigator adopt item Perceived Locus Causality scale corollary amotivation subscale ( Goudas , Biddle et al . 1994 ) . Items use stem , ' I participate training : ' list 4 item per scale . Measures include 'trainings interest fun ' ( intrinsic motivation ; α =.88 ) , 'because occupational safety important ' ( identify regulation ) , 'because I require ' ( external regulation ; α =.81 ) , 'but I interest topic ' ( amotivation ; α =.84 ) ( Standage , Duda et al . 2005 ) . Support measure base diverse training intervention evaluation research , include Spanish-speaking setting ( Goudas , Biddle et al . 1994 , Ntoumanis 2001 , Otis Pelletier 2005 , Standage , Duda et al . 2005 , Moreno , Cervello et al . 2007 ) . Autonomy support supervisor measure use adaptation Health Care Climate Questionnaire ( Baard , Deci et al . 2004 ) , use analogous Likert framework series item : `` My supervisor understands '' ( α=.92 ) . Use measure support prior research injury prevention among police ( Chung-Chan Hagger 2012 ) . Geo-coded Arrest Data : In addition NSI surveillance data , Tijuana police department provide team geo-coded arrest data determine extent PEP decrease number arrest near SEP OST sit Tijuana ( Aim 2 ) . Based methodology develop preliminary study ( Brouwer , Rusch et al . 2012 ) , investigator examine spatial overlap drug-related arrest SEPs/drug treatment site use data map GIS-based software , ArcMap 10.1 ( ESRI , Redlands , CA ) . Available drug possession arrest data include arrest ≥1 charge concerned drug possession legal limit , drug-related crime , neighborhood ( colonia ) arrest occur month arrest . Using Getis-Ord Gi* statistic , investigator examine spatial pattern identify hotspot drug-related arrest colonia-level per 1000 adult resident ( e.g. , neighborhood significantly high low rate arrest expect arrest randomly distribute across space ) . The investigator determine whether high rate drug-related arrest colonias well access SEPs/OST site . Access SEPs/drug treatment site determine apply method propose Cooper et al ( Cooper , des Jarlais et al . 2011 ) calculate percent colonia 's surface area within 1350m radius SEP/drug treatment site ( 1350m buffer zone correspond median area colonias Tijuana ) . Colonias surface area within buffer zone define access . Further , investigator examine whether significant increase average number arrest colonias great surface area within buffer zone modeling relationship use Poisson regression . Level 2 : Aim 2 Proyecto ESCUDO determine whether PEP change police behavior . Therefore , investigator assess self-reported NSIs , change attitude HIV related infection , attitude towards PWID , adverse protective behavior influence blood-borne transmission risk among police PWID secondary outcome among sub-cohort police officer sample PEP class . Specifically , begin PEP session , staff explain class police officer PEP train mandatory , ESCUDO evaluation voluntary . Officers wish participate tell submit blank pre- post-PEP survey wish disclose non-participation . A unique identification code generate officer , base day birth , first initial , first letter father 's last name mother 's last name . Written inform consent participate ESCUDO obtain pre- post-PEP survey , well separate consent follow-up . Only latter consent ask personal information permit study staff contact . The consent form follow-up also ask officer whether ever encounter syrinx duty last 6 month . Eligibility criteria Level 2 component study require officer consent complete pre- post-PEP survey report encounter syrinx within last 6 month comprise follow-up sampling frame . To achieve sufficient power study statistician applies algorithm randomly sample approximately 42 % eligible officer class 20-50 officer subsequently contact follow-up visit . A total 500 officer sub-cohort recruit . This sub-cohort undergo self-administered survey pre-PEP , immediately post-PEP 3 , 6- , 12 , 18- , 24-months post-PEP . While design standard feature step wedge design ( i.e. , staggered transition control intervention ) , evaluation differs . Unlike standard step wedge design every cluster assess step , one cluster evaluate per step secondary outcomes . This do would impractical follow 1200 officer 2 year , power sufficient sample size 500 outcome . Unlike traditional step wedge design evaluation stop last cluster transition control intervention , member sub-cohort follow 2 year . Follow-Up Survey : While 1200 police officer invite complete pre-PEP survey post-PEP survey immediately follow training informed consent , post-PEP follow-up interview occur 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month post-training conduct exclusively sub-cohort ( N=500 ) . The measure adapt focus appropriate recall period . Participants receive voucher movie ticket ( equivalent 20 USD ) follow-up interview . Follow-up : Follow-up interview conduct among sub-cohort ( N=500 ) , ask provide locator information baseline interview ( i.e. , home cell phone , pager , email , address ) , way prefer contact ( e.g. , SMS text ) . Statistical Analysis ( Aims 1-3 ) : The primary analysis consist examine outcome pre-PEP vs. post-PEP period utilize generalize linear mixed model ( GLMM ) apply repeated measure analysis cluster data . Mixed effect model allow u adjust within-subject within-cluster correlation ; one random effect capture within cluster correlation another capture nest subject-within-cluster correlation . Stepped wedge design reduce contamination bias , consider cluster ( , class ) act control hence provide data control intervention period ( Brown Lilford 2006 ) . Some degree contamination likely since PEP class occur 2 year social nature police . The investigator attempt measure ask officer sub-cohort whether officer discuss training topic prior receive PEP , whether discussed training topic officer post-PEP . These circumstance consider variable outcome analysis . Although investigator expect change occur linear manner ( e.g. , officer train few NSIs occur ) , intervention effect could curvilinear due diffusion information train untrained officer . As , investigator test linear non-linear effect time outcome . Level 3 : Although investigator aim shift police attitudinal norm PWID , sex worker HIV-positive person reduce adverse behavior theory-driven framework ( Aim 2 ) , unrealistic expect police admit misconduct ( e.g. , physical sexual abuse , solicit bribe ) interviewer . Fortunately , investigator unique position , Proyecto El Cuete , parallel cohort PWID Tijuana ( Robertson , Garfein et al . 2014 ) . Since 2010 , 866 PWIDs undergone semi-annual HIV test survey include question police encounter . This include negative experience syringe confiscation , arrest near SEPs drug treatment site , sexual physical abuse police , well positive experience , police referral SEPs OST . The availability data enable u externally assess impact PEP PWID risk behavior compare PWIDs ' policing experience vs. PEP . Since El Cuete fund 2020 , investigator data pre-PEP , 2 year PEP scale-up , 2 year post-PEP . The investigator hypothesize significant interaction PEP phase Time , sharp decline observe post-PEP phase . The investigator also create model interview time ( baseline , 6-months , 12-months , 72-months ) sole main fixed effect introduce quadratic term , investigator may observe curvilinear trend due PEP time . These finding result Proyecto ESCUDO use inform cost-effectiveness analysis , use measure collect police PWID sensitivity analysis .</detailed_description>
