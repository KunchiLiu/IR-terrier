	<brief_summary>The goal Phase 1 clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination Keytruda ( pembrolizumab , also call MK-3475 ) radiation therapy ( either conventional stereotactic body radiation therapy [ SBRT ] ) . The safety combination also study . The goal Phase 2 study learn combination therapy help control metastatic NSCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MK-3475 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 24 participant enrol Phase 1 study , 80 participant enrol Phase 2 . Phase 1 : If enrol Phase 1 , dose pembrolizumab receive depend join study . The first set participant receive low dose level pembrolizumab . Each new set receive high dose pembrolizumab set , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose pembrolizumab find . In addition pembrolizumab , receive either SBRT conventional radiation therapy , depend type radiation therapy doctor think well . Phase 2 : If enrol Phase 2 , receive pembrolizumab high dose tolerate Phase 1 . If doctor think SBRT would well , randomly assign ( flip coin ) either Group 1 Group 2 , describe . If doctor think conventional radiation therapy would better , randomly assign either Group 3 Group 4 . This do one know one study group well , , bad group . You equal chance either group . - If Group 1 , receive SBRT pembrolizumab . - If Group 2 , receive pembrolizumab alone . However , disease gotten bad 5 week possibly later , may able also start receive SBRT . If doctor think would safer , may cross Group 4 ( describe ) receive conventional radiation therapy instead SBRT . - If Group 3 , receive conventional radiation therapy pembrolizumab . - If Group 4 , receive pembrolizumab alone . However , disease gotten bad 5 week possibly later , may able continue receive pembrolizumab start receive conventional radiation therapy . Study Therapy Administration : You receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 3-week cycle . Radiation consist either 4 15 daily treatment last 30-45 minute day stay position . Depending group status disease , either start radiation day first pembrolizumab dose , disease gotten bad . The doctor discus radiation therapy schedule . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . One ( 1 ) day start Cycles 3 , 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 , CT , PET , MRI , x-ray , and/or ultrasound scan . Leftover tumor tissue earlier procedure use biomarker test . Biomarkers find blood tissue may relate reaction study treatment . Length Study : You may receive 16 cycle pembrolizumab . You receive 15 radiation treatment , depend group . You longer able take study drug intolerable side effect occur unable follow study direction . If disease gotten bad , may able continue study therapy , describe . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visits : About 30 day last dose pembrolizumab : - You physical exam . - Blood ( Â½ teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You CT , PET , MRI , x-ray , and/or ultrasound scan . - You may lung function test perform . About every 12 week 2 year finish last pembrolizumab cycle , follow test procedure may perform . Instead follow-up visit , possible study staff may call instead ask . - You may physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) may collect routine test . - You may CT , PET , MRI , x-ray and/or ultrasound scan . Starting 2 year finish last pembrolizumab cycle , physical exam and/or CT , PET , MRI , x-ray , and/or ultrasound scan every 12 week doctor think need . If procedure perform another hospital , information medical history , physical exam , lung function , scan sent MD Anderson review . This investigational study . Radiation therapy ( conventional SBRT ) FDA approve local control metastatic primary tumor . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma metastatic remove surgery . Its use patient metastatic NSCLC investigational . Up 104 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
