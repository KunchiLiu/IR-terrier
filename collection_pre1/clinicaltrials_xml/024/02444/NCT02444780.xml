	<brief_summary>Earlier study show low glutamine level acute admission ICU associate poor outcome [ 3,4 ] . Recently , find low plasma glutamine correlate severity illness presence infection non-elective ICU admission [ 5 , submit ] .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Plasma Glutamine Levels Before After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It know major surgery induces stress response characterise hormonal release inflammatory process [ 6,7 ] . This surgical stress response resemble catabolic stress find form critical illness . We measure plasma glutamine surgery unknown whether plasma glutamine level already low surgery patient lower plasma glutamine level consequence surgery . Most patient elective surgery group study underwent cardiac surgery use cardiopulmonary bypass ; know extracorporeal circulation induces inflammatory response clinical data effect plasma glutamine post-operative course relation plasma glutamine level [ 8,9 ] .</detailed_description>
