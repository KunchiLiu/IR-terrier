	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose wild-type reovirus ( viral therapy ) give sargramostim treat young patient high grade brain tumor come back responded standard therapy . A virus , call wild-type reovirus , change certain way , may able kill tumor cell without damage normal cell . Sargramostim may increase production blood cell may promote tumor cell kill effect wild-type reovirus . Giving wild-type reovirus together sargramostim may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wild-Type Reovirus Combination With Sargramostim Treating Younger Patients With High-Grade Relapsed Refractory Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) describe toxicity wild-type reovirus ( Reolysin ) give day three day follow two day treatment sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety , tolerability adverse event patient population . II . To assess median overall survival time patient population . III . To assess median progression free survival time patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether correlation antibody responsiveness virus positive tumor response Reolysin patient receive virus follow treatment GM-CSF . II . To determine whether correlation increase number circulate monocyte positive tumor response Reolysin patient receive virus follow treatment GM-CSF . III . To explore possible predictive value monocyte number response Reolysin + GM-CSF therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study wild-type reovirus . Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously ( SC ) daily day 1 2 wild-type reovirus intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 3-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
