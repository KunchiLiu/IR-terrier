	<brief_summary>Background : Heart failure ( HF ) many case final way coronary heart disease . In old 65 year important cause hospitalization . Many study analyze cause decompensation possible cause hospital re-admission evidence come hospital setting . Nevertheless , It know many patient usually attend primary care setting , treat General Practitioner refer hospital . The determinant condition whether stable HF patient hospitalize consequence decompensation remain still unclear . Objective : To develop validate predictive model base clinical variable easy measure primary care predict short-term hospitalization mortality cohort patient attend primary care set consequence HF decompensation . Methods : A cohort patient establish HF attend primary care set ( regular care hour ) consequence episode HF decompensation follow . To develop predictive model select variable previously find involve risk hospitalization mortality consequence HF well one could relevant study yet . Variables select easily determine primary care setting.. The predictive model obtain derivation cohort Spain validate external ( several European country ) validation cohort . Relevance : Our study help GP identify HF patient high risk hospitalization death manage accord accurate prognostic rule ( escala pronostica ) make primary care set . [ DISCUTIR ]</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DESIGN : Multicenter prospective cohort study patient diagnose Heart Failure suffer clinical decompensation follow 30 day order predict short-term hospitalització mortality . SETTING : 1 . Derivation cohort consist HF patient recruit 20 general practice settle city Barcelona . 2 . Internal validation cohort : population recruit come general practice derivation cohort . 3 . External Validation population come rest European country participant . Since health system could different participant country consider primary care consultation attend General Practitioners hospital setting ( include hour clinic manage GP ) . Previous version protocol present two European network : Euroohnet ( European research network hour ) EGPRN ( European General Practice Research Network ) . In order able generalize result European territory , European country would invite participate . Up data , Barcelona ( Spain ) , France , Slovenia , Ireland , Italia , Turkey Portugal accept participate . RECRUITMENT Participants consecutively recruit September 2014 September 2016 , amongst previously diagnose HF need attend primary care clinical decompensation Study protocol previously present potential GP participant hard copy distribute well informed consent sign patient accept include . In protocol instruction regard recruitment , inclusion criterion , measurement follow write . GP participant must agree study protocol , consent participate provide necessary data patient . Since observational study randomization need . Recruitment end sample size raise . STUDY POPULATION Heart Failure patient include study come primary care set . We consider primary care , health assistance provide outpatient General practitioner , hour care primary care set . Inclusion criterion : Patients age 45 previous diagnosis HF medical record decompensation HF treated/attended primary care setting moment inclusion . Decompensation define presence least one follow clinical condition ( 12 ) : - The worsen functional class accord criterion New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) . - A weight gain one kilogram period 24 hour great two kilogram maximum 72 hour . - Increased ankle edema ( self-reported patient , caregiver physician ) Exclusion criterion : - Patients severe psychiatric illness severe cognitive impairment , able complete study protocol . - Refusal participate study . - Patients directly attend hospital previous 30 day . Every patient follow 30 day decompensation episode . We intend consecutively include patient study period two year , December 2014 December 2016 . DATA COLLECTION : Procedures , measurement Instruments Sources information Variables obtain : - Interview patient - Clinical exploration - Primary medical record - Hospital discharge report . We create specifically design questionnaire study registry information personal medical history , clinical examination moment visit . These data supplement information primary care electronical medical record . Once patient sign informed consent proceed obtain variable measurement study . In final database identification number available patient . This ID easily associate data patient , GP . Identification patient allow rest researcher . Every GP participant list patient include study . The ID follow : Country : SP ( Spain ) , FR ( France ) , PO ( Portugal ) , TU ( Turkey ) …….. Surname GP responsible patient ( initial ) Date birth patient ( day/month/year ) ( -- / -- / -- -- ) ID number label main researcher country . The coordinator centre ( .Institut Català de la Salut . IDIAP-Jordi Gol , Spain ) design electronic on-line questionnaire ( http : //es.surveymonkey.com/ ) host website IDIAP-Jordi Gol : ( http : //www.idiapjgol.org/ ) e-mailed GP participant study . Potential predictive variable : - Age ( year ) - Gender - Personal medical history ( information obtain medical record interview ) dichotomous variable : Diabetes mellitus ( ICD 10 : E10 , E11 , E12 , E13 , E14 ) ( YES/NOT ) History cardiovascular disease ( CHD stroke ) ( ICD 10 : I20-125 ; I63-I66 ) ( YES/NOT ) Chronic Kidney disease ( ICD 10 N18 ) ( YES/NOT ) Current smoking ( ICD 10 : F17.1 ) ( YES/NOT ) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( ICD 10 : J43 , J44 ) ( YES/NOT ) Previous hospital admission consequence HF last year ( YES/NOT ) - Clinical exploration baseline visit ( decompensation episode ) NYHA ( III-IV v I-II ) ( YES/NOT ) Crackles ( YES/NOT ) Heart rate : beats/min Respiratory frequency Body Mass Index ( register weight height ) : km/m2 Temperature ( ºC ) Bilateral ankle edema fovea ( YES/NOT ) ECG : Normal , Atrial fibrillation , Branch block , Acute Ischemia , Other arrhythmias Systolic Blood pressure : mmHg Diastolic Blood pressure : mmHg Treated furosemide ( ) /torasemide ( b ) visit : mg/day Not 1-40 mg ( ) 5mg ( b ) 40-80mg ( ) 5-10mg ( b ) &gt; = 80 mg ( ) &gt; 10mg ( b ) Other possible cause decompensation : - Dietary sodium excess : supplementation salt aliment : ( YES/NOT ) - Compliance drug : ( YES/NOT ) - Excessive liquid intake : take &gt; 2 , 5 l/day - Suspected Respiratory infection : ( YES/NOT ) - Suspected infection ( YES/NOT ) - Known anemia ( YES/NOT ) Others ( By interview ) : - Time since first symptom : hour - Paroxistic dispnea : ( YES/NOT ) - Weight gain last week ( self perceive ) : ( YES/NOT ) 10 . Data diagnostic HF ( ICD 10 : I.50 ) medical record . 11 . Setting assistance : 1 . Regular care ( usual GP ) 2 . Out hour care 3 . At home</detailed_description>
