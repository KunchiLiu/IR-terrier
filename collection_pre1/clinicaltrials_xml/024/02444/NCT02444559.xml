	<brief_summary>The aim trial investigate clonidine prolongs duration adductor canal block . By use healthy volunteer investigator perform bilateral adductor canal block thereby control systemic effect clarify effect actually peripheral systemic . The investigator hypothesis clonidine/dexmedetomidine adjunct local anaesthetic prolongs duration peripheral nerve block peripheral mechanism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Perineural Clonidine Prolong Duration Nerve Block ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Efficient pain management promote mobilization convalescence essential ideal perioperative course . Regional nerve block central element postoperative regime many patient therefore important nerve block long last efficient . This trial investigate whether possible optimize postoperative pain management add clonidine local anaesthetic ropivacaine peripheral nerve block . The prolong effect use clonidine adjunct peripheral nerve block investigate several study . However , remain uncertain whether effect mediate systemic- , peripheral- combined systemic/peripheral mechanism . In trial adjuvating effect clonidine investigate use adductor canal block . This nerve block besides efficient pain treatment knee surgery , primarily sensory , therefore augments mobilization total knee arthroplasty . Method : On trial day volunteer receive bilateral adductor canal block . In one thigh receive local anaesthetic ropivacaine 20ml 5mg/ml placebo ( saline ) thigh ropivacaine 20ml 5mg/ml Clonidine 150Î¼g . The allocation blind volunteer investigator . The duration nerve block measure five different test : Temperature test , Pinprick , Pain tonic heat stimulation , Warmth detection threshold pain detection threshold . All test validate within pain research .</detailed_description>
