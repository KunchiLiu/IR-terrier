	<detailed_description>The cornea transparent , fixed focus lens front eye . The cornea 's curvature regular good vision . The common cause irregular cornea ( IC ) hospital contact lens practice Keratoconus ( KC ) relate cornea thin disorder . These condition cause mild marked impairment vision due High Order optical Aberrations ( HOA ) , degrade retinal image quality effectively correct spectacle soft contact lens . The gold standard management KC Corneal Rigid Gas Permeable contact lens ( corneal lens ) , correct approximately 90 % corneal irregularity . The corneal lens fit differently patient normal cornea compare KC bear cornea . This fitting characteristic vulnerability cornea KC implicate corneal scar disease progression well significantly reduce vision relate quality life ( QoL ) KC compare corneal lens wearer KC . In case corneal lenses well tolerate , cause corneal insult , reduce visual performance poor physical fitting characteristic , large diameter Scleral RGP contact lens ( scleral lens ) may use problem solver . Unlike small corneal lens bear cornea , scleral lens completely bridge cornea bear sclera . The aim research investigate performance scleral lenses participant habitually wear corneal lens . Methodology The propose quantitative experimental methodology randomise control trial ( RCT ) cross . The experimental intervention scleral RGP contact lens fitted fitting set manufacture exact specification optimise physical fitting characteristic optical performance . The control intervention conventional design Corneal Rigid Gas Permeable contact lens ( corneal lens ) . These lens consider gold standard management visual disability cause keratoconus IC disorder ( Robertson , Cavanagh 2011 ) . Main inclusion criterion ; patient age 18-69 irregular cornea disorder like keratoconus wear corneal lens . Exclusion criterion : Patients satisfy good vision comfort soft contact lenses spectacle . Procedure After consent procedure subject undergo National Eye Institute Visual Function Quality NEI-VFQ assessment baseline Best Corrected Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) Contrast Sensitivity Function ( CSF ) record . Detailed fitting alternative type corneal lenses scleral lens use state art design corneal scleral RGP lens design , widely use many clinic world-wide year . Appropriate clinical guideline best practice follow fitting use contact lens . The lead applicant contact lens specialist highly experienced fit corneal scleral RGP contact lens . Once fitting complete final lens check eye collection check three week post collection best fitting lens final result visual performance quality life 8-12 week daily lens wear . After check washout period least one month , participant wear original corneal lenses wear intervention start . The crossover lens implement washout period . During phase checkup perform identical manner first phase . Lens designs fit The participant initially fit corneal lens scleral lens achieve optimal fit . Horizontal vertical displacement well angular scleral lens rotation would measure establish best lens parameter . The corneal lenses Rose K™ design widely use world manufacture Menicon David Thomas contact lens laboratory . The scleral lens Zenlens™ , amenable wide variety customise adjustment fit optimisation , manufacture UCO Lavec BV laboratory Netherlands . Randomisation The research coordinator , colleague optometrist Anthony Stanton randomise register participant treatment control group . The participant chief investigator mask type lens supply . Outcome measure Visual quality Two key measure visual function , monocular best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) contrast sensitivity function ( CSF ) assess begin end lens wear period constitute outcome measure RCT . Both BCVA CSF test use commercially available instrument CSV 1000E , standardise test condition use several research study . Quality life The National Eye Institute-Visual Function Questionnaire ( NEI-VFQ ) ( Mangione 2000 ) vision-related quality life instrument design ass patient ' perception visual function quality life . This instrument , use researcher investigate keratoconus ( Kymes et al. , 2004 , 2008 ) , applied baseline begin study completion period use intervention . Statistical Data analysis A sample size calculation carry base , conservatively , parallel trial design use data previous research ( Marsack , Parker et al . 2007 , Nejabat , Khalili et al . 2012 , Davis , Schechtman et al . 2006 ) . The sample size calculation use ( Armitage Berry , 1987 ) formula give require sample size 15 participant group . The plan therefore continue study least 30 complete study , 15 start scleral lens 15 corneal lens . Preliminary check carry ensure carry-over effect first second treatment period , recommend literature ( Haynes et al. , 2006 ; Wellek &amp; Blettner , 2012 ) . We think unlikely cross-over effect washout period prevent . However , unlikely event significant washout effect large proportion participant drop second treatment period study treat non-crossover RCT data first period analyse usual way recommend Haynes et al . ( 2006 ) . Our conservative sample size calculation allow possibility . If satisfactory outcome preliminary check study analyse cross-over RCT ( Haynes et al. , 2006 ; Wellek &amp; Blettner , 2012 ) . Plan timescale The length participation study subject anticipate exceed 5-7months time likely required attend 4-6 occasion . Study total length anticipate early 2015 late 2016 . The RCT conduct Central Middlesex Hospital ( CMH ) Ophthalmology Department lead researcher senior contact lens specialist optometrist .</detailed_description>
