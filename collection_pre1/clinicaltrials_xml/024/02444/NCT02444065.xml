	<brief_summary>Treatments bulimia nervosa ( BN ) relatively high rate nonremission relapse , mean improve treatment high priority area . Rapid response treatment -cessation binge eat vomit symptom within first week treatment - robust predictor improve post-treatment outcome low relapse rate , study try facilitate rapid response mean improve treatment outcome . The present study respond gap literature test 4-session CBT-based individual intervention rapid response ( i.e. , `` CBT-RR '' ) , design augment standard day hospital ( DH ) treatment BN Purging Disorder ( PD ) focus strategy skill rapid symptom interruption . CBT-RR compare matched-intensity augmentative motivational interviewing ( MI ) intervention . Participants recruit hospital-based day program eating disorder , randomly assign one two condition addition DH usual . participant assess pre-intervention , post-intervention , week 4 DH , post-DH , 6 month follow-up . It hypothesize compare receive MI , patient receive CBT-RR likely exhibit rapid response day hospital treatment ( i.e. , &lt; /= 3 binge eat and/or vomit episode first 4 week ) . It hypothesize patient receive CBT-RR exhibit few binge eat and/or vomit episodes post-DH 6-month follow-up . Potential mediator moderator hypothesize treatment effect examine exploratory basis , include self-efficacy , motivation , hope ( potential mediator ) , emotion regulation , depression , cognitive psychopathology eat disorder , work alliance therapist ( potential moderator ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) empirically support treatment bulimia nervosa ( BN ) relate disorder , yet approximately 1/3 completers remit , substantial treatment attrition rate , 1/3 remit patient relapse within first 2 year . Improving CBT important research prerogative . Motivational interviewing ( MI ) augmentative intervention investigate improve CBT , review indicate efficacious eat disorder . The failure MI eating disorder lead consideration focus early behaviour change might productive therapeutic strategy . Rapid response treatment eat disorder reliably identify prognostic indicator eat disorder . For BN similar disorder , rapid response rapid reduction binge eating , vomit , dietary restriction first week treatment . Numerous study indicate patient rapidly respond treatment significantly likely remitted post treatment significantly less likely relapse , compare respond slowly . No preexist clinical , demographic , personality factor clearly emerge account effect . Given rapid response clear prognostic importance , give research fail identify mechanism drive finding , study seek determine whether rapid response facilitate clinically use target intervention design provide patient specific behavioural skill decrease bulimic symptom rapidly . Improving remission relapse rate high priority eat disorder research field . investigator already know cognitive behavioural strategy efficacy eat disorder , exist treatment need improvement . Rapid response area frequently describe clear prognostic importance clear mechanism accounting patient rapidly respond , suggest perhaps rapid response could facilitate patient provided skill , mindset , support . However , study date seek answer question determine whether rapid response facilitate order improve patient prognosis . Thus , study seek examine whether rapid response day hospital treatment facilitate clinically use augmentative CBT base intervention target early symptom change . The CBT intervention compare matched-intensity motivational interviewing ( MI ) intervention . The rationale use MI MI frequently use augment standard treatment , provide active treatment comparison , rationale present study emerge partly research aim understanding limitation MI treat eat disorder . Thus , MI provide theoretically-driven comparison group . It predict individual receive CBT ( versus MI ) likely classified rapid responder , few bulimic symptom post-day hospital 6-month follow-up . As well , hypothesize change self-efficacy , motivation , hopefulness may help account finding .</detailed_description>
