	<brief_title>PSG Versus Oxim-capnography Setup Home NIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With limited comparative data support different strategy , substantial variation across Europe United States method use clinician set home non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) patient chronic respiratory failure consequence sleep disorder breathing . Indeed data support practice , many centre employ full montage polysomnography , significant physical burden patient also financial burden healthcare provider term facility require , staff training equipment . The investigator propose undertake randomise control trial compare clinical effectiveness , term change daytime arterial partial pressure carbon dioxide ( PaCO2 ) 3 month , limited respiratory polygraphy full polysomnography set NIV patient COPD-OSA overlap . Secondary outcome measure 3 month include overnight control gas exchange , subjective sleep quality , health relate quality life ventilator adherence . COPD-OSA overlap patient group rise prevalence limited data currently available detail NIV set , wholly support rationale use increasingly important group target population trial .</detailed_description>
