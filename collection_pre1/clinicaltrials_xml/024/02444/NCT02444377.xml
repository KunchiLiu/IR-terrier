	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose study would evaluate effect interval train cardiovascular health , lipid profile body composition overweight obese men woman . A secondary purpose compare lab base measurement body composition [ 4-compartment model ( 4C ) ) portable equipment [ bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy ( BIS ) ultrasound ( US ) ] Participants : Seventy-six men woman ( age 18-55 yr ; BMI 25-45 kg/m2 ) randomly assign high-intensity short interval group ( SIT ) , high-intensity long interval group ( HIT ) control group ( CON ) . Procedures ( method ) : Participants assess peak oxygen utilization ( VO2peak ) , blood lipid , glucose insulin level . Body composition also measure use 4C model , measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) , air displacement plethysmography ( BodPod ) , BIS , comparison US value . Participants assign either train group undergo 3 week interval training , 3 day per week . SIT complete 10 bout series 1 min cycle 1 min rest period 90 % power output obtain VO2peak ; comparison HIT complete 5 bout protocol : 2 min bout 1 min recovery vary intensity VO2peak ( 80-100 % power output ) .</brief_summary>
