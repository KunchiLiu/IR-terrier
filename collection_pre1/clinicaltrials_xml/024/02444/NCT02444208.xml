	<brief_summary>Cocaine abuse unrelenting public-health concern . Behavioral therapy consider `` standard care '' reduce cocaine use prevent relapse . However , even intense behavioral intervention , rate relapse cocaine use discouragingly high ( i.e. , 60-95 % patient return drug use ) . Novel strategy urgently need improve treatment outcomes cocaine-use disorder . The overarch goal project assess feasibility , acceptability initial efficacy innovative cocaine-based inhibitory-control training procedure . This goal accomplish conduct Stage I pilot trial . Cocaine-dependent participant enrol randomized receive inhibitory-control training cocaine neutral image ( N=20/condition ) . This propose intervention , cocaine base inhibitory-control training , deliver use innovative computer program teach cocaine abuser inhibit pre-potent response cocaine neutral cue . The primary hypothesis propose procedure feasible acceptable participant . Feasibility assess determine time need enroll target sample ; adaptive randomization outcome ; participant attendance , completion adherence study procedure . Acceptability determine use Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire . The secondary hypothesis participant receive cocaine-based inhibitory-control training reduce drug use great extent counterpart neutral-image condition . Reduced cocaine use demonstrate few positive-urine sample use qualitative urinalysis reduction level benzoylecgonine determine quantitative urinalysis ( i.e. , ELISA ) . The third hypothesis participant receive cocaine-based inhibitory-control training show improved inhibitory control neurocognitive function relative counterpart neutral-image condition . Improved inhibitory control , impulsivity cognitive functioning demonstrate use battery clinical instrument laboratory task . The propose research highly innovative provide critical information regard feasibility , acceptability , initial efficacy cocaine-based inhibitory-control training reduce drug use improve inhibitory control neurocognitive function cocaine-dependent participant . Cocaine-based inhibitory control training also easy administer ( i.e. , 15 minute ) , inexpensive , need administer clinician , could easily incorporate current behavioral community-based treatment approach enhance sustain abstinence , thereby quickly impact clinical research practice .</brief_summary>
