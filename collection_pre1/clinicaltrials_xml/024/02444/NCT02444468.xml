	<brief_summary>This study investigate , randomize setting , use intermittent in-cast pneumatic foot-compression ( IPC ) preoperative treatment malleolar fracture . This investigate whether IPC effect prevent swell ankle , thereby prevent delay surgery due swell . The investigator include patient malleolar fracture require surgery two group , IPC bandage bandage , measure time diagnosis-to-surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malleolar fracture often complicate tissue swell due soft tissue injury , haemorrhage secondary inflammation . This lead severe oedema compromise ability perform surgery due blister formation inability close skin surgery . Studies show use intermittent pneumatic foot-compression ( IPC ) reduce wait time diagnosis surgery well reduce length hospital stay . Purpose study randomize study investigate whether patient require surgery malleolar fracture low diagnosis-to-surgery time use IPC patient use IPC . All patient age 18 admitted hospital malleolar fracture ( AO type 44-A , 44-B , 44-C ) require surgery , randomize either in-cast IPC cast-immobilization . Time diagnosis fracture ( time x-ray ) start surgery ( time incision ) primary outcome . Patients see postoperative ambulatory follow-up 14 day , 6 week , 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
