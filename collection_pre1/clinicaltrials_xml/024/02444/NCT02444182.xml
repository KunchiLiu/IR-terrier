	<detailed_description>The Food Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) United Nations World Health Organization ( WHO ) define probiotic `` live micro-organism , administer adequate amount , confer health benefit host '' ( WHO 2002 ) . They preferably human origin , able temporarily colonize gastrointestinal tract survive . They must also non-pathogenic non-toxic . Probiotics used prevention treatment infectious disease allergy ( Hatakka Saxelin , 2008 ; Salminen et al. , 2010 ) . In country probiotic recommend infant adults long-term enhancement immune response . Combinations probiotic , like Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 ( BB-12 ) Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) , appear effective respect ( Isolauri et al. , 2000 ; Rautava et al. , 2009 ; Smith et al. , 2012 ) . Probiotics mainly ingest orally , gastrointestinal tract thus primary target organ probiotic micro-organism . However , ingested form example tablet , chew gum , cheese milk , oral cavity expose probiotic . With world-wide increase use probiotic effect oral health become hot topic . Many type probiotic bacteria explore widely study specie belong genus Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium . Yogurt ferment milk product consider simple source probiotic administration human . The proven effect probiotic general health lead research oral health field include dental caries , periodontal disease halitosis . Some clinical study demonstrate decrease cariogenic mutans streptococci count dental plaque ( NÃ¤se et al . 2001 , Ahola et al . 2002 , Nikawa et al . 2004 , Caglar et al . 2007 , Twetman &amp; Keller 2012 ) . Probiotics also show improvement periodontal status patient periodontal disease ( Riccia et al . 2007 , Shimauchi et al . 2008 , Teughels et al . 2013 , Yanine et al . 2013 ) . Recently , Toiviainen et al . ( 2015 ) find combination Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) Bifidobacterium strain Bifidobacterium lactis ( BB-12 ) improve periodontal health healthy adult reduce plaque amount subsequently gingival inflammation without affect oral microbiota . More evidence necessary confirm efficacy combination LGG BB-12 oral health .</detailed_description>
