	<brief_summary>The administration intravenous fluid ubiquitous care critically ill . Commonly available isotonic crystalloid solution contain broad spectrum electrolyte composition include range chloride concentration . Recent study associate solution supraphysiologic chloride content hyperchloremia , metabolic acidosis renal vasoconstriction , acute kidney injury renal replacement therapy , increase mortality large , randomized-controlled trial conduct . SMART-MED large , cluster-randomized , multiple-crossover trial enrol critically ill patient Medical ICU Vanderbilt University June 2015 April 2017 . The primary endpoint incidence Major Adverse Kidney Events 30 day enrollment ( MAKE30 composite death , new renal replacement , persistent renal dysfunction discharge ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Isotonic Solutions Major Adverse Renal Events Trial Medical Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SMART-MED large , cluster-randomized , multiple-crossover trial 0.9 % saline versus physiologically-balanced isotonic crystalloids ( Lactated Ringers Plasma-LyteÂ© A ) regard incidence major adverse kidney event 30 day patient admit medical intensive care unit . Between June 2015 April 2017 , patient admit medical intensive care unit Vanderbilt University medical center 18 year old enrol . The study occur one-month block . The ICU randomize initial fluid group ( 0.9 % saline physiologically balanced crystalloids ) . The assigned fluid use exclusively patient receive isotonic crystalloid duration month-long block ( except presence pre-specified contraindication ) . The assigned study fluid switch end month-long block half month assign 0.9 % saline half month assign physiologically balance fluid . It anticipate around 5,300 patient enrol medical ICU study period . All aspect study design , intervention , data collection harmonize independent study address question non-medical intensive care unit Vanderbilt University similar study period ( SMART-SURG ) . A pre-specified data analysis plan dictate harmonize analysis SMART-MED SMART-SURG .</detailed_description>
