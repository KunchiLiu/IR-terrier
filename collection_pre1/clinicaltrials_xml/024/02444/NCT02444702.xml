	<brief_summary>The long term goal project dual fold . First , investigator wish derive , validate test impact clinical prediction rule determine patient suffer CLBP degenerative change lumbar spine refer pain legs likely require surgery successful outcomes long term . Second , investigator would like establish robust methodology statistical analysis guideline create clinical prediction rule physical therapy research . This observational cohort project first step towards goal . Here investigator specifically aim identify personal , behavioral , psychological , morphological , physical factor predict need surgery well level participation restriction patient suffer CLBP degenerative condition lumbar spine refer pain leg . The investigator also explore parameter predict success 1 month , 6 12 month patient underwent decompression/fusion surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical , Morphological Functional Success Predictors Following Lumbar Spinal Surgery Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain Degenerative Disorders .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A classification-based approach identify specific characteristic patient seriously suffer chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) refer pain leg likely respond certain intervention become research priority medical milieu general physical therapy particularly.While several classification develop predict success follow physical therapy intervention , methodological flaw clinical prediction rule create patient CLBP degenerative change lumbar spine refer pain legs likely require surgery successful outcome post-surgery . CLBP multifactorial morphological finding degenerative change lumbar spine may explain phenomenon full . The international classification functioning , disability health allow comprehensive description patient whole use classify patient accord anatomy , pathology , impairment capacity One-hundred fifty patient suffer CLBP degenerative condition lumbar spine refer pain legs candidate lumbar decompression/fusion surgery recruit physician office Meir medical center , department orthopaedic surgery , `` Kfar-Saba '' , Israel . The structure pathology lumbar spine analyze detail CT MRI imaging ( morphological measurement vertebra intervertebral disc ) . Another one-hundred fifty CT MRI image non symptomatic low back group take `` Meir medical center '' order characterize symptomatic group degenerative change .</detailed_description>
