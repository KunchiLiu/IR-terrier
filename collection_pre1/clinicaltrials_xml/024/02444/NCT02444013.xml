	<brief_title>Folic Acid Prevention Contrast Induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperhomocysteinemia consider independently associate great risk contrast induce nephropathy ( CIN ) previous study . However , relationship homocysteine-lowering therapy CIN remain uncertain . Folic acid consider common agent homocysteine-lowering therapy . Therefore , study aim determine whether periprocedural administration folic acid effective prevention CIN . 400 patient undergoing coronary CTA/angiography/angioplasty go initially enrol . Of patients,200 randomly assign receive standard dose folic acid ( 5mg tid , give least two day procedural continue two day ) , 200 receive placebo . Blood sample estimation serum creatinine collect 0 , 24 48h contrast agent administration . CIN define elevation creatinine ≥ 25 % ≥ 0.5 mg/dl baseline within 48h . The occurrence CIN major in-hospital clinical event record compare intervention control group .</detailed_description>
