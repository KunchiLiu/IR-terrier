	<brief_summary>Significant clinical improvement ME/CFS symptom observe two patient long-standing ME/CFS receive adjuvant chemotherapy include cyclophosphamide breast cancer , also one ME/CFS patient receive chemotherapy include iphosphamide Hodgkin lymphoma . Three pilot ME/CFS patient thereafter treat six intravenous infusion four week apart , two significant clinical response . The hypothesis subset ME/CFS patient activate immune system , ME/CFS symptom may alleviate treatment cyclophosphamide intravenous pulse infusion four week apart , six infusion total . The purpose present study treat ME/CFS patient cyclophosphamide intravenous pulse infusion four week apart , six infusion total . The effect ME/CFS symptom tolerability/side effect 12 month follow-up register , additional test perform objectively register change physical ability follow-up . Studies investigate possible large vessel endothelial dysfunction skin microvascular dysfunction perform start intervention follow-up .</brief_summary>
