	<brief_summary>To evaluate validate accuracy , precision trend ability blood pressure cardiac output measurement applanation tonometry cardiological patient : - atrial fibrillation - severe impaired leftventricular function - severe aortic valve stenosis - patient leave ventricular assist device Experimental measurement : continuous blood pressure measurement cardiac output measurement perform T-Line 200 pro device ( Tensys Medical Inc. , San Diego , USA ) Control measurement : gold-standard continuous blood pressure measurement perform invasive blood pressure measurement arterial cannulation cardiac output reference assess transcardiopulmonary thermodilution</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Blood Pressure Cardiac Output Measurement Using Applanation Tonometry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing complexity medical intervention critical care treatment elderly get population require precise accurate hemodynamic monitoring . ( 1 ) However , advance invasive hemodynamic monitoring often combined complication arterial central venous catheterization . Complications vessel harming , infection , cardiac arrhythmias nervous lesion likely occur . ( 2-4 ) Therefore , past various technique minimal- non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring device evaluate . ( 5 , 6 ) One promising technique continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitor applanation tonometry . Published data reveal efficacy technique . ( 7 ) However , ability technique remain unclear patient suffer cardiological pathology lead change stroke volume arterial fibrillation , highly reduces stroke volume severe impaired left-ventricular function severe aortic valve stenosis . Further , ability applanation tonometry patient without pulsatile blood flow patient left-ventricular assist device remain unclear . Therefore , validation technique perform present study . Further development applanation tonometry include pulse contour analysis enable assessment cardiac output . However , till limit data assess validation cardiac output measurement method . Cardiac output validation also perform planed clinical study .</detailed_description>
