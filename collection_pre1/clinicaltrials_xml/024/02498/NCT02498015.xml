	<brief_summary>A total 100 people chronic HCV recent injection drug use recipient opioid substitution therapy enrol 5 country 21 study site . Participants genotype 1a infection cirrhosis receive 12 week open-label paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir dasabuvir ( `` 3D '' ) , twice-daily ribavirin . Participants genotype 1b infection without cirrhosis receive 12 week open-label `` 3D '' . The study consist screen phase ( 6 week ) , treatment phase ( 12 week ) follow-up phase ( 96 week ) evaluate treatment response reinfection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 100 people recent injection drug use recipient opioid substitution therapy enrol drug alcohol clinic , tertiary liver infectious disease clinic community health centre across Canada , Europe , New Zealand , France , Australia . This include least 30 participant F3/F4 liver disease . Participants consider recent injection drug user use injection drug 6 month prior consent . Participants receive stable opioid substitution therapy ( stable dose &gt; 2 week ) also include . Patients frequent drug use judge treat physician compromise treatment safety exclude . The study drug consist two tablet co-formulated paritepravir/ritonavir/ombitasvir ( 75/50/12.5 mg ) daily , one dasabuvir tablet ( 250 mg ) twice daily , ribavirin ( 1000 mg ) daily two divided dos ( genotype 1a and/or cirrhosis ) . Electronic blister pack use improve monitor treatment adherence . This innovative strategy `` 3D '' interferon-free regimen could considerably enhance capacity scale-up HCV treatment among PWID , therefore evaluate phase IV study within well-defined PWID population .</detailed_description>
