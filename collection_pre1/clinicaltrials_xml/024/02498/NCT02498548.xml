	<brief_title>Training Eccentric Knee Function After SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower extremity eccentric motor control critically important locomotor function impair spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Even treadmill training , preliminary evidence indicate eccentric deficit persist among individual SCI . This proposal aim characterize eccentric motor control muscle knee locomotion evaluate efficacy downhill gait training moderate speed intervention improve eccentric function knee joint walking .</detailed_description>
