	<brief_title>Nivolumab With Without Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 patient persistent recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer , treat nivolumab combination nivolumab ipilimumab ass difference objective response rate ( ORR ) patient treat nivolumab versus treat combination nivolumab ipilimumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) hazard ratio patient treat nivolumab versus treat combination nivolumab ipilimumab . II . To estimate compare duration overall survival ( OS ) patient treat nivolumab combination nivolumab ipilimumab . III . To determine frequency severity adverse event associate treatment nivolumab combination nivolumab ipilimumab assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether cellular molecular laboratory parameter pre-treatment tissue peripheral blood specimen predict overall survival ( OS ) , tumor response modify RECIST 1.1 , progression-free survival ( PFS ) : II . Integrated Biomarker : Programmed cell death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression tumor cell tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TILs ) measure quantitative immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . III . Natural anti-tumor immunity tumor cell TILs measure use IHC T cell repertoire analysis . IV . Tumor `` immunogenicity '' determine neo-epitope landscape use next-generation whole exome sequencing ( NGS ) . V. Anti-tumor immune response peripheral blood , include serologic response analysis T cell receptor ( TCR ) repertoires deep sequencing . VI . Shift quantitative laboratory peripheral blood parameter first 6 12 week therapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment group . GROUP I : INDUCTION : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute every 2 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute every 2 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 21 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP II : INDUCTION : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute ipilimumab IV 90 minute . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute every 2 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 21 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 100 day , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
