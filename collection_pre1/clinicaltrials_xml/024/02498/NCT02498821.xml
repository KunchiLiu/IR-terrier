	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate difference time cost Sherlock 3CG® TCS Chest X-ray confirm location Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter ( PICC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Time Motion Related PICC Insertion Process Catheter Tip Confirmation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study cross-sectional , observational design , characterize time motion study . The study observe subject specific outcome time PICC insertion procedure begin subject cleared administration prescribe therapy . It compare two approach PICC line placement confirmation PICC tip placement . The two method place confirm PICC line examine study : 1 ) Standard Care , define PICC line placement Chest X-ray tip confirmation , 2 ) Sherlock 3CG® TCS magnetic track PICC placement ECG-based tip confirmation . These two approach currently use , investigational . The study evaluate time elapse begin PICC line placement procedure catheter tip confirmation ( subject release IV therapy ) . A researcher observe time catheter kit open catheter clear administration treatment . Limited subject follow-up include review subject medical record relate PICC line placement . Subjects follow point PICC line tip confirm subject release receive IV therapy . For subject , study data collect Day 1 . The study expect include 120 subject , 60 subject confirm PICC line placement use Chest X-ray , 60 confirm PICC line placement use Sherlock 3CG® TCS . Each group subject two clinical site use either tip confirmation method , total 4 study site .</detailed_description>
