	<brief_summary>The purpose phase I study test safety different dose level specially prepared cell collect call `` modify T cell '' . In screen part study tumor find protein call MUC16 . This protein present 70 % ovarian cancer . The investigator want find safe dose modify T cell patient type cancer progress standard chemotherapy . We also want find effect modify T cell patient cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Followed Intravenous Intraperitoneal Infusion Autologous T Cells Genetically Engineered Secrete IL-12 Target MUC16ecto Antigen Patients With Recurrent MUC16ecto+ Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 2 phase study : Screening Phase Intervention Phase . Only patient identify eligible Screening Phase may enroll Intervention Phase . Screening Phase : After sign Informed Consent 1 ( Screening Informed Consent ) , patient 's MUC16ecto tumor expression determine previously describe . In order eligible protocol , patient 's ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube carcinoma must express MUC16ecto protein detectable IHC analysis bank ( paraffin embed ) fresh biopsied tumor . After sign Informed Consent 1 , approximately 2 week elapse patient 's banked tumor test MUC16ecto expression . If patient 's tumor find express MUC16ecto , undergo leukapheresis collection peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , frozen future use . The leukapheresis product store end study case future research test relate study develop . Intervention Phase : Patients must sign Informed Consent 2 ( Intervention Informed Consent ) receive treatment study receive treatment study . Once patient eligible receive CAR+ T cell , frozen leukapheresis product thaw used generate 4H11-28z/fIL-12/EFGRt+ genetically-modified T cell . It expect take approximately 4-6 week prepare autologous CAR+ T cell . On day 1 patient cohorts II-V receive conditioning chemotherapy cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 2-4 day prior initial infusion autologous CAR+T cell . Patients receive autologous CAR+T cell 2 infusion , first IV second IP , comprise half total dose . The IV infusion give first . The patient closely monitor . One 3 day later clinically stable , patient receive remain dose CAR+T cell IP . Patients cohort I -I receive cyclophosphamide , receive T cell manner ( approximately half IV , follow close monitoring 1-3 day later , patient clinically stable , remain cell administer IP ) .</detailed_description>

No prior immunotherapy checkpoint blockade ( i.e . PD1 inhibitor , PDL1 inhibitor CTL4antagonist similar agent ) 6 month prior T cell infusion ( clinically significant related sideeffects relate must resolve ) . Known active hepatitis B infection , know history hepatitis C HIV infection Clinical radiographic evidence bowel obstruction , need parenteral hydration and/or nutrition Any condition/anomaly would interfere appropriate placement IP catheter study drug administration , include know suspected extensive abdominal adhesion . Any following cardiac condition : Clinically significant heart disease ( NYHA class III IV ) symptomatic congestive heart failure Myocardial infarction ≤6 month prior enrollment History clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia unexplained syncope , believe vasovagal nature due dehydration History severe nonischemic cardiomyopathy ejection fraction ≤20 % Active autoimmune disease ( exclude treat hypothyroidism ) . Such condition include limited systemic lupus erythematous , rheumatoid arthritis , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease temporal arteritis . Known suspected ovarian cancer metastasis central nervous system ( CNS ) prior history brain metastasis . Prior history seizure disorder Any concurrent active malignancy , define malignancy require therapy expectant observation , since adverse event result malignancy treatment may confound assessment safety adoptive T cell therapy ovarian cancer . Prior radiotherapy portion abdominal cavity pelvis Current pregnancy lactation Any follow within 28 day first date study treatment : Serious uncontrolled medical illness disorder opinion treat physician would make patient ineligible study Active uncontrolled infection ( exception uncomplicated urinary tract infection ) Abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation intraabdominal abscess Abdominal surgery ( reason IP port placement ) Any issue , opinion treat physician , would make patient ineligible study</criteria>
