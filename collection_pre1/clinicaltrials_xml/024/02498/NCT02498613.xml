	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study cediranib maleate combination olaparib treat patient solid tumor spread part body remove surgery , include breast cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , small cell lung cancer , pancreatic cancer . Cediranib maleate olaparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Cediranib maleate may also block flow oxygen tumor , may help make tumor sensitive olaparib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Cediranib Combination With Olaparib Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate ( ORR ) cediranib ( cediranib maleate ) plus olaparib combination patient advance metastatic solid tumor follow tumor type : non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , germline breast cancer , early onset 1/2 ( BRCA1/2 ) wild type ( wt ) , basaloid triple negative breast cancer ( b-TNBC ) , pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . The response assess Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability oral administration cediranib combination olaparib patient select advanced solid tumor . II . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) tumor cohort . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate prevalence mutation deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair gene tumor use BROCA panel correlate tumor regression mutation status . ( Integrated ) II . To evaluate change tumor hypoxia cediranib treatment compare baseline [ F-18 ] fluoromisonidazole ( FMISO ) positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) patient NSCLC . III . To evaluate BRCA1 expression patient NSCLC basaloid TNBC baseline change 4 day cediranib treatment NSCLC TNBC cohort . IV . To evaluate hypoxia marker baseline change treatment cediranib tumor tissue NSCLC TNBC cohort . V. To evaluate level angiogenesis/inflammatory marker include VEGF baseline treatment . VI . To evaluate level hypoxia-related microribonucleic acid ( miRNAs ) baseline treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 3-4 day undergo biopsy . After biopsy , patient continue receive cediranib maleate PO QD begin olaparib PO twice daily ( BID ) begin day post-dose biopsy ( day 4-7 ) day 8 course 1 ( biopsy cohorts-NSCLC TNBC ) day 4 course 1 ( non-biopsy cohorts-PDAC SCLC ) . Courses repeat every 28 day ( 35 day course 1 ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
