	<detailed_description>Physical exercise significant effect health promotion consequent reduction severity bipolar disorder ( BD ) . This review establish pattern response exercise potential impact pathophysiology BD ; , well , produce hypothesis acute chronic effect exercise may act differently ; provide future perspective focus exercise important innovative model treatment BD mental disorder . A critical evaluation literature undertaken include influence exercise health promotion patient mental disorder , neurochemical behavior exercise-induced , well reflective introduction news perspectives train control severe exercise domain . The exercise induce significant change monoaminergic , long-term training , work threshold exercise modulate positive effect mood . Fast adaptive effect high intensity interval training consider BD patient . However , must caution administration . We speculate exercise may way maintain euthymia case BD , make less vulnerable patient stay long time neutrality . Future research need adopt training strategy time efficient different area adequate population question .</detailed_description>
