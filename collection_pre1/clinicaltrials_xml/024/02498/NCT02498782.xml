	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Fexinidazole Dosing Regimens Treatment Adult Patients With Chagas Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chagas Disease ( CD ) rank among world 's neglected disease . In Latin America , 21 country endemic CD estimate 100 million people risk contract disease . Estimates 1980s indicate 16 million 18 million individual infect . In 1990s , series multinational control initiative , estimate number infect people revise 9.8 million 2001 . The estimate burden disease term disability-adjusted life year ( DALYs ) decline 2.7 million 1990 586,000 2001 . Recent estimate PAHO ( 2006 ) indicate 7.54 million infected people 55,185 new case per year . New safe effective treatment Chagas Disease urgently need . Current chemotherapy option CD significant limitation , include long treatment duration , safety tolerability concern . For many year , inhibitor sterol biosynthesis pathway , posaconazole ravuconazole , consider promise new drug candidate Chagas Disease . Following recent result CHAGAZASOL , investigator-initiated trial conduct Barcelona , high recrudescence rate observe posaconazole treatment arm ( 80-90 % , versus 5 % benznidazole arm ) , increase concern future class . Nitroimidazoles well-known class pharmacologically active compound , among several show good activity trypanosomes . While concern mutagenicity safety mitigate potential drug candidate , several member family widely use antibiotic , indicate possible select compound acceptable activity/toxicity profile class . Fexinidazole preclinical development broad-spectrum antiprotozoal drug Hoechst 1970s-1980s , clinical development pursue time . The molecule `` rediscover '' select development Drugs Neglected Diseases initiative ( DNDi ) new drug candidate sleep sickness , follow systematic review profile 700 nitroheterocyclic compound ( mostly nitroimidazoles ) diverse source , include assessment antiparasitic activity mutagenic potential . Fexinidazole underwent extensive regulatory toxicology study , include safety pharmacology ( respiratory , cardiovascular , general behaviour ) 4 week repeat dose toxicokinetics study rat dog . 90-day toxicology study perform Hoechst , allow validation 3 month dose rat dose 800 mg/kg/day dog 125 mg/kg/day . Overall , Fexinidazole find well tolerate , specific toxicity concern . During 2010-2011 , DNDi carry several Phase I clinical trial assess safety pharmacokinetics Fexinidazole human volunteer give single multiple dos . A pivotal phase II/III clinical safety efficacy study sleep sickness patient start 2012 to-date show encourage safety tolerability profile exposure patient . Fexinidazole previously describe effective superior benznidazole nifurtimox one acute murine infection model T. cruzi Brazil 32 strain , methodology use establish cure longer consider accurate . More recently , vitro study perform Institute Pasteur Korea ( IPK ) show Fexinidazole parent metabolite ( M1 M2 ) less equipotent versus T. cruzi vitro ( Tulahuen strain ) . Fexinidazole Sulfone ( M2 ) potent panel T. cruzi strain ( include Colombiana VL-10 ) albeit high concentration Benznidazole ( 2 4-fold ) . Fexinidazole Sulfone require 72 96 hr exposure concentration 100 mM ( 31 mg/ml ) Y strain ; Benznidazole exhibit kinetics require exposure low concentration 12.5 mM ( 3.3 mg/ml ) .</detailed_description>
