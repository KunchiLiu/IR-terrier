	<brief_title>Preliminary Review Cold Active Compression Therapy Traumatic Calcaneus Ankle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial research show cryocompression therapy apply post-operatively effective reduce recovery time improve health pain factor related patient recovery . However , limited research translate positive economic outcome hospital patient . In addition , reasonably hypothesize use cryocompression therapy system surgery lead increase rate reduction swell necessary allow proper operative procedure take place compare standard ice elevation ( RICE ) therapy technique cryocompression therapy apply post-operatively . This lead decrease hospital cost possible improved patient outcomes related recovery . Study Objectives This study examine initial efficacy cost-effectiveness use cryocompression therapy model pre-operatively post-operatively patient recently suffer traumatic calcaneus ankle fracture compare standard pre-operative RICE therapy procedure .</detailed_description>
