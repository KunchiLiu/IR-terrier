	<detailed_description>Study Procedures If participant take part study , ask : - Arrive Rehabilitation Robotics &amp; Prosthetics Testbed ( RRT ) building time agree participant , job coach key research personnel . - Use virtual reality system like large video game job coach . - Complete skill task virtual world video game : - Cleaning skill vacuum cleaning , mop litter collection . - Loading virtual box back virtual truck . - Fulfilling order delivery tangible box virtual warehouse . - Navigating different checkpoint outdoor virtual environment . - Money management skill recognize coin bill amount , count money give correct amount change virtual customer . - Communicating virtual character . - These task take place non-real virtual environment : warehouse , grocery , park lot , outside . - The job coach counselor participant would traditional job training . - The researcher ask participant question like disliked virtual reality system video game . These question ask directly via form . - There 15 minute break time every hour total time equal participant 's normal job coach interaction . - The participant ask participate 5 hour day , 15 day . Number training day decide participant , job coach , research staff . - Data related time performance start end task record background automatically . - Audio/visual and/or video documentation study may record . Video photographic recording use aid present study academic purpose . All information keep anonymous . - Subjects ' screening perform subject ' therapist beforehand , decide whether subject eligible study , base investigator ' inclusion/exclusion requirement . - Total Number Participants : Up 100 people ( Up 50 individual disabilities Up 50 healthy individual ) take part study .
