	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-centre , phase IV , biomarker-strategy design trial randomise control group adult liver transplant recipient undergo immunosuppression ( IS ) withdrawal . Immunosuppression drug ( IS ) : Tacrolimus , cyclosporine and/or mycophenolic acid , mycophenolate mofetil azathioprine . Enrolled participant randomise 1:1 either : 1 ) Non-Biomarker-based IS wean ( Weaning-All ; Arm A ) ; 2 ) Biomarker-based IS wean ( Arm B ) . In participant allocate Arm A IS withdrawn regardless result biomarker test . Among participant allocate Arm B , find biomarker-positive ( Arm B+ , i.e . potentially tolerant ) offer IS withdrawal , biomarker-negative participant ( Arm B- , i.e . potentially non-tolerant ) remain baseline maintenance IS . This allow u demonstrate biomarker useful test personalise IS offer drug withdrawal participant likely complete process successfully , avoid unnecessary rejection among developed tolerance . Comparing outcome IS withdrawal arm A B+ provide direct evidence clinical usefulness test function predictive accuracy . We establish biomarker drive safe IS withdrawal Positive Predictive Value less 0.80 , sensitivity least 070 . To account centre effect , use stratify randomization . Furthermore , avoid bias , participant undergoing drug withdrawal physician blind biomarker result . Participants randomized Arm B- know biomarker status , maintain study termination contribute secondary clinical outcome evaluation stability tolerance signature . Cost quality life ( HrQOL ) assessment conduct alongside trial estimate health-economic implication 2 different strategy . Furthermore , sequential biological specimen collect conduct ancillary mechanistic study . Recruitment take place 11 European liver transplant unit ( King 's College Hospital , Royal Free London , Newcastle , Birmingham , Leeds , Edinburgh , Cambridge , Leuven , Hannover , Berlin Barcelona ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . At time screening : 3 year posttransplant participant ≥50 year old , OR 6 year posttransplant participant age 1849 year old . 2 . Recipient either decease live donor liver transplant . 3 . Recipient single organ transplant 4 . Liver function test : direct bilirubin ≤17.1 umol/L Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤60 IU/L screen visit . 5 . On calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) base maintenance IS one follow : Low dose mycophenolic acid ( ≤ 1080 mg daily ) , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ≤ 1500 mg daily ) , azathioprine ( ≤ 150 mg daily ) ; mycophenolate/mycophenolic monotherapy ( effective contraception must use begin mycophenolate therapy , therapy , six week follow discontinuation therapy ) . 6 . Ability sign inform consent . 1 . Serum positivity Hepatitis C virus ( HCVRNA ) 2 . Serum positivity HIV1 infection , Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) surface antigen HBVDNA 3 . Immunemediated liver disease IS discontinuation inadvisable ( autoimmune hepatitis , primary sclerosing cholangitis , primary biliary cirrhosis ) . 4 . Acute chronic rejection within 52 week prior screen . 5 . Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 40 mL/min ( mitigate risk worsen renal failure rejection occur high level CNI require ) . 6 . The need chronic anticoagulation safely discontinue safely perform liver biopsy . 7 . Baseline ( screen ) liver biopsy show follow : ) acute rejection accord Banff criterion ; b ) early late chronic rejection accord Banff criterion ; c ) inflammatory activity and/or fibrosis excess permissive criterion ; f ) finding might make participation trial unsafe . Eligibility determine central pathologist . 8 . Patient age &lt; 18 year old time transplant . 9 . Pregnant female female childbearing age use effective contraception . 10 . Current illicit drug alcohol abuse . 11 . Inability participate frequent monitoring liver function ( every 3 week ) clinical visit IS withdrawal . 12 . Inability comply study direct treatment . 13 . Any medical condition opinion principal investigator would interfere safe completion trial . 14 . Participation another clinical trial month prior enrollment .</criteria>
