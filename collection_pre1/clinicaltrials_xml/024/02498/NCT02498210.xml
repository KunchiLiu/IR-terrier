	<detailed_description>IVM treatment patient low ovarian response . Does improve IVF outcome may cause activation ovarian follicle increase chance success follow IVF cycle ? Scientific background : Poor ovarian response ( POR ) one major therapeutic challenge vitro fertilization . The prevalence poor responder patient varies literature 9 24 % , however due increase childbearing age expect one main infertility cause . Failure respond adequately standard protocol recruit adequate follicle result decrease oocyte production , cycle cancellation , overall , associate significantly diminish probability pregnancy Several therapeutic approach POR explore ; yet , single effective strategy yet establish . Previously show mechanical manipulation ovarian cortex ovarian wedge resection ovarian `` drilling '' diathermy laser , induced follicle growth polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) patient . Recently , live birth report ovarian cortex fragmentation vitro disruption Hippo signal pathway activation Akt signaling . The treated ovarian fragment graft back patient follicle growth , retrieval mature egg , vitro fertilization embryo transfer ; healthy baby deliver . The Hippo signal pathway essential maintain optimal organ size conserve metazoan animal [ 6-8 ] . In study show ovarian fragmentation increase actin polymerization disrupt Hippo signal decrease phosphorylated Yes-associated protein ( pYAP ) level together increase nuclear localization YAP , lead increase expression CCN growth factor gene BIRC apoptosis inhibitor . Secreted CCN2 related factor promote follicle growth Genes involve ovarian fragmentation , Hippo signal , follicle growth important ovarian physiology pathophysiology . Ovarian fragmentation lead change intercellular tension facilitate conversion G-actin F-actin . Subsequent disruption Hippo signal decrease pYAP total YAP ratio , lead increase expression downstream CCN growth factor BIRC apoptosis inhibitor In vitro maturation ( IVM ) practice clinical setting decade . It suggest alternative conventional IVF minimizing risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) patient PCOS . Recently , IVM propose method patient undergoing anticancer treatment , particularly woman require rapid fertility preservation [ 9 ] face risk estrogen-sensitive cancer recurrence involve . Although IVM apply IVF poor responder equivocal result , several researcher show benefit IVM woman low ovarian response . For purpose IVM , oocytes retrieved ovarian follicle small 4-5mm diameter , ultrasound guidance single-lumen thinner aspiration needle . The aspiration pressure reduce compare regular IVF . Therefore , multiple needle puncture need low aspiration pressure use bloody aspirate may block thin needle lumen . Because immature oocyte enclose tightly pack cumulus cell , curettage follicle wall need dislodge cumulus oocyte complex . All lead fact IVM procedure increase mechanical stimulation ovarian cortex take place , consequent disruption Hippo signal pathway . Hypothesis aim Our aim investigate whether mechanical manipulation trigger ovarian cortex cause IVM cause ovarian follicular activation recruitment mechanism mention . Thus stimulation follow regular IVF cycle result improve ovarian response increase oocyte yield . Materials Methods Patients Prospective cohort study POR patient . Twenty five POR patient select base bologna criterion patient least one document POR cycle . IVM protocol POR patient treat IVM cycle accord IVF unit protocol , use FSH-priming . Briefly , baseline evaluation include hormonal profile ultrasound scan perform day 3 menstrual cycle . On day 3 , 150 IU/day recombinant FSH add 3 day . A second evaluation perform day 6 menstrual cycle . An injection 10,000 IU hCG ( Pregnyl ; Organon , Oss , Holland ) administer subcutaneously endometrial thickness â‰¥6 mm lead follicle least 12 mm . Oocyte retrieval perform ultrasound guidance 19G single-lumen aspiration needle ( Cook ; Queensland , Australia ) reduce aspiration pressure 7.5 kPa . The follicular fluid collect culture tube contain follicle flush buffer ( Cook ) 2 IU/ml heparin . Because difficulty identify compact oocyte complex , aspirate filter identify additional oocyte . In-Vitro Oocyte Maturation Germinal vesicle M1 oocytes culture IVM medium ( Sage ; CT , USA ) supplement 75 IU FSH 75IU luteinizing hormone ( LH ; Ferring , Keil , Germany ) check maturity 24-48 hour culture . Mature oocytes denude granulosa cell fertilize intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) . After ICSI , oocytes transfer IVF medium . Fertilization assess 18 hour ICSI examine oocyte appearance two distinct pronucleus ( 2PN ) extrusion two polar body . IVF protocol Following IVM treatment , patient fail conceive , offer conventional IVF treatment , use control ovarian hyperstimulation protocol , previous IVF treatment ( prior IVM cycle ) . Each patient serve control . Outcome measurements Outcome measurement include control ovarian hyperstimulation variable , number retrieve oocyte , mature oocyte day aspiration , fertilization rate , embryos quality number embryo transfer .</detailed_description>
