	<brief_summary>In competitive scenario , trainer coach seek improve performance athlete organize macrocycles ( year ) , mesocycles ( month ) , microcycles ( week ) training aim specific moment competition . The organization variable , mainly intensity exercise training routine stimulate important physiological pathway uphold superior gain VO2max , lead peak aerobic performance . However , due lack evidence , difficulty control large scale , effect intensity organization mesocycle periodization still poorly investigate .</brief_summary>
