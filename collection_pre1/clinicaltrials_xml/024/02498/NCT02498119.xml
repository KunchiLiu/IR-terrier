	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether increase lipid body leukocytes lead increase eicosanoid production . The 2nd purpose determine significant correlation lipid body formation enhance generation Lipoxygenase ( LO ) COX derive eicosanoids . The 3rd purpose , lipid body involve arachidonic acid ( AA ) metabolism , AA present lipid rich structure must release phospholipases free Arachidonic Acid ( AA ) must access eicosanoid form enzyme . The fourth objective determine compartmentalisation cPLA2 MAP kinases include ERK1 , ERK2 , p85 p38 involve AA liberation within lipid body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Arachidonic Acid Metabolites , From Patients With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome cluster biochemical physiological abnormality associate development cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes mellitus . The current study focus type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) . T2DM chronic disease people problem regulate blood sugar . This disorder consist array dysfunction characterize hyperglycemia result combination resistance insulin action , inadequate insulin secretion excessive inappropriate glucagon secretion . Insulin resistance result complex interplay nutrient overload , systemic fatty acid excess , inflammation adipose tissue , endoplasmic reticulum oxidative stress . At molecular lever , inflammatory cytokine , fatty acid derivative ceramides , diacylglycerols reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , activate several serine/threonine kinase , emerge important negative regulator insulin signal . Because ability directly oxidize DNA , protein lipid damage , ROS believe play key role metabolic syndrome possible development T2DM . It possible ROS oxidative stress , induced elevation glucose possibly free fatty acid level play key role cause insulin resistance , beta cell dysfunction ability activate stress sensitive signaling pathway . Lipids signal intermediate encompass vast range molecule distinct function . The characteristic include , lipid body ( LB ) sit production inflammatory mediator LB within inflammatory cell contain arachidonyl lipid serve precursor eicosanoids . In addition , formation LB within inflammatory macrophage positively correlate augmented increase prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) change . LB also could function drain compartment rapidly uptake re-acetylate free arachidonic acid potentially detrimental outcome host cell . Macrophage cell lipid body involve complex multi step mechanism depend different signal pathway regulate lipid influx , metabolism storage mobilization . In view clue investigator reason believe organic anion transporter might resident upon stimulation trans locate lipid body order export newly synthesize lipid mediator cytoplasmic space . Once outside lipid body eicosanoids exert intracrine function export plasma membrane resident transporter extracellular space . Free fatty acid adverse effect mitochondrial function include uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation generation ROS . Beta cell lipotoxicity amplify effect mediate concurrent hyperglycemia . The association obesity , fatty acid oxidative stress insulin action clearly merit attention particular focus molecular mechanism .</detailed_description>
