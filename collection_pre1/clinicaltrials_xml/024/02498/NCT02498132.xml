Moreover , BA evidence-base smoking cessation , mobile customization BA may also hold promise promote smoke cessation . With STTR fund NIMH , team currently complete development self-help BA mobile application name Moodivate referral PCPs patient elevate depressive symptom .

The purpose step examine Moodivate treatment feasibility , acceptability , adherence , change depressive symptom associate Moodivate compare MoodKit TAU . Considering BA also evidence base smoking cessation , within group 60 participant , plan recruit 10 participant current smoker receive Moodivate . Although small sample smoker receive BA mobile therapy , believe collect pilot data examine utilization Moodivate among group smoker provide valuable insight feasibility utilize BA mobile app promote smoke cessation .</detailed_description>
