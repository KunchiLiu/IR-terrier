	<brief_title>Obinutuzumab Treating Patients With Central Nervous System Lymphoma Who Have Achieved Complete Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect maintenance obinutuzumab duration complete response ( CR ) patient cluster differentiation ( CD ) 20+ B-cell primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) attain CR first-line treatment high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival CR ( overall survival [ OS ] -CR ) . II . To evaluate neurocognitive function , quality life , neuroimaging indicator neurotoxicity . III . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival calculate . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( MAINTENANCE THERAPY ) : Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 2 first course , day 1 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 60 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( OBSERVATION ) : Patients undergo observation total 3 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
