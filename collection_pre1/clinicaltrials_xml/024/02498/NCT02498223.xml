	<brief_summary>In order reduce physiological biomechanical load soldier expose , investigator want examine new approach distribute carry load accord measurement specific soldier ( body composition aerobic capacity ) . A functional index ( LCI=load carriage index ) provide commander tool well decision distribute total load among number soldier , accord soldier 's ability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjusting Load Carried Soldier According Body Composition Measurements Aerobic Capacity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>50 healthy , male female combat soldier recruit . Anthropometry maximal aerobic capacity measure participant : Physiological evaluation : participant perform physical stress treadmill change slope speed , carry 40 % body weight ( current instruction ) second time weight calculate examined body composition aerobic capacity base index ( LCI ) . The physiological response assess base heart rate , lactic acid blood oxygen consumption . Biomechanical evaluation : biomechanical response measure biomechanical lab : pressure shoulder waist load strap , walk analysis stress scatter foot . By experiment investigator want examine new index , LCI , physiologically biomechanically well current load distribution instruction .</detailed_description>
