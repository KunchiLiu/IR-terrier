	<detailed_description>This study single center , open-label baseline control imaging study design demonstrate safety , biodistribution dosimetry radiopharmaceutical Cu [ 64 ] -25 % CANF-Comb ( Cu = copper ; CANF = C-type Atrial Natriuretic Factor ) healthy , adult volunteer . By definition `` healthy '' volunteer individual , physical exam baseline electrocardiogram , evidence cardiovascular disease , history , care physician active medical condition . Each volunteer receive single intravenous bolus injection 4-8 mCi investigational radiotracer Cu [ 64 ] -25 % CANF-Comb follow whole body static PET-CT image 3 4 dedicate imaging time point , ( 1-4 hour , 5-10 hour , 22-26 hour 46-50 hour post injection ) . For safety assessment , physical examination perform baseline completion image assess interval change . An EKG vital sign obtain baseline , image time point ass interval change . Blood drawn baseline , image time point ass interval change serum chemistry complete blood count . Urine collect baseline imaging time point ass interval change urinalysis result . The amount radioactive tracer blood urine also assess 8 adult normal volunteer subject . One-mL blood sample obtain baseline , 1 , 2 , 4 , 24 hour post Cu [ 64 ] -25 % CANF-Comb injection prior discharge . Urine collect single accumulate collection 24 hour immediately follow injection Cu [ 64 ] -25 % CANF-Comb prior discharge . Tracer biodistribution evaluate measure tracer uptake various organ torso PET-CT scan . The organ use describe biodistribution radiopharmaceutical blood , liver , kidney , spleen , heart , bone , muscle organ show significant uptake . Only organs tissue contain visible accumulation activity select image quantification . Region Interests ( ROIs ) draw measure average activity concentration organ tissue . Values three-dimensional region interest ( 3D-ROI ) trace contour organ use . For large organ liver , large elliptical ROI encompass much organ possible used obtain average pixel value . To estimate bone activity , narrow , irregular ROIs drawn approximate visible cross section ilium large vertebra , average pixel value use . For blood activity , average pixel intensity large 3D-ROI drawn leave ventricle use , thereby avoid partial volume effect . Muscle activity take average value large elliptical ROI region buttock see MR image . Fat activity take average value large elliptical ROI region subcutaneous abdominal fat . All non-listed organ 's activity concentration measure similar fashion . Residence time calculate analytical integration fit time take account radioactive decay Cu [ 64 ] . Residence time express hour normalize one unit injected activity . Blood activity also assign heart , lungs bone marrow , organs activity measure directly ROI . The heart lung assign blood fraction base respective blood volume . Activity measure bone assign half cancellous bone half cortical bone . The percent inject dose value calculate extrapolate measure activity concentration organ whole organ use standard organ tissue volume . These standard volume normalized patient 's weight . Time activity curve construct value organ ROIs drawn include liver , spleen , kidney , bone , muscle blood pool remainder body combine data patient . The blood content organ include organ possible rather assign uniformly remainder body .</detailed_description>
