	<brief_summary>For investigator ' current experimental clinical trial , patient give 4 injection ipilimumab , give 3 week apart x 4 injection without cytokine-induced killer therapy . Investigators propose test dual therapy patient melanoma know stage I , metastatic melanoma . Investigators hypothesize form combinatorial immunotherapy result tumor stabilization shrinkage , significant prolongation progression-free , disease-free overall survival compare use ipilimumab alone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytokine-induced Killer Study Patients With Stage II Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>despite best clinical effort breakthrough biotechnology , patient diagnose advanced stage melanoma continue die disease . Reasons include : 1 ) patient often diagnosed time melanoma already spread site chest cavity , bone , liver , brain limiting option surgical excision 2 ) cancer cell resistant become resistant chemotherapy drug use treat patient . Resistance one type chemotherapy agent often rapidly lead resistance many chemotherapy drug . These reason major cause cancer progression usually discuss consider treatment option patient disease continue grow spread . However , another important part body consider -- immune system . Scientists clearly show melanoma cell produce number abnormal protein abnormal amount certain protein find normal melanoma cell . Normally one would expect patient develop immune response abnormal protein find cancer attack much way investigator would fight infection foreign bacteria virus . However , reason scientist fully understand , immune system fail respond adequately abnormal protein destroy melanoma cell . This human clinical trial propose new way make immune system recognize cancer cell encourage attack destroy . In project , investigator put mouse gene human melanoma cancer cell , cell produce abnormal sugar pattern stimulate immune system attack melanoma . This strategy work well kill human cancer cell laboratory , need tried melanoma patient see effective determine treatment cause side effect . Investigators propose test new treatment patient melanoma see stop , slow destroy tumor patient . Patients inject anti-tumor immunotherapy consist three type dead human melanoma cancer cell genetically alter express mouse gene responsible make abnormal sugar-protein cell . In Phase II Study , patient early stage melanoma undergo series intradermal injection cytokine-induced killer therapy . These cell line transduce recombinant . In addition cik therapy , patient also receive ipilimumab important component immunization strategy attempt enhance activate host immune system destroy grow tumor cell . Endpoints study include safety assessment , clinical , tumor immunological response .</detailed_description>
