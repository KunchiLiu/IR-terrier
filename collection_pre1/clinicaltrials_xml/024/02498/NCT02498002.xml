	<brief_summary>Obesity global concern link condition diabetes . Historically , condition manage reduce energy intake daily basis , often hamper low adherence rate compensatory reduction physical activity . Intermittent fasting ( IMF ) become popular alternative method weight loss , period normal eating punctuate day fast . However , despite popularity , IMF scarcely examine within literature . This study examine impact IMF energy balance associate health outcome relate condition diabetes . To achieve , 36 lean adult 36 overweight/obese adult recruit , exclude condition may adversely affected fasting . Once enrol , participant complete one month control phase , incorporate 12 day diet activity monitoring , ensure weight stable move intervention phase . The intervention phase begin lab protocol design examine body composition , rest metabolic rate metabolic response two successive meal . Once complete , participant randomise one three diet list . Comparing change see diet 1 2 provide first direct comparison IMF conventional strategy , diet 3 allow u ascertain role weight loss mediate effect IMF . 1 . Daily calorie restriction - Reduce energy intake 25 % daily basis 2 . IMF weight loss - Alternate 24 hour cycle fast feed 150 % normal intake feed 3 . IMF without weight loss - Alternate 24 hour cycle fast feed 200 % normal intake feed All three diet last 20 consecutive day , transition 24 hour diet cycle occur 15:00 day allow least one main meal per day . When fasting , participant permit water black tea/coffee eliminate energy intake . Once physical activity diet monitor 12 day intervention examine change energy expenditure ensure compliance . Having complete 20 diet cycle participant return laboratory repeat protocol describe earlier . Comparing result value see intervention allow effect IMF identify compare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment Local advertising form poster distribute throughout research institution , nearby organisation city Bath . The poster encourage interested person contact chief investigator receive information study involve . The research team look recruit 72 ( 36 lean , 36 overweight/obese ) individual satisfy entry criterion ( discuss later ) . Enrolment Potential volunteer use contact detail provide advertising material express interest research team provide copy participant information sheet read convenience . Those interested participate invited pre-enrolment consultation give opportunity ask question may study screened inclusion exclusion criterion . This involve measurement weight height , well completion entry criterion questionnaire , Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire . Providing satisfy relevant criterion talk study ask complete informed consent form . As part , procedure adipose tissue biopsy discuss participant ask decide whether would like include optional test . Baseline Lab Protocol ( LAB 1 ) Having formally enrol study , participant invite begin involvement study 60 minute visit University Bath follow 12 hour fast . During visit , researcher obtain urine sample check hydration level use Osmometer , take measurement height , weight waist circumference . A fasting blood sample also obtain use venepuncture measure rest level key hormone metabolite . To conclude visit participant ask perform submaximal exercise test calibrate 'Actiheart ' monitor use throughout study measure physical activity energy expenditure . For , participant ask remain treadmill intensity increase follow four stage : - Stage 1 - level walk 3.2 km/h - Stage 2 - brisk walk 5.2 km/h - Stage 3 - brisk walk 5.8 km/h steep gradient +10.2 % - Stage 4 - level run 12.5 km/h Stage 4 include formal exerciser , non-exercisers unlikely kind activity normal routine render calibration intensity unnecessary . Formal exerciser identify use entry criterion questionnaire . In addition , treadmill protocol stop earlier participant ask stop heart rate exceed 85 % age-predicted maximum . Monitoring Phase Before leave lab , participant provide Actiheart monitor , small device apply chest measure physical activity record heart rate movement every minute . They also provide set kitchen scale log book create weigh record food fluid intake set body weight scale track weight help keep stable . During four week monitoring phase , participant ask complete four 3-day monitoring period , comprise two weekday one weekend day whilst continue normal dietary exercise habit . The researcher arrange collection delivery monitoring equipment necessary . The purpose firstly ensure weight stability minimise confounding influence , secondly provide accurate baseline value key variable physical activity , finally ensure dietary record provide valid reflection habitual intake . Provided data obtain control phase satisfies relevant reliability criterion , participant invite return physiology lab least four week first visit . In preparation , participant ask avoid strenuous exercise , alcohol caffeine , fast overnight arrive lab follow morning . Pre-Intervention Lab Protocol ( LAB 2 ) Before begin intervention participant ask attend pre-intervention lab protocol , outline . Female participant ask schedule coincides follicular phase menstrual cycle ( 3-10 day onset menses ) hormone profile stable . On day visit participant ask consume one pint water 06:30 prepare arrive lab 07:30 , wear light clothes ( i.e . short , t-shirt ) metal component jewellery . They need provide small urine sample check hydration level measurement height , weight waist circumference take ( NOTE : If weight varies 1.0 kilogram compare baseline measurement may ask repeat monitor phase ) . At 07:45 participant ask lie semi-recumbent position rest 30 minute . This preparation measurement rest metabolic rate substrate oxidation complete 08:15 three 5-minute period use indirect calorimetry participant remain rest . Following intravenous cannula fit antecubital vein elbow blood sample throughout visit . At point 12 ml fast blood sample also draw measure rest level key metabolite ( e.g . glucose , insulin , cholesterol , leptin , ghrelin , etc. ) . At 08:45 , participant elect include adipose tissue biopsy undergo procedure . If include , area side abdomen waistband sterilise injected anaesthetic ( Lidocaine Hydrochloride ) numb area . Using large needle 0.5 gram sample adipose tissue take skin . There bruise , leave heal scarring . Those choose include biopsy simply continue rest . At 09:00 participant ask complete visual analogue scale ( VAS ) provide subjective measure appetite , fullness desire eat . Immediately , participant provide test breakfast instant porridge make whole milk sugar need consume within 10 minute . Key measure take follow interval : - 12 ml blood sample - 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 - Visual analogue scale - 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 - Metabolic rate ( indirect calorimetry ) - 60 . 120 , 180 ( Note : total urine output also quantify throughout postprandial period adjust substrate oxidation value protein oxidation ) At 12:05 participant ask place hand cannulate arm pad Perspex box heat 55 degree . This allow venous blood arterialise provide good indication whole body glucose metabolism test follow . At 12:15 7 ml blood sample drawn participant ask consume milkshake provide 33 % energy requirement . Blood sample ( 7 ml ) drawn every 15 minute ensue two hour test presence second meal effect . At 14:15 final blood sample visit drawn cannula remove . To conclude pre-intervention protocol participant take separate lab dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan . This specialized form whole-body scan measure person 's weight distribute fat muscle tissue . It take approximately eight minute require participant lie still throughout . It administer small dose ionize radiation , equivalent 7 microSieverts accompany risk detrimental radiation effect region 1 10 million . The application method approve study independent medical physic expert clinical radiation expert . Intervention Phase Before exit lab participant randomise one three treatment condition outline . All three diet group last 20 day total , transition 24 hour cycle occur 15:00 day , idea allow consume least one main meal per day case . For intermittent fast group ( IMF ) , please note fast cycle participant ask consume water black tea/coffee milk sugar . During feed cycle , throughout daily calorie restriction diet , participant ask recreate control phase diet record appropriately modify quantity give 75 % , 150 % 200 % normal calorie intake accordance group assign . Where recreation possible , participant ask note item remove and/or item add new diet record provide leave lab . Physical activity also monitor first last week intervention use Actiheart monitor examine behavioural adaptation diet . 1 . Daily calorie restriction - Reduce energy intake 25 % daily basis 2 . IMF weight loss - Alternate 24 hour cycle fast feed 150 % normal intake feed 3 . IMF without weight loss - Alternate 24 hour cycle fast feed 200 % normal intake feeding At 15:00 day initial lab visit , male participant begin assign diet , although postpone one week necessary . Female participant ask delay six day case order ensure post-intervention lab visit fall within phase menstrual cycle minimise impact monthly hormonal fluctuation . Post-Intervention Lab Protocol ( LAB 3 ) Following completion 20 consecutive 24 hour dietary cycle , participant return normal diet one day ( prescribe ) whilst avoid strenuous exercise , smoking , alcohol caffeine , fast arrive lab follow morning post-intervention lab visit . Having consume pint water 06:30 arrive 07:30 light clothing , participant undergo lab protocol describe earlier pre-intervention visit . However , instead randomise diet group ask complete feedback questionnaire experience study . Follow-up Four week post-intervention lab visit participant invite feedback session discus available result . The result meal test study whole follow later date due logistics cost-effectiveness . Where convenient participant also ask include weight measurement provide indication weight loss sustainability . Aim Once datasets obtain 72 participant , daily calorie restriction group compare IMF weight loss group . This permit comparison effect IMF diet effect conventional approach match energy deficit . The final group , IMF without weight loss , highlight relative contribution weight loss fasting-dependent mechanism produce observed effect .</detailed_description>
