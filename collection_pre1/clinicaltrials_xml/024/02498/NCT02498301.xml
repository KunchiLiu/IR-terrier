	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop evidence relative efficacy 2 rifaximin chemoprophylaxis regimens prevention Travelers ' Diarrhea ( TD ) deploy set . An additional purpose explore effect chemoprophylaxis microbial flora antimicrobial resistance , obtain parameter estimate inform cost-effectiveness model chemoprophylaxis prevention TD . Information study use develop management guideline prevention TD among deployed ( United States ( US ) United Kingdom ( UK ) military personnel . The study multi-site , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , clinical trial among deployed military personnel . The study test 2 TD chemoprophylaxis regimen ( daily versus twice daily ) antibiotic , rifaximin , compare placebo . For propose chemoprophylaxis study describe herein , cohort military personnel ( US UK ) deploying/traveling overseas recruit prior travel participate undergo enrollment procedure outline study appendix . Subjects eligible agree participate randomize receive one 3 regimen : ( 1 ) rifaximin 550 mg daily ; ( 2 ) rifaximin 550 mg twice day ; ( 3 ) placebo , take deployed . Chemoprophylaxis maintain duration travel predetermine period 6 week least 2 week , may include period 5 day use return COO deployment less 6 week duration . Clinical laboratory data obtain , available deployment/chemoprophylaxis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary efficacy outcome assess review symptom memory aid ( TravMil diary ) . Subjects follow symptom memory aid onset disease episode record relevant symptomatology ( date/time number diarrheal episode , associate symptom fever , vomit , nausea , bloody stool cramp , severity symptom , functional activity ) . Use antibiotic and/or Imodium ( loperamide ) episode also record ) . An additional memory aid capture occurrence solicit adverse event , use new prescription medication , well adherence study medication regimen utilized subject deployment return ( re-created study personnel lose incomplete ) follow-up Memory aid data actively sought subject via require in-person follow-up . Secondary efficacy outcome also largely derive self-report subject via use memory aid data . Secondary safety evaluation perform end study visit base history obtain subject regard medical treatment require event deploy . Individuals enrol prior travel/deployment . At time enrollment undergo eligibility criterion review , informed consent process , baseline assessment ( demographic , medical history , others ) , sample collection ( blood stool ) , blind randomization study arm . Episodes diarrhea expect occur study drug . Subjects instruct expect seek care episodes medical asset available COD . Subjects instruct discontinue study drug develop diarrhea give antibiotic therapy . It expect study drug impact choice effectiveness antibiotic use treat traveler ' diarrhea . Some subject eligible restart ( restart ) study drug cure traveler ' diarrhea episode . See US UK addendum detail . The end prophylaxis define +/- 96hr period cessation prophylaxis due ( A ) subject complete maximal period prophylaxis remain deploy , ( B ) re-deployed return mainland/COO . During end prophylaxis period , subject may see study personnel perform end prophylaxis visit . The post-deployment period define return COO 8 week return . A post-deployment visit , COO plan subject enrol study occur soon schedule . All subject ask complete baseline questionnaire day enrollment complete web-based survey follow-up period . Subjects email survey link 3 6 month post-return COO . The survey assess several type functional bowel disorder symptoms ReA use standardized question definition question use disease activity scale assess impact daily life . A sample blood collect 2 time part participation study . The sample collect , process store transport later date central lab test acute convalescent titer direct bacterial viral enteropathogens . Samples also use biomarker evaluation support exploratory objective . Stool sample use exploratory microbiological analysis assess etiology diarrhea pathogen , antibiotic susceptibility enteropathogens , evaluation impact rifaximin microbiome . Serum utilized attempt determine seroconversion status pathogen identify stool analysis .</detailed_description>
