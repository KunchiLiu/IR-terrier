	<brief_summary>The purpose double-blinded , randomize control trial ( 1 ) determine addition trigger point dry needling ( TDN ) standard stretch program result great improvement hamstring flexibility versus stretch alone population atraumatic knee pain ; ( 2 ) measure length time flexibility gain maintain , ( 3 ) ass result movement mechanic ( 4 ) ass patient report change pain . Findings potentially lead insight benefit apply intervention additional body region .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dry Needling Stretching vs. Stretching Alone Hamstring Flexibility Patients With Knee Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , 40 subject history atraumatic knee pain randomize 2 group 20 subject per group ( 1 experimental group 1 control group ) . Subjects experimental group receive TDN intervention hamstring stretch subject control group receive alternative needling intervention hamstring stretch . After meet inclusion criterion , subject undergo follow test : supine active knee extension , active straight leg raise test , deep squat , single leg step 6 inch step . Subjects measure le 20° full extension active knee extension test exclude . Hamstring tightness operationally define great 20° loss knee extension measure femur hold 90° hip flexion . [ 1 ] Manual palpation bilateral biceps femoris , semitendinosus , semimembranosus perform detect presence myofascial trigger point ( TPs ) group 1 2 . Dry needle perform detected TPs provider train experienced TDN . Post TDN , test immediately repeat follow subject complete Global Rating Change survey ( GROC ) Lower Extremity Functional Scale ( LEFS ) . Post intervention , subject experimental group 1 give stand hamstring stretch perform 1 repetition hold 30 second , repeat 3 time daily . These parameter show effective improve flexibility . [ 2 ] Subjects instruct demonstration provide handout stretch instruction . Subjects give exercise log record home exercise compliance . Subjects group 2 give alternative needle intervention follow stand hamstring stretch perform 3 time per day , 1 repetition hold 30 second . Alternative needle intervention perform give appearance regular TDN intervention ; however , needle penetration perform . Following alternative needling intervention , subject instruct demonstration provide handout hamstring stretch instruction . Home exercise compliance record follow . Follow measurement record 1-2 day , 3-4 day , 7-8 day post intervention . All test repeat . One additional session TDN alternative needling intervention perform day 3-4 .</detailed_description>
