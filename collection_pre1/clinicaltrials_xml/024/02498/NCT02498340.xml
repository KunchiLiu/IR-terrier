	<brief_title>Diet Challenge G6PD Deficient Egyptian Children : A One- Year Prospective Single Center Study With Genotype - Phenotype Correlation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigate effect challenge non-fava bean diet occurrence hemolysis common rare mutation cause G6PD deficiency Egyptian child well make genotype-phenotype correlation . Patients Methods : The study include G6PD deficient child regularly follow Pediatric Hematology Center , Ain Shams University last decade 2004-2014 stop eat non fava-bean diet since diagnosis G6PD deficient willing participate diet challenge . They enrol one year prospective study involve quantitative analysis enzymatic activity , molecular type G6PD enzyme use polymerase chain reaction-amplification refractory mutation system ( PCR-ARMS ) technique . Patient 's medical record review history blood transfusion G6PD level diagnosis . Initial phase dietetic challenge ingestion non-fava bean take small amount ( 10-20 gm/day 3 successive day ) child haemoglobin level ≥ 11 gm/dl daily clinical laboratory monitor complete blood count , marker hemolysis well measurement malondialdehyde ( MDA ) level basal study end . A drop Hb ≥0.5 gm/dl / appearance hemoglobinuria consider significant hemolysis . Patients meet definition significant hemolysis prospectively follow one year follow chronic exposure complete blood count hemolysis markers/ 3 month .</detailed_description>
