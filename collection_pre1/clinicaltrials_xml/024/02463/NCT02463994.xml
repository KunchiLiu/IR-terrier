	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether brief course radiation therapy give one area affect cancer improve chance respond immuno-therapy form medicine call MPDL3280A , antibody PD-L1 . PD-L1 express lung cancer know block effect body 's immune system attack cancer . Blocking PD-L1 show improve body 's immune cell attack kill cancer cell non-small cell lung cancer . The goal study see prior treatment radiation allow improved recognition cancer body 's immune cell presence MPDL3280A .</brief_summary>
