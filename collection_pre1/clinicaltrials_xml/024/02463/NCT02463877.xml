	<brief_title>A Minimally-invasive Approach Cytoreduction HIPEC Peritoneal Surface Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential patient prospectively identify prior time operation base inclusion/exclusion criterion . Those meet eligibility criterion sign consent undergo laparoscopy . During laparoscopy , peritoneal cancer index ( PCI ) determine patient . The PCI scoring system develop standardize assessment disease burden . PCI determine assign Lesion size score ( LSS ) 13 peritoneal region sum score ( define ) . Those PCI ≤10 continue laparoscopic cytoreduction HIPEC . Patients PCI &gt; 10 open cytoreduction HIPEC . The Investigators plan enroll 30 patient , though investigator estimate 18 ultimately undergo laparoscopic cytoreduction HIPEC . Trial Design : - Stage 1 enroll 9 patient , 2 less patient experience postoperative complication within 30 day HIPEC investigator proceed stage 2 . If 3 patient experience postoperative complication investigator terminate trial early secondary futility . - Stage 2 enroll 9 additional patient , investigator 4 less patient postoperative complication total 18 patient investigator reject null hypothesis . Visit 1- screen - History physical examination - Routine blood test standard monitor patient 's disease include complete blood count , kidney liver chemistry , tumor marker ( CEA carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ( CA19-9 ) ) already perform ; - Imaging test per standard care ( chest x-ray , CT scan ; PET Scan ) ; possibly laparoscopy colonoscopy ( scan patient abdomen area ) ; perform prior consultation University California , San Diego ( UCSD ) - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ; thallium heart scan echocardiogram history cardiac disease ( prior Myocardial Infarction , Congestive Heart Failure , angina , cardiomyopathy , vascular dysfunction arrhythmia ) Visit 2 - operation/ surgery - Physical exam update medical history - Routine blood test - Laparoscopic exploration prior cytoreduction , perform , per local standard care assessment PCI . - HIPEC administer per local standard care.. - A great omentectomy perform routinely case do open cytoreduction . Greater less omentectomy , omental bursectomy , splenectomy , leave right upper quadrant pelvic peritonectomy , cholecystectomy , total abdominal hysterectomy , low anterior resection and/or gastrectomy perform surgeon 's discretion base volume distribution peritoneal surface malignancy aim achieve complete resection grossly apparent disease . - Peritonectomy organ resection perform achieve optimal cytoreduction ( defined removal gross disease cytoreduction gross deposit le 2.5 mm thickness ) . - If determine optimal cytoreduction achieve minimally-invasive technique , procedure convert open operation . - Laparotomy -In case minimally-invasive optimal cytoreduction achieve , small ( 4 6 cm ) laparotomy incision make necessary organ extraction wound protector use . The mini-laparotomy incision utilized insertion HIPEC catheter . - Temporary skin closure perform port site incision closed-HIPEC . Bowel anastomose fascial closure port sit ≥ 1 cm mini-laparotomy incision perform completion HIPEC . - Completeness cytoreduction estimate record use system show . Intra-peritoneal tubes drain place surgeon 's discretion incision close usual fashion . - After procedure , patient stay intensive care unit ( ICU ) 24-48 hour . For least 4 hour procedure patient ask stay bed . The patient stay hospital approximately 3-5 day procedure . This part standard care . Surgery must start within 8 week time screen . Surgery must perform surgeon experienced cytoreductive HIPEC surgery meet credentialing requirement study . Pre-perfusion protocol perfusion circuit set-up priming : At conclusion cytoreductive surgery , hemodynamic stability patient assure bleed point control per standard practice . Systemic body temperature monitor . The perfusion system assemble per operator 's manual utilizing sterile technique . The perfusion circuit prim balance electrolyte solution ; 1.5 % Delflex Peritoneal Dialysis ( DPD ) solution prefer . In absence ascites , approximately 3-4 Liters perfusate require circuit prim average 70-kg adult . A general guideline 1.5-2.0 L/m2 perfusate . The perfusate prim , heat target temperature discretion operate surgeon re-circulated . After patient receives cytoreductive surgery HIPEC whether minimal invasive open approach , biohazardous fluid collect chemotherapy waste container disposal . Placement inflow outflow catheter temperature probes Peritoneal perfusion catheter temperature probe place operate surgeon accordance standard practice . Inflow catheter position sub-diaphragmatic region peritoneal cavity prefer . Outflow catheter position pelvis prefer . This protocol allow open delivery heat chemotherapy surgeon discretion . Timing intestinal reconstruction formation stoma surgeon discretion . Sterile pump line perfusion system deliver sterile field line fill perfusate prevent airlock . The inflow outflow tube connect pre-heated perfusate allow fill peritoneal cavity . Usually ~3 liter solution require distend cavity achieve desire flow rate . Recommended anesthetic management intra-operative physiological monitoring HIPEC An epidural catheter may place discretion operate team ( anesthesiologist surgeon ) . Broad-spectrum antimicrobial prophylaxis recommend prior surgical incision ( specific antibiotic discretion operate surgeon ) . Radial arterial cannulation may establish arterial-line blood pressure monitoring . A triple lumen central venous catheter may place anesthesiologist 's discretion . A nasogastric tude typically place decompress stomach . A transurethral catheter place bladder . During cytoreductive surgery , careful attention end tidal carbon dioxide , oxygen saturation peak airway pressure make diaphragmatic strip assess sign pneumothorax . The patient 's core body temperature may reduce 35 degree Celsius ( 95 °F ) prior commence hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy . At start hyperthermic chemotherapeutic infusion , Bair Hugger may set blow ambient air flow patient . Adequate intravenous fluid hydration crystalloid and/or colloid prior initiation hyperthermic chemotherapeutic perfusion important , systemic vasodilatation occur perfusion . Urinary output HIPEC maintain 0.5-1.0 ml/kg/hr . Clotting time INR , serum electrolyte , blood gas , vital sign monitor throughout procedure . Standards anesthetic practice intervention occur clinically appropriate . Fresh frozen plasma utilized maintain INR ≤ 1.5 appropriate - Heated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy deliver . At completion perfusion , abdomen re-explored , residual fluid aspirate , bleed point control reconstructive operation complete already do prior HIPEC ( anastomosis without divert stoma ) . - Mitomycin C agent administer patient primary appendiceal colorectal cancer dose 30 mg/kg . For rare case primary peritoneal mesothelioma ovarian primary tumor , Cisplatin ( 50 mg/m2 ) Doxorubicin ( 15 mg/m2 ) may use . This current standard care specific trial protocol . Follow visits- A follow visit 2 week 6 week surgery physical exam update medical history . Then every 3 month ( +/- 2 week ) first three year , every 6 month next 2 year , yearly thereafter evidence recurrence . The patient need follow test procedure routine follow-up visit . These part regular cancer surveillance care specific study . Physical exam update medical history ; Pain assessment ; Routine blood test study blood test ; Cross-sectional imaging CT scan MRI per standard care If patient develop symptom exam finding warrant cross-sectional image different time point , image perform need . Data collect include demographic ( age , gender ) , past medical history , past surgical history , weight , body mass index , body surface area , ICU length stay , hospital length stay , IV narcotic requirement , time return bowel function , need duration Nasogastric tube ( NGT ) decompression , diagnosis , surgical procedure perform , HIPEC agent administer , operative time , estimate blood loss , postoperative complication record . Postoperative complication define accord validate classification system propose Clavien colleagues.8 Briefly , complication define deviation normal postoperative course . Complications classify accord involve organ system grade accord therapy require treat complication . Grade I complication deviation expect / normal course , require pharmacologic , surgical , endoscopic , radiological intervention treatment . Grade II complication require pharmacologic intervention , include blood transfusion total parenteral nutrition . Grade III complication require surgical , endoscopic , radiological intervention . Grade IV complication define life-threatening event require intensive care management . Grade V complication define death . For assessment oncologic outcome , patient follow clinic visit every 3 month first year , every 6 month next 2 year , yearly thereafter evidence recurrence . For patient recurrent disease , data collect : site recurrence , date recurrence , disease status ( evidence disease , alive disease , die disease , die unknown cause ) , length follow-up record .
