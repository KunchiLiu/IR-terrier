Women must receive ≥ 1 prior hormonal treatment ( ) metastatic adjuvant setting . If recent hormonal treatment metastatic setting , duration response ( tumor regression stabilization disease ) specific course therapy must ≥ 6 month . If recent hormonal treatment adjuvant setting , duration response ( disease free ) specific course therapy must ≥ 3 year Histological cytological confirmation ER+ BC assess local laboratory use slide , paraffin block , paraffin sample medical history : ER+ ( confirm ER expression equal 1 % positive tumor nucleus ) Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative tumor local laboratory testing ( immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] 0 , 1+ regardless fluorescence situ hybridization [ FISH ] ratio ; IHC 2+ FISH ratio low 2.0 HER2 gene copy le 6.0 ; FISH ratio 0 , indicate gene deletion , positive negative situ hybridization [ ISH ] control present ) Availability paraffin embed formalin fixed tumor tissue ; OR , minimum 10 20 slide archive tumor tissue new biopsy , archive tissue unavailable central laboratory confirmation AR status molecular subtyping .
