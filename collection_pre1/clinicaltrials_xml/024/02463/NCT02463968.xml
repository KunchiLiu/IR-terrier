	<brief_summary>Chikungunya mosquito-borne viral illness lead chronic joint pain approximately one half patient . The mechanism lead long term arthritis human well establish . There evidence animal study activate macrophage persistent viral infection may play role chronic arthritis however mechanisms yet identify human . It hypothesize activated macrophage harbor persistent active chikungunya virus responsible chronic arthritis joint pain patient . The focus proposal evaluate synovial fluid blood direct viral persistence activate macrophage may clarify mechanism inflammatory injury . The result study directly applicable tailor trial therapeutic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chikungunya Arthritis Americas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chikungunya rapidly spread throughout Americas cause debilitate chronic arthritis approximately one fourth patient . There currently standard treatment chikungunya arthritis , mechanism lead chronic arthritis unclear . Further characterization disease pathophysiology need order guide evaluation potential therapeutic . It hypothesize chronic chikungunya arthritis due persistence active virus synovial fluid macrophage serve viral reservoir . The predominance activate macrophage persistently infect tissue presence viral genome within macrophage non-human primate make hypothesis plausible . To test hypothesis , study three Specific Aims . Aim 1 , describe host characteristic affect susceptibility severe persistent arthritis . Aim 2 , determine chikungunya virus persist synovial fluid synovial fluid macrophage human show non-human primate . Aim 3 , investigate macrophage may activate modulated cytokine . To date , pathophysiologic factor well characterized human . Information gain study directly lead recommendation evaluation antiviral versus immune modulate medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>There three cohort patient . Cohort 1 Chronic chikungunya : Twenty participant chronic chikungunya knee effusion define continued knee joint effusion least three month diagnosis chikungunya . Cohort 2 Acute chikungunya : Ten participant acute chikungunya define clinical symptom chikungunya acute fever &gt; 38°C joint pain within 10 day onset symptom without likely diagnosis laboratory confirm chikungunya . Cohort 3 Healthy control : Five healthy participant participate provide baseline measurement cytokine profile mononuclear cell sample recovery . All subject adults ≥18 year old . Cohort 1 participant enrol study knee effusion baseline presentation . Laboratory confirmation chikungunya include positive viral PCR positive IgM antibody . All patient able understand give inform consent Spanish . Participants exclude know bleed disorder warfarin , clopidogrel , ticagrelor therapy exclude increase bleeding risk . The study also exclude child , adult unable give consent , prisoner , pregnant woman .</criteria>
