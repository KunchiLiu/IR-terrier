About 2 tablespoon blood drawn test . - Collection list subject 's current medication , include prescription , over-the-counter medication , supplement herbal . This visit last 2 hour . If subject qualifies study , participate follow procedure : Group Assignment If researcher believe subject take part study , s/he assign randomly ( like flip coin ) receive one follow therapy : - Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Irrigation - Negative Pressure Wound Therapy without Irrigation The group assign randomly ( like flip coin ) . The sponsor researcher know advance group assignment subject receive . Neither subject researcher allow choose group s/he assign . Study Intervention The subject receive either : - Cardinal Pro +Simultaneous Irrigation ( NPWTi ) - Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Prontosan® , - Cardinal Pro ( NPWT ) Therapy ( without Prontosan® ) ( See picture Page 15 . ) Assigned therapy continue hospital physician determines wound ready closure . If subject 's wound healing , study therapy discontinue standard dressing apply . If surgical closure need , subject return Operating Room procedure close wound . If wound ready closure hospital stay , subject continue NPWT home remainder 4 week treatment . NPWT home without irrigation ( KCI VAC Via® ) . Procedures Evaluations Research The study therapy give subject hospital . S/he continue therapy 4 week wound close . Once therapy stop s/he continue follow study doctor . After subject release hospital s/he need see study doctor Every 7 day ( ±7 day ) . If subject 's wound heal 56 day his/her first surgery s/he longer take part study .
