	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , antiviral activity human monoclonal antibody , VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB ( know VRC01 ) , HIV-infected adult whose HIV well-controlled antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . The study examine whether VRC01 delay prevents return HIV viremia participant undergo brief analytical treatment interruption ( ATI ) . The study enroll HIV-infected participant 18 year old ART . ( ART provide study ) . At pre-entry study visit , participant undergo blood collection , leukapheresis procedure , rectal biopsy . The study last 34 week proceed three stage : Step 1 ( approximately 9 week ) , Step 2 ( approximately 12 week ) , Step 3 ( approximately 13 week ) . During Step 1 , participant receive three dos VRC01 via intravenous ( IV ) infusion . The first dose VRC01 give day 0 . Seven day receive first dose VRC01 , participant discontinue ART . Participants receive second third dos VRC01 day 21 42 , respectively . For 7 day VRC01 IV infusion , participant monitor record temperature symptom . In addition 3 injection study visit , participant attend weekly visit day 7 approximately day 63 ( week 9 ) . Participants enter Step 2 study resume ART confirm return HIV-1 viremia confirm CD4+ T-cell count less 350 cells/μL . Step 2 study visit occur day ART resume ( Step 2 , week 1 ) every four week thereafter ( approximately Step 2 , week 4 , 8 , 12 ) participant 's HIV viral load decrease less 50 copies/mL . Throughout study , visit include clinical assessment blood collection . Some blood store future testing . Some study visit include collection oral , rectal , ( woman ) cervical secretion sample . On day 63 , participant undergo another leukapheresis procedure rectal biopsy . Participants complete Step 2 may optionally enter Step 3 additional testing . Entry Step 3 occur least 3 month participant complete Step 2 . Step 3 participant additional study visit leukapheresis procedure , rectal biopsy , clinical follow .</detailed_description>
