	<brief_title>The Dementia Quality Life Scale Older Family Carers ( DQoL-OC ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY AIM : This study aim develop unique questionnaire evaluate quality life old people provide care family member dementia home living UK evaluate psychometric property . It aim allow researcher , health social professional , well support group ' leader , quantify experience care old age , implementation evaluation intervention older family carers aim improve QoL . STUDY DESIGN : This study carry quantitatively focus sequential exploratory mixed method ' design ( qual - &gt; QUAN ) ( Creswell Clark , 2011 ) . It multi-centre convenient sample study ( randomization ) . Focus group carry Nottinghamshire ask old family carers important QoL ( REC reference : D10072014 SoHS ) . The next study phase carry pilot re-test study use newly develop DQoL-OC validated scale . The study manage within School Health Sciences University Nottingham . SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS : The study participant ( n=300 ) recruit GP centre Memory assessment service . Research post leaflet available visible place aforementioned NHS setting family carers usually access . NHS staff may contact family carers register NHS system e-mail order inform study . Potential participant voluntarily contact PhD researcher Deborah Oliveira e-mail , work address telephone number information . The research material ( questionnaire PIS ) post pre-paid envelope participant ' address . About 25 participant take part pilot study invite answer questionnaire second time , re-test session , two week first set measure . Participants accept take part re-test sent second envelope contain research material fill post back researcher within 14 day . This second questionnaire send together first one , address storage necessary . Each participant take part study 45 minute average . If participant want participate re-test phase ( 2 week interval ) , amount time double . This research collect participant ' Informed consent ( IC ) , questionnaires utilized . Completion subsequent return questionnaire take IC separate write IC seek . Participants take part re-test receive set measure ( two week interval ) address information immediately destroy . Participants inform 30 day pilot questionnaire receive re-test measure receive , consider withdraw re-test study pilot measure consider study . Pilot study : Research data collect use research booklet contain preliminary version DQoL-OC participant also invite comment clarity , difficulty relevance overall scale use Likert scale ( 1-5 ) , possible answer range 'very clear ' 'not clear ' clarity , 'very difficult ' 'very easy ' level difficulty 'strongly relevant ' 'strongly irrelevant ' relevance , space comment question . Participants also invite comment presence possible upsetting question . In booklet , self-response questionnaire relate QoL health include order measure convergent construct validity new scale : Satisfaction Life Scale ( SWLS ) ( Diener et al. , 1985 ) ; Perceived Health Status Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) ( Weinman et al. , 1995 ) ; overall HRQoL VAS ( Torrance , 1978 , Carlsson , 1983 , EuroQol , 1990 , Bleichrodt Johannesson , 1997 , Lundberg et al. , 1999 , Shmueli , 1999 , Boer et al. , 2004 , Shmueli , 2005 ) ; World Health Organization Quality Life Scale Aging Population - The WHOQOL-AGE ( Caballero et al. , 2013 ) . The first version DQoL-OC item create base aforementioned qualitative finding submit expert ' panel evaluate relevance clarity ( face content validity ) . The preliminary version DQoL-OC divide three separate session total 100 question related 1 ) practical aspect care caregiving , 2 ) carers ' feeling concern 3 ) satisfaction life care . All question design Likert format ( 1-5 ) , range `` never '' `` always '' , `` '' `` much need '' `` satisfy '' `` dissatisfy '' . At end questionnaire two open question allow carers write affect QoL anything else cover questionnaire yet important QoL . Re-test : A small group participant ( n maximum=25 ) take part pilot study invite Researcher answer questionnaires second time , re-test session , two week first set measure . The procedure utilize pilot study apply regard participant recruitment . Participants accept take part re-test sent second envelope contain research material fill post back researcher within 14 day . This second envelope post together pilot questionnaire receive code added letter identification future comparison . Participants inform withdraw research activity wish 14 day deadline researcher 's responsibility identify another participant include re-test study case . Besides address detail , personal data collect . DATA ANALYSIS : All statistic test develop SPSS 22 statistic package , confidence interval 95 % significant p-value ≤ 0.05 . Descriptive ( frequency , mean , median , mode , standard deviation ) , suitable correlation statistic ( ANOVA ) ceiling floor effect calculate variable . The participant ' subjective view regard clarity , relevance , level difficulty new scale DQoL-OC analyse use Kappa coefficient , order provide average score agreement among participant overall instrument ( Streiner Norman , 1995 , Rubio et al. , 2003 , Leung et al. , 2005 , Polit Beck , 2006 , Nagpal et al. , 2010 , Wassef et al. , 2014 , Landis Koch , 1977 ) . Aiming determine whether DQoL-OC ass construct QoL valid reliable instrument select literature , construct validity DQoL-OC evaluate suitable correlation statistic ( ANOVA ) , correlate DQoL-OC score validate scale complete participant , previously mention . In addition , Factor analysis ( FA ) use explore inter relationship variable refine reduce instrument . For FA , besides sample size , strengths inter-correlations item also must consider . First necessary inspect correlation matrix evaluate suitability data FA ( ≥ 0.30 ) ( Tabachnick Fidell , 1996 ) . In addition , extent Kaiser-Meyer-Oklin sample adequacy perform ( ≥ 0.60 ) ( Kaiser Caffey , 1965 , Kaiser , 1970 , Dziuban Shirkey , 1974 ) significance Bartlett 's Test Sphericity correlation ( Bartlett , 1954 ) analyse support factorability correlation matrix . According result , data submit FA modify suitable FA . To give estimate equivalence set item instrument , base assumption item measure construct correlate , internal consistency DQoL-OC calculate use Cronbach 's coefficient . Finally , aim evaluate whether measurement provide DQoL-OC stable time , two set measure participant take part re-test compare use Kappa coefficient , score ≥ 0.60 good re-test reliability . The closer result , great test-retest reliability DQoL-OC . The data analysis take place UoN computer back UoN server . SAMPLE SIZE AND JUSTIFICATION : There agreement literature regard appropriate sample size use conduct factor analysis ( Mundfrom et al. , 2005 ) . Even though big sample size ( n &gt; 500 ) indicative good factor discrimination ( Costello Osborne , 2005 ) several study show adequate sample size partly determine nature data number participant , mean strong data , small sample necessary accurate analysis ( Fabrigar et al. , 1999 , MacCallum et al. , 1999 ) . Strong data factor analysis associate uniformly high communalities without cross loading several variable load strongly , characteristic consider rare ( Costello Osborne , 2005 ) . Although absolute minimum sample size often presented literature , general , small sample size accept high level communality within data high ratio number variable number factor ( Mundfrom et al. , 2005 ) . Mundfrom et al . ( 2005 ) stress small number variable require large minimum sample size large number variable , relation minimum necessary sample size number variable seem compensator , relation minimum necessary sample size ratio number variable number factor . These author propose low communality factor within matrix study , minimum acceptable sample size would 200 participant . Accordingly , stipulate maximum 300 participant pilot study , consider factor communality study still unknown also careful possibility miss data . The n=25 reliability re-test also follow recommendation available literature ( Sim Wright , 2005 ) . Besides sample size , strengths inter-correlations item evaluate Bartlett test Sphericity extent Kaiser-Meyer-Oklin ( KMO ) sample adequacy also use assess adequacy data FA . The data submit FA modify suitability FA . If study need big sample size , Ethics Committee contact approval exceed number participant seek recruitment carers . DATA DISSEMINATION : The finding study write part PhD thesis University Nottingham submission date expect September 2016 . The result may submit publication peer review journal academic scientific event . The data provide participant anonymous answer participant receive specific code Chief investigator co-investigators access . The data may also use inform future research policy . The participant stakeholder may receive fed back result anonymity .</detailed_description>
