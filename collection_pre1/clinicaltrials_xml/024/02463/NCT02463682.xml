	<brief_title>Early Feasibility Study Zone-MPC HMS With DiAs Outpatient Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This feasibility study artificial pancreas ( AP ) system previously validate Zone-MPC Health Monitoring System ( HMS ) algorithm ( ClinicalTraisl.gov : NCT01929798 ) integrate Diabetes Assistant ( DiAs ) system . The system evaluate 2-3 subject per site ( n=6-9 subject ) 2 week 3 different site ( William Sansum Diabetes Center , University Virginia , Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN ) . Basal rate adjust run-to-run manner study physician prior closed-loop phase maximum 3 week . Subjects complete 2 week home use Zone-MPC/HMS system use DIAs platform closed-loop feasibility trial . The purpose pilot study establish safe day-and-night use Zone-MPC/HMS system integrate DiAs achievable home environment , analyze learn improve upon run-to- run optimization process , collect efficacy data inform future large study .</detailed_description>
