	<brief_summary>The pathophysiology vertigo complex usually require specialist involvement . During diagnostic process , patient commonly undergo test assess integrity gaze posture stabilisation mechanism involve inner ear ( vestibular system ) , visual system subconscious neural pathway interconnect . Whilst test useful fail provide information concern neural connection cortex therefore neglect perceptual aspect disequilibrium . At present possibility routine examination high projection remain elusive practical alternative expensive functional magnetic resonance image system exist . However , recently novel method record cortical vestibular evoke potential ( CVEPs ) describe . CVEPs utilise exist method use interrogate cortical projection auditory system sound wave stimulate inner ear result electrical response brain record . The recent breakthrough realisation response also contain information balance organ therefore direct measure cortical processing vestibular input . Current evidence show CVEPs present normal population absent patient vestibular function . The primary aim study extend patient cohort include vestibular injury retain residual function . Patients go standard test also CVEPs ears provide seminal information effect injury peripheral vestibular system cortical pathway . Furthermore , follow cohort complete management pathway possible ascertain CVEP use predict rehabilitation outcome success .</brief_summary>

The investigator aim record data 36 ear vestibular dysfunction . A ) Patients receive consultation ENT Consultant Registrar per standard practice . B ) If patient deem doctor otoneurological cause symptom audiovestibular test image arrange per standard practice . The patient make aware study interest give opportunity discus chief investigator ( CI ) principal investigator ( PI ) . C ) If agreeable patient give information pack PI/CI take study . D ) The patient leave consultation information pack ask consider participation study . They obligation take part contact member research team ask information question answer . E ) Upon return audiovestibular test patient inform CI/PI wish participate study additional test end test sequence . This add approximately 30 minute appointment time . F ) Patients suitable rehabilitation ( per standard care pathway ) go ahead course treatment subsequent visit ( ) . The outcome follow treatment log correlate CVEP check correlation may may present . Otologically normal ear : Normative data collect 36 normal ear subject history audiovestibular symptom investigate balance disorder . Healthy control recruited via poster advertisement potential participant ask contact research team consider take part .</detailed_description>
