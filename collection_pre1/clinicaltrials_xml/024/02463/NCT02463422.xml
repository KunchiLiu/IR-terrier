	<brief_summary>According recent report Centers Disease Control , child ASD receive diagnosis begin receive treatment well 4th birthday , unfortunate give many connection brain cell already establish age . This program test model call Get S.E.T . Early ( S=Screen , E=Evaluate , T=Treat ) San Diego Phoenix , design detect , evaluate , treat ASD within first 2 year life . In proposal 7,500 toddler general population screen San Diego Phoenix ( total 15,000 ) use CSBS IT Checklist ( Wetherby &amp; Prizant , 2002 ) well baby check-ups use `` triple screen '' approach wherein toddler screen three age start 12 month . Investigators predict provide screening tool clear cut-off score guideline automatic referral evaluation treatment result dramatically lower mean age detection Phoenix 4-5 year 1-2 year . Investigators also predict use repeat screen 12 , 18 , &amp; 24 month combination automatic referral option via technology ( i-Pads ) result increase number ASD toddler detect 24 month relative single time point screen use traditional paper screen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection ASD 1st Birthday Standard Care : The Get SET Early Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators previously demonstrate early intervention model system , center use CSBS IT Checklist screen baby 1-year check-up standard care , result mean age 12 month screen , 14 month evaluation , 18 month treatment participation . These far young age common U.S . The 3-stage model system , Get SET ( S=Screen ; E=Evaluate ; T=Treat ) Early , screen &gt; 10,000 1 year old first trial run detect 100 ASD developmental delay toddler . The current grant build highly effective model implement new version two major city : San Diego Phoenix ; data mine electronic record Kaiser pediatric office Los Angeles Irvine provide control data . In Phoenix , investigator test feasibility establish Get SET Early model city one low median income old age first diagnosis America . In AIM # 1 , Screen Refer Early stage , investigator create Pediatrician Network 100 member Phoenix . In San Diego investigator utilize exist Pediatrician Network test new innovation repeat `` triple screen '' 12 , 18 , 24 month ensure toddler miss . Speed referral evaluation compare contrast use parent ( self ) automatic ( referral i-Pad App ) option . Investigators track every toddler eventual ASD diagnosis within circumscribed medical group determine true sensitivity specificity screen tool percentage ASD toddler detect model . Anonymous survey data regard screen habit administer parent pediatrician . AIM # 2 implement Evaluate Refer Early stage . Its key attribute ASD Early Evaluation Clinic specialize rapid schedule evaluation every refer screen positive toddler . Toddlers enter program age fail screen ( i.e. , 12 , 18 24 month ) thoroughly diagnostically evaluate track per year turn 3 year . This specialty Clinic Autism Center San Diego develop SARRC Phoenix . Automated versus optional self-referral treatment test compare . AIM # 3 implement Treat Early stage . Its key attribute network provider empirically base treatment innovative use inexpensive readily available web-based treatment track system document engagement . Treatment Networks create San Diego Phoenix . Primary outcome measure include rate age screen referral , evaluation referral , treatment engagement ; sustainability across year ; diagnostic , clinical demographic characteristic subject ; professional parent satisfaction stage . Investigators hypothesize provide screening tool clear cut-off score guideline automatic referral evaluation treatment , result dramatically lower mean age diagnosis treatment Phoenix 4-5 year 1-2 year ; San Diego likewise mean age 1-2 year diagnosis treatment make significantly earlier non-intervention contrast city .</detailed_description>
