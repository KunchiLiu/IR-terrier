	<brief_title>A Trial Determine Effects Exercise Inflammatory Bowel Disease Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The benefit exercise plentiful ( 1 ) . They physical , psychological social . Exercise exhibit effect multiple system multiple mechanism . These mechanism often poorly understood . Long-term resistance training result many health benefit . It associate reduce risk low-grade inflammatory disease , improve metabolic profile patient type two diabetes prevention osteoporosis ( 2 , 3 ) . The mean resistance train achieves fully understood . A study paediatric patient Inflammatory Bowel Disease find patient cohort tolerate high intensity exercise well ( 4 ) . Regular exercise could help improve disease activity Inflammatory Bowel Disease release anti-inflammatory cytokine myocytes exercise . Intestinal microbiota think key link disease expression human ( 5 ) . Previous study show aerobic exercise obese adolescent lead particular alteration intestinal microbiota ( 6 ) . These alteration appear relate weight loss experience . This may determine quantity weight body fat lose adolescent . Persistent resistance aerobic exercise also lead change baseline immunological profile , particularly cytokine ( 7 ) . The investigator aim explore relationship alteration intestinal microbiota follow structure mixed cardio-respiratory strength training exercise program correlation change cytokine profile , percentage body fat lost disease activity . Hypothesis : 1 . A structured , 8-week mixed cardio-respiratory resistance training exercise program result specific change intestinal microbiota inactive disease population . 2 . For inactive individual , change intestinal microbiota follow 8-week exercise program associate change immunological profile . 3 . Adjusting amount exercise perform , great decrease percentage body fat associate presence particular intestinal microbiota change exercise . 4 . Enhanced disease control , mood anxiety state occur follow 8-week exercise program . This associated change intestinal microbiota immunological profile . Study design : - Prospective , randomize control trial - Interventional Following identification appropriate patient subsequent recruitment IBD RA patient equally randomize 2 group 1:1 ratio . The first group enter 8-week exercise program immediately measure timepoint 0 - week 0 - timepoint 1 - week 8 . The second group enter delay 8-week exercise program first complete 8-week period maintain usual level low physical activity . These patient measure timepoint 0 , timepoint 1 timepoint 2 . Sample Size : The investigator seek recruit participant follow group 1 . Inflammatory Bowel Disease , Ulcerative Colitis Crohn 's - 30 patient total 2 . Rheumatoid Arthritis - 30 patient Randomization process : Subjects randomize 8-week exercise 16-week usual physical activity + exercise group selection appropriately mark envelope contain group number recruit . Subjects recruit 1:1 basis 8 week study : 16-week study respectively . Randomization occur initial screen visit witness subject 2 investigator . Intervention : A minimum standardized , mixed cardio-respiratory resistance training exercise program attempt adhere . An individualized exercise program deliver safety mind . This program suitable beginner base around basic `` couch 5km '' exercise plan identical use previous research study , ExMET study . In experience participant enjoy program progress well , despite baseline inactivity . Subjects allow progress program supervision gym instructor investigator . Free weight include exercise program . For resistance exercise subject initially require perform 1 2 set 8 12 repetition 70 % 1 Repetition max . This increase 3 set 8 12 repetition . An appropriate warm encourage minimize injury . Gym instructor available site throughout exercise program assistance individual query regard exercise program , record activity FITLINXX gym machinery . - Type exercise : Aerobic resistance train - Options include walking/running treadmill , stationary cycling , cross trainer , stepper machine aerobic training . Resistance exercise comprise 6-8 different machine base exercise focus core muscle strength well upper low body muscle group e.g . chest press , leg extension . - Intensity : Moderate vigorous intensity per Borg perceive exertion scale . - Duration : 18 20 - minute aerobic session initially escalate weekly guide standard couch 5km protocol . - Frequency : Three training session per week . - Length : 8 week . Methodology : After recruitment , completion inform consent process screen inclusion exclusion criterion , patient ask attend 2 3 measurement visit depend randomization . These visit take place Clinical Sciences Building Cork University Hospital . Confidential demographic data collect subject , include subject 's sex , age , race , weight height . Information regard medical history current medical status subject obtain . Validated questionnaire medication adherence i.e . Morisky adherence scale , physical activity self-perceived stress : Beck Depression Inventory , Hospital Anxiety Depression scale State/trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires well quality life questionnaire include SF-36 fill . Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry scanning conduct measure body composition include percentage body fat . Patients complete detailed dietary survey Food Frequency Questionnaire similar carry recent study centre ( 8 ) . Disease activity patient assess clinical exam history . Disease activity index score , Harvey Bradshaw Crohn 's Disease , Powell-Tuck Ulcerative Colitis DAS-28-CRP RA record . Following measurement appropriate warm , individual undergo Rockport one-mile walk test establish baseline level fitness estimate VO2 max . This sub-maximal fitness test entail participant walk one mile brisk pace without stop . They time end procedure individual 's heart rate measure . An estimated VO2 max calculate base previous validated study ( 9 ) . This test conduct consistent reliable environmental condition indoor track Mardyke Arena . Following thesis procedure measurement , subject familiarize exercise program equipment within Mardyke arena . Subjects attend 90-minute induction session dedicate gym instructor Mardyke Arena . During session instructor demonstrate safe appropriate use equipment , illustrate correct technique resistance exercise . In order keep record exercise session conduct 8-week exercise program , participant show correctly record individual activity FITLINXX activity monitoring system , adjacent machine Mardyke Arena . Subjects ample opportunity try practice machine well measure 1 repetition max . value require individual muscle strengthen goal . Training program compliance monitor examine weekly downloads subject 's logged exercise activity Mardyke arena . For subject maintain minimum exercise requirement , subject contact telephone facilitate ensure progress match minimum standard follow week . If achieve subject wish withdraw study , long involve study . Outcome measure : - Change Intestinal Microbiota virome - Intestinal microbiota virome sample faecal sample provide subject . These store characterized quantify . Bile acid profile ( faecal , blood urinary profile ) analyze begin end study see potential change exercise . This perform APC , University College Cork Teagasc Moorepark , Fermoy . - Resting level immunological marker ( cytokine TNF alpha , IL-6 ) time point program . - Change glucose cholesterol profile response exercise . - Proof change fitness - Predicted VO2 max via 1-mile walk test ( Rockport test ) . - Change percentage body fat - DEXA - Total body composition scan perform CUH . - Basic Biochemistry Haematology include CRP creatine kinase - Weight , height , BMI waist/hip measurement . - Food frequency diary include alcohol consumption measure week 0 week 8 . - Urinary , faecal blood microbial metabolomics measure timepoint - Disease activity score - measure validated disease activity index ; Harvey-Bradshaw Index patient Crohn 's Disease Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index well Powell-Tuck Index patient Ulcerative Colitis . For patient RA DAS-28 CRP score calculate . - Quality life , mood Anxiety Scores record : The Beck depression inventory , Hospital Anxiety Depressions Scale ( HADS ) , State/Trait Anxiety Inventory use monitor change mood/ anxiety . The Short form-36 ( SF 36 ) use monitor quality life change . Overall Statistical Data Analysis : The investigator access sophisticated biostatistical analysis platform generate association base upon diverse criterion .</detailed_description>
