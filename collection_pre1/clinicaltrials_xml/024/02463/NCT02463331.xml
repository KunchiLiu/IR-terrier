	<brief_summary>The gold-standard treatment Autoimmune hepatitis ( AIH ) , prednisone alone conjunction azathioprine reach resolution disease 70-80 % case US . However , Brazil response treatment seem bad , approximately 35 % five year . Because side effect gold-standard treatment need alternative option responsive patient , news drug must evaluate proposal . Chloroquine diphosphate antimalarial drug use treatment rheumatological disease least five decade . Chloroquine use single drug two year maintenance AIH remission open study . There 6.49 great chance relapse historical control compare patient treat chloroquine ( 72.2 % x 23.5 % ; p = 0.031 ) .

	<brief_title>Possible Role Chloroquine Induce Complete Remission Treatment Autoimmune Hepatitis : Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoimmune hepatitis ( AIH ) chronic disease progressive destruction hepatic parenchyma , lead cirrhosis high mortality absence specific treatment . It demonstrate treatment corticosteroid azathioprine provide clinical laboratory improvement , reduction histological inflammatory activity liver biopsy increase survival . Because side effect gold-standard treatment need alternative option responsive patient , news drug must evaluate proposal . Chloroquine drug group 4-aminoquinolines , synthetic derivative quinine constituent bark Cinchona tree . Chloroquine accumulate tissue considerable amount . In animal , 200 700 time plasma concentration find liver , spleen , kidneys lung . As weak base , accumulate intracellularly , particularly lysosomes consequent increase pH within organelle , could contribute toxicity . Lysosomal lamellar body observe tissue affected chloroquine , retina neuromuscular system . Chloroquine inhibit absorption bind mitochondrial calcium , alters membrane permeability transport enzymes lysosomes . Apparently mechanisms explain anti-inflammatory action ; interference release TNF mononuclear phagocytes inhibit gene expression down-regulation TNF receptor , delay transport cellular surface . Due mechanism action , chloroquine anti-inflammatory activity therefore use disease rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus . In liver disease , chloroquine use patient hepatitis B normalization level aminotransferases prothrombin time treatment relapse drug discontinuation . Chloroquine also evaluate patient porphyria cutanea tarda despite clinical biochemical improvement , liver biopsy remain unchanged one year treatment . A previous pilot study perform institution , publish 2005 , chloroquine diphosphate maintenance treatment AIH . In study , 14 patient biochemical histological remission treat chloroquine diphosphate 250 mg/day least 12 month disease recurrence , compare 18 historical control , hold discontinuation treatment remission . The chance relapse 6.49 time higher historical control compare patient group treat chloroquine ( 72.2 % versus 23.5 % , p = 0.031 ) . The use chloroquine safe patient liver cirrhosis without decompensation , serious adverse event within two year use . The common adverse effect chloroquine mild transient gastrointestinal symptom , headache , dizziness , blurry vision fatigue . The severe reaction describe itch , cardiovascular manifestation , dyskinesia , eye injury , neuromuscular disorder hear loss . Among feared adverse effect chloroquine , eye injury , usually associate chronic treatment . They may consist change retina , lens , cornea optic nerve . Usually remain stable drug withdrawal , drug discontinue early stage . However , retinal damage increase find advanced stage , may progress even year cessation chloroquine . It believe chloroquine retinopathy prevent recognize early reversible stage judicious use , appropriate dos regular ophthalmologic follow-up . It recommend daily dose exceed 250 mg chloroquine diphosphate 400 mg hydroxychloroquine , ophthalmologic evaluation carry every 4 6 month . Despite adverse effect toxic reaction describe , consensus study chloroquine well tolerate drug , provide appropriate dosage guideline regular eye examination follow . With caution mind , use rarely cause serious side irreversible effect . The aim study investigate whether chloroquine conjunction prednisone use alternative treatment AIH randomize study , evaluate side effect . To include patient satisfy follow criterion simultaneously : diagnosis probable / definite AIH indication treatment ( accord International AIH Group ) , normal liver function absence clinical sign decompensated liver disease ( ascites , hepatic encephalopathy , gastrointestinal bleeding hepatocellular carcinoma ) . For enrollment , necessary patient accordance propose study , follow precept Declaration Helsinki . If patient refuse participate study , treat follow traditional guideline service . Treatment discontinue case pregnancy , patient 's desire , side-effects relapse AIH . Patients randomize receive azathioprine prednisone chloroquine prednisone . The alternative treatment , chloroquine , maintain unless caused major side-effects , biochemical response treatment failure . In case , azathioprine introduce association prednisone . All patient visit every 30 day first six month routine blood test perform . After , consultation every two month . All complaint record . Every patient treat doctor responsible study , laboratory test perform Central Laboratory hospital . All patient underwent initial ophthalmologic evaluation follow six-monthly evaluation . The drug withdrawal , change suggestive retinopathy observe .</detailed_description>
