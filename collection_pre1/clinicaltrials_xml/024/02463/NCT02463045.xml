	<brief_title>Study Safety Tolerability TOP1288 Administered Rectally Healthy Ulcerative Colitis Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TOP1288 , narrow spectrum protein kinase inhibitor , develop novel , non-absorbed treatment ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . UC disease unknown cause characterise inflammation line large intestine manifest abdominal pain bloody diarrhoea . TOP1288 give rectally local anti-inflammatory action experimental model UC . The present study first time TOP1288 give human explores safety , tolerability body handle ( absorbs , distribute eliminates ) TOP1288 seek evidence biochemical effect drug body . The study three part : Part 1 investigates single dos group healthy volunteer , group dose increase dose provide drug safe well tolerate previous level . Part 2 investigates multiple ascend dos healthy volunteer group dose increase dose provide drug safe well tolerate previous level . Part 3 investigate one dose level administer dose patient volunteer UC . The study design adaptive - first dose level Part 1 , predefined , exact dose dose-intervals modify pre-set plan Safety Review Committee light emerge result .</detailed_description>
