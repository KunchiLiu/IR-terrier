	<brief_summary>Adolescents particularly vulnerable psychological problem , partly dramatic change brain , along change social interaction pattern move childhood towards adulthood . One common problem anxiety , affect 1 4 adolescent . Moreover , paediatric anxiety predicts lifelong persistent mental health problem , estimate cost UK taxpayer £8.6 billion annually . Young people anxiety experience intense fear worry , lead problem friendship , poor school performance , long-term mental health difficulty . Research investigate young people develop anxiety therefore critically need strategy early intervention develop . This research test hypothesis use novel training intervention , - teach participant change way brain respond emotional stimulus - allow investigator influence response strategy establish possibly reduce risk anxiety long run . To achieve , investigator test 50 adolescent female ( age 14-17 year ) vary anxiety level investigate whether brain response emotion regulation region up/down regulate use fMRI-based neurofeedback.The rationale behind research approach successful change brain response may provide participant additional , 'bodily ' feel respond emotional stimulus real life situation , thereby pave path towards development effective , age-appropriate intervention approach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study part workpackage 4 Braintrain project ( EU-FP7 n°602186 ) , respond huge clinical need mechanism-driven therapy psychiatry . Advances neuroimaging neuroscience technique produce wealth information neural network contribute disorder treatment ( Linden , 2012 ) . This information harness pinpoint dysfunction potential compensatory mechanism individual patient . It important choice neuroimaging technique major node disorder network deep region brain subcortical nucleus ( amygdala nucleus accumbens ) and/or midline cortical region ( medial prefrontal cortex , subgenual cingulate cortex , retrosplenial cortex ) , difficult probe via EEG alone . Through development fMRI-based NF ( henceforth NF ) technique last decade collaboration member consortium ( Weiskopf et al. , 2004a ; Weiskopf et al. , 2004b ) , become realistic proposition train patient self-regulation network thus obtain clinical benefit ( deCharms , 2007 ) . In addition therapeutic option , NF also take investigation neural mechanism mental disorder new level allow investigator establish causal relationship change regional activity assess effect behaviour mental state real-time . In current study , investigator aim provide proof concept use NF adolescent vary anxiety level age 14-17 year . Anxiety disorder common , estimated lifetime prevalence 10-25 % , often begin late childhood/early adolescence . There currently effective prevention programme current treatment yield variable outcome . Improving understanding mechanism anxiety disorder first develop inform design effective targeted intervention prevention . The transition adolescence may mark one developmentally-sensitive juncture onset lifelong persistent anxiety problem , new intervention NF may particularly effective ( Cohen Kadosh et al. , 2013 ) . Particularly , suggest increased emotionality ongoing development neuro-cognitive base emotion regulation ability adolescence may one factor contribute increase risk anxiety disorder age group ( Haller et al. , press ) . This study build previous work investigator , establish suitability use NF paediatric population ( Cohen Kadosh et al. , preparation ) . Specifically , , investigator use NF train 50 adolescent girl vary anxiety level increase effective connectivity neural network involve emotion regulation ability ( Cohen Kadosh et al. , preparation ; Kohn et al. , 2014 ; Ruiz et al. , 2013 ) . The rationale approach improve information flow brain region , emotion regulation ability also improve . Moreover , investigator hope able show turn , improvement emotion regulation ability affect overall anxiety level . Last , recruit participant across wide range anxiety level , investigator also able assess variation regulation success function individual anxiety level .</detailed_description>
