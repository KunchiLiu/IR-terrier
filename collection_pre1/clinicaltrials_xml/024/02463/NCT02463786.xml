	<brief_summary>Heart failure ( HF ) remain poor outcome . Even though recent advance HF lead reduction morbidity mortality , improvement outcome much less expect base large randomized trial . Various reason may responsible , complexity disease comorbidities , inadequate diagnosis inappropriate treatment . So far , little attention pay patient see primary care . Also , HF care mainly focus individual patient-doctor relationship . However , increase complexity prevents individual physician cover aspect care . Consequently , multiple stakeholder involve , include general practitioner specialist . Still , relative role , interaction process include hardly define . These aspect may relevant patient care , also setup health care system . Whereas multidisciplinary team resemble seamless system across primary hospital care , scarcity research consider disease management program perform , form offer , care support patient caregiver would benefit most.The INTERACT-in HF ( Improving kNowldege Transfer Efficaciously RAise level Contemporary Treatment Heart Failure ) study set determine ass relevant factor quality HF care . The study evaluate process HF care , role relevant care giver interaction . It collect data individual patient assess characteristic management contemporary HF patient . This perform different country ( Netherlands , Belgium Germany ) analyze decision making respect diagnostics treatment.Cross-sectional mixed-methods use . Patients caregiver interview . The patient central start point . Then , treat GP , cardiologist HF nurse interviewed . In parallel , retrospective data base record patient review verify data interview determine characteristic . Retrospective data additional patient collect complete picture current situation . These data use define bottleneck prevent best clinical practice use daily care level , compare practice different countries.Thus , proposal aim good understand HF care , lead good care finally improve outcome .</brief_summary>
