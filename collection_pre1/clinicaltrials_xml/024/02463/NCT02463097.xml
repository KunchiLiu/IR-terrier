	<brief_title>Hybrid Closed Loop Pivotal Trial Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study proceed follow : Run-in Period : A total 150 subject ( age 14 - 75 ) enrol 10 investigational center ( 9 US , 1 Europe , Middle East Africa ( EMEA ) region ) order reach 100 subject complete HCL study . The 2-week run-in period use allow subject become familiar new study device . During two week run-in period subject use Study Pump ( 670G ) Sensor Augmented Pump function activate ( i.e . SmartGuard OFF HCL OFF ) . Study Period - At Home : Following two week run-in period use Study Pump ( 670G ) , subject participate 3-month study period . Subjects require companion night duration study period . Companions need roof , necessarily bedroom . During Hotel stay subject monitor closely , presence companion necessary . Study Period - Hotel Study Subjects participate Hotel study ( 6 day , 5 night ) , remainder study period spend home . All subject undergo daytime nighttime Frequent Sample Testing ( FST ) approximately 24 hour Hotel study YSI i-STAT® use reference value . With respect meal , subject allow eat normally . Continued Access Program Subjects give opportunity extend use study device period 2 year . If subject choose participate continuation period , retain study device end study period visit receive back event return study staff already . During continuation period , subject come office visit every 3 month . At quarterly visit , subject ask occurrence adverse event device complaint .</detailed_description>
