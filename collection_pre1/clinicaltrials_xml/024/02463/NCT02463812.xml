	<brief_summary>Surgery put lot stress body , recovery surgery , body use lot energy help heal get strong . Often , sugar give surgery help give body energy boost . Lipid solution also use energy source commonly use supplement patient need long-term nutrition intravenous route ( e.g. , total parenteral nutrition ) eat mouth medical reason . Intralipid , solution lipid molecule soybean egg , commonly use patient need nutrition energy supplement . The investigator wish test whether give Intralipid immediately surgery improve recovery major surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The perioperative event associate major surgery trigger body 's stress response , compromise optimal post-surgical recovery outcome . Moreover , traditional perioperative indication , restrict food two day surgery , show associated poor outcome follow surgery . The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) protocol , initiate early 2000 's , aim address problem . The ERAS protocol recommendation pre- , intra- , post-operative stage , goal modify physiological psychological response surgery . A key component ERAS perioperative nutrition , include avoidance fasting surgery carbohydrate load two hour pre-surgery . It hypothesize adequate nutrition provision energy source perioperative period attenuate body 's stress response surgery , thereby enable faster successful recovery . Early post-operative feeding another recommendation ERAS also intend ensure optimal metabolic balance . Post-operative nutrition ERAS patient generally involve oral feed energy-dense nutritional supplement day surgery patient ready normal food intake . Lipids carbohydrates form bulk supplement , provide readily available energy source . Lipid emulsion , Intralipid速 , use commonly total parenteral nutrition also indicate energy source patient usual intravenous fluid therapy would adequate . Lipid emulsion alone may therefore helpful enhance recovery follow major surgery , particularly patient good candidate strict ERAS protocol . With respect short-term outcome follow surgery , Intralipid show modulate blood pressure increase systemic vascular resistance cardiac output . Only one study far evaluate post-surgery recovery outcomes follow administration lipid emulsion exclusively . The investigator find patient receive intravenous infusion lipid emulsion experience good overall recovery faster time eye open exit operating room compare patient receive infusion 0.9 % normal saline . While result suggest post-operative lipid delivery improve recovery , study ass difference basic vital sign two group , subject limit undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy . In study , investigator recruit patient undergo surgery abdomen ass post-operative outcome , include vital sign , follow intravenous bolus Intralipid速 20 % 0.9 % normal saline . OBJECTIVE To demonstrate patient receive intravenous bolus Intralipid速 20 % immediately follow surgery experience improve post-surgical recovery compare patient receive intravenous saline bolus . HYPOTHESIS The investigator hypothesize patient receive intravenous bolus Intralipid速 follow major abdominal surgery show stable vital sign faster discharge recovery room compare patient receive saline bolus .</detailed_description>
