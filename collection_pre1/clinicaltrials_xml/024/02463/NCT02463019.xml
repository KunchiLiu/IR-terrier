	<brief_title>Roll-over After 3-year Trial Tenofovir Mild Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The indication start NUCs remain controversial non-cirrhotic compensated patient chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) . Specifically , clarify whether high serum concentration HBV DNA warrant treatment despite mild elevation serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) . In order elucidate unresolved issue , 've conduct double blind placebo control randomized trial investigate efficacy Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate ( TDF ) CHB patient high viral load mildly elevate serum ALT . This open-label rollover study extension aforementioned randomized trial . For initially randomize placebo later receive open-label TDF , rare opportunity study efficacy TDF use patient his/her control . For already randomize TDF trial , investigator able closely monitor aspect therapeutic response ( i.e. , biochemical , virological , serological , histological ) 6-year treatment course Asian cohort . Regardless initial treatment assignment , enrol patient offer unique opportunity explore effectiveness TDF CHB pair biopsied liver tissue comprehensive information . Objectives : The primary endpoint study evolution liver fibrosis therapeutic course . The secondary endpoint virological response include serum viral load also intracellular HBV marker viral covalently close circular ( ccc ) DNA , serological response include HBsAg seroconversion , HBeAg seroconversion , quantification HBsAg , biochemical response AST , ALT , adverse reaction particular attention clinical event regard bone renal safety . Occurrence drug resistance also important end point . Methods : After enrollment , patient interview structured questionnaire obtain information regard demographic data , social-economic status , life style , medical history . Physical checkup , hemogram , blood biochemistry , serology HBV , serum viral load , HBV genotype , abdominal sonography perform baseline . Enrolled patient follow telephone interview every 4 week physically examine every 12 week . At follow-up visit , patient instruct return untaken drug . A patient define compliant completes least 80 % drug . AST , ALT , HBV DNA , quantitative HBsAg measure every 12 week . Serum biochemistry ( bilirubin , PT , P , K , Cre ) , urinalysis , alpha-fetoprotein , HBeAg , anti-HBe abdominal sonography measure every 24 week . Hemogram anti-HBs check annually . Percutaneous liver biopsy perform begin project complete 3-year ( 156 week ) trial period . Serology HBV ( HBsAg , anti-HBs , HBeAg , anti-HBe ) determine commercially available immunoassay ( ABBOTT GmbH &amp; Co. , Wiesbaden , Germany ) . Serum HBV DNA measure quantitatively quantitative polymerase chain reaction method ( Roche COBAS TaqMan Assay ) . Histopathological specimen obtain liver biopsy evaluate independently two central histopathologists unaware patient ' clinical information . The final report liver histology base agreement two pathologist necessary third pathologist may invite settle disagreement . Analysis Both Intent-to-treat ( ITT ) per-protocol ( PP ) analyse performed assess therapeutic efficacy . All randomized patient include ITT analysis protocol violator ( compliance le 80 % , loss follow-up , withdrawal study ) exclude PP analysis . Quantitative data summarize mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) categorical variable percentage . Fisher 's exact test use compare proportion categorical variable . Unpaired paired student 's t-tests use compare mean continuous variable group within group respectively . The investigator apply multiple logistic regression analysis investigate factor associate therapeutic efficacy . All test two-tailed p value le 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
