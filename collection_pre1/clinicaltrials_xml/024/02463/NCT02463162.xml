	<brief_summary>The Canadian population age people live advanced chronic disease . At end life ( EOL ) , use invasive medical treatment hospital increase associated bad outcome . Advance Care Planning ( ACP ) may help improve care EOL way patient want . ACP process people think various option related future health care decision may communicate verbal write plan care would want EOL . Also , may nominate substitute decision maker become unable speak . A national poll find Canadians think make ACP . Alberta Health Services develop two video ( Videos ) help decision make ACP goal care designation ( GCD ) . GCD medical order care ( ) serve communication tool HCP assist rapid decision making ; ( b ) guide HCP patient regard general intent location care , intervention provide . This study compare ACP behaviour GCD preference participant see Videos measure change behaviours preference 1 , 2 3 month . It also look impact Videos health care cost service use . Participants five patient group ( metastatic lung cancer , colorectal cancer , gynecological cancer , renal failure , heart failure ) select representative ACP ideally occur , data ACP implementation presently lack , venue research feasible . Collecting information patient ' ACP GCD preference may help improve AHS decision making tool generally help healthcare leader plan way good engage patient ACP process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Advance Care Planning ( ACP ) &amp; Goals Care Designations ( GCD ) Discussions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Respecting patient ' preference treatment key component high quality end life care . Alberta Health Services ( AHS ) develop tool public , patient healthcare provider ( HCP ) engagement education ( guidebook , video , HCP training module ) support widespread engagement advance care planning ( ACP ) determine Goals Care Designation ( GCD ) . However , none knowledge translation ( KT ) tool validate tailored reflect barrier local context . ACP define communication process people plan time make medical decision . It include think communicate preference future healthcare , include conversation family healthcare provider , choose document alternate decision maker , and/or document preference healthcare use event person lose capacity medical decision-making . These discussion occur informally formally . Goals Care Designations ( GCD ) medical order care ( ) serve communication tool HCP assist rapid decision making ; ( b ) guide HCP patient regard general intent location care , intervention provide . Decisions goal care usually arise time conversation patient , family member health care team . This randomize controlled trial focus two Conversations Matter Video decision-aids develop AHS people family . The first video 8-minute video describe 5-steps ACP process . The second video 8-minute video illustrate resuscitative , medical comfort level care outline Alberta GCD policy . Scope : This protocol relate two research activity design evaluate impact ACP/GCD . The first RCT evaluate effectiveness two video ACP GCD . Participants recruit setting ACP ideally occur , data ACP implementation presently lack . The overall aim RCT evaluate refine exist knowledge translation ( KT ) tool optimize quality frequency patient education engagement ACP determine goal care . The second activity measure economic impact Videos patient population . A significant proportion health care resource consume end life . ACP , emphasize discussion , combine GCD , may great impact advance directive alone . To clear , primary goal ACP cost containment , rather , shift culture care toward patient- family-centered approach medical decision-making . Prospective data collection analysis give insight personal intangible cost . It allow relatively precise measurement health care saving , thereby inform health care system anticipate saving prescribe shift funding necessary appropriate resourcing part health care system may see increased activity ACP , also improve quality patient-centred outcome . Methods : The RCT in-person intervention survey baseline , follow-up telephone survey one month two month , in-person survey three month . At baseline , researcher assess function ask demographic information , quality life , advance care planning ( ACP ) , goal care ( GC ) preferences goal care designation order ( GCD ) . Participants randomize two arm : 1. control `` usual care '' ; 2. intervention whereby participant view two video ACP GCD , respectively ( Videos ) . Surveys administer research staff . The baseline intervention survey take approximately 30 65 minute , depend arm participant randomize , collect 240 participant . At one , two three month , follow survey administer collect data health care service utilize , health care cost incur , discussion ACP GC health care provider , lawyer , financial advisor and/or clergy precede month . The one two month survey approximately 10-20 minute length . Three-month follow-up survey collect data ACP , GC preferences GCD approximately 20-40 minute length . Researchers also collect data participant ' electronic medical health record diagnosis co-morbidities , health service utilization cost 12 month prior baseline , baseline approximately 12 month baseline . Objectives : 1 . Determine effectiveness Videos compare change baseline 1 , 2 3 month number participant conversation health care provider ACP GCD two group , namely : receive intervention ( usual care ) watch Videos . 2 . Determine cost economic consequence Videos compare change 12 month prior baseline include baseline , 1 month , 2 , month , 3 month 12 month follow baseline health care utilization cost two group describe Objective 1 .</detailed_description>
