	<brief_summary>Approximately 10 % world 's population particular genetic makeup ( know TT genotype ) may increase risk high blood pressure . Previous work conduct investigator research group University Ulster , collaboration clinical colleague across Northern Ireland , premature CVD patient hypertensive adult generally demonstrate dietary level riboflavin ( 1.6mg/d ) decrease blood pressure , specifically TT genotype . To date , blood pressure lower effect higher dos riboflavin individual TT genotype know . The aim study investigate whether supplementation riboflavin low dose supplemental level ( 10mg/d ) decrease blood pressure effectively dietary level ( 1.6mg/d ) optimise riboflavin status normalise MTHFR activity . This aim achieve conduct double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study 16 week period . Participants recruit cohort screen methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) C677T polymorphism . Those identified TT genotype ( homozygous polymorphism ) wish participate research ask attend baseline week-16 appointment ask take daily riboflavin ( 1.6 10mg/d ) placebo capsule duration study . At appointment blood sample take blood pressure , height , weight waist circumference measure . If result study show intervention high dose riboflavin low blood pressure effectively individual TT genotype important implication responsible management blood pressure . The finding particular relevance population high prevalence polymorphism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment - Potential participant identify recruited via GP practice , hospital outpatient clinic , pharmacy workplace throughout Northern Ireland . A letter invitation study package contain participant information sheet explain study , consent form buccal swab DNA collection kit include . Inclusion / Exclusion The main inclusion criterion individual must TT genotype . Exclusion criterion include history gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal haematological disorder , B-vitamin supplement consumer ( include multi-vitamins contain B-vitamins ) , anticonvulsant therapy drug know interfere folate/B-vitamin metabolism . Suitable individual participate screen process contact invited participate intervention study . Participants give least forty eight hour consider write information decide wish participate . Study Design Participants TT genotype give informed consent stratify blood pressure subsequently randomise receive placebo , low dose ( 1.6mg/d ) low supplemental dose ( 10mg/d ) riboflavin 16 week intervention period . It important aware upper limit establish water-soluble B-vitamin safety concern regard dos riboflavin indeed high dos ( include 25mg/d ) administer previous study ( Madigan et al . 1998 ) . Participants , depend geographical location , ask attend two appointment ( Baseline week 16 ) participant local GP Practice , The Clinical Translational Research Innovation Centre ( CTRIC ) Altnagelvin Area Hospital , The Welcome Trust-Wolfson Northern Ireland Clinical Research Facility ( NICRF ) Belfast City Hospital , Northern Ireland Centre Food &amp; Health ( NICHE ) ( University Ulster , Coleraine ) another convenient location . At sample point blood pressure ( SBP/DBP mmHg ) measure , 30ml blood sample take trained phlebotomist patient 's height ( ) , weight ( kg ) , waist circumference ( cm ) BMI ( kg/m2 ) measure . A detailed health lifestyle questionnaire collect information medical family history , medication supplement use dietary intake . Statistical analysis Statisticalanalysis perform use SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Sciences , Version 17.0Í¾ SPSS UK Ltd , Chersey , United Kingdom ) . Data normally distribute transformed obtain normality statistical analysis perform . Data analyse investigate difference exist BP response two riboflavin treatment group .</detailed_description>
