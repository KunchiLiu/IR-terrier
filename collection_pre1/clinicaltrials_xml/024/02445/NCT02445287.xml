	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate 2D 3D imaging performance CARESTREAM Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) scanner ( `` investigational device '' ) commercially available 2D 3D predicate device . The study undertaken demonstrate safety effectiveness investigational CARESTREAM Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) 2D image functionality compare predicate CARESTREAM DRX-1 GOS detector use adult cadaver specimens capture image pair . The study demonstrate safety effectiveness investigational CARESTREAM Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) 3D image functionality compare reference PHILLIPS Multi Detector Computed Tomography ( MDCT ) scanner use adult cadaver specimen ( body part ) capture 3D volumetric exam use anatomy upper low extremity specimen . The adult cadaver specimen receive multiple x-ray exposure use predicate device 2D 3D imaging . Target image cadaver specimen review radiologist reader rate diagnostic image quality , data include comparative evaluation . The live human subject portion study perform healthy volunteer . Each volunteer sign Informed Consent receive one 3D volumetric exam use investigational CARESTREAM Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) scanner . Target image review radiologist reader rate diagnostic image quality accord radiologist reader scale applicable 3D volumetric imaging .</detailed_description>
