	<brief_title>Genetics Arteriovenous Malformations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include AVM patient member nuclear family . All patient donate sample saliva ( 5 mL ) blood ( 10 mL ) . Basic demographic clinical parameter collect , include ethnicity , age first presentation , symptoms presentation , history subsequent symptom , treatment history , Spetzler-Martin AVM grade , medication history , pertinent medical information . In patient undergo AVM resection , small sample AVM collect concurrent genomic analysis . Family member donate saliva ( 5mL ) document relationship patient ( i.e. , parent , sibling , child , etcl ) . Nucleic acid isolate saliva/blood sample , genetic sequencing carry . When surgical sample AVM available , nucleic acid obtain transcriptome profiling perform . Identification genetic alteration common patient AVM present sample parent sibling greatly aid identification pathway associate AVM formation . Candidate sequence choose differential expression ( p &lt; 0.05 ) fold-changes . Once identify , mechanism rapid detection marker sequence develop predictive value test future collection .</detailed_description>
