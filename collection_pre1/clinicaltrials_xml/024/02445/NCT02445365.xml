	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic relapse inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . At time diagnosis possible predict course disease , range flare lifetime uncontrollable disease lead hospitalization , surgery stoma . There continuous need improve treatment well diagnostic prognostic tool . This study evaluate clinical efficacy , tolerability feasibility remote ischemic conditioning ( RIC ) patient moderate active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . The investigator hypothesize RIC beyond well know effect reperfusion tissue damage clinically relevant anti-inflammatory effect UC . RIC constitute repeat brief non-harmful suppression blood circulation limb . The mechanism action RIC likely involve suppress inflammation cell death . Our study randomize clinical controlled study include 38 patient . Patients receive RIC sham 10 consecutive day . The effect RIC active UC evaluate change patient 's symptom , endoscopy finding , various marker blood , faeces intestinal wall .</brief_summary>
