	<brief_summary>In recent year , advance high-throughput technique , microarrays next gen sequencing ( NGS ) technology , allow precise classification breast cancer molecular subtypes personalize approach anti-cancer therapy . To date , conventional method select patient clinical trial anti-targeted agent accord molecular criterion generally limit analysis biomarkers . Recent study show strategy inappropriate case infrequent molecular alteration ideal strategy would consist simultaneous examination large number actionable genomic alteration . This first genomic screening platform ever attempt Spain . By molecular platform SOLTI aim increase likelihood patient include trial design specifically molecular tumor type . Thus , primary objective pilot study determine Platform 's effectiveness include patient clinical trial target agent base tumor molecular profiling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SOLTI Breast Cancer Molecular Screening Program ( AGATA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , pilot study conduct eight site locate Spain . Up 260 female male patient , 18-70 year advance metastatic breast cancer screen . These patient receive , receive , receive treatment disease either clinical trial healthcare set . Quality life score accord ECOG scale ≤ 2 minimal life expectancy 3 month . Upon sign inform consent confirmation eligibility criterion , tumor sample obtain patient either biopsy metastatic cancer archive tissue previously available site , genomic profile analyze . It assess mutational status panel gene consider relevant tumor biology treatment . Detected variant /mutations sample classify accord origin somatic germline , since normal pair DNA analyze . Should clinical trial match patient 's molecular profile , she/he offer participate available sample leave sequence supplied central confirmation would request . The patient 's clinical data collect quarterly basis death consent withdrawal . Mutation test carry three laboratory experience high-throughput sequence technique : VHIO Cancer Genomics Core laboratory Barcelona , Genomics Laboratory Research Institute Doce de Octubre University Hospital Madrid Genomics laboratory University Clinical Hospital Valencia . There need join effort , set standard optimize procedure benefit patient , opportunity participate genomic screen program offer great majority hospital lack technology require test .</detailed_description>
