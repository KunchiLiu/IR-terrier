	<brief_title>Impact Timing Wound Dressing Removal After Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immediate wound coverage one cornerstones post-operative wound management . Dressings typically leave place 24 48 hour follow cesarean section allow ample time heal re-epithelialization . The function surgical dress wound heal primary intention control postoperative bleeding , absorb exudate , ease pain , provide protection newly-formed epithelium . The skin important anatomical barrier microbe ; reformation intact epithelial system follow injury important milestone prevention infection . Wound heal dynamic process involve coordinate interaction variety cell , include cytokine , blood cell , extracellular matrix protein , parenchyma cell . Wound heal artificially divide three phase : inflammation , tissue formation ( proliferation ) , tissue remodel . These phase correspond precise period time follow injury , phase overlap degree . Re-epithelialization occur proliferation phase define process restore intact epidermis injury . It involve several process , include migration proliferation adjacent epidermal keratinocytes wound , differentiation neo-epithelium stratify epidermis , restoration intact basement membrane zone ( BMZ ) connect epidermis underlying dermis . Re-epithelialization wound begin within hour injury . Within 24 hour , keratinocytes actively proliferate margin wound cover defect . Surgical wound close primary intention usually heal rapidly , re-epithelialization thought occur within 24 48 hour . Early study wound care demonstrate dressing influence repair process . The post-operative wound dress act ensure wound bed stay moist , decrease pain inflammation , improve scar appearance . Additionally , occlusive dressing increase rate re-epithelialization post-operatively compare wound leave open . The importance dressing establish , ideal time postoperative dressing remain place remain elusive . Studies show early removal dressing ( 6 hour wound ) markedly decrease rate resurfacing , leave bandage great 48 hour produce great benefit . The United States Centers Disease Control Prevention recommend sterile dress stay place 24-48 hour post-operatively incision close primary intention . Although window benefit provide bandage refine since early study . By define period dressing promote epithelial resurfacing , ability use dress optimally enhance . Our goal study investigate difference outcome dressing leave place 24 hour versus 48 hour . While epithelial proliferation begin within hour closure , maximum 48 72 hour follow injury . Current standard care keep dress place 24 48 hour post-operatively . However , data compare optimum time 24 48 hour . We therefore assess benefit leave dress place 24 v 48 hour post-operatively evaluate impact wind appearance incidence surgical site infection use ASEPSIS score method . The ASEPSIS quantitative score method provide numerical score related severity wound infection use objective criterion base wound appearance clinical consequence infection . Severity impair wound heal indicated total score follow : satisfactory heal 0 10 ; disturbance heal 11 20 ; minor wound infection 21 30 ; moderate wound infection 31 40 ; severe wound infection 40 .</detailed_description>
