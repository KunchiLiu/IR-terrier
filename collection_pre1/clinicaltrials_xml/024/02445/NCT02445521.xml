	<brief_title>Testing Four Home Phenylalanine Monitoring Prototype Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A real time , point-of-care home phenylalanine monitoring system would provide patient quick result feedback . Home monitoring device ' phenylalanine measurement compare current gold-standard measurement phenylalanine ( plasma concentration ) four subject PKU one control subject . The study enroll subject different baseline phenylalanine concentration ( i.e. , patient poor good metabolic control , assess compare current phenylalanine concentration establish treatment range ) . For prototype device , three separate measurement phenylalanine per subject perform . Three prototype device require whole blood , thus 1 teaspoon ( approximately 4mL ) whole blood collect venipuncture blood spot use conduct test . One prototype require capillary blood collect fingerstick , require three blood spot stick . A single plasma amino acid analysis participant also perform use leftover whole blood 4mL blood draw quantitative ion exchange chromatography , report micromoles/L .</detailed_description>
