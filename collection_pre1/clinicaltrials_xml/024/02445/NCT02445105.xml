	<detailed_description>The American Academy Pediatrics recommend screen child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) 18 24 month research indicate early intervention maximize child 's outcome . The early sign ASD delay social communication milestone appear first 2 year yet child diagnose 4-5 year age . Underserved family identify even later significantly underrepresented intervention research . It vitally important mobilize community service system impact family engagement throughout process screening , evaluation , early intervention ( EI ) support linkages public community-based EI order address health disparity . This collaborative investigation 4 university aim document effectiveness online automate universal screen communication delay autism initially 18 month age decision rule referral ASD evaluation , study evidence-based intervention increase family engagement expedite receipt screening , diagnosis , eligibility EI , EI service . The study focus young age ASD detect reliably , 18 month , compare effectiveness screen referral 3 different community service system : 1 ) primary care include private public health care agency federally qualify health center ; 2 ) federal program Women , Infants , Children ( WIC ) Food Nutrition Service Early Head Start ; 3 ) National Black Church Initiative ( NBCI ) . Using Autism Navigator web-based platform investigator expand capacity universal ASD screen referral diagnosis determine eligibility EI provider public Individuals Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) Part C system child birth 3 year age . Innovative web-based technology integrate multiple levelsâ€” basis interactive professional development course enable community service system efficiently learn autism implement universal broadband autism-specific screening seamless automation link electronic health record provide family web-based tool autism . This multidisciplinary research team conduct multisite pragmatic randomize clinical trial test effectiveness evidence-based Family Engagement Intervention plus Autism Navigator compare Autism Navigator Enhanced Practice alone . The investigator also conduct exploratory study test strategy improve uptake evidence-based intervention community-based EI provider Part C system . This protocol potential low age screen ASD 18 month , important implication earlier access intervention improve ASD service system ready immediate rapid implementation community setting across US . Findings advance science provide researcher method recruit population-based sample , allow research young age , could accelerate genetic , neuroscience , intervention research , lead transformative change community healthcare delivery .</detailed_description>
