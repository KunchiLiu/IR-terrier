	<brief_title>Feasibility Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One issue manage rectal cancer identify patient benefit less radical surgery , much safe well tolerate . However remove lymph node cancer cell may spread . If lymph node contain cancer leave behind , cancer may recur . So surgery suitable early rectal cancer involve lymph node . Unfortunately , current investigation always accurately identify involved lymph node . Sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) technique surgically remove first lymph node cancer cell spread . If lymph node contains cancer , radical surgery need reduce risk recurrence . However clear , less radical surgery sufficient . This standard practice breast cancer avoids unnecessary major surgery many patient . The investigator aim ass whether SLNB useful rectal cancer . The investigator determine whether Sienna+/Sentimag system effectively identify sentinel lymph node , whether node remove surgically . The investigator recruit patient Oxford hospital undergo surgery rectal cancer . Patients receive injection magnetic tracer endoscopy prior surgery . Some patient extra MRI scan . During surgery , depend type operation plan , magnetic probe use locate sentinel lymph node tissue around rectum . The removed specimen examine pathologist . Funding undertake study grant National Institute Health Research ( NIHR ) . Endomagnetics , manufacturer , supply magnetic tracer probe use study . If successful , investigator plan large clinical trial . This could major impact improve outcome patient allow less radical surgery use appropriate .</detailed_description>
