	<detailed_description>Recent large randomize multicenter trial investigate effect lower blood glucose level towards normal inpatient ambulatory care/community setting . All study report increase prevalence incidence hypoglycemia glucose level approach normal . In fact , occurrence hypoglycemia problematic hospital base study halt target recommendation glucose level critically unwell patient increase . Similarly three recent large glucose control complication trial type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) report significantly high rate hypoglycemia intensively treat type 2 DM individual . In two study ( VADT , ADVANCE ) highly significant association severe hypoglycemia ( glucose low enough cause neurologic impairment ) serious cardiac event increase death . Furthermore , two study perform USA ( VADT , ACCORD ) , severe hypoglycemia occur standard/conventionally treat group produce even serious adverse cardiac effect compare intensively treat group . The in-vivo mechanism ( ) responsible finding could identify study . Surprisingly limited data available regard effect hypoglycemia in-vivo vascular biology . Previously , vitro work determine epinephrine , norepinephrine , growth hormone , glucagon , corticosteroid ( counterregulatory hormone ) vascular biologic effect ( platelet aggregation , fibrinolytic balance , increase pro-inflammatory marker change endothelial function ) . Three recent study laboratory perform healthy volunteer type 1 DM demonstrate hypoglycemia produce spectrum pro-inflammatory pro-atherothrombotic change . Novel preliminary data lab also demonstrate hypoglycemia impair endothelial function , reduce fibrinolytic balance ( increase plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ) produce pro-atherothrombotic ( increase platelet aggregation , thrombin anti-thrombin complex , vascular adhesion molecule ) change type 2 DM . Additionally , preliminary data present demonstrate 90 minute episode hypoglycemia ( 50 mg/dl ) produce similar pro-atherothrombotic change compare 4 hour hyperglycemia ( 200 mg/dl ) . However , investigator begin realize effect hypoglycemia vascular biology , remain many unanswered question . For example , vulnerable type 2 DM population dose response different level hypoglycemia attendant ANS activation endothelial function atherothrombotic balance ? How level glycemic control affect ANS vascular biologic response hypoglycemia type 2 DM ? Proposed study protocol provide novel information answer clinically important question regard effect mild moderate hypoglycemia vascular biologic mechanism healthy population .</detailed_description>
