	<brief_title>Reliability 4 Metre Gait Speed Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study investigate simple test walk speed , measure use 4 metre gait speed test ( 4MGS ) , patient lung disease call Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) . Drug development disease slow part lack reliable measurement assess effectiveness treatment . Slow walk speed show relate poor outcome older adult people another lung disease call Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD . The investigator interested see whether usual walk speed reliable measure patient IPF help inform u potential use outcome measure . To , participant consent take part study time walk usual walk speed distance 4 metre ( 13.12 foot ) . Participants ask twice rest require . One week later , participant ask repeat walking test .</detailed_description>
