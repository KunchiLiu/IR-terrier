	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize wash insemination catheter prior perform IUI ( intrauterine insemination ) improve pregnancy outcome IUI cycle compare control ( without pre-washing catheter ) . Catheter wash perform routinely embryo transfer , however do IUI catheter . Therefore data available apply technique IUI catheter prior insemination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Pre-washing Insemination Catheter Pregnancy Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : To determine pre-washing catheter insemination improve pregnancy outcome woman undergo IUI . Secondary objective : 1 . To evaluate impact pre-washing catheter insemination ectopic pregnancy rate woman undergo IUI . 2 . To evaluate impact pre-washing catheter insemination miscarriage rate woman undergo IUI . 3 . To evaluate impact pre-washing catheter insemination multiple pregnancy rate woman undergo IUI . STUDY DESIGN : The study prospective double blind trial among woman undergo IUI MUHC reproductive centre use cluster randomize design . The week define unit cluster randomization . Weeks allocate one follow group : - Group 1 = pre-washing group ( patient IUI pre-washed catheter week ) - Group 2 = control group ( pre-washing IUI week ) A random block size use minimize risk non-blinding . The study double-blind , neither patient physicians perform IUI know whether catheter wash , sample catheter prepare andrology lab technician . The cluster randomization design justify since management unit allow u perform randomization patient level . However low Intra-Correlation Coefficient ( ICC ) patient expect .</detailed_description>
