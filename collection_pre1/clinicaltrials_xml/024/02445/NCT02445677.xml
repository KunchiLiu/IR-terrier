	<brief_summary>Introduction : Chronic pain affect half elderly individual . Past study show pain interfere motor learn rehabilitation . It suggest relieve pain physical therapy session might interest strategy potentiate rehabilitation old patient suffer pain . Objective : This study aim determine analgesic effect induce TENS use maximize rehabilitation elderly patient suffer chronic pain . More specifically , objective : 1 ) compare functional outcome patient Day Hospital receive rehabilitation either active TENS treatment simulate TENS treatment , 2 ) determine association analgesic effect TENS clinical evolution patient follow rehabilitation . Methods : In RCT , patient assign randomly either : 1 ) experimental group receive active TENS treatment 2 ) control group receive simulate TENS treatment . Thirty-six patient recruit accord follow criterion : 1 ) receive physiotherapy rehabilitation Day Hospital CSSS-IUGS , 2 ) least 65 year age , 3 ) suffer chronic pain ( pain last 6 month ) , 4 ) present pain rehabilitation Day hospital . For security reason , patient cardiac simulator exclude present study ( TENS contraindication ) . Patients cognitive alteration ( score &lt; 24/30 Folstein test ) also exclude . Sociodemographic information retrieve medical record research assistant baseline ( T1 ) . Moreover , various questionnaire administer T1 , half rehabilitation period ( i.e . 4 6 week ) ( T2 ) , 8- 12- week rehabilitation period ( T3 ) measure qualitative aspect pain , mood , physical function . Functional outcomes well collect directly medical record assessment time ( T1 , T2 T3 ) .The measure include exercise tolerance , balance , mobility balance , functional ability . Anticipated result : We believe : 1 ) use active TENS rehabilitation session potentiate rehabilitation patient suffer chronic pain CSSS-IUGS Day Hospital , 2 ) relationship analgesic effect induce TENS clinical evolution patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Chronic pain affect half elderly individual . Past study show pain interfere motor learn rehabilitation . This phenomenon , potentially attributable deleterious effect nociceptive input motor system , suggest relieve pain physical therapy session might interest strategy potentiate rehabilitation old patient suffer pain . Objective The objective study determine analgesic effect induce transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) use maximize rehabilitation elderly patient suffer chronic pain . More specifically , study aim : 1 ) compare functional outcome patient Day Hospital receive rehabilitation active TENS treatment patient receive rehabilitation simulate TENS treatment , 2 ) determine association analgesic effect TENS clinical evolution patient follow rehabilitation . Methods This study randomize clinical trial two parallel arm . Patients assign randomly either : 1 ) experimental group receive active TENS treatment 2 ) control group receive simulate TENS treatment ( double blind study ) . Thirty-six patient recruit accord follow criterion : 1 ) receive physiotherapy rehabilitation Day Hospital Pavillon d'Youville CSSS-IUGS , 2 ) least 65 year age , 3 ) suffer chronic pain ( pain last 6 month ) , 4 ) present pain rehabilitation Day hospital . For security reason , patient cardiac simulator exclude present study ( TENS contraindication ) . Patients cognitive alteration ( score &lt; 24/30 Folstein test ) also exclude . In order good characterisation sample , information retrieve medical record research assistant , include : 1 ) age , gender , pain localisation , medical diagnosis medication . Moreover , various questionnaire administer baseline ( T1 ) , half rehabilitation period ( i.e . 4 6 week ) ( T2 ) , 8- 12- week rehabilitation period ( T3 ) measure : 1 ) qualitative aspect pain ( McGill-Melzack pain questionnaire ) , 2 ) mood ( Beck Depression Inventory ) , 3 ) physical function ( Brief Pain Inventory ) . Functional outcome also collect directly medical record baseline assessment time ( T1 , T2 , T3 ) . The measure include : 1 ) exercise tolerance ( 6-minute walk test [ 6MWT ] ) , 2 ) balance ( Berg Balance Scale [ BBS ] ) , 3 ) mobility balance ( Time go [ TUG ] ) , 4 ) functional ability ( Functional autonomy measurement system [ SMAF ] ) . Anticipated result We believe : 1 ) use active TENS rehabilitation session potentiate rehabilitation patient suffer chronic pain CSSS-IUGS Day Hospital , 2 ) relationship analgesic effect induce TENS clinical evolution patient .</detailed_description>
