	<brief_title>Diclofenac Premedication , Effect Preemptive Analgesia After Post-thoracotomy Chest Shoulder Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Thoracotomies think one difficult surgical incision deal post-operatively , extremely painful pain prevent patient breathe effectively . Currently institute surgical post-operative anelgesia manage combination local anesthetic opioid pain killer epidural cannula . In addition investigator give diclofenac intravenously ( 2nd day operation per o ) well nalbuphin give intravenously patient necesserary . By definition pre-emptive analgesia mean treatment pain initiated surgical procedure analgetics nerve blockade technique . The purpose method inhibit production inflammatory mediator prevention pain stimulus enter central nervous system . As result pre-emptive antinociceptive treatment , quantity post-operative medication decrease , analgesia less complication patient satisfied . In study researcher would like examine pre-emptive analgetic effect diclofenac . Patients method : Patients undergo thoracotomy divide two group . : - Study Group : 100mg diclofenac per o ( n=50 ) - Control Group : patient get diclofenac premedication ( n=50 ) The investigator examine every patient five day : record patient ' pain help Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . We measure analgetic consumption intramuscular morphin equivalent dose local anesthetic consumption via epidural cannula seperately . The lung function test carry two time postoperatively help MIR Spirolab II mobil spirometer .</detailed_description>
