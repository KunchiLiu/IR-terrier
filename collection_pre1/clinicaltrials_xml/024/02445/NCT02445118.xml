	<detailed_description>This pilot study focus three primary objective : evaluate volume retention site inject allograft adipose matrix ( AAM ) , obtain tissue analysis via magnetic resonance image site injection evaluate local skin change result injection AAM follow 16 week period . The AAM derive cadaveric human adipose recover , process , dehydrate distribute study sponsor thoroughly screen donor . It distribute instruction rehydration prior single use . The injection site ( non-dominant wrist ) infiltrate Lidocaine 0.5 % , Epinepherine 1:200,000 prior AAM injection . Volume AAM necessary create center 2-3mm raise wheal first proximal dorsal wrist crease administer . Photographs take prior follow injection subsequent visit take color standard within frame later color change analysis injection surround area . Both control treat hand/wrist photograph separately numerous position ( extension , flexion several degree either ) heart level , week 0,2,10 16 week . A clinical assessment scale evaluation skin change appearance also do time . Patients advise avoid prolonged pressure dorsal wrist , wear jewelry wrist band , etc. , duration participation study . Those patient designate MR image shall MRIs do within 3 5 day week zero week16 visit . The image shall read document single independent radiologist .</detailed_description>
