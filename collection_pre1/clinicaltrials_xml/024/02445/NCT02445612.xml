	<brief_title>Long Term Follow Up Sub-retinal Transplantation hESC Derived RPE Cells Stargardt Macular Dystrophy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study long term , non interventional follow phase I/II , open-label , non randomize , sequential , multi-center trial ( refer core protocol ) maximum 13 SMD patient treat . Ten poor vision subject ( 20/400 ) transplant sequential dos hESC-RPE cell , start dose 50,000 hESC-RPE cell transplant ( three subject ) , 100,000 hESC-RPE cell transplant ( three subject ) , 150,000 hESC-RPE cell transplant ( three subject ) increase maximum dose 200,000 hESC-RPE cell transplant ( one subject ) . Three good vision subject ( 20/100 ) transplant dose 100,000 hESC-RPE cell . Eligible patient sign consent form extension study , fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion . The first visit extension protocol correspond last visit core protocol , take place 12 month post cell implantation . During first 2 year completion core protocol , i.e . Year 1 Year 2 Year 2 Year 3 post transplantation , patient evaluate approximately 3 month interval ; year three thru five patient evaluate approximately six month interval . During year 6-15 , patient either required return study center provide name ophthalmologist locality would provide evaluation patient 's vision abnormal finding report result study site annually . Follow include obtain information visual acuity , ophthalmological finding adverse event ( AEs ) , specifically include cancer , neurological , autoimmune hematological disorder develop worsen since last visit .</detailed_description>
