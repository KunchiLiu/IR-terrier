	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well cisplatin carboplatin ( platinum base chemotherapy ) work compare capecitabine treat patient remain ( residual ) basal-like triple-negative breast cancer follow chemotherapy surgery ( neoadjuvant ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , carboplatin capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether cisplatin carboplatin effective capecitabine treat patient residual triple negative basal-like breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platinum Based Chemotherapy Capecitabine Treating Patients With Residual Triple-Negative Basal-Like Breast Cancer Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare invasive disease-free survival ( IDFS ) triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) patient residual basal-like disease neoadjuvant chemotherapy randomize post-preoperative platinum base chemotherapy randomize capecitabine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) response-free survival ( RFS ) two arm patient TNBC residual basal-like disease neoadjuvant chemotherapy . II . To characterize side effect tolerability platinum agent ( cisplatin carboplatin ) well capecitabine patient TNBC residual disease neoadjuvant chemotherapy . III . To identify rate basal-like gene expression use prediction analysis microarray 50 ( PAM50 ) analysis digital messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) quantitation amongst drug-resistant residual TNBC neoadjuvant chemotherapy . IV . To compare IDFS TNBC patient residual non-basal-like disease neoadjuvant chemotherapy randomize post-preoperative platinum base chemotherapy randomize capecitabine ( exploratory analysis ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM A ( closed accrual 05/16/2016 ) : Patients undergo observation . ARM B : Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) carboplatin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM C : Patients receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 10 year .</detailed_description>
