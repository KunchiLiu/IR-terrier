	<brief_summary>Our primary aim ass feasibility initiate treatment ED extended-release naltrexone ( XR-NTX ) plus care management ( CM ) vs. standard care continue care cooperation clinic provider well best assess outcome . Secondarily , investigator explore effect various health outcome ( healthcare utilization engagement , expenditures , drink consequence , quality life ) well association patient-level characteristic ( e.g . sex , race , baseline drinking , health psychosocial factor , mu opioid receptor genotype ) effectiveness . Determining implement XR-NTX+CM rigorously test effect ED ( phase 1 ) essential plan large-scale effectiveness trial ( phase 2 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim # 1 : To conduct feasibility acceptability study XR-NTX+CM treatment alcohol dependent patient frequent ED use . Hypothesis : Enrollment limit number subject allow identification optimal process definitive trial . Aim # 2 : To conduct analysis effect intervention healthcare utilization engagement , drink outcome , quality life , consequence drinking ( initial analysis exploratory ) . Hypothesis : Measuring change healthcare utilization , drink metric , indicator quality life consequence provide preliminary data intervention effect size various outcome interest inform second phase , definitive trial . Aim # 3 : To identify patient-level characteristic associated effectiveness . Hypothesis : Exploratory analysis patient system-level characteristic possibly associate effectiveness inform treatment choice maximize probability successful outcome . Factors assess include data collect ongoing investigation pharmacotherapy alcohol dependence , include mu opioid receptor ( OPRM1 ) genotype , facilitate comparison across study population setting . This phase IV , randomize , open-label , non-placebo-controlled , single-center study feasibility , acceptability , effect initiate treatment ED extended-release naltrexone 380mg intramuscular injection compare standard care subject severe alcohol use disorder ( i.e . alcohol dependence ) frequent emergency department use . In first two year , finalize study preparation , recruit randomize 50 subject pilot phase study . The duration subject 's participation 12 month . Thereafter , second phase study , enroll additional 250 subject ( total 300 subject ) address remain feasibility acceptability concern test effect . The study investigator ( PI RA ) collect process data , include barrier facilitator encounter completion study procedure . For follow study procedure , study investigator ( PI RAs ) enter data directly New York University Langone Medical Center ( NYULMC ) internal REDCap system use portable tablet computer . Synopsis Study Procedures : The follow study procedure describe great detail elsewhere protocol . Patients prescreened potential eligibility add automate alert system link ED registration Bellevue Care Managers part ongoing quality improvement initiative . When potentially eligible patient present ED , automate page deliver study PI Bellevue ED social work care management staff , prompt consultation potential referral patient study investigator ( PI/RA ) recruitment ( See 4.3 Subject Recruitment Screening ) . ED medical provider ( inclusive ED physician , nurse , social worker , care manager ) notify study investigator ( PI/RA ) potentially eligible patient present ED . The medical provider introduce PI/RA clinically sober medically stable patient give permission approach . The PI/RA describe study , confirm capacity consent use University California San Diego Brief Assessment Capacity Consent Research ( UBACC ) , obtain write informed consent . The PI/RA confirm eligibility perform chart laboratory review ( liver enzymes , pregnancy , urine drug screen ) , history examination , diagnostic interview confirm alcohol dependence ass opioid use chronic pain . The PI/RA conduct research intake assessment interview collect blood biomarker ( 5mL ) genetic ( 10mL ) analysis . The PI/RA randomize subject intervention ( XR-NTX+CM ) Standard Care use random number generator randomly permute block allocation contain within opaque seal envelope . 1 . For subject randomize Intervention Arm , PI/RA confirm drug screen negative opioids prior administer XR-NTX 380mg intramuscular gluteal injection . The PI/RA facilitate person-centered , harm-reduction-based motivational interview , , psychosocial assessment/interview inform subject ' care-management plan . Subjects receive one-week referral Bellevue ambulatory care initial Alcohol-Medical Management ( MM ) also schedule every 4 week ( recent XR-NTX injection ) MM XR-NTX injection . When possible , participant miss MM-injection visit navigate clinic upon next ED presentation and/or may receive MM XR-NTX ED . XR-NTX administer PI provider ( physician , physician assistant , register nurse ) train administration XR-NTX . The schedule MM-Injection visit week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 . Participants may offer continue XR-NTX treatment study many 12 injection total explore feasibility , acceptability potential benefit extend treatment duration 12 month . The schedule potential additional MM-Injection visit week 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 . Research assessment visit occur week 12 , 24 , 48 may conduct 28 day prior to- 90 day after- date research visit due . During research visit , PI/RA repeat assessment conduct initial enrollment visit plus adverse event participant satisfaction collect 5mL blood sample examine alcohol consumption biomarkers . Subject participation end week-48 research visit . 2 . For subject randomize Standard care arm , PI/RA provide referral Bellevue ambulatory care MM without intervention . Research assessment visit occur week 12 , 24 , 48 may conduct 28 day prior to- 90 day after- date research visit due . During research visit , PI/RA repeat assessment conduct initial enrollment visit plus adverse event participant satisfaction collect 5mL blood sample examine alcohol consumption biomarkers . Subject participation end week-48 research visit .</detailed_description>
