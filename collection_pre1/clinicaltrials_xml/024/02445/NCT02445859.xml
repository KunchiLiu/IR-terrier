	<brief_summary>We propose randomise patient due undergo colorectal surgery standard antibiotic prophylaxis interventional antibiotic prophylaxis regimen assess surgical wound infection rate . Standard antibiotic prophylaxis pre-operative injection cefuroxime , repeat every 4 hour . The intervention regimen load dose cefuroxime follow continuous infusion cefuroxime end surgery . The intervention regimen dose calculate use patient 's renal function body weight . The intervention regimen target free serum drug concentration 64mg/L . This serum level 4x MIC90 colonise Enterobacteriaceae . The rational dosing regimen summarise . The primary objective study reduce 50 % rate surgical wound infection colorectal surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An expert assessment fT &gt; MIC measure likely applicable prophylaxis . But measure achieve standard prophylaxis regimen . Neither clinical data suggest target achieves optimal prophylaxis . Therefore opportunity optimise antibiotic prophylaxis dose . As exposure response-relationship ( pharmacodynamic target ) unknown could either complete number study explore different relationship , compare standard treatment single regimen include number exposure-response relationship . The two common exposure-response relationship CMAX/MIC ratio fT &gt; MIC . And report killing , oppose inhibition use MIC value , optimise achieve 4 time MIC value . An antibiotic prophylaxis regimen achieve drug concentration 4xMIC duration surgery would therefore achieves high CMAX/MIC ratio , high T &gt; MIC , optimise bacterial killing . Therefore , standard dose antibiotic prophylaxis compare PD target dose antibiotic prophylaxis regimen . The PD target free serum antibiotic concentration 4xMIC90 Enterobacteriaceae cefuroxime . Continuous infusion antibiotic prophylaxis ensure continuous target drug level throughout operation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Undergoing colorectal surgery ( incision , excision anastomosis large bowel , include anastomosis small large bowel ) Age &gt; 18 . Expected duration surgery &gt; 2hours Creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min Cefuroxime/metronidazole appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis regimen . Patient capable give informed consent Patients undergoing colorectal surgery plus additional surgery e.g . plastic surgery , urological surgery , gynaecological surgery . If possible obtain intraoperative blood sample e.g . difficult vascular access , preoperative swab e.g . anatomy make difficult obtain , patient include information treat miss data . Patients antibiotic treatment exist infection ( except SSIs ) include study Unable consent Pregnancy Expected duration surgery &lt; 2hours Creatinine clearance &lt; 40ml/min Individual level microbiological advice non cefuroxime base prophylaxis Cephalosporin allergy Penicillin allergy ( hypersensitivity reaction ) Coumarin ( warfarin acenocoumarol ) treatment Active blood borne virus infection e.g . HIV , hepatitis . Seizure history Concurrent use probenecid Current participation research project aim reduce SSIs Antibiotics treatment systemic Gram negative infection within 2 hour initiation surgery ( Vancomycin , Teicoplanin , Daptomycin , Linezolid , Flucloxacillin . Nitrofurantoin Clarithromycin would permissible antibiotic without systemic Gram negative antibiotic ) . A current diagnosis SSI time study entry .</criteria>
