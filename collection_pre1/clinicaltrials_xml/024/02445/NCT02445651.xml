	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) neurodegenerative disorder unknown cause affect million Americans . It 's prominent pathology degeneration dopaminergic neuron brain . It believe oxidative stress inflammation play important role pathophysiology Parkinson 's disease well . The object study evaluate whether nutritional supplementation compound show either anti- inflammatory , antioxidant effect , might support brain function patient Parkinson 's disease , particularly regard dopamine system . Enrolled patient randomly assign receive oral intravenous n-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) , standard PD care . This study utilize Ioflupane ( DaTscan ) single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) measure dopamine function , magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) measure inflammatory oxidative stress marker , neurological measure assess clinical symptom , patient PD . Subjects receive DaTSCAN MRS initially complete supplement NAC regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist two arm . The first arm study receive intravenous oral NAC , strong antioxidant increase brain glutathione , may beneficial PD . NAC , N-acetyl derivative naturally occur amino acid , L-cysteine . It common over-the-counter supplement also available injectable pharmaceutical protects liver case acetaminophen overdose . Laboratory study display benefit use NAC , potential counteract intracellular damage lead dopaminergic neuron death . It also potential reduce marker oxidative damage , protect dopamine cell death MPTP toxicity , increase glutathione blood , might useful prevent oxidative damage PD patients.The second arm waitlist control receive standard PD care . It note arm receive standard PD care augment NAC .</detailed_description>
