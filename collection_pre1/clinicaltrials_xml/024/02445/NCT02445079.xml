	<brief_title>Ugandan Non-Communicable Diseases Aging Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study recruit people live HIV/AIDS ( PLWH ) age 40 old ; HIV-uninfected age gender-matched , community-based comparison group HIV clinic catchment area . Study investigator collect sociodemographic , clinical , immune activation , systemic inflammation , plasma stool microbiome , clinical pulmonary cardiovascular disease measure . Our outcomes interest measure carotid atherosclerosis , include carotid intima medium thickness presence plaque , prior ischemic heart disease ( measured electrocardiogram ) , peripheral arterial disease ( measure ankle-branchial index ) , lung function measure pulmonary function test . Our exposure interest traditional cardiovascular disease risk factor ( e.g . age , gender , family history cardiovascular disease , smoke history , diet , activity , body mass index , prevalence diabetes , prevalence hypertension ) HIV-related cardiovascular risk factor ( e.g . nadir CD4 count , ART duration regimen , gut plasma microbiome composition , marker immune activation systemic inflammation ) . Investigators collect data accomplish follow aim : Aim 1 : Compare prevalence atherosclerosis , measure cIMT , ankle-brachial index , presence q-waves electrocardiogram , PLWH take ART age 40 old age gender-matched , population-based HIV-uninfected control . This study aim among first capture high-quality measure atherosclerotic disease among population PLWH sub-Saharan Africa . The study aim test hypothesis older-age Ugandans ART thicker carotid intima medium , high prevalence peripheral arterial disease , high prevalence pathologic q-waves electrocardiogram age gender-matched , HIV-uninfected control . Aim 2 : Evaluate correlate atherosclerosis older-age PLWH ART , include traditional ( age , gender , smoking , diabetes hypertension prevalence ) HIV-related risk factor ( immune activation , systemic inflammation , stool plasma microbiome composition ) . The study leverage collaboration Ragon Institute perform immunologic molecular test microbial translocation marker immune activation systemic inflammation ( e.g . soluble CD163 , C-reactive protein , IL-6 , CD8+ T-lymphocyte activation ) . Aim 3 : Compare progression atherosclerosis PLWH versus HIV-uninfected individual five year observation time . The study aim test hypothesis rate change carotid intima medium thickness faster among PLWH 45 ART age gender-matched HIV-uninfected control , rate change carotid intima medium thickness among HIV-infected cohort associate marker microbial translocation , immune activation , systemic inflammation . Aim 4 : Compare prevalence incidence abnormal pulmonary function ( FEV1 , FVC , FEV1/FVC ) PLWH ART age- gender-matched , population-based HIV-uninfected control , utilize handheld spirometry bronchodilator challenge . The study aim test hypothesis pulmonary function worse COPD common among people live HIV/AIDS age- gender-match HIV-uninfected control .</detailed_description>
