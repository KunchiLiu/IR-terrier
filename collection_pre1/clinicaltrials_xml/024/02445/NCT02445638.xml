	<brief_title>HDL Lipidomic , Proteomic Functional Changes Women After Eating Eggs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize 4 week daily consumption whole egg versus yolk-free egg result difference HDL composition profile lipid protein ( lipidome proteome ) , associate change HDL functionality . It hypothesize possible discriminate responder non-responders egg term increase apolipoprotein A-1 ( ApoA-I ) content plasma , correspond protective HDL particle ; increase HDL functionality ( cholesterol efflux anti-oxidant capacity ) . Subjects consume egg free diet study protocol , except egg meal provide study . The study comprise two 4-week feed period 4-week washout test period . While study , subject consume equivalent two egg breakfast , either whole egg yolk-free egg . Following 2-week low-egg lead-in period , subject randomly select start either arm cross arm 4-week washout period . Measured result compare baseline 4-week end point arm . Additional comparison may make 4-week endpoint .</detailed_description>
