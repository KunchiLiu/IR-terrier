	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Examine Effects Vitamin D Supplementation Mitochondrial Bioenergetics Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past two decade , role vitamin D extend beyond bone health encompass wide range biological activity important muscle function old adult . Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 [ OH ] D ) concentration ( &lt; 30 ng/mL ) associate low extremity muscle weakness , impaired physical performance , slow walk speed , ( 1-8 ) know risk factor disability . ( 9-15 ) Low 25 ( OH ) D concentration older adult also associate frailty well individual frailty component include muscle weakness , slow walk speed , exhaustion/fatigue . ( 16-18 ) Clinical finding vitamin D deficiency ( 25 ( OH ) D &lt; 12 ng/mL ) include proximal muscle weakness , muscle pain , gait impairment often reverse vitamin D supplementation . ( 19 ; 20 ) However , vitamin D 's effect mechanisms underlying muscle function well understood . Recent evidence support role vitamin D skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism . Using 31P-MRS imaging , increase maximal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) report follow vitamin D supplementation . ( 21 ) Thus , hypothesize muscle weakness slow walk speed individual low 25 ( OH ) D concentration may part due diminished OXPHOS activity lower ATP generation skeletal muscle mitochondrion . Vitamin D insufficiency common old adult , range approximately one-third three-fourths community-dwelling adult age ≥70 year depend cut-point use ( 25 ( OH ) D &lt; 20 ng/mL &lt; 30 ng/mL , respectively ) . ( 22 ; 23 ) Similarly , bioenergetic decline broadly associate increase age . ( 24 ) Thus , examine association vitamin D mitochondrial bioenergetics improve understand underlie mechanisms range potential benefit remediate low 25 ( OH ) D concentration old adult . The objective study obtain preliminary data effect increase 25 ( OH ) D concentration among old adult vitamin D insufficiency ≥30 ng/mL vitamin D3 supplementation 1 ) bioenergetic profile multiple blood cell population , skeletal muscle mitochondrion , muscle fiber 2 ) skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass biogenesis . Hypothesis 1 : Bioenergetic capacity well respiratory control muscle mitochondrion , muscle fiber , blood cell improve follow 4 month vitamin D3 supplementation . Hypothesis 2 : Expression key mitochondrial protein ( VDAC/Porin COX4 ) regulator mitochondria biogenesis ( PGC1a , SIRT1 , SIRT3 , TFAM ) high follow 4 month vitamin D3 supplementation . We plan recruit individual screen fail EVIDENCE study ( IRB00022395 ) . The EVIDENCE study enrol 200 participant whose 25 ( OH ) D concentration 18- &lt; 30 ng/mL . Those whose concentration 12- &lt; 18 ng/mL EVIDENCE screen visit approach participate pilot study . We utilize EVIDENCE screen fails pilot study limit funding , screen lab ( 25 ( OH ) D ) expensive number need screen would cost-prohibitive pilot study , two study run clinic staff . All screening measure occur EVIDENCE study measure begin study baseline visit . All person screen fail EVIDENCE 25 ( OH ) D concentration 12- &lt; 18 ng/mL inform eligible EVIDENCE study call result . If meet eligibility criterion study eliminate participant condition may affect ability safely perform neuromuscular function test , consume vitamin D supplement , undergo muscle biopsy , people inform another study whose vitamin D level insufficient . If interested , ask come baseline visit ( long visit occur within 2 month EVIDENCE screen visit ) . Those person screen 2 month ago EVIDENCE study eligible study lab work test perform may longer accurate .</detailed_description>
