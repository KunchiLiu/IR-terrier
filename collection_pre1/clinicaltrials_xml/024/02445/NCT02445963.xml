	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Artificial Invaplex ( Shigella Flexneri 2a InvaplexAR ) Administered Intranasally Healthy , Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vaccine administer Days 0,14 , 28 . Volunteers ( 10 per group [ 8 minimum ] ) receive dose vaccination dependent upon group assignment . Groups divide accord table . An interval le 1 week separate third dose group first dose next group ( receive increase InvaplexAR dose ) . Blood , stool , saliva specimen collect pre-specified interval examine systemic mucosal vaccine antigen-specific immune response . Ocular tear sample collect group C D. Vaccine safety actively monitor vaccination 28 day follow third vaccine dose . The decision advance next dose level base safety assessment ( immunogenicity ) . A dose level occurrence stop criterion 7 day follow last vaccine dose prompt move next high level . All safety data summarize review research monitor prior dose escalation . In addition , report safety data provide sponsor 's safety office informational purpose .</detailed_description>
