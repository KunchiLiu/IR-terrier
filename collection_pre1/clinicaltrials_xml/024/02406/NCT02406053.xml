	<detailed_description>Introduction Lung particularly important organ interface environment . The environmental pollutant endogenous reactive oxygen metabolite inflammatory cell exert substantial pathological effect lung cell [ 1 ] . Oxidative stress ( OS ) major factor play significant role lung cancer ( LC ) [ 2 ] , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) [ 3 ] obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) [ 4 , 5 ] . The current evidence suggest OS take part mechanism involve initiation , promotion progression respiratory disease . The major exposure cause OS summarize smoking , ambient air pollution contain particulate matter small aerodynamic diameter 2.5 µm [ 6-8 ] . Epidemiological clinical study show overall outcome pulmonary OS increase mortality due increase incidence respiratory diseases [ 9 ] . In OSAS , episodic hypoxia-reoxygenation cycle occur intermittent nocturnal hypoxia cause production reactive oxygen metabolite [ 10 ] . These metabolite responsible activation inflammatory cell OSAS [ 11 , 12 ] , increased level eventually cause ischemia-reperfusion injury [ 13 ] , cellular DNA damage [ 14 , 15 ] . The latter , also significant contributor LC progression . The DNA damage presence reactive oxygen metabolite yield carcinogenesis several mechanism . Some single double-stranded DNA break , modification purines pyrimidine . Nevertheless , OS susceptible factor carcinogenesis , also many pathological mechanism contribute cancer development , reactive nitrogen specie , involvement mitochondrial DNA mutation [ 16 ] inflammatory condition . Previous study report LC occur two-to-five time high patient moderate-to-severe COPD [ 17 , 18 ] . OS also main etiological factor COPD , particularly important acute exacerbation disease [ 19 ] . The parenchymal damage COPD include mechanism chronic inflammation , OS , deterioration balance protease antiprotease activity , apoptosis [ 20 ] . The major etiological factor suspect play role progression LC COPD report chronic inflammation , cause induction several interleukin cyclooxygenase-2 activity . The inflammatory micro-environment potential medium contribute neoproliferative process , interact regulatory mechanism apoptosis angiogenesis [ 21 ] . Some biomarkers available evaluate OS live organism [ 22 ] . Some biomarkers malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ) . Each biomarkers involve oxidative process . MDA by-product polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation [ 23 ] . Lipid peroxidation oxidation reaction reactive oxygen metabolite polyunsaturated fatty acid , eventually cause change structure permeability lung membrane [ 24 ] . The second biomarker , 8-OHdG , primarily involve DNA damage . The mechanism damage guanine : cytosine adenine : thymine transversion DNA replication [ 25 ] , induce microsatellite instability , abnormal apoptosis necrosis [ 26 ] . The third biomarker CoQ10 , also mediator lipid peroxidation , essential cofactor electron-transport chain ( ETC ) . It also lipophilic antioxidant component lipid membrane [ 27 ] . In study .</detailed_description>
