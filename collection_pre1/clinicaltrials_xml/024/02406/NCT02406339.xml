	<brief_title>Effectiveness NMES Associated Vascular Occlusion Functional Performance Muscle Hypertrophy Athlete 's</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pre-season preparation see vital maximize sport performance . However , much debate best strategy prepare use . Basketball sport activity high intensity volume jump , generally likely cause injury result muscle imbalance dynamic overload . Primarily activity eccentric contraction knee extensor muscle . A mean prevent injury optimization sport performance strength training . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) physical therapy effective increase recruitment muscle fiber strength . Another method show effective increase strength muscle hypertrophy association low intensity train peripheral vascular occlusion . Therefore , purpose study evaluate effectiveness neuromuscular electrical stimulation associate vascular occlusion lower limb muscle recruitment , strength muscle hypertrophy . This meet recruited basketball athlete high performance , male , age 18 30 year BMI 20 24 Kg/m2 . The athlete randomize four group : group control ( n = 20 ) , group electrotherapy ( n = 20 ) group electrotherapy + vascular occlusion ( n = 20 ) . Will carry 12 session treatment pre-season , volunteer evaluate pre-season middle season , follow instrument : Isokinetic Dynamometer , Surface Electromyography , Force Platform , Cross Section Area Muscle , Vertical Jump , Functional Evaluation ( Jump , Agility Balance ) , Infrared Thermography Numeric Scale Pain Evaluation . For data analysis , normality test use verify data distribution consistent statistical test appropriate comparison within group , thus consider two factor comparison , time group . Will adopt significance level 5 % .</detailed_description>
