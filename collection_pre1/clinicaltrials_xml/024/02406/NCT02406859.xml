	<brief_summary>An injury spinal cord result number secondary medical problem , include inability voluntarily control bowel . Depending severity location injury , remain bowel function differs , include combination follow : constipation ( prolonged stool retention ) , difficulty evacuation ( difficultly move bowel ) , fecal incontinence ( problem retain stool appropriate move bowel ) . Most current medication treatment option address problem constipation difficulty evacuation , option individual suffer incontinency . In study , investigator propose study , detail , anorectal muscle function individual spinal injury - investigator use new technology call high resolution manometry - present investigator 3 dimensional representation pressure profile anorectal muscle subject attempt different maneuver . A subgroup representative level completeness injury anorectal muscle function enrol participate six week biofeedback train see bowel function improve . During six week , subject ask visit laboratory twice week order train research team improve anorectal strength function response visual cue . After six week , another manometry study perform . Subjects send home ask perform series home exercise another 6 week , ask return third final manometry study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utility Animated Bowel Biofeedback Training Routine Improve Bowel Function Individuals With SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurogenic bowel characteristic differ among spinal cord injure ( SCI ) individual , appear depend primarily level completeness injury . It think upper motor neuron lesion spinal cord L1-2 result hyperreflexive bowel increase colonic wall tone loss cortical control relaxation external anal sphincter ( EAS ) . These change result chronic high sphincter tone dyssynergic defecation . The main symptom patient constipation fecal retention , difficulty evacuation ( DWE ) . In many individual , nerve connection spinal cord colon may preserve , stool propulsion reflex coordination may remain intact control central nervous system . Furthermore , individual spinal lesion T7 experience loss voluntary control abdominal muscle inability increase intra-abdominal pressure , result DWE constipation . Lower motor neuron ( LMN ) lesions spinal cord L1-2 result interruption centrally mediate innervation bowel , cause slow peristalsis , flaccid EAS , atonic levator ani muscle . This also call areflexic bowel . The main symptom patient constipation slow peristalsis fecal incontinence ( FI ) atonic EAS levator ani muscle . While symptom bowel dysfunction person SCI know , function motility anal canal document population . Anorectal manometry provide valuable information sphincter strength , defecation dynamic reflex mechanism . New high-resolution anorectal manometric system ( Given Imaging , Duluth , GA ) , simultaneously capture pressure data rectum , IAS , EAS atmosphere . High resolution manometry also allow much clear display pressure event compare line trace series , direction contraction much easy discern . To date , anorectal high resolution topographical study conduct SCI population . Modalities patient train control internal anal sphincter ( IAS ) EAS promising solution FI , show useful able body ( AB ) population . For example , anorectal biofeedback method teach patient recognize sensation distend rectum also teach abdominal pelvic muscle voluntarily contract short period time order improve continence . Such biofeedback modality also show decrease constipation AB population teach proper external sphincter relaxation rectal muscle contraction . The concept biofeedback base principle operant conditioning , information concern normally subconscious physiological function relay patient become actively engaged learn consciously control function . During bowel ( ) training program , patient provide visual feedback voluntary reflex sphincter rectal muscle contraction , learn recognize diffuse sensation gradually regain control .</detailed_description>
