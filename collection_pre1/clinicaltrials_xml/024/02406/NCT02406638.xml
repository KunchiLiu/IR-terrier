	<detailed_description>Introduction : The three dimensional ultrasonography ( 3D USG ) provide clear spatial orientation polypropylene tape help clarify pathogenesis bladder dysfunction TVT procedure . Thus , USG urogynecology postoperative show increase role monitoring surgically treat patient specially complication urinary retention urinary disorder . Objective : Compare 3D USG tape spatial orientation , three different technique insertion mid-urethral synthetic sling , correlate USG finding postoperative result average three year follow-up . Methods : This transversal study cohort woman surgically treat stress urinary incontinence retropubic sling ( TVT-R ) , transobturator sling ( TVT-O ) single-incision sling ( TVT-S ) . The surgery occur May 2009 December 2011 . Were eligible study 158 patient . The clinical USG evaluation perform medical visit , April 2013 June 2014 , local ethic committee approval signature inform consent . The objective cure rate evaluate negative pad-test stress test . The subjective cure rate urgency symptom access questionnaire . The subjective cure define absence report stress urinary leakage . The USG evaluation perform use General Electric Voluson 730 expert system 8 - 4 Mhz volume transducer 85-degree acquisition angle . The exam perform patient supine position hip flex use slightly abduce , void . The US transducer place perineum midsagittal position volume obtain rest , maximum Valsalva , perineal contraction . Moved mode render OMNINI View plan previous described.The volume datasets analyze offline author . They blind average value consider . The urethral length location sling , measure distance bladder neck tape ( CF ) , assess midsagittal plane . The tape angle relation urethra assess OMINI VIEW plan . Statistical analysis perform use student , ANOVA Tukey-test . P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
