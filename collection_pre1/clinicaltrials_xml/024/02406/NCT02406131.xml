	<brief_summary>The investigator establish relation restenosis inflammatory response shear stress cause angioplasty suggest mechanism affect inflammatory response consequently affect restenosis rate .

	<brief_title>Effects Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Restenosis Post Lower Limb Revascularization Angioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The father interventional radiology Charles Dotter ( 1920-1985 ) perform first percutaneous transluminal angioplasty university Oregon hospital Laura Shaw 16th January 1964 . She present typical rest pain foot gangrene leave leg angiogram show distal superficial femoral artery focal stenosis . He save leg walk next 3 year life use experimental dilating catheter Later 1977 Zurich witness first coronary angioplasty German cardiologist Andreas Gruentzig ( 1939-1985 ) use technique . The angioplasty utilized gradually next year Dotter provide less invasive option grow number peripheral vascular disease patient estimate range 3 % 10 % , increase 15 % 20 % person 70 year . Early diagnosis remain difficult patient tend asymptomatic 50 % vessel narrowing . strong association prevalence peripheral vascular disease age increase demand world population age specially western Europe USA . The low extremity revascularization USA statistic year 2000 40/100,000 increase . Restenosis gradual narrowing vascularized vessel remain one main problem usually occur within 6 month angioplasty . Restenosis percentages varies 12 % 63 % different study largely depend lesion type site knee intervention liable restenosis . The restenosis phenomenon explain physiological response trauma cause balloon inflated compress atheroma . Many factor influence process e.g . patient , procedure vessel condition intervention.it consider hypertrophic wound heal interaction monocyte-derived macrophage , T cell arterial wall .the inflammatory response lead Neointimal Hyperplasia terminology use describe proliferation migration vascular smooth muscle cell . Elevated inflammatory coagulation factor marker level angioplasty suggest predictor possibility restenosis . The inflammatory theory support use immunosuppressive drug like Sirolimus show positive effect reduce restenosis rate . Ischemic precondition introduce first mechanism reduce subsequent myocardium injury apply intermittent period sub-lethal ischemia . Subsequently concept examine body organ . The mechanisms remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) work subject many study suggest neural , humoral anti-Inflammatory pathway . Animal study suggest powerful anti-inflammatory effect RIPC . study show endothelial protection decrease formation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) upregulates endothelial nitric oxide ( eNOS ) synthase responsible vasculature Nitric Oxide important protective molecule reperfusion shear stress injury . In human study Ischaemic , precondition show endothelial protective effect alter Neutrophils function include reduce adhesion , exocytosis , phagocytosis , modify cytokine secretion . . In one study , RIPC stimulate modify leukocyte inflammatory gene expression correlation first second window RIPC , 1-2 hour 12-24 respectively . Sampling Frame peripheral vascular disease patient medical profile , match trial criterion wait admitted emergency department low limb revascularization angioplasty Galway university hospital , identify . Recruitment stop 10 month 16 month trial period . Trial Design Patients need revascularization angioplasty classically history symptomatic peripheral vascular disease usually assess OPD use ABI send duplex ultrasound scan get CT angiogram Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) . Furthermore , intra operative image common practice . investigator recruit group accordance trial protocol . The target number 40 patient divide 2 group . All group candidate undergo base line assessment include history , examination , duplex , ABI blood sample inflammatory coagulation marker . The candidate randomly allocate : Randomisation Age DM associate many comorbidities . Randomization stratify two confounders use Minimpy computer software . All trial candidate unique number identify conceal identity . Patients file lock trial office one-person access candidate get number sequential way accord allocation . Projected recruitment . Galway University hospital provide vascular service population approximately 750000 serve West-North West Hospitals Group . The patient trial actively recruit patient 's clinic , patient theatre book database . Information trial give vascular team include criterion selection exclusion . Those qualified counselled trial team consent agree join . The target 40 patient achievable within recruitment window . Patient recruitment &amp; consent Eligible candidate get information trial write verbal explanation step . Patients willing take part ask provide write informed consent . Three copy consent form sign : one patient , one patient 's clinical note file one copy patient 's trial folder . Data collection Demographic clinical data eligible candidate agree participate collect . The candidate assign trial number identifier informed consent sign personal information available data entry sheet . The original data-entry preform retain together copy consent form trial office trial document trial office CSI building . The code key trial number limited Chief Investigator . Encrypted back copy prepared end data entry keep look separately . All data retain care principal investigator period five year closure trial . Statistical analysis A trial team member blind trial allocation perform statistical analysis respect primary secondary outcome . This pilot study result use identify need large trial . Trial monitor Day-to-day management trial responsibility trial manager , supervise principal investigator . A meeting hold every two week trial manager principal investigator monitor recruitment , data collection etc .</detailed_description>
