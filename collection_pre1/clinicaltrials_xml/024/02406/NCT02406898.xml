	<brief_summary>Hysteroscopic surgery gold standard intra uterine pathology especially fibroma . Limit technic duration procedure correlate operative complication . So , patient large fibrome several fibroma , technic indicate performs several time . A new technic hysteroscopic surgery available quicker conventional technic . This technic poorly evaluate .

	<brief_title>Evaluation Hysteroscopic Morcellator Hysteroscopic Treatment Submucosal Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Material Methods We propose monocentric-randomised study . Inclusion criterion woman 18 year require hysteroscopic surgery fibroma . After informed consent , patient randomise two group : hysteroscopic surgery morcellation technic conventional hysteroscopy technic resection . The main objective duration procedure . Secondary objective characteristic perioperative complication ( distension medium quantity , cervical injury , uterine perforation ) , immediate et long term postoperative data 's ( postoperative pain synechia ) . We hypothesis hysteroscopic morcellation reduces duration procedure 50 % . The estimated size population number 30 per group 60 study . Expected result We expect significant decrease procedure duration hysteroscopic morcellation . This data interest accord peroperative complication correlate procedure duration allow hysteroscopic surgery patient large several fibroma .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient least 18 year . Patient effective contraception . Patient underwent ultrasound confirm presence least one uterine fibroid diameter le 6 cm large fibroid .
