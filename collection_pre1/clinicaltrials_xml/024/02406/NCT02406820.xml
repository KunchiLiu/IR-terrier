	<brief_summary>HF001 prospective observational study utilize non-invasive medical device may able discriminate change heart failure acutely decompensated patient undergo routine interventional therapy hospital set . Subjects monitor use CVInsight™ [ CVI ] via finger and/or forehead sensor , perform isometric handgrip stress test ( IHGST ) . Changes CVI signal analyze correlated standard assessment heart failure include pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC ) pressure , blood pressure ( BP ) , patient symptom , physical exam finding . The result study use develop powered study determine new configuration non-invasive monitoring device use monitor heart failure status sensitively current non-invasive technique .</brief_summary>
