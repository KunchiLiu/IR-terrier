	<brief_summary>This protocol randomize , open-label , national , multicenter trial study maintenance treatment lenalidomide dexamethasone versus lenalidomide , dexamethasone MLN9708 autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patient newly-diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma . A total 316 patient , study GEM2012MENOS65 , enrol study . The pre-treatment period include screen visit participant provide informed consent write order take part study . The patient assess determine his/her eligibility . The selection process begin 21 day first dose medication administer ( day -21 0 ) . All procedure pre-treatment period carry completion two cycle post-transplant consolidation VRD coincide end-of-study visit clinical trial GEM2012MENOS65 . During treatment period , eligible patient include study receive maintenance treatment lenalidomide/dexamethasone versus lenalidomide/dexamethasone/MLN9708 . Each cycle last 28 day . Treatment arm A consist oral administration 15 mg/day oral lenalidomide day 1-21 , 20 mg/day dexamethasone administer orally day 1-4 9-12 period two year . Arm B maintenance treatment arm A , addition MLN9708 two year maintenance period , dose 4 mg/day day 1 , 8 15 cycle . At two year , patient negative MRD finish maintenance treatment . Patients positive MRD continue treatment lenalidomide/dexamethasone complete five year maintenance treatment . In case , 20 mg/day dexamethasone administer day 1-4 cycle . The dose lenalidomide adjust . ( unless necessary treat adverse event ) Once phase active treatment complete , patient begin long-term follow-up phase , visit every three month evaluate progression survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary trial objective : • Impact progression-free survival ( PFS ) add MLN9708 post-transplant maintenance treatment lenalidomide/dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma . The secondary trial objective : - Evaluate development clinical significance minimal residual disease ( MRD ) time maintenance treatment initiate , yearly five year . - Overall survival ( OS ) . - Evaluate safety tolerability maintenance treatment .</detailed_description>
