	<brief_summary>This study determine whether addition cyclophosphamide pomalidomide dexamethasone improve progression free survival patient relapse refractory myeloma ( RRMM ) compare pomalidomide dexamethasone alone . Patients randomise 1:1 basis receive CPD Pd . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma second common hematologic malignancy European Union ( EU ) , responsible estimate 21,000 death EU 2008 . For patient relapse refractory current standard treatment ( combination bortezomib/lenalidomide , dexamethasone alkylating agent ) option available therefore prognosis within group often poor response treatment decrease successive relapse resistant disease develop . . Current standard treatment first relapse UK use bortezomib combination dexamethasone cyclophosphamide . Another common treatment lenalidomide give dexamethasone cyclophosphamide . The addition cyclophosphamide demonstrate improve treatment outcome whilst tolerate well . A recent clinical study show addition cyclophosphamide combination pomalidomide dexamethasone show safe tolerable beneficial term treatment outcomes . The primary aim study investigate whether addition cyclophosphamide pomalidomide dexamethasone lead improved progression free survival . A secondary aim identify marker clinical material predict response pomalidomide group relapse refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) patient provide important information use discussion NICE best improve value use pomalidomide UK RRMM setting .</detailed_description>
