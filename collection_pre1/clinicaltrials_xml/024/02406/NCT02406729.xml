For efficacy analysis consider dengue case occur 28 day post-vaccination entire population 16944 participant . For safety analysis participant divide three age group : 18 59 y , 7-17 y 2 6 y . In age group minimum 4992 participant . The age group 18 59 y 7 17 y start first . Once safety data first 21 day vaccination analyse 450 participant 7-to17-ys age group , follow group , 2 6 y , start . The study 's hypothesis vaccine investigation produce Butantan Institute safe provide protection dengue symptomatic disease 80 % low bound 95 % confidence interval 25 % .
