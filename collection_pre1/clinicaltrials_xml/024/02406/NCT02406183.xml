	<brief_summary>The prognosis advance metastatic melanoma remain poor although breakthrough achieve novel anti-CTLA-4 treatment ( ipilimumab ) subset patient . Unfortunately , due immune resistance , majority patient obtain long-lasting clinical benefit . Radiotherapy able interfere immune resistance induce immunogenic cell death . Preclinical evidence indicate combine radiotherapy anti-CTLA-4 treatment increase response rate compare single agent treatment . These data support several spectacular clinical case one retrospective study . The investigator hypothesize combine ipilimumab radiotherapy result high response rate compare ipilimumab radiotherapy monotherapy . Given complexity interaction anti-tumor immunity , first goal project assess safety combine treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial SBRT With Concurrent Ipilimumab Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety profile ipilimumab SBRT well study separately 22-24 , prospective data combination ipilimumab high-dose SBRT lacking . Consequently , first goal propose prospective phase I trial ass safety ( dose limit toxicity , DLT ) combination high-dose SBRT ipilimumab patient advance melanoma .</detailed_description>
