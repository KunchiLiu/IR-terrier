	<brief_title>Impact Tracheotomy Procalcitonin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procalcitonin ( PCT ) , soluble protein compose 116 amino acid sequence identical calcitonin prohormone , consider reliable biomarker evaluate bacterial infection sepsis . In healthy individual , serum PCT concentration undetectable , however , case severe bacterial infection sepsis , increase rapidly release mainly peripheral blood mononuclear cell modulate bacterial lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) sepsis-associated cytokine . An increase number study demonstrate PCT-guided strategy helpful approach guide antibiotic administration clinical intervention intensive care unit ( ICU ) . However , PCT induce plasmas patient presence bacterial infection , also stress condition severe trauma surgery . In condition , increase moderate . The mechanism nonspecific increase complicate . Other condition elevate PCT concentration include medullary thyroid carcinoma , cancer , anaphylactic shock , heat shock , cardiac arrest , Kawasaki Disease , . These finding suggest elevate PCT level lack speciality detect sepsis critically ill patient . Tracheotomy one perform surgical procedure assure airway make hole front trachea ICU . There study literature show surgical procedure neck area cause surgical stress , increase thyroid hormone . The procedure may due miscellaneous clinical sign alter hormone level , even create thyroid storm . As far aware , study impact tracheotomy PCT concentration . The aim study evaluate whether tracheotomy affect PCT concentration patient without sepsis . Moreover , investigator assess whether operative duration procedure correlation peak PCT level .</detailed_description>
