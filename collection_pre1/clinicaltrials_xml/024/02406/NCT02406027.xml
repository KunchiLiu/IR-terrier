	<detailed_description>Participants early Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) spectrum , enrol ongoing future clinical trial JNJ-54861911 ( Phase 1b Phase 2 study ) provide opportunity participate study upon completion treatment period parent protocol . The study consist Screening phase 2 sequential treatment phase ( 12-month double-blind [ DB ] treatment phase [ placebo control ] open-label [ OL ] phase [ active ] ) follow End-of-Treatment visit . Treatment OL phase continue registration JNJ-54861911 ; unless safety issue emerge determine Data Review Committee ( DRC ) would warrant termination study . Blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sample collect evaluate plasma CSF pharmacokinetics JNJ-54861911 , well amyloid beta fragment . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
