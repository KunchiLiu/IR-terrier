We compare two active condition offer HIV risk reduction intervention ( HIVRR ) intervention arm . This design allow u examine addition MF HIVRR might lead superior outcome compare receive HIVRR alone . HIVRR intervention financial literacy deliver research staff vocational training deliver field site staff . In month 6 , recruitment begin .

Self-reported data behavioral outcomes collect via audio computer-assisted self-interview ( ACASI ) assess baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month post-intervention . We implement survey time point . Primary outcome measure via biological assay Neisseria gonorrhea , Trichomonas , Syphilis , common STIs find among FSWs Kazakhstan , well HIV HCV . Biological outcome assess baseline , 6 12 month post-intervention . Follow assessment start month 15 final 12 month follow complete month 51 . For Aim 4 , conduct qualitative study woman 's experience HIVRR+MF component , unique impact study condition structural factor associate risk among FSW-PWID . For Aim 5 , collect cost data relate intervention component every 6 month month 6-50 . Data analysis commence year 5 follow dissemination finding . Qualitative Study . To help open `` black box '' delivery HIVRR+ MF , investigator conduct semi structure in-depth interview 3 point time implementation HIVRR intervention . Following HIVRR financial literacy component ( 4 week post-baseline ) , investigator randomly select 2 participant arm per cohort ( total N=48 woman 12 cohort ) complete first 3 interview .
