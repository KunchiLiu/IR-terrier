	<brief_summary>This research study compare different drug combination possible treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) bone metastasis . The name study intervention involve study : - Combination Radium-223 Sorafenib - Combination Radium-223 Pazopanib</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study Radium-223 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-Targeted Therapy Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve combination sorafenib radium-223 combination pazopanib radium-223 treatment disease . Sorafenib pazopanib approve single agent treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Additionally , radium-223 FDA approve treatment advanced prostate cancer show effect prostate cancer . Currently , limit option patient metastatic renal cell cancer also bone metastasis . Bone metastases relate high incidence skeletal complication , include skeletal pain , fracture , spinal cord compression , increase amount calcium blood . Such skeletal complication could result radiation surgery bone . Since radium-223 show effective patient metastatic prostate cancer also bone metastasis , researcher want explore radium-223 VEGF-targeting therapy understand drug combination affect safety , quality life , incidence skeletal complication , progression cancer .</detailed_description>
