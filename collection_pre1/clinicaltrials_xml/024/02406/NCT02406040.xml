	<brief_summary>Weight loss energy restriction result loss fat muscle mass . Muscle mass important mobility , strength , glucose control energy expenditure , therefore retention muscle mass energy restriction important goal . The retention muscle mass depend balance muscle protein synthesis ( MPS ) muscle protein breakdown ( MPB ) . It well know MPS reduce weight loss , however effect weight loss MPB currently topic debate . The purpose study assess effect short-term ( 10 day ) weight loss ( 40 % energy deficit ) MPS MPB order gain insight mechanism cause muscle loss energy restriction . In addition , effect resistance exercise protein ( know preserve muscle mass ) MPS MPB examine</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An undesirable consequence energy restriction loss muscle mass . Muscle mass determine rate two process : muscle protein synthesis muscle protein breakdown . It consistently show reduced rate muscle protein synthesis exist energy restriction . However , currently unclear whether increase muscle protein breakdown also contribute muscle mass loss . In addition , effect high protein diet resistance exercise muscle protein turnover energy restriction , two intervention know preserve muscle , remain investigated.We aim demonstrate decrease muscle protein synthesis main contributor negative protein balance energy restriction . In addition , hope show higher-protein diet ( 2.4g/kg/d versus 1.2g/kg/d ) addition resistance exercise help maintain muscle protein synthesis rate thereby improve negative protein balance.The present study design parallel group randomize control trial . Subjects give pre-packaged diet ( Copper County Foods ) consume put relative energy deficit 40 % per day . Based random assignment , subject either consume adequate protein diet ( 1.2g/kg/d ) high protein diet ( 2.4g/kg/d ) 10 consecutive day . Participants adequate protein diet consume ratio 50:35:15 ( carbohydrate : fat : protein ) subject within high protein diet consume ratio 50:15:35 ( carbohydrate : fat : protein ) . Subjects undergo test baseline follow 10 day dietary unilateral resistance exercise intervention . Testing consist muscle blood sample . Muscle protein synthesis muscle protein breakdown measure use stable isotope tracer orally ingest ( deuterated water ) infuse antecubital vein ( labelled phenylalanine tracer ) 10 day diet .</detailed_description>
