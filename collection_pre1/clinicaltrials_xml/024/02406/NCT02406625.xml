	<brief_title>Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Adolescents With Suicidal Behaviors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Suicidal behavior represent public health problem due high prevalence low predictability . At neurological level , high vulnerability suicidal behavior relate frontostriatal-cingulum tract dysfunction well attention , memory executive deficit . It also know brain development continue adolescence , therefore , therapeutic intervention period might propitiate neural change could favor emotional regulation involve suicidal behavior . Specifically , Dialectical Behavioral Therapy prove effective regard problem . The investigator hypothesis DBT ( Dialectical Behavioral Therapy ) improve clinical symptom associate suicidal behavior , well neural interconnection , result structural functional connectivity change , also well cognitive functioning . The investigator aim investigate clinical , neuropsychological , neural effect Dialectical Behavioral Therapy adolescents suicidal behavior . The investigator method randomize , control study include 30 patient suicidal behavior 15 healthy control age 12 18 year . Patients assign one two group ( randomize ) : DBT Regular Support Therapy . Clinical neuropsychological evaluation perform treatment patient group . Additionally , Structural MRI data set , diffusion-tensor imaging ( DTI ) Functional Connectivity ( Resting State fmri ) acquire patient control baseline treatment . Initial characteristic compare three group , investigator also compare clinical , neuropsychological imaging measure treatment .</detailed_description>
