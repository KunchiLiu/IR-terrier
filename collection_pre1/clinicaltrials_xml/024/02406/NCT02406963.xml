	<brief_summary>A pilot research study plan occur within pediatric urology service spring 2015 . All pediatric urology patient immediate post-operative period 0-14 day eligible study . This study compare current standard care manage post-operative complication ( telephone conversation NP ) versus experimental intervention ( telephone call electronic photograph surgical site ) . Before surgical patient discharge hospital , consent obtain participation . Once family initiate contact NP post-operative concern randomize either control experimental group . Those control group receive current standard care , telephone advice . Those experimental group speak NP telephone request send electronic photograph child 's surgical site NP assessment advice . Photographs assess use standardized tool NPs information enter database . The investigator measure number emergency department ( ED ) and/or unplanned clinic visit group . An unplanned clinic visit define visit require due unexpected complication concern original schedule post-operative follow-up determine surgeon . The investigator track number follow-up phone call group , well require participant complete family/patient experience survey speak NP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design pilot randomize control trial . Consent study obtain within circle care immediately patient discharge home follow surgery . The family instruct contact NP telephone post-operative question concern child . Once family initiate contact NP , randomize either experimental ( PEC ) group control ( TTC ) group . Once randomization occur , NP obtain necessary information parent address point expertise base script develop Pediatric Urology Team group . Those randomized control group ( TTC ) provide recommendation base information obtain standard telephone call . Families randomize PEC ( experimental ) group require send digital photograph child 's surgical site professional email address NP . Should agree send digital photograph require give consent email correspondence , email NP . Once consent may send digital photograph NP child 's surgical site , assess NPs use expertise-based assessment tool . This information enter REDCap . The NPs come unanimous decision regard advice provide communicated parent . Upon completion interaction NP RA contact family complete family/patient experience survey telephone . Family/patient experience measure use adapt validated tool `` Nurse Practitioner Satisfaction Survey '' consist 10 question directly relate telephone interaction NP . This survey consist Likert Scale score range 1-5 5 positive response . Follow telephone call group log MediTech well RedCAP database . All telephone call document within MediTech system include patient 's chart order maintain current standard care . All digital photo print placed patient 's chart delete email server , current process engage PEC . Recruitment study occur 7 month aim recruit 40 patient per arm order obtain feasibility data . However , sample size calculation carry assume 75 % power alpha error 5 % use one sided test , require sample size answer definitive research question 114 patient per group . Data analyze compare number ED unplanned clinic visit group , well number follow phone call receive . This do use descriptive statistic t-test independent mean . Family/patient experience also measure two group ( PEC TTC ) use descriptive statistic t-test independent mean . Subgroup analysis do determine subgroup post-operative patient benefit PEC ( i.e. , penile surgery ) .</detailed_description>
