	<brief_summary>Although cervical cancer preventable cancer , every year one-quarter million woman die worldwide disease . Internationally nationally , cervical cancer disease affect predominantly woman poor live resource poor setting . With device investigator develop , know Multispectral Digital Colposcope probe , goal make detection precancerous cervical lesion easier patient provider . For patient , goal reduce number clinical visit need obtain diagnosis treatment consequently reduce result fear anxiety usually accompany abnormal Pap smear . For provider health care system , goal obtain accurate diagnosis currently available diagnostic method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multispectral Digital Colposcope With Probe Detection Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The multispectral digital colposcope ( MDC ) specialize lightsource image device mount custom-made colposcope acquire sequence fluorescence image . This version MDC incorporate upgraded light source , update firmware user interface . This result short acquisition time improve image spectrum quality control . The MDC also consist point probe use take detailed light measurement ( call spectroscopy ) small region cervix . The goal study see whether MDC perform good standard method detect cancerous pre-cancerous abnormality cervix . Study subject swab detection type Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) . After vinegar apply cervix per usual colposcopy practice , MDC use take sequence image cervix . Next 2-4 reading take cervix use point probe . This data use train , test validate algorithm specific MDC . The ability algorithm detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia compare standard clinical care ( colposcopy ) . The MDC image pathology result compare spectroscopy data MDC probe . The investigator determine spectroscopy equal sensitivity colposcopy detect high grade lesion .</detailed_description>
