	<brief_title>Apixaban Pharmacokinetics Bariatric Patients ( APB )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity lead health problem 21st century . Weight reduction conservative method include diet exercise poor success rate . There substantial increase use bariatric surgery provide sustain weight loss thus reduction medical comorbidities associate obesity . However , procedure may alter anatomical physiological aspect gastrointestinal system , possibility alter pharmacokinetics medication particularly take orally . Furthermore , patient typically lose anywhere 50 75 % estimate excess body mass approximately one two year follow surgery . This successful therapeutic outcome surgery may cause long term change pharmacokinetics independent direct anatomical physiologic change induce procedure . Physicians surgeon interested oral anticoagulant special patient population . To date , approve dose obese patient ( especially consider surgical intervention bariatric surgery ) . VTE one top two cause morbidity mortality bariatric surgical patient . In ninth edition Antithrombotic Therapy Prevention Thrombosis guideline publish American College Chest Physicians ( 1 ) , report virtually bariatric surgical patient least moderate risk VTE , many patient high risk . ( 2 ) The approach VTE prophylaxis use bariatric surgeon today combination non-invasive pharmacologic technique , include sequential compression device , anti-embolic stocking , anticoagulation , early ambulation . Traditionally VTE prophylaxis accomplish subcutaneous injection however introduction new oral anticoagulant medication many practitioner use anticoagulant without demonstration effectiveness population . The Johns Hopkins Center Bariatric Surgery interested conducting pharmacokinetic study apixaban ( oral anticoagulant FDA approval use VTE prophylaxis treatment ) obese adult population determine bariatric surgery influence apixaban exposure . More interesting would see dose may need change pre- vs. post-bariatric surgery ( important physician patient undergo procedure worldwide many may require anticoagulation future healthcare ) . Specific Aim 1 : To determine pharmacokinetics apixaban obese patient schedule bariatric surgery body mass index ( BMI ) 35 kg/m2 great . Hypothesis 1a : Obese patient prior bariatric surgical intervention , compare normal weight historical control , decrease Cmax area curve ( AUC ) give single dose 5 mg apixaban . Specific Aim 2 : To determine pharmacokinetics apixaban bariatric surgical patient undergone Roux-en Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy ( VSG ) 1 , 6 , 12 18 month post-op . Hypothesis 2a : Patients recently undergone RYGB surgery ( 1 month post-op ) decrease Cmax AUC , relative pre-op value , give single dose 5 mg apixaban . Hypothesis 2b : Patients recently undergone VSG surgery ( 1 month post-op ) decrease Cmax AUC , relative pre-op value , give single dose 5 mg apixaban . The magnitude decrease Cmax AUC less see RYGB patient . Rationale : Anatomic alteration GI tract immediately reduce absorption post-operative bariatric patient . In RYGB patient , attenuate small bowel alter bile acid composition lead decrease absorption drug , whereas sleeve gastrectomy patient prolong gastric emptying may affect pharmacokinetics . These finding important consider use apixaban oral anticoagulation option perioperative VTE prophylaxis bariatric population , acute hospital set discharge patient require extend VTE prophylaxis treatment . Hypothesis 2c : After undergo bariatric surgery , patient 6 , 12 , 18 month post-op increase Cmax AUC , relative pre-op value , give single dose 5 mg apixaban . Hypothesis 2d : After undergo RYGB , patient 6 , 12 , 18 month post-op great increase Cmax AUC , relative pre-op value , VSG patient relative pre-op value give single dose 5 mg apixaban . Rationale : Patients 6 18 month post-bariatric surgery generally 30-40 % decrease excess body weight . This decrease body weight reduces volume distribution drug , potentially affect Cmax . Results publish Phase 1 apixaban study find exposure dose apixaban inversely relate body weight . Therefore , investigator expect high plasma level apixaban patient 6 18 month post-bariatric surgery compare pre-op value . Findings Phase I study ( 3,4 ) An open-label , parallel-group , non-randomized , single-dose study healthy male female subject conduct assess effect body weight pharmacokinetics single 10 mg dose apixaban . Following screening , patient enrol one three group : low body weight ( ≤50kg , N=18 ) , normal body weight ( 65-85kg , N=18 ) high body weight ( ≥120kg , N=19 ) . Compared normal body weight : - There 27 % increase Cmax 20 % increase AUC patient low body weight - There 31 % decrease Cmax 23 % decrease AUC patient high body weight The effect RYGB vs. sleeve gastrectomy long-term pharmacokinetics difficult predict oppose effect great weight loss reduce absorption RYGB patient . These finding important consider apixaban oral medication long-term post-op bariatric patient may require anticoagulation stroke , myocardial infarction , atrial fibrillation orthopedic procedure hip knee replacement . ( 5 , 6 ) Specific Aim 3 : To measure effect apixaban Factor Xa activity ( chromogenic anti-Xa activity assay ) bariatric surgical patient pre-operatively 1 , 6 , 12 18 month post-operatively . Hypothesis 3a : In spite change pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics response ( measure chromogenic anti-Xa activity assay ) differ 10 % compare pre-surgical response 1 , 6 , 12 18 month surgery . Rationale : The change pharmacokinetics lead different concentration-response relationship chromogenic anti- Xa activity individual patient follow dose apixaban 5 mg . Were significant change pharmacodynamics , factor due alter anatomy substantial weight loss would need invoked explain altered relationship .</detailed_description>
