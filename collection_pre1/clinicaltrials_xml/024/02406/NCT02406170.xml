	<brief_summary>Patients advance oesophagogastric cancer ( OCG ) poor prognosis . After progression first line therapy , second line chemotherapy paclitaxel VEGF-R2 target antibody proven benefit survival . However , data available combination paclitaxel kinase inhibitor advance OGC . Here investigator propose Phase 1b study assess tolerability regorafenib ( oral multi kinase inhibitor ) combination paclitaxel assess uptake paclitaxel OCG metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regorafenib Combination With Paclitaxel Advanced Oesophagogastric Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Regorafenib new oral multikinase inhibitor angiogenic , stromal oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase . Regorafenib demonstrate increase overall survival patient metastatic colorectal cancer approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , well The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) . In recent phase IB study combination regorafenib FOLFOX FOLFIRI show tolerable treatment regimen first- second-line treatment colorectal cancer . Unfortunately , data available show effect regorafenib chemotherapy uptake metastasis . Here investigator propose phase IB study advance OGC cytotoxic treatment consist paclitaxel together regorafenib , assess tolerability combination second line therapy metastasize OGC assess effect regorafenib paclitaxel uptake OGC metastasis . Primary objective : To assess tolerability regorafenib combine paclitaxel . Secondary objective To assess effect regorafenib uptake paclitaxel OGC metastasis . To assess effect regorafenib regorafenib target OGC metastases blood sample . To assess effect regorafenib paclitaxel pharmacokinetics . To obtain exploratory data efficacy combination regorafenib paclitaxel . Study design : A phase 1b study tolerability regorafenib combination paclitaxel . Study population : Patients advance oesophagogastric cancer , fit second line treatment systemic treatment . Intervention : The investigator perform phase 1b dose find study ( phase I ) expand cohort evaluate uptake paclitaxel OCG metastasis . Paclitaxel test cytotoxic backbone combination regorafenib advance OGC . Paclitaxel dose 80 mg/m2 I.V . infusion Days 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day cycle report previously use recent RAINBOW study ( NCT01170663 ) . Patients receive regorafenib daily day 1-21 28-day cycle . The first cycle start day 2 first administration chemotherapy pharmacodynamics/kinetic purpose . From second cycle onwards , regorafenib dose day 1-21 . Four different dose level assess . After maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define , correspond patient cohort expand 33 patient assess effect regorafenib uptake paclitaxel OGC metastasis day 1 15 first cycle ( phase II ) . Rationale start dose : Paclitaxel dose 80 mg/m2 I.V . infusion Days 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day cycle report previously use recent RAINBOW study The first dose Regorafenib escalation scheme 80mg per o qd . In phase 1 study optimum dose regorafenib monotherapy set 160mg per o q.d . However , consider potential side effect paclitaxel combination regorafenib investigator choose start dose 80mg per o qd . Dose level Paclitaxel dose Regorafenib dose Minimum number patient -1 80mg/m3 i.v 40 mg p.o . qd 1 . ( start ) 80mg/m3 i.v 80 mg p.o . qd 3 2 . 80mg/m3 i.v 120 mg p.o . qd 3 3 . 80mg/m3 i.v 160 mg p.o . qd 3</detailed_description>
