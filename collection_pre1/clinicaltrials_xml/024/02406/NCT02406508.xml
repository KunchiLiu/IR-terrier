	<brief_title>Sequential Melphalan Use With Hepatic Delivery System Treatment Followed Sorafenib Patients With Unresectable HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm , open label , multi-center , phase 2 study evaluate safety efficacy sequential treatment Melphalan/HDS follow sorafenib patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) confine liver . Eligible patient receive 3 Melphalan/HDS treatment . Each treatment cycle consist 6 week acceptable delay another 2 week next planned treatment . The Melphalan/HDS treatment terminate patient progressive disease ( PD ) , complete response ( CR ) , &gt; 8 week delay recovery toxicity last PHP treatment . With exception patient PD , patient treat sorafenib complete Melphalan/HDS treatment . Patients PD manage standard care off-study treating physician .</detailed_description>
