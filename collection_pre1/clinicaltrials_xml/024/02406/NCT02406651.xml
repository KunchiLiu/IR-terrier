	<detailed_description>This Phase IIa single arm open-label study investigate safety , tolerability , PK F-652 combination systemic corticosteroid subject undergone HSCT newly diagnose grade II-IV low GI aGVHD . The HSCT may derive bone marrow , peripheral blood stem cell , cord blood . The PK F-652 subject population investigate . Subjects may replace subject withdrawal relate safety treatment response . F-652 administered conjunction prednisone ( equivalent ) time onset clinical symptom consistent GI and/or liver aGVHD . Prednisone ( equivalent ) give dose 2 mg/kg/day taper per protocol . F-652 administer intravenously rate 100 mL/hour one hour per week four week . A total 4 dos administer dose 45 μg/kg . Subjects follow safety efficacy Day 180 , subject survival status collect Day 365 . In first stage trial , total 16 subject enrol . If six few Day 28 treatment response , trial close due lack efficacy . If seven response , additional 11 subject enrol study total sample size 27 . During course subject 's therapy , dose reduction may occur individual basis per protocol .</detailed_description>
