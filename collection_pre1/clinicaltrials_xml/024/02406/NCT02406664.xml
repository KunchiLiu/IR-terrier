	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine change kidney function blood pressure gastric bypass versus conventional medical therapy morbid obesity . The study mainly focus glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) know relation renal function 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor intervention gastric bypass medical treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Bariatric/Metabolic Surgery GFR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome strongly associate obesity patient syndrome increase risk cardiovascular disease . Obesity constitute strong risk factor development chronic kidney disease . Among diabetic , obesity know amplify risk kidney disease . Bariatric surgery yield dramatic result include longitudinal loss excess body weight either complete reversal significant improvement several feature metabolic syndrome . In addition , many observational study demonstrate significant reduction proteinuria bariatric surgery . However , change component cardiovascular problem among metabolic syndrome change renal filtration function progression end stage kidney disease morbidly obese patient weight loss surgery extensively study . Therefore , study mainly focus glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) know relation renal function 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor intervention gastric bypass medical treatment .</detailed_description>
