	<brief_summary>Current pattern P2Y12 receptor inhibitor use provide excellent opportunity test impact copayment reduction clinician choice medication , patient adherence , clinical outcome . The ARTEMIS trial practical multicenter , cluster- randomized clinical trial assess impact copayment reduction equalize copayment clopidogrel ticagrelor . ARTEMIS ass prescribe pattern , patient medication adherence , clinical outcome one year . We hypothesize reduce -- -- pocket cost P2Y12 receptor inhibitor lead improve adherence . Additionally , copayment reduction generic brand antiplatelet agent may lead reduction MACE risk . This part due great adherence evidence -- base secondary prevention medication . Additionally reduction MACE may reflect great selection potent antiplatelet agent show reduce MACE randomized clinical trial , provider choice antiplatelet therapy primarily drive risk- benefit assessment rather cost burden patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Affordability Real-world Antiplatelet Treatment Effectiveness After Myocardial Infarction Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ARTEMIS prospective , cluster-randomized clinical trial evaluate whether patient copayment elimination significantly influence antiplatelet therapy selection long-term adherence , well patient outcome overall cost care acute myocardial infarction . Approximately 11,000 patient ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) non-STEMI ( NSTEMI ) enrol approximately 300 hospital study . Study sit select ARTEMIS geographically diverse , represent diversity hospital type capability ( e.g. , teach hospital , community hospital , etc ) . After institutional review board ( IRB ) approval study , hospital randomize either intervention arm control arm . Hospitals randomize intervention arm opportunity offer enrol patient either clopidogrel ( generic P2Y12 receptor inhibitor option ) ticagrelor ( brand P2Y12 receptor inhibitor option ) without patient contribution copayment next 12 month index MI discharge . Hospitals control arm provide care per usual clinical routine . Notably , intervention control arm , patient management decision ( include choice antiplatelet therapy ) completely discretion care provider . Duration antiplatelet therapy also discretion care provider . All enrol patient follow 15 month index MI discharge collect data longitudinal treatment pattern outcomes . Primary secondary endpoint assess 12 month . An additional three month follow assess antiplatelet persistence clinical event discontinuation copayment intervention . Centralized follow-up conduct every 3 month via telephone web-based contact .</detailed_description>
