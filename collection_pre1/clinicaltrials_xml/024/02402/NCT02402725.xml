	<brief_summary>This phase II , open label , single-center study ultra-high dose dexamethasone administer intravenously orally monotherapy treatment relapse multiple myeloma . Dexamethasone known anti-myeloma activity , study extensively alone , combination agent , treatment multiple myeloma . This study implement optimal 2-stage design . In Stage 1 , 10 patient enrol . Each patient receive 100mg intravenous dexamethasone Day 1 , immediately follow 24mg oral ( PO ) dexamethasone every 6 hour 3 day ( Days 1-3 ) 28-day cycle . After 4 cycle , patient evaluate efficacy safety . If 2 original 10 patient experience CR , good partial response ( VGPR ) , PR , additional 20 patient enrol Stage 2 . The enrollment Stage 2 occur completion 4 cycle ultra-high dose dexamethasone . If &lt; 2 patient experience CR , VGPR , PR , study discontinue . Patients treated progression , intolerable side effect , death . The purpose propose phase II study determine overall response rate , progression free survival , tolerability `` ultra-high '' dose dexamethasone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary objective : • Determine antitumor activity ultrahigh dose dexamethasone ( UHDD ) monotherapy relapse multiple myeloma . Secondary objective : - Characterize safety tolerability UHDD monotherapy patient relapse multiple myeloma . - Determine progression free survival amongst responder . - Determine subset patient UHDD use monotherapy treatment relapse multiple myeloma STUDY ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint : To determine anti-tumor activity UHDD monotherapy patient relapse multiple myeloma measure International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) response criterion : - Change baseline M protein component . - Objective response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) assess accord IMWG response criterion . - Disease control rate ( CR+PR+stable disease [ SD ] ) . Secondary endpoint : - Safety tolerability UHDD - Progression free survival . - Characteristics patient respond UHDD .</detailed_description>
