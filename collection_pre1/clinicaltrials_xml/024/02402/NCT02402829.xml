	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Factor Level Inhibitor Titer Testing Results Drawn From Central Venous Lines Venipuncture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients hemophilia A B sometimes require placement central venous line ( CVL ) . A CVL medical device place vein give easy access vein either blood draw give factor replacement product . Patients hemophilia usually see hemophilia doctor every year annual comprehensive clinic visit . As part visit , doctor usually order routine blood test , include factor level inhibitor titer.The factor level inhibitor blood test always take `` peripheral stick . '' A peripheral stick mean small needle insert vein order obtain blood sample . The CVL use blood draw . This investigators n't know infusion factor replacement product heparin ( blood thin drug use flush line factor infusion ) cause blood sample result incorrect . The current practice take blood needle stick vein investigator sure result accurate . When blood draw take peripheral stick , cause child hemophilia anxious pain involve needle stick . Also , needle stick sometimes cause bleed , may require treatment . The purpose research study see factor level inhibitor level accurate draw CVL instead peripheral stick .</detailed_description>
