	<brief_summary>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) technique emerge prospective therapy neurologic , psychiatric addictive disorder . Specifically , anodal tDCS apply dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) associate improvement cognitive function mood . Despite increase use clinical setting , tDCS suffers limitation , especially regard strength duration therapeutic effect . Strategies optimize condition tDCS application suffer lack knowledge neurophysiological impact . Moreover , tDCS increasingly used private setting commercial apparatus tutorial make `` do-it-yourself '' device deliver tDCS available Internet . This private use worry neuroscientists health authority . Even general impression , control condition , tDCS safe mild transient adverse effect , whether tDCS could use enhance cognition healthy subject need investigate detail . The investigator believe good understanding neurobiological effect tDCS crucial tailor tDCS experimental therapeutic application define recommendation private use . As cortex densely connect basal ganglion area , include dopaminergic area , tDCS probably capable target cortical also subcortical structure remote stimulation site . Some study suggest cortical stimulation approach , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) lead increase dopaminergic transmission . The involvement dopaminergic system tDCS effect investigate indirectly pharmacological study . Thus , direct effect DLPFC stimulation tDCS dopaminergic transmission still unknown . The aim project reveal online impact single-session tDCS apply bilaterally DLPFC healthy subject dopaminergic transmission measure PET , combine [ 11C ] raclopride bolus-plus-continuous-infusion method .</brief_summary>
