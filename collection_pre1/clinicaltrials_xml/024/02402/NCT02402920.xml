	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose pembrolizumab ( also call MK-3475 ) radiation therapy ( either chemotherapy alone ) give patient SCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial MK-3475 Concurrent Chemo/Radiation Elimination Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign part study group base join study . Up 3 group 3 participant enrol Part A 80 participant enrol Part B . If enrol Part A B , dose pembrolizumab receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level pembrolizumab . Each new group receive high dose pembrolizumab group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose pembrolizumab find . All participant receive pembrolizumab radiation therapy . The radiation chest area . In addition pembrolizumab , participant Part A also receive either cisplatin etoposide carboplatin etoposide . Study Drug Administration : You receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 3-week cycle . If Group A , Day 1 Cycles 1-16 , receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute . In addition , Day 1 Cycles 1-4 , receive cisplatin vein 2 hour etoposide vein 4 hour Days 1 , 2 , 3 . If unable tolerate cisplatin , receive carboplatin vein 30 minute etoposide vein 4 hour Days 1 , 2 , 3 . Study Visit : When receive radiation , every 3 week . - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) may draw routine test . Follow Up : Every 12 week last dose pembrolizumab , CT PET scan check status disease . You also PFTs perform . If unable make visit , contact phone check health . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 16 dos . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Radiation therapy deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method local control metastatic primary tumor . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment unresectable metastatic melanoma . It use study investigational . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
