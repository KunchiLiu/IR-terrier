	<brief_title>Evaluating Factors Involved Dymista 's Superior Clinical Efficacy Fluticasone Propionate Treatment Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main hypothesis trial Dymista affect multiple phase allergic response , sum great effect fluticasone propionate azelastine hydrochloride alone . Our objective study demonstrate : 1. induction allergic inflammation nasal provocation antigen cause cellular infiltration , subsequent release inflammatory biomarkers cause augmented response subsequent exposure antigen . 2. fluticasone prevents allergic inflammation develop antigen challenge subsequently prevent augmentation nasal response nasal challenge antigen . 3. azelastine Dymista reduces effect release histamine To address hypothesis perform 3-way , randomize , placebo-controlled , crossover trial . We recruit 20 asymptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis patient outside relevant season . The subject receive placebo , fluticasone propionate Dymista . The nasal provocation separate 2 week . Treatment begin 15 minute nasal provocation ragweed grass antigen treatment continue twice day 3 day . Nasal provocation occur daily three day evaluate priming ( increased sensitization repeat antigen exposure , mimic seasonal disease antigen exposure occur set continue allergic inflammation ) . For outcome measure , monitor nasal symptom nasal provocation well collect nasal lavage evaluate effect eosinophils biomarkers immune response . In nasal lavage , quantify number eosinophil ( marker cellular recruitment ) measure level histamine ( marker basophil mast cell activation ) , tryptase ( marker mast cell activation ) , albumin ( marker vascular permeability ) , lactoferrin ( marker glandular activation ) ECP ( marker eosinophil activation ) . Thus expect generate information clinical effect physiologic difference treatment .</detailed_description>
