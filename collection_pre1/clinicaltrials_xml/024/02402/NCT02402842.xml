	<brief_summary>Squamous cell carcinoma anal canal ( SCCA ) rare disease mostly diagnose early stage . After standard concurrent chemoradiation ( CRT ) mitomycin ( MMC ) 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) , disease recur 20 % patient . After treatment failure ( include salvage surgery ) , cisplatin-5FU combination standard option complete response rare event prognosis remain poor patient ' death occur first 12 month . Decision make physician set base retrospective study small phase II clinical trial include less 20 patient . Hence , efficient standard care currently available relapse SCCA patient currently treat palliative intent . Between 2007 2013 , 8 consecutive patient advance recurrent SCCA CRT treat DCF regimen ( docetaxel , cisplatin 5-fluorouracil ) Regional Cancer Institute Franche Comté . After median follow-up 41 month , 4 patient ( 50 % ) achieve complete response . Three patient underwent surgery involve metastatic site . A pathological complete response observe include metastasis occur irradiated field , suggest taxane-based chemotherapy might effective strategy circumvent resistance radiotherapy ( preliminary cohort 8 patient publish ( Kim S et al Annals oncology 2013 ) . Furthermore , complete responder HPV 16 , high level specific T cell response Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) HPV16-derived E6/E7 telomerase detect 50 % complete responder suggest potential restoration cancer immunosurveillance regimen . Then , Epitopes-HPV02 multicenter phase II study aim confirm new role taxane-based chemotherapy SCCA patient .</brief_summary>
