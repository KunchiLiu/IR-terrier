	<brief_title>Understanding Risk Factors Determinants Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuropathic pain ( NP ) common ( population prevalence 7-8 % ) present rise health burden future . NP arise consequence disease lesion somatosensory nervous system . NP result significant morbidity , reduce quality life major deleterious impact health age . However , everyone lesion develop significant neuropathic pain , develop include wide range severity , impact outcome , unpredictable response evidence-based treatment . The reason subject develop neuropathic pain others follow injury know . Genetic variant increasingly recognize important development neuropathic pain . There number Mendelian primary neuropathic pain disorder act exemplar high impact gene variant number case show alter primary afferent excitability . In addition genetic factor also likely important risk factor common acquire ( secondary ) neuropathic pain disorder . So , identify risk factor significant impact health identify vulnerable patient potential develop new treatment modality . The propose study part multicenter international project Horizons 2020 program European Union . Our aim understand pain pathophysiology term risk factor protective mechanism range molecular pathway societal impact . The desired impact provide firm platform improve diagnosis stratify patient accord risk profile , employ preventive strategy ultimately develop novel therapeutic . Specific objective study large : 1 ) Identify influence demographic , environmental/societal clinical factor risk develop maintenance NP . 2 ) To apply modern genomics validate ( use target approach ) find novel ( use genome wide association ) genetic risk factor NP . 3 ) To determine patient stratification use physiological ( sensory profile , endogenous analgesic mechanism nerve excitability ) psychological factor predict NP risk progression . 4 ) Development risk model/algorithm ( severe ) NP , combine measurable genetic environmental factor . The desired impact provide firm platform improve diagnosis stratify patient accord risk profile , employ preventive strategy ultimately develop novel therapeutic .</detailed_description>
