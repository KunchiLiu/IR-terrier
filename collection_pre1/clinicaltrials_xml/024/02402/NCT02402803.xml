	<detailed_description>Despite reduction cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) mortality past 20 year , CVD remain leading cause mortality United States , account ~1 every 3 death . CVD cost U.S. $ 100 billion annually important field target primary secondary prevention . Dyslipidemia , particularly high low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level , well-established cardiovascular risk factor , fast lipid panel ( include total cholesterol , LDL-C , triglyceride , high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol [ HDL-C ] ) include recent 2013 ACC/AHA Risk Assessment Guidelines . Clinical trial show low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) reduction statin therapy predict cardiovascular event reduction . About quarter adult &gt; 45 year old statin therapy 2008 , likely increase due recent 2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Management guideline . These guideline recommend statin therapy patient clinical atherosclerotic CVD , patient LDL-C = 190 mg/dL , patient age 40-75 year diabetes LDL-C 70-189 mg/dL , patient estimate 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk = 7.5 % . For patient , fast lipid panel drawn prior statin initiation well follow-up assess medication lifestyle adherence . These fast lipid panel obtain via conventional phlebotomy via venopuncture office-based hospital laboratory set . Research protein quantitation mass spectrometry enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) technology allow sensitive quantitation protein biomarkers target , include lipoprotein . Most importantly , multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM ) mass spectrometry able ass sample dry blood spot ( DBS ) , whose advantage include minimal volume requirement , ease sample attainment finger stick minimal training require , ease transport , sample stability . DBS sample used clinical pre-clinical study , simplify sample collection handling . However , research protein quantitation mass spectrometry ELISA compare conventional blood sample evaluate change cholesterol level statin therapy . While LDL-C well-established predicting CVD event reduction , laboratory lipid , thrombotic inflammatory biomarkers show associated atherosclerotic plaque development CVD risk . These include Apo A-I , Apo B , Apo E , IgM , plasminogen , TIMP-1 , Von Willebrand factor , antithrombin III , cystatin C , mesothelin , C-reactive protein , SAA , LPS-binding protein , mannose-binding lectin , myeloperoxidase , fibrinogen , alpha-1-acid glycoprotein , soluble transferrin receptor , haptoglobin . All CVD protein biomarkers measure research protein quantitation technique . In pilot study 20 subject , aim : 1. measure change panel CVD protein biomarkers initiation statin therapy . 2. compare clinical laboratory measurement LDL-C HDL-C conventional phlebotomy blood sample research protein quantitation mass spectrometry ELISA measurement LDL-C ( Apo B ) HDL-C ( Apo A-I ) proteins DBS plasma .</detailed_description>
