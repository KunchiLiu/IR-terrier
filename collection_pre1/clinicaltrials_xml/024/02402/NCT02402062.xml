	<criteria>Male female , 18 year age old . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Histologically proven diagnosis pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( pNET ) Ki67 assessment ≤ 20 % ( well moderately differentiate ) Evidence unresectable disease metastatic disease . Locally advanced disease must amendable resection radiation therapy curative intent . Patients may treat somatostatin analogue prior trial . Concomitant prior interferon treatment permit . Documented progression disease CT scan , magnetic resonance ( MR ) Octreoscan 12 month prior basal visit . Measurable disease per RECIST . Measurable lesion previously radiate consider target lesion unless increase size observe follow completion radiation therapy . Patient able swallow medication . Life expectancy great 12 week . The definition minimum adequacy organ function require prior study entry follow : Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , AST ALT ≤ 5 x ULN liver function abnormality due underlie malignancy Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/µL Platelets ≥ 100,000/µL Hemoglobin ≥ 5,6 mmol/L ( 9.0 g/dL ) Creatinin clearance &gt; 40 mL/min ( Cockcroft Gault formula ) Adequate cardiac function : 12lead ECG without pathologic finding ( clinically significant alteration allow ) Echocardiogram / Normal multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) ( LVEF &gt; 50 % ) Signed date informed consent document indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrollment . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Previous treatment chemotherapy , monoclonal antibody antivascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor , interferon permit advanced disease . Prior treatment another hypoxiaactivated prodrug clinical trial . Major surgery , radiation therapy , systemic therapy within 3 week study randomization except palliative radiotherapy nontarget metastatic lesion . Prior highdose chemotherapy require hematopoietic stem cell rescue . Immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine , tacrolimus , azathioprine , longterm oral glucocorticoid take concurrently within last 3 month prior randomization Treatment know inhibitor inductor cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) prolong QT interval previous 7 day . Prior radiation therapy &gt; 25 % bone marrow . Current treatment another clinical trial . Uncontrolled brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , leptomeningeal disease . Patients complete surgery radiation therapy exist brain metastasis , document increase size previous 3 month prior first dose treatment study asymptomatic . Diagnosis second malignancy within last 3 year , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix . Any follow within 12 month prior start study treatment : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , congestive heart failure class III IV New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) patient clinical history congestive heart failure class III IV NYHA , unless echocardiogram MUGA previous 3 month selection show LVEF ? 45 % significant heart valve disease cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack pulmonary embolus .
