	<brief_title>Treatment Severe Peanut Allergy With Xolair ( Omalizumab ) Oral Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) , food protein consume increase amount , study good result , allergic reaction major problem . Anti-IgE antibody ( omalizumab ) block allergy antibody allergic reaction absent . A new test basophil cell stimulate allergen vitro , CD-sens , show cell sensitivity , correlate well peanut challenge . Twenty children/adolescents , 12 22 year , severe peanut allergy treat omalizumab effect evaluate CD-sens . If CD-sens negative peanut challenge perform . If challenge negative OIT start : 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 g peanuts/day two-week interval follow maintenance dose 10 g peanuts/day continue treatment omalizumab . If CD-sens still negative withdrawal omalizumab start halve dose several step . The study independent pharmaceutical company . Omalizumab dose accord body mass amount total IgE antibody therefore every individual individual study duration . In average duration study estimate 52 week +/-40/20 week . Inclusion study expect last 2 come year . A treatment without serious side effect severe food allergy would give great benefit reduce anxiety fear , also major health economic benefit form few hospitalization , sick leave , great extent complete school education .</detailed_description>
