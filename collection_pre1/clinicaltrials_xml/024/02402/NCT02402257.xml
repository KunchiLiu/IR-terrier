	<brief_summary>The investigator previously successfully implemented central venous catheter ( CVC ) simulation-based mastery learning ( SBML ) curriculum Northwestern University . As result , trainee skill improve , complication , include central line associate bloodstream infection ( CLABSIs ) decrease curriculum proven cost-effective . Therefore Veterans Administration Medical Centers ( VAMC ) decide implement training site quality improvement project . The investigator train faculty location implement curriculum individual site . Outcome data collect evaluate outcome quality improvement ( QI ) project ( complication , infection , skill ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Central Venous Catheter Insertion Train Trainer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Beginning 2006 , Northwestern University Internal Medicine Emergency Medicine resident complete simulation-based mastery learn central venous catheter ( CVC ) insertion clinical rotation Medical Intensive Care Unit ( MICU ) . This comprehensive program central line training use repetitive practice simulation technology train resident mastery standard . This study important patient safety implication . This program result improved trainee skill reduce CVC insertion complication , include significant decrease rate central line associate bloodstream infection ( CLABSI ) . In addition , investigator show CVC insertion highly cost-effective suggest investment simulation train produce significant medical care cost saving . This curriculum successfully implement site . Due investigator ' success , VA request Medical Error Reduction Certification , Inc. ( MERCI ) along Northwestern University , implement curriculum site across county quality improvement project . Using train trainer course CVC placement , investigator interest analyze data VAMC provide MERCI study outcomes . Four Northwestern faculty complete CVC insertion Master trainer curriculum . One master trainer travel VA facility program facilitate two-day train-the-trainer course CVC insertion SBML . Each VA facility select one two `` faculty champion '' complete CVC insertion SBML course learn teach curriculum day 1 observe training assess peer healthcare provider institution day 2 . Course material include standardized videos lecture , role-playing practice sample learner CVC insertion assessment . In addition onsite master trainer , VA facility receive necessary training material ( standardized video lecture , data collection form , assessment tool ) equipment ( CentralLineMan simulator , ultrasound ) implement curriculum institution . All participant complete pre post test course evaluation questionnaire . Quantitative outcome data learner skill CVC insertion quality measure collect measure overall success project .</detailed_description>
