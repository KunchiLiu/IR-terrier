	<brief_title>Adjunctive Psychotherapy Perinatal Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The perinatal period appear especially destabilizing woman bipolar disorder ( BD ) , prospective study reveal mood episode morbidity 70 % pregnant woman disorder , risk postpartum mania high 50 % case . There clear negative sequela BD mother offspring , include gross maternal impairment , substantial risk suicide , high risk postpartum psychosis , adverse childbirth outcome . Yet data concern clinical management BD perinatal period strikingly limited . Pharmacotherapy complicate due know teratogenic risk certain medication , lack safety data others , difficult treatment decision , include decision discontinue pharmacotherapy , woman clinician face light limited data .

Interpersonal Social Rhythm Therapy ( IPSRT ) adjunctive psychosocial intervention may serve need , : ( ) incorporate key element Interpersonal Psychotherapy ( IPT ) , strong evidence base treatment perinatal depression unipolar sample , ( b ) include behavioral intervention stabilize circadian rhythm disruption may place perinatal woman high risk mood psychotic symptom , ( c ) establish efficacy treatment BD non-perinatal sample , ( ) carry promise potential clinical benefit without additional fetal exposure . Yet publish study evaluate efficacy IPSRT , psychosocial intervention , adjunct pharmacotherapy BD perinatal period . Given many potential benefit , primary aim R34 Exploratory Research Proposal ( PAR-12-279 ) adapt pilot IPSRT perinatal woman BD . The development phase study result treatment manual , train manual , fidelity scale test open trial 12 pregnant woman BD , treat early postpartum . The pilot phase examine feasibility acceptability propose recruitment method , research design , intervention , interventionist train program randomize 40 pregnant woman BD enhance treatment usual ( E-TAU ) E-TAU + IPSRT , deliver early postpartum . Primary outcome mood psychotic symptom 16 week postpartum . Additional outcome include medication adherence , maternal functioning , birth outcome ( secondary ) , increase social support circadian social rhythm stability ( tertiary ) . This pilot study lay groundwork large , stage II clinical trial ( R01 ) evaluate efficacy intervention improve clinical functional outcome among high risk , understudied population vulnerable transition pregnancy postpartum period .</detailed_description>
