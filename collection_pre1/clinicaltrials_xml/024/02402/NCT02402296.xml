	<detailed_description>Aim : To investigate efficacy β-glucan supplementation non-surgical periodontal therapy localize aggressive periodontitis ( LAP ) patient . Method : 30 subject randomly equally assigned receive scale root planing ; either placebo pill ( Group I ) β-glucan ( 100 mg/once day ) ( Group II ) , 40 day . Subjects clinically monitor day 0 day 91 . Gingival sample harvest hopeless teeth site investigate histologically immunohistochemically use matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -1 9 antibody form patient ; time interval .</detailed_description>
