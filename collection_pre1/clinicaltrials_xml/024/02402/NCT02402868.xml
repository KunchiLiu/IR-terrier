	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness intranasal ( IN ) ketamine compare standard intravenous ( IV ) ketamine administration simple reduction orthopaedic injury paediatric population . The aim ass IN administration equivalent current standard care , IV . The population study child 5-17 year age require simple orthopaedic reduction . Following double dummy approach overcome difficulty mask intervention , participant recieve IV IN intervention , one real drug . Procedural conscious sedation ( PCS ) assess use University Michigan Sedation Scale ( UMSS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomization concealment allocation pharmacy-controlled use computer-based random number generator . The treat physician , research assistant , participant blind intervention . Eligible participant randomize 1:1 allocation ratio stratify block design six either ( 1 ) IN ketamine ( single dose , 8 mg/kg prepare 0.9 % NS 3 mL syringe atomizer , maximum 1.5 mL ) PLUS IV 0.9 % NS 0.02 mL/kg ( 2 ) IV ketamine ( single dose , 1 mg/kg , maximum 100 mg ) PLUS intranasal 0.9 % NS 0.08 mL/kg divide naris . Due perceptible difference interventional route , participant receive IV IN intervention use double-dummy approach . For IN dose volume less equal 0.5 mL , entire dose deliver 1 nostril dos great 0.5 mL , dose divide equally naris . Adjuctive sedation give need form IV ketamine , 1 mg/kg every 10 minute participant achieve adequate sedation 20 minute ( UMSS score 4 ) . A figure atomizer device use deliver IN agent upload . Eligible participant ( define section 2.5 ) identify treat physician view radiograph perform clinical assessment . The physician inform research assistant ( RA ) participant eligible . The RA seek inform consent explain protocol family . Baseline demographic information obtain . Informed consent PCS pre-anesthetic assessment perform treat physician accordance usual standard care . UMSS score obtain trained RA 5 minute pre-intervention , intervention ( 0 minute ) every 5 minute thereafter 60 minute post-intervention participant ambulatory drinking well , whichever longer . Participants receive standard monitoring oxygen saturation , blood pressure , respiratory rate , apnea , heart rate , rash attend nurse physician every 5 minute per usual standard care . The usual standard care also include monitor post-anesthetic presence know idiosyncratic effect ketamine include vomit , seizure , headache , emergence reaction , hypersensitivity . The RA obtain information nursing record discharge . Immediately prior discharge , RA also record duration stay ED parental satisfaction PCS . 1 . Chiaretti et al . 2011 .
