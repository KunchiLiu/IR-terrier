	<brief_summary>Problem : Adolescent patellofemoral pain ( PFP ) major problem worldwide affect 7 % adolescent . Adolescents PFP long-lasting severe pain low quality life . Current treatment ineffective 60 % new treatment approach need . Solution : A novel multidimensional diagnostic approach combine imaging , physical activity level pain sensitisation adolescent PFP . This approach enable identification adolescent PFP benefit new treatment strategy use activity modification reduce load patellofemoral joint grade exercise improve load capacity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multidimensional Diagnostics Effect Activity Modification Young Adolescents With Patellofemoral Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : Adolescents recruit population-based cohort Aalborg Copenhagen consist total 16 public school . This cohort allow recruitment adolescent PFP follow category 1 ) adolescent participate sport outside school ; 2 ) adolescent involve sport minimum 3 time per week . In addition , randomly recruit age- gender-matched pain-free group cohort recruit form control group . Protocol : All adolescent request complete online questionnaire current pain problem . If report knee pain telephone . The telephone interview collect anamnesis adolescent parent invite clinical examination anterior knee pain insidious onset duration 6 week . If adolescent diagnose PFP invite participate project . Baseline measurement : PFP diagnose use eligibility criterion line previous clinical trial commonly accept criterion . All adolescent PFP cohort examine use self-report questionnaire , clinical examination , strength hip knee , MRI pressure pain threshold . Pressure pain threshold measure around knee , low leg forearm ass local secondary mechanical hyperalgesia thus sensitisation central nervous pain system . Additionally , cuff-algometry use asses temporal summation pain repeat stimulus condition pain modulation . The pain-free control group examine use measurement . The comparison adolescent PFP pain-free control group use 1-2 descriptive study main purpose describe young population base self-report questionnaire , MRI-scans , strength hip ad knee pain mechanism . Main study : Adolescents PFP ask participate main study investigates effect early activity modification grade exercise among adolescent patellofemoral pain . Using prospective cohort design investigator investigate effect novel treatment strategy aim temporary reduction load patellofemoral joint activity modification . After inclusion , custody holder adolescent PFP inform begin 4 week activity modification period avoid sport activity include school sport . This protocol cause temporary reduction load patellofemoral joint . At 4 week instruct begin predefined training protocol involve grade exercise . The purpose grade exercise increase load capacity tissue around knee .</detailed_description>
