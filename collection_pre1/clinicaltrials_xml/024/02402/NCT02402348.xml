	<detailed_description>Subjects sign inform consent medical record review , physical exam blood take lab test biopsy cancer take determine eligibility study . Following enrollment , subject begin take Metformin dosage 850 mg daily Days 1 3 ( morning breakfast ) . On day 3 study team call see subject tolerate Metformin . If tolerate , dose increase 850 mg twice day ( breakfast dinner ) start Day 4 . This dose continue 24 hour prior surgery , minimum 14 day extend 28 day dependent plan surgery date . The study team provide subject Metformin study diary record take pill issue communicate physician . They also contact phone plan visit day see body tolerate Metformin throughout treatment ( approximately every 3 day ) . On Day 14 plus minus 3 day ( 2 week star Metformin ) immediately prior surgery , physician collect blood sample . On day surgery , surgeon remove tumor send lab evaluation part standard cancer care . They also collect additional biopsy tumor research purpose test effect Metformin tumor cell . The subject follow 30 day surgery . The blood tumor sample collect send research lab WVU test effect Metformin , tumor genotype Metformin genotype interaction critical tumor cell metabolic parameter also anoikis-sensitivity .</detailed_description>
