	<brief_title>Evaluation Hypo-Safe Hypoglycaemia Alarm Device - Pilot 2 Study - Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective pilot trial demonstrate safety performance Hyposafe hypoglycaemia alarm device conduct clinical trial type 1 diabetes patient . 1.1.1 Safety The safety relate objective study evaluate incidence severity adverse event . The primary safety parameter number adverse event related device implantation study relate procedure time device implantation end study ( peri-operative complication include bleed infection , allergic reaction , occurrence harm , tension pressure surround tissue etc . ) 1.1.2 Performance To evaluate technical stability Hyposafe hypoglycaemia alarm device everyday activity . 1.1.3 Efficacy Since study healthy subject efficacy measure record . Episodes false alarm record order improve algorithm hypoglycaemia detection . 1.1.4 Usability The ability subject carry device every-day activity sleep subject experience respect pain discomfort evaluate .</detailed_description>
