	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine long term safety tolerability ALK-001 ( C20-D3-retinyl acetate ) , explore effect ALK-001 progression Stargardt disease patient age 12 60 year old . Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Tolerability Effects ALK-001 Stargardt Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-masked , parallel group , placebo-controlled study evaluate effect ALK-001 administer daily mouth subject Stargardt disease ( ABCA4-related ) . Stargardt disease rare genetic disorder lead damage retina result legal blindness . The onset symptom usually occur one 's teenage year , although symptom appear child young 4 year old . There currently treatment Stargardt . Stargardt disease cause defective ABCA4 gene , affect process vitamin A eye lead formation toxic vitamin A aggregate ( call `` vitamin A dimer '' ) eye . Vitamin A dimer think contribute vision loss Stargardt disease . ALK-001 chemically-modified vitamin A design replacement vitamin A. ALK-001 change specifically prevent formation toxic vitamin A dimer eye , without alter normal processing vitamin A enable vision . Trial participant randomly assign receive ALK-001 ( 30 subject ) placebo ( 20 subject ) one year . After one year treatment , half participant ( 10 subject ) receive placebo randomly cross receive ALK-001 follow 12 month , remain 10 subject continue placebo . All subject initially receive ALK-001 remain treatment 12 month . Follow-up visit take place 4 8 week initiation treatment ass safety tolerability , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 month assess safety , tolerability effect ALK-001 progression Stargardt disease . The study double-masked neither participant , clinical staff , sponsor , aware treatment allocation ( ALK-001 placebo ) . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review safety efficacy data throughout study .</detailed_description>
