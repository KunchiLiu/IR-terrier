Locally recurrent disease must amenable surgical resection radiation curative intent . Measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 Documented disease progression study entry Must receive least 1 chemotherapy regimen set metastatic disease Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 Adequate hematological function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500/mm^3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000mm^3 Adequate hepatic function within 14 day prior Cycle 1 Day 1 ( C1D1 ) : total bilirubin &lt; 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( except patient Gilbert 's syndrome must total bilirubin &lt; 3 time ULN ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤2.5 x ULN . In case know ( radiological and/or biopsy document ) liver metastasis , AST/ALT ≤5.0 time ULN acceptable . Amylase lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN Adequate renal function within 14 day prior C1D1 : estimate creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must agree use dual method contraception negative serum pregnancy test screening , male participant must use effective barrier method contraception sexually active female childbearing potential . For male female participant , effective method contraception must use throughout study 3 month follow last dose . To consider nonchildbearing potential , postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month naturally ( set post chemotherapy ) participant must surgically sterile . Must receive prior anthracycline taxane therapy unless clinically contraindicate Significant medical illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise participant 's ability tolerate therapy Women pregnant lactating Radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy approve anticancer therapy ≤2 week prior cycle 1 day 1 Major surgery within 4 week Day 1 Unstable cardiovascular function : Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities require treatment , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) New York Hearth Association ( NYHA ) Class ≥3 ; myocardial infarction ( MI ) within 3 month Uncontrolled infection require parenteral antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal within one week prior first dose . Potential participant control infection prophylactic antibiotic permit study . Known history HIV Known active hepatitis A , B , C infection require treatment Any underlying condition would significantly interfere absorption oral medication Grade &gt; 2 peripheral neuropathy baseline ( within 14 day prior cycle 1 day 1 ) Participation investigational anticancer study within 3 week prior Cycle 1 Day 1 Coagulation problem active major bleeding within 4 week prior C1D1 ( peptic ulcer , epistaxis , spontaneous bleed ) Active central nervous system ( CNS ) malignancy . Asymptomatic small lesion consider active . Treated lesion may consider inactive stable least 3 month .
