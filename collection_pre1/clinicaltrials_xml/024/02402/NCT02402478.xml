	<detailed_description>Obtaining participant consent Patients invite read study information sheet encourage ask question research , write informed consent seek patient : ) completion baseline health questionnaire ; b ) provision blood sample long-term storage analysis DNA biomarkers ; c ) extraction patient data medical record ; ) linkage patient data national electronic health record data source ( e.g . cod hospitalisation procedure , emergency admission cause-specific mortality ) . Sample size For sufficient power detect relative risk difference 1.2 5 % significance level minimum 3000 patient require . Baseline data collection measure Three unique source data contribute participant baseline assessment , take place patient ' schedule hospital appointment . Research measure ( biological specimen information routinely collect patient ' clinical assessment ) include 1 ) blood sample DNA biomarker analysis 2 ) short health questionnaire complete participant ( usual completion time 5-10 minute ) . Clinical measure 3 ) detail clinical information collect part usual care , extract hospital electronic health record six month baseline assessment allow time procedure test result upload hospital electronic system . A . Collection research measure ( ) Blood resource Venous blood sample processing sample Non-fasting blood sample obtain consent participant , include diagnosis angina subsequently rule , staff trained venepuncture hospital appointment . Twenty millilitre blood drawn enable wide range research measure obtain . Blood drawn five vacutainers follow order : 2x 4.0 mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tube ( EDTA ) , 1x 4.5 mL gel-separator lithium heparin tube ( plasma separation tube ( PST ) ) , 1x 5.0 mL gel serum separator tube ( SST ) , 2x 4.0 mL , 1x 2.5 mL PAXgene ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) blood tube ( PreAnalytiX , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . Vacutainers gently invert revert five time allow additive mix blood , label temporarily store approximately 5째C processing . Date time collection record . Different blood fraction separate centrifugation 2500 g 10 minute . EDTA PST sample centrifuge within four hour sample SST sample leave clot room temperature 25-30 minute prior centrifugation . EDTA plasma , heparinised plasma , serum white cell ( buffy coat ) aliquoted total nineteen 0.5 mL 2D QR-coded cryovial tube suitable long-term cryopreservation . Each cryovial individually log two un-linked database use single-tube QR-code reader , place 96-position rack store locally -20째C . PAXgene RNA tube store whole blood -20째C . Buccal swab sample collection Consenting patient provide venous blood sample invite provide buccal swab subsequent DNA extraction . Samples collect rub sterile swab firmly inside participant 's cheek lip gum line one minute . The swab store sterile container silica gel capsule ( Isohelix Dri-Capsules , Cell Projects Ltd ) stabilise sample room temperature two year . Samples transport temperature-controlled shipping box long-term storage biobank -80째C . Extraction DNA single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) genotyping DNA extract 2556 individual participant sample genotyping 51 CHD-specific SNPs identify Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication Meta-analysis ( CARDIoGRAM PlusC4D ) complete , accord specification , company specialise service extraction DNA genotyping . Biomarkers metabolomic profiling patient The investigator propose measure routinely collect novel marker appear promise clinical predictive value , include N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-BNP ) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , apolipoprotein A1 ( apoA1 ) , apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) , lipoprotein A ( Lp ( ) ) , cystatin C. ( ii ) Baseline health questionnaire All participant invite complete questionnaire ascertain validate participant ' sex , level education , ethnicity health . General health functioning assess use EQ-5D , ( http : //www.euroqol.org/ ) 5-item standardised measure health outcome . Functional chest pain determine use Rose angina questionnaire angina severity use Canadian Cardiovascular Society ( CCS ) classification . Symptoms depression assess use Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9 ) , score nine Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM-IV 4th Edition , American Psychiatric Association ) criteria depression PRIME-MD ( Primary Care Evaluation Mental Disorders screen questionnaire depressive symptom ) diagnostic instrument common mental disorder . Anxiety assess use 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD-7 ) scale , self-reported measure screen quantify severity generalize anxiety disorder . ( iii ) Extended physical examination measure obtain sub-study Additional measure obtain subset participant include sixty-minute physical examination ( anthropometric measure , lung function , aortic blood pressure , pulse wave [ augmentation ] index , pulse wave velocity ankle brachial index ) , 31-hour ambulatory ECG , tri-axial accelerometry sleep measure . Sub-study participant also complete extended health questionnaire include question diet sleep . B . Extraction clinical information electronic health record Trained extractor review hospital database record detailed clinical information onto standardised case report form . Depending clinic hospital , different clinical system search manually extract data could download export data file . Information include reason ( ) referral , history chest pain , physician-recorded risk factor coronary artery disease , previously diagnose medical history , current medication test result . All participant underwent rest 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) part routine clinical assessment . An exercise tolerance test ( ETT ) undertake experienced cardiac electrophysiologist hospital perform ETTs routine assessment chest pain . The ETT follow modify Bruce protocol ( Bruce , RA , 1963 ) conduct concurrent 12-lead electrocardiography . Data manually enter onto research database study coordinate centre , clean cod ready analysis . Follow-up Postal questionnaire A postal follow-up questionnaire send study participant recruitment ( mean time follow-up 469 day ) assess general health status ( EQ-5D ) , functional status ( Rose angina questionnaire , Seattle angina questionnaire ) , symptoms depression ( PHQ-2 ) anxiety ( GAD-7 ) use nitrate medication . Electronic health record linkages With consent , investigator link participant data Hospital Episode Statistics , national data warehouse administrative data contain ICD-10-coded hospital diagnosis OPCS4-coded procedure . The investigator additionally link participant ICD-10-coded cause-specific mortality data Office National Statistics . The linkage conduct via NHS Health Social Care Information Centre ( formerly know NHS Information Centre ) patient identify use NHS number ( unique ten digit numeric identifier NHS ) , gender , date birth postcode . Data collection management The design , conduct , analysis reporting study follow methodological standard set REporting recommendation tumour MARKer prognostic study ( REMARK ) guideline . To maintain confidentiality , identifier remove source data replace unique participant study number assign point enrolment . Researchers train follow standardise operating procedure ensure high quality , consistent collection data . Data check validate , inconsistency clinical data resolve revisiting hospital data source .</detailed_description>
