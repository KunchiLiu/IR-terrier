	<brief_summary>The perianal region region around anus . Administering pain medication surgery start call preemptive analgesia . In study , technique show effective way reduce pain patient experience post-operative timeframe great extent would expect simply pain medication alone . One theory occur suggest preemptive analgesia desensitize brain nerve pain , thereby decrease response painful stimulus , like surgery occur . This lead decrease amount narcotic pain medication require procedure , lead less side effect quicker return normal functioning . As perianal surgery usually include long stay hospital , control post-procedure pain priority . The use preemptive analgesia type surgery , orthopedics , well establish , perianal region well study , use standard care . This type analgesia use combination medication already use post-operative non-operative pain control administer orally prior patient undergo general anesthesia . The side effect medication give surgery non-surgical pain . The concept preemptive analgesia establish type surgery solid basic science support use . The purpose randomized , double-blind , placebo control study determine patient undergoing perianal surgery could benefit preemptive pain control . The primary outcome whether patient experience less post-operative pain . Patient post-operative consumption latency use narcotic pain medication secondary outcome . The investigator believe patient receive pain medication operation require less pain medication surgery , minimal increase risk patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite advance pain medicine , postoperative pain control remain problematic 5 % patient experience severe pain despite standard care pain management , frequently cite reason delay discharge outpatient procedure [ 1 ] . In anorectal surgery , almost patient experience mild-to-moderate postoperative subjective pain [ 2 ] , example 12 % patient report severe postoperative pain recovery hemorrhoidectomy surgery [ 3 ] . Control postoperative pain important goal . Preemptive analgesia technique involve premedicating patient regimen medication design target different point pain cascade prevent central peripheral sensitization pain , also know `` wind-up '' [ 4 ] . The activation N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor identify process occur central sensitization noxious stimulus . By pharmacologically block receptor , may possible prevent suppress degree central sensitization , prevent hyperalgesic , exaggerate pain response , patient experience [ 5 ] . Peripheral sensitization similar concept occurs due noxious stimulus periphery , surgical incision . This type sensitization typically prevent regional anesthesia increase nociceptive threshold neuron different medication . Preemptive analgesia focus effect single medication pain control show promising result , however study appear lend practice [ 6-19 ] good others [ 20-26 ] . On hand , multimodal pain control regimens might promise . A search literature reveals preemptive pharmacological blockade wind effectively use surgical nonsurgical patient ( burn patient [ 27 ] ) . In patient undergo hip arthroplasty , hip replacement surgery , general anesthesia , block central peripheral sensitization result significantly decrease subjective pain , trend toward less postoperative use analgesic [ 28 ] . Similarly , patient undergo multilevel spinal surgery [ 29 ] undergo prostatic surgery [ 30 ] general anesthesia consume less postoperative analgesic undergo multimodal preemptive pain control block sensitization pathway . Finally , preemptive central sensitization blockade alone use trend improved pain control gynecological surgery general [ 31 ] regional anesthesia [ 32 ] . The preemptive use medication study anorectal surgery suggest study . Most pain control study literature focus postoperative rather preemptive medication regimens pain management [ 33-35 ] , current standard care effective regimen . The study effective decrease postoperative pain surgical context , patient undergo hip arthroplasty , use combination medication propose Treatment Group . Finally , add benefit anorectal patient population term putative decrease use opioids postoperative pain control revolve around opioid-related adverse effect bowel function . In fact , return bowel movement regularity one criterion healing surgery . Based exist literature , propose current study preemptively block central sensitization use intravenous ketamine perioperatively peripheral sensitization use intravenous dexamethasone administer perioperatively oral gabapentin acetaminophen administer preoperatively . Ketamine noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist act centrally dorsal horn spinal cord decrease release glutamate , reduce transmission pain message centrally [ 36 ] . Intravenous ketamine show decrease 24-hour opioid requirement , preemptive use ketamine part medication use study mention literature review . As currently stand , use ketamine anorectal surgery add analgesic proven safe . Among Nigerian surgery patient receive regional anesthesia preemptive ketamine , postoperative pain level show decrease , however unclear patient cohort include anorectal surgery patient [ 37 ] . No study conduct regard postoperative pain patient [ 38 ] . By utilize ketamine one medication study , hope show similar effect result patient experience decreased postoperative pain common anorectal surgery . Dexamethasone corticosteroid potent anti-inflammatory effect also use anti-emetic . The propose mechanism action dexamethasone completely know , think involve inhibition prostaglandin synthesis increase release endorphin . Endorphins endogenous peptide bind pain receptor body decrease pain . In addition , endorphins facilitate mood elevation sense well-being . Intravenous dexamethasone part medication use study mention literature review . One study investigate prophylactic use dexamethasone anti-emetic property , combination sevoflurane , general anesthetic , anorectal surgery find significant decrease maximal postoperative VAS pain score patient administer dexamethasone compare give placebo [ 2 ] . The use dexamethasone preemptive analgesic fully study anorectal surgery patient . Gabapentin act bind receptor voltage-gated calcium channel presynaptic nerve , reduce entry calcium presynaptic nerve terminal . The subsequent decrease release excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate , aspartate , substance P , norepinephrine synaptic cleft link diminished postsynaptic transmission neural pain message [ 36 ] . It usually use neuropathic pain control , use study mention literature review . A systemic review perioperative effect gabapentin find effective mean reduce post-operative pain , opioid consumption , opioid-related adverse effect surgical patient . In fact , administration single dose gabapentin find equivalent reduction 30 mg morphine first 24 hour surgery [ 39 ] . No study conduct , best knowledge , regard preemptive use gabapentin anorectal surgery . Local , peripheral sensitization also minimize use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) due decrease production certain molecule prostaglandins kinin . The enzyme require make molecule block acetaminophen NSAIDs , acetaminophen include study hope demonstrate good pain control among anorectal surgery patient . Acetaminophen weak analgesic form basic component multimodal analgesia regimen [ 36 ] . Oral preemptive use acetaminophen proven decrease postoperative narcotic use surgical patient [ 40 ] , use study mention literature review . A related intramuscular NSAID , namely Toradol , use preemptively among anorectal surgical patient good pain control [ 41 ] . No study report patient population . Of importance , combination medication use study use study similar high dos significant difference term hemodynamic variable ( vital sign ) adverse side effect note compare control group [ 31 ] . In fact , medication safely use UVM Medical Center collaborate surgeon part care surgeries abdominal surgery . *References 1-41 available upon request</detailed_description>
