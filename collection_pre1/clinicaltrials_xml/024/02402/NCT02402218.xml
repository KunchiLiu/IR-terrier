	<brief_summary>This study do compare three way give study drug Harvoni ( tablet include two drug also call Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir ) 12 week people infected Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) . Subjects receive drug part study . Subjects randomize one three treatment group : 1 . Usual care clinic . This treatment group receive standard care HCV treatment health care team . 2 . Usual care plus peer-mentors . In addition usual care , investigational strategy participant assign group ask interact peer-mentor someone cure HCV infection . 3 . Usual care plus incentive . In addition usual care , investigational strategy participant assign group give incentive complete certain treatment goal course study . HCV treatment Harvoni consider standard care HCV recommend expert liver disease infectious disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent advance Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) treatment represent paradigm shift treatment HCV-infected person Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) coinfection . With potent antiviral activity , excellent safety/tolerability , drug interaction daily , oral dosing , Sofosbuvir ( SOF ) /Ledipasvir ( LDV ) excellent efficacy randomize control trial offer great promise treatment hepatitis C HIV/HCV coinfected patient high risk progressive liver disease HCV-related mortality . In carefully control study conduct National Institutes Health Clinical Center , fixed-dose combination tablet SOF/LDV lead high rate HCV cure 50 patient HIV-infection . While availability SOF/LDV great promise treatment patient , experience antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) treatment HIV infection indicate interferon-free oral therapy necessary sufficient cure HCV real world . While removal Interferon increase proportion coinfected IDUs eligible treatment , multiple barrier remain ( e.g. , medical/psychiatric illness , substance abuse social constraint ) . Effective ART coinfected IDUs provide strategic framework delivery curative HCV treatment ; novel effective strategy deliver care HCV must evaluate , include incentive peer-mentoring . Financial incentive . One method increase delivery care contingent administration monetary incentive ; reinforcement improve health outcome related drug/alcohol abstinence , smoke cessation , childhood vaccination , tuberculosis care HIV treatment . Co-Investigator Dr. Brooner extensively study incentive increase drug abstinence among injection drug user ( IDUs ) . Contingent reinforcement also successfully use link HIV-infected patient care improve adherence ART . Curative HCV treatment give finite duration ( 12 week ) offer ideal paradigm incentive intervention reduce overall cost removing concern loss adherence incentive stop . Peer support . A second method improve delivery care use peer layperson illness . Co-Investigator Dr. Latkin lead research establish effectiveness peer ( drug user ) assist IDUs prevention treatment HIV infection . By match cultural competency establish trust , peer may particularly effective setting . In one study , African American veteran poorly control diabetes assign peer-support good glucose control assign financial incentive . Coinfected patient may benefit peer support . We test two innovative strategy improve HCV treatment outcome HIV/HCV coinfected patient delivery SOF/LDV 12 week part randomize controlled trial . HIV-infected patient receive SOF/LDV one three randomly assign condition : usual care ( clinic base nursing model ) , incentive care ( IC ) peer-mentor care ( PMC ) .</detailed_description>
