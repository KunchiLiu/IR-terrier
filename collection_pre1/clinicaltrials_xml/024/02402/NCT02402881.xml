Given high rate patient refusal VTE prophylaxis significant knowledge gap regard VTE , urgent need educate patient family importance benefit compliance VTE prophylaxis . The propose patient-centered education bundle deliver in-person , 1-on-1 discussion session nurse educator . Supporting education material include 2-page education sheet educational video . The investigator hypothesize patient refusal VTE prophylaxis associate significant knowledge gap among patient regard risk develop VTE benefit VTE prophylaxis deliver education bundle patient refuse VTE prophylaxis improve compliance VTE prophylaxis decrease rate VTE . Objectives Primary objective : determine impact deliver patient education intervention bundle rate VTE prophylaxis non-administration . Secondary objective : determine impact deliver patient education intervention bundle rate VTE . Methods The investigator develop real-time alert notifies member research team whenever patient miss dose VTE prophylaxis . This interventional study take place four hospital floor . Whenever nurse educator receive alert included floor indicate dose VTE prophylaxis miss , she/he visit floor , approach nurse charge patient find reason miss dose . If dose miss result patient refusal , nurse educator visit patient deliver education bundle comprise : 1 ) one-on-one education session , 2 ) patient education sheet 3 ) patient education video depend patient preference .
