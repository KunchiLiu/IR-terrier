	<detailed_description>The present study aim identify contribution 5-HT2A receptor system formation self personal meaning normal altered state consciousness . Specifically , effect 5-HT2/1/6/7 receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) self-consciousness , perception make mean assessed 25 healthy subject use randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind , cross-over design . Furthermore , contribution 5-HT2A receptor function shall assess pretreatment specific 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin .</detailed_description>
