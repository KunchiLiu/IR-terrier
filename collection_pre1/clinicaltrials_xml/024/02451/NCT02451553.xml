	<brief_summary>This phase I/Ib trial study side effect best dose afatinib dimaleate give together capecitabine treat patient solid tumor , pancreatic cancer , biliary cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment respond previous treatment . Afatinib dimaleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving afatinib dimaleate together capecitabine may better treatment solid tumor , pancreatic cancer , biliary cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Afatinib Dimaleate Capecitabine Treating Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors , Pancreatic Cancer Biliary Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) afatinib ( afatinib dimaleate ) combination capecitabine patient advance solid tumor ( phase I ) pancreatico-biliary cancer ( phase Ib ) . ( Phase I/Ib ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate biomarkers response metastatic tumor biopsy , include marker related epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) pathways via OncoPlex equivalent gene sequence assay . ( Phase I/Ib ) II . Evaluate rate response stable disease , duration response , time progression , progression-free overall survival . ( Phase I/Ib ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study afatinib dimaleate follow phase Ib study . Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 capecitabine PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
