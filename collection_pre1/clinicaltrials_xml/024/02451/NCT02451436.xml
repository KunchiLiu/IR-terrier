	<brief_title>A Sleep Media Use Intervention Improve Adolescents ' Weight Risk Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction . Over last 30 year , obesity rate adolescent triple , one-third adolescent obese 2010 . Many complication associate obesity , include glucose intolerance , hypertension , dyslipidemia marker inflammation interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , already present adolescence . The incidence type 2 diabetes adolescent also increase , especially minority . Current lifestyle intervention obesity type 2 diabetes focus alter energy balance show promising long-term outcome . Further research need well understand factor alter metabolism order create effective intervention . As obesity type 2 diabetes rate rise , adolescent ' sleep duration decrease . Despite require sleep child , adolescent often obtain adequate sleep . There many reason decrease sleep , include delay circadian rhythm , increase academic demand extracurricular activity , minimal parental supervision increase medium use . Media use among adolescent increase significantly last 5 year show affect adolescent ' sleep . It also find etiological factor adolescent obesity . Experimental study adolescent adult suggest inadequate sleep duration poor sleep quality associate insulin resistance , glucose intolerance , increase ghrelin increase marker inflammation.14-20 However , previous study successfully examined effect longer-term sleep intervention factor related obesity type 2 diabetes . We propose short sleep poor sleep quality may lead obesity type 2 diabetes 2 mechanism : 1 ) increase ghrelin , lead increase food intake , decrease energy expenditure impaired glycemic control,18 2 ) decrease insulin sensitivity , also increase insulin.16-20 These change energy balance metabolism could lead weight gain time increase adolescent ' risk type 2 diabetes . Methods . This study aim assess effect sleep medium use intervention adolescent body composition , ghrelin insulin sensitivity . In randomized controlled trial , 15-17 year old obese obtain adequate sleep randomize one two group : sleep intervention group study skill control group . The sleep intervention group receive four session include cognitive behavioral training aim increase sleep duration , education effect medium use sleep problem solve participant parent increase sleep duration decrease nighttime medium use . The control group receive four session study skill train . Sleep duration measure actigraphy , television use measure TV Allowance device ( Family Safe Media , Salt Lake City , UT ) , cell phone use measure cellular provider report Break Free mobile application ( Mobifolio ) . Blood draw perform intervention 3-month follow-up . Body composition assess dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . Hypotheses Specific Aims . Primary Aim . Conduct two-arm parallel group randomize control trial relative effect intervention adolescent sleep duration medium use adolescent ' sleep duration quality , insulin sensitivity , appetite-regulating hormone body composition . At end study 3-month follow-up , adolescent sleep intervention group compare control group : H1 : Increased sleep duration sleep quality H2 : Increased insulin sensitivity H3 : Decreased ghrelin H4 : Decreased percent body fat H5 : Associations sleep duration quality insulin sensitivity , ghrelin percent body fat Secondary Aim . Evaluate whether sleep intervention affect adolescent ' nighttime medium use . H1 : Adolescents sleep intervention group decrease nighttime medium use ( cell phone , internet television ) compare control group end study 3-month follow-up . Future . Results preliminary study shed light impact sleep medium use intervention adolescent reduce obesity risk type 2 diabetes adolescent . These data provide support future R01 submission test effectiveness sleep intervention context large , well-powered study . It also provide foundation test mechanisms action relationship sleep obesity type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
