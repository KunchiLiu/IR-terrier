	<brief_summary>Bipolar disorder ( BPD ) often misdiagnosed unipolar depression . This lead inadequate treatment negative impact course disease . There preliminary evidence patient unipolar bipolar depression well healthy individual heighten risk BPD distinguish base brain activity pattern functional connectivity rest state . However , impact pharmacological treatment functional brain measure yet clarify . For common antidepressant show seem normalise aberrant brain activity pattern functional connectivity . The problem antidepressant induce mania accelerate pathological cycling depressive patient unrecognised BPD . Therefore , pharmacological drug mood-stabilising property quetiapine prescribe . Although effectiveness tolerability proven , neuronal effect adjunctive treatment clear . The aim study thus investigate impact quetiapine measure brain activity depressive patient heighten risk BPD . Moreover , investigator want examine whether investigator distinguish depressive patient heighten risk BPD depressive patient without heighten risk BPD use neuroimaging technique , whether measure predict course disease .</brief_summary>
