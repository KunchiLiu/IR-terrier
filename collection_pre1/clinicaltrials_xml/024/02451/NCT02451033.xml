	<brief_summary>Cirrhosis liver lead cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Complications include ascites , spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) , variceal bleed , hepatic encephalopathy , hepatorenal syndrome ( HRS ) development hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) poor prognosis decrease survival patient . It believe cirrhosis irreversible treatment focus prevent progression liver fibrosis/dysfunction complication . Currently effective treatment liver transplantation , increasingly limited expensive resource especially develop country . Furthermore , transplantation come requirement lifelong immunosuppression , considerable long-term side effect include chronic renal failure , post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease , cardiovascular complication . Short liver transplant , recently , report unexpected plasticity adult bone marrow raise hope stem cell therapy may offer excite therapeutic possibility patient end stage liver diseases . It show response acute chronic liver damage , bone marrow derive stem cell spontaneously populate liver differentiate hepatic cell . Animal human study suggest cell might contribute regeneration different kind liver injury . In animal model , liver injury , bone marrow-derived circulating pluripotent cell report participate liver repopulation non-parenchymal cell hepatocytes . This repopulation process , however , seem highly dependent type liver injury experimental condition . Fusion hematopoietic cell substantiate mechanism hepatocytes regenerate , study demonstrate improved liver histology survival patient cirrhosis follow mobilization bone marrow stem cell granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) . Three recent study demonstrate G-CSF induced mobilization bone marrow stem cell ( CD34 cell ) peripheral blood subsequent increase liver tissue improve survival patient alcoholic hepatitis acute chronic liver failure ( ACLF ) . However insufficient data whether G-CSF improves survival prognosis patient cirrhosis . Also , Malnutrition commonly see ( 60-70 % ) cirrhotics adverse prognosis outcome . The protein catabolic state cirrhosis associate severe growth hormone ( GH ) resistance , low level insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -I major bind protein ( IGFBP ) -3 . GH therapy cirrhosis show improve nitrogen economy improve GH resistance small pilot study . Also , GH therapy short duration show increase IGF1 level , IGFBP-3 level patient cirrhosis . GH therapy also show improve liver regeneration protein synthesis hepatectomy patient HCC cirrhosis . However scarcity data clinical impact long term administration GH therapy patient cirrhosis .</brief_summary>
