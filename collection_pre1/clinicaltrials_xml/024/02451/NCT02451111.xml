	<brief_title>Rituximab With Without Ibrutinib Patients With Advanced Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Follicular lymphoma FL traditionally approach either initial watch wait policy asymptomatic patient , single agent treatment purpose maintain good quality life prolong time . During last decade , treatment strategy change due continuous development introduction novel therapeutic approach ( include immunotherapy interferon-alpha monoclonal antibody , combination immunotherapy chemotherapy , radioimmunotherapy radiolabeled monoclonal antibody ) . For asymptomatic patient advanced-stage , low tumor burden , randomized study confirm systemic treatment defer development symptom organ failure ( generally occur within 2-3 year diagnosis ) without overall survival impairment watchful waiting policy long remain widely accept approach . For symptomatic patient advanced tumor burden , need initial treatment , combination rituximab chemotherapy , possibly follow rituximab maintenance become new standard many country . In set chemotherapy-free strategy , clinical study rituximab combination immunotherapy novel target agent obvious relevant . Promising result also report combination rituximab lenalidomide . The combination rituximab ibrutinib test clinical trial appear well tolerate active . Since ibrutinib seem achieve good result administer prolonged time show CLL , investigator choose compare combination rituximab prolong rituximab-only schedule already show active SAKK 35/03 trial . SAKK long tradition treatment FL patient chemotherapy-free treatment base rituximab . This worldwide special situation , create cooperation important partner clinical trial area . The aim study investigate efficacy , safety tolerability treatment combination Ibrutinib Rituximab patient advance follicular lymphoma need therapy .</detailed_description>
