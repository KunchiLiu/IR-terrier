	<brief_summary>Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy ( LITT ) minimally invasive surgical technique allow biopsy thermal ablation brain tumor . Pediatric patient brain tumor eligible enroll trial undergo LITT time diagnosis time recurrence/progression rather undergo open craniotomy tumor resection/biopsy . LITT include stereotactic biopsy follow thermal ablation tumor . This study monitor safety efficacy LITT treatment pediatric brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy ( LITT ) Treatment Pediatric Central Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric brain tumor variety surgical option depend location type tumor . Complete near complete surgical removal pediatric brain tumor usually result best chance survival long-term control tumor . Surgical resection open craniotomy common surgical treatment accessible brain tumor . For tumor surgically accessible resistant surgical intervention , treatment limited radiation chemotherapy , significant long term toxicity child . Laser interstitial thermal therapy ( LITT ) offer minimally invasive surgical option treat central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor . LITT use laser energy deliver target ( i.e . CNS tumor ) fiberoptic catheter , result damage intracellular protein DNA , subsequent cell death . LITT provide sharp demarcation ablate unharmed tissue , , combine ability monitor control ablation via MR thermal imaging , result high level precision control . LITT may offer treatment option patient deep brain lesion surgically inaccessible , tumor locate thalamus , hypothalamus , basal ganglia brainstem . LITT may also potential treatment brain tumor recur persist despite conventional therapy include craniotomy . The MRI-guided laser probe use LITT utilizes much small surgical corridor brain reach deep lesion , potentially reduce risk complication . This study offer LITT , rather open craniotomy , diagnosis treatment newly diagnose pediatric brain tumor locate difficult surgically access region brain treatment recurrent/resistant pediatric brain tumor locate anywhere within brain . The primary aim study determine LITT effective reducing ( least maintain current rate ) tumor re-growth lowering rate post-surgical complication improve quality procedure ( i.e . short hospitalization less use pain medication compare standard surgery tumor removal/biopsy ) . This study follow goal : 1 . Determine frequency post-operative side-effects pediatric patient newly diagnose , difficult surgically access CNS tumor resistant/recurrent CNS tumor location receive LITT treatment tumor ablation . 2 . Examine role LITT control newly diagnose difficult surgically access CNS tumor resistant/recurrent pediatric CNS tumor location . 3 . Assess correlation extent tumor ablation rate local tumor control . 4 . Characterize MRI change occur pediatric tumor follow LITT ablation . Patients enrol study require routine post-LITT follow-up , include intermittent physical exam assess side effect MRIs monitor status tumor . The follow-up similar perform follow open craniotomy involve extra study . The side effect rate tumor control brain tumor patient enrol trial compare disease match historical control learn morbidity efficacy LITT population patient compare patient underwent open craniotomy resection/biopsy .</detailed_description>
