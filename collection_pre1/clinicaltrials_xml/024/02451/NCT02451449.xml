	<detailed_description>Aims study : - To investigate prevalence CD cohort men woman refer fertility treatment Danish fertility clinic - To compare individual diagnosed CD individual without disease investigate : - possible predictive symptom CD ( fertility history , gastrointestinal symptom , co-morbidity ) - semen quality among men - To investigate effect gluten free diet semen quality ( DNA fragmentation ) men diagnose CD 3 month treatment gluten free diet - To investigate correlation sCD163 histological change small-bowel - To investigate correlation level sCD163 level macrophage biopsies - To evaluate performance rapid point-of-care serologic CD screen test population men woman refer fertility treatment Hypothesises study : - CD increase risk infertility men woman - Predictive symptom CD identify use select future risk-groups - Untreated CD men negative effect semen quality semen quality improve treatment gluten free diet - Level sCD 163 correlate degree inflammatory lesion small-bowel - Level sCD163 correlate level macrophages mucose-tissue small-bowel - The rapid point-of-care test efficient tool CD case find adult population Methods material : A cross-sectional study measure prevalence Celiac disease population couple ( men woman ) refer treatment Danish fertility clinic . Analysis data study questionnaire , serological test , semen specimens small-bowel biopsy perform one year follow-up fertility treatment outcome participant . Recruitment : A realistic sample size recruit 2 year 600 woman 600 men ( 600 heterosexual couple ) newly refer two Danish public fertility clinic . Both male female part ask participate attend clinic pre-assessment . Patients prior biopsy confirm CD screen , count prevalence result . Questionnaires : After give informed consent patient ask answer questionnaire gastrointestinal function ( The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale , GSRS ( 26 ) ) , fertility history co-morbidity ( appendix I ) . The GSRS questionnaire validate , self-administered questionnaire include 15 question , assess severity gastrointestinal symptom use 7-point Likert scale five domain : indigestion , diarrhoea , constipation , abdominal pain reflux . The severity symptom report GSRS increase increase score . Serological test : After answer questionnaire blood sample drawn send laboratory analyse IgA Antitissue Transglutaminase ( IgA TG ) , total IgA IgG Deamidated Gliadin Peptid ( DGP ) IgA deficit sCD163 . At time vitro rapid screen test CD perform ( Simtomax® ) . Simtomax® indicate CD IgA deficiency ( base Deamidated Gliadin Peptid total IgA ) . The cut value CD positive test referral gastroscopy small- bowl biopsy IgA TG &gt; 7 kU/L Simtomax® test result `` celiac positive IgA normal '' `` celiac positive IgA deficient '' together clinical symptom ( questionnaire ) . For Total IgA cut value &lt; 0,80 g/L . Simtomax® high negative predict value ( &gt; 90 % ) CD . The cut value IgG DGP &gt; 3 KU/L . One CD positive test enough referral small-bowel biopsy . Level sCD163 measure level sCD163 consequence referral diagnose CD . All serological test send Department Biochemistry Horsens Hospital , responsible handle serological test study . Serological material destroy immediately analysis . Follow-up algorithm serological test : - Patients , test negative CD IgA TG , IgG DGP Simtomax® , telephone consultation fertility clinic , inform study nurse doctor result . Results available within 5 day . The patient continue fertility treatment plan . - If IgA TG IgG DGP ( Simtomax® clinical symptom ) exceed cut value , indicate CD , patient contact investigator informed result invited consultation gastroscopy responsible specialist doctor Department Endoscopy , Horsens Hospital . The patient receive verbal write information preparation gastroscopy risk complication procedure small-bowel biopsy . The biopsy material send pathology analysis determine histology classification ( Marsh-classification ) . Small-bowel biopsy : Biopsies take small-bowel ( duodenum duodenal bulb 5-6 biopsy ) . The classic pathology change CD small-bowel categorise `` Modified Marsh criterion '' determine histological change : - Marsh stage 0 : normal duodenal mucosa - Marsh stage 1 : increase number intra-epithelial lymphocyte ( IELs ) , usually exceed 25 per 100 enterocytes - Marsh stage 2 : Stage 1 + crypt hyperplasia - Marsh stage 3 ( , b , c ) : Increased IELs , crypt hyperplasia partial , subtotal total villous atrophy A Marsh stage 3 ( , b , c ) classic lesion CD confirms diagnose CD . Stage 1 2 indicate milder lesion small-bowel , indicate CD . A Marsh 0 positive serology rare may indicate latent CD . Patients Marsh 0 classified biopsy classify CD . Patients 1-3 ( , b , c ) classify biopsy elevate IgA TG IgG DGP study consider CD ( 27 ) . Levels sCD163 compare Marsh stage determine level sCD 163 correlate inflammatory lesion small-bowel . Biopsies , determination Marsh stage , undergo color identify macrophage . Biopsies destroy study end . Follow-up algorithm biopsy : The patient inform pathology answer telephone responsible specialist doctor offer follow-up accord algorithm : - Patients positive serology negative biopsy offer consultation specialist doctor Horsens Hospital . - Patients biopsy confirm CD offer consultation specialist doctor dietary counselling hospital dietician Horsens Hospital - Patients biopsy confirm CD offer new consultation fertility clinic planning fertility treatment ( recommended strict gluten free diet least three month fertility treatment take place ( male female patient ) . - Patients biopsy confirm CD offer three month follow-up specialist doctor Horsens Hospital . Here patient ask answer second part questionnaire , new serological test ( IgA TG , IgG DGP , sCD163 ) male patient deliver new semen specimen . Semen specimen : All male patient routine procedure deliver semen specimens semen quality analysis ( base motility , morphology , semen concentration ) consultation fertility clinic . This study use result routine semen quality analysis male participant . Men biopsy confirm CD ask collect semen specimen start gluten free diet collect semen specimen 3 month gluten free diet . These semen specimens frozen test chromatin fragmentation . The semen quality measure degree chromatin fragmentation within sperm cell use Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay ( SCSA ) . Semen quality express DNA fragmentation index , express percent damage sperm . The gluten free diet DNA fragmentation index compare . Biobank future research : This study contain biobank . Patients ask give separate inform consent store blood material biobank future research . If consent , one extra glass 10 ml full blood drawn inclusion , patient diagnose CD also one extra glass 10 ml 3 month follow-up . The Danish Data Protection Agency give permission establish biobank . The biobank future research material use new permission regional committee health research ethic . Statistics power calculation : All data analyse use STATA 13.To calculate sample size formula n= Z2P ( 1-P ) /d2 ( 24 ) use : With confidence interval ( CI ) 95 % ( Z=1.96 ) , precision 1 % ( d=0.01 ) expect prevalence woman 2,5 % ( P=0.025 ) , minimum sample size require 600 woman . For men P=0.01 d=0.005 sample size =1521 CI 95 % . With expect prevalence couple : ( 1- ( 0.975*0.99 ) ) = 3.5 % d=0.0175 , CI 95 % , sample size = 420 couple . Ethical consideration : Participants include study could benefit directly study undiagnosed CD . It evident untreated CD woman negative consequence pregnancy . The risk draw blood minimal . If blood test indicate CD risk actually CD 50 % . Undergoing small-bowel biopsy unpleasant painful . It standard procedure . Participants informed risk consent . Clinical advisor , senior consultant gastroenterology Thomas Møller Jensen , Horsens Hospital responsible medical clinical management follow-up patient detect CD positive serological test . The approval Regional Committee Health Research Ethics , Central Denmark The Danish Data Protection Agency obtain study start . The study carry accordance Helsinki II declaration oral write informed consent obtain patient participate . Consent store blood biobank future research give separately . The processing data accordance Danish regulation . All information keep confidentially lock fertility clinic data collect investigator kept lock ( double lock ) Department Horsens Hospital . At end study identifiable personal data conceal code accessible investigator also responsible biobank . Funding : Department Medicine , Horsens Hospital take initiative study . There economical incentive relate study project participant . The Simtomax® vitro test fund pharmaceutical company Tillotts Pharma ( 1200 test ) . The agreement authorize The Technology Transfer Office Aarhus University . A deficit guarantee salary investigator Louise Grode give Horsens Hospital study start . All cost seek funded private public funding . A research account administer Horsens Hospital hold funding relate study . No payment give patient participate study .</detailed_description>
