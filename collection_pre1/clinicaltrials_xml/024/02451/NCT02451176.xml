	<brief_summary>This study compare safety , efficacy cost effectiveness permanent synthetic mesh versus biologic prosthesis repair ventral hernia set clean-contaminated ( Class 2 ) contaminate ( Class 3 ) surgical procedure . The finding study major impact field hernia surgery provide objective guide mesh selection , optimize surgical approach complex ventral hernia repair , ultimately significantly improve patient outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biologic Mesh Versus Synthetic Mesh Repair Ventral Hernias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter prospective double-blinded randomize control trial compare 253 patient clean-contaminated ( Class 2 ) contaminate ( Class3 ) abdominal wall ventral hernia undergo single stag repair . Soft Mesh CR Bard , macroporous monofilament polypropylene permanent mesh compare Strattice mesh Lifecell , non-cross link porcine dermal biologic graft single stage open reconstruction clean-contaminated contaminate abdominal wall defect . The primary outcome variable absence surgical site occurence require procedural intervention absence hernia recurrence time surgery 24 month postoperative follow . Patients undergo open ventral hernia repair clean-contamination contaminate abdominal wall hernia meeting inclusion criterion randomize receive synthetic mesh biologic mesh . Randomization carry use computer-generated randomization block time enrollment . Stratified randomize use strata formulate medical center clean-contaminated contaminated surgical site class . The Investigator blind patient randomization assignment point intra-operative device use follow final CDC wound classification , whereas patient co-investigators responsible data analysis remain blinded patient randomization conclusion study period . As , double-blinded study protocol maintain . Patients randomize synthetic mesh receive SoftMesh™ ( CR Bard , Murray Hill , NJ ) patient randomize biologic mesh receive Strattice™ ( Lifecell , Branchburg NJ ) . The use biologic synthetic mesh contaminate field consider experimental however selection prosthetics base careful review multiple animal model , preclinical data , clinical experience material place clean contaminate abdominal wall reconstruction . Surgical wound classify base CDC ( Centers Disease Control ) criteria Class 2 3 wound include study . Postoperatively patient evaluate sign symptoms complication along presence absence Surgical Site Infections per CDC guideline , presence absence surgical site occurrence ( SSOs ) procedural intervention require treat SSOs , presence absence hernia recurrence reoperations , length hospital stay , discharge date , time return bowel function readmission . Active participation study last 24 month involve one preoperative evaluation visit , one operative procedure visit , 4 follow visit . Participants complete two brief survey questionnaires regard quality life , activity pain . The second outcome demonstrate macroporous light-weight polypropylene mesh cost effective strategy biologic prosthetic clean-contaminated contaminate abdominal wall reconstruction</detailed_description>
