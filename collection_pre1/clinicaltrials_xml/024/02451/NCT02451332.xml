	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Preventing poor perinatal outcome goal prenatal care , yet go develop preeclampsia growth-restricted baby notoriously difficult predict . A grow body evidence suggest inflammatory marker help predict poor outcome , even prior , beyond , current pregnancy . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) manufacture liver response immune provocation , help activate complement system . Because easily assay via phlebotomy less invasive capillary blood spot collection , favour marker study inflammation field diverse immunology , obstetrics gynecology , primary care , anthropology , epidemiology . Pregnancy pro-inflammatory state , reproductive physiology study show CRP higher pregnant woman age-matched non-pregnant woman , high still viable pregnancy spontaneous abortion ectopic pregnancy . But look ecology CRP variation show trend clinical relevance . CRP high obese pregnant woman leaner counterpart , positively correlate body fat , waist-hip ratio , HDL . While CRP appear relate insulin sensitivity non-diabetic pregnant woman , pregnant woman type I diabetes mellitus , CRP positively correlate high HgBA1C progression retinopathy . CRP rise prenatal iron therapy , labour , post-partum period . It high woman Cesarean section woman deliver vaginally . And physiologic state variable associate CRP variation . In study 52 woman Denver , Colorado , high CRP associate high second-trimester life stress score low third-trimester social support score . In study 775 woman North Carolina , high CRP associate self-reported black race , qualify food stamp , lack private insurance , unmarried , previous preterm birth , maternal weight . Does elevate inflammatory marker also correspond maternal fetal morbidity ? Most research suggest . While one study 32 Finnish woman show difference CRP premature prelabour rupture membrane ( PPROM ) gestational age-matched control , one study pregnant teens New York show CRP associate neither gestational age birth birth weight , study woman USA , Ecuador , Colombia , Netherlands , Hungary , Turkey , India , South Korea show high third-trimester CRP associate increase risk preeclampsia , intrauterine growth restriction , preterm delivery . It also appear elevated inflammatory marker may associate long-term maternal infant morbidity . When CRP test prospective cohort post-partum woman underwent diabetes screen 3 month 12 month post-partum , woman develop diabetes high CRP 3 month . And Spain , high maternal CRP first trimester associate great risk infant wheeze respiratory tract infection 14 month ( control sex , birth weight , prematurity , maternal smoking alcohol consumption , parity , maternal pre-pregnancy BMI , maternal total IgE , daycare attendance , breastfeed . So data prognostic value CRP pregnancy accumulate decade , variable widely investigated clinical obstetrics practice . Furthermore , research focus static measure CRP , woman 's dynamic response immune challenge pregnancy myriad ethical concern clinical trial involve pregnant woman : possible woman 's inflammatory response challenge clinically relevant baseline CRP level . RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The investigator propose answer research gap measure CRP response control provocation part standard prenatal care Canada ( influenza vaccination ) , follow result delivery . Specifically , investigator wish answer follow question : 1 . What variation CRP value cohort pregnant woman low risk obstetrical complication Calgary , Alberta ? 2 . How CRP respond standard immune provocation pregnancy ? 3 . Does response vary age mother , ethnicity , gestational age , parity , BMI prior pregnancy , weight gain pregnancy ? 4 . Does response vary risk gestational hypertension , preeclampsia , preterm delivery , birth weight ? METHODS This quantitative prospective cohort study . Recruitment : At begin 2015 flu season , investigator recruit participant low-risk prenatal clinic serve South Health Campus Calgary , Alberta , seasonal influenza vaccine suggest part routine prenatal care , Dr. Kidd work . When woman check appointment , give flyer inform study . Women wish participate study ask present dedicate clinic room prenatal appointment , Dr. Kidd obtain informed consent , well patient 's name Alberta Health Care Number purpose data retrieval . Using standard protocol physician collect capillary whole blood spot sample Whatman # 903 filter paper follow finger stick , assign anonymous code , e.g . 001-0 . Dr. Kidd clinic nurse administer flu vaccine . On day 3 , research assistant obtain second capillary blood spot sample , participant 's home , convenient location . The anonymous code use , e.g . 001-3 . Both set blood spot sample , xxx-0 xxx-3 , send Laboratory Human Biology Research Northwestern University , analysis direction Dr. McDade ; lab personnel access participant information . Eight month later ( participant ' pregnancy complete ) , prenatal record complete delivery information obtain electronic medical record clinic . Prenatal record provide independent variable ( ethnicity , gestational age , parity , BMI prior pregnancy , weight gain pregnancy ) dependent variable ( systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , gestational age delivery , method delivery , birth weight ) . Any proteinuria result obtain provincial EMR , Netcare . Once datasets complete , participant ' information de-identified . CRP result add dataset additional dependent variable . The investigator convenience sample 100 woman pre- post-vaccination blood spot . Laboratory analysis : The investigator analyze blood sample CRP ( mg/L ) use improve version high sensitivity ELISA protocol develop specifically dry blood spot ( DBS ) sample . Prior validation assay performance indicate method excellent sensitivity , precision , reliability , high correlation match plasma DBS sample across entire assay range ( Pearson R=0.96 ) . For analysis investigator apply standard laboratory quality control procedure , include run sample duplicate , inspect calibration curve fit day-to-day variation , measure quality control sample assay . DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS All data keep confidential stored secure location Department Family Medicine University Calgary . Electronic data password-protected . Only Dr. Kidd access participant medical record , research team access data . The distribution CRP value likely skewed baseline day 3 , value therefore log transform ( base 10 ) normalize distribution . However , descriptive analysis statistical test implement use untransformed well transformed result confirm similar pattern result . Non-parametric test difference median implement use Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks rank sum test , Spearman rank-order correlation use assess strength association . Log-transformed result subject paired test , Pearson correlation , ordinary least square regression analysis . Descriptive statistic use characterize baseline concentration CRP , CRP response vaccination , relation prior research . Bivariate analyse investigate association CRP/CRP response follow independent variable : maternal age , ethnicity , BMI prior pregnancy , weight gain pregnancy , gestational age , parity . Bivariate analysis also investigate association CRP/CRP response pregnancy complication birth outcome , include : systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , proteinuria , gestational age delivery , birth weight . Multivariate regression analysis investigate association maternal factor CRP/CRP response , independent potential confounding influence . Similarly , regression analysis investigate CRP/CRP response independent predictor birth outcome . Limitations study include relatively small sample size , although prior research area drawn conclusion small sample . An additional limitation potential loss follow-up two juncture : woman may available research assistant obtain DBS day 3 , woman 's prenatal care transfer obstetrician complication arise therefore complete record available research team . If seem much attrition happen day 3 , investigator begin ask woman collect DBS disposable lancet investigator provide . The investigator able control woman transfer obstetrics , though Dr. Kidd 's experience clinic happen less 20 per cent woman initially consider low-risk complication . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The researcher conflict interest disclose . Health risk participant limit minimal risk associate routine vaccination , example pain , redness swell injection site low-grade fever . More serious risk include allergic reaction vaccine ( dyspnea , hive , hypotension ) , Guillain-Barré syndrome , rare ascend paralysis affect approximately 1 1 million flu vaccine recipient . Risks maternal fetal complication influenza think far exceed risk potential flu vaccine reaction . Risks blood spot collection limit discomfort associate finger prick . Participants ' information de-identified participant identify name presentation publication study finding . RELEVANCE This work important public health implication may help u good predict prevent poor perinatal outcome . For example , woman high CRP value , high CRP response , might benefit close fetal surveillance , might need go medical leave earlier pregnancy — guideline currently available help clinical decision . Going forward , new research continue show baseline pregnancy level CRP correlate pre-pregnancy level , awareness inflammatory marker prenatal care may help u identify pre-pregnancy condition may lead poor perinatal outcome , social inequity adversity . Perhaps CRP might one day use monitor `` readiness '' woman contemplate pregnancy , much way pre-pregnancy BMI help predict risk complication . DISSEMINATION OF FINDINGS Selected finding present appropriate venue include conference , academic seminar publication biomedical science anthropology . Our study take place 9 month , begin October , 2015 . TEAM Dr. Monica Kidd family physician low-risk obstetrics provider Calgary , Alberta . She background evolutionary biology research interest include child maternal health . Dr. Thomas McDade biological anthropologist specialize human biology . His research focus cause consequence variation inflammation community-based setting . He director Laboratory Human Biology Research , promote use dry blood spot sample minimally-invasive alternative venipuncture .</detailed_description>
