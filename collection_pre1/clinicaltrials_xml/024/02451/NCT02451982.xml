	<brief_summary>This study look whether CY/GVAX nivolumab effective CY/GVAX alone alter pancreatic tumor microenvironment ( IL17 expression ) aid anti-tumor response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant/Adjuvant GVAX Pancreas Vaccine ( With CY ) With Without Nivolumab Trial Surgically Resectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunotherapy innovative approach develop treatment pancreatic cancer , lethal relatively chemotherapy-resistant disease . However , tumor environment develop number way inhibit function immune system prevent recognize kill cancer . In addition , investigator still understand T cell , cell immune system potential recognize cancer different kill cancer cell , traffic tumor accomplish task . The investigator currently test immune system activate pancreatic cancer vaccine ( know GVAX ) combination immune boosting dos chemotherapy agent , cyclophosphamide , preoperative postoperative treatment pancreatic cancer . The investigator discover tertiary lymphoid aggregate , unique lymph node-like structure form within resected tumor patient receive vaccine two week prior surgery . This discovery demonstrate immune system get tumor provide investigator opportunity well understand immune cell traffic tumor function arrive . The investigator also find vaccine cause increase signal would suppress immune system 's ability fight cancer cell , include signal involve PD-1 . In novel study , investigator test effect block PD-1 combination vaccine patient pancreatic cancer . The investigator specifically isolate immune cell evaluate genetic protein level , type signal express aggregate . The investigator compare aggregate patient long term survival versus patient succumb cancer early . In way , investigator able determine safe novel treatment , effective change immune system pancreatic cancer , impact health survival pancreatic cancer patient undergo surgery remove cancer .</detailed_description>
