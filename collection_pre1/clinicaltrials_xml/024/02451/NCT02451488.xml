	<detailed_description>The sentinel lymph node patient melanoma immunosuppressed investigator show occurs early disease process . This regional nodal immunosuppression precedes nodal metastasis may require nodal spread . Administration GM-CSF use alter immune response metastatic melanoma . The investigator propose ass whether administration short course GM-CSF preoperatively patient undergo wide local excision sentinel lymph node dissection alter immune environment sentinel lymph node restore immune surveillance profile sentinel lymph node .</detailed_description>
