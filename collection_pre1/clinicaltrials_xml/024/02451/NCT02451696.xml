	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure drug call Everolimus effect mTOR signal ( electrical activity signal brain ) patient Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC ) Focal Cortical Dysplasia ( FCD ) treatment resistant epilepsy ( TRE ) undergo brain surgery . One group patient treat Everolimus , another . Researchers determine difference mTOR signal patient treat Everolimus . Previous study suggest Everolimus may reduce seizure activity TSC patient decrease mTOR signaling . Since patient FCD may also excess mTOR signal brain activity , Everolimus may also reduce seizure activity patient . The drug Everolimus approve Food Drug Administration treat specific type breast , pancreatic , kidney cancer , kidney tumor call angiomyolipoma ( common patient TSC ) , TSC patient brain tumor call subependymal giant cell astrocytoma ( SEGA ) . However , research consider investigational since approve reduction mTOR signal decrease seizure frequency . Researchers believe Everolimus may useful reduce something call cortical hyperexcitability , excess brain activity contribute seizure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study To Evaluate The Effects Everolimus Brain mTOR Activity Cortical Hyperexcitability TSC FCD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center open-label pilot clinical trial patient TRE , age 1 40 year old , TSC FCD schedule epilepsy surgery . Patients treat everolimus 7 28 day prior epilepsy surgery extension time 7 28 day successive cohort patient . The initial cohort least three patient treat 7 day safety therapy assure group , extension treatment 14 day least three patient . This extend one week intervals/three patient group maximum treatment duration 28 day . Resected brain tissue analyze activation mTORC1 mTORC2 signal pathway , glutamatergic GABA-ergic neurotransmission use histochemistry , genetic analysis , well extracellular field recording acute ex-vivo brain slice surgery . A blood sample , collect time surgery , analyze everolimus level VEGF-D. All patient undergo standardized intra-operative ECoG recording primary epileptogenic region review blindly . Subjects study 7-28 day . The investigator study variable list specific aim 1 2 TSC FCD patient treat 7 28 day everolimus compare untreated control patient TRE TSC FCD . A concurrent comparison group 12 subject also enrol . They undergo routine surgery diagnosis TRE TSC FCD . All study procedure perform Comprehensive Epilepsy Center ( CEC ) exception surgery , perform Tisch Hospital .</detailed_description>
