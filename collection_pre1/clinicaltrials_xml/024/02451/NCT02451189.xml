	<brief_summary>Obesity , associate co-morbidities , major public health challenge . It estimate 2050 , 60 % men 50 % woman clinically obese . Obesity associate increase risk develop diabetes , cardiovascular disease , certain cancer . The increase epidemic obesity necessitate study complex mechanism underlie energy homeostasis . Food intake , energy balance body weight tightly regulate hypothalamus , brainstem reward circuit , basis cognitive input diverse humoral neuronal signal nutritional status . Several gut hormone , include glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) peptide YY3-36 ( PYY ) , show play important role regulate short-term food intake . Peripheral administration PYY GLP-1 enhances satiety reduces food intake animal man . PYY , GLP-1 along host hormone produce gut response nutrient availability different region gut provide exquisite mechanism nutrient sense response dietary intake . These hormone therefore represent potential target development novel anti-obesity treatment . A novel attractive strategy induce appetite regulation enrichment food component stimulate release GLP-1 PYY . The short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) produce microbial fermentation dietary fibre colon show stimulate release PYY GLP-1 rodent enteroendocrine L cell , via stimulation G-protein couple free fatty acid receptor ( FFAR ) colonic L cell . However , know whether three SCFA , acetate , butyrate propionate , differentially affect appetite glucose control . The aim study compare effect increase colonic delivery acetate , butyrate propionate appetite glucose control overweight men randomise crossover study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The role SCFA appetite regulation : SCFA show stimulate PYY GLP-1 production animal model dietary fibre , SCFA major end product , induce appetite regulation human . However evidence underpinning dietary fibre induce appetite regulation human weak difficulty control study high fibre intake . In recent project fund BBSRC DRINC initiative ( BB/H004815/1 ) , investigator first direct evidence SCFA directly regulate appetite human . Prior study , order achieve production SCFA level , high enough induce appetite-regulating effect , large amount dietary fibre ( &gt; 25 g/d 40 g/d ) require , compliance high fibre diet poor due gastrointestinal side effect . Furthermore , supplement diet mixed high fibre predictably reliably increase colonic SCFA production circulating level SCFA human population variability gut microbial activity . Finally , orally administer SCFAs palatable rapidly absorb small intestine L cell sparse . In study date focus SCFA propionate high affinity receptor end product metabolism microbiota therefore seem obvious target manipulate investigate effect SCFA appetite regulation . To overcome unpalatably high level fermentable dietary fibre need significantly increase colonic propionate level , unpredictability production result SCFAs , investigator develop test novel delivery system target release gram quantity propionate proximal colon . It estimate delivery system may lead 2-8 fold increase colonic propionate , level difficult achieve feed mixed fermentable fibre diet . This level propionate production might observe ancestral diet part rural Africa dietary fibre intake high . Previous work , conduct investigator , also demonstrate delivery system increase plasma propionate level , reduces food intake acute study appetite , long term study ( 24 week ) , positive effect food intake , body composition , glucose homeostasis , circulate lipid , cholesterol liver function , liver visceral fat weight management observe . However , present know acetate , propionate butyrate exert similar effect appetite glucose metabolism . Therefore study wish compare effect target delivery acetate , propionate butyrate proximal colon appetite glucose homeostasis overweight men .</detailed_description>
