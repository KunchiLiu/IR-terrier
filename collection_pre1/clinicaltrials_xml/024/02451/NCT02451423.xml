	<brief_summary>This single arm , open label Phase II study MPDL3280A , anti-PD-L1 antibody administer neoadjuvant therapy subject either BCG-refractory non-muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) bladder , muscle-invasive TCC appropriate cystectomy refuse ineligible neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Enrolled patient assign sequentially dose level cohort 6 patient per dose level . The start dose level 1200mg x 1 dose escalate subsequent cohort 1200mg q 3 week x 2 dos , finally 1200mg q 3 week x 3 dos determine impact increase number treatment modulate immune response tumor tissue . Subjects adverse pathology ( pT3/pT4 N+ ) offer option adjuvant MPDL3280A 16 cumulative cycle treatment . After neoadjuvant study therapy administer , subject undergo cystectomy evaluate pathologic response treatment immunologic characterization resect tissue . Serum urine obtain well characterize circulate immune response . After multi-dose portion study complete accrual two expansion cohort 15 patient NMIBC MIBC accrue high dose level characterization safety , efficacy , immunologic analysis . Patients pT3 , pT4 , N+ disease time cystectomy metastatic disease offer option adjuvant MPDL3280A total 16 cumulative cycle . All subject follow clinically 2 year assess disease recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 year age old ECOG performance status 0 , 1 Histologically document transitional cell carcinoma presence follow stage : CIS , highgrade Ta , grade T1 , grade cT2T4 , consider appropriate radical cystectomy . Subjects mixed histology require dominant TCC pattern . For subject NMIBC , BCGrefractory BCGresistant disease . BCGrefractory disease define absence complete response 6 month patient receive induction maintenance OR two induction course BCG . BCGresistant disease define persistent recurrent disease 2 induction course BCG within 1 year OR cancer recurrence within 1 year initiation therapy patient receive induction plus maintenance BCG therapy . Subjects NMIBC must suitable willing undergo radical cystectomy completion study therapy . For subject muscle invasive disease : suitable neoadjuvant cisplatinbased chemotherapy determine follow : Creatinine clearance less 60ml/min . GFR assess calculation serum/plasma creatinine ( CockcroftGault formula ) CTCAE Gr &gt; /= 2 hearing loss CTCAE Gr &gt; /= 2 neuropathy Subjects MIBC meeting criterion still eligible provide patient decline neoadjuvant cisplatinbased chemotherapy , specific informed consent describe know benefit cisplatinbased chemotherapy . The reason decline must document . Adequate bone marrow function define WBC &gt; 2500 cells/mm3 ANC &gt; 1500 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL . Patients may transfuse receive erythropoietic treatment meet criterion . Platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Adequate renal function : Serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL OR calculate CrCl &gt; 30ml/min Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN ( except patient document Gilbert 's disease ) AST ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . Have available evaluable archival tumor tissue PDL1 biomarker assessment . Presence PDL1 antigen tumor NOT require study entry . The effect MPDL3280A develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry , study participation , 90 day study treatment discontinuation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 90 day completion study drug administration . Subjects primary TCC ureter , urethra , renal pelvis without TCC bladder allow . Known distant metastatic disease ( e.g . pulmonary hepatic metastasis ) .
