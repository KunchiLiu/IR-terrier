	<brief_title>Evaluation Pressure Distribution Kyboot Shoes Comparison Other Foot Wear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every 30 second limb lose somewhere world consequence diabetes . These amputation precede foot ulcer 84 % case . Therefore , prevention ulceration utmost importance . Approximately one-half diabetic foot ulcer occur plantar foot surface mainly cause elevated level mechanical pressure act foot ambulation presence lose protective foot sensation peripheral neuropathy . Therefore , reduce risk ulceration , relief mechanical pressure ( also call offloading ) indicate . Currently therapeutic footwear provide Health maintenance organization ( HMO 's ) diabetic patient risk develop foot ulcer . Ideal footwear diabetic patient decrease weight-bearing pressure shear force apply skin foot distribute act force evenly . With growth health fitness industry , sport footwear show technological advance diversification . The introduction KyBoot shoe example diversification . The Kybun company base shoe experience walk soft , muddy rice field Korea . The Kyboot construction base soft , supple air cushion sole . The honeycomb air structure kyBoot sole create air cushion foot ground , one fifth volume air pump foot area every step . This design could offer good distribution pressure . Therefore , study would like compare pressure distribution , change movement center pressure shock absorb capability KyBoot comparison normal shoe . Study goal : Comparison evaluation pressure distribution , gait pattern , change movement center pressure , shock absorb capability comfort wear use KyBoot shoe versus normal foot wear diabetic healthy subject .</detailed_description>
