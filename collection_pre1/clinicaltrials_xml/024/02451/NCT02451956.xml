	<brief_summary>This study single arm , single center phase II study AZD5363 combination paclitaxel patient advance gastric adenocarcinoma harbor PIK3CA mutation amplification second line chemotherapy . Patients receive AZD 5363 plus weekly paclitaxel combination regimen . A arm compose 25 patient . Tumour evaluation use RECIST 1.1 conduct screening ( within 28 day prior first dose ) every 8 week relative date enrollment , week 40 , every 16 week objective disease progression ( within window +/- 7 day schedule date ) . Study treatment continue objective disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study AZD5363 Combination With Paclitaxel , Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma Patients Harboring PIK3CA Mutation and/or PIK3CA Amplification Second-line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AZD5363 highly potent adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) -competitive AKT inhibitor IC50 &lt; 10nmol/l three AKT isoforms . AZD5363 well design inhibit important main signal pathway various human cancer . AZD5363 specific inhibitor AKT pathway activate wide spectrum tumours.The combination AZD5363 standard chemotherapy , paclitaxel , might improve outcomes 2nd line therapy advance gastric cancer patient .</detailed_description>
