	<brief_title>Clinical Prediction Rules Identifying Patients With Chronic Neck Pain Who Will Benefit From General Aerobic Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Recently , Hanney et al ( 2013 ) derive preliminary clinical prediction rule ( CPR ) identify patient neck pain ( NP ) may respond exercise-based treatment program . These CPRs neck exercise consider aerobic exercise ( AE ) NP treatment . Aims study : 1 ) To investigate effect aerobic exercise chronic neck pain ; 2 ) To derive clinical prediction rule identify patient neck pain may benefit aerobic treatment program ; 3 ) To determine prevalence neck pain Israel . Study Design : Double Blind Randomized control trial setting : Outpatients physical therapy clinic `` Clalit Health Services '' Haifa Western Galilee area . Participants : Patients refer physical therapy primary diagnosis chronic non-specific NP . Methods : Following baseline examination subject ` status CPR determine , subject ( CPR positive negative ) randomize , divide research group control group . The CPR status determine accord Hanney 's paper ( e.g . : neck disability Index score &lt; 18/50 , shoulder protraction , cervical side bend &lt; 32Â° , Fear avoidance belief questionnaire-physical activity score &lt; 15 , active regular basis bicycle training ) . Positive CPR accordance 4/5 point . The baseline examination include : active passive cervical range motion , neurological exam ( reflex , sensation , muscle test ) , cervical segmental mobility ( accessory movement ) , neck muscle length , cervical manual muscle test posture assessment . The research group receive neck exercise program neck massage AE ( leg bicycling relaxed shoulder ) control group receive neck exercise program neck massage . Both intervention deliver physiotherapist 10 treatment include home exercise program . Immediate examination use last treatment ( 10 treatment ) , 3 6 month follow examination long-term effect . In addition , Data collect physiotherapy department `` Clalit Health Services '' statistic patient NP refer physical therapy include : Prevalence , demographic profile data</detailed_description>
