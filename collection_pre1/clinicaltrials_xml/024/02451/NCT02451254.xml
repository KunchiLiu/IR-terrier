	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation confers 5-fold increase risk stroke absence valvular heart disease . Although epidemiological study link various clinical echocardiographic risk factor stroke , exact mechanism increase risk stroke AF remain poorly understood . Previous report suggest loss effective atrial contraction AF associate thrombogenesis . Microthrombi likely form leave atrial appendage . In contrast , intravascular thrombotic event patient without AF generally associate abnormality vascular endothelial function and/or coagulation system . On assumption 90 % cardiac thrombus patient AF form LA appendage , fact thrombi identify 15-20 % patient AF clinical risk factor ischemic stroke , deem `` lethal attachment '' . Administration anticoagulant therapy generally think necessary preventive measure patient high risk thromboembolism , data indicate inadequate implementation highly effective therapy ] . Several study find regional difference platelet activation hypercoagulability LA compare systemic circulation patient valvular nonvalvular AF , suggest local contribute factor . Animal study demonstrate increased platelet activation endothelial dysfunction acute AF . The ability antiplatelet agent reduce risk cardioembolic event AF suggest platelet may contribute pathophysiology . Platelet activation occur AF rapid atrial pacing , provide possible mechanistic link . Other biomarkers propose improve prediction thromboembolotic event patient population include von Willebrand factor D-dimer cerebral imaging . A comprehensive understanding pathophysiological sequence lead thrombus formation LAA patient AF could helpful characterize high risk thromboembolic event , subsequently optimize management high risk patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim : To compare biomarkers mediator associate arterial venous thrombosis blood sample LA , RA , systemic circulation patient AF . Methods population : A prospective trial patient undergo circumferential ablation pulmonary vein . For clinical procedure , conventional transeptal puncture perform . In begin procedure , follow transeptal puncture , intravenous administration unfractionated heparin ( bolus 50-100 IU/kg ) , blood sample simultaneously collect peripheral femoral venous sheath , arterial line , right atrial sheath , LA sheath . Samples RA LA collect sheath position midchamber close appendage . Each Patient provide 40ml blood follow blood test : ( 1 ) Blood count . ( 2 ) Fibrinogen ( 3 ) Factor VIII ( 4 ) D-dimer ( 5 ) P-selectin ( 6 ) von Willebrand factor ( 7 ) TEG - Thromboelastography Serum plasma sample store future test .</detailed_description>
