	<brief_summary>Recent advance acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment base cytotoxic drug combination . Measurement minimal residual disease bone marrow sample day 14 treatment powerful early predictive indicator relapse , apply practically patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Even , observe patient present negative minimal residual disease bone marrow sample day 7 induction good prognosis achieve day 14 . Relapse represent main cause treatment failure relate extreme resistance apoptosis , define latter principal mechanism program cell death ; also relate induction leukemic cell senescent arrest . Pentoxifylline methyl-xanthine byproduct consider unspecific inhibitor phosphodiesterase . It inhibit nuclear factor-kappa-beta activation different mechanism stimulate apoptosis induced different drug ; thus , optimize antineoplastic effect actual treatment order increase apoptosis leukemic cell . This effect might improve prognosis patient . Evaluate safety effect Pentoxifylline together antineoplastic drug order study increase apoptosis decrease senescence remission induction phase pediatric patient newly diagnose acute lymphoblastic leukemia . To achieve propose , divide patient two group , receive pentoxifylline placebo depend group , addition conventional treatment accord protocol standard chemotherapy schema pediatric patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia institution remission induction phase . In addition , test whether study group exert impact reach remission earlier compare control group .</brief_summary>
