	<brief_summary>Apparently balance chromosomal rearrangement ( ABCR ) associate abnormal phenotype rare problematic event . It occur 6 % de novo reciprocal translocation 9 % de novo inversion . Abnormal phenotype , include intellectual disability / multiple congenital anomaly ( ID/MCA ) may explain either associate cryptic genomic imbalance detectable array-CGH gene disruption breakpoint . However , breakpoint clone use conventional method ( i.e. , fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) , Southern blot ) often laborious time consume perform routinely . Without complete investigation rearrangement , genetic counseling real challenge . Recently , investigator others show Next-Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) powerful rapid technique characterize ABCR breakpoints molecular level . The ANI project ( ABCR NGS ID ) aim characterize molecular level ABCR 55 patient present intellectual disability and/or multiple congenital anomaly ( ID/MCA ) use NGS . The investigator make hypothesis ABCR account patient phenotype , either gene disruption position effect , since genomic imbalance would previously exclude array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization ( CGH ) . The ANI project 3-year-long study conduct consortium 21 partner , include 19 french hospital cytogenetics laboratory , research team ( TIGER ) , cellular biotechnology center . Patients recruit Cytogenetics laboratory . ABCR breakpoints molecularly characterize NGS first bio-informatics analysis . The result verify amplification junction fragment polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) follow Sanger sequencing , allow localization breakpoints base-pair level . In complex case , FISH experiment necessary clarify result . A second bio-informatics analysis determine breakpoints ' characteristic ( sequence , repeat element , gene regulatory element ) . Finally , breakpoint , gene expression study perform include gene disrupt breakpoint two neighboring gene . All data , together already available literature database integrate determine gene could account patient 's phenotype , allow appropriate genetic counseling . This project identify new candidate gene involve ID developmental anomaly . It also contribute development evaluation NGS diagnostic tool ABCR ID/MCA . It also allow unravel mechanism functional consequence ABCR , particular term position effect . In conclusion , ANI project contribute improvement diagnostic management genetic counseling patient ID/MCA ABCR . It also contribute understand ABCR physiopathology unravel pathway involve development brain function , thus improve genetic counseling ID/MCA patient general .</brief_summary>
