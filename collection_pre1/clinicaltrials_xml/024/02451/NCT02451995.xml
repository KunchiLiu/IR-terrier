	<brief_summary>Tachycardia 's ( fast heart rhythm ) lead troublesome palpitation , dizziness , blackouts breathlessness . They cause either cluster abnormal cell within heart , electrical short circuit rotate rapidly around heart . Sometimes controlled tablet , though owing side effect many patient want something else . Many tachycardia 's cured procedure know `` ablation '' . In essence , either focus abnormal cell narrow point short circuit cause abnormal heart rhythm ( source ) electrically destroy ( burnt ) result restoration normal heart beat . One form tachycardia know Atrial Tachycardia ( AT ) . These arise top two chamber heart ( atrium ) . Interestingly , problem frequently see patient previously undergone ablation surgical procedure condition call Atrial Fibrillation . In others reason occurrence unknown . Current strategy find `` source '' ablation procedure technically challenge result long procedure time . Sometimes wrong source find result ablation incorrect site . Ripple Mapping ( RM ) novel system Investigators Imperial College look study . RM display electrical information within heart series bar come chamber , bar represent signal travel heart . By see pattern electrical information , believe show pattern tachycardia well conventional technique . In previous study conduct , RM find source tachycardia 80 % map , compare 50 % current system . Investigators Imperial College identify get 100 % believe , future , RM find source tachycardia first time , every time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Conventional mapping strategy use find `` source '' `` atrial tachycardia '' within heart technically challenge result long procedure time . Sometimes wrong source find result ablation incorrect site . In retrospective study conduct investigator Imperial College , Ripple Mapping find source tachycardia 80 % time , compare 50 % conventional map . They since study reason achieve 100 % , could improve matter retrospective dataset . They believe , future , Ripple map find source tachycardia first time , every time . The purpose study prospectively test whether Ripple Mapping well find source `` atrial tachycardia '' ( AT ) conventional mapping . Patients refer clinically indicate AT ablation electrophysiologist recruit . For patient recruit study , block randomize 2 arm : Ripple Mapping guide AT substrate ablation , Conventional AT guide Ablation ( activation map entrainment ) . Following explanation study patient allow time decide whether would like participate . Following completion consent procedure patient undergo electrophysiology study routine standard practice . This usually perform inserting plastic tube ( catheter ) heart use vessel groin local anaesthetic . Once catheter atrium ( top chamber heart ) catheter move different location chamber gather electrical information tissue . Using `` CARTO3v4 '' , 3D map geometry heart chamber construct . Patient randomize RM proceed follow : Once sufficient point collect , Ripple Map play order diagnose source tachycardia . The time diagnosis record . The operator 's confidence diagnosis define 4 point scale ( Grade I High diagnostic confidence Grade IV diagnosis Nondiagnostic ) . In context grade 1 diagnosis , operator proceed ablation define source Ripple map . Termination tachycardia ablation use confirm diagnosis correct . The time tachycardia termination record . Alternatively , new map create operator diagnose source use Ripple map . The operator free revert conventional mapping approach time . Patients randomized conventional ablation proceed accord standard practice operator ( activation map entrainment ) . When operator satisfy adequate number point collect , Diagnostic Grading analysis use . Once , ablation use confirm diagnosis context Grade 1 ablation . The key data compare include : 1 . Diagnostic confidence RM vs conventional mapping 2 . Tachycardia termination follow first series ablation RM vs conventional mapping .</detailed_description>
