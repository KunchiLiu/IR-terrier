	<brief_summary>This clinical trial healthy volunteer administer experimental Ebola vaccine . The investigator vaccinate four group volunteer . Group one receive MVA-EBO Z vaccine dose 1 x 10^8 pfu . Three group receive prime vaccine cAd3-EBO Z follow boost vaccine , MVA EBO Z . The second group volunteer receive boost vaccine 14 +/-7 day dose 1 x 10^8 pfu third fourth group , 28 +/- 7 day different concentration MVA-EBO Z ( 1 x 10^8 pfu group 3 1.5 x 10^8 pfu group 4 ) . The study assess safety vaccination , immune response vaccination . Immune responses measure test blood sample . The cAd3-EBO Z MVA-EBO Z vaccine call viral vectored vaccine . They make virus modify multiply . The virus extra DNA injection , body make Ebola protein ( Ebola develop ) , immune system build response Ebola without infect . Healthy volunteer recruit Oxford London England . The study fund Wellcome Trust .</brief_summary>
