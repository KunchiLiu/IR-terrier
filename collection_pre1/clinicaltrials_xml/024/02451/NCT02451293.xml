	<detailed_description>AIM Depression Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS - myocardial infarction unstable angina ) highly prevalent associate 2.5 fold increase all-cause morbidity mortality . Sleep disturbance integrate part pathology depression severe consequence quality life . Melatonin show potential reduce depressive symptom anxiety . Likewise melatonin show sleep improving effect several population also patient depression . Melatonin potentially reduce incidence depression sleep disturbance patient myocardial infarction . The project set answer follow hypothesis : 1 . Melatonin due antidepressant effect prevent reduce incidence depressive symptom patient ACS . 2 . Melatonin due anxiolytic effect prevent reduce incidence anxiety patient ACS . 3 . Melatonin due hypnotic circadian effect prevent development sleep circadian disturbance patient ACS . BACKGROUND In Denmark 8600 year suffer acute myocardial infarction . An acute myocardial infarction life-changing event affect people 's life long blood clot . 20 % develop moderate severe depression require pharmacological treatment 50 % experience depressive symptom initial treatment . Depression acute coronary syndrome associate 2.5-fold increased mortality , 1.5-fold increase risk recurrence thrombosis . Screening patient depression therefore recommend Danish cardiology Association American Heart Association . Depression require treatment depression myocardial infarction associate reduce quality life , reduce compliance medication , reduce participation cardiac rehabilitation , less likelihood occupational activity . Medical treatment depression would traditionally selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) first-line treatment . SSRI associate side-effects sleep disorder , sexual disorder heart rhythm disturbance . As alternative SSRIs , investigator focus endogenous hormone melatonin virtually side-effect free . Previous experiment show 1000 mg melatonin daily one month associate mild drowsiness increase . Melatonin regulate body 's circadian rhythm play important role hypnotic stabilize sleep night . Sleep disorder integral part pathogenesis depression important development depression . Method The investigator perform double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized trial patient allocate either melatonin placebo prophylactic setup . Participants follow 12 week , three clinical visit depression measurement every two week . Depression study measure Major Depression Inventory ( MDI ) , self-rating form 12 question . The questionnaire well study validate Danish population . The question cover 10 ICD-10 symptom depression , recommend use general practice . MDI flexible tool use diagnostic tool time measure instrument severity depressive disorder . MDI administer clinic visit use outpatient phase , patient follow continuously every two week throughout study . Should treatment demand depression ( moderate/severe ) participant refer dedicated psychiatrist perform Hamilton evaluation make treatment recommendation . Participants also assess depression anxiety use Hospital anxiety depression scale ( HADS ) . A large Danish study patient myocardial infarction show prevalence depression 20 % , HADS also use compare include non-participating patient ( external validity ) . Melatonin show ameliorative effect sleep circadian rhythm . Sleep circadian rhythm disorder integral part development maintenance depression . These monitor intensively actigraphy ( objective sleep measurement ) , Pittsburgh sleep quality index ( PSQI ) , sleep diary visual analog scale inclusion meeting first clinical control . Afterwards subjective sleep measurement perform every two week . Sample size calculated basis conservative assumption , 31 % patient follow ACS develop depressive symptom , investigator assume reduce 15.5 % Melatonin treatment . Power calculation base two-sided test , power 0.80 significance level 5 % ( alfa= 0.05 ) , require sample size group 116 . There interim efficacy analysis plan . The study proceed 120 patient enrolled arm . MEFACS subtrial ( single center ) The objective MEFACS study investigate whether prophylactic treatment melatonin effect endothelial dysfunction . Secondarily , objective investigate effect melatonin inflammation marker . The MEFACS trial sub-trial MEDACIS trial , The MEFACS trial carry single center trial subpopulation patient enrol MEDACIS trial . The MEFACS trial include 2 x 15 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients admit coronary care unit acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , enrol within 4 week primary ACS . 2 . Participants 18 year old . 3 . No sign depression Major Depression Inventory ( MDI ) point enrolment . 4 . Participants must sign informed consent form 5 . Females menopause ( define menstruation last 12 month ) negative pregnancy test . 1 . Known allergic reaction melatonin . 2 . Ongoing previous pharmacological treat depression bipolar disorder . 3 . No dementia determine mini mental state examination score ( MMSE ) &lt; 24 4 . At point inclusion participation another pharmacological intervention trial allow . 5 . No diagnose Rotor DubinJohnson syndrome , epilepsy , sleep apnoea syndrome , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) multiple sclerosis allow . 6 . Severe liver disease define transaminase X 3 normal level , severe kidney disease define eGRF 40 ml/min . 7 . Ongoing hypnotic treatment . 8 . Known sleep disorder ( e.g . insomnia , restless leg etc . ) 9 . Work involve nightshifts . 10 . Daily alcohol consumption 5 unit alcohol ( 1 unit = 12 g alcohol ) 11 . Predictable poor compliance ( e.g . speak fluent Danish ) 12 . Pregnant breastfeeding . 13 . Severe , lifethreatening medical condition , imply patient participate study course . ( e.g . cancer , stroke , ) 14 . Indication coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) . For MEFACS subtrial ( single center ) 15 . Conditions preclude/make impossible measurement reliable RHI ( e.g . patient one arm , know sidedifference brachial arterial blood pressure factor ) .</criteria>
