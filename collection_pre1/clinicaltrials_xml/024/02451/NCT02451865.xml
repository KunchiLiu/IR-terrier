	<brief_title>Binimetinib With Docetaxel Treating Patients With Previously Treated , Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety tolerability increase dos MEK162 ( binimetinib ) docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 21 day patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) progress least one prior systemic therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective tumor response rate ( RR ) define Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 MEK162 standard dose docetaxel stage IV NSCLC . II . Determine progression free survival ( PFS ) MEK162 standard dos docetaxel . III . Evaluate pharmacokinetic profile MEK162 give along docetaxel . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate tissue biomarkers baseline tumor time progression correlate clinical outcome II . Assess activation status extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) , protein kinase B ( Akt ) ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( S6K ) tumor biopsy sample baseline time progression . III . Determine cytokine profile treatment patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study binimetinib . Patients receive binimetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) day 21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease well complete 6 course binimetinib docetaxel may continue receive binimetinib PO BID absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
