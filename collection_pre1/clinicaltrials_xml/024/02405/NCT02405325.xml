	<detailed_description>In 2-year cluster randomize controlled field trial 408 ethnically diverse , old adult ( 50+ year old ) 12 low income community center serve senior San Diego County investigator investigate : 1 . The efficacy PEP4PA ( Peer Empowerment Program 4 Physical Activity ) reduce disparity PA increase percentage participant achieve 150 minute PA per week 6 12 month . Hypothesis : Participants PEP4PA significantly increase PA minute moderate intensity ( measure objectively accelerometry ) great extent old adult receive usual care ( e.g . normal PA programing ) control center great percent meet NHANES criterion weekly PA. 2 . The efficacy PEP4PA improve physical functioning , blood pressure ( BP ) , depressive symptom quality life . Hypothesis : Participants PEP4PA significantly increase physical functioning ( measure objectively short physical performance battery 400m time walk ) , decrease systolic BP ( mmHg ) report depressive symptom , improve quality life score ( measure baseline , 6 &amp; 12 month ) great extent old adult control center . 3 . Assess incremental cost effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) PEP4PA term cost per MET hour cost per QALY compare usual programming control center 12 month . 4 . Evaluate impact PEP4PA secondary outcome sedentary time sleep quality ( measure accelerometry ) , cognitive/executive functioning , walk route ( GPS ) 12 month . Exploratory aim : 5 . Examine individual , interpersonal , organizational , environmental factor affect implementation &amp; behavior change . 6 . Assess efficacy , effectiveness ICER PEP4PA 24 month</detailed_description>
