	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death male , increase female . Up 73 % affected patient present Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Most lung cancer patient average survival 8 month diagnosis . Lobectomy initial stage demonstrate high survival rate , 15 % 25 % surgical candidate ; unfortunately , cardiopulmonary impairment mainly due coexist COPD reduces number patient undergo medical treatment marginal lung resection , minor functional impact possible ineffective control disease . Furthermore , COPD associate increase postoperative morbidity mortality , long in-hospital stay , need additional treatment , rise sanitary cost . The investigator plan randomised trial surgical candidate assess effect comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation functional surgical outcome , functioning , Quality Life ( QoL ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation ameliorate functional parameter responsible inoperability COPD patient ; candidate surgery could benefit functional improvement term wider possible lung resection low incidence postoperative complication . Likewise , postoperative respiratory rehabilitation significantly improve respiratory function exercise capacity treat patient effect long-term functioning QoL know . Current study present small-sized sample short follow . The impact comprehensive rehabilitation overall functioning , depression , pain , QoL report COPD patient . Moreover , rate anatomical resection postoperative morbidity compromise COPD patient treat intensive rehabilitation never report randomised trial . The investigator hypothesise : comprehensive rehabilitation intervention lung cancer patient eligible surgical treatment may reduce pain , comorbidity ( pneumonia pulmonary complication require treatment ) , depression , deconditioning improve QoL 1 6 month surgery ; active lifestyle regular follow may reduce long-term quality life decline ; early pulmonary rehabilitation improve lung function test make proper surgical treatment curative intent possible patient affect COPD otherwise treat medically marginal operation . Investigators plan randomise trial 2 parallel arm : patient resectable ( T1-2 N0-1 ) diagnose suspect lung cancer enrol study pre-operative interview thoracic surgery consultant randomise physician data manager ( T0 ) . The Intervention Group ( IG ) receive overall rehabilitation treatment base 10 session pre-operative outpatient PR , early inpatient post-operative PR , long-term exercise begin 1 month surgery last 15 session . Control Group ( CG ) receive Standard Care ( SC ) base upon physiatrist counsel day surgery early inpatient post-operative PR . Both group receive re-evaluation , necessary , optimization COPD therapy enter study ; final follow 6 month surgery group ( T3 ) , intermediate evaluation plan immediately surgery ( T1 ) 1 month surgical treatment ( T2 ) . The 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) prove correlate functional status patient respiratory impairment ; measurement impact Pulmonary Rehabilitation ( PR ) 6MWT primary outcome study . Investigators expect kind treatment improve exercise tolerance express 6MWT , assess T0 , T1 , T2 T3 IG . Values 6MWT CG assess T0 T3 ( T1 change therapy occur ) . It demonstrate PR educational therapy optimize respiratory function COPD patient . Investigators asses change pulmonary function Lung Function Tests ( LFT ) : complete spirometry ( static dynamic volume Diffusing Capacity Carbon Oxide ) perform T0 , T1 e T3 IC . The CG evaluate T0 T3 ( T1 change therapy occur ) . COPD patient eligible lung cancer surgery often undergo sub-lobar resection preserve respiratory function ; PR could reduce lung impairment increase rate lobectomy subset patient . By optimize lung function , investigator expect reduction post-operative complication length hospital stay . This evaluate 1 month surgery ( T2 ) . The therapeutic strategy lung cancer complex ; cause physical psychological symptom significantly impair patient ' QoL . This important outcome assess Short-Form 12 questionnaire ( SF12 ) T0 T3 . Pain depression also monitor specific scale : Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) pain Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) measure depression . Pain evaluation plan T0 , T2 T3 , depression T0 , T1 T3 . Since publish data mean standard deviation 6MWT lung surgery without treatment , Cohen 's medium effect size ( d=0.5 ) use compute sample size ( n=140 ) . Normality continuous variable assess Shapiro-Wilk test decide statistical technique use . Thus , Student use normal variable , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test use others . Categorical variable ( presence/absence complication ) analyze 2x2 table significance assess Chi-squared test . Risks describe Odds Ratio relate Confidence Interval . With regard primary endpoint , IC expect improve 6MWT 6 month least 25 metre compare CG . We also expect improvement postoperative outcome ( less morbidity short in-hospital stay ) long-term QoL , pain depression level . An overall 10 % drop-out rate estimate , due factor like perioperative death major complication need adjuvant treatment ( would overlap postoperative rehabilitation deeply impact result ) . Moreover , overall randomization could produce imbalance two group feature ; presence significant non-homogeneity treat versus control arm , propensity score matching analysis apply reduce bias due confound factor .</detailed_description>
