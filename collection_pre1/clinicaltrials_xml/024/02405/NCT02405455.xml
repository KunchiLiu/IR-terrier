	<brief_summary>Cervical incompetence relatively complex disorder diagnostic therapeutic point view . Despite establish diagnostic criterion , easy specialist clinical practice establish limit complicate case . Cervical cerclage technique classically use avoid pregnancy loss preterm birth patient cervical incompetence . Although numerous study support efficacy , remain controversial method , give technique implies clinician patient . Difficulties potential risk insertion inconvenience side effect patient still exist . The recently publish promising result use pessary prevent preterm birth woman short cervix offer new prospectives management prematurity prevention . The short learning curve , good cost-effectiveness , importantly , low side effect , render pessary tool great potential .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis To ascertain whether cervical pessary reduce preterm delivery rate 37 week woman cervical incompetence , least 33.5 % 26.6 % , cervical cerclage . Objectives The main aim evaluate result cervical pessary compare cerclage patient diagnose cervical incompetence . Secondary aim include assessment morbility produce pessary compare cerclage acertain economic impact pessary use patient . Methods Longitudinal , prospective , randomise pilot study . Inclusion criterion - Singleton pregnancy - 12+0 - 25+6 week gestation - Minimum age : 18 year - History 3 late miscarriage , 3 premature birth , 3 late miscarriage premature birth altogether history one preterm births pregnancy loss second trimester cervical length &lt; 25mm 25+6 week . Sample size : 60 woman , 30 pessary group 30 cerclage group . Randomisation make electronic database especially design 1:1 . The primary outcome delivery 34 week . Secondary outcome preterm birth rate 28 37 week , associate maternal side effect , maternal foetal complication neonatal morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
