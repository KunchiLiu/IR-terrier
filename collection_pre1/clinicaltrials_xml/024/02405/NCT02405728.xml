	<detailed_description>The use peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICCs ) represent major advance hematological patient , enable effective delivery chemotherapy and/or blood product particularly prolonged infusion situation difficult venous access . In modern medical practice use increase rapidly several reason , include ease insertion , many us ( e.g. , drug administration venous access ) , perceive safety , cost-effectiveness compare central venous catheter ( CVCs ) . Despite benefit , PICCs associate deep vein thrombosis arm pulmonary embolism . These complication , often call venous thromboembolism , important complicate interrupt treatment , also increase cost , morbidity mortality . Despite effect , burden risk PICC-related venous thromboembolism uncertain clinician scarce evidence base choice vascular access . Evidence choose one vascular access lack literature , particular patient affect haematological malignancy , chemotherapy likely cause myelosuppression , major risk bloodstream infection . Furthermore , precise incidence risk PICC-related venous thromboembolism relative CVCs unknown . An understanding risk context grow PICC use important cost patient safety question . Up , systematic review do investigate question .</detailed_description>
