	<detailed_description>Material Methods Subjects recruit consequently primary care , Department Endocrinology . Study population The investigator include four category subject : 1. patient type 2 diabetes ; 2. patient pre-diabetes ; 3. patient obesity ; 4. healthy volunteer . All category expose exactly study design . Protocols : Various protocol use study , collect information status inclusion , able measure change anthropometry , health status symptom study period . Study-questionnaire : This questionnaire similar questionnaire use great population cohort Malmö Diet Cancer Study ( MDCS , general population Malmö , N = 28 000 ) , Malmö Offspring Study ( MOS ) ( general population Malmö , child grandchildren participant MDCS , calculate include 5000 participant , start 2013 , support grant VR ) . It also use newly start endoscopy study consecutive patient perform colonoscopy Department Gastroenterology Malmö include ( calculate include 2000 participant ) . The questionnaire contain question socioeconomic factor , life style factor ( include diet , smoking , stuff use , alcohol habit , physical activity ) , medical health , drug consumption , heredity factor gastrointestinal symptom . Nutrition questionnaire : This questionnaire use get information ordinary diet , energy intake , . This basic information use plan diet Life Science Lab , similar energy supply breakfast provide . 36-item Short-Form questionnaire ( SF-36 ) : This world-wide use instrument evaluate quality life . It use measure quality life many various disease , norm value reference available . The instrument measure physical functioning , role functional-physical , bodily pain , general health , vitality , social functioning , role functioning-emotional , mental health . These parameter valuable evaluate , estimate effect evoke daily life , change life style factor . Anthropometric protocol : This questionnaire use screen study participant inclusion , able exclude patient already ongoing weight-reducing diet . In addition , contain question BMI , body composition , basal physical examination . Satiety scoring : This protocol use previous study group , estimate degree hunger/satiety standardize meal . Nutrition : All subject get diet deliver free charge Life Science Lab ( Lund University ) . Life Science Lab found 1998 lead medical technical research advance cardiovascular thoracic surgery science . Due importance life style effect cardiovascular disease well-being , Life Science Lab also conduct life style-related science reduce know risk factor cardiovascular disease . The main focus develop healthy nutrition normal food formula reform food-meal composition everyone . The meal-diet consist ordinary raw , minimal industrial processing . The food base traditional Nordic raw , e.g . whole grain , vegetable , leguminous , root crop , fat fish , bird , fruit , berry nut . At time , amount sugar , read meat , process meat , dairy product limit . The diet good nutritional supply , contain less calorie usually recommend ( 2000 kcal/day compare 2400 kcal/day ) . The meal plan together kitchen Life science Lab . Food composition , recipe , instruction cook food deliver regularly Life Science Lab lunch dinner . The breakfast subject plan together PI nutritionist Life Science Lab , subject buy food . Three alternative suggest , depend ordinary breakfast ingest , describe nutrition questionnaire . Neuropeptides/inflammatory marker : The neuropeptides , precursor , study serum/plasma peptide involve regulation satiety digestion , e.g . cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , gastrin , ghrelin , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , glucagon-like peptide-2 ( GLP-2 ) , leptin , motilin , neurotensin , oxytocin , peptide YY ( PYY ) . To evaluate permeability defect intestinal mucosa , level zonulin bacterial endotoxin , i.e . lipopolysaccharides , measure plasma . Low-graded inflammation reflect high-sensitive C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI-1 ) , factor involve AGE analyze . In addition , different cytokine , tracer , routine analysis perform . Cooperation laboratories Denmark Great Britain establish . Gut microbiota : DNA extraction Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism ( T-RFLP ) quantification specific bacterial group do quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) accordance protocol investigator use describe earlier research group . As reference , restrict number sample analyze massively-parallel pyrosequencing partial ribosomal ribonucleic acid ( rRNA ) ribosomal gene . The gut microbiota bacterial constitution ( bacterial specie ) correlate gastrointestinal symptom disease , change bio- inflammatory marker . Study Design When group patient recruit , investigator information meeting whole group . At meeting , hold PI , subject receive medical information metabolic disease , nutrition effect health disease . After initial meeting , subject handle individually . For overview , se flow-chart , last page . At inclusion , subject complete questionnaire examination : 1 . Study-questionnaire contain question ordinary lifestyle factor , socioeconomic factor , health- drug information , heredity , gastrointestinal symptom ; 2 . Nutrition questionnaire contain information ordinary food habit 3 . Quality life questionnaire SF-36 ; 4 . Anthropometric protocol , include nutritional screening , complete investigator ; 5 . Eight tube ( SST- phenolsulfotransferase platelet survival time ( PST ) - ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) tube ) , à 6 ml , collect serum , plasma blood cell . Feces sample microbiota analysis . Urine sample night . All biological material store -20 ◦C -80◦ C later analyse , analyze ( Hb , leukocytes , thrombocyte , CRP , electrolytes , liver enzymes , lipid , bleed status , glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , insulin , fp-glucose , HbA1c thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , cobalamin , folate routine urine analysis incl microalbuminuria ) . The questionnaire 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , experimental procedure repeat 3 month diet termination 6 month , standard food last 3 month . Two week introduction new diet , insulin , glucose proinsulin measure plasma/serum , along anthropometric protocol . Some subject group follow 3 month protocol study design mention , continue food intake usual , see psychological effect participate study make difference body weight , blood pressure , symptom . After , subject offer modify diet well . During evaluation diet , subject continue degree physical activity previously . No dietary supplement fish oil , probiotic multivitamin drug allow take . As one visit restaurant another diet per week allow . Journeys stay longer time period another place must discuss leader research . Maximal intake alcoholic beverage 30 g ethanol/week . 12 g ethanol corresponds follow : 1 bottle ( 50cl ) ordinary beer , 1 bottle ( 33cl ) strong beer , 1 glass ( 15cl ) wine , 1 glass ( 8cl ) strong wine , 1 glass ( 4cl ) spirit . formula : volume % x ml volume/100 x 0.8 . Test meal substudy The patient come fast ( 12 h ) morning , bring breakfast consume . Before start meal , two blood sample take 10 min . After start meal , new blood sample collect 10 , 20 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 min afterwards . Each blood sample consist 6 ml plasma . At time interval , satiety score complete . With day , procedure perform previous ordinary , daily breakfast replace new diet , 2 test meal perform run-in ; one ordinary breakfast one new diet breakfast . During whole study , PI close contact ( email phone ) patient able support patient enhance compliance much possible .</detailed_description>
