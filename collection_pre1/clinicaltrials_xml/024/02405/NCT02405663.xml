	<brief_title>Methods Placental Delivery Amount Blood Loss During Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean section ( CS ) one commonly perform major abdominal operation woman worldwide rate increase dramatically every year . Some report short-term morbidity include hemorrhage , postoperative fever endometritis . The method deliver placenta one procedure may contribute increase decrease morbidity CS . On average 0.5-1 liter blood lose CS , many variable technique try reduce blood loss . Such technique include finger split versus scissor cut incision , situ stitching verse exteriorization stitch uterus , finally spontaneous manual removal placenta . Two common method use deliver placenta CS cord traction manual removal . Manual removal placenta obstetrician introduce hand uterine cavity cleave placenta decidua basalis soon possible delivery infant control cord traction obstetrician external uterine massage gentle traction expose umbilical cord facilitate placental delivery . Opinions differ best placental delivery technique CS . Some trial show reduce risk blood loss control cord traction ( 3 ) others show manual removal placenta CS increase perioperative blood loss . Authors conclude manual delivery placenta significantly associate great operative blood loss great decrease postoperative hemoglobin level postpartum maternal infectious morbidity shorter operative time compare spontaneous placental separation . In addition , know blood loss CS delivery difficult estimate , numerous different method include serial change hematocrit ( Hct ) , hemoglobin ( Hb ) level , visual estimation gravimetric method describe . A low , significant , correlation find visually estimate blood loss perioperative hemoglobin change woman deliver CS . However , hemoglobin , hematocrit level visual estimation commonly use technique estimate blood loss delivery .</detailed_description>
