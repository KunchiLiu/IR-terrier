	<detailed_description>Trial protocol V2.0 - Hyperbaric chamber treatment CRVO patient Assaf HaRofe Medical Center - Zerifin , Israel Purpose : To determine whether hyperbaric chamber treatment improve functionality symptom relate CRVO Introduction : Central Retinal Vein Occlusion ( CRVO ) profound effect retinal circulation . As vein collect entire venous outflow retina , retinal perfusion greatly impaired occludes . Even though , compensation , collateral outflow expand nevertheless increase retinal venous pressure , venous dilation , retinal hemorrhage retinal edema . Reduction blood flow lead retinal hypoxia upregulation vascular endothelial growth factor ( VGEF ) In CRVO variable degree capillary nonperfusion visible fluorescein angiography ( FA ) divide `` ischemic '' `` non ischemic '' depend size area non perfusion FA . Possible complication CRVO include chronic cystoid macular edema ( CME ) , neovascularization retina , neovascular glaucoma vitreous hemorrhage . These complication serious , sight threatening , require prolonged treatment . Current therapy CRVO require different treatment modality depend complication . Neovascularization treat mainly laser photocoagulation ( PRP - pan retinal photocoagulation ) VEGF inhibitor . Photocoagulation base lower oxygen consumption peripheral retina . Macular edema treat anti VEGF and/or steroidal injection . Most patient require continuous monthly injection may last year order dehydrate macula . Recent clinical trial CRUISE BRAVO show immediate monthly injection anti VEGF ( Ranibizumab ) first 6 month later need decrease substantially time achieve visual acuity gain follow CRVO5 . In BRAVO trial cumulative proportion patient gain 15 letter baseline 12 month ( CRVO incidence ) 50 % ( sham ) , 68 % ( ranibizumab 0.3 mg ) , 71 % ( ranibizumab 0.5 mg ) CRUISE trial 42 % , 61 % , 66 % , respectively . Another trial evaluate effect anti VEGF COPERNICUS trial patient CRVO receive intravitreal aflibercept injection every 4 week 6 month follow CRVO . The control group receive sham injection proportion patient gain â‰¥ 15 letter 56.1 % versus 12.3 % ( P &lt; 0.001 ) week 24 . Improved reduction central retinal thickness increase vitreous hemorrhage major side effect ( 6.8 % ) also evident patient treat aflibercept . Although effective , anti VEGF injection expose patient many possible side effect include sub conjunctival hemorrhage transient hypertension mild end spectrum endophthalmitis lens injury severe end . An alternative treatment use steroid dexamethasone intravitreal implant ( Ozurdex ) . However , treatment may induce side effect increase ocular pressure , cataract , allergy , conjunctival hemorrhage eye pain . Hypoxic induction cytokine , VEGF , play central role CRVO consequences retinal edema iris neovascularization . Hyperbaric chamber potential increase oxygen perfusion perhaps decrease retinal hypoxia , thereby decrease induction cytokine improve retinal functionality . The investigator ' broad experience hyperbaric chamber treatment reveals rather benign treatment compare alternative relevant side effect eligible patient usually ear barotrauma . Investigative Device : Hyperbaric chamber assist increase amount oxygen plasma tissue prove beneficial treat different ischemic wound , acute retinal artery occlusion ( ARAO ) effect n't test CRVO patient yet . Methods : Patients chronic CRVO receive monthly injection Bevacizumab treatment least 12 month recruit . Upon recruitment patient undergo screen Ophthalmologic examination include visual acuity , refraction OCT . This follow series 40 daily hyperbaric chamber treatment . A repeated ophthalmic examination do 20 40 hyperbaric session .</detailed_description>
