	<detailed_description>This investigation include 179 patient ( 119 study device 60 control device ) enrol 15 active center . In addition subset 24 RA patient enrol analyzed separately . The trial design randomize , non-inferiority study compare result CMRH result MRH . This multi-site study patient either receive CMRH MRH . Sequential enrollment patient meet inclusion criterion agree study enrol . The patient sign inform consent agree accept either investigational control device . In addition , surgeon know device patient receive day surgery attempt reduce bias . The surgeon open envelope time surgery determine CMRH MRH implant . Additional effort eliminate bias study include final radiographic analysis independent observer experience report orthopedic device . The independent reviewer grade surgical implant determine radiographic success/failure patient . Implants assign patient clinical site block randomization fashion . The randomization site specific . At give site , consecutive block six enrol patient treated receive random assignment CMRH MRH 2:1 . The randomization schedule generate computer ( NQuery ) produce block 6 , 4 study device 2 control device .</detailed_description>
