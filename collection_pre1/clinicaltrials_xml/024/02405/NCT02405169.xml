	<detailed_description>METHODS/PROCEDURES A randomize control multi-center clinical study design determine whether difference exist outcome treatment Astra tech implant place accord six four implant protocol . The investigation perform four center : three Italy affiliate Institute Franci one affiliate Department Prosthodontics , Faculty Odontology , Malmö University . In center clinician examiner person . The study protocol approve Regional Human Review Board Padova General Hospital . An investigator ' meeting arrange prior start patient ' recruitment . Following screen examination , subject meet inclusion criterion , sign Informed Consent enrol study . The period patient enrollment begin January 1 2013 end December 31 2013 . The patient randomize method base use seal opaque envelope . The case assign two different treatment group : Group A- four implant ( Test ) Group B- six implant ( Control ) Pre-treatment Patient data , medical history , clinical radiographic examination record patient . Clinical photograph take frontal , occlusal lateral projection . Periodontal , endodontic open caries lesion treat prior implant installation . All patient receive careful oral hygiene instruction train self-performed plaque control measure . CT scan compute exam carry . Plaster model diagnostic wax-up carried . First Surgical Phase ( Implant Installation ) The patient receive antibiotic prophylaxis ( Amoxicillin 1gr ) one hour prior surgery completion implant installation suture removal 1gr three time day . ( If patient allergic amoxicillin examiner prescribes antibiotic discretion posology ) . The surgical treatment perform local anesthesia . In case remain teeth , extract conventional technique implant ' placement . ( 13-14 ) Implants place accord guideline describe Astra Tech® manual `` Surgical procedure '' , use two-stage protocol . Implant spin position cover screw registered positive , present , negative . The operation finalize careful adaption flap mean accurate suture order obtain full periosteal coverage . Intraoral clinical photograph , surgery take . Post-operative care The patient instruct rinse chlorhexidine 0.12 % mouthrinse tell rinse antiseptic solution three time day 2 week . The patient advise take NSAIDs pain relief discretion . Liquid semisolid food prescribe first post-operative week , suture remove . Two week operation denture properly reline second stage surgery . Patients control third sixth week . Second surgical phase Prosthetic procedure After eight week ( + 2 ) heal group ( A B ) Uni Abutment 45° connection procedure perform . Impression customize spoon Impregum material take prosthetic procedure perform accord Atlantis-Isus recommendation . After 6 week ( + 2 ) Uni Abutment connection definitive full-arch fix dental prosthesis screw retain apply . The prosthesis make accomplish normal hygienic procedure . All prosthetic procedure make accordance Astra Tech procedures &amp; product manual . The length bridge cantilever duly calculate minimize implant overload accord Atlantis-Isus recommendation ( 15 ) Post-prosthetic measurement Clinical measurement Clinical examination perform immediately follow installation definitive prosthesis ( Baseline-Loading ) 1 , 3 , 5 year . In particular , plaque soft-tissue inflammation register . Clinical photograph take interval point . Plaque : presence plaque score implant site well level remain teeth four surface ( buccal , lingual/palatal , mesial , distal ) . The mean percentage plaque harbor surface calculate use case unit . Soft-tissue inflammation : presence soft-tissue inflammation ( bleed probe ) assess buccal , lingual/palatal , mesial , distal aspect implant . The mean percentage inflame site calculate use case unit . Radiographic measurement Peri-apical radiograph take prosthesis insertion ( Baseline ) 1 , 3 , 5 year . The radiograph take X-ray apparatus supply long cone examiner visit time . Rinn centrators use ensure reproducibility measurement marginal bone level change . The radiographic image analyse Department Radiology Sahlgrenska Academy , Gothenburg University experience radiologist otherwise involve study .</detailed_description>
