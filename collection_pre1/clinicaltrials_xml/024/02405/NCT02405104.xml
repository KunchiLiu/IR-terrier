	<brief_title>Chlorzoxazone Hip Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction rationale Background Modern treatment pain follow surgery base multimodal analgesic strategy pain system different point attack struck different type analgesic . This also try reduce consumption opioids associate frequent side effect like nausea , vomit , constipation , difficulty urinating , weather stretch problem Lethargy . But spite intense research last decade , pain arthroplastic surgery hip ( total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) ) knee ( total knee replacement ( TKA ) ) continue significant clinical problem . It current clinical assumption patient pain hip knee region immediately TKA THA tense muscle , reinforces pain behavior . The mechanism muscle tension fully understood . For many year investigator Danish orthopedic department deal patient postoperative pain major joint prosthesis operation muscle relaxant chlorzoxazone . On section include standard chlorzoxazone prescription pain hip knee replacement . chlorzoxazone many year market treatment pain skeletal muscle inhibition mono- polysynaptic reflex CNS . The muscle relax effect mediate inhibitory effect spinal polysynaptic reflex . In placebo-designed clinical study chlorzoxazone 's beneficial effect heterogeneous group patient spasticity , motor neuron syndrome , well muscle pain spasm peripheral musculoskeletal disease able demonstrate significant analgesic effect ; chlorzoxazone also fail show pain-relieving effect treatment back pain It remarkable spite widespread use chlorzoxazone find one study chlorzoxazone use adjuvant pain relieve treatment hip knee surgery ( orthopaedic treatment ) . The current clinical practice therefore make purely empirical basis . The effect must consider uncertain , may case indicate , often adjunct therapy , example analgesic , anti-inflammatory agent , physiotherapy even train . In case , regard chlorzoxazone alternative benzodiazepine . There therefore need prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate potential analgesic effect chlorzoxazone . In intervention study select dosage chlorzoxazone set base recommendation Danish Medicines Information A / S 7 ( http : //pro.medicin.dk/Medicine / Preparations / 638 ) Takeda Pharma A / S. The latter produce chlorzoxazone . The recommendation base current knowledge chlorzoxazones pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic property . chlorzoxazone give study tablet chlorzoxazone , 250 mg , 3 time daily first seven postoperative day . Adverse reaction chlorzoxazone well know . They relatively , mostly mild transient . The frequent adverse event related chlorzoxazone , fatigue dizziness ( 1-10 % patient ) Adverse reaction extent overlap side effect relate perioperative opioid treatment . It therefore possible frequency adverse event overall reduce chlorzoxazone find analgesic ( opioid-sparing ) . Patients hospitalized minimum two night surgery thus close observation period risk side effect great . At time , patient undergo standardized adverse event registration . If , contrary expectation unexpected unacceptable side effect medication promptly interrupt . The study involve group patient ( THA TKA ) , important clinical pain problem . All patient receive well-implemented evidence-based treatment . Thus , anesthesia , analgesia surgical procedure standardize patient receive concomitant consequence usual principle early mobilization 8 ; 9th The plan randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled design patient receive standardized intervention , enable best possible evaluation modality study intervention chlorzoxazone vs. placebo ) . The level pain surgery primary endpoint , record mean well-tested validated tool ( visual analog scale ( VAS ) ) 48 hour operation . The current study could contribute clarification postoperative analgesic effect chlorzoxazone immediately THA TKA . As secondary endpoint , patient functional level determine Oxford Hip / Knee Score 7 day surgery . Furthermore , number tertiary parameter related pain , function side effect profile determine show Table 1 . Evidence area immediate benefit patient operate THA TKA - maybe surgical patient .</detailed_description>
