	<brief_summary>The objective study assess effect preoperative administration oral zinc lozenge incidence postoperative sore throat syndrome . When patient undergo surgery general anesthesia , require ventilation lung help flexible tube ( call endotracheal tube ) place mouth , pass vocal cord , windpipe ( trachea ) . This tube help oxygenate patient , delivers anesthetic gas lung , keep airway open prevent asphyxiation . The procedure invasive uncomfortable , one common consequence sore inflame throat tube take . This term postoperative sore throat ( POST ) . Though intensity severity sore throat varies person person , report incidence high 90 % patient undergoing general anesthesia . Zinc therapy show multiple study reduce severity duration cold symptom , also up-regulate immune system . Recent study show zinc act anti-inflammatory agent maintain integrity skin mucosal membrane ( cover inside mouth throat ) . The aim study evaluate effect give zinc lozenge tube placement postoperative sore throat . After write informed consent receive pre-op , seal cod envelope either zinc lozenge placebo lozenge give patient administer orally , instruction dissolve lozenge suck 30 minute prior surgery . Upon completion surgery emergence general anesthesia , patient extubated transfer post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . Once PACU , patient assess regard incidence severity POST study investigator use standardized scale . The severity POST grade 4-point scale range 0 3 ; 0 sore throat , 1 mild discomfort ( complain upon question ) , 2 moderate sore throat ( complain his/her ) , 3 severe sore throat ( change voice , hoarseness , throat pain ) . This evaluation perform 30 minute , 2 hour , 4 hour , 24 hour post-surgery , assessment 4 hour primary outcome study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zinc Lozenges Their Effect Postoperative Sore Throat Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall purpose study investigate effect preoperative administration oral zinc lozenge postoperative sore throat syndrome consist pain , dysphagia , extreme case hoarseness . It associate cough ( may increase surgical related pain ) difficulty oral intake . The study look change incidence severity POST immediate postoperative period . Postoperative sore throat ( POST ) syndrome common complication endotracheal intubation Prior early study large endotracheal tube utilize provide general anesthesia . The incidence POST time 48 % , small tubes incidence decrease 22 % . It standard care utilize endotracheal tube base size gender patient . In subsequent study reduce incidence POST , rate sore throat control group 17-90 % . The cause POST relate direct local tissue trauma lead inflammation pharyngeal mucosa possibly dry effect non-humidified gas across mucous membranes.. Although multiple treatment recommend POST , none exactly effective , symptom usually ameliorate within 72 hr without treatment . Even though case , still recommend take preventive measure POST . The presence POST surgery patient satisfaction issue also associate long stay post anesthesia recovery unit ( Higgins et al ) . Both pharmacologic non-pharmacologic measure recommend past study . Nonpharmacological method attenuate POST include use smaller-sized endotracheal tube , lubricate endotracheal tube water-soluble jelly , careful airway instrumentation , minimize cuff pressure . Pharmacologic measure include gargle lidocaine , aspirin , ketamine preoperatively , inhalation beclomethasone fluticasone propionate , recently use licorice gargle magnesium lozenges 30 min preoperatively ( Ruetzler , Borazan H ) . Zinc utilize many year topical agent promote epithelial health recovery injury . Several study evaluate effect zinc wound heal epithelial tissue health . These study show supplementation zinc sulfate cause rapid recovery leg gastric ulcer ( Worthington et al ) . It seem zinc increase re-epithelialization , also decrease bacterial activity cause rapid wound heal ( Arbabi-kalati et al ) . Zinc also show immunomodulatory agent monitor modify immune system T-lymphocytes . Decreases zinc serum level lead lymphopenia decline cellular humoral immunity . The effect oral zinc sulfate also utilized treatment oral wound oral surgeon ; moreover , research show zinc supplementation assist recovery mucosal wound treatment tongue ulcer ( Worthington et al ) . A recent study Arbabi-kalati , show high dose oral zinc sulfate ( 220 mg TID ) decrease intensity mucositis , xerostomia , pain individual undergo chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment . The mechanism zinc improve tissue health investigate Sharir et al . model epithelial injury show topical zinc directly activate receptor promote epithelial repair . Keeping study mind , investigator build study use protocol devise Borazan H , evaluate efficacy magnesium lozenges POST . There currently know study look efficacy zinc prevention POST . The investigator use custom compound lozenge local pharmacy 40 mg elemental zinc ( equivalent 174 mg zinc sulfate ) per lozenge , tolerable upper intake level zinc adult define US department Food Nutrition Board . The possible knowledge gain study POST syndrome extend people undergo surgery require endotracheal intubation future .</detailed_description>
