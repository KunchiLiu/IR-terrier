	<brief_title>Pilot Project Creation Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) Response Prediction Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Visits : If find eligible , follow test procedure perform 2 cycle already-scheduled chemotherapy . Within 5 day Cycle 1 chemotherapy : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status disease . You must fast ( eat drink anything except water ) least 6 hour blood draw . On Days 2 3 Cycles 1 2 chemotherapy , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check status disease . You fast least 6 hour Day 3 blood draw . On Day 4 Cycles 1 2 chemotherapy : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check status disease . You must fast least 6 hour blood draw . - During Cycle 1 , FDG-PET/CT scan check status disease . On Day 14 ( +/- 5 day ) Cycles 1 2 chemotherapy : °Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status disease . You must fast least 6 hour blood draw . Within 5 day end Cycle 2 chemotherapy : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status disease . You must fast least 6 hour blood draw . - You FDG-PET/CT scan check status disease . Some blood collect study may bank MD Anderson Lymphoma Tissue Bank MD Anderson Protocol 2005-0656 . You give separate consent form describe banking . Length Study : Your participation study End-of-Study Visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 21 day ( +/- 5 day ) start Cycle 2 chemotherapy , FDG-PET/CT scan check status disease . If scan show disease appear get good , fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) , core needle biopsy , and/or excisional biopsy check status disease . To collect FNA , small amount tissue withdrawn needle . To perform core needle biopsy , sample tissue remove use hollow core needle cut edge . To perform excisional biopsy , affect area completely remove cut . Follow-Up : Researchers may collect information medical record participation study check . This investigational study . FDG-PET/CT scan study perform use FDA-approved commercially available method . Up 50 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
