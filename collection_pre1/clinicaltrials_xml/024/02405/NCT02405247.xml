	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate clinical outcome 2nd line therapy NSCLC patient without T790M mutation , independently compare indirectly NSCLC patient T790M mutation T STAR non interventional study ( D5160R00001 ) . The patient population TAURAS study consist patient fail screen AURA3 ( D5160C00003 ) due T790M mutation detect use central cobas® EGFR Mutation Test ( Roche Molecular Systems ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TAURAS - T790 AURA ScreenFailure SOC Registry Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design observational prospective cohort study . The study plan enroll approximately 400 patient estimate 17 country . Patients recruit patient pool screen AZD9291 AURA3 randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) . Biopsy tissue consent already obtain patient use samples future research part AURA3 trial screening process . During RCT screen process , patient sign full consent participate AURA3 trial , tumour test part main screening . Data collect , notably medical history , co-medications , adverse event . Biopsy tissue collect assess T790M mutation status . All patient able enter TAURAS study regardless whether remain tissue . Biomarker analyse result historical tumour sample obtain part AURA3 screening process , accordance consent obtain within AURA3 trial protocol , link data collect TAURAS use part exploratory objective NIS . The primary objective NIS study NSCLC patient progress previous EGFR-TKI ( intervene chemotherapy ) harbour T790M mutation ( accord central analysis use Roche cobas® EGFR Mutation Test ) , : - To estimate overall survival - To estimate disease progression ( assess define physician ) - To estimate partial , complete , overall response rate line therapy ( assess define physician ) - To describe treatment pattern 2nd line beyond , include time treatment line therapy time subsequent therapy ( death ) - To describe health resource utilization pattern ( e.g. , hospitalization , emergency room visit ) - To capture patient report symptom , function health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) data use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire - Core 30 item ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) , European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire - Lung Cancer 13 item ( EORTC QLQ-LC13 ) - To capture health state utility use EQ-5D-5L questionnaire</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Provision informed consent patient nextofkin decease patient study entry , mandated/allowed local regulation 2 . Aged least 18 year . Patients Japan age least 20 year 3 . Patients consider ineligible entry AZD9291 AURA3 registration trial result tumour harbour T790M mutation , accord cobas EGFR test biopsy take follow late line therapy , central test lab participate D5160C00003 ( AURA3 ) study . 4 . Patients undertaken plan undertake 2ndline therapy screen failure AURA3 study . 1 . Treatment follow : Prior treatment one line systemic treatment advance disease prior fail screen assessment AURA3 . Major surgery ( exclude placement vascular access ) within 4 week prior fail screen assessment AURA3 . Palliative radiotherapy limit field radiation within 1 week prior enrolment , exception patient receive radiation 30 % bone marrow wide field radiation must complete within 4 week prior fail screen assessment AURA3.. 2 . Spinal cord compression brain metastasis unless asymptomatic , stable require steroid least 4 week prior fail screen assessment AURA3.. 3 . Involvement plan conduct study ( applies AstraZeneca staff staff study site ) . 4 . Judgment physician patient participate study patient unlikely comply study procedure , restriction requirement . 5 . Patients know enter interventional clinical study ( blind , randomize open label clinical study ) time enrolment study . However , inclusion study preclude participation clinical study enrolment . Patients participate clinical study enrolment study follow extent possible permit sponsor clinical study . 6 . Patients invalid unsuccessful T790M mutation test result screen AURA3 .</criteria>
