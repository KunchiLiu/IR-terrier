	<brief_summary>The lymphatic system one keystones fluid homeostasis interstitium . In analogy arterial systolic pressure , lymphatic pressure give u information function cardiovascular system fluid exchange . Actually , knowledge physiological parameter incomplete lack technology . Former measurement technique lymphatic pressure live healthy man invasive complex interpret . The lymphatic occlusion pressure clarify lymphedema treatment , concern pressure apply edematous tissue still base controversial concept . On one hand , technique Manual Lymphatic Drainage , sustain necessity apply low pressure order avoid squeeze superficial lymph vessel . On hand sustainer Intermittent Compression Therapy advocate necessity apply relatively high pressure obtain decongesting effect . These completely opposite opinion trigger u study lymphatic pressure thoroughly . Lymphofluoroscopy ( emerge image technique field lymphology ) use since 3 year promoter study visualize architecture superficial lymphatic network progression lymph inside highlight vessel . This technique use present ( prospective multicentric ) study observe effect pressure apply low limb displacement lymph , determine occlusion pressure lymphatic vessel . The investigator already study occlusion pressure superficial lymphatic vessel upper limb previous study . The investigator would like complete result low limb .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Injection contrast agent : Indocyanine Green ( ICG ) tricarbocyanine dye commonly use hepatic , cardiovascular , plastic surgery ophthalmology application . It usually inject intravenously dose comprise 0.1 0.5 mg/kg . After administration , ICG bind plasmatic protein , lipoproteins lipid , thereafter rapidly completely clear blood liver . ICG excite emits fluorescence near-infrared ( around 800 nm ) . In study , investigator suspend ICG 25 ml pure water subsequently dilute pure water reach final concentration 0.2 mg/ml . Each subject receive intradermal injection 0.5 ml dilute ICG ( e.i . 100µg ) , use hypodermic needle . The investigator standardize injection point inject ICG intradermally first interdigital space , accord injection method use lymphoscintigraphy . In way , investigator highlight systematically area superficial lymphatic network . Fluorescence images acquisition : After injection , injection site cover tape avoid camera oversaturation , avoid spread ICG skin undesirable fluorescent background image . To obtain fluorescence image leg lymphatic flow , near-infrared fluorescence imaging system use ( Photo Dynamic Eye , PDE camera Hamamatsu Photonics - Japan ) . The camera maintain fix position , 15 cm investigation field , hold system Noga Tools . The amplified analogic signal transform digital signal converter Terratec ( Model Grabster AV 450 MX ) transfer monitor , allow visualize lymphatic network lymph flow real-time . Images record dedicated external hard disk drive Iomega , model MDHDU . The session take place dark room , allow NIR fluorescence image acquisition . Specific manual lymphatic drainage , develop first author team NIRF feedback , perform immediately injection , whole experimental session order sure examine lymphatic vessel permanently contain lymph . The lymph propel hand operator injection point limit line draw skin 5 cm distal extremity transparent cuff . This optimized manual lymphatic drainage perform 3 minute order easily detect superficial lymphatic vessel distal region leg mark area interest . The MLD standardize first author experiment , compose continuous repeat sequence , execute distal proximal , 3 `` fill '' maneuver realize injection point , succeed 2 `` wash '' maneuver realize injection point limit line cuff . Then , two fluorescent line draw skin distance 50 mm order limit space reference . The cuff transparent sphygmomanometer place distal part leg , ankle . The sphygmomanometer connect pressure meter , indicate mm Mercury ( Testo® 510 Digital Manometer precision 0.1mmHg. ) . The PDE camera maintain perpendicularly major axis leg , level middle cuff . In order make sure observe lymphatic vessel contain lymph , fluorescent lymph propel experience hand operator injection point limit line draw skin 5 cm distal extremity transparent cuff . - First step : baseline record observe lymphatic flow un-inflated cuff . - Second step : cuff inflate 30mmHg , image record three lymph flow passage . Three independent observer present . They control three passage lymph order give consent go next pressure step . - Third step : The investigator increase inflated pressure step 10 mmHg record image increase ( wait three passage lymph step ) . The experiment complete soon investigator visually note complete stop lymph progression transparent cuff . At moment , pressure reduce 10mmHg order validate return lymph flow . After step , investigator observe record image lymphatic vessel injection point root limb .</detailed_description>
