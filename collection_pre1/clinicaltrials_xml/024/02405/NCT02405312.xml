	<detailed_description>This year , 90,000 Americans end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) die question legitimately raise whether terminal treatment location death adequately represent preference . These concern link failure part patient staff discuss prognosis share end-of-life ( EOL ) planning . The rate hospice use among patient die ESRD half national average one-quarter rate patient terminal cancer . In patient population meaningful EOL conversation occurs associate increased hospice referral improve quality die . Patients receive hemodialysis ( HD ) often desire rarely communicate staff prognosis , know little availability community hospice resource , complete advance directive . Nephrologists train conversation , although accustomed rely interdisciplinary team , unaccustomed collaborate community hospice . Our preliminary research begin use focus group , create validate first clinically useful HD prognostic tool , develop prototype Shared Decision Making Renal Supportive Care ( SDM-RSC ) . This novel multimodal intervention familiarize patient , family , dialysis staff community hospice resource , emphasize dialysis social work support , conveys information terminal care issue , encourage advance care planning . The propose study test central hypothesis EOL care improve rely patient stakeholder enhance SDM-RSC HD patient likely die . It test whether intervention target communication deficiency alter EOL outcome achieve goal matching patient preference terminal treatment . Specific Aims : 1 . To determine whether SDM-RSC impact use hospice service , location death , EOL planning . The RSC intervention employ HD clinic patient high quintile mortality . Hypothesis : SDM-RSC increase ) hospice use , b ) deaths home ( vs. institution ) , c ) completion advance directive . 2 . To determine effect SDM- RSC quality life/death caregiver satisfaction patient care last week life . Validated instrument reflect value priority patient caregiver collect interviewer . Hypothesis : SDM-RSC significantly improve quality life/death also increase caregiver satisfaction . The propose work address recommendation Renal Physician 's Association EOL care Institute Medicine patient-centered healthcare . The novel communication intervention relevant ESRD also high-mortality disorder . Scope Problem : A match patient goal care receive gold standard quality medical management . Meaningful end-of-life ( EOL ) conversation associate increased hospice referral , less aggressive expensive medical treatment , improve satisfaction part family . However , survey ESRD patient report less 10 % conversation EOL issue nephrologist previous year , 90 % endorse none physician ever discuss much time live . It know whether intervention target deficiencies communication terminal care plan improve EOL outcomes . This area neglect ESRD research , yet tremendous importance patient , family , policy-makers . Over 600,000 Americans ESRD cost society $ 42 billion year , patient age 75 constitute fast grow segment ESRD population United States . Up one-third elderly patient four comorbid chronic health condition , hemodialysis ( HD ) always substantially prolong life . This year , Wong associate report 49 % elderly long-term HD patient spend time ICU final month life , compare 24 % cancer patient , suggest intensity care EOL substantially high ESRD receive Medicare beneficiary life-limiting illness . According analysis United States Renal Data System , decision may important economic ramification . This figure demonstrate cost care last week life use hospice withdraw dialysis approximately half cost neither . In light substantial prevalence symptom , cost , high mortality rate , time reconsider care , especially EOL care , offer ESRD population advance age . Communication prognosis key step EOL planning , occur infrequently extremely late die process among patient ESRD . Most ESRD patient want learn EOL issue , accord Davison , value component informed prognosis , treatment option ( include withdrawal dialysis ) plan death . In two study , 95 % 97 % patient ESRD prefer give life-expectancy information—even prognosis poor—and patient specifically want physician disclose information without prompt . Nevertheless , nephrologists dialysis staff infrequently discuss EOL issue patient family , although repeatedly face difficult determination treatment option , include whether discontinue renal replacement therapy consider referral hospice service . Despite national guideline explicit recommendation Renal Physicians Association American Society Nephrology , patient family member surrogate decision maker often provide available information . This may help explain one-in-five die dialysis patient currently receive hospice care—about half national figure overall death United States one-fourth people die cancer . Both uncertainty regard individual prognosis lack training communicating limit EOL discussion nephrologists ESRD patient . Instruments identify individual undergo maintenance HD high risk death recently show reliable predictive model clinical use . Integrated prognostic model take account laboratory value , comorbidities , change comorbidity score time , functional status/fragility , quality life ( QOL ) , sometimes either patient 's clinician 's prediction survival . Drs . Cohen Germain develop practical reliable instrument available online ( http : //touchcalc.com/calculators/sq ) , free application mobile device increasingly cite potential value literature . In addition barrier provide reliable prognosis , communication highlight barrier qualitative study elderly ESRD patient nephrologists . Communication prognosis may essential ingredient acceptance life-limiting condition , completion advance directive , do-not-resuscitate order , delineation goal care . However , nephrologists dialysis staff lack training meaningfully participate complex much need conversation . In recent year , guideline become available assist medical personnel communicate 'bad news ' introducing hospice EOL resource patient family honest compassionate manner . Patients talk physician approach death satisfy care , also frequently request death take place home . These result consistent study , suggest EOL communication patient physician associate well outcomes , less expensive medical care , decrease anxiety depression part bereave survivor . We identify major barrier management dialysis patient : dearth communication staff patient prognosis EOL consideration . Without conversation , population continue receive overly demand expensive treatment , infrequent referral hospice service , diminish quality life death . The extensive preliminary work precede study , begin focus group involve patient family , allow u develop validate accurate prognostic instrument identification HD patient poor short-term survival expectancy . The multimodal SDM-RSC intervention take advantage exist interdisciplinary team approach bedrock HD practice , empowers social worker engage EOL communication patient love one . The SDM-RSC intervention design practical , adaptable exist staff , easily replicate dialysis facility throughout country . Additional involvement patient-partners two distinct section country greatly improve protocol . Renal supportive care hold promise become increasingly important desirable aspect patient-centered care ESRD . The principal element SDM-RSC include : identification high-mortality patient , initiate discussion family , share decision-making advance care plan establish agree level care , appropriate change emphasis curative palliative treatment , withdrawal dialysis referral hospice service . This study intend challenge current paradigm EOL care ESRD patient establish whether delivery prognostic information , encouragement advance directive , sensitive discussion terminal treatment option , e.g . hospice service , nephrologists dialysis social worker , together meaningfully alter last remain portion patient live care receive . The trial confront issue overuse—when appropriate service , e.g . HD , continue provide circumstance potential harm may exceed possible benefit . Furthermore , propose trial may significantly improve QOL patient provide opportunity high quality care . Brief Overview SDM-RSC Study Design : The study utilizes prospective intervention period retrospective control period dialysis unit , order balance efficacy , power , accuracy . The intervention implement unit level intend impact specific patient enrol study also patient receive care unit . The design avoid contamination effect inadvertent cross-overs would present individual participant randomization design . Because expect perception practice change among care provider design , e.g . cross-over design , would also unusable . Cluster randomization may also practical give variation unit practice pattern logistics involve conduct study sufficient number dialysis maintain internal validity . The design may open potential selection bias secular trend . Adjustments discuss data analysis section . This study test whether SDM-RSC intervention compare usual care improve EOL care , include : increased hospice use , enhance EOL planning , improve patient caregiver satisfaction . The multi-modal SDM-RSC intervention communicate prognosis face-to-face encounter , use algorithm-based social work intervention , provide hospice outreach . This study recruit subject 16 dialysis unit associate 2 clinical centers—Baystate-Tufts ( 8 ) , University New Mexico ( 8 ) . The study sample select use validate prognostic tool enrich pool patient high risk mortality likely benefit SDM-RSC intervention . Subjects recruit 6 month enrol subject treat follow least 18 month .</detailed_description>
