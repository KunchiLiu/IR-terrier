	<brief_title>Determine Prevalence Severity Asthma HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospectively clinically phenotype prevalence asthma HIV infect patient Duke ID Clinic - HIV infect asthmatic subject meet clinical definition asthma compare HIV uninfected asthma subject identify DAAAC HIV infect non-asthmatic subject . - Prospective immunological phenotyping - HIV-infected asthma subject prospectively identify clinically phenotyped compare HIV-uninfected asthma subject identify DAAAC HIV infect non-asthma subject . Regarding sample method probability sample : All sample HIV infect asthmatic patient , HIV uninfected asthmatic patient HIV infect non-asthmatics patient analyze . Retrospectively determine overall asthma prevalence severity among HIV-infected patient . Retrospective immunological phenotyping ( circulate cytokine ) HIV-infected patient utilize available specimen Duke HIV Specimen Biorepository - HIV-infected asthmatic subject meet asthma definition compare overall asthma prevalence U.S. population - HIV-infected asthma subject meet asthma definition compare match HIV-infected non-asthma subject</detailed_description>
