	<brief_title>A Multi-center Outcomes Clinical Study PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder Implant Humeral Head Resurfacing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design multi-center , nonrandomized , uncontrolled , unblinded , prospective clinical outcome investigation evaluate short , mid long term performance PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis humeral replacement . The PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis device configuration include humeral resurface CAP without cement . Patients select recruitment study base upon normally accept criterion primary shoulder resurface arthroplasty . The investigation conduct 10 International surgeon experience HRA . 387 subject PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis arthroplasty implant follow 10 year .</detailed_description>
