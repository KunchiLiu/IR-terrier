	<detailed_description>Vascular disease stroke often affect work memory , ability hold information mind order deal task , reading , conversation , problem-solving decision-making . Working memory deficit lead problem everyday activity , affect independence quality life . Thus , intervention improve work memory important optimal health outcome individual stroke . Currently , approach provide intervention work memory deficit limit intensive face-to-face rehabilitation session require trained therapist many week . Even one-on-one computerized training require significant health care resource , however , include supervision daily session train therapist , set-up program computer , teach patient use program , regular encouragement feedback maintain motivation , monitor progress , trouble-shooting difficulty . Thus , access intervention usually restrict patient currently hospital urban area , limit available community discharge , treated hospital rural setting . Thus , new approach increase accessibility intervention approach patient need . The investigator develop one method work memory training use computerize , game-like approach , ideal provide intensive , repetitive practice , feedback monitoring progress . While maximally effective dose yet identify , adaptive training practice normally provide 5 days/week 5-10 week . With intensity , computerized work memory train show improve cognitive ability range group ( e.g. , healthy young old adult , Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , stroke , schizophrenia ) benefit generalize cognitive ability maintain , least short term . The investigator propose develop evaluate internet-based intervention approach , use computerized working memory method show effective improve work memory several patient group , include stroke . The investigator develop refine website investigator use provide already available computerize game-like software program work memory training , conduct initial evaluation approach feasibility effectiveness pilot study involve clinical site Nova Scotia .</detailed_description>
