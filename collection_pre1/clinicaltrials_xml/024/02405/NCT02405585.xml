	<brief_summary>Unfortunately , despite best clinical effort breakthrough biotechnology , patient diagnose pancreatic cancer continue die rapid progression disease . One primary reason disease typically without symptom significant local and/or distant spread occur often beyond chance cure time diagnosis . The lack treatment substantially increase long term survival rate reflect poor outcomes associated disease , specifically time disease progression overall survival . However , another important part body look target therapy disease - immune system . Scientists clearly show pancreatic tumor cell produce number defective protein , express normal proteins highly uncharacteristic way , part cancer . In cancer , abnormality cause immune response cancer cell much way one respond infected tissue . In progressive cancer however , immune system fail effectively identify respond abnormality cancer cell attack destroyed reason yet fully understood . This clinical trial propose new way stimulate immune system recognize pancreatic cancer cell stimulate immune response destroys block growth cancer . This new method treatment help immune system pancreatic cancer patient `` identify '' cancerous tissue eliminate body . As example , patient certain disease may require organ transplant replace damage kidney heart . After receive transplant , patient receive special drug great danger immune response destroy `` reject '' transplant organ . This `` rejection '' occur immune system respond difference cell transplant organ immune system attack foreign tissue way would attack infected tissue . When difference foreign tissues patient 's body even large , difference organs different specie , rejection rapid , highly destructive , immunity generates longlasting . This call hyperacute rejection medicine use immunize patient protocol try harness response teach patient 's immune system fight pancreatic cancer body would learn reject transplant organ animal . To , Algenpantucel-L immunotherapy contain human pancreatic cancer cell contain mouse gene mark cancer cell foreign patient 's immune system . The immune system therefore attack cancer cell would attack truly foreign tissue , destroy much . Additionally , immune system stimulate identify difference ( aside mouse gene ) cancer cell normal human tissue foreign . This `` education '' immune system help treat patient pancreatic cancer cell already present treat patient believe show difference normal tissue modify pancreatic cancer cell product . Due similarity , immune system , `` educate '' Algenpantucel-L immunotherapy , identify patient 's cancer foreign attack . Historically , external beam radiation part treatment pancreatic cancer , surgical resection . Recent breakthrough technology allow intensive dos radiation deliver body great precision . These new , precise radiation treatment , call stereotactic body radiation , deliver intensive radiation locally advanced tumor employ treatment pancreatic cancer . Stereotactic body radiation may increase chance surgery successfully remove pancreatic cancer . In experimental study , patient give strong combination antitumor chemotherapy receive injection immunotherapy drug consist two type pancreatic cancer cell modify make easily recognize attack immune system . The investigator propose test new treatment paradigm along stereotactic body radiation patient borderline resectable pancreatic cancer demonstrate treatment combination therapy increase time tumor progress well overall survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol attempt treat pancreatic cancer use naturally occur barrier xenotransplantation human increase efficacy immunizing subject pancreatic cancer . In protocol , transfer murine alpha ( 1,3 ) galactosyltransferase [ alpha ( 1,3 ) GT ] gene immunotherapy component cell result cell surface expression alpha ( 1,3 ) galactosyl-epitopes ( alpha gal ) epitopes membrane glycoprotein glycolipids . These epitope major target hyperacute rejection response . This response occur organ transplant low animal donor specie primates result rapid destruction transplant tissue augment response transplant antigen , include antigen related alpha gal epitope . Human host pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibody think result chronic immunological stimulation due exposure alpha-gal epitope naturally express normal gut flora antibody may comprise 1 % serum IgG . Opsonization lysis immunotherapy component cell mediate antibody believed increase efficiency antigen process target vaccine component antigen present cell via Fc gamma receptor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A histological diagnosis adenocarcinoma pancreas confirm pathology . Patients must borderline resectable pancreatic cancer metastatic spread determine baseline diagnostic CT scan intravenous contrast ( MRI ) . CT perform accord define pancreas protocol triphasic crosssectional imaging thin slice . Optimal multiphase technique include noncontrast phase plus arterial , pancreatic parenchymal portal venous phase contrast enhancement thin cut ( 3mm ) throughout abdomen prefer . Studies must evaluate radiologist and/or surgeon deem borderline resectable define : 1 . Borderline resectable Tumors consider borderline resectable define follow : 2 . Venous involvement SMV/portal vein demonstrate tumor abutment impingement narrow lumen , encasement SMV/portal vein without encasement nearby artery , shortsegment venous occlusion result either tumor thrombus encasement suitable vessel proximal distal area vessel involvement , allow safe resection reconstruction 3 .
