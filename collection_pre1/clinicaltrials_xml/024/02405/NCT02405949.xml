	<brief_summary>Obesity directly relate increase risk diabetes mellitus , hypertension , dyslipidemia , cardiovascular disease , overall mortality . Weight loss effective decreasing risk reduce disease severity . Bariatric surgery effective therapy sustain weight loss type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) remission morbidly obese patient . But also significant number individual inappropriate response bariatric surgery . Two recent retrospective study assess role genetic load predictor response , result still unelucidated . The aim study ass whether selection genetic variant may allow u identify individual satisfactory response bariatric surgery term weight loss T2D remission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY FACTOR AS A PREDICTOR OF TYPE 2 DIABETES REMISSION AND WEIGHT LOSS AFTER BARIATRIC SURGERY</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A retrospective case-control study 100 woman underwent bariatric surgery ( Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass ) : 50 pacients diabetic surgery : 15 case less 40 % excess weight loss ( EWL ) 35 case 75 % EWL , match 50 non diabetic controles : 15 patient less 40 % EWL 35 75 % EWL one year . All individual analyze genetic score Nutri inCode . The predictive ability analyze discrimination ( area ROC curve ) , sensitivity specificity score calculate .</detailed_description>
