	<brief_summary>Obesity chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) major public health problem . In contrary observation general population , high body mass index pre-existing CKD associate low mortality . Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort ( CRIC ) ongoing observational study examine consequence CKD particular focus cardiovascular illness like myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) stroke . Among CRIC study participant , investigator propose obtain visceral subcutaneous adiposity physical fitness measure study association patient-centered outcome . This study help investigator understand independent combined effect visceral adiposity physical fitness cardiovascular disease , renal disease progression death among CKD . Further , identify mechanism could target reduce detrimental effect visceral adiposity kidney disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) major public health problem . Obesity independent relationship diabetes hypertension associate development progression kidney disease . However , high body mass index ( BMI ) pre-existing CKD associate low mortality ( obesity paradox ) . This may due inability BMI differentiate fat mass muscle mass , may opposite relationship cardiovascular disease death . Body fat distribution major factor metabolic health metabolic abnormality correlate well visceral subcutaneous adipose tissue . Further , high fitness level among high BMI associate low prevalence cardiovascular risk factor mortality might explain obesity paradox . Therefore , among Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort ( CRIC ) study participant , investigator propose ( ) examine whether visceral adiposity associate high incidence composite outcome ( i.e. , mortality , cardiovascular event , end stage renal disease , 50 % decline estimate glomerular filtration rate ) , ( b ) determine physical fitness modifies association adiposity outcome , ( c ) study whether visceral adiposity physical fitness associate altered adipokine profile , inflammation , insulin resistance , oxidative stress . The study propose enroll 526 patient vary degree kidney disease 7 clinical center involve CRIC study . Visceral adiposity measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) abdomen use standard protocol , physical fitness measure use 400 walk test routine CRIC study visit . Results study help Investigators understand independent combined effect visceral adiposity physical fitness cardiovascular disease kidney disease progression among CKD patient . This study also highlight potential pathway mediate relationship adiposity outcomes , become focus future therapeutic investigation CKD .</detailed_description>
