	<brief_summary>Hardened plaque locate carotid artery cause stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) . This type plaque link unstable free-floating thrombus ( FFT ) . FFT blood clot form blood vessel , high risk travel within bloodstream cause stroke . Physicians able see type plaque compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) FFT look similar stable type plaque require urgent treatment . Distinguishing plaque important affect choice urgency treatment patient receive . The researcher find promise visual marker CTA scan . The goal study determine visual marker see CTA scan help distinguish FFT plaque stable plaque .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atherosclerotic plaque origin internal carotid artery ( ICA ) cause TIA/stroke , well-visualized CT angiography ( CTA ) . Those plaque associate unstable free-floating thrombus ( FFT ) high risk embolization stroke . Unfortunately , FFT similar appearance stable ulcerated plaque CTA : appear intraluminal filling defect vary length morphology . Distinguishing entity critical affect choice urgency treatment ( antithrombotics vs revascularization ) . Using retrospective study , previously propose promising CTA image marker distinguish FFT stable ulcerated plaque . It hop data collect prospective study one day initiate multi-centre study . In prior research , propose reasonable `` gold standard '' FFT diagnosis . We follow patient present circular filling defect CTA ( doughnut sign ) suspicious either FFT ulcerate plaque serial CTAs medical therapy . Those diminished resolve antithrombotic treatment ( unfortunately `` resolve '' embolizing distally ) presume `` true FFT '' contrast remain unchanged . We assess performance variety image parameter differentiate FFT ulcerated plaque : test linear measurement , morphology , degree stenosis , well relevant clinical factor . These parameter measure neuroradiologists well innovative semi-automated shape analysis . Using retrospectively establish cohort , able derive 3.8 mm optimal cranial-caudal length threshold fill defect potentially help distinguish FFT plaque , 88 % sensitivity 86 % specificity . We prospectively identify consecutive patient present TIA/stroke within 72 hrs symptom onset ICA intraluminal filling defect CTA . We review image data measure cranial-caudal length fill defect . Patients receive follow-up CTA one week per current clinical standard care , defect still unresolved , third CTA repeat second week unresolved , fourth one month ( research ) . We measure cranial-caudal length fill defect time interval , blind previous measurement . Resolution fill defect point diagnostic FFT , whereas static appearance 1 month diagnostic ulcerated plaque . For pilot study , measure rate enrolment , adherence study protocol , attrition rate , proportion patient FFT . For exploratory objective , record treatment choice , dose , duration .</detailed_description>
