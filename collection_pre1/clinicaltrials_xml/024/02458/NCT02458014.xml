	<brief_title>Study Blinatumomab Patients With B-cell Lineage Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia With Positive Minimal Residual Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 6 week . If find eligible take part study , receive blinatumomab central venous catheter ( CVC ) continuously Weeks 1-4 cycle . A CVC sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . During Cycle 1 , blinatumomab infusion start hospital . You hospital 9 night check side effect . Your doctor decide leave hospital . Blinatumomab deliver small pump , carry whole time receive drug . You give shoulder belt bag hold pump infusion bag . You able wear regular clothes , walk around , perform daily living activity . You give instruction take shower activity . There thing , go swim . The study staff give information activity receive drug . You need come MD Anderson infusion bag change every 48 hour . The study staff let know need return clinic . You give standard drug , dexamethasone , help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . If severe side effect , study doctor may decide stop treatment permanently temporarily . If recover symptom improve , treatment may continue . If doctor think need , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) restart treatment . Study Visits : At begin every cycle , physical exam . One ( 1 ) time week Cycles 1-5 , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Week 6 Cycle 1 1 time every cycle , bone marrow biopsy/aspiration check status disease . Length Study : You may receive blinatumomab 5 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You participation study complete follow-up . Follow-Up : You call study staff ask health 1 time month 18 month participant enrol study . These call last 5-10 minute . This investigational study . Blinatumomab FDA approve commercially available treatment ALL . It consider investigational use blinatumomab treat ALL patient MRD . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
