	<brief_summary>The objective randomized control trial evaluate whether investigator modernize IMPACT intervention depression ( eIMPACT ) , deliver onset cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , reduce risk future CVD . Participants primary care patient depress history CVD . Half participant receive standard depression treatment primary care ( usual care ) , half receive one year eIMPACT , collaborative step care program include antidepressant computerized telephonic cognitive-behavioral therapy . To evaluate change CVD risk , investigator measure artery function use ultrasound 1-year treatment period . It hypothesize patient receive eIMPACT intervention great improvement artery function patient receive usual care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>eIMPACT Trial : Modernized Collaborative Care Reduce Excess CVD Risk Older Depressed Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) number one killer American men woman , economic burden substantial rise . Adults depression elevate risk CVD event poor CVD prognosis . Unfortunately , past trial depression treatment observe anticipated cardiovascular benefit . A novel explanation null result intervention trial , involved patient preexist CVD , deliver late natural history CVD . To begin evaluate hypothesis treat depression clinical CVD onset could reduce CVD risk , investigator conduct phase II randomize control trial 216 primary care patient age ≥ 50 year depressive disorder CVD risk factor clinical CVD . Patients randomize one year eIMPACT , modernize IMPACT intervention , usual primary care depression . eIMPACT collaborative step care intervention involve multidisciplinary team deliver evidenced-based depression treatment consistent patient preference . The investigator shave modernize intervention incorporate computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy deliver treatment component via telephone . Our central hypothesis eIMPACT improve endothelial dysfunction , consider barometer CVD risk , depress adult decrease depressive symptom , autonomic dysfunction , systemic inflammation , platelet activation . The investigator test central hypothesis carry specific aim : ( 1 ) determine whether eIMPACT reduces excess CVD risk depress patient ( primary outcome : endothelial dysfunction ; exploratory outcome : incident CVD event ) ( 2 ) examine candidate mechanism underlie effect eIMPACT CVD risk ( secondary outcome : depressive symptom , autonomic dysfunction , systemic inflammation , platelet activation ) . A positive trial would generate mechanistic rationale , efficacy evidence , effect size estimate need justify design multisite , event-driven , phase III trial confirm eIMPACT 's efficacy reduce CVD risk . Demonstrating depression treatment reduce CVD risk , primary expect outcome line research , would substantial positive impact . It would identify novel target ( depression ) CVD prevention effort , would equip provider new disseminable scalable tool ( eIMPACT ) simultaneously treat depression manage CVD risk large cohort high-risk patient . Collectively , change clinical practice translate reduce CVD morbidity , mortality , cost .</detailed_description>
