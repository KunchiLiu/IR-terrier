	<brief_summary>Purpose : Intracranial atherosclerosis common condition Korean population consist 25 % ischemic stroke etiology . American Stroke Association Korean Stroke Society recommend antiplatelet statin treatment intracranial atherosclerosis . Besides lower blood cholesterol level statin also stabilize atherosclerotic plaque eventually low risk ischemic stroke . However , little evidence resides effect statin treatment intracranial atherosclerosis . Recent advance high-tesla magnetic resonance imaging enables direct image intracranial atherosclerotic plaque assessment treatment efficacy statin stabilization intracranial atherosclerotic plaque become possible .</brief_summary>
