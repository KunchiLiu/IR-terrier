Randomization Initially , patient undergo simple randomization site www.randomization.com , result two group : 1 . Aerobic Training : Submitted protocol consist heating , aerobic training adequate heart rate slowdown ; 2 . Control Training : Heating Protocol speed low intensity ( heart rate next basal ) . Randomization perform examiner A , research participant ensure allocation concealment ( patient principal investigator aware group allocate ) . All woman evaluate ( group ) questionnaire spirometry start end exercise protocol . Every four week , patient submit revaluation questionnaire . The evaluation volunteer conduct examiner B ( principal investigator ) , blind randomization ; exercise protocol implementation responsibility examiner C , one know group patient belong . Corroborating double-blinding , evaluator perform statistical analysis data know group belong result . 3.2 . Evaluation - Socio-demographic questionnaire Prepared researcher characterize group , answer question identification history ( name , date valuation , telephone , address , date birth , age , weight , height , body mass index / BMI , profession , education , marital status , physical activity frequency , use medication , type medication , medication time ) . One minunciosa history regard use drug hold : type , frequency , duration treatment . - Identification impact migraine Will evaluate Migraine Disability Assessment Test ( MIDAS ) , contain five item measure amount day lose activity daily live ( ADLs ) professional ( AVPs ) due presence migraine last three month ; patient declares amount day , result sum score , rank degree disability individual ( 0-5 point : grade I / minimal disability ; 6-10 point : grade II / mild disability ; 11-20 point : grade III / moderate disability ; &gt; 20 point : grade IV / severe disability ) . - Clinical characteristic headache Will fill journal Headache , base criterion establish International Headache Society ( ICHD-III beta version , 2013 ) ; assess amount duration migraine attack period 30 day , pain intensity , symptom associate headache , medication use . - Investigation sleep quality The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , use measure subjective quality sleep ; consist 19 item divide seven component punctuate 0-3 ( total score 0-21 point , high score , bad quality sleep ) . Was adapt validated Brazilian population Bertolazi colleague ( 2011 ) , high reliability ( α Cronbach = 0.82 ) . - Quality life assessment Measured FIQ ( Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ) , consist 19 question divide 10 item : first item 10 sub-items four response option range 0-4 point ; second third item , patient choose option scale 0-7 ; , give score 0-10 response ( high score , great impact fibromyalgia quality life ) . Adapted validated Brazilian population . - Tracking symptom anxiety depression The presence depression assess Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , consist 21 question add maximum score 63 point ( level depression : 0-9 point = No ; 10-18 point = mild depression ; 19- 29 point = moderate depression ; &gt; 30 point = severe depression ) . It validate adapted Brazilian population , Cronbach 's alpha 0.81 . The Beck Anxiety ( BAI ) use identify classify anxiety ; consist 23 statement maximum score 63 ( 0-10 point : minimum Anxiety , 11-19 point : Light Anxiety , point 20-30 : moderate anxiety , &gt; 31 point : severe anxiety ) , validate adapted Brazilian population . - Evaluation level physical activity Proposed World Health Organization ( 1998 ) , International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) aim measure total physical activity level ( AFT ) energy expenditure ( METs.min-¹ ) . Will use short IPAQ ( version 8 ) , consist 4 question two sub-items ( b ) activity daily live , professional life activity practice walking ; frequency duration respond ( day hour / minute ) activity intensity ( moderate vigorous = 3.3-4 METs = 5.5 8 METs ) one week . From data obtain , sum frequency duration activity ( walk + moderate + vigorous intensity ) , result , classifies individual : sedentary ; irregularly active ; active active . This questionnaire validate adapted Brazilian population , excellent reproducibility ( ICC = 0.79 ) . - Assessment exercise tolerance Ergospirometry cardio-pulmonary function test assess precisely , cardio-respiratory capacity metabolic direct measurement maximum oxygen consumption determine maximum ventilatory threshold . He currently consider gold standard evaluation exercise tolerance provide non-invasive precise exercise intensity feature aerobic anaerobic metabolism ( anaerobic threshold - LA ) . It appropriate test prescription aerobic exercise intensity sedentary individual regular physical activity . Oxygen consumption ( VO2 max ) appear accurate indicator exercise capacity . The test perform treadmill , couple spirometer computer system climatically standardized environment . To minimize air leakage , employ use face mask tiny dead-space . The main parameter obtain test ventilatory threshold : anaerobic threshold ( AT ) respiratory compensation point , characterize aerobic anaerobic workout . The variable obtain test , clinical relevance : maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2 max ) , carbon dioxide release ( VCO 2 ) , rate gas exchange ( R ) , estimate lactate threshold , expire minute volume ( VE ) , ventilatory reserve ( RVE ) , ventilatory equivalent , end-expiratory pressure ( PEF ) , ventilatory pattern , arterial gas tension / oxyhemoglobin saturation , physiological dead space , electrocardiogram , heart rate , peripheral O2 saturation ( SpO2 ) blood pressure ( BP ) . The response cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPX ) obtain mean incremental protocol , consist progressive load increase predetermine time period . A typical incremental protocol provide : resting phase ( 2-3 minute ) , observe lack hyperventilation start test ; heat period zero charge ( 2-3 minute ) ; incrementing time ( 8-12 minute ) active period recovery load ( 3-6 minute possible ) . For intervention protocol , heart rate obtain anaerobic threshold , recommend proper intensity gain fitness great security compliance use . Generally , oxygen consumption level anaerobic threshold low patient . -Re-Reviews Initially , hold evaluation patient questionnaires cardiopulmonary stress test investigate exercise tolerance start exercise protocol ( review 1 ) . Every 4 week , patient group reassess re-application questionnaire : 4 week - review 2 ; 8 week : evaluation 3 . At end 12 week training , review 4 held , repetition questionnaire cardiopulmonary exercise testing . 3.3 . Intervention protocol The intervention protocol make examiner C , one blind research . After randomization evaluation , patient allocate one group : experimental control . After evaluation cardiorespiratory capacity patient , establish start parameter appropriate level physical activity base heart rate obtain anaerobic threshold ( ensure aerobic work ) . The experimental group follow follow protocol : performing heat 5 minute low speed treadmill ; heating , speed increase gradually patient reach proper heart rate aerobic training obtain cardiopulmonary exercise testing , maintain 20 minute perform aerobic workout ; complete , velocity decrease regain speed heating maintain 5 minute finish training . It envisage practice use FC ensure proper aerobic exercise 20-60 minute frequency 3-5 time per week effective increase functional capacity individual low fitness ( American College Sports Medicine - ACSM , 2006 ) . In control group , woman guide perform 10 minute heat treadmill low speed cause patient effort ( monitored Borg scale FC close basement ) . Both group follow 12 week , drive frequency 3 time per week . Heart rate saturation peripheral oxygen ( SpO2 ) continuously monitor use finger pulse oximeter course practice volunteer research ensure HR within establish group</detailed_description>
