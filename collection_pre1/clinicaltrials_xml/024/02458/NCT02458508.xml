	<detailed_description>Glioma frequent malignant primary brain tumor remain lethal disease dismal prognosis . Glioblastoma ( GBM ) account approximately 50 % glioma among tumor , malignant . GBM characterize high cellular density ample existence atypia , mitotic cell , pseudopalisading necrosis microvascular proliferation . The cell origin glioma still undefined , putative target cell include astrocyte , neural stem cell , oligodendrocyte precursor cell . Despite therapeutic advance record last decade , treatment GBM remain difficult nowadays available treatment curative attempt . Therefore , treatment patient malignant glioma still remain palliative . The current standard care patient newly diagnose GBM establish 2005 Stupp et al follow pivotal trial European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer/National Cancer Institute Canada Clinical Trials Group . The final result randomize phase III trial patient newly GBM reveal survival patient receive temozolomide radiotherapy GBM superior radiotherapy alone across clinical prognostic subgroup . On contrary , treatment recurrent GBM still controversy continue move target new therapeutic principle enrich standard care newly diagnose disease . After upfront therapy recurrence rate remain high ( ≈90 % ) Median overall survival ( OS ) 15-18 month clinical trial population , le 10 % patient alive 5 year . Melanocortins peptide well-recognized anti-inflammatory neuroprotective activity . Of five know melanocortin receptor ( MCRs ) , subtype 4 present astrocyte . Melanocortin receptor 4 ( MC4R ) express predominantly brain , although also detect adipose tissue , human skin melanocyte . MC4R show mediate melanocortin effect energy homeostasis , reproduction , inflammation , neuroprotection , recently , modulate astrocyte function . The signal pathway MC4R involve G protein-mediated activation adenylate cyclase increase cAMP production ; astrocyte also involve cAMP-protein kinase A ( PKA ) -cAMP response element bind protein mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase -1/2 activation . A recent study show melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( MSH ) induce neurogenesis hippocampus animal global ischemia effect mediate MC4R . In animal model focal cerebral ischemia , delay treatment α-MSH treatment Afamelanotide melanocortin receptor 3 agonist reduce neuron death . This protection correlate decreased tumor necrosis factor-α NO production , decrease expression pro-apoptotic Bax caspase-3 activation , also increase serum level interleukin-10 Bcl2 expression induce Afamelanotide . In cerebral ischemia , neuroprotection Afamelanotide also involve activation MC4R Bcl2 upregulation . Recently , experimental brain ischemia , treatment melanocortins act melanocortin receptor 4 induces neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation trigger canonicalWnt-3A/β-catenin Shh signal pathway . Caruso et al . demonstrate MC4R activation α-MSH protects astrocytes apoptosis . Melanocortins prevent astrocyte death decrease caspase-3 activity expression Bax increase expression Bcl2 . As melanocortins increase astrocyte survival , contribute neuroprotective effect . Moreover , anti-inflammatory action α-MSH , MCR agonist , reduce secretion mediator cytokine , NO , prostaglandins impairs leukocyte activation infiltration damage tissue . Moreover , proliferative effect α-MSH report 7-day-old cultured astrocyte . The Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) rs17782313 MC4R gene show effect Body Mass Index ( BMI ) different population ; direct role interaction Fat Mass Obesity Associated ( FTO ) MC4R gene polymorphism breast cancer development recently demonstrate . However , data currently available MC4R gene polymorphism gliomas relationship radiotherapy/chemotherapy without antiangiogenic drug . Given association MC4R antiinflammatory activity , neuroprotection , induction neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation brain hypoxia , prevention astrocyte apoptosis , aim study evaluate , retrospectively , possible prognostic/predictive role MC4R SNPs glioblastoma therapy . Our hypothesis SNPs could direct role modulation therapeutic effect radiotherapy , chemotherapy antiangiogenic drug glioblastoma could influence prognosis disease effect patient 's brain .</detailed_description>
