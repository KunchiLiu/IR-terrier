	<brief_summary>We collect prospectively retrospectively , patient ' demographic , pathological , surgical , therapeutic prognosis information database . After patient 's consent collect tumoural sample colorectal cancer resection . We able evaluate impact HSP110 , chaperon protein , prognosis . Other protein ( determine ) also study , .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BASE HSP110 : A New Therapeutic Target New Marker Prognosis Type MSI Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate importance HSP110DE9 prognostic marker colorectal cancer , analyze genotyping fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR / immunomarquage presence mutant large cohort patient ( 2000 patient colorectal cancer ) . All patient make general digestive surgery department Saint-Antoine hospital . Tumor fragment sample make tumor keep tumor bank Saint-Antoine hospital . All patient report objection use tumor fragment research purpose . A database build correlated tumor fragment . This project intend constitution clinical database include prognostic make discovery HSP110DE9 molecular biology discover marker correlate clinical data . In absence study subject , real knowledge prognostic impact mutant , provide effective computation . We therefore propose make database 2000 patient retrospectively prospectively obtain statistical result valid powerful .</detailed_description>
