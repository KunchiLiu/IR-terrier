	<detailed_description>Complete Decongestive Therapy ( CDT ) `` gold standard '' lymphedema care find efficacious numerous study . These study vary treatment protocol intensive phase I CDT dose range 2x/wk mean 7.5 wks 6x/wk plateau arm volume achieve . This variability research lend recommendation evidence-based protocol use CDT outpatient set . Although CDT back efficacy study , daily dose give patient base anecdotal rather evidence-based practice . Because traditional protocol develop `` longstanding experience , '' research necessary determine best dose intensive phase CDT . The purpose study investigate level dose intensive CDT phase promote best volume reduction increase upper extremity function breast cancer-related lymphedema patient population . This particular study answer : What dose produce best volumetric reduction upper extremity function intensive phase complete decongestive therapy outpatient breast cancer-related lymphedema 2x/wk 4wks 4x/wk 4 wks ?</detailed_description>
