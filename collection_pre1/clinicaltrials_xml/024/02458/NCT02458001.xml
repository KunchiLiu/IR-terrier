	<detailed_description>Many cancer patient sexual difficulty , gynaecologic cancer ( Gyn-Onc ) patient particularly vulnerable change sexual activity lack sexual desire sexual difficulty rate estimate 40 100 % . Women undergo range treatment ovarian , cervix , womb vulval cancer different combination surgery , chemotherapy , radiation . Some treatment deleterious effect woman 's internal external sex organ , surround tissue nerve , render menopausal . Following treatment woman report wide range difficulty include loss libido , dyspareunia , vaginal dryness , orgasmic difficulty . In addition , symptom burden gynaecologic cancer heavy many woman report pain , fatigue , change bowel function , urinary symptom include leakage , depression anxiety interact menopausal sexual difficulty . The major impact physical well-being sexual function note , well lack relationship extent treatment formal score sexual function . Unsurprisingly , woman treat gynaecologic cancer high risk emotional distress . One prevalence study find 23 % satisfy criterion major depressive disorder another find great depressive symptom gyn-onc patient breast , urology gastro intestinal cancer . It suggest depressive symptom relate high level sexual difficulty experienced treatment . Some suggest sexual self schema important moderator response , find positive sexual self schema associate frequent sexual activity , good sexual responsiveness , high global sexual satisfaction across disease sit confounders , suggest make woman resilient adverse sexual impact gynaecologic cancer . Despite sexual difficulty , many gynaecologic cancer survivor resume intercourse . Frequency intercourse one sample comparable available norm similarly age woman , longitudinal data show sexual satisfaction responsiveness significantly impair follow treatment . Patients report sexuality rarely address physician . It find conversation physician sexual effect cancer associate significantly low likelihood complex sexual morbidity among long-term survivor ; 62 % 221 participant report physician never initiate discussion sexuality cancer . Examining sexuality palliative care , find patient consider important talk sexuality face experience professional even though life expectancy short . Patients study opportunity . Moreover , patient still able maintain sufficient sexual activity , term quality quantity.Nursing researcher find cancer nurse likely focus technical aspect sexual recovery post treatment , example vaginal dilation , offer minimal advice opportunity disclosure sexual dysfunction , dissatisfaction partner relationship mood psychological difficulty . Clinical Nurse Specialists ( CNSs ) gynaecologic cancer acknowledge important role aspect care always feel confident competent ass manage patient psycho-sexual need , appropriate referral problematic . A recent review specific complaint cancer patient referral Sexual Health Program Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center find seek help painful intercourse ( 65 % ) , vaginal dryness ( 63 % ) , low sexual desire ( 46 % ) , orgasmic disorder ( 7 % ) . The first two partially manage current best treatment , i.e . topical estrogen , vaginal dilator lubricant .

A wide range non-controlled trial sexual therapy intervention report review across range intervention . All show small effect size , accompany patient satisfaction . A Cochrane Review RCTs psycho-sexual dysfunction woman treat gynaecologic cancer conclude , 'there insufficient evidence support refute use intervention psychosexual dysfunction gynaecologic cancer . ' Further , suggest future trial require multi-center RCTs outcome measure validate gynaecologic cancer patient . 'When consider intervention trial , investigator would suggest investigator focus intervention deliver exist member multidisciplinary team treat woman gynaecologic cancer . It likely measure , find effective , affordable capable integrate standard care . An international consensus outcome measure would greatly facilitate comparison intervention future . ' This study attempt address NHS use exist multi-disciplinary team deliver step care approach . This involve CNS deliver intervention step 1 step 2 major treatment delivery , small minority complex psychological issue treat step 3 level 4 practitioner patient access accord peer review.From evidence , often case woman affect gynaecologic cancer aware basic information sexual consequence gynaecologic cancer treatment , receive appropriate advice help recover sexual function , adapt change body relationship . It generally recognize two Cochrane review new intervention need sexual dysfunction gynaecological cancer need examine multi-center RCTs agree outcome measure . There sizable population problem address currently 1.8 million people England live beyond cancer , 2 million across UK whole . This number likely grow 3 % per year , reflect increase incidence cancer well survival rate . By 2030 likely around 3 million cancer survivor England . Since investigator ability develop suitable treatment , investigator duty explore . The current acceptance worth well-being , conversely cost depression , anxiety unwillingness engage healthcare system - potential long term effect patient group concern - driver research . Better awareness mental health issue depression general cancer patient plus great acceptance symptom cause treated addressed relevant . In addition work plan time awareness sexual health , evidence cancer user group , policy maker ) research openness discus matter medical need . The potential CNSs deliver intervention help consequence cancer treatment recognize UK Department Health yet little known CNS 's training supervisory need provide intervention psycho-sexual dysfunction work alongside psychologist . If care pathway exist address sexual dysfunction cancer currently unique individual unit ; provide evidence pathway well meet requirement population facilitate clinical application appropriate consistent practice . What need study develop intervention test facilitate best practice treatment sexual dysfunction relevant woman gynaecologic cancer centre . Trial objective : Aims : To establish whether woman treat gynaecologic cancer moderate severe sexual dysfunction willing participate randomize trial model adhere treatment 1 ) To indicate likely rate recruitment future evaluation SAFFRON intervention2 ) To pilot stepped care psycho-sexual intervention ( SAFFRON ) IAPT model3 ) To establish whether SAFFRON intervention acceptable patients4 ) To establish whether SAFFRON deliverable Gyn-Onc cancer center multidisciplinary team ; 5 ) To indicate appropriate outcome measure use large trial6 ) To inform estimate likely effect size , assist sample size calculation large trial Research question : To establish whether woman treat gynaecological cancer moderate severe sexual dysfunction willing participate randomize trial model adhere treatment 1 . Will woman agree randomize sexuality intervention ? 2 . Are different tumor site , treatment , cancer stage approach associate different rate uptake therapy/intervention recruitment trial ? 3 . Is step care operable within NHS system stand ? 4 . What likely effect three level intervention sexual function , mood self-esteem measured standard measure ? 5 . What rate attrition treatment modality ? Purpose Research ) Is possible improve sexual functioning woman treat gynaecological cancer within current clinical setting NHS gynaecological cancer treatment ? b ) Can suitable intervention develop evaluated feasibility trial ? c ) Can suitable intervention develop evaluated feasibility trial ? ) Is stepped approach acceptable practical ? e ) Can do within NHS setting ?</detailed_description>
