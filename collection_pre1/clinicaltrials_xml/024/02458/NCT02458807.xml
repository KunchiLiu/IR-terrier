	<brief_summary>The World Health Organisation predict lung disease World 's third large killer future . This research project look see whether concept `` home hospital '' use late gadget iPad technology , help patient stay well hospital . Portsmouth Hospitals Trust collaborate Company base United Kingdom ( UK ) develop test predict people lung disease , ; asthma , COPD bronchiectasis , regularly chest infection , become poorly another infection - form early warning system . The investigator hope test eventually able used patient home daily , help self-manage condition . The test measure whether bacteria present , sputum , quantity . This information use patient 's healthcare team consider provide treatment earlier , thus control infection sooner reduce patient 's symptoms patient stay home rather regularly admit hospital . Part `` early warning system '' develop UK Company include daily measurement number indicator health . These usually measure hospital General Practitioner , new device make simple enough everyone use home . The investigator include 30 participant , non-Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) chronic respiratory condition ask take daily measurement blood pressure , temperature , weight well heart lung work easy-to-use device . They also measure physically activity activity tracker report wellness whether take medication daily . Participants also ask collect sample sputum urine morning . Taking samples measurement take 5-15 minute day carry . The sputum urine test hospital record analyse , researcher learn happen well person condition fall sick need hospitalisation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study see whether concept `` home hospital '' use late gadget iPad technology , help patient stay well hospital . This trial single centre , non-randomised , mixed method study . A longitudinal cohort patient carers ( appropriate ) ask collect physiological , biological disease outcome data 6 month period . Both participant clinicians responsible patient care access longitudinal data information use make clinical decision . The laboratory sample also analyse blinded manner . These data analyse develop model predict onset exacerbation build self-monitoring system . Qualitative method use explore participant carer experience use technology perform daily self-monitoring assessment . The expected duration participant participation cohort six month , invitation complete self-administered questionnaire baseline inform face face semi-structured interview patient , without carer joint participant end follow-up period ( six month completion ) . A total 30 male female patient , age 18 recruit ; 20 patient chronically infect Pseudomonas Aeruginosa ( PA ) : â€¢ 10 asthma COPD 10 non-CF bronchiectasis 10 patient previously detect PA infection , infected Haemophilus influenza ( HI ) The investigator also recruit 10 patient plus/minus carers PA group , 5 patient plus/minus carers HI group qualitative part study . Methodology : Potential participant recruit exist asthma , COPD non-CF bronchiectasis local patient databases combination local laboratory result system clinical care team . Potential participant identify contacted member local research team also routine clinical care team invite attend specialist research recruitment clinic . At research clinic participant review clinical research fellow screen suitability study research team . Patients carers able view try self-monitoring device tablet-based IT system . Capacity operate system assess part screen . Those meet eligibility criterion give Participant Information Sheet and/or Carer information sheet participant wish carer assist use self-monitoring device tablet-based IT system daily . After adequate time consider ask question study , participant interested take part trial invite screen visit ask sign consent form . At screen visit , follow consent , participant ' lung function , blood pressure , oxygen level , height , weight BMI record general health question ask gain information medical history , current medication &amp; smoking status . Participants also ask complete set baseline questionnaire . Following screen visit ( 10 day ) , research nurse technician company ASEPTIKA deliver install study equipment participant home train participant use technology provide . This training visit take approximately 60 minute . Over period 6 month , participant require collect sputum urine sample daily store freezer provide , home . Participants trained sample collection screen visit member research team . The sample collect participant monthly member research team , participant bring sample hospital routine clinic appointment . Participants also need measure weight , blood pressure , oxygen level lung function wear activity monitor daily . These result , well questionnaire , record iPad sends data via 3G central database . The process take long 15 minute day . Participants clinicians blind continuous data duration study participant see value generate daily screen device . During study participant attend normal review medical team 3 6 month ( study completion ) usually involve lung function , sputum sample culture clinical review . These visit coincide short clinic visit see research team complete disease specific quality life questionnaire well note change treatment exacerbation . Participants carers also opportunity give additional consent take part qualitative interview , time main study consent seek . If consent attain , participant give extra questionnaire complete baseline include question expectation desire outcome study , worry , concern foreseen barrier compliance . Participants plus minus carers may select invited take part 1 semi-structured face-to-face interview , end study ( 6 month ) discuss think study also feel understand health . The interview either conducted participant ' home hospital , depend preference conduct research fellow throughout study allow consistency . The interview take approximately 45-60 minute depend participant/carer wish share . The interview terminate point participant/carer wish stop influence subsequent treatment . If participant admit hospital course study ask take along iPad self-monitoring device . If participant forget iPad member study team visit patient ward assist collect patient 's daily measurement study appropriate .</detailed_description>
