	<brief_summary>A significant percentage person diabetes fail properly take prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent ( OHA ) insulin . Non-adherence medication among diabetes patient associated poor health outcome include suboptimal glycemic control , diabetes-related complication , elevate health cost increase risk hospitalization mortality . Given substantial impact non-compliance health patient , prior study seek draw link medication adherence patient factor . Research show web-based intervention support patient ' medication-related knowledge , motivation skill effectively improve compliance . The purpose study evaluate impact patient web portal ( PWP ) -delivered medication adherence promotion intervention medication adherence glycemic control among patient type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . The intervention aim ( 1 ) increase self-reported adherence glucose lower agent ( GLAs ) ( 2 ) improve diabetes health outcome ( decrease HbA1c ) increase patient ' medication adherence-related knowledge , motivation skill . This research greatly enhance investigator ' understanding medicine compliance factor effectively improve adherence among high-risk patient diabetes . Knowledge gain work may inform future internet-based patient portal support disease management medication adherence broadly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Diabetes Medication Adherence Promotion Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>[ Background ] Medication non-adherence major public health issue patient diabetes . Approximately one third patient T2DM non-compliant diabetes medication . This problematic since suboptimal medication adherence show contribute inferior glycemic control , increase healthcare cost , hospitalization premature death . The aforementioned ramification nonadherence chronic medication product barrier diabetes self-care behavior include patient-related factor associate glycemic control . Dr. Chandra Osborn colleague identify targetable patient factor related patient ' medication-adherence relate knowledge ( e.g. , information medication purpose dosage ) , motivation ( e.g. , awareness medication benefit , social support adherence ) self-efficacy skill ( e.g. , ability remember dosage obtain refill ) . Said factor map onto Information-Motivation-Behavioral skill ( IMB ) model , inform effective adherence promotion intervention among individual chronic illness may utility promote medication adherence among patient T2DM . Intervention content inform validated theory medication adherence . Interventions seldom inform empirically establish theory . This problematic since theory-based intervention ( i.e. , intervention draw upon theory relevant target population ) proven effective atheoretical intervention . Few publish intervention study specifically address medication adherence among adult T2DM limit study , one ground theory . The study 's web-based intervention drive aforementioned IMB model adherence . This model incorporate central component theoretical model validate cross-sectional intervention research among patient acquire illness . Furthermore , recent empirical finding indicate IMB model 's success predict outcome target T2DM population . Thus , reasonable believe intervention ( i.e. , Diabetes MAP ) deliver IMB model-based content T2DM population may successfully improve medication compliance . Patient web portal ( PWP ) -delivered medication adherence promotion intervention practical tool relay health-related information resource . The magnitude consequence associate nonadherence chronic medication make web-based intervention imperative aim reduce impact barrier medication-taking practice . While medication adherence promotion intervention specifically design patient T2DM , literature suggest barrier medication adherence practice may reduce use interactive behavior change technology ( IBCT ) provide patient access resource , web tool health knowledge . While limitation patient website ( e.g. , poor design ) , usability web-based health intervention Diabetes MAP previously evaluate relation ease interaction accessibility individually-tailored component aim increase diabetes-related knowledge , motivation skill . This study aim leverage use Diabetes MAP help T2DM patient overcome barrier self-care promote medication adherence behavior improve diabetes outcome . Personality measure may moderate adherence effectiveness PWP-delivered intervention . In attempt broaden understanding self-care behavior , study implement additional instrument , Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ( MAAS ) , obtain personality measure mindfulness . Mindfulness psychological construct Buddhist origin draw together deliberate attention moment-to-moment occurrence cultivation knowledge , positive emotion ethical behavior . The MAAS validate 15-item scale design measure individual 's awareness ability attend occur present moment . Studies indicate quality mindfulness target MAAS related , predictive , certain self-regulation well-being construct . More specifically , mindfulness link increased subjective well-being , reduce psychological symptom reactivity , improve behavioral regulation , may correlate self-care behavior good decision make regard health ( i.e. , diet , exercise ) . Therefore , study participant high baseline level self-awareness may draw even great benefit use Diabetes MAP website therefore display great medication adherence lower A1c level score low MAAS . [ Study Objective/Aim ] The goal research evaluate web-based medication adherence promotion intervention use patient-specific information ( e.g. , diabetes medication , survey response ) deliver tailor content via Diabetes MAP website adult T2DM . The specific aim evaluate ability exist PWP-delivered medication adherence promotion intervention ( Diabetes MAP ) improve medication adherence glycemic control among patient participant T2DM . Investigators randomly allocate patient treatment ( website intervention intervention ) subsequently test website 's ability increase self-reported adherence glucose lower agent ( GLAs ) improve diabetes health outcome demonstrate lowered HbA1c level . [ Significance ] This project evaluate effect PWP-delivered medication adherence promotion intervention , Diabetes MAP , patient adherence glucose lower agent ( GLAs ) patient HbA1c . The study serve fill gap current literature focus power interactive individually-tailored technology support medication adherence subsequent health benefit arise T2DM patient properly adhere prescribe medical regimen . In addition reduce personal cost ( e.g. , hospitalization , mortality , healthcare fee ) , improve medication adherence among T2DM patient may benefit society reduce burden say individual ' health status place broad population . Ultimately , tool technique utilize data collect study provide insight future study may seek utilize web-based intervention reach impact medically afflicted individual .</detailed_description>
