	<detailed_description>Arthritis cause autoimmune disease cell pathogenesis tissue . This autoimmune inflammation often chronic disease cause irreversible articular damage . Rheumatoid arthritis often painful disable disease treatment turn ineffectual . Several available remedy treat disease totally keep patient check . The biological mechanism cause autoimmune inflammatory articular disease prove scientifically yet . Under normal condition , immune system adapts easily order protect body pathogenic bacteria virus without cause damage body 's cell . Autoimmune inflammatory disease displace balance way immune system distinguish `` self '' `` non-self '' . Different kinds cell involve chronic inflammation joint . Majority cell belong heart immune response , example T-lymphocytes , B-lymphocytes , macrophage , dendrites granulocyte . However , cell also involve , example synovial fibroblast endothelium . It important understand interaction cell order develop new medicinal product inflammatory articular disease . The big challenge conduction research inflammatory articular disease achieve evidence-based knowledge synovial tissue patient control group .</detailed_description>
