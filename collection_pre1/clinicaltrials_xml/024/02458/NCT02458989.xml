	<brief_title>Thyroid Cosmesis Study St. Paul 's Hospital , Vancouver BC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To evaluate difference thyroid cosmesis two different surgical incision method thyroidectomy : scalpel v electrocautery . Hypotheses : The investigator ' hypothesis difference cosmetic outcome surgical incision thyroidectomy either scalpel electrocautery . Justification : Very study address whether electrocautery produce cosmetically inferior surgical scar objective manner . While study comment briefly cosmesis electrocautery scar , one previous randomize clinical trial date evaluate cosmesis electrocautery scalpel incision use validated scar assessment tool . In study , Chau et al . find 6 month postoperatively difference objective cosmetic outcome subjective patient satisfaction two technique . This study relatively small trial , evaluate total 38 incision , thus large scale study would warrant . A advantage electrocautery scalpel decrease risk surgical injury . Approximately 17 % surgical sharp injury due scalpel blade , 2 % associate electrocautery device . As awareness concern blood born diseases increase , effort reduce sharp injury include replace scalpel electrocautery possible investigate . Objectives : Aim 1 : To compare cosmetic outcome surgical scar result scalpel electrocautery incision . Aim 2 : To determine rate wound infection associate technique . Aim 3 : To assess electrocautery incision associate difference postoperative pain compare incision make scalpel . Research Method : Patients already schedule thyroid surgery Dr. Sam Wiseman St. Paul 's Hospital Vancouver , BC , meet eligibility criterion study invited participate . After sign informed consent form , participant randomize either one two incision method , blind one receive . There two follow-up time point : one 6 month another 12 month postoperative . At time point research team send letter participant ask rate appearance surgical scar , rate wound infection degree post operative pain use Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale ( POSAS ) . They also ask take picture scar send back research team research team make similar assessment . Statistical Analysis : Once research team receive participant 's questionnaire photo , image surgical scar evaluate independent , trained , blind observer use Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale ( POSAS ) Vancouver Scar Scale ( VSS ) evaluate cosmesis surgical scar . The participant questionnaire also evaluate surgical team ass Objective : Aim # 3 . The study conclude 12 month follow-up assessment research team complete .</detailed_description>
