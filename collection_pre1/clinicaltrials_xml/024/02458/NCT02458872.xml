	<detailed_description>Hospital physiologic monitor alert clinician early sign physiologic deterioration , thus great potential life-saving . However , monitor generate frequent alarm , non-actionable . When clinicians become overburdened alarm , begin exhibit alarm fatigue : respond slowly alarm ignore alarm entirely . In protocol investigator outline method use evaluate impact safety huddle-based intervention physiologic monitor alarm rate use pragmatic , paired , cluster-randomized control trial intervention deliver unit level . This work consider quality improvement research , approach describe protocol field quality improvement . Currently , hospital data like number alarm patient generate available researcher software tool need interrogate record data monitor network . The goal proposal bring data safety huddle occur daily inpatient unit accessible format help team make informed decision monitor minimize potential harm alarm fatigue .</detailed_description>
