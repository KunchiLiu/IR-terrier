	<brief_summary>Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation ( PAVMs ) rare vascular condition affect lung . PAVMs lead low blood oxygen level , yet well tolerated patient . This study examine exercise capacity PAVM patient use formal cardiopulmonary exercise test perform stationary bicycle , whether affected presence concurrent airflow obstruction , due asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Evaluate Pulmonary AVMs With Without Airflow Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well know lung site oxygen enters blood stream , diffuse alveolar air sacs pulmonary capillary . This newly oxygenate blood carry heart pulmonary vein , pass systemic circulation provide oxygen tissue . Patients pulmonary arteriovenous malformation ( PAVMs ) abnormal vascular connection pulmonary artery pulmonary vein lung . Blood flow PAVMs therefore bypass oxygenation site pulmonary capillary . Low blood oxygen level ( hypoxemia ) frequent PAVM patient breathlessness ( dyspnea ) . The investigator show dyspnea common present complaint large UK series , little correlation severity dyspnea PAVM patient , blood oxygen level . In study investigator address question `` Do PAVM patient lower exercise tolerance concurrent airflow obstruction ? '' The primary outcome measure total body oxygen consumption mls/min/kg , peak exercise ( V [ dot ] O2 peak ( also know `` VO2 max '' ) ) . The investigator address first perform standardise cardiopulmonary exercise testing , use clinic previous study ( 11/H0803/9 ) , age sex match patient PAVMs . 30 recruit airflow obstruction , 30 without airflow obstruction . Physiological parameter compare , test null hypothesis impact exercise PAVM patient ' cardiopulmonary system differ accord presence absence airflow obstruction . Cellular molecular method use dissect mechanistic pathway .</detailed_description>
