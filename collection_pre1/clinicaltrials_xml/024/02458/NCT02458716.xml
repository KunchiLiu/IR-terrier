	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect cytoreductive prostatectomy treat patient newly diagnose prostate cancer spread primary site place body . Cytoreductive prostatectomy type surgery remove prostate much tumor possible . When combined hormone therapy , robotic assist radical prostatectomy ( RARP ) conventional open retropubic radical prostatectomy ( RRP ) may prolong survival patient prostate cancer spread .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety feasibility cytoreductive prostatectomy ( remove much primary cancer possible ) men newly diagnose clinical T1-3N1M0 T1-3N0M1a-b prostate cancer ( herein , collectively refer metastatic prostate cancer ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Time prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) nadir castration resistance follow cytoreductive prostatectomy subsequent standard systemic therapy , androgen deprivation . OUTLINE : Patients undergo RARP conventional open RRP . Immediately follow surgery , patient receive standard systemic androgen deprivation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 90 day 3 year .</detailed_description>
