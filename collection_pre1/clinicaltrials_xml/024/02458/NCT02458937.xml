	<brief_summary>Although uncommon general pediatric population , osteonecrosis ( ON ) prevalent child adolescent cancer , particularly among chronic exposure glucocorticoid among undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Patients hematologic disease also risk develop ON . Hip Core Decompression ( HCD ) widely use surgical procedure several study report positive result ; however , subject criticism limit sample size absence appropriate functional outcome measure . The objective pilot study observe collect information several functional outcome measure assess Hip Core Decompression ( HCD ) potentially improve functional outcome child , adolescent young adult osteonecrosis . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To describe functional outcome child , adolescent , young adult osteonecrosis femoral head follow hip core decompression surgery . Parameters assess include pain , functional mobility , endurance , quality life , gait pattern pre-operatively post-operatively time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Outcomes Following Hip Core Decompression Younger Participants With Osteonecrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip core decompression ( HCD ) do part study . Rather , patient undergo HCD St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) observe functional outcome follow procedure . HCD consider excellent surgical option consider multiple issue among population , include young age , natural progression osteonecrosis femoral head collapse , limited life expectancy prosthetic technology currently available total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) , patient quality life . This study seek describe functional outcome quality gait follow HCD pediatric population osteonecrosis . The result study provide valuable information functional limitation within population pre- post-operatively . For research participant observations outcome measure interest collect 5 time point : pre-operatively ( baseline measure ) , post-operatively 6 week , 12 week , 6 month 1 year . These time point allow comparison pre- post-operative outcome determine outcomes improve follow surgery , outcome continue improve time . This study also provide foundation future development treatment program design target identify limitation specific population .</detailed_description>
