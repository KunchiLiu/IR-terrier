	<brief_summary>The overall objective project determine efficacy tolerability TMS mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( mTBI ) PTSD symptoms correlate treatment response anatomical biological factor unique service member ( SM ) . Exploratory work do look neuronal biological change may occur course TMS treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) Treat mTBI PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study : 1 . To assess change Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire ( RPQ ) PTSD Check Listâ€”Civilian Version ( PCL-C ) administer pre-treatment , bi-weekly ( week 2 , 4 , 6 ) 7 week treatment course , monthly 3 month follow treatment . Hypothesis : The addition high frequency leave pre-frontal low frequency right pre-frontal cortical stimulation improve symptom report RPQ PCL-C service member mTBI PTSD symptom compare sham treatment . 2 . To assess tolerability TMS subject measure side effect active TMS compare sham treatment . Hypothesis : TMS prove safe tolerable service member mTBI PTSD . The secondary objective study : 1 . To assess whether TMS result improvement mood measure Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report ( QIDS-SR ) , general life functioning ( physical , cognitive , emotional , behavioral , social problem ) measure Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory - military ( MPAI-m ) , life satisfaction measure Satisfaction With Life Scale ( SWLS ) , suicidality measure Beck Scale Suicidal Ideation ( BSS ) . Hypothesis : TMS result improvement mood , general life functioning , life satisfaction , well reduction suicidality . 2 . To assess durability improvement realize TMS course three month follow conclusion session . Hypothesis : The improvement realize 7 week TMS prove stable , show effect 3 month conclusion active treatment . 3 . To assess structural neuronal change course active vs. sham TMS measure MRI . Hypothesis 1 : Analysis structural MRI ( 3D T1-weighted ) reveal increase volume hippocampus anterior cingulate cortex service member improve PTSD symptom ( measure PCL-C ) . Hypothesis 2 : Microstructural MRI ( DTI ) reveal FA increase corpus callosum uncinated fasciculus service member improve measure mTBI ( i.e. , Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire ) . 4 . To assess metabolic neuronal change occur course active vs. sham TMS measure PET . Hypothesis 1 : TMS result increase glucose uptake ipsilateral contralateral cerebral hemisphere show significant improvement symptomatic measure TBI ( i.e . RPQ MPAI-m ) . Hypothesis 2 : TMS result decrease glucose uptake dorsal anterior cingulate/mid cingulate cortex ( dACC/MCC ) bilateral amygdala service member significant improvement symptomatic measure PTSD mood ( i.e . PTSD Checklist QIDS-SR ) . 5 . To examine mechanism action TMS look metabolic change occur TMS session . Hypothesis : There increase glucose uptake leave prefrontal cortex decrease glucose uptake right prefrontal cortex immediately active TMS compare sham . 6 . Exploratory : To assess biological change result TMS therapy determine biomarkers relate change PTSD symptom . 7 . Exploratory : To examine single gene polymorphism ( SNPs ) serotonin gene may relate TMS response symptom change .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Military health care beneficiary enrollment ( loss benefit require separation study ) . 2 . Over age 18 year . 3 . Presence mTBI ( base standard Veterans Affairs ( VA ) / Department Defense ( DoD ) criterion ) . 4 . Presence PTSD symptom ( PCL score 30 ) . 1 . Evidence moderate severe TBI ( base standard VA/DoD criterion ) . Incidental neuroimaging finding may may relate trauma ( e.g . white matter hyperintensities structural MRI ) sufficient identify subject moderate TBI severity marker fall mild TBI range . 2 . History seizure , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , current dependence psychoactive substance ( ) . 3 . History severe recent heart disease . 4 . Vascular , traumatic , tumoral , infectious , metabolic lesion brain . 5 . Use medication potentially low seizure threshold without concomitant administration anticonvulsant drug may protect seizure occurrence . 6 . Not suitable candidate study determine PI . 7 . Pregnancy plan become pregnant course study ( determine via urinepregnancy test ) . 8 . Presence metallic hardware close contact discharge coil ( e.g . cochlear implant , internal pulse generator ) . 9 . Presence implant brain electrode ( cortical deepbrain electrode ) . 10 . MRI portion : Presence metal fragment device ( cardiac pacemaker , neural stimulator , etc . ) , determine radiologist contraindicate MRI ( 3 Tesla ) . Also , presence metal ( dental brace ) cause significant degradation MRI signal .</criteria>
