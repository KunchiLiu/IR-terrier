	<brief_summary>The objective randomize control trial investigate efficacy adjunct positive airway pressure ( PAP ) nebulizer device know `` AccuPAP '' treatment moderate-severity acute asthma exacerbation child age 6 - 17 year comparison institutional standard continuous dual-therapy nebulizer treatment . The investigator main goal , specifically , determine additional positive airway pressure provide AccuPAP device use treat child moderate-severity asthma exacerbation provide optimal delivery bronchodilator therapy compare institutional standard protocol nebulizer delivery mask employ use positive airway pressure medication delivery . The investigator determine change study-validated Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score ( AAIRS ) consider statistically significant patient 2 point great first treatment complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial AccuPAP Device Versus Standard Nebulizer Therapy Acute Asthma Exacerbation Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently standard care acute asthma exacerbation child involve immediate administration inhale short act beta agonist ( SABA ) , commonly Albuterol , pair parasympatholytic ( Ipratropium ) administer via continuous nebulizer . Additionally , course oral intravenous systemic corticosteroid methylprednisolone decadron also give combat acute airway inflammation . Medical provider may also initiate use respiratory support device range supplemental oxygen deliver via nasal cannula ( NC ) escalate use Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure ( BiPAP ) endotracheal intubation order increase delivery medication distal airway . Because asthma common chronic disease childhood , ongoing study many front undertaken minimize morbidity , shorten hospitalization duration rapidly reduce patient 's level respiratory distress . When nebulized medication deliver patient active bronchospasm might immediately deliver small bronchiole terminal airway affect bronchospasm cause air trap poor gas exchange . Current modalities rely dilation large airway first thus allow medication diffuse passively small airway dilation occur bronchial tree . Medication delivery passive dependent upon progressive relaxation large airway reach small airway ultimate goal nebulized therapy . The critical pressure require medication reach obstruct airways keep stented open high otherwise healthy individual due natural consequence airway remodel see asthmatic include narrow diameter airway , increase atelectasis hypoventilated area , overall increase ventilation-perfusion ( V/Q ) mismatch . The concomitant process mucous plug also commonly see asthma complicates efficient distribution medication thoracic cross section . However , application positive pressure patient obstructive airway diseases asthma potential increase air-trapping , dynamic hyperinflation , auto-peep , turn , aggravate ventilation-perfusion mismatch , potential delay clinical improvement . With consideration , seek determine physiologic benefit propose improved bronchodilator delivery use add positive airway pressure ( ie , active delivery medication ) sufficient magnitude provide overall benefit patient acute asthma exacerbation . The investigator propose test hypothesis follow aim : To conduct single-blinded ( clinical team ) , randomize clinical trial determine efficacy AccuPAP device comparison standard nebulizer decrease acute exacerbation severity measure Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score ( AAIRS ) , objective validate asthma score system , 0 , 1 2 hour initiation treatment . Secondary outcome include Emergency Department ( ED ) length-of-stay ( LOS ) , general pediatrics floor hospitalization rate , Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) admission rate , number patient improve AccuPAP , rate relapse within 24 hour discharge ED . The investigator propose outcome study finding potential shorten hospital stay duration cost efficient also decrease burden disease process patient implement improved medication delivery strategy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Investigators enroll child age 6 17 year ( inclusive ) previous diagnosis asthma present acute exacerbation Pediatric Emergency Department . Patients evaluate use Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score ( AAIRS ) validate Vanderbilt University Medical Center currently standard care triaging patient asthma . An included patient 's severity current exacerbation must qualify use AAIRS fall moderate category 7 11 point . Patients receive nebulized bronchodilator medication either refer facility home include . Patients present refer facility Primary Care Physician ( PCP ) receive systemic corticosteroid ( SCS ) within one hour initial AAIRS scoring also include . Exclusion criterion include follow : medical condition contribute respiratory distress ( e.g. , pneumonia , cystic fibrosis , anaphylaxis ) , developmental delay impedance follow basic AccuPAP use instruction , condition preclude patient receive betaagonist therapy ( ie predisposition Supraventricular Tachycardia ) . Patients history spontaneous pneumothorax , recent facial , oral skull surgery/trauma , history esophageal surgery , know suspect tympanic membrane rupture middle ear pathology , acute sinusitis , epistaxis , active hemoptysis nausea exclude contraindication AccuPAP use . Patients receive additional adjunctive therapy beyond repeat SABA atrovent nebulizer receive SCS great 1 hour prior initial ED evaluation , receive intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion , subcutaneous terbutaline epinephrine exclude . Those patient whose parent require translator consent also exclude ( ie , exclusively Spanish speak nonEnglish speaking families/patients ) . The justification exclusion patient respiratory distress often need rapid initiation treatment delay may cause coordination effort require order obtain translator study consent explanation may delay care patient result adverse outcome may potentially result harm .</criteria>
