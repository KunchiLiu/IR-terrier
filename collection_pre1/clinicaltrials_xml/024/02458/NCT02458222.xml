	<detailed_description>Aphasia language impairment experience one third stroke patient . This often devastating condition treat speech language therapist ( SLTs ) . There evidence language game deliver right intensity efficacious mean improve communication people post stroke aphasia . However , unclear mechanism language facilitation use game work best . This study provide evidence `` active ingredient '' game , together measure efficacy , feasibility enjoyment compare standard aphasia therapy . Participants moderate-severe difficulty play picture name game , involve self-cuing use gesture circumlocution . Those mild difficulty play story-telling game , use similar self-cuing technique . Change language performance measure compare achieved participant follow episode standard aphasia therapy local SLT ( i.e . normal care ) . This study build grow evidence base efficacy therapeutic language game post stroke aphasia . In today 's resource-constrained National Health Service , SLTs continually search cost-effective , innovative way deliver therapy . Language game base sound neuro-scientific principle potential deliver improvement functional communication mean enjoyable motivate activity , moreover do cost effectively . Improvements demonstrate acute chronic stage stroke . A number factor say contribute outcome achieve : intensity training , behavioural relevance focus use capacity . This study intend explore depth specific behaviour occur spontaneously prompt facilitate language . The aim uncover `` active ingredient '' , thereby ensure participant benefit maximally therapeutic language game . This study contribute search cost effective treatment post-stroke aphasia , offer ease flexibility delivery , enjoyable motivating patient , work .</detailed_description>
