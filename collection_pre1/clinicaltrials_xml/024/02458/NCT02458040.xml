	<detailed_description>Personalized medicine consist differentially treat patient base individual characteristic ( mainly genetics ) . It promising area cancer research cancer care . The label 140 FDA- approve drug mention biomarker , majority indicate oncology . However , also suggest hope personalize medicine match evidence . Indeed , threat genetic biomarkers use without evidence use translate improved outcome patient , use biomarkers need thorough validation . In previous work investigator show mention pharmacogenomic biomarker drug label different meaning depend drug , oncology high proportion require recommend genetic testing compare therapeutic area . Hence , investigator include drug-biomarker pair ( ) require recommend genetic testing , ( ii ) biomarker-based indication ( iii ) least one indication oncology .</detailed_description>
