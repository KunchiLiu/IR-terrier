	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease common cause death world Argentina , well cause disability loss work capacity adult . Treatment various form serious disease acute ischemic event heart failure support scientific study allow markedly reduction disability mortality . Access diagnostic therapeutic strategy require proper coordination health system far exceed role specialist . Given frequency disease , essential information prevalence treatment , various barrier access diagnosis appropriate treatment . Both basic knowledge evaluate relevance effectiveness corrective action record pathology require , information accurate enough enable adoption public policy , adjust national need . Scientific societies cardiovascular field , Argentine Society Cardiology Argentine Federation Cardiology , long history register educational program improve cardiovascular care . However , task limit institution academic program probably reach majority population . A national survey high prevalence cardiovascular disease , start acute myocardial infarction ST segment elevation , together authority National Ministry Health , would put Argentina level develop country subject . Knowledge general local barrier allow rapid implementation corrective measure evaluation impact permanent record . Improving quality cardiovascular patient care , optimize adherence standard diagnosis treatment achieve different path self-knowledge institution level performance dissemination coordination measure , generate systematic referral care network , diagnostic support system telemedicine , others assess globally regionally accord identify problem . Networking also enable implementation initiative result increase quality care generate epidemiological research project enhance patient care outcome . In conclusion , allow know problem depth adopt measure improve quality care reduce morbidity mortality . The main objective survey register national level , broad possible way try reach `` universe '' care disease Argentina , aspects clinical , delay , treatment schedule result , sufficient information quickly allow adoption policy improve quality care subsequent control . Its fulfilment arises stage : 1 . Develop national survey myocardial infarction ST segment elevation , aim characterization current evolution possible barrier improve . 2 . Based result , configure advisory group public policy area suggest global regional measure . 3 . Upon completion survey , consolidation permanent network cardiovascular disease registry assess impact public policy progressive adjustment Federal Cardiovascular Disease Registry A national survey AMI ST segment elevation admit intensive care area across country take place period 3 consecutive month centre . The inclusion criterion : - Patients admit AMI ST-segment elevation . - AMI evolve new Q wave less 36 hour evolution . - Suspected inferoposterior AMI ( horizontal ST depression V1 V3 , suggestive acute circumflex coronary artery occlusion ) . - New presume new left bundle branch block . Exclusion criterion : - Acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation non-Q AMI - Myocardial infarction 36 hour evolution . Data patient characteristic ( age , gender , risk factor , history , comorbidities ) , clinical condition ( infarct location , Killip admission , duration symptom ) , treatment ( antiplatelet drug , reperfusion therapy , adjuvant treatment ) in-hospital ( heart failure , post-infarction angina , shock , death ) 30-day evolution collect . Emphasis place delay effective treatment . 30 day follow-up do telephone person centre investigator central coordinate committee . The data collection take place electronic record specially design , via web , allow constant monitoring input data . The survey data verify confront source document least 30 % patient include survey . The data analysis conduct committee representative organize researcher Scientific Societies Ministry Health , present relevant scientific meeting publish journal Societies .</detailed_description>
