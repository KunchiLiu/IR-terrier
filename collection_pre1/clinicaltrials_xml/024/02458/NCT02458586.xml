	<brief_summary>Epidemiological data study animal model suggest , polyunsatured fatty acid ( PUFA ) rather mono-unsatured fatty acid ( MUFA ) associate low hepatic lipid content ( HCL ) may facilitate decrease HCL case non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . The investigator therefore conduct interventional trial subject normal glucose metabolism , increase HCL , fulfil criterion NAFLD . The study compare two dietary intervention parallel design , one contain mainly PUFA ( canola oil ) , one containing MUFA ( olive oil ) . The intervention 8 week accomodated dietary counseling . Metabolic outcome variable assess MR spectroscopy ( liver fat ) euglycemic hepatic clamp ( glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epidemiological data study animal model suggest , polyunsatured fatty acid ( PUFA ) rather mono-unsatured fatty acid ( MUFA ) associate low hepatic lipid content ( HCL ) may facilitate decrease HCL case non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . A typical source PUFAs fish certain plant oil , source almost pure MUFAs olive oil . The investigator therefore conduct interventional trial subject normal glucose metabolism , increase HCL , fulfil criterion NAFLD . The investigation focus male participant avoid sex-related difference result . The study compare two isocaloric dietary intervention parallel design , one contain mainly PUFA ( canola oil ) , one containing MUFA ( olive oil ) . The intervention 8 week accomodated dietary counseling ( 4 session ) . Metabolic outcome variable assess MR spectroscopy ( liver fat ) , anthropometry ( check stable weight body composition ) euglycemic hepatic clamp ( glucose metabolism/insulin sensitivity ) .</detailed_description>
