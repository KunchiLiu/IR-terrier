	<brief_summary>Despite many previous study , whether anesthetic technique significantly affect overall patient outcome , morbidity mortality elderly hip fracture patient controversial . Due old age , poor patient condition emergent clinical setting , patient undergo surgical procedure hip fracture management often subject poor postoperative outcome high mortality rate . While many study report regional anesthesia lead improved postoperative outcome hip fracture surgery , others conclude otherwise . Moreover , majority previous study retrospective cohort systemic review , need randomize clinical trial provide high quality evidence . This study aim compare patient outcome three different anesthetic technique elderly patient undergo surgery hip fracture management evaluate proinflammatory cytokine , chemistry lab test clinical outcome general anesthesia either desflurane propofol-based TIVA spinal anesthesia bupivacaine .</brief_summary>
