	<detailed_description>Pancreatic blood flow perfusion difficult quantify due complex vascular supply organ retroperitoneal location , adjacent abdominal aorta . The pancreas supplied superior gastroduodenal artery celiac plexus , branch hepatic splenic artery , originate celiac plexus , inferior gastroduodenal artery , originate superior mesenteric artery . Identifying change flow vessel good spatial temporal resolution challenge important understand many chronic condition pancreas . Chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) inflammatory condition pancreas lead irreversible damage tissue . It increase incidence nation , relate rise alcohol consumption improve diagnostic technique . In Europe incidence approximately 6-7/100,000 population . 73-91 % patient affected male average age 49-60yrs . Patients affect CP high morbidity , diabetes chronic abdominal and/or post-prandial pain 80-90 % , require frequent hospital admission , control-drug prescription intervention specialist hospital service . However mechanisms chronic post-prandial pain CP patient well understood , tissue ischaemia , inflammation neurological change propose . These mechanism may inter-related pancreatic inflammation neurochemical change , increase substance P , produce vasoconstriction , reduce pancreatic perfusion worsen ischaemia intra-pancreatic nerve ( 3 ) . A great understanding ischaemic inflammatory mechanism behind pain CP , would greatly enhance development treatment debilitate condition . There study pancreatic tissue perfusion human , study assess perfusion use invasive technique endoscopic laparoscopic measurement hydrogen gas clearance method . Although method demonstrate decreased resting blood flow little response secretin stimulation CP patient compare healthy control , technique highly invasive , time consume expensive cause participant significant morbidity . This lead several non-invasive technique include infusion oxygen-15 water positron emission tomography ( PET ) , contrast-material-enhanced trans-abdominal ultrasound ( US ) contrast-enhanced dynamic computer tomography ( CT ) . However technique involve infusion exogenous marker detect change flow rate often require radiation exposure operator dependant give poor spatial temporal resolution , limit usefulness study . MRI attractive alternative assessment pancreatic perfusion , provide good spatial temporal resolution radiation exposure . Two method use , Contrast-Enhanced ( CE ) MRI Arterial Spin Labelling ( ASL ) technique . ASL provide tool quantitative assessment tissue perfusion without need contrast administration . Contrast-enhanced MRI use gadodiamide use explore change pancreatic perfusion secretin stimulation . This study 10 healthy volunteer demonstrate rest high blood flow within body tail pancreas , compare head . With secretin stimulation significant increase perfusion region pancreas . ASL technique , require exogenous contrast agent , two previous study measure pancreatic perfusion ASL , one explore pancreatic exocrine function type 1 diabetic . A recent study Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre pancreatic perfusion measurement use ASL baseline intravenous secretin stimulation standardise MRI technique measure pancreatic perfusion . There study use MRI ASL measure pancreatic perfusion patient chronic pancreatitis secretin stimulation . This pilot study aim test feasibility use MRI ASL measure pancreatic perfusion patient chronic pancreatitis view perfect technique . This allow future study compare pancreatic perfusion healthy adult control patient chronic pancreatitis thus improve investigator understand pathophysiology pain patient chronic pancreatitis .</detailed_description>
