	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) chronic autoimmune disease lymphocytes inflict damage axon myelin sheaths central nervous system . Persons multiple sclerosis ( pwMS ) long advised avoid physical activity benefit exercise improve cardiovascular cognitive function pwMS become important aspect standardize rehabilitation program . Recent finding show achieved adaptation exercise associate intensity dependent lactate increase exercise . This dose-response relationship mode exercise intensity implicate relevance exercise protocol high exercise intensity seem facilitate great benefit , also pwMS . This pilot study evaluate influence acute bout moderate physical exercise ( cycle ) relaxation cognitive function three time point . Primary outcome difference ( timepoint t2 ) cognitive function assess via Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( SDMT ) Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised ( BVMT-R ) T1-3 BICAMS battery . Results randomise controlled Trial investigates specific influence three-week train intervention Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , Insulin Growth Factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) central neurobiological parameter neuroplasticity , cardiorespiratory Fitness cognitive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives To determine response acute moderate exercise bout cognitive function pwMS . Hypothesis - Comparisons different Training mode : exercise ( overland cycling ) versus relaxation - Improvements cognitive functionning ( Memory , process Speed ) Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( SDMT ) Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised ( BVMT-R ) T1-3 - Correlations intensity-dependent lactate increase cognitive function Experimental design Two-pronged , case control study . Randomization 20 MS patient Group `` Exercise '' ( n=10 ) - perform 30 minute cycle Ergometer - `` Relaxation ( n=10 ) perform relaxation comfortable quiet environment . Both group crossover t2 respective Group . The study set normal rehabilitation program participant give physician clearance , inform study give write consent study start . Cognitive assessment perform Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( SDMT ) Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised ( BVMT-R ) T1-3 . SDMT test information process speed . The test consist single digit pair abstract symbol . Rows nine symbol arrange pseudo-randomly . The participant must say number corresponds symbol . The SDMT complete within 5 min , include instruction , practice testing . The good psychometric property SDMT well described . BVMT-R T1-3 require participant inspect 2 Ã— 3 stimulus array abstract geometric figure . There three learn trial 10 s. The array remove patient require draw array memory , correct shape correct position . The psychometric property BVMT-R T1-3 good . Cognitive function assess time point t1 t2 Exercise / Relaxation . At baseline participant perform progressive cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) cycle ergometer ( Ergoline 800 , Germany ) . Cardiopulmonary fitness level monitor direct continuous measurement ( breath breath ) maximum oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) ergospirometer ( PanGas , CPX , Germany ) . The exercise protocol consist ( ) first 3 minute rest ( pedal ) cycle ergometer ; ( b ) 3 minute unload pedal warm ; ( c ) test phase participant reach symptom limited maximum . Workload continuously ramp type increase 5-10 Watts every minute ensure 8-12 minute test ; ( ) final 3 minute unload pedal cool . Heart rate ( Polar Electro , Kempele , Finland ) blood pressure ( Riva Rocci ) monitor last 10 second every 2 minute test . The 10-point BORG scale therapy short form assess rate perceive exertion ( RPE ) phase ( c ) ( ) . Peak oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) define high VO2 value follow criterion attain : respiratory equivalent ratio ( RER ) &gt; 1.10 ; peak heart rate ( HRpeak ) within 10 min-1 age predict maximum rating exertion ( RPE &gt; 8.5 ) . The exercise bout consist 30 minute physiologically define heart rate control cycle 50-60 round per minute ( rpm ) lactate threshold ( equal 75 % HRpeak 60 % VO2max ) . Relaxation consist 30 minute rest comfortable quiet surround . Exercise Relaxation perform timepoints t1 t2 .</detailed_description>
