	<brief_summary>Using pulse oximeter , investigator develop algorithm ass central volume status . Pregnant woman present unique opportunity u investigate algorithm different circumstance . The investigator want specifically investigate algorithm woman undergo regional anesthesia epidural , woman undergo fetal surgery , woman labor give birth ( recovery time follow delivery ) . This help investigator understand central volume status change woman experience unique circumstance . The Investigators also want put pulse oximeter fetal hand possible certain maternal fetal intervention . The Investigators would like examine algorithm data fetus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Compensatory Reserve Obstetrical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Investigators hypothesize Compensatory Reserve Index ( CRI ) algorithm help guide fluid management woman undergo regional anesthesia , give birth , and/or undergoing maternal fetal intervention surgery . Specific aim : Collect noninvasive physiological waveform data patient undergoing regional anesthesia either fetal intervention surgery labor delivery Children 's Hospital Colorado order : 1 . Determine regional anesthesia influence CRI algorithm calculation 2 . Determine CRI algorithm able detect change central volume status associate fetal surgery . 3 . Determine CRI algorithm able detect change central volume status associate labor childbirth specifically time delivery , woman experience amount bleeding . 4 . Examine CRI associate induction regional anesthesia determine minimal CRI one expect hypotension trend CRI follow induction regional anesthesia could anticipate/predict hypotension . 5 . Determine correlation fetal heart rate abnormality CRI . 6 . Examine CRI associate fetal monitoring .</detailed_description>
