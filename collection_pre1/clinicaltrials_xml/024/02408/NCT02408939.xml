	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Patients successfully resuscitate cardiac arrest experience `` sepsis-like '' syndrome characterize cytokine storm , endotoxemia , coagulopathy , various degree adrenal insufficiency . These pathophysiological mechanism contribute development circulatory failure , i.e . post-resuscitation shock . Post-resuscitation shock patient resuscitate vasopressor-requiring cardiac arrest frequently poorly responsive high-rate vasopressor infusion ( e.g . norepinephrine ≥0.5 μg/kg/min ) intravenous fluid . The postresuscitation systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) may partly cause subsequently amplify ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) -associated disruption intestinal mucosal barrier . Steroids may suppress key event I/R injury propagation . Furthermore , shock state , stress-dose steroid improve vascular responsiveness vasopressor preserve monocyte neutrophil phagocytosis , dendritic cell function . Low-dose steroid may reduce mortality severely ill patient septic shock . Nosocomial infection constitute important cause postresuscitation mortality . We hypothesize exposure stress-dose steroid and/or CPR may associate reduce risk death due postresuscitation infectious complication . To test hypothesis , combine data two prior , prospective study in-hospital cardiac arrest . These study compare combination vasopressin , steroid , epinephrine ( VSE ) epinephrine alone , respect survival hospital discharge good functional outcome . Patients post-resuscitation shock VSE group receive stress dose hydrocortisone ( 300 mg/day 7 day maximum , follow gradual taper rate 100 mg / day discontinuation day 10 ) . Patients post-resuscitation shock control group receive saline placebo . Follow-up rate high study report incidence post-resuscitation infectious complication similar VSE control group . METHODS Study Design Retrospective analysis prospectively collect data two randomize , clinical study . Study participant hospitalize intensive coronary care unit ( ICUs CCUs ) three tertiary care center : Evaggelismos General Hospital 401 Greek Army Hospital ( Athens , Greece ) , University Hospital Larissa , Larissa , Greece . Ethics Approval The present analysis associate clinical intervention , therefore , investigator apply waiver inform consent either patient his/her next kin . Moreover , investigator request permission confirm previously record microbiological data hospital ' electronic databases The institutional review board ( IRBs ) aforementioned hospital grant approval current study . Evaggelismos Hospital approval No . 14/9/1/2015 ; 401 Greek Army Hospital approval No . 3/2015/5/2/2015 ; Larissa University Hospital approval No . 58905/2014/14/1/2015 . Modifications statistical terminology [ individual patient data ( IPD ) meta-analysis IPD re-analysis ] infection ' classification definition primary outcome also approve Evaggelismos IRB ( respective Approval Nos . 30/25/2/2016 29/25/2/2016 ) communicate 2 , aforementioned IRBs . These approval ratify IRBs 2 participate center ( 401 Greek Army Hospital , IRB Decision No . : 4-2016/6/4/2016 ; Larissa University Hospital , IRB Decision No . : 5/19-5-2016/Θ.18 ) . Additional , significant amendment analysis protocol aim primarily evaluate effect stress-dose steroid lethal septic shock approve Evaggelismos IRB ( Approval No . 9/26/1/2017 ) appropriately communicate 2 , aforementioned IRBs . Analysis Endpoints present dedicated subsection . Patients The reference study population consist 368 patient ( Evaggelismos Hospital , n=288/368=78.2 % ) in-hospital cardiac arrest , require epinephrine cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) accord 2005 Guidelines Resuscitation . During CPR , VSE group patient ( n=178 ) also receive vasopressin methylprednisolone control ( n=190 ) respective saline placebo . At 4 hour CPR , 211 survive patient ( VSE group , n=115 ) , evaluate postresuscitation shock . One hundred three VSE group patient assign stress-dose hydrocortisone 88 control saline placebo . One hundred two VSE group patient 15 control actually treat stress-dose hydrocortisone ( n=117 ) . One VSE group patient receive stress dose hydrocortisone due pharmacist error ; however , patient receive 40 mg methylprednisolone CPR . Definitions Essential prerequisites applicability below-provided definition infection determine ( prior ) occurence participant include study include presence confirmatory investigator recording ( prior diagnosis infection ) also retrieval confirmatory microbiological data hospital record . Ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) define new ( worsen already present ) chest x-ray infiltrate least 2 follow 3 finding : worsen respiratory secretion ( purulent muco-purulent ) , leucocytosis leucopenia ( &gt; 11000/μL &lt; 4000/μL respectively ) , fever hypothermia ( &gt; 38 degree Celcius &lt; 36 degree Celcius respectively ) . VAP diagnosis require least 48 hour postresuscitation endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation . VAP confirm positive tracheobronchial aspirate sample ≥1000000 Colony Forming Units ( CFUs ) /μL ] / concurrent blood culture positive pathogen . Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis ( VAT ) define fever ( &gt; 38 degree Celcius ) attributable another infectious complication positive tracheobronchial aspirate culture ( ≥1000000 CFUs/μL ) yield new bacteria ( present intubation ) , radiographic sign new pneumonia . Bacteremia ( Fungemia ) define isolation pathogen least one blood culture set ( case coagulase negative Staphylococcus specie , Corynebacterium species , 2 positive blood culture set require ) . Septic shock define bacteremia / fungemia plus circulatory failure least 30 % increase norepinephrine infusion requirement day 3 postarrest . Urinary tract infection define fever hypothermia presence least one pathogen urine sample culture concentration ≥100000 CFUs/μL . Post-resuscitation shock , organ / system failure , acute respiratory distress syndrome , hyperglycemia , survival hospital discharge good functional outcome define 2 include VSE study . Organ failure free day ventilator free day determine 2 included VSE study . Statistical Analysis Plan All analyse perform Statistical Package Social Sciences version 22.0 ( IBM , Armonk , NY , USA ) . As randomized study , patient baseline characteristic compare Steroids No Steroids group . Distribution normality test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Dichotomous categorical variable compare two-sided chi-square Fisher 's exact test . Continuous variable compare two-tailed , independent sample test Mann-Whitney exact U test . We conduct cumulative incidence compete risk analysis ( CICR ) determine cause-specific hazard ratio ( CSHRs ) 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) death due postresuscitation infection , i.e. , lethal septic shock , death due noninfectious cause , poor inhospital outcome ( defined outcome measure subsection ) . Prespecified risk factor physical death poor inhospital outcome group ( Intervention vs. Control ) ; cardiac arrest cause ( cardiac vs. non-cardiac ) ; cardiac arrest area ( monitor vs. non-monitored ) , initial cardiac arrest rhythm ( shockable vs. non-shockable ) ; cardiac arrest time ( i.e . weekday vs. holiday nighttime vs. morning-to-late evening ) , advanced life support ( ALS ) -related bicarbonate dose ; time resuscitation team call ALS initiation plus ALS duration ; therapeutic hypothermia ( yes vs. ) .
