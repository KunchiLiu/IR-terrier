	<brief_title>Pilot Project Examine Effects Exercise Nocturnal Lipolysis Men Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This primary goal pilot project obtain preliminary data demonstrate feasibility measure lipolysis fat oxidation sleep adult human subject use microdialysis , stable isotope label technique , whole-room indirect calorimetry . The result study use grant application perform definitive study use method . The long term goal line research explore mechanism responsible sex base difference effectiveness physical activity approach weight loss . Previous longitudinal data show normal weight obese individual , give increase physical activity , significantly great loss fat mass men relative woman [ Westerterp , 1997 ] . These data need reconcile , however , wealth data demonstrate exercise , woman release oxidize fat readily men [ Horton , 2009 ; Horton 1998 , Moro 2007 ] . This phenomenon seem counterintuitive , give men less body fat woman able lose body fat woman begin weight loss program [ Bjorntorp , 2007 ] . Recent data suggest mechanism explain paradox . Specifically , obese subject , 24-hour fat oxidation increase follow daytime bout exercise , increase occur men drive significant increase fat oxidation day rather sleep night follow exercise [ Bergouignan , 2014 ] . Since predominant source fuel sleep free fatty acid ( FFA ) release adipose tissue ( i.e. , lipolysis ) , may enhance sleep lipolysis key factor exercise stimulate fat oxidation thus great fat loss male vs. female time . The primary objective propose study demonstrate feasibility measure nocturnal whole-body regional lipolysis use stable isotope technique microdialysis subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue respectively long term goal determine effect acute exercise daytime rate lipolysis night men woman . A secondary objective study determine nocturnal regional lipolysis measure microdialysis subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue whole body lipolysis measure stable glycerol isotope infusion relate dietary whole body fat oxidation measure stable isotope label fatty acid whole-room calorimetry , respectively . Finally , study aim determine sleep quality parameter measure EEG wrist actigraphy correlate measure nocturnal fat oxidation lipolysis ( regional whole body )</detailed_description>
