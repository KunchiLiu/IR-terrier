	<detailed_description>Primarily , single arm phase I study prostate motion prostate cancer primarily compare prostate motion different treatment duration IMRT VMAT . The radiation therapy deliver use intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) Volumetric Modulated Arc therapy ( VMAT ) aid volumetric image guidance ensure accuracy real-time 3D ultrasound image observational record prostate motion . All recruit patient prescribe treated either VMAT IMRT treatment . In order simulate behaviour prostate motion IMRT scenario , group VMAT patient require remain treatment position additional 7 minute depend technique use ( week ) . In order ass level acceptance treatment position , responses comfort survey current treatment position ( i.e . use leg immobiliser ) cohort 60 patient treat another IGRT treatment room use baseline . In addition , RTT satisfaction questionnaire also administer assess handle new immobilizer . Acute toxicity measure preset interval use CTCAE version 3.0 International prostate symptom score ( IPSS ) questionnaire focus urinary symptom . Symptoms toxicity report study relevant patient treat IMRT VMAT full bladder protocol .</detailed_description>
