	<brief_summary>Background : - Primary lateral sclerosis ( PLS ) rare disease . It lead weakness muscle arm , leg , face . People PLS develop muscle stiffness call spasticity . Researchers want find good way measure . They want see ultrasound , use sound wave look part body , measure spasticity stiffness muscle . Objective : - To see ultrasound detect measure muscle spasticity people PLS . Eligibility : - People age 18 75 diagnosis PLS enrol protocol 01-N-0145 . - Healthy volunteer age 18 75 . Design : - Participants PLS 1 study visit . Healthy participant upto 5 visit . Each visit 2 hour . - Participants test muscle strength . They examine . They push arm legs researcher different position . - Participants test muscle stiffness . Their arm legs move relax . - Participants muscle ultrasound test . They lie table . Gel place skin muscle arm leg . A probe , like microphone , move skin . Researchers look several muscle . - Participants try stay still ultrasound . It may do several time may do different examiner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Persons corticospinal , upper motor neuron dysfunction increase muscle stiffness spasticity . Spasticity establish clinical examination , reliable objective measure spasticity . New ultrasound technique measure elastic property tissue represent potential measure spasticity . The ultrasound measure tissue elasticity painless quick perform , ability detect change result spasticity uncertain . The goal pilot study see much ultrasound measure muscle elasticity differ patient spasticity healthy control . Secondary objective correlate muscle elasticity measure clinical rating scale spasticity assess intra inter-rater reliability . This protocol primary lateral sclerosis ( PLS ) patient enrol another NIH study diagnose spasticity . Study Population 23 adult PLS patient arm leg spasticity currently enrol NIH protocol 30 healthy adult control normal neurological exam . Design The first phase , investigator training phase , aim become familiar Siemens Acuson S2000 upgrade . The two investigator train 5 healthy volunteer . In second phase inter-observer variability ultrasound Ashworth scale assess healthy volunteer patient evaluate different investigator . Since spasticity fluctuate throughout day , subject consecutively assess inter-observer variability within hour around time follow day ( depend patient availability ) intra-observer variability . Each investigator Ashworth scale independent . Each investigator ultrasound independent . In third phase , assess patient volunteer reach sample size power analysis suggest would need measure difference patient spasticity control . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure muscle stiffness biceps brachii use ultrasound elastography , compare patient group control group . A secondary outcome correlation muscle stiffness rest modify Ashworth score elbow flexion . Measures muscle strength ultrasound measure density thickness examine exploratory fashion . Elastography tibialis anterior examine exploratory fashion .</detailed_description>
