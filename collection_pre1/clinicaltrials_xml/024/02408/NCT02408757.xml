	<brief_summary>As elaborate one study report ultrasonographic change width lateral ventricle clamp EVD/LD indicate ultrasound monitoring might suitable . No firm data exists change width third ventricle , diameter optic nerve brain perfusion clamp EVD/LD , although width structure show depend intracranial pressure . Ultrasonographic measurement change width third ventricle diameter optic nerve would advantage compare ultrasonographic assessment lateral ventricle . First , width third ventricle measure easier reliable width lateral ventricle ( well define insonation plane therefore high repeatability measurement ) 3 . Second , whereas assessment width side third ventricle ultrasound depend temporal bone window ( 10 15 % patient insufficient temporal bone window ) , measurement diameter optic nerve limitation therefore perform almost patient . Hence , measurement diameter optic nerve would allow overcome one major limitation transcranial ultrasound . The latter limitation transcranial ultrasound could also minimize use ultrasound contrast agent ( SonoVue® ) , also yet study . The use ultrasound contrast agent would addition allow study change brain perfusion clamp EVD/LD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Placement CSF drainage catheter ( external ventricular drainage ( EVD ) lumbar drainage ( LD ) ) frequent neurosurgical emergency intervention . It use case obstructive hydrocephalus occur e.g . intracerebral hemorrhage intraventricular involvement , subarachnoid hemorrhage traumatic brain injury also situation reduce CSF resorption increase CSF production ( e.g . meningitis , ventriculitis ) . Furthermore , technique use monitor intracranial pressure . In situation , EVD/LD use reduce elevated intracranial pressure acute phase . However , impairment Paccioni granulation blood breakdown product , continue hydrocephalus may develop , lead permanent necessity CSF drainage . To evaluate need permanent ( implant ) drainage system ( e.g . ventriculoperitoneal ventriculoatrial shunt ) attempt clamp EVD/LD carry subacute phase . Successful clamp verified absent increase intracranial pressure , absent clinical deterioration lack ventricular enlargement serial CT scan . The latter mean first CT scan perform clamping drainage catheter ( baseline examination ) 24 hour clamp drainage catheter . This lead need repeat transportation critically ill patient possible harm patient , high cost , need staff repeat exposure patient radiation . Hence , simple , repeatable , non-invasive , bedside tool diagnosis ventricular enlargement due clamp EVD/LD strongly need . Transcranial ultrasound become widely use technique mainly measure arterial blood flow velocity . More recently , transcranial ultrasound also use assess brain tissue , brain perfusion ventricular size . The major advantage ultrasound non-invasive character , possibility bedside application , low cost safety ( X-ray exposure ) . Some study try use transcranial ultrasound indirect assessment intracranial pressure . As target structure transcranial ultrasound either lateral ventricle , third ventricle diameter optic nerve use . All study could demonstrate correlation width lateral third ventricle diameter optic nerve intracranial pressure . To investigator ' knowledge , one study assess change width lateral ventricle clamp EVD/LD . To summarize , bedside method assessment change ventricle width/diameter optic nerve clamp EVD/LD urgently need would facilitate procedure , high patient safety low cost . By , promise ultrasound method ( transcranial ultrasound without contrast enhancing agent determine width side third ventricle , diameter optic nerve ) , might substitute repeat CT scan evaluate monitor clamp EVD/LD . Objective The investigator hypothesize clamp EVD/LD monitor use repeat bedside ultrasound examination instead repeat CT scan . The purpose study investigate multimodal approach consist ultrasonographic determination change width third side ventricle well diameter optic nerve use screen ventricle enlargement clamp EVD/LD . To end , investigator compare classifier base ultrasound clinical decision base CT. Methods The study consist two additional ultrasonographic examination . The standard treatment patient undergo clamp EVD/LD affect study . The first ultrasonographic examination perform parallel baseline CT scan ( either immediately CT scan ) clamp EVD/LD . The second ultrasound make 24 hour clamp EVD/LD parallel follow-up CT Scan ( either immediately CT scan ) . The examination make bedside supine position ward patient treat .</detailed_description>
