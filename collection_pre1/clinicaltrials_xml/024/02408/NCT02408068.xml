	<detailed_description>This phase I study healthy male volunteer , give dexamethasone suppress natural cortisol production . 18 consent study . They history physical examination , blood test routine safety , hepatitis C HIV , drug abuse ECGs . Following result test inclusion/exclusion criterion study , admit phase I unit first afternoon ( Day -1 ) . They give dexamethasone 22.00hrs evening , remain unit end period . Each volunteer admit 3 period approximately 1.5 day , washout 7 day period , randomise either fast take single 20mg dose immediate release hydrocortisone , fast take single 20mg dose study medication , ( modified release hydrocortisone ) , `` fed '' group , take single dose 20mg study medication , highly calorific standardise breakfast . The volunteer cannulae enable one pre-dose blood sample take follow 24 hour PK sampling ( modified release ) 12 hour PK sampling immediate release period . After sample take volunteer able leave unit . There another assessment 3 5 day study period 3 blood test , assessment adverse event etc .</detailed_description>
