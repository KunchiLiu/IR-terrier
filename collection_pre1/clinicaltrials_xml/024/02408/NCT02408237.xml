	<brief_summary>Neuromodulation characterize technique whose principle neurostimulation produce inhibition cortical arousal . The tDCS ( transcranial direct current stimulation ) noninvasive brain stimulation method use modulate cortical excitability use low intensity direct current ( 1-2mA ) direct scalp via cathode anode electrodes ; current reach cortex , produce hyperpolarization depolarization axonal membrane potential . Evidence show method present technique alter cortical subcortical neural network . This technique use treat psychiatric disorder depression , acute mania , bipolar affective disorder panic , hallucination , obsessive compulsive disorder , schizophrenia , withdrawal , rehabilitation after-stroke pain syndrome neuropathic pain , migraine , pancreatitis chronic pain fibromyalgia . It low-cost technique , virtually side effect carry therapeutic effect neuromodulatory pathway distinct pathway activate drug . In scenario fall within importance develop device home use , inexpensive , easy use maintain benefit observe previous study . The tDCS present non-pharmacological option may offer context society . It noteworthy , benefit demonstrate , impact great importance patient society , since focal technique low cost . Because focal adverse effect conventional drug treatment . Additionally , constitute technical additive pharmacotherapy much pain treatment neuropsychiatric disorder . Therefore , study encourage increase knowledge effect mechanisms involve . If effectiveness method home use confirm , therapeutic impact undoubtedly great importance . However , make project come true , investigator depend support development validation tDCS device home use , allow qualified knowledge apply clinical setting , well advance development area neuroscience Brazil . Therefore , aim study develop tDCS device home use .</brief_summary>
