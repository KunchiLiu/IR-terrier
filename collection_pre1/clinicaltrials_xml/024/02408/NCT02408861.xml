To evaluate effect single agent nivolumab , combination ipilimumab nivolumab herpesvirus specific CD8 CD4 T cell PBMC . VIII . In case Kaposi sarcoma , evaluate effect single agent nivolumab , combination ipilimumab nivolumab viral transcription tumor biopsy . IX . In case anal cancer , evaluate effect single agent nivolumab , combination ipilimumab nivolumab HPV type anal swab , feasible . X . Understand response HIV agent . XI . To evaluate effect single agent nivolumab , combination ipilimumab nivolumab latent HIV load PBMC use outgrowth assay . XII . To evaluate effect single agent nivolumab , combination ipilimumab nivolumab HIV reactive T cell . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study nivolumab . Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Patients dose level 2 also receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 every third course nivolumab , patient dose level -2 also receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 every sixth course nivolumab . Courses repeat every 14 day 46 course nivolumab ( ipilimumab receive dose level 2 -2 ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 16 week 112 day ( base 5 half life ) .</detailed_description>
