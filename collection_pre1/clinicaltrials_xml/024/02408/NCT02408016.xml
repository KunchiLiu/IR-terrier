	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose genetically modify T cell treat patient stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) mesothelioma . Many type cancer cell , include NSCLC mesothelioma , normal cell , protein call Wilms tumor ( WT ) 1 surface . This study take type immune cell patient , call T cell , modifies gene laboratory program find cell WT1 kill . The T cell give back patient . Cyclophosphamide aldesleukin may also stimulate immune system attack cancer cell . Giving cyclophosphamide aldesleukin laboratory-treated T cell may help body build immune response kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety , potential toxicity associate treat patient metastatic NSCLC mesothelioma polyclonal autologous central memory naïve cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ T cell transduce express WT1-specific T-cell receptor ( TCR ) ( Arm 1 Arm 2 ) . II . Determine feasibility treat patient metastatic NSCLC mesothelioma polyclonal autologous central memory naïve CD8+ T cell transduce express WT1-specific TCR ( Arm 1 Arm 2 ) . III . Determine compare vivo persistence blood tumor transfer polyclonal autologous central memory naïve CD8+ T cell transduce express WT1-specific TCR ( Arm 1 Arm 2 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor efficacy patient metastatic NSCLC mesothelioma ( Arm 1 ) , measure time progression ( TTP ) base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion . II . Determine vivo functional capacity adoptively transfer polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell transduce express WT1-specific TCR , assess acquisition phenotypic characteristic associate T cell exhaustion ( Arm 1 Arm 2 ) . III . Determine migration tumor sit adoptively transfer polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell transduce express WT1-specific TCR ( Arm 2 ) . IV . Evaluate tumor response T cell infiltration tumor patient stage IIIA NSCLC treat neo-adjuvant setting . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn lymphocytes follow phase II study . Patients assign 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I , STAGE I : Patients receive autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn lymphocytes intravenously ( IV ) day 0 14 , cyclophosphamide IV day 11 12 , aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) 14 day . Patients receive radiation chest/lung tissue may receive T lymphocytes 90 day completion radiation . ARM I , STAGE II : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV day -3 -2 , autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn lymphocytes IV day 0 , aldesleukin SC BID 14 day . ARM II : Patients receive autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn lymphocytes IV 24-96 hour last dose chemotherapy receive aldesleukin SC BID 14 day . Patients undergo surgery within 3-4 week T-cell infusion . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 12 month annually 14 year .</detailed_description>
