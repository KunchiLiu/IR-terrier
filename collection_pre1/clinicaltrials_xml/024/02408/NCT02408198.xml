	<brief_title>The Street Smart Group : A Feasibility Trial Group Intervention Targeting Anxiety Processes Paranoia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis often experience distress worry belief people intend cause harm ( also know paranoia ) . Paranoid belief associate significant distress disruption person 's life . This result high use service cost mental health provider . The National Institute Clinical Excellence recommend cognitive behavioural therapy psychosis ( CBTp ) offer everybody schizophrenia spectrum psychosis . The late meta analysis report improve outcome , reduce inpatient stay follow CBTp , make cost effective intervention . Although improved outcome obtain therapy , CBTp small moderate effect paranoid belief . Further , train therapist competently deliver CBTp intensive , expensive take year . CBTp therefore widely available service user , result inequality access care . The investigator seek improve outcome accessibility CBTp people distress , paranoid belief . The propose research programme aim conduct feasibility study brief therapeutic group intervention , aim target improve anxiety process causally implicate paranoia . The investigator preliminary evidence indicate pilot intervention deliver individual format , interactive multimedia content , reduce distress belief improve coping ( Freeman et al , 2014 ) . Participants also report found intervention acceptable , enjoyable useful . Based result , investigator develop intervention current study proposes evaluate modify intervention deliver group format . A pilot randomise control trial ( RCT ) novel group intervention conduct inform development estimate key parameter require plan large trial . The feasibility efficacy therapy investigate randomised control design ( n = 35 ) between-groups longitudinal design compare key outcomes people receive intervention estimate key trial parameter . Participants randomise either immediate intervention delay intervention condition ( offer intervention complete assessment ) use 2:1 ratio . Participants randomise complete baseline measure use independent web-based randomisation service . The researcher deliver intervention therefore blind group allocation . Participants recruit community mental health team standalone psychology service South London Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust . As pilot study , statistical analysis mainly descriptive nature , aim provide estimate key trial parameter inform power calculation future large scale trial . A description sample present use mean standard deviation continuous data , median interquartile range data skew . Frequencies proportion use analyse categorical variable . Feasibility trial procedure assess use proportion predetermine parameter estimate 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) . Population variances future power calculation determine use upper 80th percentile confidence interval around estimate population variance , recommend Browne ( 1995 ) .</detailed_description>
