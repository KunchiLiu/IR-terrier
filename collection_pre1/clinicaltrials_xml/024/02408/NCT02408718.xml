	<brief_title>Assistive Device Training Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 people Multiple Sclerosis , routinely use ambulatory assistive device fall least past year , randomize two group . One group receive 6-week training program use assistive device ; group wait-listed , may choose receive training participation study complete . All participant receive mobility assessment baseline , 6-8 week later , 3 month . All participant record fall fall calendar . Participants train group receive MRI scan assess neural connectivity baseline completion train program . The purpose study determine whether participation training program reduces fall increase functional mobility compare wait-listed group , also determine whether change neural connectivity , assess MRI scan , see participate training .</detailed_description>
