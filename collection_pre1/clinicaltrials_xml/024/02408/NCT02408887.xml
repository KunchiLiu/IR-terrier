	<brief_summary>Background : - Papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) often spread lymph node neck . This hard detect . People often lymph node remove anyway , researcher want study good idea . Objective : - To compare effectiveness remove lymph node neck show evidence cancer along thyroid , remove thyroid . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 old PTC thyroid nodule suspicious PTC , evidence disease spread body . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test , scan , x-ray . - Participants : - Answer question . They may tumor biopsy . - Have flexible laryngoscopy . A small tube pas nose vocal cord . - Group 1 : surgery remove thyroid gland . Lymph nod neck remove cancer spread . - Group 2 : surgery remove thyroid lymph node neck . - At post-surgery visit , participant answer question blood drawn . In addition : - 1 day : laryngoscopy . - 2 week : possible laryngoscopy . - 3 month : ultrasound thyroid neck . - Discuss whether try hormone treatment and/or radioactive iodine . - Possible diagnostic whole body radioiodine scan ( WBS ) . Participants swallow capsule liquid lie camera . - 6 month : ultrasound maybe laryngoscopy . - 1 year : diagnostic WBS ultrasound . Participants may get thyroid stimulate hormone . - Participants annual follow-up visit 10 year . They physical exam , blood drawn , scan , may complete questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Thyroidectomy With Without Prophylactic Central Neck Lymph Node Dissection People With Low-risk Papillary Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Thyroid cancer common endocrine malignancy papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) account 80 % thyroid cancer . - The incidence thyroid cancer rise past decade . - Central neck lymph node metastasis ( LNM ) common PTC preoperative imaging study identify involve lymph node central neck . - It remain controversial prophylactic central neck lymph node dissection ( pCND ) patient low-risk PTC result low rate persistent/recurrent disease high complication rate randomize control trial address issue date . - Serum thyroglobulin ( Tg ) , especially TSH-stimulated , sensitive specific marker persistent/recurrent PTC , absence interfere anti-Tg antibody . - Retrospective study compare postoperative TSH-stimulated Tg level underwent pCND conflict result . A randomized trial need . - Health-related quality life ( QOL ) well-accepted tool measure outcome cancer treatment . SF-36 v2 questionnaire frequently use evaluate QOL patient thyroid cancer . There study evaluate difference QOL patient low-risk PTC undergoing total thyroidectomy ( TT ) without pCND . Objectives : -To determine compare biochemical cure rate patient low-risk PTCs undergoing total thyroidectomy ( TT ) without pCND measure postoperative TSH-stimulated serum thyroglobulin ( stim-Tg ) 3 month ( prior RAI treatment ) . Eligibility : - Patients great equal 18 year thyroid nodule ( ) great equal 1 cm . le equal 4 cm . size either : - inconclusive thyroid cytology positive BRAF V600E mutation RET/PTC rearrangement - cytologically suspicious consistent PTC - Absence extrathyroidal extension lymphadenopathy suggest metastatic PTC physical examination neck ultrasound . Design : - Prospective , single-blinded , randomize control clinical trial . - Cytology review Laboratory Pathology , NCI . Once patient provide write informed consent , receive routine history , physical , radiographic ( neck ultrasonography ( USG ) , and/or indicated test ) examination well blood test . Preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology BRAFV600E mutation perform participant either test performed . - Preoperative assessment QOL use standardized questionnaire ( SF-36 v2 ) obtain within 30 day prior surgery - Preoperative vocal cord assessment do flexible laryngoscopy . - Participants randomize clinical staging , include ultrasonography , receive TT pCND TT alone blind result randomization treatment . Patients remain blinded treatment assignment duration study except patient assigned TT alone find lymph node metastasis describe . - If participant TT alone group find lymph node metastasis time operation frozen section analysis , therapeutic CND perform . Participants remain intention treat ( TT alone ) group . TT patient inform therapeutic CND indicate blind broken patient prior study completion . - All participant intact parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , calcium electrolyte check preoperatively , morning surgery , 2 week , 6 month postoperatively . - Postoperative flexible laryngoscopy perform postoperative day 1 ( postoperative day 2 , perform first postoperative day ) 6 month postoperatively vocal cord abnormality find postoperative day 1 - Postoperative assessment QOL do day 1 , 2 week , 3 month 6 month , 1 , 5 10 year postoperatively . - Participants postoperative hypoparathyroidism ( low PTH hypocalcemia ) treat calcium replacement without vitamin D analogue . Serum PTH electrolytes monitor resolve . - Stim-Tg checked 3 month postoperatively ( prior RAI scan/ablation , indicate ) 1 year postoperatively 1 year post-remnant ablation . Unstimulated Tg , thyroid function test , anti-thyroglobulin antibody check annually 10 year . - Soft tissue neck ultrasonography perform patient preoperatively every year postoperatively first 10 year . - If biochemical evidence tumor recurrence occurs , patient undergo appropriate radiographic study and/or nuclear scintigraphy . Tissue biopsy suspicious lesion ( ) perform clinically indicate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm least 1 thyroid nodule great equal to1 cm . le equal 4 cm measure great dimension confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI : indeterminate thyroid biopsy per Bethesda criterion BRAF V600E mutation RET/PTC rearrangement cytologically histologically suspicious confirm PTC per Bethesda criterion Age &gt; 18 year . Because PTC occur rarely patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Absence radiographic evidence extrathyroidal extension . Absence abnormal lymphadenopathy suggest metastatic PTC physical examination and/or image study . ECOG performance status less equal 2 Patients must adequate organ function safely undergo general anesthesia thyroidectomy . Laboratory value obtain less equal 4 week prior surgery must demonstrate adequate bone marrow function ( Hb great equal 6.0 mmol/L , absolute neutrophil count great equal 1.5 x 109/L , platelet great equal 80 x 109/L ) , liver function ( serum bilirubin less equal 2 x ULN , serum transaminase less equal 3 x ULN ) . Patients chronic kidney disease chronic renal replacement therapy allowed.. Other test , pulmonary function test , cardiac echocardiogram stress test , perform clinically indicate . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Pregnant woman eligible however woman pregnant baseline must become pregnant prior surgery first 3 month surgery . Women become pregnant asked practice effective form birth control 3 month surgery , pregnant enter study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients previous thyroid surgery Patients concurrent thyroid cancer hyperparathyroidism . Patients whose tumor deem unresectable clinical/imaging criterion . Patients know synchronous distant metastatic disease . Patients active concurrent malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinomain situ cervix . Patients previous malignancy without evidence disease &gt; 5 year eligible . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
