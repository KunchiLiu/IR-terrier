	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare efficacy safety vaginal buccal misoprostol woman undergo labor induction great equal 37+ 0 complete week gestation . Thus , investigator efficacy safety primary outcome . The secondary objective study assess pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter two route administration sub-cohort trial . The long term objective line research inform provider ' clinical decision make large number woman labor induction . By provide robust PK pharmacodynamic ( PD ) evaluation , clinical outcome data two route administration , clinician inform evidence-based decision prefer route administration misoprostol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction With Misoprostol : Oral Mucosa Versus Vaginal Epithelium ( IMPROVE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Misoprostol currently administer many different way . It administer vaginally , rectally , orally , buccally , sublingually . Each route benefit potential drawback . While vaginal administration common , recent trend practice yield buccal use drug . There extensive clinical experience agent large body publish report support safety efficacy use appropriately . However , find one publish trial directly compare buccal vaginal misoprostol head-to-head . In trial , significant difference outcomes high rate tachysystole buccal group . However , trial utilize high dos misoprostol ( 100mcg ) typically use clinically per ACOG Practice Bulletin ( start 25 mcg ) . Additionally , comparison pharmacokinetics misoprostol buccal vaginal route . In fact , PK study compare route woman undergo pregnancy termination 1st 2nd trimester include woman undergo labor induction term . As physiological change pregnancy profound impact drug metabolism disposition , important gap current knowledge . The 3 Specific Aims trial : 1 . To compare efficacy safety 25 mcg misoprostol initially follow 50mcg thereafter administer either buccal vaginal route placebo-controlled , double blind RCT . We recruit woman term undergo labor induction accomplish trial . 2 . To compare PK parameter 25 mcg 50 mcg misoprostol administer either buccal vaginal route . Further , analyze clinical outcome Aim 1 base PK parameter , control patient characteristic , assess impact PK parameter clinical success drug . In way , hope comment strategic dose individualize dose model potential labor induction misoprostol . 3 . To compare trial participant satisfaction route administration improve patient-based outcome . This do administer satisfaction survey end trial . As participant study drug place buccally vaginally , uniquely able comment comfort preference route delivery . We recruit woman admit term labor induction provider plan utilize misoprostol . Women randomize receive either buccal vaginal misoprostol ; first dose 25 mcg follow 50mcg subsequent dos . Three hundred woman recruit overall trial subcohort 60 woman recruit participate PK portion trial .</detailed_description>
