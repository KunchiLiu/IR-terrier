	<brief_title>Breast Cancer - Anti-Progestin Prevention Study 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer ( BC ) common cancer , affect 1.4 million woman per year third die disease . There urgent need new approach BC prevention . Progesterone hormone produce naturally woman 's ovary menstrual cycle often use hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) menopause . When used HRT progesterone increase risk BC BC death . In experiment mice rat progesterone show increase growth normal mammary gland ( rodent breast ) . When human breast tissue grow laboratory also grow response progesterone . In particular progesterone show increase growth particular cell call stem cell survive long time breast . It think exposure stem cell progesterone many year reason woman whose period start early finish late pregnancy interrupt menstrual cycle take HRT increase risk BC . In project investigator use drug block effect progesterone call ulipristal acetate ( UA , EsmyaTM ) currently licence treatment fibroid uterus . When used treat fibroid UA well tolerate increase side effect compare placebo tablet . 30 woman increase risk BC recruit magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan mammogram follow biopsy one breast . After 3 month UA treatment MRI repeat along biopsy breast . The effect UA many different cell type biopsy , include stem cell also tissue like collagen support examine detail . The effect UA treatment gene protein expression breast tissue also examine . The goal identify woman sensitive resistant UA BC prevention treatment . In addition change MRI scan UA treatment examine use several different analysis technique try identify likely benefit UA treatment future without need biopsy .</detailed_description>
