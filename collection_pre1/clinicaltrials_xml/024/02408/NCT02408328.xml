	<brief_summary>Apnea common discharge-delaying diagnosis Newborn Intensive Care Unit . While relatively common extremely premature infant , also occur frequently late preterm even full term infant . Since majority birth include late preterm infant full term infant , absolute number late preterm full term infant apnea remain significant . Evidence-based guideline management apnea infant exist . Current management fall two distinct different category . This study compare two distinct management strategy . Our study prospective , randomized pilot trial provide data regard ( ) feasibility recruitment study protocol ( b ) provide preliminary data regard efficacy treatment arm . Our primary objective test hypothesis early discharge outpatient monitoring late preterm term infant apnea prematurity result decrease length hospital stay , safe , result improve patient satisfaction , assess PedsQL questionnaire Impact Family Scale . Our study population include infant meet follow criterion : ( 1 ) Born great equal 34 0/7 week gestation ; ( 2 ) Are assign diagnosis apnea , bradycardia , and/or oxygen desaturations primary clinical team ; ( 3 ) Have meet discharge criterion ( i.e . feed maturity , temperature regulation , etc . ) apnea/bradycardia/desaturation remain final discharge issue least 7 day . Infants enrol research study randomize hospital observation versus early discharge home caffeine home monitor . Neither strategy experimental currently utilized neonatologists locally nationally . A direct comparison two treatment , however , never undertake study . If infant assign hospital group , remain hospital apnea free period least 5 consecutive day establish . Outpatient follow occur per unit standard typically include nursing visit doctor visit within 2-3 day discharge . Caregivers ask complete 3 brief questionnaire enrollment , 1 month hospital discharge , 6 month age . Each questionnaire ask topic satisfaction hospital stay , quality life , number acute care visit and/or rehospitalizations . Alternatively , infant assign early discharge group , caffeine give infant 3 day period apnea note infant discharge home continue daily caffeine therapy mouth well home monitor . Caffeine commonly use drug neonate excellent safety profile . Side effect minimal may infrequently consist gastroesophageal reflux . All caregiver receive training use home monitor . Initial outpatient follow occur per unit standard typically include nursing visit doctor visit within 2-3 day discharge . Additionally , caregiver contact via telephone within 2 day answer question address concern pertain apneic event , home monitor use , caffeine therapy . Follow pulmonary clinic arrange 42-43 week gestational age time caregiver teach determine baseline frequency monitor alarm caffeine . At 43 week correct gestational age , caregiver instruct discontinue caffeine therapy advise contact pulmonary clinic alarm frequency increase . An outpatient record oximetry study arrange least 1 week discontinuation caffeine therapy . Home pulse oximetry monitoring discontinue significant event record . Caregivers ask complete 3 brief questionnaire enrollment , 1 month discontinuation home monitor , 6 month age . Each questionnaire ask topic satisfaction hospital stay , quality life , number monitor alarm , acute care visit and/or rehospitalizations .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Study Design This prospective , randomize study . Our primary objective test hypothesis early discharge outpatient monitoring late preterm term infant apnea prematurity result decrease length hospital stay , safe cost effective , result improve patient satisfaction , assess PedsQL questionnaire Impact Family Scale . 2 . Patient Selection Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 3 . Description Study Treatments Exposures/Predictors The investigator identify qualified infant meet eligibility criterion enrollment , obtain informed consent time . Infants randomize apnea , bradycardia , and/or oxygen desaturation sole remain discharge criterion least 7 day . Prior randomization , receipt write informed consent , investigator confirm primary clinical team determine alternate etiology apnea/bradycardia/desaturation event , base diagnostic test clinical judgment . Randomization stratify accord gestational age birth include two broad category follow : 1 ) late preterm infant bear 34 0/7 36 6/7 week gestation ( late preterm infant ) 2 ) term infant bear great 37 0/7 week gestation . Our aim recruit least 5 infant treatment arm late preterm full term infant . Arm A include continued inpatient monitoring apnea , bradycardia , and/or desaturation event free period time ( 5 day per current standard care participate institution ) establish deem appropriate discharge home per discretion responsible provider . The protocol describe Arm A currently utilized standard care many infant locally nationally first management option utilize participate institution . Arm B include initiation caffeine treatment randomization establish . Per current dosing guideline , patient receive one-time loading dose 20 milligram per kilogram day 1 daily maintenance dose thereafter 10 milligram per kilogram . Monitoring caffeine drug level include protocol safety caffeine treatment neonate without laboratory monitoring well establish . After receive load dose caffeine , infant receive continued inpatient monitoring apnea/bradycardia/desaturation event free period time ( 3 day per current standard care participate institution ) establish deem appropriate discharge home per discretion responsible provider . Infants discharge home caffeine therapy receive instruction regard use home monitor , alarm set alarm heart rate &lt; 80 &gt; 200 beat per minute , oxygen saturation level &lt; 90 % . The protocol describe Arm B currently utilized standard care many infant locally nationally secondary option observation alone result prolonged inpatient stay due persistent apnea discharge criterion meet . In recent retrospective analysis home monitor use , investigator find 1 20 infant apnea prematurity discharge home monitor . Following discharge home , infant Arm B contact via telephone within 2 day answer question address concern pertain apneic event , home pulse oximeter use , caffeine therapy . Follow pulmonary clinic arrange 42-43 week gestational age time caregiver teach determine baseline frequency monitor alarm caffeine . At 43 week correct gestational age , caregiver instruct discontinue caffeine therapy advise contact pulmonary clinic alarm frequency increase . An outpatient record oximetry study arrange least 1 week discontinuation caffeine therapy . Home pulse oximetry monitoring discontinue significant event , previously define , record . Follow discharge treatment arm otherwise proceed per unit protocol typically consist home visit nurse within 2-3 day hospital discharge primary care provider appointment within 2-3 day hospital discharge . 4 . Data Collection Methods , Assessments , Interventions Schedule ( assessment perform , often ) For infant arm , parent participate structure questionnaire enrollment , 1 month hospital discharge patient Arm A 1 month discontinuation home monitor use patient Arm B . The investigator also contact family 6 month age determine rehospitalization rate , frequency emergency department visit related respiratory issue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Our study population include infant meet follow criterion : ( 1 ) Born great equal 34 0/7 week gestation ; ( 2 ) Are assign diagnosis apnea , bradycardia , and/or oxygen desaturations primary clinical team ; ( 3 ) Have meet discharge criterion ( i.e . feed maturity , temperature regulation , etc . ) apnea/bradycardia/desaturation remain final discharge issue . As intent study infant hospital stay prolong result presume apnea prematurity , exclusion criterion include : ( 1 ) comorbidities associate increase risk apnea , include neurologic abnormality congenital CNS malformation , seizure , intracranial bleeds , anatomic abnormality airway , significant congenital heart disease , residual lung disease require respiratory support , infectious disease include sepsis , pneumonia , meningitis , chromosomal abnormality , drug withdrawal ; ( 2 ) prolong hospitalization indication apnea , bradycardia and/or oxygen desaturation feed immaturity , temperature instability , phototherapy ; ( 3 ) transfer outside hospital ; ( 4 ) provider concern caregiver ability safely operate comply home monitor use .</criteria>
