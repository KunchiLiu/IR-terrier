	<brief_summary>Femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI ) one common mechanism lead development early cartilage labral damage non-dysplastic hip . Anatomic abnormalities proximal femur and/or acetabulum result repetitive injury dynamic hip motion , lead abnormal regional load femoral head-neck junction acetabular rim . The resulting damage cartilage , labrum , surround capsular structure predispose patient develop hip pain early osteoarthritic change . Clinically , patient FAI heterogeneous group , wide array presentation pain instability may may relate activity . To date study identify specific prognostic indicator associate successful surgical treatment FAI , leave surgeon without adequate criterion determine patient best suit arthroscopy . The investigator propose address critical knowledge gap identify patient characteristic morphological feature hip associate optimal clinical outcome patient undergo hip arthroscopy non-operative management treatment suspect FAI order establish treatment algorithm FAI patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patient 35 year age young enrol HSS Hip Preservation Registry prior September 30 , 2016 MRI confirm diagnosis FAI eligible inclusion study regardless surgery status . Patients agree participate must complete baseline questionnaire consisting : 1 ) Modified Harris Hip Score ( MHHS ) , overall measure hip condition ; 2 ) Hip Outcome Score ( HOS ) , measure develop specifically young active patient measure quality life level sport recreation ; 3 ) International Hip Outcome Tool ( iHOT33 ) , newly develop hip specific outcome score , measure number subscores relate physical social function hip problem . Patients age 35 exclude focus study early change may predispose later degenerative change . Patients undergoing revision hip arthroscopy first treatment Registry eligible , patient fail initial therapy . Patients complete questionnaire time point exclude .</criteria>
