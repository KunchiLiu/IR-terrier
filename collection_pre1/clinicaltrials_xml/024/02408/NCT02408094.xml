	<brief_title>Screening Protein Markers Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis Hot-dampness Blood Stasis Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RA one main disabling disease nowadays , autoimmune disease complex network mechanism involve multiple signal pathway exist cross path . The investigator consider `` heat-dampness blood stasis '' syndrome main syndrome major pathogenesis active RA , base theory traditional Chinese medicine large quantity clinical practice , also examine mechanism experiment . But material basis syndrome remain unclear , lack high specific objective basis ensure syndrome differentiation consistency accurately clinical practice . Proteomic technique study cell body protein expression function , thus potential efficient decode syndrome biological basis . Proteomic technique effective way reveal essence TCM syndrome . The investigator use proteomic technology explore protein marker applicate protein marker syndrome diagnosis hot-dampness blood stasis syndrome patient RA . With strong clinical applicability , reveal scientific connotation syndrome , preliminarily guide syndrome differentiation .</detailed_description>
