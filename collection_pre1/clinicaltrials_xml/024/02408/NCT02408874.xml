	<brief_summary>Background : - Nanosilver tiny silver particle . Many product contain nanosilver , like antimicrobial cleaning supply antimicrobial fabric . Some product also contain nanosilver solution people inhale . The company make product claim help boost immune system . Objective : - To learn inhale nanosilver affect lung immune system . In addition , see nanosilver affect lung function get absorb bloodstream inhale . Eligibility : - Healthy , non-smoking adult age 18 60 . Design : - Participants pre-screened phone . - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They give blood urine sample . - Participants lung function test . They breathe spirometer . It mouthpiece attach tube connect computer . - Participants methacholine challenge test . They blow spirometer . Then inhale methacholine . - Eligible participant 3 study visit 2 5 week . At visit , repeat screening test . - At visit 1 , participant bronchoscopy . For , intravenous line place arm vein . Electrodes place chest . A tube place nose airway . The airway wash . A sample cell take . - At visit 2 , participant get study treatment . They inhale nanosilver solution mist . They lung function test treatment . - Participants collect urine time get treatment return clinic next day . - At visit 3 , participant turn urine . They another bronchoscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center , single-arm pilot study assess impact inhale silver nanoparticles ( nanosilver nAg ) immune response lung . Non-smoking , healthy adult ( lung cardiovascular condition ) , age 18-60 recruited participate ; pregnant breastfeed woman exclude . Potential participant prescreened telephone schedule final eligibility visit include vital signs/anthropometry , medical/medication history review , physical exam , urine test , blood draw , urine collection , pulmonary function test ( PFTs ; i.e. , spirometry methacholine challenge test ) . After eligibility confirm , participant schedule baseline visit , include vital signs/anthropometry , medical/medication history review , physical exam , blood draw , urine collection , bronchoscopy ( lavage brushing ) . Participants return 14-40 day baseline visit study treatment visit , include vital signs/anthropometry , blood draw , urine collection , spirometry , one-time administration ionic silver via nebulizer , instruction collect urine 24 hour . The next day study treatment visit , participant return visit include vital signs/anthropometry , blood draw , provide 24-hour urine sample , spirometry , bronchoscopy . During bronchoscopy procedure , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid tissue bronchial brushing collect participant obtain alveolar macrophage bronchial epithelial cell . The primary objective study determine whether exposure nanosilver alters immune response lung cell . The primary laboratory analysis determine whether exposure nanosilver mediate change baseline response bronchoscopy-derived , cultured macrophage epithelial cell challenge toll-like receptor ( TLR ) agonist . Additional analysis assess change cytokine level BAL fluid , change lung microbiome , silver penetration blood stream , silver excretion urine , change PFT measure .</detailed_description>
