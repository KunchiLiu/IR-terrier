	<brief_summary>Background study aim : The investigator carry clinical trial two different sealant material compare retentivity decay inhibit property say material . split mouth study , wherein 2 sealant material place exactly opposite place molar 180 healthy school child age group 7 - 10 yrs age . participate ? school child age group 7 - 10 yrs age non decayed contra lateral permanent 1st molar school southern part India . study involve ? period 18 month , retentivity decay prevent effect two sealant material ( RESIN BASED SEALANTS AND ART SEALANTS ) clinically assess u . possible benefits/ risk participate trial participant expose kind risk non invasive procedure possible benefit may prevent decay permanent molar long run study start date/duration study ? MARCH 2015 month wherein sealant application start expect last till Sept 2016 funding ? self fund study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Assess Retention Caries Preventive Effect Resin Based Sealants Versus ART Sealants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pits fissure first molars susceptible site dental caries permanent dentition contemporary study show specifically 85 % caries nest above-mentioned site . Thus , prevention caries tooth sit crucial importance keep sound permanent dentition . Sealing pit fissure molar premolar prevention dental caries first introduce 1960s . It accept highly effective method prevent dental caries . Prominantly , basically two type sealant materials..i.e resin base sealant flowable composite resin Glass inomer base sealant . Reading literature , well understood resin base sealant retentive GIC base sealant mainly enamel surface etch prior placement dispense syrinx , thereby generally adapt well surface . GIC sealant know equally effective come caries prevention , generally far less retentive resin base sealant . main issue regard placement resin base sealant cumbersome procedure require strict isolation . Looking dental public health point view , especially country like India , use resin base sealant outreach centre problem lack adequate infrastructure . To counter limited applicability resin base sealant field setting , use high viscosity GIC sealant advocate . The high viscosity GIC sealant well compressive strength take occulsal stress thereby expect retention ART sealant ( High viscous GIC sealant ) use ART technique ( finger press technique ) would well conventional GIC base sealant . Till date , limited number study perform comparison ART sealant resin base sealant ( gold standard ) thereby , study conceive assess retentivity caries preventive effect two system . The null hypothesis state expect difference resin base sealant ART sealant Based statistical analysis , sample size study estimate 180 subject . ethical clearance obtain IRB dental school inform consent obtain participate subject . This spilt mouth study , wherein side , resin base sealant place side , ART sealant place . All participate 180 subject caries free permanent low 1st right left molar . The sealant place accord manufacturer instruction . placement , retention caries preventive effect follow progressively period 18 month .</detailed_description>
