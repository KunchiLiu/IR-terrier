	<brief_summary>The purpose project study efficacy triheptanoin oil patient Alternating Hemiplegia Childhood ( AHC ) due ATP1A3 gene mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study , Comparative , Single-center , Randomized , Crossover , Double-blind , Against Placebo , Testing Effectiveness Triheptanoin Oil Alternating Hemiplegia Childhood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical spectrum Alternating Hemiplegia Childhood ( AHC ) wide characterize association permanent paroxysmal ( palsy , dystonia , ocular , epileptic , dysautonomic event ) neurological event , onset childhood . Most AHC patient carry mutation ATP1A3 gene . This gene encode Na+/K+ ATPase witch transmembrane ion pump generate chemical electrical gradient sodium potassium across plasma membrane . Those paroxystic event AHC patient mutation ATP1A3 gene could associate glucidic/energetic metabolism intracerebral excitability disorder . Triheptanoin triglyceride , whose derivative pass blood - brain barrier enhance Krebs cycle function . Triheptanoin could therefore allow energy supply brain , essential functioning Na+/ K+ ATPase consume significant amount energy brain . The investigator goal pilot study test effectiveness paroxystic manifestation safety triheptanoin small group patient Alternating Hemiplegia Childhood secondary ATP1A3 mutation .</detailed_description>
