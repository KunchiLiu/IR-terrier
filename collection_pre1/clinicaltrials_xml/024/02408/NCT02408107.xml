	<brief_title>A Home-based Physical Activity Intervention Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due prevalence treatment-related health concern increase risk develop metabolic syndrome , recurrence cardiovascular disease , breast cancer survivor may require diagnostic , therapeutic , supportive palliative service many year post-diagnosis . Encouraging breast cancer survivor adopt healthy lifestyle post-treatment may reduce healthcare burden result treatment-related sequela improve survival . In particular , high level physical activity ( PA ) may positively influence side-effects treatment , enhance quality life reduce risk recurrence all-cause breast cancer-related mortality . However , PA level generally low among breast cancer survivor many woman decrease PA follow diagnosis . Therefore , intervention require improve post-diagnosis PA level breast cancer survivor . Randomised controlled trial ( RCTs ) find improvement cardiorespiratory fitness , HRQoL , fatigue weight maintenance breast cancer survivor participate PA intervention compare control group . However , RCTs utilise facility-based intervention , may limit patient trouble access exercise facility due transportation time-related difficulty . To overcome problem home-based PA intervention investigate generally report good adherence positive effect health , fitness HRQoL outcomes . However , lack relevant intervention United Kingdom .</detailed_description>
