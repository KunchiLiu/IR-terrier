	<detailed_description>Shock condition reduce tissue perfusion , result inadequate delivery oxygen nutrient necessary cellular function . Common cause shock hypovolemia ( excessive blood fluid loss ) , sepsis , cardiac failure , dengue neuroendocrine dysfunction . The current resuscitative measure include administration crystalloid solution ( e.g. , 0.9 % saline , Ringer 's lactate , hypertonic saline ) colloid solution ( e.g. , hydroxyethyl starch , albumin , dextrans ) . These agent extend patient 's life limit extent . Centhaquin ( PMZ-2010 ) low dos reduce blood lactate level , improve blood pressure , cardiac output , survival prove highly effective resuscitative agent . The investigator conduct phase I clinical study human evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics centhaquin citrate normal healthy volunteer . Successful completion phase I study lead efficacy study patient hypovolemic shock .</detailed_description>
