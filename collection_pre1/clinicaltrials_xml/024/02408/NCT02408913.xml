	<brief_summary>Background : - Ebola virus rare disease start fever muscle ache , lead death . The 2014 Ebola outbreak West Africa large date . There approved treatment Ebola . Researchers want see two new vaccine VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP ( MVA-EbolaZ g ) VRC-EBOADC069-00VP ( cAd3-EBO ) safe able induce immune response Ebola . Objectives : - To see two new vaccine safe cause side effect . Also , study immune response vaccine . Eligibility : - Healthy adult age 18-50 . Design : - Participants get one two study vaccine injection depend study group assign . Each injection repeat schedule : - A needle syringe inject vaccine upper arm muscle . - 1-2 day later , participant must call clinic report feel . - For 7 day check temperature thermometer give . They look injection site , measure redness swell ruler . They write symptom . - In first 2 month , participant least 6 clinic visit 1 phone contact . At visit , participant check health change problem . They tell feel take medication . Blood urine sample may collect . - Participants might need extra clinic visit laboratory test health change need check .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VRC 208 : Dose , Safety Immunogenicity Recombinant Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara Ebola Vaccine , VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP ( MVA-EbolaZ ) , Administered Alone Boost cAd3-Ebola Vaccines Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/1b study examine dose , safety , tolerability immunogenicity investigational MVA-vectored Ebola vaccine healthy adult . The vaccine encode wild type ( WT ) glycoprotein ( GP ) Zaire strain Ebola administer intramuscularly ( IM ) needle syringe . The safety tolerability MVA-EbolaZ evaluate escalate dos 1x10 ( 7 ) 1x10 ( 8 ) plaque form unit ( PFU ) . Part 1 include enrollment vaccine-naive subject conduct dose escalation MVA-EbolaZ vaccine evaluate vaccine boost cAd3-EBO vaccine . In Part 2 study , 140 subject receive cAd3-EBO cAd3-EBOZ vaccine VRC 207 study boost MVA-EbolaZ . The hypothesis study vaccine safe elicit immune response Ebola GP , prime-boost regimen safe result polyfunctional response Ebola GP great magnitude duration response either vaccine alone .</detailed_description>
