	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologic diagnosis epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma per pretreatment biopsy laparoscopy , interventional radiology CT guide core biopsy . Histologic documentation original primary tumor require via pathology report . 2 . Patients follow histologic epithelial cell type eligible : High grade serous adenocarcinoma , endometrioid adenocarcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , clear cell adenocarcinoma , mixed epithelial carcinoma , adenocarcinoma otherwise specify ( N.O.S. ) . 3 . Patients must adequate : . Bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1,500/mcl . This ANC induce support granulocyte colony stimulate factor . Platelets great equal 100,000/mcl . ii . Renal function : Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) . iii . Hepatic function : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN . SGOT ( AST ) SGPT ( ALT ) ≤ 3.0 x ULN alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN . iv . Neurologic function : Neuropathy ( sensory motor ) less equal Grade 1 . 4 . Patients free active infection require parenteral antibiotic serious uncontrolled medical illness disorder within four week study entry . 5 . Any hormonal therapy direct malignant tumor must discontinue least one week prior first treatment . Continuation hormone replacement therapy permit . 6 . Patients must performance status score 0 , 1 2 Eastern Cooperative Group ( ECOG ) criterion . 7 . Patients childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior initiation protocol therapy practice effective form contraception . If applicable , patient must discontinue breastfeed prior study entry . 8 . Patients must satisfactory result baseline laboratory analysis diagnostic procedure specify protocol . 9 . Patients must sign IRBapproved informed consent authorization permit release personal health information . 10 . Patients must least 18 year old . 1 . Patients receive prior treatment GEN1 . 2 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition GEN1 agent use study . 3 . Patients receive oral parenteral corticosteroid within 2 week study entry clinical requirement ongoing systemic immunosuppressive therapy relate chemotherapy administration . 4 . Patients receive treatment active autoimmune disease . `` Active '' refers condition currently require therapy . Examples autoimmune disease include systemic lupus erythematosus , multiple sclerosis , inflammatory bowel disease rheumatoid arthritis . 5 . Patients invasive malignancy , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer specific malignancy note protocol exclude evidence malignancy present within last three year . Patients also exclude previous cancer treatment contraindicate protocol therapy . 6 . Patients receive prior radiotherapy portion abdominal cavity pelvis exclude . Prior radiation localize cancer breast , head neck , skin permit , provide complete three year prior registration , patient remain free recurrent metastatic disease . 7 . Patients receive prior chemotherapy abdominal pelvic tumor exclude . Patients may receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy localize breast cancer , provide complete three year prior registration , patient remain free recurrent metastatic disease . 8 . Patients know active hepatitis . 9 . Patients concurrent severe medical problem unrelated malignancy would significantly limit full compliance study expose patient extreme risk decrease life expectancy . 10 . Patients childbearing potential , practice adequate contraception , patient pregnant , patient breastfeed eligible trial . 11 . Patients history evidence upon physical examination CNS disease , include primary brain tumor , seizures control standard medical therapy , brain metastasis , history cerebrovascular accident ( CVA , stroke ) , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) subarachnoid hemorrhage within six month first date treatment study . 12 . Patients condition/anomaly would interfere appropriate placement IP catheter study drug administration include : abdominal surgery within 4 week study entry ( reason IP port placement ) , intestinal dysfunction , suspect extensive adhesion prior history find laparoscopy .</criteria>
