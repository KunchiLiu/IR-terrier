	<brief_title>Effectiveness Computerized Cognitive Training Elderly With Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computerized cognitive training advantage easy accessibility community-dwelling elderly . It much cheap traditional neuropsychological training method , require trained neuropsychologists . Furthermore , may fun easy optimize individual patient ' cognitive status traditional method . Clinical efficacy kind cognitive training application validate several study . A recent systematic review report domain work memory , executive function , process speed benefit classic computerized cognitive training task , benefit comparable traditional cognitive training method . Apart neuropsychological data , neuroimaging study focus effectiveness computerize cognitive training scant . There previous study investigate possible neural substrate computerize cognitive training use multimodal neuroimaging modality simultaneously . Thus , aim investigate effectiveness computerize cognitive training correspond neural substrate subject mild cognitive impairment , subjective memory impairment , normal control multimodal approach .</detailed_description>
