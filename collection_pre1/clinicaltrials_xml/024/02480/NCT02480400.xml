	<detailed_description>This study design determined trial design , form frequency patient contact ( assessment visit number ) effect efficacy outcome 8-week treatment escitalopram . The placebo response major issue clinical trial psychiatric disorders-and especially management depression . Possible contribute factor problem include diagnostic misclassification , issue concern inclusion/exclusion criterion , outcome measure ' lack sensitivity change , measurement error , poor quality data entry verification , wax wan natural course depression , regression toward mean phenomenon , patient clinician expectation trial , study design issue , non-specific therapeutic effect , high attrition . Over past decade , researcher attempt reduce placebo effect variety way . Unfortunately , approach little benefit include restrict enrollment select population , rater training , requirement rater , placebo lead-in phase . Some benefit , although often marginal , derive standardize diagnostic procedure , manage clinician ' overestimation change , simplification study visit assessment , minimize nonspecific , therapeutic effect , extend trial duration , reduce number site , increase sensitivity outcome measure , reduce number treatment arm . Thus far , attempt develop new study design aim reduce placebo effect . We propose novel study design , suitable doubleblind , trial mood disorder .
