	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) characterize irreversible decrease kidney function . It characterize accumulation solute call uremic toxin . Uremic toxins level implicate cardiovascular complication associate CKD . Several protein-bound toxin implicate increase cardiovascular risk indoxyl sulfate ( IS ) , p cresol sulfate ( pCS ) recently indole acetic acid ( IAA ) . All clinical study perform single measurement baseline assume toxin level stable time . The variability uremic toxin level know . Furthermore , little known concern determinant serum toxin level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colonic absorption play major role IS ( indoxyl sulfate ) pCS level . IS pCS level significantly reduce patient colectomy . To validate measurement uremic toxin level serum biomarkers cardiovascular risk , need know intra-individual variability time impact diet digestive disorder uremic toxin serum level . We propose prospective study evaluate intra-individual variability 3 uremic toxin serum level SI , pCS IAA . The main objective study kinetics three serum uremic toxin : indoxyl sulfate , p cresyl sulfate indole acetic acid ( thus determine intra-individual variability ) population chronic hemodialysis patient 1 year .</detailed_description>
