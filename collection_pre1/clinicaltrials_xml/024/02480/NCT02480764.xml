	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) . Azilsartan medoxomil test treat Chinese people essential hypertension . This study look change blood pressure 8 week treatment people take azilsartan medoxomil compare people take valsartan . The study enroll approximately 600 patient . Prior start study treatment , participant receive antihypertensive treatment within 28 day participate 2-week -run period , participant take antihypertensive treatment within 28 day participate 4-week run-in period . Upon completion run-in period , participant randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one three treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg - azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg - Valsartan 160 mg All participant ask take study medication time day throughout study . This multi-centre trial conduct China . The overall time participate study 14 week .
