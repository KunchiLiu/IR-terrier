	<brief_summary>To determine safety , feasibility efficacy Multiple Model Probabilistic Predictive Control / Diabetes Assistant ( MMPPC/DiAS ) system full day night closed-loop control adolescents adult type 1 diabetes . This address two part . There initial 36 hour inpatient study hourly plasma glucose monitoring schedule exercise meal . If system show safe , feasible effective , study proceed supervise hotel study remote monitor test system use 3 days/2 night .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MMPPC : A Probabilistic Closed-loop Artificial Pancreas Handle Unannounced Meals Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To develop refine artificial pancreas system use MMPPC framework investigator develop . The MMPPC controller test number silico study well small cohort clinical study . The controller unique compare closed-loop system require meal announcement prim dose insulin prior meal therefore fully closed-loop system . Initial result encourage investigator achieve acceptable glucose control day night . With protocol , investigator test algorithm , well well algorithm operates within automate , portable closed-loop device , DIAS clinical study . The DIAS system able use glucose sensor input communicate insulin pump . The algorithm incorporate within Android phone , determine insulin delivery . The study involve initial inpatient phase , frequent plasma glucose monitor proceed supervise , remotely-monitored study hotel setting .</detailed_description>
