	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) common complication surgery . Deep-vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) constitute VTE . PE often consequence DVT feared complication common preventable cause hospital death . VTE asymptomatic detect compression ultrasound scan ( CUS ) legs Computer Tomography ( CT ) lung . It wellknown cancer patient higher risk develop VTE , risk approximately seven time higher background population . A Danish study show significantly high risk death VTE diagnose time cancer diagnosis 12 % one year survival compare 36 % cancer patient without history VTE . Approximately 600 woman Denmark diagnose ovarian cancer every year forth common cause cancer death among Danish woman . Earlier study find 31 % ovarian cancer woman develop VTE consequence disease and/or treatment . Very study examine incidence VTE treatment . Methods : A Pulmonary CT-angiography include routinely perform Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography - Computer Tomography ( FDG PET-CT ) reveal pulmonary embolism time first referral . Compressive ultrasound scan include Doppler flow low extremity perform four time first referral one-year follow period detect clinical subclinical deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) initiation treatment . Blood tissue sample take , prepared store -80 degree Danish Cancer-Biobank later analyze coagulation marker . Immune histochemical technique use demonstrate tissue factor ( TF ) tumor tissue . The objective study : 1 . In prospective study Aalborg University Hospital estimate incidence clinical subclinical venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) patient suspected ovarian cancer initiation treatment . The impact VTE survival evaluate . 2 . In prospective cohort correlation marker coagulation fibrinolysis subclinical VTE , tumour burden overall survival evaluate . 3 . Evaluate correlation immunohistochemical demonstrate tissue factor ( TF ) tumour tissue circulate TF peripheral blood relation VTE tumour burden .</detailed_description>
