	<brief_summary>Breast cancer frequently diagnose cancer woman majority receive endocrine therapy ( ET ) adjuvant set . ETs dramatically reduce recurrence improve survival give age population increase survivorship , grow concern regard cognitive effect ETs since estrogen neuroprotective . A critical unanswered question whether difference cognitive decline two class ETs , selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs - tamoxifen ) aromatase inhibitor ( letrozole anastrozole ) , old woman great risk hormone receptor breast cancer cognitive decline . Before large multicentre observational study undertaken investigator propose feasibility study establish metric participation , retention adherence rate parameter estimate inform sample size calculation require detect cognitive difference two ET class . A convenience sample chemotherapy-naïve patient , age 65 old , early stage disease , 25 SERM 50 aromatase inhibitor , assess cognitively baseline one year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The convenience sample consist chemotherapy-naïve woman 65 old first diagnosis early stage HR+ BC , post surgical resection , prescribe either TAM ( n=25 ) AI , anastrozole letrozole ( n=50 ) . Based survey medical oncologist prescribing practice Sunnybrook , investigator able obtain sufficient number convenience sample pool 220 old woman BC refer annually medical radiation oncology Louise Temerty Breast Cancer Clinic Odette Cancer Centre . The investigator recruit consecutively see eligible patient radiotherapy . Experienced clinical trial staff identify eligible patient clinic list medical radiation oncologist , introduce study visit . The Research Coordinator ( RC ) meet interested patient consent conduct screen assessment sign cognitive impairment use Memory Impairment Screen ( MIS ) , sensitive reliable tool . The MIS take 5 minute conducted private room either Louise Temerty Breast Cancer Centre Odette Cancer Centre depend location patient 's appointment . The RC obtain consent pas MIS participate study arrange test . The RC administer assessment battery time convenient patient , radiotherapy . Drug adherence rate obtain use monthly telephone self-reports . After 1 year , participant undergo test protocol baseline use alternate form possible . The RC document many continue meet study criterion include change health status , medication , etc . The investigator expect major selection bias group . While exclusion woman co-administered chemotherapy due confound effect cognition may bias sample include woman co-morbidities , potential bias reduce exclusion previous cancer , life expectancy &lt; 2 year , central nervous system ( CNS ) disorder . To determine bias attrition woman year 1 due cognitive impairment , investigator contact participant caregiver return determine reason .</detailed_description>
