	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well gabapentin plus standard care work compare standard care without Gabapentin prevent inflammation mucous membrane ( mucositis ) patient stage III-IV head neck cancer undergo primary subsequent ( adjuvant ) chemoradiation therapy . Radiation therapy head neck may cause burn involve inside mouth , throat , nasal passage , result pain . Gabapentin may help prevent ( minimize ) pain associate radiation-induced mucositis patient head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gabapentin Compared Standard Care Preventing Mucositis Patients With Stage III-IV Head Neck Cancer Undergoing Primary Adjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether gabapentin use preventive measure chemoradiation reduce radiation-induced mucositis associate pain head neck cancer patient measure : 1 ) pain score Vanderbilt Head Neck Symptom Survey ( VHNSS version 2 . ) , 2 ) analgesic use . II . To determine whether pain control associate weight loss ( pound ) duration use percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy utilization ( day ) . III . To assess safety ( grade 3 4 adverse event ) tolerability use gabapentin ( discontinuation drug due side effect - yes ) . IV . To correlate pain severity frequency severity general systemic symptom . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Standard Care ( usual care ) - Patients receive consist oral health measure , oral rinsing , miracle mouthwash , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory , opioid analgesic . Patients also undergo education session begin chemoradiation treatment review foundation oral care pain management . ARM II : Standard Care plus Gabapentin - Patients receive standard care undergo education session Arm I . Patients also receive gabapentin orally ( PO ) three time day throughout chemoradiation treatment ( approximately 5-7 week ) mucositis resolve pain subsides . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 3 month .</detailed_description>
