	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis deleterious effect prion brain may mediate ( least partially ) activation serine proteases involve coagulation system . If true , measurement activity coagulation system may marker disease onset ( high risk individual E200K* carrier ) disease progression activity affect individual . In addition , modulation coagulation system activity may potential tool therapeutic intervention . *E200K- E200K mutation ( Glu Lys substitution ) prion protein gene</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan collect Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sample thrombin activity assay order test whether difference thrombin activity CSF CJD ( Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ) non-CJD patient . CSF sample obtain two source 1 . Patients familial sporadic CJD control patient neurodegenerative disorder ( e.g . SDAT** , NPH ) evaluate Sheba Medical Center 2 . From collaborate group Prof. Zerr German Prion Referral Center University Gottingen collection thousand CSF sample patient familial sporadic CJD well ideal control degenerative brain disease . The study 2 section : 1 . Prospective part plan recruit 25 patient CJD 25 patient type dementia Sheba Medical Center ( SMC ) . Prior inclusion study senior neurologist interview patient verify fully understand objective study mentally qualified sign inform consent form ( severely demented patient able adequately consider participation study exclude ) . Cognitive performance evaluate use Mini-mental Status Examination Frontal Assessment Battery scale . No clinical data cognitive assessment need clinical work especially collect study . 2 . Retrospective part CSF sample CJD patient patient type dementia ship u collaborator Germany an assay Thrombin activity . We plan recruit part study 100-200 CJD patient CSF sample number sample age match control . Thrombin activity ( sample part study ) assay follow : CSF sample place black 96 well dish ( 10 per well ) . Thrombin activity measure fluorometric assay , quantify cleavage synthetic peptide substrate Boc-Asp ( OBzl ) -Pro-Arg-AMC*** ( I-1560 , Bachem , Switzerland , 13 molar final concentration ) . Measurements perform Infinite 2000 microplate reader ( Tecan , infinite 200 , Switzerland ) excitation emission filter 360±35 460±35 nm , respectively . CSF test thrombin activity conduct Professor Chapman 's laboratory Sheba . This laboratory actively engage research role thrombin PAR-1 disease nervous system fully equip perform biochemical protein level experiment . The assay potential commercialization diagnostic test CJD . In addition , potential develop therapeutic agent target excessive thrombin activation . **SDAT=Senile Dementia Alzheimer Type ***AMC= Amino Methyl Coumarin</detailed_description>
