	<brief_summary>Damage pituitary gland frequently overlook potentially important complication traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Disorders pituitary gland cause dysfunction thyroid , adrenal , ovary testis . These disorder may occur immediately several month TBI , may delay recovery may significant negative impact quality life . TBI lead cause disability major permanent functional impairment among adult 45 year age . Hormonal deficit may contribute common symptom experience TBI survivor fatigue , poor concentration , depression low exercise capacity . However , association hormonal deficit disability remain uncertain . The primary objective pilot study assess feasibility large study evaluate impact pituitary disorder neurological disability functional recovery . The result study provide key finding impact pituitary disorder follow TBI , mandatory step prior test effect hormonal replacement therapy population costly clinical trial . If relationship pituitary disorder disability observe , investigator ' finding prevent unnecessary , time-consuming costly hormonal screening discourage potentially harmful hormonal therapy .</brief_summary>
