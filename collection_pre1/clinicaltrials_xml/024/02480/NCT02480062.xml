	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) diabetes leading cause premature ( &lt; 60 year ) adult death India projection indicate almost 3-fold increase 18 million premature year life lose 2030 . CVD diabetes result $ 336.6 billion lose national income India next decade . The major barrier control condition India low detection rate early course condition , inadequate use evidence base intervention low adherence intervention . After detection condition , long-term health outcome person affect heavily dependent adherence care guideline major priority . Harnessing potential Smartphone technology would solution address challenge community level improve quality care . There several advantage Smartphone technology make ideal tool improve quality care government facility . Smartphones/tablet computer low-cost , require less investment infrastructure ubiquitous use mass . Primary health care setting best suit address prevention management hypertension/diabetes risk factor . Given reason , Government India , plan scale-up National Program prevention control cancer , diabetes , cardiovascular disease stroke ( NPCDCS ) give major thrust screening , diagnosis management hypertension diabetes community level start NCD clinic Community Health Centres assign new role Health Workers sub-centers . In context , investigator plan develop tablet computer application Medical Officers Nurse enable deliver high quality care Community Health Centres ( CHCs ) . The tablet computer application capable run clinical risk score identify people high risk diabetes , cardiovascular disease , compute personalize management plan use evidence-based clinical management guideline . The feasibility effectiveness novel application formally evaluate order develop robust clinical decision support system Nurses Medical Officers public health facility . In brief , investigator plan implement research project 20 CHCs 2 state India i.e.Haryana Karnataka . Out , 10 CHCs receive mWellcare intervention . In intervention arm , NPCDCS Nurses register 30 years+ patient diagnose hypertension diabetes use tablet computer base Decision Support Software ( DSS ) . For patient identify hypertension/diabetes high risk , software provide individual tailor management plan would include treatment plan , lifestyle advice follow schedule . Thus , Medical Officers CHCs able prescribe guideline base management plan patient help DSS . The software store relevant health parameter patient local database ( tablet computer ) central server could access follow-up visit patient whenever require . To make meaningful comparison impact new technology enable service improve quality care diabetes hypertension CHCs , investigator collect data 10 CHCs provide routine/usual care patient . A structured training conduct Medical Officers Nurse CHCs ( intervention &amp; usual care arm ) evidence base management hypertension diabetes prior start project . The intervention carry period 1 year would include regular follow . The effect intervention assess six twelve month compare blood pressure blood glucose value patient two group . This project considerable importance fact utility tablet computer base clinical decision support system management hypertension diabetes public health facility evaluate develop country far . If find successful , technology potential upscale Haryana Karnataka across country government private healthcare setting .</detailed_description>
