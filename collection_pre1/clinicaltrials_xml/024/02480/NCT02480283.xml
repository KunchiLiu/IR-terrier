	<brief_title>Chronic Cannabis Smoking , Oxidative Stress Pulmonary Innate Immune Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I . Hypotheses Specific Aims : With change legislation , landscape cannabis use shifting ; data demonstrate public perception marijuana 's `` safety '' contribute increase usage commonly via inhale route ( smoke ) . The effect habitual cannabis smoke lung health , however , remain unclear . Spirometric data inconclusive regard risk airflow limitation development chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , find may attributable inaccurate reporting due former illegal nature . It seem clear , however , patient suffer increased incidence bronchitis symptom uncertain pathophysiologic mechanism . Animal data 1990s demonstrates cannabinoid exposure ( Tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) example ) result increase intra-pulmonary oxidative stress index immunomodulatory effect result abnormal macrophage function ; find may relate aforementioned symptom . However , data likely outmode give markedly increase ( THC ) content today 's cannabis sale ( 12 percent Tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) compare 3 percent 1990s ) . Furthermore , finding validate human subject . Thus , investigator hypothesize habitually smoke cannabis increase intrapulmonary oxidative stress result impaired alveolar macrophage ( AM ) phagocytosis , elicits attenuate AM response pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( PAMPs ) promote AM apoptosis thereby increase risk upper low airway infection . II . Background Significance : Cannabis use United States rise since legalization medical , recently , recreational purpose . The United Nations Office Drugs Crime estimate 2012 , cannabis legal medical purpose 17 state , illegal recreational consumption nationally , cannabis use among American population increase 11.5 % 12.1 % 23 . Over past 2 year , additional seven state legalize medical cannabis , Colorado Washington recently legalize sale recreational use . Since January 2014 , publicly available Colorado data indicate increase tax revenue cannabis sale ( medical recreational ) , suggest rise state-wide consumption relatively short period time24 . Effects modern inhale cannabis lung health establish . Published epidemiologic data collect prior widespread legalization cannabis commercialization cannabis industry demonstrate consistent association `` regular '' ( e.g . near daily ) `` heavy '' ( e.g . multiple year ) cannabis use poorer lung health11 ; 12 . Clinically , regular inhale cannabis user complain increased chronic bronchitis symptom ( eg . wheeze , chronic cough ) compare non-smokers8 ; increase use medical service respiratory infection due immunosuppressive effect drug also reported25 ; 26 . However , characterization cannabis use investigation varies widely , range 7 joint-years ( 1 joint per day 1 year ) 12 117 joint-years17 cohort examine . These study also potentially confound under-reporting cannabis use due drug 's illegal status , concomitant use inhale tobacco study populations10 . Moreover , quantity THC modern cannabis product increase past two decades6 ; 13 . Therefore , remain unclear use pattern modern inhale cannabis harmful lung health , although cannabis consume ever , medical recreational purpose . Today , due decriminalization cannabis sale purchase , accuracy self-reported cannabis use likely much great prior investigation , provide novel opportunity accurately establish pattern use associate ill effect health . Importantly , study date utilized time series analysis , time line follow-back ( TLFB ) , quantitate effect regular cannabis consumption association lung health . TLFB technique use extensively quantitate substance use among chronic user alcohol27 , tobacco28 , recently , cannabis 28 ; 29 . TLFB calendar-assisted , structured interview cue memory enhance accurate recall , determine reliable valid quantitating current substance use detail . TLFB interview characterize past 30 day cannabis use routinely conduct research subject Dr. Corsi 's ( co-mentor Dr. Biehl ) research group since 2010 , long term joint-year data collect well . Inhaled cannabis use adversely affect function alveolar macrophage ( AMs ) , critical pulmonary innate immune effectors30 . AMs express cannabinoid ( CB ) receptor , primarily CB2 , surface , whose ligand THC15 ( cannabinoid ) . AMs represent first line defense invade pathogen low airway , function keep lung sterile . Published investigation use AMs isolate via bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) small number ( n &lt; 20 ) habitual inhale cannabis user report inappropriately diminish response S. aureus , important lung pathogen . When AMs expose S. aureus , exhibit decreased bacterial phagocytosis killing ; hamper production pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-Î± , IL-6 , granulocyte monocyte colony stimulate factor ; decrease production nitric oxide16 ; 17 . Preclinical data suggest AM viability19 apoptosis20 may also adversely influenced THC dose- time-dependent manner CB2 receptor , impair AM 's ability respond pathogen . As mentioned , cannabis use increase per capita basis , continue use via inhaled route , THC quantity increase . Collectively , suggest possibility individual regularly use small dos inhale cannabis , use cannabis shorter length time , may still risk AM dysfunction , clinically manifest increased respiratory symptom increase risk pulmonary infection , particularly since pre-clinical data consistently report adverse effect cannabis exposure infectious disease resistance ( review 31 ) . Cannabis exposure vitro lead oxidative stress turn affect pulmonary cellular viability . Murine lung epithelial cell expose cannabis smoke extract vitro demonstrate dose-related increase oxidative stress22 , human lung BEAS-2B cell expose cannabis smoke extract vitro display increase reactive oxygen specie production21 . Enhanced oxidative stress investigation associate evidence cytotoxicity , characterize cellular apoptosis DNA damage . It seem possible , , enhance oxidative stress due habitual inhale cannabis may additionally influence viability function AMs low airway . However , effect inhale cannabis oxidative stress relationship AMs never specifically explored primary cell human subject . In summary , collaboration utilize validate method characterize regular chronic cannabis use pattern among exclusive medical and/or recreational cannabis user , order examine impact cell critical maintenance lung health . Information investigator derive may use counsel active contemplating cannabis user , inform medical provider researcher .</detailed_description>
