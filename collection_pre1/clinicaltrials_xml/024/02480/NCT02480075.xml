	<brief_title>Observational Study Linking Genetic Variants With Clinical Outcomes Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinicians treat pain noted response opioids pain medication varies widely among patient . Differences degree pain stimulation pain sensitivity , weight age difference , prior opioid use tolerance , well difference bioavailability various opioid formulation cite cause wide variability analgesia see opioids . However , significant component chronic pain may also explain genetic polymorphism . Genetic information may explain variability response help predict effective ( less dangerous ) treatment medication choice dos . By identify genetic risk effective analgesic individual patient , clinician may able improve efficacy pain treatment medication decrease risk iatrogenically-induced overdose , addiction , death . The purpose study evaluate currently available genetic test implement pain management set whether information result benefit patient care . Chronic pain patient receive routine medical visit care complete validate questionnaire measure pain level , disability index , mental health , quality life measurement clinical visit . Physicians document change make treatment regimen , include adjustment medication non-pharmacological treatment improvement pain , functional rating , patient satisfaction . Concomitantly , study use collect genetic clinical data create data registry order examine novel correlation association single nucleotide polymorphisms longitudinal datasets . The result study elucidate potential predictive variable chronic pain development and/or treatment assist make good healthcare decision selection treatment modality dose medication chronic pain .</detailed_description>
