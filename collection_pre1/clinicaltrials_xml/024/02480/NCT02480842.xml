	<brief_summary>Introduction : physical therapy essential prevent motor functional complication breast cancer surgery . However , prospective randomize study different physiotherapy approach patient undergo breast cancer surgery immediate reconstruction . Objectives : evaluate two physical therapy protocols patient breast cancer surgery immediate reconstruction . A group shoulder exercise limited range motion ( ROM ) 90 degree month surgery group limit ROM 15 day surgery . Specific objective : evaluate shoulder ROM pain one week surgery average , 07 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 180 day surgery ; ass motor function one week surgery average , 30 90 day surgery ; evaluate dehiscence seroma 07 , 15 , 30 , 60 90 day surgery ; associate incidence seroma dehiscence preoperative risk factor compare variable ( shoulder ROM , pain , motor function , seroma dehiscence ) two group . Methods : woman breast cancer , submit breast surgery ( radical conservative ) , follow immediate reconstruction : alloplastic ( tissue expander breast implant ) oncoplastic ( breast reduction contralateral symmetrization ) include . Patients submit bilateral oncology surgery , reconstruction autologous tissue breast surgery without reconstruction include . Patients recruit surgery scheduling undergo preoperative evaluation . At moment , preoperative analysis conduct personal data medical history . Patients undergo new assessment 07 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 180 day surgery . All patient receive standard physiotherapy treatment woman undergo breast reconstruction Physical Therapy Sector . The protocol consist early exercise , limit 90° shoulder ROM , start day surgery repeat 7 day surgery . After 15 day surgery , patient randomize two treatment protocol . One group start perform exercise free shoulder ROM . Patients tell limit movement feel pain . The group keep shoulder exercise limit 90° 30 day surgery . At moment ( one month surgery ) , also allow move shoulder restriction . The evaluation presence dehiscence seroma occur inspection palpation . Shoulder ROM investigate active goniometry flexion , extension , adduction , abduction , internal rotation external rotation . The pain assess Verbal Numerical Scale 0 to10 upper limb function DASH ( Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand Questionnaire ) questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial With Two Physical Therapy Protocols After Breast Cancer Surgery Immediate Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Patients recruit surgery scheduling . They undergo preoperative evaluation one week surgery average . At moment , preoperative analysis conduct personal data medical history . Patients undergo new assessment 07 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 180 day surgery , period describe PO 07 , PO 15 , PO 30 , PO 60 , PO 90 PO 180 . All patient receive standard physiotherapy treatment woman undergo breast reconstruction Physical Therapy Sector Mastology Discipline Department Gynecology Federal University São Paulo . The protocol consist early exercise , limit 90° shoulder range motion ( ROM ) , start day surgery repeat 7 day surgery . After 15 day surgery , patient randomize two treatment protocol . However , existence different type reconstructive surgery , randomization perform two group : - Alloplastic group : patient undergo reconstruction tissue expander breast implant - Oncoplastic Group : patient undergo mammaplasty / contralateral symmetrization Computer random sequence use randomization , group randomize Group A Group B . - Subgroup A : Patients start perform exercise free shoulder ROM . Patients tell limit movement feel pain . - Subgroup B : Patient keep shoulder exercise limit 90° 30 day surgery . At moment ( one month surgery ) , patient also allow move shoulder restriction At end randomization four subgroup : alloplastic A , alloplastic B , oncoplastic A oncoplastic B Outcomes : 1 . Shoulder range motion : The shoulder ROM assess goniometer flexion , extension , adduction , abduction , internal rotation external rotation . The movement perform actively . The patient position sit position . To assess shoulder flexion , upper limb neutral position elbow extension . Patient ask raise arm forward , close body . To assess extension , arm position 90° elbow flexion patient ask take arm back . For adduction , patient 90° shoulder flexion palm patient tell move arm medially . For study upper limb abduction , limb supination elbow extension patient ask raise arm side , along trunk line toward ear . For evaluation internal rotation external rotation upper limb place 90° shoulder abduction 90° elbow flexion . The patient ask rotate shoulder internally externally , respectively . 2 . Pain : The pain evaluate Verbal Scale Pain zero ten , zero pain ten unbearable pain . The patient ask pain moment evaluation , describe place degree pain . 3 . Upper limbs function : To investigate motor shoulder function DASH ( Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand Questionnaire ) questionnaire use . It assess functional capacity upper limb disease measure skill certain activity , well symptom . It consist 30 self-administered question two optional module , sport musical activity work activity . The 30 item evaluate degree difficulty performance activity ; intensity symptom pain , weakness , stiffness numbness ; commitment social activity ; difficulty sleep psychological commitment reference week precede instrument application . The final score range zero one hundred , high score , high upper limb dysfunction ( arm , shoulder hand ) . 4 . Dehiscence : Dehiscence wil assess inspection palpation . It describe `` presence '' `` absence '' dehiscence location . The wound condition describe , observation necrosis infection . Signs infection redness , hyperthermia secretion report . The size dehiscence describe : relation amount open point , case several open point ; centimeter ( assess per tape ) . Photographic record dehiscence do , good analysis comparison evolution . A Nikon Coolpix S3000 camera use . 5 . Seroma : The seroma evaluation perform inspection palpation . There description `` presence '' `` absence '' seroma , location number puncture make medical team drain quantity , necessary .</detailed_description>
