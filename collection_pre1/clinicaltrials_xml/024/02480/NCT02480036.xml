	<brief_title>Combining Intraoperative Radiotherapy With Kyphoplasty Treatment Spinal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disease Background : Bone metastases third common site metastatic spread , affect 10 % - 30 % cancer patient . The spine remain common site bone metastasis , incidence range 30-70 % depend primary tumour . Spinal metastasis significant cause morbidity cancer patient : severe pain , bone fracture , nerve root spinal cord compression , hypercalcemia , limited mobility . Symptomatic spinal metastasis frequently locate thoracic spine ( 70 % ) , follow lumbar spine ( 20 % ) cervical spine ( 10 % ) . Up 15 % cancer patient bone metastasis suffer compression fracture leading loss function impairment mobility , 70 % patient experience severe cancer-related pain affect quality life . Newer systemic agent target specific pathway molecule within tumor milieu lead dramatic improvement life expectancy metastatic patient . Hence , effective palliative treatment option spinal metastasis important clinical issue today 's oncologic practice . Current Practice : The majority patient spinal metastasis initially manage medically combination analgesic medication , bisphosphonates , biologic/chemotherapy agent . When patient develop severe pain refractory medical option concern neurologic dysfunction ( i.e . vertebrate fracture , nerve root compression ) , refer palliative radiotherapy surgical treatment option . In past decade , minimally invasive interventional therapy become popular treat severe pain spinal metastasis , especially patient evidence compression fracture . Vertebroplasty involve percutaneous injection cement vertebral body goal pain alleviation preventing loss vertebral body height . Similarly , kyphoplasty ( KYPHO ) , inflatable balloon use create cavity cement deposition , restores height well provide pain relief . However , immediate goal procedure achieve stabilization vertebral body prevent compression . Investigators assess safety efficacy vertebroplasty kyphoplasty pain palliation cancer patient . They perform ninety-seven procedure fifty-six patient . The median age 62 year . The procedure well-tolerated post-operative complication death note . There significant reduction visual analog pain score ( VAS ) : median pre-and postoperative VAS score 7 2 , respectively ( P=0.001 , student pair t-test ) . However , concern use kyphoplasty alone treatment spinal metastasis : rate re-treatment variable duration pain palliation . The rate new compression fracture balloon kyphoplasty patient malignant spinal fracture high 10 % . Non-surgical option treat spinal metastasis usually involve use external beam radiotherapy . The goal radiation therapy alleviate pain , stabilize affected bone , decrease tumor cell within treat site . Radiotherapy effective pain reduction , 50-80 % patient receive palliative radiation experience pain reduction . Pain reduction ionize radiation , theory , due direct analgesic effect nociceptors periosteum electrolyte shift , convert pain-inducing tissue acidosis tissue alkalosis . Furthermore , stabilization vertebral body achieve decreasing number tumor cell hence , thereby change imbalance osteoclast osteoblast activity . The latter effect increase re-mineralization . These effect occur 40-50 % patient radiation therapy , take 4-6 week external beam radiation therapy course . Several issue arise use external beam radiation therapy . First , optimal dose fraction schedule well- establish . The common prescribe dose 30 gray ( Gy ) ten fraction . However , Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 9714 , investigator find difference 8Gy single fraction versus extend 30Gy 10 fraction schedule term pain relief narcotic medication usage three month . Furthermore , extend radiotherapy course lead patient inconvenience , long hospitalization , increased toxicity . In RTOG 9714 trial , patient 30-Gy arm grade 2-4 toxicity 8-Gy arm . Furthermore , risk vertebral fracture patient treat radiation therapy spinal metastasis . Researchers report 31 % patient spinal cord compression treat radiotherapy alone vertebral collapse . Hence , achieve optimal treatment option symptomatic cancer patient spinal metastasis , next logical step would combine stabilization ( kyphoplasty ) technique direct tumor cell destruction order achieve maximum durable pain palliation , prevent potential neurological dysfunction , improve quality life . By combine kyphoplasty intraoperative radiation , one achieve mention goal single outpatient procedure . Combination Kyphoplasty Intraoperative Radiation : During surgical procedure , tumor bed and/or tumor irradiate single dose radiation . Intraoperative radiation therapy [ IORT ] delivery radiation surgical intervention . The advantage IORT consist high precision combine optimal protection surround organ risk . Hence , high dose radiation apply target ( compare external beam ) , minimize adverse side effect normal tissue . Furthermore , single dose corresponds least two three time time higher biological effective dose conventional fractionated external beam radiotherapy . Another potential advantage prevention tumor cell proliferation post-operative period prior start adjuvant radiotherapy . In study , investigator use low energy x-ray ( photon ) treat spine lesion kyphoplasty . The IORT device use Intrabeam® , miniature X-ray generator produce low-energy X-rays : electron accelerate voltage 30-50 kilovolt ( kV ) hit gold target tip drift tube . At point low-energy radiation generate emit isotropically , similar point source . Due sharp dose fall , minimal radiation protection require operating room . The ultimate goal treat tumor cell optimal spar spinal cord . ( Please refer Section 2.4 information Intrabeam® ) . Researchers University Medical Center Mannheim , Germany complete phase I trial assess tolerability Kypho-IORT procedure . Investigators report experience perform Kypho-IORT procedure 18 patient ( twenty-one vertebral lesion ) unstable painful spinal metastasis . The researcher use Intrabeam® deliver 8Gy 5mm distance spinal applicator surface use 50kV x-rays . The median age 63 year median follow 4.5 month ( range , 1-10 month ) . The procedure well-tolerated . The median surgical time 70 minute ( range , 53-173 minute ) , include radiation delivery time approximately two minute . Of 21 vertebral lesion , 18 treat successfully ( 86 % ) . During procedure , 78 % patient note asymptomatic paravertebral para-methoxymethamphetamine ( PMMA ) cement leakage . None treat patient delay wound healing , spinal nerve root compression , paresthesia , new neurological deficit , skin toxicity . In term pain relief , median visual analog pain score ( VAS ) 5 prior procedure . The VAS decrease 2.5 first post-procedure day . At six week , 12 18 patient available evaluate report median VAS score 0/10 . 67 % patient require analgesic medication pain relief prior procedure , decrease 30 % six week . Furthermore , image study available 15 18 patient , reveal 93 % ( 14/15 ) patient stable disease . Only one patient progressive disease base radiographic evidence , patient require additional intervention . INTRABEAM : The Intrabeam® machine delivers low energy 50-kV photon directly target volume . The device generate electron , accelerates seal vacuum probe ( drift tube , measure 10 cm long 3.2 mm outer diameter ) . This drift tube , locate within x-ray spectrometer ( XRS ) unit , incorporate gold target inside surface tip . When accelerated electron collide gold target end drift tube , photon generate dispersed isotropic dose distribution . The X-ray source mount balanced floor stand six degree freedom provide various treatment position . The Intrabeam® system calibrate quality assurance prior treatment . For Kypho-IORT procedure , specially design spinal applicator tip use . This sterile applicator tip consist plastic head , attach drift tube , place inside stainless steel tube ( metallic sleeve ) . The applicator tip protect drift tube bending . The applicator make plastic order minimize absorption attenuation photon . Under fluoroscopic guidance , applicator tip guide though metallic sleeve place mid-point/mid-plane vertebral lesion . Due steep dose fall-off , high dose vertebral lesion deliver , maximum spar spinal cord . A radiation dose 8 Gy distance 5 mm applicator surface prescribe . This correlate approximate dose 91 Gy applicator surface , 45 Gy distance 1mm ( applicator surface ) , 27Gy 2mm , 8Gy 5mm . Further dose fall approximate : 2.4Gy 10mm , 0.8Gy 15mm , 0.4Gy 20mm . Assuming minimal distance 15mm spinal cord , , spinal cord would receive less 1Gy . Study Design : The combination intraoperative radiotherapy kyphoplasty provide immediate vertebra stabilization , durable pain relief , sterilization tumor cell single outpatient procedure . To date , procedure perform United States . The investigator plan conduct phase I trial Kypho-IORT Loyola University Medical Center .</detailed_description>
