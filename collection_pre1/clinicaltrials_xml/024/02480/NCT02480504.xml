	<detailed_description>Background : The optimal diet treat obesity cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk still clarify . Could five plus two diet , form intermittent energy restriction lead good adherence , similar weight loss reduction CVD risk factor isocaloric continuous energy restriction obese subject . Methods : The study randomize controlled clinical trial 120 men woman 21 70 year BMI ( BMI 30-45 kg/m2 ) , stable weight within ±3 kg last 3 month 1 additional metabolic syndrome risk component . Dietary intervention : Randomization one two diet group . Participants intervention group follow av 5:2 diet participant control group follow isocaloric continuous energy restriction . Primary research question : Compare effect weight reduction intermittent energy restriction isocaloric continuous energy restriction obese subject ? Secondary research question Compare effect intermittent energy restriction isocaloric continuous energy restriction cardiometabolic risk factor tolerability safety obese subject . The project consist randomize controlled clinical trial .</detailed_description>
