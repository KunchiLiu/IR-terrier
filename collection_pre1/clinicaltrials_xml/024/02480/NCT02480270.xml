	<brief_summary>This study plan learn effect oral antibiotic outpatient pulmonary exacerbation ( respiratory illness ) sputum ( mucus ) bacterial infection , lung function , airway inflammation quality life . In study subject perform pulmonary function test , provide sputum sample complete questionnaire two separate clinic visit . If subject unable cough sputum clinic ask breathe salt water solution help cough sputum . The first sputum sample obtain first visit ( within 48 hour start antibiotic ) . Pulmonary function test questionnaire also complete time . Subjects complete two week course oral antibiotic home . During two week subject ask write time antibiotic take airway clearance ( vest treatment ) perform . Within one week complete antibiotic course subject return clinic second visit . At time sputum sample obtain subject unable cough sputum ask breathe salt water solution help cough sputum . Pulmonary function test questionnaire also complete second visit . Sputum sample test infection bacteria virus . Sputum sample also use measure marker airway inflammation ( swell ) . The investigator hypothesize use two week oral antibiotic treatment pulmonary exacerbation result decrease amount bacteria measure sputum . Additionally investigator hypothesize treatment antibiotic lead improvement lung function , decrease airway inflammation improvement quality life measurement .</brief_summary>
