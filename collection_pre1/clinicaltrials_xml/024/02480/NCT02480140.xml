	<brief_title>Self-regulated Constraint-induced Movement Therapy Subacute Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Emerging research suggest use self-regulation ( SR ) strategies improve functional regain patient brain injury . SR propose produce added effect effective constraint-induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) . Objective - This study aim examine efficacy self-regulated CIMT program ( SR-CIMT ) function regain patient sub-acute stroke . Methods - Seventy-six patient randomly assign self-regulated constraint-induced movement therapy ( SR-CIMT ; n=25 ) , constraint-induced movement therapy ( CIMT ; n=27 ) conventional functional rehabilitation ( control ; n=24 ) group , complete trial . The SR-CIMT intervention two-week therapist-guided training use SR strategy reflect relearn functional task CIMT . Outcome measurement upper limb function ( Action Research Arm Test , ARAT , Fugl-Meyer Assessment , FMA ) , daily task performance ( Lawton Instrumental Activities Daily Living Scale , Lawton IADL ) self-perceived functional ability ( Motor Activity Log , MAL ) pre post intervention interval , one month follow .</detailed_description>
