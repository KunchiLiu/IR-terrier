	<brief_title>The Clinical And Subclinical Effects Arterial Stiffness Bosentan Patients With Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Digital ischemia major problem patient Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) , especially underlie connective tissue disease systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) . SSc hallmarked microvascular disease assess nailfold capillary microscopy ( NCM ) identify specific capillary pattern . However , appear vascular damage restrict capillary , may also extend upstream hand forearm artery . This may reflect clinically relevant structural abnormality obliteration , also decrease arterial function . The best characterised RP occurrence vasospasms cold exposure . However , evidence point major stiffen artery also occur , potentially exaggerate digital ischemia vascular complication SSc . Objective : To investigate whether bosentan add usual care improve arterial stiffness 3 month measure pulse wave velocity medium large artery correct blood pressure change patient systemic sclerosis digital ulcer . Intervention : Group 1 : Usual care AND bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily , titrate 125 mg twice daily one month tolerate ( n=20 ) Group 2 : Usual care ( n=20 ) Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Bosentan register product Netherlands . In study , use within indication combination product register . Therefore additional unknown uncertainty increase overall risk applicable investigational product . In usual care group , treatment differ clinical practice . To minimize risk patient receive appropriate treatment control group , regular visit lab assessment plan . Patients allow start bosentan usual care group indicate treat physician . The study consist one screening three study visit . During latter , patient clinical sign symptom assess , vascular lab perform , blood drawn , subject ask fill questionnaire , duration 2 hour per visit . In total 3 time 24cc blood collect , preferably combination routine lab assessment . These measure render risk acceptable burden minimal subject participate study .</detailed_description>
