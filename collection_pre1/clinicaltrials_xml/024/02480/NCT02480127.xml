	<brief_summary>Repeated implantation failure ( RIF ) determine failure implantation occur least three consecutive IVF attempt least one high-grade embryo transfer cycle . Several method suggest improve implantation rate RIF patient . One promise method local injury endometrium . It report rate implantation , clinical pregnancy , live birth reach double RIF patient local endometrial injury patient without . The population study include infertile couple attend Royan Institute , least three consecutive cycle ART failure . Also study phase 3 randomized clinical trial . Based average menstrual cycle 30-28 day , endometrial blood sample collect two group patient day 21 luteal phase spontaneous menstrual cycle . The intervention , control group underwent prior biopsy treatment follicular phase day 8 or/and 11 13 cycle day blood sample group collect . To investigate impact local endometrial injury increase rate pregnancy ART - treat RIF patient , investigator examine change immunological factor involve implantation include cytokine , growth factor ( serum endometrial biopsy ) expression TLRs HOX gene ( endometrial biopsy ) obtain group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study phase 3 randomized clinical trial 20 infertile woman follow condition study 2 group . In intervention group , Endometrial sampling obtain twice Pipelle [ one follicular phase ( 8-9 11- 13 day begin buserelin cycle ) last luteal phase ( 19-21 20-23 day ) precede embryo transfer cycle precede embryo transfer cycle ] . In control group endometrial sample do luteal phase cycle precede embryo transfer cycle . Blood sample ( 5- 10 cc ) take group twice ( one 9-8 11- 13 day 19-21 20-23 day precede embryo transfer cycle ) .</detailed_description>
