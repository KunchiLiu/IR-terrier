	<brief_summary>Allogeneic transplant sometimes effective treatment leukemia . In traditional allogeneic transplant , patient receive high dos chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy , follow infusion donor 's bone marrow blood stem cell . The high-dose chemotherapy drug radiation give remove leukemia cell body . The infusion donor 's bone marrow blood stem cell give replace diseased bone marrow destroy chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy . However , risk associate allogeneic transplant . Many people life-threatening even fatal complication , like severe infection condition call graft-versus-host disease , cause cell donor attack normal tissue transplant patient . Recently , several hospital around world use different type allogeneic transplant call microtransplant . In type transplant , donor usually family member exact match . In microtransplant , leukemia patient get low dos chemotherapy use traditional allogeneic transplant . The chemotherapy follow infusion donor 's peripheral blood stem cell . The objective microtransplant suppress bone marrow give enough chemotherapy allow donor cell temporarily engraft ( implant ) , low level . The hope donor cell cause body mount immunologic attack leukemia , generate response call `` graft-versus-leukemia '' effect `` graft-versus-cancer '' effect , without cause potentially serious complication graft-versus-host disease . With research study , investigator hope find whether microtransplantation safe effective treatment child , adolescent young adult relapse refractory hematologic malignancy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : - To assess safety feasibility standard chemotherapy plus GCSF-mobilized Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell , Apheresis ( HPC-A ) pediatric patient relapse refractory hematologic malignancy . - To estimate response rate standard chemotherapy plus GCSF-mobilized HPC-A pediatric patient relapse refractory hematologic malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To describe event-free overall survival patient treated standard chemotherapy plus GCSF-mobilized HPC-A . - To estimate time neutrophil platelet recovery treatment standard chemotherapy plus GCSF-mobilized HPC-A . - To determine cumulative incidence acute chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . OTHER PRESPECIFIED OBJECTIVES : - To characterize donor chimerism microchimerism . Patients receive standard chemotherapy follow infusion donor peripheral blood mononuclear cell 2 day completion chemotherapy . Patients least partial response eligible receive second cycle . Diagnostic lumbar puncture intrathecal ( IT ) chemotherapy give prior cycle 1 . Patients without evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) leukemia receive IT therapy cycle 1 . Patients CNS disease receive weekly IT therapy ( age-adjusted methotrexate , hydrocortisone , cytarabine ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) become free leukemia ( minimum 4 dos ) . Bone marrow aspiration ( BMA ) biopsy ass response perform approximately day 29 therapy . For hematopoietic stem cell mobilization , donor receive G-CSF ( Filgrastim ) ( Neupogen® ) day 5 day give subcutaneously ( SQ ) prior HPC-A collect leukapheresis day 6 .</detailed_description>
