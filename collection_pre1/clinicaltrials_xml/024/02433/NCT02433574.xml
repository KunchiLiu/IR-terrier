	<brief_summary>Despite improve stag operative technique , rate incomplete resection ( R1 ) NSCLC remain significant last decade . Patients R1 resection significantly bad survival compare complete resection ( R0 ) . This phase I study investigates feasibility safety deliver Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy ( SBRT ) patient locally invasive NSCLC ( cT3-4 , N0-1 ) risk incomplete resection . Twenty patient NSCLC treat SBRT follow surgery appropriate adjuvant therapy . Patients divide group , 5 patient , treat escalate dos ( 35 , 40 , 45 50 Gy ) 10 daily fraction . The primary outcome feasibility i.e . ability complete safely SBRT surgery ( within 6 week ) . Secondary outcome include acute late adverse event , R0/R1/R2 rate secondary surrogate feasibility . If successful , study lead evaluation pre-operative SBRT NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients include age 18 year old , biopsy proven NSCLC , clinically stag T3T4 marginally resectable i.e . deem risk achieve &lt; R0 resection ( invasion critical mediastinal hilar structure , nodal extracapsular extension , chest wall , vertebral body , compromise bronchial stump margin , base CT image chest ) . Patients also need pathologically stag N01 disease , SBRT CTV≤200cm3 , base planning CT image . ECOG status require &lt; 2 within 4 week prior registration patient must deem medically operable surgical team . Patients exclude deem medically inoperable surgical team weight loss ≥10 % within 3 month prior pathological diagnosis . Patients also absolute contraindication RT connective tissue disease , pacemakerdependent patient pacemaker receive high tolerance dose , previous RT current region study , would result overlap RT field , patient must plan receive local therapy study , except disease progression , patient malignancy within 2 year prior study ( nonmelanomatous skin cancer )</criteria>
