	<brief_title>The Effects NOx Conjugated Linoleic Acid Asthmatics With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity asthma comorbidity associate increased severity , poor control , reduce steroid responsiveness great exacerbation healthcare utilization rate . These association explain great degree Th-2 inflammation . Rather , obese asthma phenotype define several cluster study , paradoxically reduce level Th-2 biomarkers , include sputum eosinophil exhale nitric oxide ( NO ) . The investigator previous research show inverse relation increase body mass index ( BMI ) reduce exhaled NO , may explain metabolic imbalance characterize low L-arginine great asymmetric di-methyl arginine ( ADMA ) level . Having low L-arginine/ADMA ratio show inhibit uncouple isoforms nitric oxidase synthase ( NOS ) , thereby reduce NO bioavailability promote oxidative stress enhance superoxide production . In obese asthmatic , imbalance correlate exhale NO , also low FEV1 % poor asthma-related quality life . Yet effect obesity asthma unlikely solely dependent single mechanism . Other factor , increase Th1 Th-17-mediated inflammation show occur human animal model . Given potential avenue , imperative intervention sufficiently pleiotropic , addition restore airway NO level , also reduce obesity-related non-Th2 mechanism inflammation . The investigator hypothesize treatment conjugate linolenic acid ( CLA ) + nitrate nitrite ( together know NOx ) , restore NO airway bioavailability , reduce oxidative stress improve airway inflammation obese asthmatic . To test hypothesis , investigator propose phase II pilot study obese asthmatic metabolic syndrome , treat orally CLA+NOx 12 week , open label study design assess pre post-intervention change airway systemic biomarkers , determine effect lung function bronchial hyperresponsiveness . Participants undergo pre post intervention bronchoscopy . The result obtain project greatly informative understand obese - asthma pathophysiology development clinical trial determine potential benefit intervention improve health outcome .</detailed_description>
