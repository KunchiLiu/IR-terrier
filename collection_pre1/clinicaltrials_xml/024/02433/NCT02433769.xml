	<brief_summary>Muscle relaxant administer patient undergo general anesthesia order facilitate placement endotracheal tube improve operating condition . Despite routine reversal agent , many patient arrive recovery room evidence residual muscle weakness . Many study demonstrate residual neuromuscular blockade ( weakness ) common occurrence surgery . The method reliably detect presence perioperative neuromuscular blockade use quantitative neuromuscular monitor . These device measure quantify degree muscle weakness display result screen . When use train-of-four ( TOF ) nerve stimulation , ratio fourth muscle contraction ( twitch ) first twitch displayed ; ratio 90 % ( 0.9 ) great , full recovery muscle strength present , endotracheal tube safely remove . At present time , one commercially-available stand-alone quantitative monitor available United States -the TOF-Watch ( acceleromyography device ) . It use many clinician require experience obtain accurate result , expensive , subject interference factor operate room . The aim investigation examine new quantitative monitor , TOFscan ( new three dimensional acceleromyography device ) . In order study accuracy new device , TOFscan compare current `` clinical gold standard '' , TOF-Watch-SX .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>30 patient present elective surgical procedure expect duration great 60 minute enrol study . ASA I III patient require neuromuscular blockade operating room eligible enrollment . All neuromuscular management conduct recommend Good Clinical Research Practice ( GCRP ) pharmacodynamic study neuromuscular block agent guideline Monitoring consist standard ASA monitor , include manual blood pressure measurement , continuous EKG monitoring , pulse oximetry , capnography , infrared gas analysis . The placement TOFscan dominant non-dominant hand determine use computer-generated randomization table . The TOF-Watch-SX place hand . Anesthetic induction per usual routine clinical care , consist propofol 2.0-2.5 mg/kg fentanyl 100 μg ; rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg give 5 second fast-running IV baseline neuromuscular data collect . General anesthesia maintain sevoflurane 1.0-3.0 % , concentration inhalational agent adjust maintain blood pressure within 20 % baseline value . The depth anesthesia also adjust maintain Bispectral Index ( BIS monitor ) value 40-60 , per usual clinical practice . Core temperature maintain &gt; 35°C hand temperature &gt; 32°C use upper extremity warm blanket . Additional dos rocuronium administer ( 5-10 mg ) require surgical relaxation ( TOF count 2-3 TOF stimulation ) . No NMBAs administer last 20 minute procedure . At completion surgery , neuromuscular blockade reverse neostigmine 50 µg/kg plus glycopyrrolate , per usual standard care . Upon arrival operating room , neuromuscular monitoring surface electrode apply . All monitoring conduct patient general anesthesia surgical procedure . Surface electrodes ( non-invasive EKG electrode ) place cleansed skin ulnar nerve arm near wrist . The electrode connect lead nerve stimulator component TOF-Watch-SX one arm TOFscan arm . The transducer ( AMG sensor measure acceleration ) TOF-Watch-SX place thumb corresponding hand . A 75-150g preload ( via Hand adapter ) apply per standard recommendation . On hand , transducer ( three-dimensional AMG sensor ) TOFscan place thumb use integrated hand adapter . During surgical procedure , device activate simultaneously , response nerve stimulation record . After induction anesthesia , administration rocuronium , calibration stable baseline signal achieve TOF-Watch-SX TOFscan suggest Good Clinical Research Guidelines . After baseline data collect , neuromuscular blocking agent ( rocuronium ) administer . Data relating onset ( TOF ratio decrease 1.0 0.3 less TOF-Watch-SX display ) , maintenance ( TOF ratio less 0.3 constant TOF-Watch-SX display ) , reversal ( increase TOF ratio 0.2 0.9 ) record . At time , data TOFscan record . Monitoring continue full recovery neuromuscular function note ( TOF ratio least 0.9 great TOF-Watch-SX device display ) . At time , anesthesia agent turn patient awakened extubated . After surgery , data record simultaneously TOF-Watch-SX TOFscan compare .</detailed_description>
