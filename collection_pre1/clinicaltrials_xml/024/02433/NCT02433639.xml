	<brief_summary>Biliary tract cancer relatively rare cancer , generally poor prognosis . In metastatic/recurrent biliary tract cancer , commonly use 1st-line chemotherapy gemcitabine+cisplatin combination . However , standard 2nd-line chemotherapy validate target therapeutic agent , even though tumor harbor diverse genetic characteristic . TH-302 ( 1-methyl-2-nitro-1H-imidazole-5-yl ) methyl N , N'-bis ( 2-bromoethyl ) diamidophos-phate nitroimidazole-linked prodrug brominate version isophosphoramide mustard ( Br-IPM ) . When exposed hypoxic condition , TH-302 reduce nitroimadazole site prodrug intracellular reductase lead release Br-IPM . Br-IPM act DNA crosslinking agent . In area normoxia , TH-302 remain intact prodrug toxicity minimize . In addition , preclinical data suggest activation , active moiety may diffuse area outside hypoxic region , demonstrate `` bystander '' effect possibly exhibit additional anti-tumor activity . It well know biliary tract cancer hypovascular tumor , contain large hypoxic area tumor . Therefore would worthy test TH-302 biliary tract cancer . This study phase II study TH-302 monotherapy second-line treatment advance biliary tract cancer , investigate efficacy safety TH-302 monotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Biliary tract cancer relatively rare disease worldwide among kind solid tumor . However incidence biliary tract cancer relatively higher Korea compare western country . The prognosis biliary tract cancer poor , , 5-year overall survival rate 26.7 % . The main reason poor prognosis : 1 ) screen method detect early stage , 2 ) relapse rate curative surgery high , 3 ) metastatic/recurrent biliary tract cancer , chemo-sensitivity relatively low . And another important reason poor prognosis low interest investigator . So researches new agent limited compare type cancer lung cancer , breast cancer colon cancer etc . In metastatic/recurrent biliary tract cancer , available cytotoxic chemotherapy compose gemcitabine , cisplatin , 5-FU , etc . The commonly use 1st-line chemotherapy gemcitabine+cisplatin combination . ( N Engl J Med 2010 ; 362 ( 14 ) : 1273-81 ) There standard 2nd-line chemotherapy far . The overall survival cytotoxic chemotherapy 8-10 month . So far , validate target therapeutic agent biliary tract cancer , even though tumor harbor diverse genetic characteristic . Therefore , huge unmet medical need biliary tract cancer . TH-302 ( 1-methyl-2-nitro-1H-imidazole-5-yl ) methyl N , N'-bis ( 2-bromoethyl ) diamidophos-phate nitroimidazole-linked prodrug brominate version isophosphoramide mustard ( Br-IPM ) . When exposed hypoxic condition , TH-302 reduce nitroimadazole site prodrug intracellular reductase lead release Br-IPM . Br-IPM act DNA crosslinking agent . Tumors often consist large area highly hypoxic region know resistant chemotherapy radiation treatment . In area normoxia , TH-302 remain intact prodrug toxicity minimize . Thus , TH-302 design target highly hypoxic tumor region make attractive candidate clinical development . In addition , preclinical data suggest activation , active moiety may diffuse area outside hypoxic region , demonstrate `` bystander '' effect possibly exhibit additional anti-tumor activity . It well know biliary tract cancer hypovascular tumor , contain large hypoxic area tumor . Therefore would worthy test TH-302 biliary tract cancer . This study phase II study TH-302 monotherapy second-line treatment advance biliary tract cancer .</detailed_description>
