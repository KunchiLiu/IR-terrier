	<brief_summary>This study assess 18-month incidence inappropriate shock subject implant EMBLEM Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator ( S-ICD ) primary prevention sudden cardiac death . Devices program zone cutoff 200 bpm 250 bmp order mimic programming setting transvenous ICDs MADIT RIT study . The incidence inappropriate S-ICD shock compare incidence inappropriate shock observe MADIT RIT study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) therapy highly effective reduce mortality patient clinical marker elevate risk ventricular arrhythmia . However , inappropriate shock unnecessary appropriate shock remain important side effect significantly affect ICD recipient 's quality life may deleterious myocardium . The MADIT RIT study demonstrate incidence inappropriate unnecessary appropriate ICD therapy reduce primary prevention patient two different program strategy : 1 ) High Rate Zone Cutoff , i.e. , raise low rate detection cutoff 200 bpm ; 2 ) Delayed Therapy Initiation , i.e. , increase time therapy initiation 60 second arrhythmias detect 170-199 bpm 12.5 second 200-249 bpm . Both strategy effectively reduce amount ICD therapy deliver compare conventional programming , low rate detection cutoff 170 bpm delay therapy initiation program 2.5 second . Importantly , neither treatment arm associate significantly increase syncope mortality . The result MADIT RIT establish preferred device setting reduce shock transvenous ICD ( TV-ICD ) patient primary prevention indication . Preferred settings subcutaneous ICDs , however , establish data prospective study . The UNTOUCHED study test program scheme design minimize inappropriate unnecessary shock patient indication primary prevention sudden cardiac death low ejection fraction . Although S-ICD program option permit exact replication program setting previously show reduce shock MADIT RIT treatment arm , key element combine UNTOUCHED setting test protocol . It hypothesize despite lack anti-tachycardia pacing , EMBLEM S-ICD setting utilize study result overall shock incidence similar observe ICD patient MADIT RIT .</detailed_description>
