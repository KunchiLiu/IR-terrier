	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Protective Efficacy Single Dose Trivalent Live Attenuated Dengue Vaccine Protect Against Infection With DENV-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 4 type dengue virus ( DENV-1 , DENV-2 , DENV-3 , DENV-4 ) , capable cause dengue illness range mild illness life-threatening disease . This study evaluate trivalent live attenuate dengue admixture vaccine contain 3 different monovalent dengue vaccine candidate , represent 3 4 dengue serotypes ( DENV-1 , DENV-3 , DENV-4 ) . Study researcher evaluate safety protective efficacy single dose trivalent dengue vaccine viremia rash induce infection attenuate DENV-2 virus ( rDEN2Δ30-7169 ) , administer 6 month trivalent dengue vaccine . This study enroll healthy adult history previous flavivirus infection . At Day 0 ( study entry ) , participant randomly assign receive either trivalent dengue vaccine admixture placebo . On Day 180 , participant receive rDEN2Δ30-7169 vaccine . Study visit occur Days 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 21 , 28 , 56 , 90 , 150 , 180 , 184 , 186 , 188 , 190 , 192 , 194 , 196 , 201 , 208 , 236 , 270 , 360 .
