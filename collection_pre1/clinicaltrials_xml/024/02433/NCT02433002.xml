	<detailed_description>The eGFR-C study ass accuracy current alternative test kidney function reference test people moderate ( stage 3 ) CKD . Participants recruit hospital clinic General Practitioner ( GP ) practice six major United Kingdom ( UK ) centre . The best measure kidney function accept glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , measure ability kidney filter blood widely use clinical practice . A low GFR suggest poor kidney function . An estimate GFR obtain simple blood test . Participants undergo reference GFR test study entry second follow-up reference test three year later . The reference test involve inject small amount iohexol vein take blood sample next 4 hour see quickly iohexol disappears blood stream result glomerular filtration . The rate iohexol disappear equivalent level kidney function . Blood test monitor kidney function , include test creatinine cystatin C , measurement urinary albumin do every six month study period . Iohexol measure GFR accept reference ( 'gold standard ' ) measure kidney function GFR-estimating equation compare . The alternative estimated measure GFR , derive measuring substance ( creatinine cystatin C ) blood , compare reference test . An important outcome much reference test change three year study , well surrogate measure reflect change . The investigator also collect accurate test cost data subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis ( e.g . relative cost test justify change practice due improve performance one test compare another ? ) .</detailed_description>
