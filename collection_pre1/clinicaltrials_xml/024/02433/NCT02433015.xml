	<brief_title>Neurophysiological Immunological Effects Transition From Combustible Electronic Cigarettes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants current cigarette smoker randomly assign either experimental control group . Following baseline psychiatric assessment session , subject return study center two three additional follow-up visit . During second visit , subject undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan session , perform series functional neuroimaging task design examine neural substrate involve visceral interoception eat behavior . Prior start scan session , blood sample collect subject , measurement bio-markers related nicotine use peripheral inflammation . After end second visit , subject within experimental group ask switch combustible electronic cigarette . Subjects within control group continue smoke combustible cigarettes previously . During third visit , follow two eight week second visit , subject provide second blood sample complete second fMRI scan session . Both group participant complete fMRI task second visit .</detailed_description>
