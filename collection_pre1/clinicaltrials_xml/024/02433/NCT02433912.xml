	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Several procedure report surgical correction gingival recession ( GR ) , include laterally position flap ( LPF ) coronally advanced flap ( CAF ) , perform single two-stage procedure without , respectively , precede placement heal free gingival graft ( FGG ) . The objective present report compare efficacy single-stage LPF CAF technique treatment localize maxillary GR defect . METHODS : Thirty-six patient Miller class I GR defect randomly assign treat either CAF ( n=18 ) LPF ( n=18 ) . Clinical parameter , include recession height ( RECH ) , width keratinize tissue ( WKT ) , probe depth ( PD ) vertical clinical attachment level ( VAL ) assess mid-buccal site . Visual plaque score ( VPS ) bleed probe ( BOP ) also assess dichotomously . Clinical recording perform baseline , 6 month 5 year later . Inter-measurements difference analyze Chi-square Wilcoxon test , significance set α &lt; 0.05 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Population Experimental Design The study design randomize , prospective , parallel-arm , control clinical trial . It conduct accordance guideline Helsinki Declaration 1975 , revise 2000 , approve institutional review board approval . Written inform consent obtain patient thorough explanation nature , risk , benefit clinical investigation associate procedure . The study population consist patient referred periodontal treatment School Dentistry , Federal Fluminense University , Brazil . The following inclusion criterion use : adult patient contraindication periodontal surgery , take medication know interfere periodontal tissue health heal precede 6 month , exhibit presence Miller class I gingival recessions5 maxillary incisor , canine premolar , probe depth ( PD ) &lt; 3mm without bleed probing , present tooth vitality absence caries restoration area treat . Patients untreated periodontal disease , smoker , subject immunosuppressive systemic disease ( i.e. , cancer , AIDS , diabetes ) include study . Miller class II , III class IV recession defects5 , presence apical radiolucency caries restoration area treat , previous lack cooperation maintenance program also exclusion criterion . Thirty-six patient ( 10 men 26 woman ) , average age 34 ± 7 year , include present prospective study June 2002 December 2006 . Sample size determine Power analysis , assume α .05 , two-tailed z value 1.96 standart deviation 0.72 . This calculation indicate sample 16 subject , study would &gt; 90 % power detect 1-mm difference recession depth two group . All patient subject initial periodontal therapy adherent maintenance care least six month begin study . Treatment include oral hygiene instruction , scale root planning need , tooth polish plaque control measure correction traumatic tooth brush technique negative habit . All patient instruct trained use soft toothbrush eliminate habit relate etiology recession . Baseline full mouth plaque bleed score low . Each defect ( one defect per patient ) randomly assign one two treatment modality employ : coronally advance flap ( CAF ) ( n=18 ) laterally-positioned flap ( LPF ) ( n=18 ) toss coin . Clinical data collection Clinical parameter assess previously described3 mid-buccal site teeth use cemento-enamel junction ( CEJ ) , applicable , another define landmark , fix reference point REC record . All measurement record use UNC # 15 periodontal probe ( PCPUNC 15 - Hu-Friedy , Chicago , USA ) rubber stopper blind , train calibrate examiner , unaware treatment provide , baseline 6 month surgery . Measurements record near high mm . The point maximum convexity marginal gingival contour - gingival zenith ( GZ ) - employ reference measurement gingival margin ( GM ) . Visual plaque score ( VPS ) bleed probe ( BOP ) assess dichotomously mid-buccal location . Recession height ( RECH ) measure distance CEJ GM . The width keratinize tissue ( WKT ) measure distance GM MGJ . PD measure distance GM bottom gingival sulcus . Probing depth gingival recession use calculate vertical clinical attachment level ( VAL ) . Surgical Procedures Before surgery , patient give single dose 500 mg sodic dipyrone analgesic . Intraoral antisepsis perform 0.12 % chlorhexidine rinse . Anesthesia obtain regional block 2.0 % Lidocaine 1:100.000 epinephrine . Coronally Advanced Flap ( CAF ) . The CAF design perform two vertical release incision mesial distal aspect recession treat , way proximal papilla include part flap . Papillae never bisect . Beveled vertical incision perform attached gingiva , avoid formation butt-joints flap adjacent tissue , continue several millimeter apically alveolar mucosa . The vertical incision join intrasulcular incision . In interproximal area , papillae split mesio-distal dimension , result flat surface connective tissue contact flap tissue retain portion papilla reposition suture flap . A combined mucoperiosteal-mucosal flap elevate first 3-4mm coronal aspect alveolar bone expose , remain buccal bone still cover periosteum gingival connective tissue . Thorough root planning perform hand , rotary ultrasonic instrument . A fine-grain finishing bur always use reduce convexity root surface remove sharp edge groove . After instrumentation , root surface wash saline solution attempt remove remain detached fragment defect surgical field . A complementary horizontal incision perform apical aspect flap , release attach periosteum . This allowed elongation free coronal positioning flap . The flap coronally position maintained place mean individual 5.0 monofilament suture . Laterally Positioned Flap The surgical procedure LPF perform accord standard techniques1 . The receptor site prepare use surgical blade . Incisions make - mesial distal - aspect recession , order remove epithelial attachment obtain connective tissue surface , extend several millimeter apically toward alveolar mucosa . These incision carry obtain external bevel recipient site tooth treat , internal bevel adjacent aspect flap way flap rotate sutured receptor site buttjoint relationship stablished , large surface contact connective tissue flap receptor site establish . The excised gingival tissue remove , root surface instrument describe . The flap design outline two vertical incision extend horizontal incison several millimeter apically mucogingival junction . A horizontal incision perform either gingival , 1 - 2mm apically , follow marginal gingival contour , thus join vertical incision . When donor site edentulous site , bevel linear horizontal incision perform optimize content keratized tissue flap . The flap elevate full-thickness portion adjacent recession partial thickness portion distal recession . Partial-thickness dissection continue apically laterally order obtain passivity flap movement absence muscle pull periosteal adhesion . The flap rotate laterally order completely cover recession defect extend approximatelly 1mm coronal CEJ . Careful flap suture perform order position secure soft tissue root surface mean sling simple suture . Post-Surgical Care The patient put systemic analgesic consist 750 mg paracetamol ( ** ) every six hour four day . A surgical dressing ( *** ) change seven day remove fourteen day group . The patient instruct continue regular home hygiene care , except operated area , tooth-brushing discontinue first 30 day surgery plaque control maintain mean gentle topical application chlorhexidine gluconate ( 2.0 % ) saturate cotton swab twice day . Gentle tooth-brushing extra soft-bristle toothbrush initiate . The suture remove two week surgery . Maintenance Schedule Following surgery , patient see weekly first three month bi-weekly next three month . Maintenance visit consist reinforcement oral hygiene procedure professional supra-gingival coronal polishing . Additional oral chemical plaque control perform every three month mean mouth rinse solution chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12 % BID , one week . Statistical Analysis All descriptive statistic express mean +/- standard deviation ( SD ) . Baseline measurement subject inter-group comparison , analyze non-parametric Wilcoxon test Chi-square test . Inter-group intra-group comparison baseline six-month measurement analyze Wilcoxon test Chi-square test . Wilcoxon 's signed rank test use intra-group comparison Wilcoxon 's rank sum test use inter-group comparison . Statistical significance set 95 % probability level ( P &lt; 0.05 ) .</detailed_description>
