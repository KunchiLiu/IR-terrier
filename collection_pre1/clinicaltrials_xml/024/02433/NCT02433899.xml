	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : The semilunar coronally reposition flap ( SLCRF ) use treatment recession defect ( GR ) . Recently microsusgical ( MICRO ) successfully employ procedure apparently result improve result , however , previous control clinical study evaluate MICRO SLCRF comparison SLCRF perform originally describe ( MACRO ) . The objective present study compare clinical outcome MICRO MACRO SLCRF treatment human GR . METHODS : Fourteen patient , bilateral Miller class I GR defect randomly assign MICRO MACRO SLCRF . Clinical parameter , assess baseline 6 month later , include recession height ( RECH ) , recession width ( RECW ) , width keratinize tissue ( WKT ) , probe depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , pain measurement esthetic evaluation Root Coverage Score ( RCS ) . Inter-measurements difference analyze Chi-square paired t-test , significance set α &lt; 0.05 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Population Experimental Design The study design randomize , prospective , split-mouth , control clinical trial . It conduct accordance guideline Helsinki Declaration 1975 , revise 2000 , approve institutional review board approval ( CEP CMM/HUAP 162/2010 ) . Written inform consent obtain patient thorough explanation nature , risk , benefit clinical investigation associate procedure . The study population consist patient referred periodontal treatment School Dentistry , Veiga de Almeida University , Brazil . In order elegible present study , adult individual meet follow inclusion criterion : 1. presence bilateral Miller class I gingival recession ( ≤ 3mm ) 2. least 2mm keratinized tissue width ( WKT ) 3. endodontically-vital 4. maxillary canine premolar . 5. shallow ( &lt; 3mm ) probe depth ( PD ) 6. bleed probe . 7. absence contraindication periodontal surgery 8. medication know interfere periodontal tissue health heal 9. teeth treat free caries restoration Exclusion criterion : 1. presence untreated periodontal disease 2. smoker 3. subject immunosuppressive systemic disease ( i.e. , cancer , AIDS , diabetes ) 4 . Miller class II , III class IV recession defect , 5. presence apical radiolucency caries restoration area treat , 6. previous lack cooperation maintenance program Fourteen patient ( 8 female 6 male ) , 25 41 year age ( mean age , 31.6 year ) , include study January 2010 December 2010 . The primary outcome variable study reduction recession depth . Sample size determine Power analysis , assume α .05 , standard deviation 0.7 . This calculation indicate sample 14 subject , study would &gt; 95 % power detect 1-mm difference recession depth two group . All patient subject initial periodontal therapy 28 day begin study . Treatment include oral hygiene instruction , scale root planning need , tooth polishing , plaque control measure correction traumatic tooth brushing technique . All patient instruct trained use soft toothbrush eliminate habit relate etiology recession . Baseline full mouth plaque bleed score low . Each defect randomly assign one two treatment modality employ : ( ) Controls ( n=14 ) : semilunar coronally reposition flap perform without aid visual magnification ( MACRO ) ; ( b ) Test ( n=14 ) : SLCRF perform magnification surgical microscope ( MACRO ) toss coin immediately surgical procedure , perform clinical appointment . Single recession defect 6 canine , 14 first-premolars , 8 second-premolars treat . Patients informed site allocation surgical procedure . Clinical data collection Clinical parameter assess measurement record blind , train calibrated examiner ( ATD ) , unaware treatment provide , baseline 6 month later . Visual plaque score ( VPS ) bleed probe ( BOP ) assess dichotomously mid-buccal location . Recession height ( RECH ) measure distance CEJ GM . Recession width ( RECW ) measure distance lateral border recession level CEJ . The width keratinize tissue ( WKT ) measure distance GM MGJ . Thickness gingival tissue ( GT ) measure 2mm apically GM . PD measure distance GM bottom gingival sulcus . PD RECH use calculate clinical attachment level ( CAL ) . Measurements PD CAL perform use UNC # 15 periodontal probe . Measurements RECH , RECW , WKT GT perform endodontic spreader rubber stopper ( Maillefer , Dentsply , Brasil ) , data acquire digital gauge 0.01mm resolution ( Mitutoyo South America , Susano , Brazil ) . Aesthetic patient-related evaluation Esthetic outcomes evaluated Root Coverage Score ( RCS ) ( Cairo et al 2009 ) six month surgical procedure . Root coverage ( RC ) score zero root coverage obtain ( RECH 6 month equal RECH obtain baseline ) , three partial ( RECH &gt; 0 ) six complete root coverage ( RECH=0 ) . Other variable ( gingival contour , tissue texture , mucogingival junction alignment gingival color ) compare contra-lateral side score one point ( zero point significantly different contra-lateral side ) . Thus , evaluation scale compose five independent parameter result total score 10 . One important patient-related evaluation post-surgical pain experience . In order quantify frequence severity pain , visual analog scale ( VAS ) pain employed seven day surgical procedure , zero mean complete absence pain ten maximum tolerable pain patient . Prevalence pain document dichotomously pain VAS score equal zero pain VAS score big zero . Severity pain quantified direct value obtain VAS score . Surgical Procedures perform one operator ( SK ) involve clinical data measurement , patient allocation . Before surgery , patient give single dose 8mg dexamethasone ( EMS , São Paulo , Brasil ) reduce post-surgical edema . Intraoral antisepsis perform 0.12 % chlorhexidine rinse ( Lacer , Barcelona , Spain ) . Anesthesia obtain regional block 2.0 % Mepivacaine 1:1 00.000 epinephrine ( DFL , Rio de Janeiro , Brasil ) . Semilunar coronally position flap - Conventional approach The MACRO SLCRF procedure perform originally describe Tarnow et al ( 1986 ) . Briefly , semilunar incision ( SLI ) carry follow outline gingival margin 15c surgical blade . This incision end papilla interproximal area tooth treat , way tip papilla . At least 2mm gingiva preserve side flap order preserve blood supply . The SLI curve apically extent guarantee apical part flap rest bone coronal advancement cover root . In order transgingival probe perform incision determine position bone crest . An intrasulcular incision ( ISI ) perform mid-facially . Then , split-thickness ( ST ) dissection perform initial incision coronally connect ISI . The mid-facial tissue completely release , position coronally CEJ hold place tooth moist gauze pad place light pressure , perpendicular flap , five minute . No suture place , however , cyanoacrilate adhesive ( CAA ) apply post-surgical gingival margin tooth enamel stabilize flap . Semilunar coronally position flap - Microsurgical approach The MICRO SLCRF procedure perform described Bittencourt et al ( 2006 , 2009 ) . Briefly , employ surgical microscope ( DF Vanconcelos , model MC M1232 ) , SLI carry follow outline gingival margin # 6961 microsurgical blade ( Surgistar , California , EUA ) ( 8x ) magnification , ST dissection , flap advancement stabilization perform descrided . Statistical Analysis All descriptive statistic express mean +/- standard deviation ( SD ) . Baseline measurement subject inter-group comparison , analyze non-parametric Wilcoxon test Chi-square test . Inter-group intra-group comparison baseline six-month measurement analyze Wilcoxon test Chi-square test . Wilcoxon 's signed rank test use intra-group comparison Wilcoxon 's rank sum test use inter-group comparison . Statistical significance set 95 % probability level ( P &lt; 0.05 ) .</detailed_description>
