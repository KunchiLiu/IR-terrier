	<brief_summary>Patients undergo surgery often receive paralytic agent ( neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBAs ) ) facilitate procedure . At end surgery , effect NMBAs reverse drug call neostigmine . The use neostigmine significantly reduce risk patient leave muscle weakness recovery room . Many anesthesiologist routinely use neostigmine postoperative muscle weakness may lead adverse event surgery . Other anesthesiologist routinely administer neostigmine operating room concern potential side effect . Surprisingly , investigator report neostigmine-induced muscle weakness may occur drug give effect NMBAs completely wear . In contrast , investigator observe side effect neostigmine give end surgery . The aim study determine whether neostigmine use associate muscle weakness give time nearly complete recovery NMBAs . Muscle strength measure use sensitive monitor ( TOF-Watch-SX ) examination patient evidence muscle weakness . Patients also evaluate recover anesthesia surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neostigmine Reversal And Neuromuscular Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>120 patient enrol randomized clinical trial . Patients assign , via computer-generated randomized table , either neostigmine group neostigmine group . Patients neostigmine group receive neostigmine 40 µg/kg end surgical procedure TOF ratio recover 0.9 great . Patients neostigmine group administer saline ( control ) time neuromuscular recovery . Patients TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 exclude either study cohort . These subject administer neostigmine 50 µg/kg conclusion surgery . The postoperative data ( see ) record group collect two study cohort order determine characteristic patient achieve spontaneous recovery . Anesthetic care standardize study group . Patients induced propofol 1-2 mg/kg , fentanyl 100 µg/kg , rocuronium NMBA ( 1 X ed 95 dose ) . No rocuronium administer unless request surgeon . Clinicians instructed manage neuromuscular blockade full recovery muscle strength present end surgical procedure . Neuromuscular blockade operating room quantify TOF-Watch-SX , FDA-approved quantitative monitoring device . After induction anesthesia , baseline data collect . A 5-second 50 Hz tetanic stimulation apply reduce time require achieve baseline signal stabilization . After signal stability achieve , TOF-Watch calibrate baseline TOF value record . Rocuronium administer oral endotracheal tube place 2-4 minute later . Neuromuscular blockade manage allow spontaneous recovery neuromuscular function occur , goal reach TOF ratio ≥ 0.9 end surgical procedure . At time neostigmine typically administer , one two syrinx attach intravenous line , clear solution ( neostigmine saline ) give . These syrinx prepare prior end surgery . For patient neostigmine group , 40 µg/kg neostigmine ( appropriate dose glycopyrrolate ) drawn syringe label accordingly . For patient neostigmine group , equal volume saline drawn syringe , neostigmine label apply syringe . Both neostigmine saline solution clear indistinguishable ( prepared pharmacy ) . Thereafter , data collection obtain research assistant blind group assignment . Immediately prior neostigmine saline administration , TOF ratio record , syringe attach intravenous line solution inject . Train-of-four ratio record every 12 second time tracheal extubation . During transport operate room PACU , research assistant observe oxygen saturation level , low value record . Oxygenation pulse oximeter also monitor record first 30 minute PACU admission ( every 1 minute via PACU monitor system ) . The need addition oxygen therapy time follow extubation note . During time period ( extubation 30 minute PACU arrival ) patient carefully observe evidence airway obstruction need maneuver maintain patent airway . This data record research assistant PACU nursing staff . In addition , 15 minute PACU admission , subject examine 11 sign 16 symptom muscle weakness . This examination perform blind research assistant . The time require achieve discharge criterion actual PACU discharge record .</detailed_description>
