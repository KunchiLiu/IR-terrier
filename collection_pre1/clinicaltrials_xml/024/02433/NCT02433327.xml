	<detailed_description>Introduction Evolving critical illness patient death potentially predict prevent . Observation study indicate deterioration clinical condition hospitalise patient often precede physiological change 24 hour death . Focus adult patient number year development risk score system , also call `` Early Warning Score '' ( EWS ) systematically measure patient vital status . International experience show systematic observation EWS accompany action algorithm contribute prevent cardiac arrest , death transfer intensive care . In many area child different adult ; e.g . physiological anatomical difference EWS system develop adult thus use child . Challenges assess child critically ill relate child 's symptom serious illness often uncharacteristic . Children seem relatively unaffected short time circulatory insufficiency cardiac arrest . Thus , need develop investigate EWS model ill child significant influence child 's development acute condition . Background In Denmark , 100,000 child age 15 year admit annually . International study show 8.5 - 14.0 % cardiac arrest incidence intensive care unit involve paediatric patient . Survival 15 - 33 % subsequent significant neurological outcome 35 % survive child . The intention EWS system admit patient ensure staff identifies deterioration patient 's condition time . Each value release `` score '' total score determines treatment initiate . International study adult patient show 24 hour prior development cardiac arrest life-threatening situation show sign acute critical illness . There national international model EWS adult . Despite several international report show lack identification proper action patient develop acute critical illness remain problem . A study 126 death among English child show 89 death occur hospital ; among estimate 63 ( 71 % ) could avoid . Lack acknowledge severity disease emphasise decisive factor together absence measure interpret physical sign correctly . It paramount timely care treatment child work systematically assess child 's symptoms severity symptom . The quality acute treatment come focus report Danish Health Medicines Authority . Several paediatric department establish simulation train care treatment acute critically ill child optimise competence ensure adequate response healthcare staff . Structured initial assessment acutely admit child - paediatric triage model - comprise systematic assessment severity child 's symptom within first minute . The implemented triage model determines order intervention . More hospital establish so-called Rapid Response Teams ( RRT ) , kind acute team facilitate early intervention ward patient develops life-threatening situation cardiac arrest . The criterion call RRT central factor prevention acute life-threatening situation cardiac arrest early notification RRT improve patient outcome . This project shift focus response life-threatening situation cardiac arrest early warning critical illness . Improvement patient safety focus area Denmark ; show initiative Danish Safer Hospital Programme aim reduced mortality patient harm well Danish Quality Model aim improve quality health service , reduce harm create well patient pathway . Development standard systematic observation patient national clinical guideline early warning critical illness adult patient specific initiatives national level Children different adult Care treatment critically ill child challenge child 's symptom critical illness uncharacteristic . A critically ill child sepsis severely dehydration seem relatively unaffected acute condition identify affected vital parameter . Children 's mechanism compensate well adult child able maintain almost normal blood pressure despite considerable loss fluid . On hand , child turn critically ill fast limit child 's ability compensate exceed . Thus , important acknowledge act often subtle sign acute critical illness child prognosis survival poor child develop cardiac arrest . Experiences EWS adult show system stand alone see interaction several factor . In protocol Paediatric Early Warning Score ( PEWS ) one several intervention include : - Education training staff - Standardised monitoring - Interprofessional guideline - Algorithms action intervention critically ill child . When health professional systematically observe , interpret act adequately change child 's condition , serious consequence hospitalise child . A Canadian developed PEWS model one study model large study . The model develop , test subsequently modify consist seven different parameter . The model include measurement blood pressure , specific challenge paediatric population . Often child upset blood pressure measure , cause pressure increase ; increase necessarily sign clinical exacerbation disease . At time , blood pressure late finding connection evolve critical illness due child 's ability compensate ; could argument measure blood pressure hospitalise child . Moreover , model include assessment level consciousness child ; investigator believe important factor assess critical illness evolve child . The investigator wish compare Canadian model investigator `` local '' model , include assessment level consciousness measure blood pressure . Measuring blood pressure `` local '' model perform extra examination child high score i.e . child risk evolve critical illness . Measurement blood pressure thus use screen hospitalised child Canadian model . Apart , two PEWS model similar ; underlying action algorithm , age category cut value vital sign similar . In PEWS review , conclude considerable variation purpose , content threshold action well lack evidence validity , reliability applicability publish PEWS model . Reliability investigate one study study report experience health professional concern applicability PEWS . In study PEWS Great Britain , large variation use parameter ; 46 different parameter use hospital use PEWS model validate thoroughly investigate . This also apply EWSs adult Cochrane review , also draw attention lack randomise control study ( RCT ) study investigate applicability clinical relevance accord clinical staff . There thus need demand RCT design study PEWS also study reliability clinical staff ' perception applicability . This study investigate core issue use RCT design , yet conduct paediatric population . Purpose The purpose study investigate PEWS hospitalise child optimise identification acute critically ill child prevent life-threatening situation thus reduce number unplanned admission intensive care , cardiac arrest death . Moreover , study investigate validation clinical applicability PEWS well acceptability tool among healthcare professional . Design Multi-center randomise control intervention study within Complex Intervention framework ; study shed light problem , validation data collection instrument , test intervention evaluation . Randomisation The department access web-based randomisation programme , `` Trialpartner '' . Each patient get number randomisation . If patient readmitted inclusion period obtain result initial randomisation . Sample size statistical analysis Data analyse intention treat principle . Number acute critical condition lead consultation neonatal specialist anaesthesiologist unplanned transfer intensive care register . Focus child 's condition last 24 hour document acute critical life-threatening condition ( well observation level action relation acute critical condition unplanned transfer intensive care ) . As PEWS must able identify child risk acute life-threatening condition time `` window '' intervention , data analysis stop one hour prior occurrence acute life-threatening condition avoid overestimate effect PEWS . Background variable : child 's age , gender , discharge diagnosis , length hospitalisation , triage level admission , vital sign , respiratory status , temperature , level consciousness , observation level , initiated intervention , time observation deteriorate condition adequate intervention . This information collect patient record . Currently , power calculation make base accessible data 2011 . With power 80 % expect reduction number transfer intensive care 30 % , 4,000 child must include group ; total study population 26,800 child annually . An interim analysis plan half-way study . The study interrupt significant difference two model concern select effect parameter . Ethical consideration The intervention directly affect hospitalise child measurement pulse saturation . Measurements non-invasive cause pain discomfort standard procedure acutely hospitalise child . It thus expect cause discomfort give rise concern child parent . It important patient ` experience anxiety , concern irritation address dealt . It therefore great importance ward nursing staff think communicate inform patient perform measure vital parameter nurse staff professional informative way argue measure important . Several study show bedside observation vital parameter simple algorithm base bedside observation identify patient risk deteriorate . In ethical perspective therefore unethical react finding implement new ward practice .</detailed_description>
