	<brief_summary>The diagnosis CF currently base discovery two CFTR gene mutation / positive sweat test ( &gt; 60mmol / l ) . A significant number patient atypical cystic fibrosis ( chronic sino-pulmonary disease single mutation CFTR gene / test intermediate sweat 30 60 mmol / l ) undetected technique behind specialized care irreversible lung damage already exist . Currently , measurement nasal potential difference vivo ( DPN ) , evaluate transportation chlorine nasal epithelium electrode , propose diagnosis atypical form . However DPN dependent nasal local condition analyse always offer possibility conclude diagnosis cystic fibrosis . It necessary develop new reliable diagnostic test detection case atypical cystic fibrosis . The author propose develop new diagnostic technique base study bioelectric property preparation nasal cell subject obtain brushing place primary culture ( CCBN ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autosomal recessive , CF cause mutation CFTR gene whose nature determine clinical expression severity disease affect mainly respiratory , digestive genital . Respiratory pathology mainly responsible morbidity mortality patient cystic fibrosis . CFTR , ion channel carry chlorine , play essential role respiratory disease involvement change surface liquid cover respiratory epithelial cell . Currently measurement nasal potential difference vivo ( DPN ) cause argument electrophysiological diagnosis cystic fibrosis ( chlorine transport default ) patient atypical form render difficult non-interpretable lack cooperation patient ( especially child support presence probe nose ) mostly due poor local condition relate infectious disease rhino sinus patient . It necessary develop new reliable diagnostic test detection case atypical cystic fibrosis . The study ion transport nasal epithelial cell collect brushing ( NBC ) diagnosis atypical form cystic fibrosis test trial new diagnostic test . This research focus three group : 1 . Of patient cystic fibrosis adult . 2. adult patient atypical form 3. people cystic fibrosis Depending patient group , one CCBN CCBN DPN CCBN DPN genetic analysis verify absence mutation .</detailed_description>
