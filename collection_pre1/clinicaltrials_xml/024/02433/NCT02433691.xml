	<brief_summary>This pilot study first step rapidly grow area clinical research create effective mean combat age-related loss cognitive function preventive lifestyle strategy physical exercise memory training . This study develop innovative simultaneous exercise memory training program non-demented volunteer subjective memory complaint ( control MCI ) . Our primary goal ass cognitive impact 4-week memory training program do twice weekly : 1. simultaneous aerobic exercise ( SIM-AR-MET ) , 2. sequentially aerobic exercise ( SEQ-AR-MET ) , 3. without aerobic exercise ( replace sequential stretch tone ) ( SEQ-ST-MET ) . The investigator also measure potential metabolic ( e.g. , glucose , lipid panel ) molecular ( serum BDNF ) mediator observe cognitive change subset participant ( UCLA CTRC/IPCN site ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Memory Exercise Training Study Older Adults With Subjective Memory Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 90 non-demented healthy old adult volunteer ( age 60-75 ) subjective memory complaint ( control MCI ) screen enrol study . The CTRC/IPCN site enroll 30 subject ( 10 group ) ; MPTF site enroll 60 subject ( 20 group ) . Baseline assessment include neuropsychological test study subject . At UCLA CTRC/IPCN , baseline assessment also include cardiorespiratory fitness , body composition , YMCA fitness test , blood-based marker metabolism plasticity . To control total activity level , study subject wear continuous physical activity monitor ( FitBit accelerometer ) keep exercise cognitive activity log entire study . All subject ( n = 90 ) first complete 1-week observational period capture baseline activity level . Subjects randomize one three group : SIM-AR-E &amp; MT , SEQ-AR-E &amp; MT , SEQ-ST-MET ( n = 30 per group ) . SIM-AR-MET SEQ-AR-MET subject complete 3-week exercise 'ramp-up ' period consist twice weekly 1-hour session practice stationary bicycling , improve cardiovascular fitness enough complete upcoming 4-weeks MET session ( describe ) , practice stretch tone ; SEQ-ST-MET subject 3-week exercise 'ramp-up ' period consist equal number six stretch tone session ( aerobic component ) . All 3 program two 2-hour session per week 4 week . The SIM-AR-MET SEQ-ST-MET subject stretching/toning first hour ; SEQ-AR-MET subject aerobic cycle first hour . During second half session , 3 group first learn new memory training strategy sedentary . SIM-AR-MET subject practice memory technique cycle SEQ-AR-MET SEQ-ST-MET subject practice memory technique still sedentary . The three group group specific exercise memory training homework assignment , along monitoring activity log cognitively enrich activity . The NP test do end 4 week memory training class study subject . UCLA CTRC/IPCN subject additional test do baseline ( e.g. , blood-based marker , etc. ) . Consideration give purely observational 'wait-list ' group , experience population group typically initiate great level self-guided exercise memory training reaction put wait list . Alternatively , increase activity memory training undertaken wait list subject , investigator would expect difference cognitive performance measurable within brief 3 month total time frame initial study . The investigator also consider group aerobic exercise immediately memory training , base current literature , combination seem least likely impact memory synergistically . Thus , two group defer pilot later , large study do confirm refute hypothesis . Similarly , primary aim assess change NP performance test subject , pilot nature study prohibit test secondary aim site . The academic medical center site leverage assistance UCLA CTRC/IPCN accomplish preliminary test secondary aim 30 subject , UCLA MPTF community site test primary study aim change NP performance .</detailed_description>
