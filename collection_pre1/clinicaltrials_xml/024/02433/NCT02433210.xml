	<brief_summary>The aim study confirm safety clinical effectiveness Nipro ELISIO-15H compare performance characteristic hemocompatibility commercially available dialyzer U.S.A. , Gambro Polyflux Revaclear Fresenius F160NRe . 10 stable patient dialyze 3 times/week dialyzer 3 week . Blood sample several parameter collect hemodialysis ass performance hemocompatibility dialyzer study . Data thus collect analyzed comparison standard statistical analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Comparing Basic Performance Hemocompatibility 3 Different Dialyzers Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current patient receive dialysis treatment end stage renal disease meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enter study . These patient continue standard dialysis regimen state clinic Standard Operating Procedures . Each patient study three week week start dialyzer different manufacture comparable characteristic . Solute clearance removal determine three dialysis session week . During session 2 week additional specimen take analyze hemocompatibility . At end study clearance hemocompatibility marker dialyzer compare one another well manufacture state characteristic . Blood clearance removal calculation take time 0 , 60 minute 240 minute . Blood hemocompatibility determination take time 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 240 minute . Flow rate , anticoagulant therapy , erythropoietin therapy , venous arterial pressure also record .</detailed_description>
