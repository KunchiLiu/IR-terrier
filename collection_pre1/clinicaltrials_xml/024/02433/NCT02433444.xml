	<brief_summary>In study , investigator aim distinguish patient Post-Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) Pancreatitis ( PEP ) vs. without PEP base difference pre- vs. post-ERCP measurement AGIS-derived intestinal rate ( IR ) . Based clinical observation many patient PEP develop ileus follow ERCP , investigator hypothesize patient develop PEP exhibit lower IR follow ERCP , therefore large difference pre- vs. post-ERCP IR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective case series 100 patient present Cedars Sinai Medical Center undergo Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . The investigator place AGIS sensor patient enrol study , 30 minute prior procedure . The investigator continuously record AGIS acoustic signal T-30 minute time leave hospital , either discharge Post-Anesthesia Care Unit discharge hospitalization , option discontinue clinically require request provider patient . Acoustic signal evaluate , intestinal motility event calculate ; however , data use make decision regard clinical care . Physicians nurse make aware AbStats readings.These measurement solely observational . Patients manage accord standard-of-care practice . Routinely , patient keep post-operative unit procedure , one hour . Those pain examine physician decision make admit observation monitor complication ERCP , discharge home . The patient discharge home procedure follow telephone survey every day 2 day post procedure determine develop symptom suggestive PEP . If , ask go close urgent care emergency department evaluation . Those admitted observation post procedure follow sign symptom PEP include meeting 2 3 criterion : Abdominal pain , amylase/lipase &gt; 3 time upper limit normal 24 hour procedure , and/or image consistent pancreatitis . The AGIS multi-sensor wireless abdominal monitoring system include low profile acoustic sensor apply anterior abdominal wall Tegaderm monitor sound emanate GI tract . The acoustic sensor continuously non-invasively monitor capture audio signal represent GI abdominal wall function . The captured data record synchronized manner two sensor , place 3cm either side umbilicus . After patient 's participation study complete , investigator analyze AbStats reading clinical outcome observe correlation exist patient low intestinal rate develop PEP .</detailed_description>
