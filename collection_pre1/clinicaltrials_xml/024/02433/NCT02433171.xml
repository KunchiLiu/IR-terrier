	<brief_summary>The goal protocol evaluate potential PET image amino acid transport microglial activation improve differentiation tumor recurrence radiation necrosis patient brain metastasis treatment stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) re-growing lesion . These state-of-the-art imaging tool use combination standard magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) FDG-PET ( fluorodeoxyglucose ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize use two different PET tracer , one sensitive tumor metabolic activity , one sensitive inflammatory process , investigator separately identify metabolically active tumor radiation necrosis relate inflammation . This accomplished quantitative assessment tracer uptake use kinetic modeling technique , well high-resolution image assess distribution tracer uptake tumor region . All participant study receive diagnostic test .</detailed_description>
