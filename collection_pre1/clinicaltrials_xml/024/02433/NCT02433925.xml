	<brief_summary>Inflammation oxidative stress common finding patient Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) undergo conservative treatment , addition associate atherosclerotic process , relate also progression CKD . In regard , resveratrol , phenolic compound recognize antioxidant anti-inflammatory property , play important role control metabolic disorder associate CKD , since modulate mechanism involve inflammation oxidative stress cycle . Resveratrol capable promote activation transcription-related factor-2 nuclear factor erythroid factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) , nuclear factor anti-inflammatory property , SIRT-1 , protein also associate reduction inflammation . These two factor , turn , able inhibit / antagonize activity nuclear factor ÎºB ( NF-kB ) , transcription factor participate inflammatory response . Although promising treatment , study evaluate effect resveratrol supplementation patient CKD . Thus , study aim evaluate effect resveratrol supplementation inflammation oxidative stress patient undergo conservative treatment CKD .</brief_summary>
