Another study , preliminary result small VC/VS Gamma capsulotomy lesion suggest procedure safe remain efficacious . Our aim investigate efficacy safety profile small , single-shot VC/VS Gamma capsulotomy OCD . This study support development future double-blind , randomize clinical trial single-shot VC/VS Gamma capsulotomy .</brief_summary>
