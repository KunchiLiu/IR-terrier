	<detailed_description>Advances surgical clinical management patient congenital heart disease make survival adulthood expectation . Today 1 million adult survivor congenital heart disease , increase age bring additional concern patient population . Although literature remain scarce , exist evidence suggest inactivity , obesity , diabetes , cancer , acquire cardiovascular disease may least prevalent patient congenital heart disease , , age-matched general population . Acquired cardiovascular disease likely impact substantially long-term survival quality life patient palliate already fragile heart . This research study determine risk factor acquire heart disease , adult congenital heart disease . This knowledge important develop target way prevent delay onset acquire heart disease adult congenital heart disease .</detailed_description>
