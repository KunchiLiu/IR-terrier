	<detailed_description>This registry collect data prospectively patient paroxysmal , persistent longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation ( hereafter `` AF '' ) undergo Phased RFA treatment . Phased RFA apply accord 'Intended Use ' CE mark release product packaging . The treatment perform accord routine hospital practice additional test require specific registry . This registry serve tool collect clinical data order expand knowledge base safety , effectiveness functionality Medtronic Phased RFA System real world patient population . The key measure collect patient inclusive , limited , clinical data pertain AF individual disease state ( ) characterize form AF underline disease , Phased RFA procedure detail include time catheter use , procedure system related adverse event , AF recurrence , re-ablations leave atrial flutter rate index Phased RFA procedure . Additionally , study provide information evolve anticoagulation strategy ( e.g . continuous versus bridge vitamin K antagonist versus novel oral anticoagulant ) set AF ablation . Patients follow minimum 12 month maximum 14 month Phased RFA ablation procedure . The twelve month follow-up do telephone standard care hospital 's practice . During twelve month follow-up patient interview quality life questionnaire result compare quality life questionaire complete procedure .</detailed_description>
