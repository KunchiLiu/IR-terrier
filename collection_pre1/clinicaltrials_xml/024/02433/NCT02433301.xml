	<brief_summary>The incidence malignity gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) rise Denmark , 400 new case annually 1 . 60 % patient GEJ cancer disseminate disease ( M1-stage ) time diagnosis consequently unable undergo curative intend surgery . The prognosis poor , 5-year survival rate approximately 2 % 60 % treatment consist palliative therapy 1 . For remain approximately 40 % assessed candidate curative intend surgery , 5-year survival rate 33 % 1 . This emphasize need research knowledge concern tumour biology spontaneous course disease . In Denmark , cancer patient enrol specific cancer program . The primary diagnostic work-up GEJ cancer include gastroscopy biopsy , blood sample , ultrasonography scan , Positronemissionstomography ( PET ) Computed tomography ( CT ) alone PET/CT combination 2 . From parameter physician determine resectability TNM-stage ( tumour stag ) , substantial prognosis future treatment . The primary goal achieve macroscopically resection tumour lymphnodes relation stomach oesophagus ( Esophagectomi a.m. Ivor Lewis D1+ lymphadenectomy abdomen thorax ) . In addition surgery , patient receive perioperative chemotherapy , consist three series chemotherapy preoperative three series postoperative approximately 21-28 day surgery . Approximately 12.6 % patient receive perioperative chemotherapy prior surgery disease progression due chemotherapy resistance therapy 3 . This unintentionally lead shift patient resectable group non-resectable group ( palliative treatment ) . Thus , possibility detect response perioperative chemotherapy great interest . A paradigm shift towards individualise tailored therapy form emerge recent year , potentially require high need diagnosis molecular level . Today molecular biological method apply tissue sample in-vitro analysis , new radiological tool provide opportunity non-invasive examination ; example PET radioactive sugar compound : Flour-18 deoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) . This compound inject catheter large vein ( medium cubiti vein ) absorb cell increase metabolism - especially cancer cell . A PET scanner register absorption ; radiology modality provide valid information , essential non-invasive tumour stag monitoring response specific therapy . A new diagnostic modality PET scan combinated magnetic resonance ( PET/MR ) simultaneously . So far , study conduct evaluation simultaneous PET/MR scan ass perioperative chemotherapy response patient GEJ cancer . However , study suggest commercially available PET/MR scanner might contribute diagnostic elucidation 6 . Simultaneous PET/MR scan might theory minimize misinterpretation potential response change chemotherapy , appear interval separate PET , CT MR scan 4,5,7 . Studies find PET scan GEJ cancer could helpful prognostic tool differentiate responder non-responders chemotherapy 9 . Standardized uptake value ( SUV ) unit display absorption 18F-FDG use routinely quantify tumour glucose metabolism PET scan 8 . A change 35 % SUV measurement induction chemotherapy consider definition responder non-responders early study 9 . The MR technique base magnetic field radio wave . Diffusion Weighted Imaging ( DWI ) non-invasive MR-modality , measure change water diffusion ( Brownian movement ) throughout tissue . These change measure Apparent Diffusion Coefficient ( ADC ) , parameter derive DWI reflect change diffusion 7 . ADC DWI use differentiate benign malignant tumour , due large cell density malignant tumour . Consequently , malignant tissue decrease diffusion relative normal tissue . ADC use factor study predict response chemotherapy 10 . A single study show rise ADC-value two week initiation chemotherapy patient GEJ cancer , demonstrate percentage change ADC-value group ( responder non-responders ) significantly different 11 . Simultaneous PET- MR scan might useful evaluate response chemotherapy patient GEJ cancer compare parameter alone . The opportunity individualise tailor treatment future might possible PET/MR .</brief_summary>
