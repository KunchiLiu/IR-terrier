	<brief_summary>The key aim Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Cohort-Study ( SMSC ) 1 . To maintain long-term cohort ( &gt; 10 year ) representative MS population currently live Switzerland . This require effective measure limit drop-outs continuous recruitment MS patient 2 . To conduct systematic follow-up standardize , high quality collection clinical magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data , well body fluid . The significant heterogeneity within diagnostic entity phenotype multiple sclerosis ( MS ) incompletely understood . A central necessary prerequisite advance sufficient amount high quality clinical paraclinical ( image , body fluid ) patient data . Nested project address specific research topic , facilitate collaboration qualify investigator within group SMSC investigator . The nested project focus : 1 . Development validation diagnostic prognostic marker spontaneous disease evolution therapeutic response . 2 . Exploration safety impact long-term disability exist next generation MS treatments 3 . Individualized therapy : A number highly active potentially also harmful therapy lately establish treatment MS. To date , due lack individual prognostic marker patient may receive aggressive therapy due safety concern , patient benign disease may receive expensive potentially harmful treatment without need .</brief_summary>
