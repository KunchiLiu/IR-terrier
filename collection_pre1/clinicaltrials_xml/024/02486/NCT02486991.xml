	<detailed_description>Thirty patient treat : 15 coronally position tunnel technique plus intramucosal vertical AlloDerm® ( test treatment ) 15 coronally position tunnel technique alone AlloDerm® ( control treatment ) . The surgical procedure control sit consist coronally position tunnel preparation modification previous tunnel technique describe Allen AL ( Allen AL , 1994a/1994b ) . This tunnel technique modify include coronal positioning soft tissue allograft ( E.P Allen ) . The surgical procedure test site consist coronally position tunnel preparation ( E.P . Allen ) plus use mesial and/or distal intramucosal vertical , modification vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access ( VISTA ) approach ( Zadeh H , 2011 ) . In test control group , AlloDerm® suture use continuous sling suture technique Maxon 5-0 , 3/8 circle 13 mm needle tissue coronally position suture separately use continuous sling suture technique ( line angle line angle ) PTFE 4-0 , 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle . In test group , intramucosal vertical incision suture use simple interrupted suture PTFE 4-0 , 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle . Each patient provide least one Miller Class I II facial recession defect , ≥ 3 mm . Each patient initially receive full diagnostic work-up include periapical bite-wing radiograph select site adjacent teeth , study cast , intra-oral photograph , full mouth clinical examination . Pre-surgical preparation include detailed oral hygiene instruction , scale root plan local anesthesia , occlusal adjustment indicate . Baseline data test adjacent teeth record day surgical treatment include : Miller 's classification recession defect , Plaque Index , Gingival Index , Bleeding Probing Index , Gingival Margin Levels ( Recession ) , Keratinized Tissue , Clinical Attachment Level , Clinical Tooth Mobility , Creeping Attachment , Tooth Vitality , Radiographic Examination , Patient Models , Clinical photo . Patients randomly select coin toss receive either test control treatment . Mentor toss coin immediately prior begin surgical procedure . Patients evaluate postoperatively period 4 month . The examiner blind aware patient treatment time term study . Three exam measurement perform per patient total : preoperative , week eight 16 ( 4 month ) postoperatively . The primary aim compare percent root coverage obtain acellular dermal matrix use coronally position tunnel technique alone intramucosal vertical . Means standard deviation calculate parameter . Statistical significance mean residual recession data parameter analyze use pair t-test detect within group statistical difference unpaired t-test detect group statistical difference . The sample size 15 per group afford 80 % statistical power detect difference 1.0 mm coverage group . Sample size power calculation base data previous study . All surgical procedure complete one operator direction one mentor . First , presurgical measurement take . Defect width measure horizontally interproximal osseous crest level 1.0 mm coronal defect base . Probing depth , width keratinize tissue , gingival margin level also measure . Next , treatment modality determine assigned defect . Local anesthesia administer , tissue elevate , measurement level alveolar crest make directly reference CEJ . The alveolar crest measure vertically mid-buccal , great point defect , proximal osseous crest level . The soft tissue recession defect measure horizontally vertically osseous measurement . Root surface meticulously root plan use hand instrument obtain smooth , hard root surface , incision make . No osseous recontouring perform . The surgical procedure control sit consist coronally position tunnel preparation modification previous tunnel technique describe Allen AL ( Allen AL , 1994a/1994b ) . This tunnel technique modify include coronal positioning soft tissue allograft ( E.P Allen ) . Split-thickness dissection beyond mucogingival junction make elevate tissue allow adequate coronal positioning . The tunnel dissect use specialized microsurgical kit . The tunnel ADM extend least one tooth mesial distal recession site . Papillae completely elevate osseous crest whole tissue complex mobile coronally position . In case access difficult , incision make release papilla prevent tear tissue . The surgical procedure test site consist coronally position tunnel preparation ( E.P . Allen ) plus use mesial and/or distal intramucosal vertical , modification vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access ( VISTA ) approach ( Zadeh H , 2011 ) . The procedure begin one multiple ( mesial distal ) intramucosal vertical incision , location access depend site treat . The intramucosal incision make periosteum elevate subperiosteal tunnel , expose facial osseous plate well root dehiscence . The tunnel ADM extend least one tooth mesial distal recession site . The tunnel dissect use specialized microsurgical kit . It crucial extend tunnel elevation sufficiently beyond mucogingival margin well gingival sulcus teeth augment allow low-tension coronal repositioning gingiva . The tunnel extend interproximally papilla far embrasure space permit , without make surface incision papillae . For control test group , Alloderm® hydrate two bath : first sterile saline minimum five minute back separate Alloderm® , second sterile saline plus tetracycline ratio 5 mg tetracycline / 1 mL saline tissue fully hydrate . Next , AlloDerm® adjust completely cover defect , position root surface , CEJ , inferior lateral border graft extend least 3.0 mm beyond osseous defect margin . In control group , AlloDerm® suture use continuous sling suture technique Maxon 5-0 , 3/8 circle 13 mm needle tissue coronally position suture separately use continuous sling suture technique ( line angle line angle ) PTFE 4-0 , 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle . In test group , AlloDerm® suture use continuous sling suture technique Maxon 5-0 , 3/8 circle 13 mm needle tissue coronally position suture separately use continuous sling suture technique ( line angle line angle ) PTFE 4-0 , 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle . The intramucosal vertical incision suture use simple interrupted suture PTFE 4-0 , 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle . Post-operative instruction give patient along prescription , appropriate case , systemic doxycycline hyclate 100 mg day 14 day ; anti-inflammatory agent ( naproxen 375 mg q12h 7 day ) ; analgesic ( Vicodin ES q6-8h prn pain ) ; steroid , Medrol dose pack , 21 tablet 4 mg methylprednisolone ; 6 tablet day 1 , 5 day 2 , decrease 1/day last tablet dose day 6 , dexamethazone 1mg , 18 tablet , 3 tablets/day 1st 3 day , 2/day next 3 day , 1/day last 3 day ( always take morning ) .
