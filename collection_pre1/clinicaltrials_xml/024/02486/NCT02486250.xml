	<detailed_description>This three year study conduct cooperation Brain Health Registry ( BHR , CHR # 12-09628 ) , internet-based registry enroll individual order facilitate clinical trial prevention Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) brain diseases disorder . The investigator goal validate Brain Health Registry 's online cognitive measure develop Lumosity . Investigators meet goal collect data newly develop BHR online cognitive screening battery along standardized measure memory , attention , executive function speed information processing currently use clinical trial Alzheimer 's disease . Investigators enroll 1000 subject , 500 recruit upon register BHR . The 500 subject recruited Memory Aging Center University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) Center Imaging Neurodegenerative Diseases ( CIND ) San Francisco VA Medical Center ( SFVAMC ) . Demographic clinical data obtain participant 3 test cognitive function 2 week period : 1 ) unsupervised online cognitive testing , 2 ) supervise online cognitive testing , 3 ) standard clinical neuropsychological assessment . The order cognitive evaluation administer equally distribute within sample minimize practice effect . These subject also provide saliva specimen order determine ApoE genotype . Additionally , investigator also conduct small pilot study 34 subject obtain one 3 Tesla MRI scan one PET scan order obtain feasibility data collect longitudinal neuroimaging study participant sample . In addition main validation project MRI/PET substudy , also run substudy ( n=200 ) look validate additional unsupervised online cognitive measure ( administer via iPad application ) call ReVeRe . ReVeRe , automate , self-administered measure verbal memory ( word list recall ) model Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test . This approximately 30 minute procedure administer initially NVP participant 's clinic visit , collect remotely ( participant home ) : ( 1 ) Day 7 initial clinic testing , ( 2 ) Day 21 initial clinic testing , ( 3 ) ongoing 6 month interval least 18 month - total 6 administration .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adults age 60 year old Fluent English Able give inform consent Access ability use internet Evidence diagnosis dementia Evidence acute uncontrolled medical illness Recent history ( &lt; 6 month ) abuse dependence drug and/or alcohol Significant neurological disease ( ex . Parkinson 's disease , Epilepsy , Traumatic brain injury ) Additionally , subject participate neuroimaging portion study , exclude following : Unable unwilling travel SFVAMC UCSF China Basin campuses MRI PET procedure Contraindications MR exam , include claustrophobia , paramagnetic metal implant , inability fit comfortably MRI ( BMI &lt; 38 ) Clinically significant hepatic , renal , pulmonary , metabolic endocrine disturbance indicate history opinion Investigator might pose potential safety risk subject Current clinically significant cardiovascular disease . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease usually include one following : Cardiac surgery myocardial infarction within last 4 week Unstable angina Acute decompensated congestive heart failure class IV heart failure Current significant cardiac arrhythmia conduction disturbance , particularly result ventricular fibrillation , cause syncope , near syncope Uncontrolled high blood pressure QTc &gt; 450 msec History drug alcohol abuse within last year , prior prolonged history abuse Women childbearing potential surgically sterile , refrain sexual activity use reliable method contraception . Women childbearing potential must pregnant breastfeed screen . History relevant severe drug allergy hypersensitivity . Receiving investigational medication FDA IND protocol within last 30 day . Additionally , time last dose previous experimental medication enrollment ( completion screen assessment ) must least equal 5 time terminal halflife previous experimental medication . Subjects ever participate experimental study amyloid target therapy ( e.g. , immunotherapy , secretase inhibitor ) may enrol without prior sponsor approval unless demonstrated patient receive placebo course trial . Current clinically significant unstable medical comorbidities , indicate history pose potential safety risk subject Receiving radiopharmaceutical image therapy within past 24 hour prior image session study Opinion Investigator subject otherwise unsuitable study</criteria>
