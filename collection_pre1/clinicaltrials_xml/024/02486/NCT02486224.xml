	<brief_summary>Kona Deep bottle water extract depth 3000 foot cost Kona , Hawaii . Kona Deep claim unique source provide water `` naturally free pathogen , chemical pollutant rich nutrient mineral readily absorb body '' . The investigator wish examine Kona Deep 's claim water `` beneficial human body '' test impact drink Kona Deep exercise performance recovery . Subjects exercise safe level dehydration rehydrated Kona Deep water , commercially available bottled spring water Gatorade control . Subjects perform simple exercise evaluate peak power performance . This measurement compare rehydration method significant difference .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-exercise Hydration With Deep Sea Mineral Water Exercise Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise-induced dehydration common athletes regularly active individual . Hypohydration , sufficiently severe , negatively impact physical performance mental capacity . Development efficient rehydration therapy could prove beneficial circumstance . Multiple animal study show positive effect desalinate deep-sea mineral water various physiological condition . The beneficial effect deep-sea mineral water may attribute unique mineral composition , particularly magnesium , highly abundant deep-sea water . The investigator wish evaluate whether similar response occur post-exercise rehydration use deep ocean water different source . Kona Deep market Hawaiian glacier water drawn depth 915 Kona coast naturally rich electrolytes nutrient , free mercury , harmful bacterial , pollutant , make desired drinking water source . Accordingly , investigator investigate whether subject administer Kona Deep follow exercise challenge undergo rapid rehydration demonstrate high peak power production compare subject administer commercially available liquid . Euhydrated subject study expose exercise-challenge protocol ( stationary biking ) warm condition ( 30Â°C ) accelerate dehydration . Dehydration measure body mass loss 3-5 % ( maximum exercise time 180 minute ) . A body mass loss 3 % minimal amount lose similar exercise-dehydration protocol significance still observe exercise performance , recovery , physiological parameter . During post-exercise recovery period , subject consume one three liquid volume equivalent 1.5 time body mass lose . Rehydration measure salivary urinary osmolality exercise recovery measure oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) 60 % estimate maximal heart rate peak power production contraction knee extensor exercise , immediately exercise , rehydration period .</detailed_description>
