	<brief_summary>The central hypothesis study TAVR lead platelet deposition inflammatory cell activation attenuate potent anti-platelet and/or pleiotropic effect ticagrelor . This single center , prospective randomize trial address follow specific aim : 1 . To determine whether high-potency ADP receptor blockade reduces measure platelet activation patient TAVR . 2 . To determine whether high-potency ADP receptor blockade mitigate pro-thrombotic inflammatory response observe TAVR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inflammation Thrombosis Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ( TAVR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ( TAVR ) emerge important alternative surgical aortic valve replacement . While technology represent important advance medical therapy surgical AVR poor operative candidate , absolute mortality rate remain high , even great majority optimal hemodynamic result achieve . In randomized literature , majority patient die within two year two third death due cardiovascular ( CV ) event . The mechanism responsible limited survival unclear clinical trial complete date . While persistent valve disease undoubtedly play role subset patient , particularly patient significant aortic regurgitation , majority event due non-valve related co-morbidities . The hypothesis study TAVR result least three simultaneous CV insult : 1 ) abrupt release severely elevate leave ventricular pressure non-compliant systemic vasculature lead generalize endothelial cell activation , 2 ) exposure pro-thrombotic neo-antigenic content degenerate aortic valve ( know histologically resemble atherosclerosis ) , 3 ) exposure replacement valve ( bovine valve , stainless steel frame , polyester wrap ) . The investigator propose proximate event lead platelet activation . Given important link thrombosis inflammation govern platelet-derived mediator leukocyte-platelet interaction , hypothesize monocyte activation mediate , least part , platelet-monocyte interaction , show induce expansion inflammatory monocyte . Given pro-thrombotic nature inflammatory monocyte , suspect positive feedback loop may exist via interplay thrombotic -inflammatory mechanism , may abrogate via high potency ADP-receptor blockade . TRIAL DESIGN Primary Objective Study This trial design determine whether high-potency ADP-receptor blockade ticagrelor , compare standard care clopidogrel , affect platelet responsiveness pattern prothrombotic monocyte activation see early TAVR . Primary Secondary Outcomes The primary endpoint platelet responsiveness : platelet function measure one day TAVR use VerifyNow P2Y12 assay , express platelet reactivity unit . The key secondary outcome measure percentage inflammatory monocyte , measure one day TAVR . Inflammatory monocyte determine flow cytometry , express percentage total monocyte .</detailed_description>
