	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study Acthar Gel Non-Diabetic Hemodialysis [ NDHD ] patient receive dialysis â‰¤ 2 year . The project aim provide proof-of-concept data 80 U two time [ 2x ] week Acthar 6 month safe effective therapy NDHD . Effectiveness low dose 40 U 2X week also determine . Therefore study repeat measure design ( Time x condition ) comparison improvement renal function , nutritional status , quality life physical performance result Acthar therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent report demonstrate Acthar gel effective induce remission proteinuria Nephrotic Syndrome patient ( Bomback 2011 , 2012 ) . There limited publish report document clinical response ( creatinine , proteinuria , serum albumin cholesterol ) ACTHAR therapy non-diabetic hemodialysis population . In addition renal dysfunction high risk mortality , individual receive dialysis also decrease strength , low exercise capacity , poor physical functioning , low quality life ( Edgell 1996 , Johansen , 2001 ) . Strength deficit well documented End Stage Renal Disease [ ESRD ] ( Cheema 2010 , Yoda 2012 ) . There several report document association strength gait deficit measure physical performance person ESRD ( Bohannon 1994 , Fitts 1997 , Segura-Orti 2011 ) . It well know measure physical performance may predict risk fall hospitalization old individual ( Guralnik JM , 2000 ) . Deficits physical performance may compound poor nutritional status . Persons chronic renal disease , particularly context hemodialysis chronic renal replacement therapy , often malnourish and/or affect abnormal micronutrient status ( McMahon 2012 ) . Furthermore , previous study show third acute-care , nephrology-related admission characterize malnutrition ( Lim 2012 ) , affect 23 % - 76 % patient receive hemodialysis ( include outpatient ) ( Blumenkrantz 1980 , Ikizler 1996 , Pecoits-Filho 2002 ) . Decreased functional status concomitant malnutrition contribute increase hospital readmission , prolong length stay ( inevitably , increase medical cost ) , increased morbidity mortality patient ( Isabel 2003 , Lim 2012 ) . Given high prevalence characteristic person renal disease , important prioritize identification novel effective mean sustain improve functional capability patient , maintain nutritional status attenuate malnutrition . To date , report impact Acthar gel therapy renal function , strength , physical performance , nutritional status quality life NDHD patient . This study determine Acthar gel therapy maintain improve overall kidney function measure 24 hour urine study baseline end study period . In addition study determine Acthar gel therapy improve nutritional , physical biochemical status outpatient non-diabetic hemodialysis population .</detailed_description>
