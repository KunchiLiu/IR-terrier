	<brief_title>Minoxidil Dose Response Study Females Identified Through IVD Testing Non-Responders 5 % Topical Minoxidil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately , 40 % woman suffer female pattern hair loss age 55 . Currently , one drug approve US FDA treatment female pattern hair loss ( AGA ) - topical minoxidil . 5 % topical minoxidil maximum dosage approve US FDA treatment female AGA . While topical minoxidil exhibit good safety profile , efficacy overall population relatively low i.e. , 30-40 % re-grow hair . Minoxidil pro-drug . To elicit clinical response , minoxidil must convert active form minoxidil sulfate sulfotransferase enzyme find hair follicle . The investigator develop in-vitro diagnostic test correctly identifies , prior initiate therapy , 95.9 % non-responders 5 % topical minoxidil . The diagnostic test analyze sulfotransferase enzymatic activity hair follicle determine sufficient amount minoxidil convert active form require induce hair growth . Subjects low enzymatic activity experience little therapeutic benefit reduce frequency adverse event . Consequently , investigator hypothesize subject low enzymatic activity ( i.e. , low minoxidil metabolizers ) increase minoxidil dosage elicit therapeutic response little increase frequency adverse event . It thus primary purpose study ass high dosage topical minoxidil dosage ( 15 % ) increase number responder among female subject identify IVD test non-responders 5 % topical minoxidil .</detailed_description>
