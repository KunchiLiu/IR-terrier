	<brief_summary>The overall purpose investigator 's study evaluate cause treatment feed difficulty infant Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) . New treatment possible cause know . Many infant GERD feed difficulty , suck swallow problem , vomit , delay empty stomach . Some infant difficulty protect airway feed reflux , result breathe fluid lung hold breath . Most GERD treatment do base experience , scientific proof method work infant . GERD feed difficulty lead long hospitalization stress family . In clinical trial , investigator develop new method help diagnosis well define well treatment strategy relieve GERD GERD complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) troublesome complication constitute serious diagnostic management challenge development safe feed airway protection strategy among infant convalesce neonatal intensive care unit ; thus contribute prolonged length stay , recurrent hospitalization , death . GERD frequently diagnose inadequate criterion , relative risk , benefit indication GERD therapy unclear . Significant gap knowledge exist understand complex causal adaptive aerodigestive protective reflex mechanism implicate GERD infant . The long-term goal improve digestive health , nutrition , infant development design simplify personalized treatment paradigm well understand pathophysiology aerodigestive reflex . The current objective conduct prospective single center randomize blind control trial compare short term effect investigator innovative feed strategy bundle ( study approach ) versus standard feed approach ( conventional approach ) .</detailed_description>
