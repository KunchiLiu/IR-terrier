	<brief_summary>Consumption carbohydrate contain food sugary drink brings change blood glucose level . After meal drink , blood glucose rise reach peak concentration usually 30 minute . When body sense increase blood glucose , hormonal process involve insulin take place ensure glucose take blood storage need energy body . This process bring decrease concentration glucose reach approximately starting concentration . The original concentration glucose attain approximately 2 hour eat drink carbohydrate food sugary drink respectively healthy people . Different carbohydrate sugary drink different effect blood glucose response depend amount well type carbohydrate . Those give rise high glucose response compare reference carbohydrate ( usually glucose ) say high glycaemic index ( GI ) food low glucose response compare reference carbohydrate ( usually glucose ) say low glycaemic index ( GI ) food . Research show diet give rise high glucose response associate number abnormality like increase risk metabolic syndrome . Metabolic syndrome mostly comprise insulin resistance glucose intolerance give increase risk type 2 diabetes . It also give rise condition like high blood pressure ( arterial hypertension ) , elevate blood insulin level ( hyper-insulinemia ) , elevate amount fat liver ( fatty hepatosis ) elevate amount lipid blood ( dyslipidemia ) . After type 2 diabetes become clinically apparent , risk cardiovascular disease also rise . Research also show foods/drinks raise blood glucose level gradually ( low GI ) rather rapidly ( high GI ) health benefit include reduce risk metabolic syndrome . Laboratory study show polyphenols find fruit , vegetable plant base food positive effect carbohydrate metabolism lower blood glucose level . This research determine whether presence polyphenols diet lower effect blood glucose level hence glycaemic index food . This determine ask volunteer consume commercially available food supplement together white bread determine glycaemic response . The blood glucose response bread determine initially control reference . All consume random order . Analysis do measure blood glucose response consumption control reference meal test meal contain polyphenols determine incremental area glucose curve . POMEGRANATE AND OLIVE STUDIES WILL BE TREATED SEPARATELY FOR PURPOSES OF PUBLISHING RESULTS . EACH STUDY WILL AIM TO HAVE AT LEAST 16 PARTICIPANTS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The world health organisation report 220 million people suffer diabetes worldwide year 2030 , number double . The WHO also report 2004 , 3.4 million people died high blood sugar . About 90 % diabetes case due type II diabetes . Type 2 diabetes largely due overweight lack physical activity characterise high glucose level ( hyperglycaemia ) . In human diet , source blood glucose carbohydrate . Dietary carbohydrate important maintain glycaemic homeostasis provide energy diet people . The control blood glucose hormonal process important human physiology . Hormonal process involve release insulin β- cell pancreatic cell stimulates uptake glucose meal , tissue either utilisation ( glycolysis ) store liver glycogen ( glycogenesis ) . When blood glucose fall normal , glucagon secrete pancreatic α-cells promotes liver glucose production induce generation glucose non-carbohydrate substrate amino fatty acid ( gluconeogenesis ) generation glucose glycogen ( glycogenolysis ) . When glucose homeostasis hormonal control fail , entail high blood glucose level ( postprandial hyperglycaemia ) lead metabolic syndrome include obesity , impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , hypertension dyslipidemia . Disturbance glucose homeostasis also lead symptom inflammation oxidative stress whole body level well disturbances functionality several organ well diabetes . Therefore , much carbohydrate require human body major source energy , much diet adverse health effect especially one high glycaemic effect . The propose mechanism adapt Aston , 2006 carbohydrate may affect human health continual presence high glycaemic index food diet , give rise postprandial glucose rise well high insulin demand act high blood glucose level blood . Postprandial glucose rise high insulin demand may lead insulin resistance major component metabolic syndrome . High insulin demand may also lead β-cell failure may also result hyperglycaemia also cause insulin resistance . Insulin resistance hyperglycaemia risk factor metabolic syndrome diabetes type 2 . Scientific evidence suggest postprandial hyperglycaemia human major role play health priority like type 2 diabetes blood glucose control . It report 90 % diabetes case consist type 2 diabetes . Apart type I type 2 diabetes , related condition include pre-diabetes ( impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) impair fast glucose ( IFG ) well metabolic syndrome ( obesity , hypertension insulin resistance ) . It report pre-diabetes metabolic syndrome increase risk develop cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus . The glycaemic index originally propose aim manage diabetes . However , recent study show GI potential prevention type 2 diabetes well treatment metabolic syndrome . Research show high GI diet associate increase risk develop type 2 diabetes . More research show high GI diet associate number abnormality like increase metabolic syndrome insulin resistance . In way , low GI diet say improve insulin sensitivity research need support . A study show case . However observed difficult know whether result improve insulin sensitivity , improve insulin secretion due reduce rate glucose absorption . Potential solution Having anything diet either slow digestion absorption carbohydrates help reduce risk . Among others , two potential solution consumption low glycaemic index food ingredient diet reduce glycaemic index food well postprandial blood glucose level . The presence inhibit component diet reduce postprandial glucose also solution reduce risk . Drugs like acarbose currently use country management type 2 diabetes act inhibit carbohydrate digestive enzyme . However , use acarbose side effect nausea , flatulence diarrhoea . It report polyphenols also potential inhibit rise blood glucose hinder rapid absorption glucose . A recent review report research use animal model well limited number human study , show polyphenols polyphenol rich food beverages potential affect postprandial glycaemic response fast glycaemia well improvement acute insulin secretion sensitivity . Other possible mechanism report review include pancreatic β- cell stimulation secrete insulin well activation insulin receptor , modulation release glucose liver well intracellular signal pathway gene expression . Another recent review conclude possible effect polyphenols diet affect glycaemic index food well postprandial glucose response human . The two mechanism highlight achieved inhibition sugar metabolise enzymes well transporter . This potential action polyphenols thus compare acarbose act mechanism research chronic intervention study show reduces diabetes risk . This research involve use pomegranate olive supplement source polyphenols . The study approve University Leeds Mathematical Physical Sciences ( MAPs ) ethical committee application number MEEC14-029 . At least 16 volunteer recruit supplement ( pomegranate olive ) . The volunteer screen fast blood glucose level . They need healthy fast blood glucose level fall within healthy range 4.3-5.9mmol/L . The volunteer schedule attend 3 visit . During visit , volunteer come fasted morning fast blood glucose measure use glucometer . The volunteer give test meal randomize blood glucose measure 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120,150 180 minute first bite test meal . The result use plot area curve result obtain consume test meal compare obtained consumption control meal . POMEGRANATE AND OLIVE STUDIES WILL BE TREATED SEPARATELY FOR PURPOSES OF PUBLISHING RESULTS . EACH STUDY WILL AIM TO HAVE AT LEAST 16 PARTICIPANTS .</detailed_description>
