	<brief_summary>Basal insulin widely use old patient diabetes . Human insulin Neutral Protamine Hagedorn ( NPH ) propose basal insulin older ( 75 year old ) frail dependent patient due short action . However , study analyse glycaemic profile elderly subject accord basal insulin use , particularly frail disable patient . The aim study measure intra-day glycaemic variability accord basal insulin ( human NPH long act analogue ) old ( 75 old ) frail disable patient diabetes use continuous glucose monitoring system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daily Glycaemic Variability Frail Disabled Older Patients With Diabetes Over 75 Treated With Basal Insulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increased prevalence diabetes mellitus large part relate ageing : France 2009 , 26 % patient diabetes 75 older . Moreover , diabetes prevalence particularly high among institutionalized subject half treated insulin . Diabetes source activity limitation participation restriction early stage disease responsible 10 % direct health cost , high cost old patient insulin treated patient . Older patient diabetes may robust ( fully independent ) , frail disable . Studies patient 75 year old include mainly robust subject . Nevertheless old patient diabetes frequently frail large proportion different metabolic profile young one : leaner present often beta-cellular insufficiency . Frail dependent patient may also different nutritional status robust one . Thus , difficult extrapolate know glycaemic profile robust young old ( 65-74 year old ) insulin-treated patient frail dependent old one ( &gt; 74 year ) . Continuous blood glucose monitor system give opportunity measure around day blood glucose variation real-life particularly nocturnal hypoglycaemia patient treat various type basal insulin .</detailed_description>
