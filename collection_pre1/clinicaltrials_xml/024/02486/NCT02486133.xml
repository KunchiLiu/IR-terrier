	<brief_summary>A switch strategy investigate whether dual therapy Ritonavir-boosted ( RTV ) Darunavir ( DRV ) + Dolutegravir ( DTG ) 48 week non-inferior continuous standard care therapy RTV-boosted DRV combination 2 Nucleosidic Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NRTIs ) HIV patient , stable antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) RTV-boosted DRV combination 2 NRTIs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual Therapy With Boosted Darunavir + Dolutegravir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Modern combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) lead well-controlled HIV infection potentially normal life expectancy . Nucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) play major role `` ART backbone '' essential antiretroviral agent accord current European WHO HIV treatment guideline . However , NRTI use associate substantial side effect , e.g . bone kidney toxicity , lipotoxicity mitochondrial toxicity put patient serious risk . Especially long-term NRTI-exposure risk factor often cumulative side effect , since standard care ( SOC ) therapy different NRTIs consist combination multiple substance . Furthermore NRTI resistance may emerge time limit treatment option pre-treated HIV patient . As consequence , alternative NRTI free ( call `` nuke sparing '' ) therapy option evaluate different study associate less virologic therapeutic success high rate therapy induced resistance compare standard regimen ART naïve patient . This particularly true patient high baseline viral load . As alternative NRTI-based therapy option , Ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor ( PI/r ) -based nuke-sparing dual therapy study widely , mostly combination integrase inhibitor ( INI ) Raltegravir ( RAL ) . In set , PI fully capable prevent development INI resistant virus . The HIV protease inhibitor Darunavir ( DRV ) novel INI Dolutegravir ( DTG ) potent anchor drug high barrier resistance . Due favourable side-effect profile , once-daily ( QD ) formulation virological potency , DRV currently one frequently use PIs Europe USA . In addition , new , once-daily administrable integrase inhibitor DTG show excellent tolerability profile well high resistance barrier . The nuke-free combination DTG ( 50 mg ) Ritonavir ( /r ) - Cobicistat-boosted protease inhibitor DRV ( 800 mg ) may offer favorable safety efficacy profile advantage QD-dosing .</detailed_description>
