	<brief_summary>Suriname small develop country South America population half million people . Early neonatal death Suriname high 16 per 1000 live birth . Unpublished data Suriname Perinatal Infant Mortality Survey estimate contribution infection early neonatal mortality 25 % ( 4 per 1000 live birth ) death . In comparison , incidence rate neonatal sepsis alone 3.5 per 1000 live birth . These number indicate increase burden neonatal infection Suriname versus U.S . In case 40 newborn die year infection huge loss , also consider small Surinamese community . Despite overall idea impact infectious disease Surinamese neonates exact information regard incidence , type infection ( e.g. , localize , viral , early-onset late-onset sepsis ) , risk factor ( e.g. , insufficient antenatal care , maternal Group B-Streptococcus status ) , etiology , microbial cause , morbidity , antibiotic treatment ( type duration ) , epidemiological determinant ( e.g. , gestational age , sex , ethnicity ) lacking . From clinical perspective , still challenge identify neonate infection . Neonates often admit ambivalent clinical symptom receive preventive antibiotic costly , promote pathogen-resistance , negative long-term effect ( i.e. , development intestinal bacterial flora ) . Currently , assessment blood leukocyte trombocyte count level CRP insufficiently sensitive used biomarkers , confirmation actual sepsis meningitis positive culture result relatively rare ( 0.5-3 % United States ) . This complicate decision duration antibiotic treatment hospitalization significantly , biomarkers exist . The circulating isoforms adhesion molecule ( cAMs ) , mediate interaction leukocytes vascular endothelium , propose biomarkers infection sepsis . During infection accumulate bloodstream result shed , represent removal cell surface endothelial cell leukocytes enzyme call sheddases . Recently , review mechanism behind shed cAMs neonatal , pediatric adult sepsis . The shed process reflect critical active process orchestrate interaction leukocytes endothelium effective host response , minimize collateral tissue damage . As result , plasma level cAMs sheddases subject change infection sepsis . Additionally , compel , albeit limited , data suggest change level cAMs CSF adult pediatric meningitis . To date , evidence exists change level cAMs malaria ( child Malawi ) sepsis , although sensitive enough predict outcome clinic . Those level never assess simultaneously level sheddases blood CSF diagnostic tool . We propose combine approach may provide detailed information extent inflammatory activation neonates.While balance level maintain rest condition mild ( local ) infection , may perturb sepsis meningitis . Thus , simultaneous measurement level could promote early identification infection , may even distinguish mild infection , systemic infection meningitis . Currently , manufacturer rapidly develop Luminex® technology advance , fast , high-throughput clinically feasible bedside tool approach . We hypothesize incidence rate neonates infection Suriname high . We hypothesize , upon sign infection , simultaneous measurement cAMs SEs serum CSF discriminate infect non-infected neonate . We aim : 1 ) identify follow neonate Academic Hospital Paramaribo sign infection establish incidence rate infection , 2 ) investigate diagnostic potential propose biomarker combination neonates infection , type infection ( e.g. , local ( mild ) , sepsis meningitis ) outcomes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infection , Sepsis Meningitis Surinamese Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : The Academic Hospital Paramaribo ( AZP ) large perinatal care facility Suriname . Recently , AZP open country 's neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . This study aim include neonate present high medium care facility clinical sign infection , sepsis meningitis ( age : 0-1 month ) require infection work . Along inclusion neonate follow detailed epidemiological description newborns infectious disease . Inclusion take place one 10 resident , approval one 5 attending pediatrician . Along standard blood draw infection parameter ( t=0 t=48 hour ) , blood culture ( t=0 hour ) CSF culture ( t=0 hour ) , serum CSF separate biomarker study . For neonate , normal local protocol management infection , sepsis meningitis follow . This include antibiotic treatment 7 day 1 ) clinical suspicion infection admission high ; 2 ) infection parameter aberrant 48 hour ; 3 ) blood culture positive . Otherwise , antibiotic treatment stop 48 hour . Further protocol include necessary change respiratory support , circulatory ( fluid ) support feed . Medical treatment cardiotonics treatment hyperglycemia seizure . Neonates divide 5 group base course antibiotic treatment culture result : 1 ) Baseline control ( sign infection ) : neonate admit serial blood draw t=0 48 hour uncomplicated hyperbilirubinemia ( jaundice , without sign infection ) ; 2 ) Signs infection , divide : 2a ) No infection : antibiotic stop 48 hour ; negative culture ; 2b ) Clinical infection : 7 day antibiotic ; negative culture ; 2c ) Sepsis : positive bacterial blood culture ; 2d ) Meningitis : positive bacterial CSF culture . Sample size power : Sample size power analysis complicate The Suriname Perinatal Infant Mortality Survey provide data mortality result infection ( amongst cause ) , without data incidence neonatal infection . We estimate incidence admission clinical sign infection 50 per 1000 live birth ( 5 % ) NICU AZP . An annual birth rate AZP 3000 live birth per year give u n=150 neonate sign infection divide four group . Based estimation recommend sample size whole population would n=1538 ( margin error 1 % CI 99 % ) . Since incidence newborn exclusion criterion apply incidence subgroup currently unknown , compensate loss follow , decide include one-year period ( n=3000 ) . The biomarker study exploratory nature aim baseline control group n=40 ( large n may difficult establish due practical constraint ) . In analysis adjust gestational age ethnicity . Absence prior data level biomarkers relation neonatal infection prevents u estimate power . With analysis serum CSF 150 inclusion aim perform future follow-up biomarker study . Methodology : Epidemiology : The follow data record upon ( t=0 hour ) ( t=48 hour ) admission : date time , maternal age , gender , maternal Group-B-streptococcus culture result , maternal fever , ( premature ) prolong rupture membrane ( ( P ) PROM ) , gestational age ( unknown accord Ballard ) , delivery location mode , Apgar score , birth weight , gender , ethnicity , leukocyte count differentiation , trombocyte count , CRP , antibiotic treatment ( type , duration ) , sepsis ( early/late onset , line ) , survival/expiration . The Score Neonatal Acute Physiology II score t=0 48 hour . . Serum separation : Whole blood collect vena puncture one serum microtainer ( 500 μL ) . Serum sample separate centrifugation 2500 xg 15 minute keep ice storage . All serum CSF sample store -80°C central laboratory AZP . Batched serum CSF sample package dry-ice ( max . 24 hour ; accord International Air Transport Association guideline ) transport Endothelial Biomedicine Vascular Drug Targeting Laboratory Groningen . Luminex® Technology : Our laboratory Groningen extensive experience use Luminex® array measurement multiple adhesion molecule clinical patient sample ( i.e. , multiplexing ) . Currently , technique apply successfully basic translational research gradually make way clinic , allow compilation diagnostic multi-array molecule complex disease , sepsis cancer . See Table 1 specific adhesion molecule associate shed enzyme include array . Measurement soluble L- , E- , P-selectin , Intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM-1 ) , vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM-1 ) , neutrophil elastase ( NE ) , Matrix-metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , tissue-inhibitor metalloproteinase ( TIMP-1 ) ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 ( ADAM-17 ) perform Luminex® ; NE ADAM-17 analyze ELISA long Luminex® yet available molecule . We also use Luminex® measure circulate Angiopoetin-1 -2 , soluble Tie-2 receptor marker endothelial cell activation . For Luminex® assay ( Life Technologies ) appropriate dilute volume sample aliquoted 96 well plate . Simultaneous analysis take place Luminex® 100 Analyzer ( Life Technologies ) . ELISA perform accord manufacturer protocol ( R &amp; D system ) . Statistical Analysis : Incidence rate end epidemiological determinant calculated end inclusion period . Categorical variable present number percentage continuous variable mean +/- SD , normally distribute , median +/- 10th percentile . Categorical data compare chi-square continuous variable independent t-test two-way ANOVA . To assess independent effect biomarker combination ( cAM/SE ratio ) occurrence infection multivariate logistic regression perform infection dependent cAM/SE ratio , gestational age ethnicity independent variable . We calculate Spearman rank correlation ass bivariable association biomarkers . Diagnostic accuracy cAM/SE ratio assess use Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) -based area curve . Other test characteristic predictive value likelihood ratio calculate . P-values &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Statistical analysis perform use Stata ( StataCorp ) . Difficulties Limitations : First , separation serum neonate could lead low volume , yet Luminex® technology design assessment high number molecule low volume . According local protocol , CSF collection perform baseline control neonate suspect meningitis . Measurement two time-points may insufficient detect change time . We able identify viral cause infection , since proper diagnostics currently available Suriname . Ethical concern Surinamese situation : We receive approval Surinamese Ethical Board March 9th 2015 .
