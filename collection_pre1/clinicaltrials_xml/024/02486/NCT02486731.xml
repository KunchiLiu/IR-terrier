	<brief_summary>Noonan LEOPARD syndromes share , variable severity , different clinical trait , notably craniofacial manifestation , cardiopathy , short stature , juvenile cancer . The main genetic cause syndrome missense mutation gene encode ubiquitous tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 , find half patient NS 80 % LS case . Shp2 play pivotal role development , growth , metabolism regulate key signal pathway ( Ras/Mitogen activate protein kinase ( MAPK ) , Phosphoinositide-3 Kinases ( PI3K ) /Akt ) response growth factors/hormones . Deregulation signal pathway causally link NS LS pathophysiology . This project aim well understanding hormonal sensitivity abnormality patient Noonan syndrome ( NS ) LEOPARD syndrome ( LS ) cause mutation tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 . To reach goal , investigator take advantage different tissue ( fibroblast Â± adipocytes ) patient NS / LS compare healthy control . All patient skin biopsy patient undergo surgery adipose tissue biopsy .</brief_summary>
