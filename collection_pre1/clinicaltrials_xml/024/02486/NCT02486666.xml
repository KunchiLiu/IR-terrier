	<brief_title>A Pilot Feasibility And Safety Multicenter Trial Of Administering Weight FiXET Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The use low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) treatment neonatal pediatric thrombosis first report 1996 . They conduct dose finding study use LMWH enoxaparin 25 child age newborn 17 year . Their work provide preliminary data excellent safety efficacy profile enoxaparin treatment thrombosis pediatric population . They discover two important concept relation dose monitoring enoxaparin neonate . First , neonates require high dose enoxaparin ( 1.64 mg/kg/dose twice daily ) compare old child ( 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily ) achieve therapeutic anticoagulation , evaluate anti-Xa level . Second , enoxaparin therapy must monitor anti-factor Xa ( anti-Xa ) level activate partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) . In therapeutic range 0.5-1.0 u/ml , enoxaparin minimal effect APTT . Subsequent work , many investigator study use enoxaparin LMWHs , include dalteparin , tinzaparin nadroparin , prospectively . The common emerge theme study neonate require high dose maintain therapeutic anti-Xa level compare old child . These paper form basis current dose guideline . Enoxaparin dose 1.5 mg/kg treatment 0.75 mg/kg prophylaxis neonate . Subsequent initial study , report suggest neonate may require even high enoxaparin dos attain maintain therapeutic anti-Xa level . A literature review 2008 suggest increase enoxaparin dose 1.7 mg/kg term 2.0 mg/kg premature neonates . Since 2008 , study replicate find . Of note group compare 75 neonate treat initial enoxaparin dose 1.5 mg/kg 1.7 mg/kg . They find neonate treat 1.7 mg/kg dose therapeutic anti-Xa level 0.57 units/mL ( u/mL ) , patient supratherapeutic . And take 1 day versus 2 day treat low dose reach therapeutic range . Others similar finding cohort . These two study also include premature neonate find patient require even high enoxaparin dose 2.0-2.2 mg/kg maintain therapeutic anti-Xa level . There substantial evidence literature suggest premature term neonate require high dose enoxaparin order achieve therapeutic anti-Xa level . Monitoring LMWH therapy neonate ongoing challenge . The therapeutic range anti-Xa ( 0.50-1.0 u/mL ) extrapolate adult study . These parameter since adopt consensus guideline use research study . There limited evidence correlate anti-Xa level resolution thrombosis incidence hemorrhage . Additionally , significant variability among commonly use anti-Xa assay clinical practice . There two type anti-Xa assay : 1 ) exogenous AT add 2 ) without exogenous AT . The addition exogenous AT allow measurement LMWH effect without influence AT deficiency ( present ) , whereas anti-Xa assay without exogenous AT allow measurement vivo LMWH effect . Studies compare different anti-Xa assay find lack correlation . In recent study , author show change anti-Xa assay result average 33 % change anti-Xa value , significantly affect dose enoxaparin treat patient . For patient age &lt; 3 month , 0.35 mg/kg change mean enoxaparin dose maintain therapeutic anti-Xa level anti-Xa assay change author 's institution . Along methodical issue surround use anti-Xa assay , important clinical resource issue consider . The need multiple venipuncture blood sample required monitor anti-Xa level significant cause pain neonate frustration health care professional charge find accessible vein frequently . Also , many center treat neonate thrombosis finance afford resource , equipment , anti-Xa assay , personnel , require testing . These center routinely treat patient weight-adjusted fix dose enoxaparin . There evidence present suggest effective safe approach . There , hence , need systematically study utility anti-Xa monitoring neonatal population . Aims The aim trial determine feasibility safety randomize control trial compare approach treat thrombosis neonate enoxaparin use weight adjust fix dose variable dose titrate maintain pre-determined anti-Xa range ( 0.5-1.0 u/mL ) . METHODS/DESIGN Recruitment start July , 2015 . This occur 6 month per center may take 1 year . Analysis dissemination occur period time . The study expect completed October , 2016 . Study design The FiXET trial prospective pilot , feasibility safety multicenter , randomize control trial . Study set participant The neonatal intensive care unit four tertiary hospital Canada participate trial . The investigator plan recruit total 20 patient base follow protocol-defined inclusion exclusion criterion . Sample size The purpose large randomize control trial ( RCT ) establish non-inferiority administer weight adjust fix dose enoxaparin comparison variable dose titrated maintain anti-Xa level 0.5-1.0 u/mL . Considering difference le 10 % clinical importance use 80 % estimate complete/partial response rate group , sample size require achieve 80 % power alpha 0.05 would 396 subject . In order conduct RCT among 10-12 center 3 year , expect accrual would 0.9-1.1 subject per month per center , depend size center . In trial , investigator plan assess feasibility recruit least 5 subject 6 month period per center . The overall sample size among 4 center would 20 subject . Randomization All patient begin treatment enoxaparin per treatment protocol . Patients enrol randomized prior 1st anti-Xa level result . The randomization sequence generate computer program ratio 1:1 among two arm use minimization method . Allocation concealment blind The current pilot study open label concealment allocation . The large RCT blind allocation conceal appropriate manner deem study team statistician . Treatment protocol The enoxaparin dose patient base current available evidence discuss background section . Premature neonates receive 2.0 mg/kg/dose round near whole mg twice daily , term neonate receive 1.7 mg/kg/dose round near whole mg twice daily . Patients blood sample anti-Xa level draw 3rd 4th dose start adjustment , follow weekly admit hospital monthly discharge . Patients appropriate image accord institutional guideline , must include least end treatment imaging . The duration enoxaparin therapy 6 week 6 month discretion treat physician . Interventions This trial two arm . 1 . Experimental Arm : experimental arm patient dose titration regardless anti-Xa level . An outline step take patient anti-Xa level outside therapeutic range include protocol . 2 . Control Arm : patient dose titration base anti-Xa level maintain therapeutic range 0.5-1.0 u/mL . Primary Outcome The primary outcome trial ass feasibility safety , define , administer weight adjust fix dose enoxaparin neonate thrombosis . Feasibility criterion - At least 10 subject recruit 4 participate center 6 month period - At least 50 % approached patient recruit - Complete data collection follow-up least 90 % recruited subject Safety criterion - No 20 % subject remove study due - Low high anti-Xa level - Major bleed Major bleeding define ( ) fatal bleeding ; ( ii ) clinically overt bleed result associated decrease hemoglobin 20 g/L ( 2 g/dL ) 24 hour period ; ( ii ) bleed critical organ ( intracranial , pulmonary retroperitoneal ) ; bleed require surgical intervention . Minor bleeding define overt macroscopic evidence bleeding fulfill criterion major bleed . Secondary outcome Secondary outcome measure include 1 ) efficacy resolution thrombosis ; 2 ) mean anti-Xa level ; 3 ) number enoxaparin dose adjustment require control arm ; 4 ) number venipuncture attempt blood sample patient . Statistical Analysis The safety efficacy intervention evaluate intention-to-treat basis eligible patient randomize trial . Demographic parameter , normally distribute , report mean standard deviation compare use Student 's test analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . Non-normally distribute data report median interquartile range compare appropriate non-parametric test ( Kruskal-Wallis one way ANOVA ) . Categorical data report number percentage compare use chi-square Fisher exact test indicate . A two-sided P value 0.05 used indicate statistical significance . Ethics approval trial registration The trial approve Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board . All participate trial site require obtain ethic approval local research ethic board . Clinical trial application submit Health Canada recruitment begin upon approval . Funding This trial fund . DISCUSSION The administration weight adjust fix dose enoxaparin without anti-Xa monitoring potential reduce pain multiple venipuncture neonates well resource use care . The result FiXET trial provide preliminary clinical data regard feasibility safety approach anticoagulation treatment neonate . It also provide preliminary idea efficacy approach . This trial , successful , set groundwork large multicenter randomize control trial compare efficacy administer enoxaparin neonate without monitor current conventional approach routine monitoring anti-Xa level . Trial status Health Canada approval obtain . NOL control # 190308</detailed_description>
