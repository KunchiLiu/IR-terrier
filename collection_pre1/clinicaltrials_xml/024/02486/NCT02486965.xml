The aim study evaluation specific train program control pain fibromyalgia patient balance stress axis . The primary endpoint improvement Visual Analogue Scale VAS difference ) measure test thermode ( difference average VAS measure 10th 40th second P1 average VAS measure 10th 40th second P3 ) D0 ( 3rd consultation ) M24 ( 5th consultation - end study visit ) , compare two groups..Salivary cortisol also test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Specific Training Program Neuromodulation Pain Fibromyalgia Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A specific training program guidance physiotherapist , professor Adapted Physical Activity ( APA ) individualize whose objective strengthen parasympathetic tone modulate reactivity sympathetic system report Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal ( HPA ) axis.This train program consist three session 45 minute physical activity per week 2 year . The exercise intensity initially low gradually increase accord ability tolerance stress . A 6-Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) carry physiotherapist Professor APA , every 6 month monitor progression . For track train program , phone call schedule every week first 3 month , phone call every 15 day follow month end study.Evaluation neuromodulation pain measure thanks thermodeTest , experimental method implement tonic thermal pain use `` Peltier type Thermode '' 3 cm2 model TSA II immersion bath cold water . Participants randomly assign 2 group , `` Training '' group `` Control '' group . The control group train program supervise physical therapist teacher Adapted Physical Activity , identical active program follow-up , intensity session low . Study schedule : - 1st visit : screening visit D-30 - 2nd visit : inclusion D-7 - 3rd visit D0 - 4st visit M6 M9 - 5th visit M24 The patient include study receive addition training program , take bio-psycho-social multidisciplinary .</detailed_description>
