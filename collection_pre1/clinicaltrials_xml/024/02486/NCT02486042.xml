	<brief_summary>Retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) blind disease affect infant bear prematurely . These infant enough essential fatty acid structurally support retina , nerve tissue eye allow u see . A recent study show give omega-3 ( n-3 ) fatty acids infant soon birth make less likely need invasive treatment eye disease . This research trial give young infant bear prematurely n-3 fish oil treatment look change factor blood promote disease . Detailed blood study compare infant without ROP perform infant follow time ass eye development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega-3 LCPUFA Supplementation Very Low Birth Weight Infants The Prevention Retinopathy Prematurity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 517,000 infant bear prematurely every year . As low birth weight premature infant survive longer , risk develop severe retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) . ROP disease eye affect prematurely-born baby . It think cause disorganized growth retinal blood vessel may result scar retinal detachment . ROP mild may resolve spontaneously , may lead blindness serious case . ROP lead cause irreversible childhood blindness United States . As , preterm baby risk ROP , low birth weight important risk factor . Researchers find increase omega-3 fatty acid decrease omega-6 fatty acid diet mouse eye disease similar ROP reduce area blood vessel loss abnormal blood vessel growth . These finding represent new evidence suggest possibility omega-3 fatty acid act protective factor disease affect retinal blood vessel . Omega-3 fatty acid make compound protect growth abnormal blood vessel prevent inflammation . In two European study , treatment decrease risk need laser treatment eye ROP . This study yet repeat United States . The purpose study learn omega-3 fatty acid supplementation low birth weight infant change blood profile infant receive nutritional treatment . Infants enrol study shortly birth receive IV and/or oral supplementation full term retinal blood vessel completely develop , shortly term . Once treatment , infant continue follow growth development eye .</detailed_description>
