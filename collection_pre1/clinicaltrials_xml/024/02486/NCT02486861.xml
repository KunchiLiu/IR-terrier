	<brief_title>OCT-Features Culprit Not Culprit Coronary Plaque ACS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION . Pathophysiology Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) deeply differs stable patient , mainly due peculiar feature plaque . Interestingly , lesion trigger acute ischemic event , usually define `` culprit lesion '' angiographically severe , present mild stenosis . However , evaluate autopsy intracoronary imaging , show often pro-thrombotic pattern , thin cap fibroatheroma , soft plaque thrombus , prone rupture . Patients without culprit plaque rupture ( CPR ) exhibit different mechanism instability include thrombus site plaque erosion , intense vasoconstriction epicardial artery coronary microcirculation disfunction . In set , last year Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) emerge accurate instrument intracoronary evaluation . Due resolution approximately 10-20 Âµm largely exploit evaluation characterization plaque feature , stable acute coronary artery disease . On hand , despite recent evidence , characteristic culprit plaque different subset patient well define . Moreover clinical significance plaque characteristic unknown . METHODS The OCT-FORMIDABLE register include retrospective fashion consecutive patient perform OCT culprit culprit plaque subset patient ACS . Clinical OCT data include register accord dataset . SAMPLE SIZE : recent paper Niccoli et al show percentage plaque rupture 60 % ACS . According paper Pedruzzi et al , least 100 patient need evaluate independent predictive power clinical presentation ( STEMI vs NSTEMI v UA ) , diabetes mellitus , previous use aspirin , statin age . OCT ANALYSIS Different OCT system analysis technique ( different pullback velocity 75 mm v 54 mm , contrast mediate ringer lactate injection ) report . Each center evaluate OCT image internal committee compose least two people . In case discordance external opinion require . Plaque rupture define presence fibrous cap discontinuity lead communication inner ( necrotic ) core plaque lumen . Plaque rupture include also fibrous cap disruption detect calcified plaque characterize protrude calcification , superficial calcium , presence substantive calcium proximal distal lesion . Thin cap fibro atheroma define cap thickness &lt; 65 nm . Thin cap fibro atheroma rupture site report . Fibrocalcific , fibrotic plaque , lipid component macrophage infiltration define accord recent propose criterion report . Data divide accord clinical significance study plaque , particular culprit plaque , culprit plaque culprit vessel culprit plaque vessel . Moreover recode OCT analysis change interventional cardiologist approach decide culprit lesion treat . CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP AND ENDPOINT DEFINITION A clinical follow-up least 12 month discharge evaluate . The primary endpoint correlation OCT characteristic incidence major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACEs define composite death cardiac cause , non- fatal MI , clinically driven target vessel revascularization ( TVR ) , re-hospitalization due unstable progressive angina accord Braunwald Unstable Angina Classification ) clinical baseline characteristic . In particular subanalysis perform follow subgroup : culprit plaque , culprit plaque culprit vessel , culprit plaque different vessel .</detailed_description>
