	<brief_summary>The study aim examine whether neurofeedback method ( base functional magnetic resonance image [ fMRI ] ) help patient alcohol dependence control urge drink alcohol thus remain abstinent . Potential effect neurofeedback abstinence drink behaviour evaluate base comparison group patient receive multiple session neurofeedback train group patient receive treatment usual period time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neurofeedback non-invasive neuroscientific tool participant receive real-time feedback brain activity undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging . Previous research show participant successfully use feedback self-regulate brain response . In study patient successfully complete detoxification programme train down-regulate/upregulate response motivational brain region activate exposure alcohol/life goal-related stimulus ( picture alcoholic drinks/life goal relate ) . The investigator hypothesise learn self-regulate neural response enable patient well control crave response environmental alcohol cue detoxification treatment . Patients intervention group undergo 6 neurofeedback training session , spread across 4 month . Outcomes train compare group patient neurofeedback train receive standard treatment ( e.g . support group medication ) .</detailed_description>
