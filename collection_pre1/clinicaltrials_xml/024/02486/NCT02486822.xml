	<detailed_description>After many century vaginal delivery ( VD ) safe route birth , Cesarean section ( CS ) emerge alternative emergency situation .

The WHO partograph famous chart commonly use observe uncomplicated labour almost objective approach guide interference . Unfortunately , rule partograph reduce incidence CS questionable . Furthermore , design partograph exactly perfect present process labour . For reason , labour scale design novel follow-up chart labour . The chart consider objective timed management labour flexible range time base recent evidence . A previous pilot study 77 woman suggest labour scale may good alternative current partograph . This study first randomize trial compare 2 chart regard rate CS , maternal neonatal health outcome patient obstetrician satisfaction . In clinical trial , investigator aim compare labour scale traditional WHO partograph term incidence labor dystocia CS well maternal neonatal outcome</detailed_description>
