	<detailed_description>The knowledge brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) derive mainly study rodent cold important regulator BAT development function . Yet , little known regulation BAT human . With study investigator aim investigate effect seasonal change outdoor temperature genetic marker BAT human deep neck adipose tissue . Project participants patient admit Aarhus University Hospital elective neck surgery . Operations primarily due suspect malignancy thyroid gland hyperparathyroidism.No additional surgery necessary obtain biopsy .</detailed_description>
