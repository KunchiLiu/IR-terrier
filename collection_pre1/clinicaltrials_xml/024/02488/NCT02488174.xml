	<brief_summary>Severe acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) require prolonged mechanical ventilation common form acute organ dysfunction hospital , often associate multiple organ failure ( MOF ) , high mortality , functional impairment . Most study ARF focused patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) mechanical ventilation day end organ damage already establish . The overall goal propose project improve outcome patient high risk develop severe ARF prolong mechanical ventilation outside ICU . The project aim intervene early high risk patient electronic medical record ( EMR ) -based , patient-centered checklist common critical care practice aim prevent lung injury hospital acquire adverse event commonly lead organ failure ( Prevention Organ Failure checklist -PROOFcheck ) . This application propose stepped-wedge , cluster randomize control trial determine utility PROOFcheck improve survival reduce duration mechanical ventilation multiple organ failure patient identify high risk progress severe ARF prolong mechanical ventilation . The aim UH2 phase : 1 ) refine previously validate Lung Injury Prediction Score pragmatic , EMR-based early prediction model Accurately Predict Prolonged Ventilation ( APPROVE ) , automatically identify patient anywhere hospital high risk develop severe ARF require mechanical ventilation &gt; 48 hour ; 2 ) incorporate PROOFcheck EMR prompt clinician care practice limit lung injury , prevent adverse event , avoid additional organ failure ; 3 ) establish infrastructure propose trial . The propose pragmatic trial harness hospital-wide EMR identify patient high risk prolong mechanical ventilation APPROVE intervention PROOFcheck . As , propose trial aim break clinical silo care currently organize hospital bring patient-centered , context appropriate care acutely ill patient wherever whenever patient 's condition require .</brief_summary>
