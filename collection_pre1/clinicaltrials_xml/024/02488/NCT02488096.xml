	<brief_title>Improving Prostate Cancer Detection Using MRI-Targeted TRUS-Guided Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accurately diagnose clinically significant prostate cancer time benefit treatment outweigh harm continue elude clinician complex nature prostate cancer . When patient find high prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) blood test , abnormal digital rectal exam , prostate cancer delay treatment ( active surveillance ) , refer transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) guide biopsy . The sensitivity TRUS 12-core biopsy 53-68 % cancer miss , particularly anterior region prostate . In case , TRUS use rule cause abnormal test finding , however specificity TRUS also fairly poor make difficult man know certain cancer free . Unfortunately , biopsy also cause serious side effect include incontinence , bowel dysfunction , infection pain . Increasing number core take biopsy typically translate good detection rate . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) much great resolution TRUS therefore , detect change prostate accurately . If conduct prior target biopsy , MRI also reduce number core take compare standard biopsy ( e.g . 2-4 core vs. 12 core ) , could reduce biopsy side effect simultaneously increase detection clinically significant cancer compare routine 12-core biopsy save health care system dollar . Technology combine MRI time biopsy ( MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy ) increasingly use , promise result . However , technique require expensive equipment specially-trained personnel , time-consuming restrictive procedure occur . Utilizing MRI prior TRUS-guided biopsy could provide benefit term cancer detection , reasonable cost short wait-times MRI alone do variety setting time . If result study demonstrate MRI-targeted biopsy improve detection clinically significant cancer TRUS-guided biopsy alone , would suggest protocol may practical solution . Moreover , result show MRI-targeted biopsy could reduce number core take without miss clinically significant cancer , local biopsy protocol could adjust future minimize unnecessary harm population men . In summary , study practical merit minimize cost patient morbidity associate unnecessary prostate biopsy treatment across Canada . The primary objective study determine use MRI improve cancer detection identify potential cancer target prior TRUS-guided biopsy population previous inconclusive result TRUS-guided biopsy . The secondary objective : - Determine sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value MRI predict clinically significant prostate cancer - Identify area prostate would benefit MRI - Estimate Type 1 Type II error use MRI-targeted biopsy sample compare MRI-targeted standard 12-core . - Estimate cost saving use MRI-targeted biopsy sample compare MRI-targeted standard 12-core . - Compare cost-effectiveness use MRI prior TRUS-guided biopsy compare MRI-fusion biopsy use center This prospective , single institution randomize clinical control trial.. Participants randomize 1:1 ratio one follow group : 1 . Control Group : TRUS-guided systematic 12-core biopsy ( standard care ) 2 . Experimental Group : prostate MRI later follow systematic 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy + target biopsy additional MRI-detected core</detailed_description>
