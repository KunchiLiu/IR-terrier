	<brief_summary>This study aim compare efficacy afatinib maintenance pemetrexed maintenance follow induction therapy platinum/ pemetrexed patient metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutate non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) progress first-line treatment afatinib respect progression-free survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maintaining ERBB Blockade EGFR-mutated Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , phase II study maintain pan-ERBB blockade follow platinum-based induction chemotherapy patient EGFR mutate , metastatic NSCLC progress first-line treatment afatinib . Patients progress first-line treatment afatinib screen receive induction phase consist least three four cycle cisplatin/carboplatin plus pemetrexed give 21-day cycle . Patients progress ( i.e . complete partial response , stable disease - CR , PR SD ) completion three four cycle induction chemotherapy randomize ( 1:1 ratio ) receive maintenance therapy either afatinib ( 40 mg/d , last dose reduce first-line treatment ) pemetrexed ( 500 mg/m² every 21 day , 375 mg/m² dose reduce induction therapy ) disease progression , unacceptable toxicity patient consent withdrawal .</detailed_description>
