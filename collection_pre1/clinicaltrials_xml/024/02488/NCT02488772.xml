	<brief_summary>Background The emergency department chaotic place high level noise light 24 hour day . Patients often board overnight await test consultation schedule morning . Sleep deprivation , high noise level associate negative patient experience outcomes clinical setting . Interventions counter effect noise light emergency department patient stay overnight investigate . Objective To determine sleep aspect patient experience improve patient board overnight Emergency Department use sleep mask ear plug . Methods A randomize control study take place Emergency Department Kingston General Hospital . Eligible patient randomize receive either sleep aid ( sleep mask ear plug ) standard treatment ( sleep aid ) . The primary outcome sleep quality , assess Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire . Secondary outcome include patient satisfaction , hour sleep , blood pressure , heart rate , new-onset delirium , patient 's sense feel well-rested patient overall sense well-being . The primary analysis intention-to-treat compare primary secondary outcome two group unadjusted fashion . A secondary analysis involve linear regression explore association treatment group Richards-Campbell Sleep Score , control potential confounders . Importance Determining feasibility efficacy sleep mask earplugs patient emergency department improve sleep patient experience never do . If find effective , relatively low- cost intervention could implement emergency department across country around world .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design This randomize controlled trial . Setting Kingston General Hospital Regional Trauma Tertiary Care Center Kingston , Ontario . The Emergency Department see approximately 56,000 patient annually . It staff Emergency Medicine Physicians , resident FRCP CCFP-EM Emergency Medicine program , well off-service resident . Population This study include convenience sample recruitment weekday research assistance available . Specifically included emergency department patient age ≥18 year , GCS 15 , 2300h deem likely study personnel board Emergency Department least 0700h follow morning wait consultant assessment , investigation , transfer . Excluded patient include previously enrol study involve sleep research within last month , legally blind history hearing impairment , document history cognitive impairment , positive delirium screen enrollment , present complaint head trauma . Also exclude prisoner comprehend English . Outcomes The primary outcome sleep quality measure modify Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire ( RCSQ ) , complete patient termination intervention . Secondary outcome include individual sleep domain Richards Campbell sleep questionnaire ( depth , latency , awakening , percentage time awake , quality sleep ) , patient satisfaction , perceive hour sleep , blood pressure , heart rate , new-onset delirium , change patient 's sense well-rested change patient 's overall sense well-being . Randomization Group allocation randomize night , cluster randomization , effort decrease contamination patient enrol even . All eligible patient screen consented ( see Level 1 Information Sheet Consent ) , primary information ( see Enrollment Questionnaire ) complete prior randomization . A sequential opaque envelope , tin-foil wrap allocation card , open . During treatment night , patient consent intervention ( see Level 2 Information Sheet Consent ) . Sleep aid distribute consent patient ( see Verbal Instructions Enrollment ) . Treatment patient remind disclose allocation last question Completion Questionnaire follow morning . Night randomization randomly permute box 6-10 . A randomization log keep date record log case report form . Patients group inform randomized nature study , nature study group completion data collection . Study procedures consent Patients identify potentially eligible trained research staff 2300h day recruitment . This accomplished examination electronic medical record emergency department discussion treat clinician . Eligibility confirm Eligibility Confirmation prior consent . This study employ two-level consent procedure . This necessary avoid measurement bias patient ultimately randomize control group . Many outcomes subjective , patient randomize control group ( sleep mask earplug ) might prone answer sleep quality patient satisfaction question negatively gain knowledge mask sleep plug available withheld via consent process . Data source data collection Outcome data collect assistance Research Assistant prior termination intervention ( include modified-RCSQ satisfaction VAS ) retrospectively ( vital sign overnight , sedate stimulating medication use nursing record assess via electronic medical record ) . Efforts make blind research staff undertake morning measurement study group . The nighttime treating nurse remove sleep mask ear plug prior leave 0700hrs . Data collection begin 0800hrs allow 1hr washout Emergency Department . The delirium assessment make study staff enrollment termination intervention ( approximately 0700h ) via standardize screening protocol ( Delirium Triage Screen Brief Confusion Assessment Method Han , 2013 ) . `` Nursing interaction '' quantified end study period morning . We define one `` Nursing interaction '' visit patient bedside record electronic medical record ( EDIS ) . Typical intervention include medication delivery , vital sign assessment , respond call bell . For example , two medication offer count single intervention . Should patient leave Emergency Department prior collect outcome data , research staff member mail paper-based questionnaire patient . This follow telephone patient week 3 week information return . Emergency Department description : similar study , serial decibel measurement make section emergency department five night . Each section represent mean dB read peak value . Similar measurement light intensity make . This provide comparison section analysis . Statistical Methods Analysis plan Baseline characteristic summarize descriptive statistic ( e.g . mean/SD continuous variable , count/percent categorical ) . The primary analysis intension-to-treat analysis . The primary analysis unadjusted patient environmental characteristic . Mean Richards-Campbell Sleep Score compare treatment group use mixed effect model . Patient environmental characteristic compare group descriptive statistic . These characteristic include age , gender , pain ( record visual analogue scale ) , emergency department location ( section A , B , C , D , E ) , presence companion room , light condition ( light on/off ) , private room versus multi-patient area versus hallway/non patient area placement , day week use sedative , home sleep quality , chronic use medication sleep aid home . A sensitivity analysis employ linear regression use explore association treatment group Richards-Campbell Sleep Score control potential confounders . Secondary analysis include per-protocol analysis include patient actually use ear plug sleep mask &gt; 3 hour . Power calculation Power calculation complete use mean RCSQ score previous work do ICU patient ( data available patient emergency department ) . The mean score patient population 57 +/- 28 . For two-sided alpha=0.05 power 80 % detect 20 % difference mean RCSQ group need 96 patient group . Because cluster analysis increase 150 patient group account possible loss power . Recruitment timeline This study register clinicaltrials.gov prior participant enrolment . From informal review KGH ED patient census anticipate approximately 7 people wait morning image CCAC referral could assess eligibility . Making conservative estimate 4 eligible consent patient complete study per recruit day , 75 recruiting day require . Given convenience sample recruitment weekday , recruitment phase study require 15 week .</detailed_description>
