	<brief_summary>Small bowel ultrasound ( SBUS ) emerge well tolerate , non-invasive , radiation free , low cost measure assess inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , use first-line image Europe . SBUS finding show correlate endoscopic finding , small number recent study look change bowel wall thickness ( BWT ) response anti-tumor necrosis factor ( anti-TNF ) therapy . However , use SBUS detect response anti-TNF therapy test pediatric patient . The purpose study apply use SBUS pediatric patient Crohn 's disease ass response treatment infliximab . The investigator also measure C-reactive protein fecal calprotectin baseline , additionally measure IFX level anti-infliximab antibody ( ATI ) week 14 ass change biochemical response infliximab treatment , well correlation marker change patient report outcome via weighted pediatric Crohn 's disease activity questionnaire ( wPCDAI ) change BWT . This study novel first study pediatric patient use SBUS ass response IFX therapy , also first study correlate SBUS finding therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) . This study potential propagate use SBUS pediatric population , use TDM concert small bowel image post-induction allow investigator tailor therapy early treatment course .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Small Bowel Ultrasound Predict Response Remicade Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) patient increase risk high ionize radiation exposure assessment condition . Small bowel ultrasound ( SBUS ) emerge well tolerate , non-invasive , radiation free , low cost measure assess inflammatory bowel disease , use first-line image Europe . SBUS finding show correlate endoscopic finding , small number recent study look change bowel wall thickness ( BWT ) , response anti-TNF therapy . The use SBUS detect response anti-TNF therapy test pediatric patient . In addition , study frequently use Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) measure clinical activity , yet know multiple study include SONIC trial CDAI reliable accurate measure predict mucosal heal . A weighted PCDAI use instead , show perform well original PCDAI feasible , especially consider study span 14 week score item height velocity full PCDAI irrelevant . The goal study measure bowel wall thickness ( BWT ) prior initiate infliximab ( IFX 0 ) week 14 look correlation change BWT ( delta BWT ) change clinical disease activity ( delta wPCDAI ) two time point . The research team measure fecal calprotectin baseline week 14 stool collect day prior visit use specimen collection kit give subject . The research team also collect result routine laboratory ( include C-Reactive Protein , Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate , Complete Blood Count , Albumin ) do infusion , IFX level anti-infliximab antibody ( ATI ) week 14 ass change biochemical response infliximab treatment , well correlation marker change patient report outcome ( via wPCDAI questionnaire ) change BWT .</detailed_description>
