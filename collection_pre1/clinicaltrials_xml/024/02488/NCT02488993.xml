	<detailed_description>Whilst clinical trial data small observational study demonstrate potential rifaximin-α 550 mg reduce overt HE episodes hospitalization , need physician , commissioner healthcare professional care patient HE understand impact management rifaximin-α 550 mg healthcare resource use real world clinical practice . Currently available data evaluation undertake single UK centre . In addition , overall burden HE well characterize , include impact patient quality life , impaired productivity incur patient ' caregiver . This multinational , multicentre disease registry study aim comprehensively rigorously characterize impact rifaximin-α 550 mg hospitalization , clinical safety effectiveness outcome , quality life patient HE Europe Australasia . The study expand upon previous work follow way : - Provide characterization burden HE impact rifaximin-α 550 mg real world setting , complement RCT evidence ; - Allow rigorous characterization impact rifaximin-α 550 mg patient outcome individual HE time . This achieve prospectively enrol patient take rifaximin-α 550 mg characterize outcomes time absence treatment , assess quality life workplace productivity implication HE . There change management patient purpose study beyond normal clinical practice .</detailed_description>
