	<brief_title>Effects Varenicline Heavy Drinking Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There strong positive association cigarette smoke alcohol use epidemiologic behavioral level . This co-use create substantial impediment smoke cessation . Approximately 25 % current smoker heavy drinker . Alcohol use risk factor relapse smoke cessation associate low odds quit smoking . Smokers five time likely experience smoking lapse drinking episode time . Further , heavy drinking smoker experience health consequence individual either smoker heavy drinker , impairment brain morphology function great risk various cancer . Given high co-occurrence smoke drink health risk associate co-use substance , convincingly argue heavy drinking smoker constitute distinct sub-population smoker unique clinical profile treatment need . Yet , available pharmacological treatment guideline tailor heavy drinking smoker , despite evidence treatment-resistant sub-group . Thus , treatment development heavy drinking smoker represent highly significant understudied research area . Varenicline first-line treatment nicotine dependence may also effective reduce alcohol use . Recent study indicate varenicline reduces pleasurable effect alcohol self-administration laboratory , well alcohol crave consumption clinical trial . These finding suggest varenicline promising medication smoke cessation heavy drinking smoker , reduce alcohol crave consumption may key component effectively reduce smoke prevent relapse sub-group . In early abstinence , one reliable predictor relapse occurrence single smoking lapse , generally define smoke least puff cigarette . As much 95 % smoker experience lapse progress relapse , lead first lapse theorize represent transition abstinence regular smoking . Alcohol consumption one consistently identify risk factor smoke lapse , therefore , may contribute maintenance nicotine dependence heavy drinking smoker . Recent clinical trial laboratory evidence suggest varenicline effective reduce general smoking lapse behavior , although unknown whether effect translate alcohol-mediated smoking lapse behavior . To address important gap literature , human laboratory study use two laboratory paradigm , namely alcohol administration smoking lapse task , examine clinically-relevant effect varenicline among heavy-drinking smoker ( i.e. , individual smoke ≥ 10 cigarettes/day meet National Institute Alcohol Abuse Alcoholism ( NIAAA ) guideline heavy drinking ) . The investigator enroll 22 non-treatment seek heavy drinking smoker randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover laboratory study , test efficacy varenicline reduce smoke behavior control alcohol administration among heavy drinking smoker . All participant daily smoker ( ≥ 10 cig/day ) also heavy drinker accord NIAAA guideline . Interested individual come laboratory in-person screen visit physical exam . Eligible participant randomize medication sequence , varenicline ( 1 mg twice daily ) placebo . Medication titrate 12-day period within medication condition participant complete two laboratory session day 9 12 . The laboratory session consist placebo-controlled alcohol administration follow McKee smoke lapse task . After complete laboratory session first medication condition , seven-day wash-out period , participant begin second medication condition complete laboratory session day 9 12 titration period ( i.e. , participant complete four laboratory session experience four combination varenicline/placebo pill alcohol/placebo beverage ) . In laboratory session , participant receive dose alcohol [ target breath alcohol concentration ( BrAC ) = 0.08 g/dl ] placebo beverage , randomize double-blind fashion , complete smoking lapse task . In paradigm , participant present preferred brand cigarette , lighter , ashtray . Participants inform begin cigarette self-administration session delay smoke exchange fixed amount monetary reinforcement . If participant decides smoke , begin self-administration session give choice smoke prefer brand cigarette receive fix monetary reinforcement cigarette smoke . In addition smoking outcome , measure crave , mood , subjective effect administer baseline , alcohol administration , lapse paradigm . The study design allow within-subjects comparison effect varenicline ( versus placebo ) , alcohol ( versus placebo ) , interaction smoking behavior laboratory . The Specific Aims project proposal : Aim 1 : To test whether varenicline effective reduce alcohol cigarette craving , well reduce acute subjective effect alcohol cigarette ; Aim 2 : To test whether varenicline effective mitigating alcohol 's effect smoke lapse behavior ; Aim 3 : To test whether acute subjective response alcohol predictive subsequent smoking lapse behavior examine varenicline reduces effect . The investigator hypothesize varenicline , compare placebo , reduce cigarette alcohol craving , attenuate subjective response alcohol cigarette smoking , improve performance smoking lapse task increase participant 's ability resist smoking . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize varenicline 's ability reduce alcohol crave subjective response acute dose alcohol directly predictive performance smoking lapse task . Since heavy drinking smoker show relatively treatment-resistant , result current study could sizable implication support varenicline potential tailor treatment sizable at-risk sub-group .</detailed_description>
