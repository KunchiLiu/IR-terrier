	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study gallium-68 ( 68Ga ) -prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) ( gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA ligand Glu-urea-Lys [ Ahx ] ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) PET/magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) identify tumor patient prostate cancer come back period improvement ( recurrent ) . 68Ga-PSMA radioactive drug may attach specific prostate cancer cell light . Scanners , PET/CT PET/MRI , use take picture body see cancer . Using 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT PET/MRI may allow doctor identify small tumor standard method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>68Ga-PSMA PET/CT PET/MRI Evaluating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : Evaluate feasibility biodistribution 68Ga-PSMA . OUTLINE : Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA ligand Glu-urea-Lys ( Ahx ) intravenously ( IV ) undergo PET/CT PET/MRI approximately 45 60 minute later . After completion study , patient follow 24 hour 1 week .</detailed_description>
