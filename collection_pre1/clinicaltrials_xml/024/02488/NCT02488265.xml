	<brief_summary>Postural instability particularly incapacitating disorder , loss motor independence Parkinson´s Disease ( PD ) patient mark significant stage disease onset . Evidence suggest deficit automatic motor control , sensory integration attention associate lack balance PD . Physiotherapy , together medication , play important role treatment state , although consensus reach best treatment modality . The aim randomize control trial protocol evaluate effect balance training rhythmical ( BRT ) , motor program improve balance associate rhythmical auditory cue ( RACs )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol : Balance Training Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 150 PD patient H &amp; Y stag II-III asymptomatic depression dementia enrol single-blind randomized study . Randomization achieve via computer-generated random-sequence table . All patient also present fall history.They assign one three group , balance gait assess 10 training session , 4 30 week subsequent end training . Balance assess BERG Test ( BBS ) Postural Stress Test ( PST ) . Gait evaluate Timed Up Go test ( TUG ) . Independence Activities Daily Living ( ADLs ) ass interview ; UPDRS , motor performance . The BRT group receive motor program improve balance associate RACs , MT group perform motor training aim BRT group without RACs , control group ( CG ) train orientation . The exercise program specific balance 5 week ' duration two session per week , 45 minute , consist general physiotherapy exercise . Each session divide five warm-up minutes—30 minute main part 10 minute cool . The training progress intensifies week depend individual 's performance . The subject able execute 10 repetition exercise sequence correctly progress next movement . The training progress increase intensity week . On first week , training , exercise explain demonstrated physiotherapist , demand special attention difficult aspect movement execution . The subject perform 05 repetition ( 5 RM ) exercise . On first phase patient may present mistake might need specific information correct movement execution . The exercise repeat next session order consolidate learning . The subject must capable associate correction exercise proposs first week . In group repetition , group , physiotherapist use verbal command movement change , anticipate request attention difficult one . Only GBRT orient focus rhythmical auditory cue . On second week , subject perform series 10 repetition ( 10 RM ) third week , 2 series 10 repetition ( 20RM ) . On fourth week , subject must able execute 20RM exercise sequence increase speed .</detailed_description>
