	<brief_summary>Arterial stiffen endothelial dysfunction correlate advance age contribute decline cardioprotection age . Arterial stiffness endothelial dysfunction emerge risk factor cardiovascular disease predict future cardiac event . Vascular function long target lifestyle intervention several study show improvement traditional exercise mode . However , impact yoga vascular function remain elusive . This study determine effect 12-week Bikram yoga intervention arterial stiffness endothelial function healthy , middle-aged adult . The overall aim study determine efficacy Bikram yoga improve vascular endothelial function arterial distensibility middle-aged adult risk factor coronary artery disease determine whether heated environment play role mediate alteration vascular function . The investigator propose conduct 12-week Bikram yoga intervention study sedentary individual order test follow hypothesis : 1 . Bikram yoga elicit reduction arterial stiffness enhancement endothelial function sedentary , middle-aged adult . 2 . The postulated effect Bikram yoga great practice heat environment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bikram yoga trademark form yoga series 26 yoga posture perform heat ( 41ºC ) , humidify environment 90-minute period . Bikram yoga rapidly gain popularity approximately 300 studio currently operate U.S . The 90-minute session consist pranayama ( breathe ) , stand , balance , strengthen , stretch asana ( posture ) perform sauna-like environment . Although highly control style yoga provide optimal choice interventional research study , study attempt elucidate health benefit associate Bikram yoga . Subjects randomly assign one three group : heat Bikram yoga ( 41ºC ) , room temperature Bikram yoga ( 22ºC ) , control participant instruct alter physical activity pattern . Collected data interventional study analyze ANOVA and/or ANCOVA repeat measure . Pearson correlation coefficient use examine association variable interest . A significance level p &lt; 0.05 employ determine statistical significance . A total 80 sedentary ( &lt; 2 day physical activity weekly ) male female adult age 40 60 year recruit studied . Twenty subject group complete 12 week Bikram yoga room temperature ( 22ºC ) , Bikram yoga heat environment ( 41ºC ) , control period participant instructed alter physical activity level . Based previous study compete investigator employ Bikram yoga intervention , dropout rate 25 % anticipate . Therefore , goal investigator minimum 60 subject ( 20 per group ) complete 12-week intervention , investigator recruit enroll 80 subject . Once participant report laboratory , height weight measure finger prick perform . Body composition measure via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan . Endothelial function measure non-invasively via flow-mediated dilation . This technique involve ultrasound image upper arm obtain image brachial artery . Once baseline image acquire , cuff place around forearm inflate 5 minute . More image acquire cuff deflate image analyze determine percent change arterial diameter baseline . Arterial stiffness measure use pulse wave velocity . Tonometric sensor place carotid femoral pulse sit blood pressure cuff place arm ankle determine brachial tibial arterial blood pressure . The distance carotid femoral pulse site measure pulse wave velocity determine distance travel divided time initiation carotid femoral pulse .</detailed_description>
