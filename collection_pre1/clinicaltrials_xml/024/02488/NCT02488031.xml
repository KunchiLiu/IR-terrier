	<detailed_description>Thirty individual diagnose either Spinocerebellar Ataxia - 1 ( SCA1 ) , Spinocerebellar Ataxia - 3 ( SCA3 ) , Spinocerebellar Ataxia - 6 ( SCA6 ) recruit study . Participants randomly assign best medical management ( BMM / control ) group error-reduction group . All participant visit lab twice test one month apart . Participants control group train pre- post-test time . The error-reduction intervention 4-week home-based program . Investigators use novel , custom design computer interface . Participants perform goal-directed movement leg target 3D virtual environment design emphasize accurate movement . The goal-directed leg movement ( similar leg press ) perform seated require hip , knee , ankle joint control . Leg movement detect use LeapMotion sensor ( Leap Motion Inc. San Francisco , CA ) , device support hand , finger / tool motion input , similar mouse , require contact . Spatial endpoint error quantify 3D space compare endpoint location foot trajectory ( extend big toe ) virtual location target . Time endpoint error quantify compare time foot trajectory require time target . The length intervention 4 week . Each participant train 4 day week ~1 hour per day . Within week task difficulty increase change presentation target predictable unpredictable location , increase movement speed requirement change target size . Targets make predictable identifying prior cue movement onset ( target turn green ) . Specifically , flash dotted line around target prior target turn green . Targets make unpredictable providing indication target location prior target turn green . Movement speed quantify voluntary movement onset leg ( reaction time ) movement end.The movement speed requirement increase within week participant learn execute fast movement feedback trial . The size target progressively reduce 4 week . All individual study receive pre- post-test assessment use International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale ( ICARS ) Scale Assessment Rating Ataxia ( SARA ) . The individual section ICARS ( e.g . Kinetic section ) SARA quantify . In addition , leg dysmetria quantify use custom-made goal-directed movement protocol . Specifically , participant perform unloaded ankle dorsiflexion movement attempt reach space-time target . The primary outcome position time error . Biomechanics overground walk SCA monitor use APDM mobility lab ( APDM , Inc. Mobility Lab , Oregon , USA ) . Participants wear APDM 's wireless sensor hand , leg , trunk forehead walk overground distance 7 meter 2 minute . APDM quantify 80 common biomechanical outcome gait ( e.g . stride length variability ) . The neurophysiology SCA quantify functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) motor unit pool activity . Brain activity quantify task-based fMRI use 32-channel head coil . During fMRI force task , ankle dorsiflexion measure affected low limb use customized fiber optic sensor , do past . Real-time feedback force performance provide subject . During rest block , subject fixate stationary target produce force . During task block , subject complete 2 second pulse-hold contraction 15 % maximum voluntary contraction ( MVC ) ankle dorsiflexion follow 1 second rest . There 10 pulse per block . The knee support pillow flex knee force apply ankle cause head movement .</detailed_description>
