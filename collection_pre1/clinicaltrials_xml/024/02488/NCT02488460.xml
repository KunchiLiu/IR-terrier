	<brief_summary>Background Increased physical activity improve cognition academic skill . However due economic concern increase focus standardize testing , PA school often receive little attention physical education reduce many country favor spending time devote academic class . This tendency compatible increase evidence association physical activity , fitness , cognitive academic performance . Despite increase evidence association PA , fitness , cognitive academic performance , longitudinal high-quality study exist examine effect physical activity academic performance ( ref. ) . Furthermore , best knowledge two study assess academic outcome follow integration physical activity classroom intervention participant score significantly high test section compare control make generalize result challenge . To promote policy change require physical activity school , empirical data need study effect school-based physical activity program . Therefore investigator carry cluster randomize control trial conduct examine effect math achievement executive function classroom base PA math .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Physical Activity Math - RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design Twelve elementary school cluster randomize active math intervention serve control . Randomization perform shuffle seal envelope intervention allocation inside determine group assignment . This happen meeting leader school , employee municipality responsible researcher present . The study last school year ( 43 week ) subject test nine-month long intervention . All test perform within one week except objective measurement physical activity ( PA ) via accelerometer ( ActiGraph , 7163 , Pensacola , FL ) , take place separate week , baseline endline . In intervention period ( 38 week ) participant receive average 6 mathematics lesson 45 minute per week respectively physically active traditional teaching . The intervention The intervention consist math teach focus implement PA classroom facilitate instrument . Teachers tell include least 15 minute physical activity 45 minute math lesson . In addition sedentary activity allow last maximum 20 minute . Classroom-based PA aim create meaningful bind mathematical concept specific physical activity improve mental representation mathematics thus contribute understand memory mathematical concept . Classroom teacher train implementation intervention Training provide math teacher intervention school course give responsible group researcher . The training plan collaboration mathematics teacher intervention school responsible group researcher base curriculum mathematics Danish public school . The planning teaching content take place 4-day mandatory course mathematics teacher purpose enable teacher teach active mathematics thereby promote math achievement . As part course teacher receive folder suggestion PA math make responsible group researcher . In addition developed activity specific instruction inspiration teacher could incorporate PA element academic instruction . Since teacher 's motivation involvement influence outcome study , emphasis place create high motivation course increase understanding numerous positive cognitive effect PA .</detailed_description>
