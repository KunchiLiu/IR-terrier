	<brief_title>Medical Management Late Intrauterine Death .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , randomised , double-blind , control clinical trial ( RCT ) conduct compare efficacy clinical safety induction labour use combination isosorbide dinitrate-oxytocin ( experimental arm , X = 1 ) compare misoprostol-oxytocin ( standard arm , X = 0 ) . The main result study success rate foetal expulsion within 15 hour , average administration induction interval define secondary result . A total 60 woman pregnancy great 20 week gestation refer foetal evacuation . We define late intrauterine foetal death ( IUFD ) baby without sign life uterus 20 complete week pregnancy . The approval conduct study obtain institutional board ethical committee hospital . All participant inform objective study , inform consent require . Patients follow characteristic include : close cervix without evidence cervical dilation baseline uterine activity , A Bishop score &lt; 5 , intact membrane , gestation great equal 20 week establish date menstruation fetometry ultrasound-confirmed late IUFD . This study include medical management multiple pregnancy , IUFD late foeticide management specific medical condition associate increase risk IUFD patient history hypertension , along woman history unexplained antepartum haemorrhage , pelvic dystocia another counter-indications medication use . Patients assign computational random number generator receive isosorbide dinitrate misoprostol . Allocation group predetermine arranged numerical order . All participant give vaginal exam person , blind treatment allocation . The medication administer posterior fornix , cervical activity evaluate baseline every 3 hour monitor change base Bishop score . If cervical condition change treatment application , participant receive new dose , without exceed 4 dos , facilitate cervical ripening . Once Bishop score 7 reach , oxytocin infuse balance electrolyte solution begin infusion rate 2 milli-International Units per minute ( mIU/min ) double dose every 15 minute . The labour induction time first application medication expulsion foetus determine digital stopwatch . Each woman 's vital sign verify determine stable condition demonstrate haemodynamic stability requirement application new dose . During time , data medical information collect paper later enter computational database . The participant remain rest evaluation adverse effect , headache , abdominal pain , pelvic pain , low back pain , nausea , dizziness , vomit . The lack cervical activity 4 dos medication consider treatment failure . A base solution isosorbide dinitrate misoprostol prepare obtain concentration 20 microgram per milliliter ( mcg/mL ) 10 % lactose solution . Serial dilution perform use know concentration mobile phase buffer solution ( 150 g ammonium acetate 11.5 mL glacial acetic acid 1 L water ) , methanol water proportion 350:100:550 , respectively . The concentration drug determine use ultraviolet ( UV ) light spectrophotometer reading lambda 220 nm reference filter lambda 278 nm . The mean absorbance set standard , control sample calculate standard plot curve . Computer-based curve-fitting statistical software employ . Peak absorption area curve take account determine stability pharmacological integration . Known sample isosorbide dinitrate misoprostol add 100 % glycerin prepare gel solution . The reagent final concentration either 80 mg isosorbide dinitrate 1.5 ml gel solution 100 microgram misoprostol presentation . Both solution pack syrinx appearance purpose keep physician , patient researcher blind . The pharmacist participant know content syrinx . Four syrinx place opaque seal envelope consecutively number unique study number . The envelope open physician applied content syringe , repeat administration every 3 hour accord prior selection random allocation patient . The entire `` stock '' reagent remain stable period 20 day maintain room temperature ( 18-25° C ) use . The calculation sample size base Cox regression model use risk quotient ( log Hazard Ratio ) 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) .17 To reach power ( superiority clinical trial ) 80 % α value 0.05 , standard deviation 0.5 assumption 25 % woman fail induce labour , estimate sample size require trial 60 patient ( 30 arm ) . All continuous variable summarise use histograms measure central tendency conduct statistical analysis . The statistical analysis perform use Chi-Square test , Fisher 's exact test Mantel-Haenszel test , Student 's test appropriate . The Shapiro-Wilk test use verify normality data . To model time-event labour induction IUFD , Cox regression utilise , control covariates maternal age , foetal size weight , week gestation . The proportional hazard assumption evaluate use two graphed line , correspond survival curve ( absence cross ) log-log plots figure . Respiratory cardiac rate , temperature ( measure orally ) systolic diastolic blood pressure ( record use sphygmomanometry ) determine baseline every 3 hour trial end . Relative risk ( RRs ) 95 % CIs estimate utilising bivariate analysis , include non-serious adverse event among treatment group . Attributable risk calculate determine probability total risk adverse effect observe use isosorbide dinitrate misoprostol . All test two-tailed , result value p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
