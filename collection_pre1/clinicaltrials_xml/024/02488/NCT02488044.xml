This study design evaluate safety tolerability IV administration AEB1102 treatment pediatric adult patient Arginase I deficiency hyperargininemia . This study conduct 2 part : Part 1 ( Single Ascending Dose Escalation ) Part 2 ( Repeated Dosing ) . Each part precede baseline assessment arginine level . All patient participate Part 1 may continue AEB1102 dose Part 2 qualify continue dose . A data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) provide independent review study safety data recommend whether sponsor continue study plan , modify study protocol , discontinue study .</brief_summary>
