	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) represent leading cause disability worldwide , knee commonly affect joint . Knee OA traditionally attribute peripheral mechanism , peripheral damage , inflammation , psychological factor fail significantly account presence , absence , severity chronic OA-related pain . Recent study show individual OA-related pain exhibit dysfunctional pain modulation support significant central nervous system ( CNS ) contribution . However , CNS mechanisms underlying change pain modulation currently know , relation clinical pain progression . The propose pilot examines brain circuit recently describe predict transition acute chronic pain , predict clinical experimental pain change well physical performance mobility change older person knee OA pain one year period . The finding provide novel important information regard mechanism underlie aberrant pain process functional consequence old adult knee OA . The information learn subsequently use target treatment prevention strategy future study older adult . The central hypothesis increase functional structural connectivity cortico-striatal region significantly associate baseline clinical experimental pain decrease physical function person symptomatic knee OA account rapid clinical pain disability progression overtime .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lifetime risk develop symptomatic knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) exceed 40 % , OA prevalence rise due increase age obesity U.S. population . Historically , OA conceptualize regional pain condition whose symptom driven peripheral pathophysiology . However , poor correspondence measure disease severity clinical symptom suggest factor beyond peripheral tissue damage must contribute OA-related pain . Recent study demonstrate generalize alteration pain processing among individual OA . However , investigator date examine brain circuit focus proposal patient symptomatic knee OA . An improved understanding mechanism underlie OA-related change pain modulation provide basis development target preventive rehabilitative strategy . In light evidence emphasize plasticity white matter connection , potential pain relieve effect non-invasive brain stimulation intervention , seem reasonable identify connection potential target future treatment approach . Given expected growth old population , strategy could monumental impact reduce healthcare expenditure improve quality life old adult .</detailed_description>
