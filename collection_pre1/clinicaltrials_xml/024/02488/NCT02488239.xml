	<detailed_description>Prospective , non-randomized , multi-center , single group , post market clinical study The device fully commercially available subject plan receive CRT-P implant part standard care ( SOC ) . The assignment specific Ingenio 2 device physician 's choice consider lead currently place previous device plan new lead ( e.g. , Acuity X4 and/or LV lead ) . Enrollment Consenting Clinic Visit ( ≤ 30 day prior implant procedure ) ( require ) - Implant Procedure ( Day 0 ; future follow ups base date ) ( require ) - Pre-Discharge Clinic Visit ( pocket closure wound coverage 0-5 day post-implant procedure ) ( require ) - 1 month post-implant Clinic Visit ( 30 ± 15 day ) ( require ) - 3 month post-implant Clinic Visit ( 91 ± 21 day ) ( require ) - Latitude-based Close-out ( 91 - 120 day month post last enrollment ) ( report require ) - Unscheduled clinic follow-up ( clinic visit pre-discharge 3 month follow addition 1 month follow ; per center SOC subject need ; event reporting ) - Re-implant/Revision ( need ) - During trial unanticipated serious adverse device effect ( USADEs ) , serious adverse device effect ( SADEs ) , adverse device effect ( ADEs ) , DDs , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , death , change device system must report ( enrollment Closeout ) . Study Duration Enrollment expect take 12 month . The study consider complete ( primary endpoint completion ) subject complete Latitude base close-out 3-4 month last study enrollment . All study require visit complete part regularly schedule clinic visit .</detailed_description>
