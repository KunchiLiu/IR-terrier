	<brief_summary>Phantom limb pain ( PLP ) frequent consequence amputation , notoriously difficult treat . Amputation usually follow traumatic injury surgery follow vascular disease , diabetes , osteomyelitis tumour case loss limb require survival patient . The loss limb body part usually follow sensation lose body part still present felt . These phenomenon call , respectively , phantom awareness phantom sensation . In 50-80 % amputee neuropathic pain develop lose limb also refer phantom limb pain ( PLP ) . PLP relate certain position movement phantom limb , might elicit worsened range physical factor ( e.g . change weather pressure residual limb ) psychological factor ( e.g . emotional stress ) . It well known treatment available PLP today , pharmacological , surgical , anaesthetic , psychological , ineffective . Today believe phantom limb pain may relate change cortex brain . There evidence change may modulate - even reverse - provide sensory input stump amputation zone . For example , cortical reorganization alleviation phantom limb pain observe amputee follow intense use hand prosthesis . However , consistent knowledge type peripheral sensory feedback may effective affect cortical plasticity best apply sensory feedback . The aim propose research create natural , meaningful sensation provide non-invasive sensory feedback ( i.e . surface electrical stimulation ) effectiveness alleviate phantom limb pain restore cortical neuroplastic change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose experiment Up 50-80 % person amputation experience pain part body miss . This phenomenon call phantom limb pain . It clear today phantom limb pain occur , since pain difficult treat , affect quality life . Other scientific study show , use electrical stimulation apply surface electrode , assist decrease alleviate phantom limb pain . The aim study investigate daily surface electrical stimulation period 30 day decrease alleviate phantom limb pain . Methods Before study begin , necessary test participant tolerate electrical stimulation participant fulfill criterion participate study . During study , different electrical stimulation sequence apply . The participant ask fill series questionnaire , electrical stimulation , describe electrical stimulation experience , stimulation effect phantom limb pain phantom sensation . The participant also ask general mood investigate effect pain . The brain signal participant brain signal measure twice either surface electrode scan technique , participant think move amputate arm/hand leg , move healthy arm/leg , receive electrical stimulation . Plan experiment The experiment take place period three month consist series measurement intervention session plan five phase . All session take place Aalborg University , Denmark except day brain signal measure use scan technique , take place Aalborg University Hospital , Denmark . Phase 1 . Interview meeting subject ( experiment begin , 1 session , 1-2 hour ) . Before experiment begin , participant invite meeting interview project responsible inform participant experiment . Phase 2 . Preliminary investigation ( 1 session maximum 3 hour experiment start ) . Before experiment start , participant sign informed consent , investigator test participant tolerate electrical stimulation . If criteria participation fulfil , participation subject decide . Phase 3 . Baseline measurement ( day 1-27 , 2 weekly session , maximum 3 hour session ) . Before repeat , electrical stimulation session begin , series baseline measurement perform . In phase sensory threshold ( i.e. , level electrical stimulation feel ) measure , electrical stimulation parameter determine . The brain signal participant measure scanning technique ( so-called functional magnetic resonance image fMRI ) surface electrode place oh scalp ( so-called electroencephalographic recording EEG ) . On day brain signal measure session may last 5 hour . Phase 4 . Intervention period ( day 28-56 , 2-5 weekly session , maximum 3 hour session ) . In session , electrical stimulation apply surface electrode place upper arm/the stump leg . The participant ask fill series questionnaire report phantom limb pain , phantom sensation ( i.e. , non-painful sensation ) general mood . Again participant 's brain signal measure use scan surface electrode technique . On day brain signal measure session may last 5 hour . Phase 5 . Follow-up ( day 57-112 , 4 weekly session 8 week maximum 3 hour ) . To measure effect duration intervention participant ask fill series questionnaire . Risks , side effect disadvantage Surface stimulation may cause muscle-contractions . Attachment surface electrode may cause skin become red irritated hour follow experiment . The type electrical stimulation use experiment associate known risk side effect . When sensory threshold determine ( i.e. , low strength electrical stimulation participant feel ) , may feel unpleasant painful short period time , unpleasantness pain disappear soon electrical stimulation stop . The electrical stimulation apply intervention period adjust painful . Measurement brain signal use fMRI-technique ( scan ) safe , known risk side effect procedure . The participant may , however , find placed inside scanner unpleasant . Measurement brain signal surface electrode also consider safe , known risk side effect procedure . There may risk associated experiment unknown investigator . Therefore , participant ask inform investigator participant experience health problem experiment . If investigator discover side effect , participant inform immediately . Benefits experiment There benefit subject participation study . However , participant may find his/her phantom limb pain alleviate experiment result electrical stimulation . However , possible investigator predict electrical stimulation affect phantom limb pain , effect start , large effect , long effect last . It possible offer participant permanent lasting solution termination study . Exclusion suspension experiment If participant , accord assessment investigator , react unexpectedly procedures way suitable continue experiment , participation experiment terminate time . In general , experiment terminate turn subject general tolerate procedure project find experiment exhausting .</detailed_description>
