	<detailed_description>This study initiate highly novel line research use adaptive , gaze-contingent , eye-tracking technology help infant child high risk ASD learn direct attention people action typical fashion . This study begin Normative Collection phase , conclude Gaze-Shaping phase . In Normative Collection phase , investigator examine gaze behavior group typically develop infant child typical development ( TD ) , order establish normative gaze pattern . In Gaze-Shaping phase , within video show Normative Collection phase , investigator highlight selectively targeted people , object , activity , attempt shape participant ' view pattern match normative gaze pattern . Manual cod live-action interaction probe provide additional evaluative measure , allow investigator track real-world ( live-action ) correlate alongside video-eye-tracking behavior . In addition , live-action probe may allow investigator check generalization live interaction another person ( oppose gaze behavior watch video ) . In live-action probe , one two clinical research staff member ( ) interact participant ( front participant ) , manner analogous action perform train video .</detailed_description>
