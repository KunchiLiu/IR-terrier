	<brief_summary>Rationale : An anatomical surgical resection consider standard care fit patient present early stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , surgery less frequently perform elderly patient ( age ≥75 year ) , represent fastest-growing group patient stage I/II NSCLC , patient significant co-morbidity . Following introduction stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) , outpatient treatment typically deliver 3-8 fraction , median survival elderly patient undergo radiotherapy The Netherlands increase 9.3 month . Randomized trial compare SABR surgery yet complete result ongoing ACOSOG Z4032 study available within 5 year . A recent data retrospective study compare modality raise interesting question impact local therapy recurrence pattern . It find well loco-regional disease control rate achieve SABR . Objective : To study effect surgery SABR immunostimulatory ( primary endpoint CD8 positive cell ) immunosuppressive cell peripheral blood patient early stage non-small cell lung cancer treat either modality . Study population : 40 patient cT1-2aN0M0 either cytologically histologically proven NSCLC . Main study parameters/endpoints : To determine whether increase CD8 activity establish SABR patient early stage lung cancer compare increase patient undergoing surgical intervention . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Only risk participation risk draw blood . Subjects benefit . This pilot study use generate information concern treatment useful decision plan future study large series patient .</brief_summary>
