	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery efficient induce adequate weight loss control glycemia obese patient affect Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) . Despite grow evidence suggest early performance bariatric surgery obese patient T2DM offer best opportunity reach maintain remission diabetes , randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) evaluate efficiency patient new T2DM diagnosis . The aim RCT compare bariatric surgery , particular Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy ( LSG ) , conventional medical therapy ( CMT ) patient new T2DM diagnosis obese ( Body Mass Index , BMI 30 42 Kg/m2 ) , recruit two Italian diabetology centre ( Terni Rome ) . The main objective present RCT investigate efficacy LSG compare CMT induce maintain resolution T2DM ( define HbA1c level ≤6.0 % , without active pharmacologic therapy ongoing procedure ) remission T2DM evaluation criterion provide American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) maximum follow-up 6 year . The effect two treatment term weight loss quality life patient also take consideration . Any positive result study include prevent microvascular macrovascular complication connect diabetes , without necessity take medication , time loss excess body weight improved quality life ( QOL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Sleeve Gastrectomy In New Onset Diabetic Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent evidence suggest , obese patient type 2 diabetes mellitus long duration , / poorly control conventional therapy , bariatric surgery promise diabetes remission rate significantly higher attainable traditional treatment , irrespective initial BMI loss body weight patient . This ensure grow conviction international scientific community bariatric surgery consider alternative conventional obesity diabetes therapy failure traditional treatment , perform intent prevent complication associate disease , therefore onset [ 23 ] . Furthermore , use BMI main parameter guide indication bariatric surgery increasingly call question regard presence comorbidities diabetes , distribution obesity , together presence comorbidities diabetes , rather degree obesity predicts onset related complication . Bariatric surgery currently regard `` last resort '' treatment obesity associate comorbidities , diabetes , particularly patient BMI ≤ 35 . Despite , apparent initial BMI body weight loss result bariatric surgery connection metabolic effect procedure , treatment diabetes . In fact , accord current national international guideline ( base consensus dated 1991 [ 6 ] ) , bariatric surgery may consider diabetic patient , BMI 30 39.9 Kg/m2 , record failure conventional medical therapy obesity diabetes . This wait-and-see policy due fact bariatric surgery surgical procedure associate , depend procedure , certain rate short long term potential adverse event , short-medium term show achieve significantly high rate remission diabetes , compare medical therapy , remain uncertainties durability remission diabetes weight control long follow-up period . Essentially , therefore , risk-benefit ratio allow use bariatric surgery first-line therapy treatment type 2 diabetes obese patient , particular class 1 2 obesity . It hypothesize , however , performance LSG diagnosis diabetes obese patient dramatically improve resolution/remission rate duration resolution/remission diabetes , thus improve protection development vascular complication . In fact , grow evidence suggest period time diagnosis diabetes bariatric surgery determine factor achievement duration diabetes remission . It also observe bariatric surgery effective medical therapy prevent diabetes obese patient . In opinion author , early performance LSG , also diagnosis diabetes , could crucial . This hypothesize also basis well-known phenomenon `` glycemic legacy '' , accord great time elapse diabetes diagnosis achievement , form therapy , glycemic control target , low benefit term protection development vascular complication associate diabetes [ 34 ] . It follow blood glucose control patient newly diagnose diabetes achieve implementation appropriate treatment , include bariatric surgery , quickly possible diagnosis . In sense , bariatric surgery ( particular , LSG ) proven capable promote glycemic control short medium term , term substantial rapid reduction glycated haemoglobin , ( even 3 month surgery ) , compare conventional medical therapy patient longstanding diabetes ( 9 year average ) . In RCT conduct Schauer et al. , 3 month sleeve gastrectomy , average HbA1c level reduce initial average value 9.5 % 7 % , medical-therapy group reduce initial value 8.9 % 7.7 % , therefore significantly less effective LSG . Thus irrespective rate achievement duration eventual remission diabetes ( case already present considerably high medical therapy patient longstanding poorly control diabetes ) , patient undergo sleeve gastrectomy ( bariatric surgery general ) could benefit procedure perform diagnosis diabetes , therefore soon possible , thanks ability reach HbA1c target level glycemic control easily quickly medical therapy . This would prove protective effect long-term vascular complication , irrespective duration glycemic control achievement remission basis concept `` glycemic legacy '' `` metabolic memory '' , analysis result large prestigious international randomize clinical trial treatment diabetes ( UKPDS , DCCT/EDIC , ACCORD VATD trial ) . The phenomenon metabolic memory refers fact UKPDS DCCT / EDIC study demonstrate even transitory period aggressive glycemic control , attainable bariatric surgery , capable induce beneficial `` metabolic memory '' , effect reduce microvascular complication time , regardless subsequent maintenance glycemic control [ 32 ] . Then rationale use bariatric surgery diagnosis type 2 diabetes mellitus base hypothesis attainment early sustain glycemic control obese patient , also variety scientific evidence suggest precocity performance positive predictor remission long-term maintenance diabetes remission . As previously mention , superiority bariatric surgery conventional medical therapy obese patient ( even BMI le 30 ) diabetes long duration , / poorly control conventional therapy , term attain glycemic control , clearly demonstrate , even medium-short follow-up period [ 1 ] . When applied obese patient new onset diabetes might therefore subvert risk-benefit ratio prevents use first-line therapy , thanks increase rate remission diabetes endurance , well reduction long-term vascular complication diabetes . In conclusion , recent American Society Metabolic Bariatric Surgery ( ASMBS ) position statement note class 1 obesity require effective treatment , represent significant health problem , treatment involve use bariatric surgery . Indeed , recent randomize study demonstrate effectiveness , term weight loss control comorbidity , safety bariatric surgical procedure , include sleeve gastrectomy , specific group patient ( Class 1 Obesity ) . These observation suggest T2DM could treat bariatric surgery early possible , also time diagnosis . It hypothesize perform LSG T2DM diagnosis offer maximum benefit term attainment duration T2DM resolution/remission , potential thus prevent micro macrovascular complication without need take medication . Other positive aspect include possibility achieve appropriate weight loss relate improvement quality life . In randomized trial LSG compare conventional medical therapy treatment T2DM onset obese patient BMI 30 42 Kg/m2 .</detailed_description>
