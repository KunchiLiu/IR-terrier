	<detailed_description>Background Adherence active process wherein patient act collaboration medical paramedical staff order improve his/her health . Adherence medication comprise implementation persistence estimate around 50 % various chronic illness . Lack persistence great impediment adherence case ( drop approximately 60 % course year ) . Non-adherence prescribed treatment increase frustration patient provider increase health care cost , include unnecessary hospitalization illness exacerbation . A review World Health Organization ( WHO ) adherence therapy reveals dynamic complex issue associate simultaneously several factor : social economic factor , factor relate health care team/system , characteristic disease , characteristic disease therapy patient-related factor . In latter category patient-related issue review identifies follow major barrier : lack information skill , low motivation self-efficacy , lack support behavioral change . Other patient relate issue influence adherence include patient ' attribute : affective attribute ( depression anxiety ) cognitive attribute ( illness- relevant cognition , perception disease factor , belief treatment ) . The review emphasize low adherence give fact vast significance , WHO target `` best investment tackle chronic condition effectively '' . Phillips , Leventhal &amp; Leventhal propose add two process occur behavior initiation theorize contribute prediction long term medication adherence : 'coherence ' patient ' belief experience treatment habit development . Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) common neurologic disease affect young adult lead severe physical disability handicap . Research adherence MS indicate adherence rate similar chronic illness , namely hover around 50 % two year begin treatment . Patients fail properly adhere Disease Modifying Therapies ( DMTs ) regimen may increase risk development new central nervous system lesion , exacerbation , poor quality life . Plausible reason low adherence rate MS mention literature include patient ' attribute , condition attribute therapy related factor : Among patient ' attribute , research indicate 2 affective attribute relate low adherence MS : high prevalence depression anxiety . Research cognitive attribute indicate association illness ' perception , perception medication adherence general , knowledge , 's research directly address issue . To knowledge , 's research habit strength adherence , although habit strength find predictive low adherence asthma patient patient hypertension . Among condition-related factor consider MS adherence relapsing-remitting nature disease ( medicine sometimes prescribed patient feel well ) . There evidence patient observable symptom typically less likely adhere complex medication regimen . Hancock co-researchers find patient relatively stable disease likely demonstrate poor medication adherence poor appointment adherence . Among therapy relate factor , 32 % non-adherence explain injection mode delivery . Until recently available DMTs MS include three preparation beta interferon glatiramer acetate . These therapy inject regular basis associate immediate undesirable result : painful site reaction , flu-like symptom , increased spasticity , depression , fatigue significant percentage patient . In addition , non-direct effect agent ( unlike painkiller ) might one explanation poor adherence . Recently , FDA approve new DMTs MS take orally . Although plausible adherence rate would improve medication take orally oppose injected medicine , evidence contrary : instance , Mohr co-researchers find soreness injection site relate continue therapy ; Cramer find patient diabetes tend adherent inject therapy oral drug . Thus , adherence factor may different injected oral therapy , important study adherence two modality . We propose adherence medication mediate variable adjustment MS health outcome . To knowledge , research address directly issue psychological intervention promote adherence MS . Significance This study examine factor know literature affect adherence therapy MS chronic illness order create personal profile adherence . This profile allow development intervention tailor personal need barrier patient regard adherence . Improved adherence expect ensure treatment efficacy may prevent irreversible tissue damage , result prevention accumulate functional disability . This work may serve model study adherence therapy development intervention chronic disease . Design 400 patient treat planned begin treatment injected oral therapy approve Israeli Ministry Health treatment MS recruit `` Carmel '' MS Center . The propose study consist 4 phase : 1 . Personal profile - In order well understand therapy adherence patient MS , personal profile patient 's attribute , condition history therapy , take account factor related adherence mention , gather questionnaire . This profile call MyMS_PASS ( My Multiple Sclerosis Perception Adherence Scoring System ) . 2 . Implementation persistence -This phase include track 9 12 month patient ' personal profile , habit coherence expectation reality . 3 . Intervention - According profile assign phase 1 rate adherence therapy assess phase 2 , 50 % 80 % patient low rate consider candidate receive personalize intervention promote adherence therapy . These participant divide two group : first group , study group , offer intervention tailor factor find barrier adherence , apply health therapist addition regular healthcare MS clinic . The second group control group receive regular healthcare intervention . Some participant plan begin treatment MS recruitment may proceed phase 1 phase 3 , order ass effect intervention patient start therapy . 4 . Evaluation intervention- Interventions evaluate determine adherence therapy relevant variable baseline end study participant study . Adherence therapy intervention study control group compare . Study visit data collection : Visit 1 : Baseline- evaluation illness medication perception , adherence habit . Visit 2 : About 6 month begin follow-up- evaluation illness medication perception , adherence , habit experience psychological intervention Visit 3 : About 9 12 month begin follow-up- Evaluation adherence therapy factor related adherence . By end period intervention offer patient exhibit low adherence rate . Visit 4 : About 12 month initiation intervention . Evaluation adherence , habit , depression anxiety quality life , participant study . Proposed questionnaire : 1 . Personal Information Questionnaire 2 . Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire ( BIPQ ) 3 . Beliefs Medicines Questionnaire ( BMQ ) 4 . Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Experience Questionnaire ( MS-TEQ ) 5 . The Self-Report Habit Index ( SRHI ) 6 . Questions psychological intervention 7 . Adult Dispositional Hope Scale ( ADHS ) 8 . Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) 9 . The World Health Organization Quality Of Life ( WHOQOL-BREF ) 10 . Clinical questionnaire ( EDSS ) ( clinician ) 11 . Clinical follow-up questionnaire ( EDSS ) ( clinician ) Study Population MS patient visit MS center clinic Carmel Medical Center , treat planned begin treatment injected oral DMT MS. . Patients Recruitment MS patient visit MS center clinic Carmel Medical Center respond inclusion criterion invite participate study . Participants receive explanation Prof. Miller , attend neurologist authorize Prof Miller , study aim protocol . Patients agree participate sign inform consent . Information regard personal family medical history , include data education occupation , demographic ethnicity data collect via questionnaire . In addition , several questionnaire relate adherence treatment patient 's perception treatment , disease health also fill participant study visit , describe table `` Proposed questionnaire '' . Medical staff fill clinical questionnaire detail patient clinical status include adverse event study visit . Data also collect medical record , necessary . Data collect participant physician fill form medical record store coded Excel data base . Ethical Issues Data collection handling cod assure privacy participant handle Prof. Ariel Miller authorize staff . All key code lock . Participants ' follow-up visit clinic continue usual . Patients ' treatment influence study . Intervention promote adherence therapy manage M.Sc . health therapist . Ethical issue profession strictly keep . Data Management Data collect participant physician fill form medical record store cod data base . The database password protect . Prof Ariel Miller authorize staff responsible update data verification . Data Analysis Data analysis perform use SPSS statistical package version 22.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) . Comparisons continuous characteristic adherent non-adherent patient perform Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney test , accord data distribution . Categorical variable compare use Chi square test Fisher 's exact test small sample . To examine initiation persistence adherence medication among patient , McNemar test Paired T test Wilcoxon sign rank test apply appropriate . Multivariable Logistic regression model use examine association illness perception medication perception adherence , control background variable depression , anxiety , time since diagnosis medical condition . Odd Ratio 95 % confidence interval calculate model . The relationship variables MyMS_PASS rate adherence assess multiple logistic regression . Multivariable Logistic regression model use assess influence intervention adherence , control parameter . The association intervention continuous study parameter motivation , goal , habit formation , quality life test T-test Mann-Whitney test . Repeated measure test employ examine effect intervention illness medication perception time . All p value two-sided , statistical significance define p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
