	<brief_summary>This study examine benefit weight loss alone combination GLP1 receptor agonist , liraglutide , beta cell function young adult Mexican American ( MA ) woman prediabetes . The Investigators choose focus MA woman MA woman high risk progression diabetes traditionally involve weight management study since thought difficult recruit retain program . However , investigator particular success work young MA woman use specifically develop ethnic gender conscious program . Because weight loss prevent progression diabetes , participant receive diabetes medication , liraglutide , show stabilize beta cell function . The study also interrogate polymorphism know T2DM gene correlate beta cell response weight loss liraglutide treatment . Additionally , investigation target serious health disparity metabolic disease highly vulnerable , rapidly grow population , test novel gender culturally focus intervention strategy identify genetic biomarkers response pharmacologic intervention target pancreatic ßcell . These result help ) understand mechanisms disease , b ) personalize treatment identification high risk group may amenable specific therapy , c ) ultimately , set stage intervention trial prevent diabetes , major chronic costly disease , Mexican Americans .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators test hypothesis liraglutide , action β-cell , amplify effect lifestyle management improve β-cell function . Investigators recruit MA age 18-40 , since age incidence T2DM obese MA woman experience approach 50 % . The primary endpoint β-cell function ( AIRg ) response lifestyle change without GLP-1 agonist 3 month . Secondary endpoint reversal metabolic syndrome change plasma biomarkers . By end 3 month , prediabetic subject best possible metabolic control , investigator would predict liraglutide group would reveal good β-cell function . Thus , data time point use pharmacogenetic study . The program continue 3 month transition regular healthy meal goal weight maintenance . During second 3 month , subject liraglutide determine sustainability improve β-cell function . In absence weight re-gain , investigator predict intensive weight loss alone group would maintain improved β-cell function , intensive weight loss+liraglutide group would display even good function . These result provide useful information improve β-cell function management young woman pre-diabetes .</detailed_description>
