	<brief_title>Treatment Breast Fibroadenoma With FastScan HIFU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Echopulse specially design , manufacture CE mark treat breast fibroadenoma . HIFU completely alternative surgery utilizes high-energy ultrasound deliver large amount sound energy focal point rapidly induce tissue heat 85-90°C.This initiate tissue coagulation follow tissue necrosis ablate targeted area . In previous european feasibility study perform 4 site ( France Bulgaria ) , 51 fibroadenoma 42 patient treat . The HIFU treatment well tolerate show efficacy ( mean volume reduction 72.5 % +/-16.7 12 month follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female patient 18 year old one diagnose breast fibroadenoma . Diagnosis fibroadenoma must base : clinical examination , ultrasound image alone patient 35 year old . For woman old 35 year , mammogram perform addition ultrasound . The BIRADS ( Breast Imaging , Reporting Data System ) score mammogram must less 3. histologic confirmation core needle biopsy two independent reader ( biopsy must perform least two week therapy unless microbiopsy already do less 3 month inclusion visit histopathology slice available ) . The requirement distance skin follow region fibroadenoma : ≤ 23 mm posterior border fibroadenoma ≥ 5 mm anterior border fibroadenoma ≥ 11mm focal point HIFU treatment . These criterion shall evaluate immediately prior treatment breast immobilize potentially compress The rib cage prefocal ultrasound path behind target fibroadenoma ( minimum distance behind focal point= 10 mm ) . This criterion shall reach treatment condition , breast immobilize potentially compress . Patient 's fibroadenoma 1 cm great large dimension Fibroadenoma palpable Patient sign write informed consent . Patient pregnant lactating . Patient BIRADS score &gt; 2 mammogram , presence microcalcifications within lesion . Patient history breast cancer history Patient history laser radiation therapy target breast Patient breast implant target breast Patient breast cyst Patient 's fibroadenoma clearly visible ultrasound image ( B mode ) inclusion visit Patient participate trial use drug device .</criteria>
