	<brief_summary>The ultimate goal project evaluate possible new strategy diagnose earlier Parkinson 's disease , use superior colliculus biomarker . Preliminary data investigator 's group rat model Parkinson 's disease suggest superior colliculus , sensory structure , show early deficit visual processing . The investigator 's data also suggest evolution disease , structure present neuronal re-organisation lead cause sensory rebound introduction treatment . The light response superior colliculus faster , big amplitude last longer ( Rolland et al. , 2012 ) . Those result raise important question superior colliculus functional state Parkinson 's patient . If structure similar neuroplasticity , investigator could hypothesize superior colliculus may also present sensory rebound introduce treatment . If hypothesis true , accelerated amplify light response structure may explain difficulty felt patient inhibit reflexive saccade induce appearance unexpected visual stimulus . Indeed , superior colliculus involve orientation head eye toward sudden change environment ( Wurtz Albano , 1980 ) light response structure strongly correlate speed saccade ( Marino et al. , 2012 ) . Therefore , investigator want test similar deficit could observe superior colliculus newly diagnose PD patient . Data compare matching control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Superior Colliculus Activity Parkinson Disease : Potential Marker ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project aim well understand physiopathology Parkinson 's disease effect administration classical medical treatment . The main aim project evaluate possibility early detection use new original strategy . The investigator want demonstrate predictive value superior colliculus light response early biomarker . The investigator perform functional magnetic resonance imagery ( fMRI ) measure BOLD light response superior colliculus different key stage normal medical follow Parkinson 's patient neurologist ( diagnose , introduce first treatment treatment stabilise ) . Two group participant test : ) group de novo patient , diagnose n't start treatment ; b ) group match control . A first fMRI session ( S1 ) perform compare light induce BOLD response superior colliculus de novo patient match control . This session evaluate possible visual processing dysfunction superior colliculus newly diagnose patient . Parkinson 's patient start treatment second session ( S2 ) do group shortly introduction treatment measure acute effect . If superior colliculus patient present sensory rebound , investigator observe big light-induced BOLD response treatment compare treatment . A third session ( S3 ) perform optimal adjustment treatment motor symptom would around six month start treatment . This adjustment long difficult , realize neurologist accord effect motor symptom . Those two last fMRI allow investigator compare effect introduction treatment motor symptom , know improve correctly stage , non-motor symptom ( visual processing deficit project ) information available investigator knowledge .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>De novo parkinson 's patient diagnose ( stage 1 accord Hoehn Yahr scale : first unilateral sign discomfort everyday life ) without current dopaminergic treatment start antiparkinsonian treatment . Both Parkinson 's patient age match control must present major visual pathology ( mainly retina ) may interfere visual task . Signed informed free consent . Matching control must present neurological psychiatric trouble . For match control : There contraindication current treatment apart treat neurological disease Parkinson 's disease psychiatric trouble . For Parkinson 's patient : There contraindication current treatment apart treat neurological trouble include antiparkinsonian treatment , psychiatric trouble . As precaution , investigator check MRI exam perform week precede fMRI . Parkinson 's patient important tremor limit validity fMRI acquisition . Adult supervision Incapacity understand consent explanation . Impossibility participate whole experimental protocol . No affiliation health insurance . Consent sign participant refusal participant participate experiment . Pregnancy breast feed woman . Administrative justice freedom restrict participant . Exclusion Criteria specific MRI : Pacemaker , neurosensorial stimulator implant defibrillator . Presence ocular cerebral ferromagnetic material . Respiratory disease ( i.e . asthma ) , cardiovascular deficit , claustrophobia</criteria>
