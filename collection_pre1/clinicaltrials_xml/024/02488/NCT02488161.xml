	<brief_summary>Coordinated multi-center project several complementary goal one sub-projects include . Objectives : 1.To determine risk factor death , major complication short term ; 2.To determine risk factor death , tumor recurrence , major complication , readmission deterioration quality life mid term ; 3.Evaluation patient report outcome intervention end follow-up . 4.To study role immunohisto-chemistry marker prediction similar adverse result . This sub-project ( coordinator ) approach determination risk factor death , tumor recurrence , major complication , readmission deterioration quality medium term life ( 1-2 year ) . Methodology . Design : prospective cohort study 2 year follow-up surgical intervention . Participant center : 18 hospital 6 Autonomous Communities Spain . Patients diagnosed colorectal cancer surgically intervene . Variables : pre-intervention , hospital admission , sociodemographic , immunohisto-chemistry clinical parameter , could relation outcomes study . Statistic analysis : derivation sample create possible predict parameter identify , cancer colon rectum . Predictive model create good discriminative capacity . A validation model perform validation sub-sample . Logistic Cox regression model use . Simulation model prediction discreet event long term use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study include patient draw 22 hospital belong Spanish National Health Service ( SNS ) , cover majority ( 99.8 % ) population Spain . All cover resident free access primary care physician emergency department hospital . All hospital similar technological human resource . Patients diagnosis colon cancer attend surgical service hospital undergo surgery June 2010 December 2012 inform goal study invite voluntarily participate . In order take part study , patient provide inform consent . All information keep confidential . The Institutional Review Boards participate hospital approve project . Data collect Data collect upon hospital admission include information sociodemographic data , clinical data ( include information onset symptom , habit , personal family background , comorbidities , diagnostic test , pre-intervention treatment ) , preoperative data ( include analytical , tumor marker diagnostic test ) , data outpatient anesthesia data surgical intervention , pathology data , data relate remain day admission ( include presence complication , need reintervention death ) . Subsequently , data collect 30 day surgery ( analytical , diagnostic test , presence complication , readmission , reintervention death ) . Finally , information collect year include need radiation therapy , chemotherapy ( treatment schedule , cycle , complication treatment , supportive care ) , laboratory result diagnostic test perform , presence complication , tumor recurrence , readmission reintervention death . Patients complete follow questionnaire surgery one year surgery : EuroQol-5D , EORTC QLQ-C30 ( The European Organization Research Treatment Cancer quality life questionnaire ) QLQ-CR29 ( European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer questionnaire module colorectal cancer ) , HADS . The EuroQol-5D generic HRQoL questionnaire demonstrate good psychometric property allow comparison population . It translate validated Spanish . This instrument consist two part : first description state health five dimension : mobility , self-care , usual activity , pain / discomfort anxiety / depression . Each dimension measure three answer option define different level severity . The second visual analogue scale patient rate health scale display form thermometer ( 20 mm ) , whose end 0 ( worst imaginable health state ) 100 ( best state imaginable health ) . The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire evaluate HRQoL cancer patient undergoing treatment , show good validity reliability Spanish adaptation ( Cronbach 's alpha coefficient 0.7 ) . It one instrument measure quality life cancer patient commonly use allow comparison result obtain patient colorectal cancer patient cancer . It consist 30 item , 28 four possible answer ( , little , lot , lot ) two item seven Alternative ( visual analogue scale one `` poor '' seven `` excellent '' ) . The timeframe refer previous week . The score scale transform final value 0 100 . In addition overall score , instrument consist three scale : Global health status : high score represent high performance term overall health ; Functional -scale : consist five subscales operation : physical , role , emotional , cognitive social ; Symptoms scale consist number symptom : fatigue , nausea , vomit , pain , dyspnea , insomnia , decrease appetite , constipation , diarrhea financial difficulty . A high score symptom represent high level symptom problem area . The QLQ-CR29 develop revise QLQ-CR38 , demonstrate internationally sufficient validity reliability support use supplement EORTC QLQ-C30 ass patient-reported outcome treatment colorectal cancer clinical trial setting . The QLQ-CR29 contains 29 item , describe detail elsewhere . Briefly , 18 item address gastrointestinal symptom , pain problem micturition , separate scale participant without stoma separate item address sexual function men woman . The response categories item use QLQ-C30 .</detailed_description>
