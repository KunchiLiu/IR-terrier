	<detailed_description>This open-label randomise parallel pilot clinical trial . Sample size justification The sample size calculate base target control inflation factor . In order 95 % confident ( two-sided ) subsequent main study actually achieve power 80 % nominal power set 90 % ( i.e. , 10 % power forfeit ) , inflation factor less 1.15 . At IF = 1.15 , sample size 80 therefore need 95 % one-sided confidence main study achieve least nominal power test hypothesis add-on whole Chinese medicine treatment plan could effective stabilise glomerular filtration rate among diabetic nephropathy patient compare routine care . For subgroup analysis , sample size 25 patient per subgroup could achieve 80 % one-sided confidence effect stabilise glomerular filtration rate different within subgroup similar CM clinical pattern . With 5 subgroup , sample size 148 patient need pilot trial allow 15 % attrition rate . Data management A trial management committee ( TMC ) form Principal Investigator , Co-Investigator Research Assistant centralise data trial . Chinese Medicine Practitioner Research Assistant collect , clean send data patient TMC daily basis . Questionnaires clinical presentation Chinese Medicine diagnosis send , collect cleaned TMC directly daily Research Assistant . If response patient 30 day last contact , Research Assistant follow call patient . All data double enter computer clean analysis prevent data entry error . All transfer data include encryption follow guideline European Directive Good Clinical Practice adhere Data Protection Act protect patient ' confidentiality . TMC regular meeting monthly expert discuss progress trial . Data analysis Missing value , , imputed regression . Patient without postrandomisation assessment particular efficacy endpoint exclude analysis endpoint . Regression analysis use compare adjust mean estimate GFR , UACR , HbA1c , FBG , FGF-23 , MCP-1 Cystatin C week 48 1 ) combination intervention group combination control group , 2 ) individual treatment subgroup match control group , 3 ) different control group correspond baseline value covariates . Change score analysis supplement . To minimise Type I error inflation , analysis follow hierarchical approach order 1 ) individual treatment subgroup versus control subgroup , 2 ) combination intervention group versus combination control group avoid Type I error inflation . The primary outcome change GFR UACR . Subgroup analysis perform CKD stage 2 3 separately . Sensitivity analyse perform 1 ) miss data impute regression , 2 ) miss data impute last-observation-carried-forward ( LOCF ) 3 ) per protocol drop patient . The adverse event analyse narrative manner . The percentage adverse event rate attrition due adverse event compare intervention group control group .</detailed_description>
