	<brief_summary>The LEARN study multicenter , observational study evaluate rate cognitive change approximately 500 clinically normal old individual `` screen-fail '' A4 trial basis screen PET image demonstrate evidence elevate amyloid accumulation ( Aβ negative ) meet A4 study eligibility criterion . This study leverage A4 infrastructure maximize data acquire screen large number well-characterized old adult A4 trial . The LEARN observational cohort provide critical comparison group A4 placebo arm , future trial preclinical AD . Although accumulate longitudinal data suggest old individual elevate Aβ burden increase risk cognitive decline , important demonstrate differential rate clinical decline Aβe ( `` Aβ elevate '' ) Aβne ( `` Aβ elevate '' ) individual standardize set clinical outcome . Over 2000 well-characterized , highly motivated old volunteer `` screen fail '' A4 trial . The LEARN study follow 500 individual , match closely possible two treatment arm , observation cohort . The LEARN study may selectively recruit specific range SUVr fall threshold `` elevate amyloid '' order support analyse relationship baseline SUVr subsequent cognitive change amyloid accumulation . The observational cohort follow 168 week identical clinical/cognitive testing perform every 24 week , run parallel A4 treatment study .</brief_summary>
