	<brief_summary>The differential diagnosis asthma COPD sometimes difficult . Recently , overlap syndrome define base concurrence asthma COPD characteristic . These characteristic base expert opinion never investigate validate prospectively . The investigator assume management strategy , symptom burden disease progression differ asthma , COPD ACOS . Therefore , study want establish baseline criterion appropriate disease definition evaluate potential impact treatment symptom control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim test diagnostic algorithm obstructive airway disease may use daily practice obtain correct differential diagnosis , hence , initiate adequate therapy accord current guideline . The propose algorithm use categorize patient 4 different diagnosis specific treatment choice : asthma , obstructive asthma , overlap asthma COPD , COPD . The study evaluate test criteria contribute diagnostic work-up final diagnosis . Test battery diagnosis - spirometry bronchodilator reversibility test - bodyplethysmography : spirometry , volume , resistance , diffuse capacity - exhale NO - blood sample - CT scan thorax ( obstructive spirometry ) - histamine challenge ( spirometry obstructive ) - induce sputum ( protocol interpretation ) Definition endpoints 1 . Physician base diagnosis : diagnosis base clinical exam spirometry 2 . Algorithm base diagnosis : diagnosis base clinical exam test battery 3 . Final standard diagnosis diagnosis base clinical exam , test battery clinical evolution 1 year .</detailed_description>
