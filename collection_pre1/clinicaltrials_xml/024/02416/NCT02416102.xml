	<brief_summary>This proof concept , open label protocol evaluate effect losartan cigarette smoke-induced lung injury smoker , ex-smokers without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , give 50 mg subsequently 100 mg losartan 4 week Aim : To test inhibition T-cell growth factor ( TGF-ß ) losartan ex-smokers COPD active passive smoker without COPD lead increase chloride conductance calcium-activated chloride channel ( CACC ) , measure nasal potential difference ( NPD ) . Study design : The Investigators ass consequence active passive smoking treatment losartan CaCC-mediated chloride conductance human being use NPD measurement . NPD direct measure ion transport . It measure CaCC-mediated Cl- secretion thus serve indirect measure voltage-dependent potassium ( BK ) channel function . In addition , improvement NPD measure ion transport indirectly link lung function improvement clearance trial cystic fibrosis patient . Therefore , NPD lend good surrogate Mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) , proof concept clinical trial . The investigator also measure TGF-ß level nasal secretion cell correlate level CaCC-mediated Cl- conductance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Losartan Airway Mucociliary Dysfunction Patients With COPD Chronic Bronchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigator 's preliminary data show TGF-ß1 cigarette smoke exposure decrease BK activity cause airway surface liquid ( ASL ) volume depletion losartan partially rescue BK channel function lead increased ASL volume ciliary beat frequency ( CBF ) airway epithelial cell expose smoke . Therefore investigator propose smoke exposure , via TGF-ß1 production , lead apical BK channel dysfunction cause ASL volume depletion mucociliary dysfunction smoker ex-smokers COPD . Clinically use Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers ( ARBs ) know inhibit TGF-ß signaling present `` low-hanging-fruit '' approach ( medication already clinical use ) intervention COPD . In murine model , losartan previously show attenuate cigarette smoke-induced lung injury rescue lung architecture . The long-term goal study evaluate effect currently available clinically useful TGF-ß1 signaling inhibitor ( ARBs ) mucociliary function individual smoke-associated airway disease , chronic bronchitis COPD . To test hypothesis , subject COPD give four week 50 mg losartan daily consequently additional four week 100 mg losartan ( divide two dos 50 mg twice daily ) .</detailed_description>
