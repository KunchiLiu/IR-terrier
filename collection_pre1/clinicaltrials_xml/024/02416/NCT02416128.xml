It do use topical anesthetic dye instill onto cornea . The resident place Goldman tonometer onto cornea , use slit lamp , measure intraocular pressure . An attend ophthalmologist recheck finding intervene , necessary . These day measure efficacy use day efficacy measure use determine efficacy multiple different steroid eye drop . The goal project determine Euphrasia eye drop , least , non-inferior steroid control intraocular inflammation post-operative period peripheral laser iridotomy use treatment narrow angle glaucoma . Euphrasia use century treat conjunctivitis , standardize method delivery study prove efficacy . Currently , steroid eye drop first choice reduce intraocular inflammation . They use surgery , uveitis , certain form conjunctivitis . The big problem steroid patient `` steroid responder . '' These individual respond steroid large increase intraocular pressure lead optic nerve damage . Up 4 % patient use steroid spike pressure 31mmHg , normal intraocular pressure 21 less . These side effect occur little 5 day take steroid eye drop . Other , less common side effect : cataract , exacerbation bacterial/viral infection , ptosis , mydriasis , scleral melting , eyelid skin atrophy . With recent shift American public wanting use herbal supplement medication , important clinical study do prove efficacy herb .
