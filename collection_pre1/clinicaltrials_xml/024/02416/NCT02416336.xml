	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate whether Sentinella camera improve intraoperative detection removal sentinel lymph node ( SLNs ) use conjunction standard detection method . Of primary interest whether Sentinella camera identify additional tumor-positive SLNs miss use traditional imaging technique . Other outcomes related standard care use Sentinella camera may also assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Intraoperative Usage Sentinella Detecting Sentinel Lymph Nodes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sentinella FDA-approved , high-resolution , portable gamma camera give valuable visual guidance surgeon certain type cancer surgery , limited , visual guidance possible previously . The significance new aid improve possibility locate remove lymph node drain directly tumors—so-called `` SLNs '' —in order accurately assess stag cancer well best possible operative post-operative treatment . Sentinella confirm significant lymph node miss document `` clean field '' patient 's permanent record . Usually , one SLN . False-negative SLN biopsy result may impair patient outcome several reason : miss node might lead recurrence potentially difficult treat occasion , involve node may potential secondary source distant metastasis , understaging affect decision systemic therapy specific radiation therapy . Missing SLNs one main factor increase false-negative rate . Sentinel node biopsy undoubtedly standard care breast cancer melanoma vital information histological status node give . Correct identification SLNs challenge limitation current preoperative imaging lack visualization OR : - What appear single node preoperative lymphoscintigraphy SPECT turn 2 different node close together . This due relatively low spatial resolution technology . - Structures `` hidden '' structure principle tumor/injection site , make identification difficult impossible . In case , Sentinella discover structure upon removal principle tumor aid surgeon removal . - Currently use gamma probe give audible non-recorded aid surgeon easily miss structure 2 cm deep tissue . Sentinella give additional visual information surgical team improve patient outcome . It replace , rather compliment current standard procedure , offer precise documentation step procedure keep permanently patient 's record . 1 . After standard injection radiotracer image perform preoperatively , Sentinella use OR identify position structure mark skin surgeon 's reference . 2 . Before removal , Sentinella use visualize quantify radioactivity structure . This information store future reference . 3 . Upon removal structure , Sentinella use verify ex-vivo activity structure remove . 4 . After removal verification structure plan , Sentinella use confirm active structure leave document result `` clean field '' The current standard care surgical SLN biopsy involve use gamma probe . In study , investigator prospectively collect Sentinella image obtain standard care procedure compare correlate finding standard care image study , treatment outcome information .</detailed_description>
