	<brief_title>Exercise Genes : Genomic Association With Exercise Reinforcement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose individual 's genetics one factor may associate motivate aspect attractiveness exercise therefore choice exercise rather sedentary . They propose study association genomic signature reinforce ( motivate ) value different type exercise . This never investigate may uncover underlying mechanism would help understand individual difference exercise motivation . The ultimate impact work great number Americans physically active , meeting United States Department Agriculture ( USDA ) dietary guideline physical activity , maintain healthy body weight . This study fund undertaken Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center ( GFHNRC ) . The purpose assess genetic underpinnings motivate value resistance aerobic exercise , determine whether motivate value aerobic resistance exercise associate usual participation mode exercise .</detailed_description>
