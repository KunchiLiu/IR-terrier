	<brief_summary>This single arm open label , multicenter , non randomize , access study trametinib subject histologically confirm cutaneous melanoma BRAF V600E/K positive mutation either advance unresectable ( stage IIIc ) distant metastatic ( stage IV ) . Trametinib may give monotherapy combination since first line metastatic melanoma per inclusion criterion . Subjects receive prior BRAF inhibitor may include progressed treatment present limited progression per eligibility criterion . It estimate 250 400 subject histologically confirm cutaneous melanoma BRAF V600E/K positive mutation either advance unresectable ( stage IIIc ) distant metastatic ( stage IV ) enrol .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Provides sign date informed consent , age time consent &gt; =18 year . Has histologically confirm cutaneous melanoma BRAF V600E/K positive mutation either unresectable ( stage IIIc ) distant metastatic ( stage IV ) . Is eligible enrolment ongoing relevant hypothesis test clinical study metastatic melanoma , eligible , geographically distant participate site attend frequent clinic visit feasible . Has participate follow GSK sponsor clinical study ( COMBIv : MEK116513 , COMBId : MEK115306 , COMBIAD : BRF115532 ) melanoma indication prior participate open label access study . Is able swallow retain oral medication . For subject active brain metastasis : subject require ineligible immediate local treatment . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 2 stable clinical condition . NOTE : subject rapidly deteriorate clinical condition prior start therapy consider open label access study . ECOG 3 subject may include provide subject clinically stable investigator 's judgement . Does require treatment another anticancer therapy open label access study ( except dabrafenib combination trametinib ) . Does require treatment prohibit concomitant medication . Does medical condition physical examination clinical laboratory finding , opinion investigator and/or GSK Medical Monitor , would put subject high risk adverse outcome . Where applicable , female subject childbearing potential must agree use one contraceptive method list study protocol . These subject must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior first dose trametinib , preferably close first dose possible , agree use adequate contraception time pregnancy test , throughout treatment period total 4 month follow last dose treatment . For subject enrol France : subject eligible inclusion study , either affiliate beneficiary social security category . Subjects receive prior therapy MEK BRAF inhibitor . NOTE : However subject may eligible follow case : Subjects whose tumor progress base radiographic clinical assessment . Such subject may receive therapy : trametinib combination dabrafenib ( case adverse event relate previous BRAF MEK inhibitor trametinib dabrafenib without crossreaction anticipate , clinically indicate accord investigator judgement ) . Prior treatment ( except trametinib dabrafenib ) stop period 5 half live 28 day ( whichever shorter ) start treatment study ; trametinib monotherapy subject benefit treatment BRAFinhibitor without progression receive anymore due tolerability reason . Subjects meet criterion disease progression may receive trametinib combination dabrafenib : disease progression confirm period least 6 month clinical benefit ( Response Stable Disease ) monotherapy progression characterize limited radiographic progression absence clinical sign symptom progression . treatmentrelated grade 4 AEs SAEs occur last 4 week treatment . Concurrent treatment systemic anticancer therapy allow ( except dabrafenib combination trametinib ) . Subjects currently treat another systemic anticancer therapy ( e.g . chemo , immune , biologic , target therapy ) must discontinue use prior initiation treatment open label access study period 5 half live 28 day ( whichever shorter ) . Presence malignancy melanoma within 1 year enrolment program malignancy confirm activate RAS mutation . Subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . Note : Prospective RAS testing require . However , result previous RAS test know , must use assess eligibility . Has know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate trametinib dabrafenib , excipients dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) . Current evidence/risk retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) central serous retinopathy ( CSR ) Current evidence cardiovascular risk include follow : Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; low limit normal ( LLN ) ; A QT interval correct heart rate use Bazett 's formula &gt; =480 millisecond ( msec ) ; Clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmia ; Acute coronary syndrome ( include myocardial infarction unstable angina ) ; Congestive heart failure &gt; =Class II define New York Heart Association .</criteria>
