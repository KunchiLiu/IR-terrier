	<brief_summary>Stroke second cause death worldwide represent first cause death Brazil 2006 2010 . Most patient survive , need develop cost-effective rehabilitation strategy decrease burden disability stroke . This study address important issue , combine two different intervention early phase post-stroke : robotic therapy associate transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , adjuvant intervention conventional physical therapy , motor upper limb rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robotic Therapy Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Patients With Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our main goal confirm safety robotic therapy associate active tDCS conventional therapy , compare robotic therapy associate sham tDCS conventional therapy , conventional therapy alone , upper limb rehabilitation early phase ( 3-9 week ) stroke . Patients randomize receive one three treatment , 3 time per week , 6 week . Data eventual adverse effect collect session treatment . The work hypothesis robotic therapy associate active tDCS conventional therapy safe robotic therapy associate conventional therapy , conventional therapy alone . We aso preliminarily evaluate efficacy robotic therapy associate active tDCS conventional therapy , compare robotic therapy associate sham tDCS conventional therapy alone , improvement upper limb motor impairment . Our secondary goal : 1 ) To evaluate safety upper limb motor impairment patient submit three intervention , 6 month end treatment ; 2 ) To compare effect abovementioned intervention disability , spasticity quality life , patient early stage stroke , immediately treatment 6 month later . The work hypothesis association robotic therapy , tDCS conventional therapy lead well outcomes robotic therapy conventional therapy , conventional therapy alone . Patients assess first session last session treatment , well 6 month last session treatment .</detailed_description>
