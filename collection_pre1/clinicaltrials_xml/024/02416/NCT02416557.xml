	<brief_summary>Intraoperative hypothermia associate many clinical adverse outcome . Many technique apply prevent intraoperative hypothermia , positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) know blunt intraoperative hypothermia increase thermoregulatory vasoconstriction threshold . The investigator assess effect PEEP prevention intraoperative hypothermia spine surgery prone position .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect PEEP Intraoperative Hypothermia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well know intraoperative hypothermia associate postoperative adverse clinical outcome various study population . Intraoperative hypothermia various adverse effect include impaired drug clearance , cold diuresis hypovolemia , immunosuppression increase infection risk , electrolyte disorder , coagulopathy impair platelet function , negative nitrogen balance , shiver , insulin resistance , myocardial event . Numerous method introduce prevent intraoperative hypothermia , warm infusion fluid , forced-air warming , heat-pads , heated water mattress , heat humidifiers . However , patient undergo lumbar spine surgery prone position , method prevent intraoperative hypothermia may partially effective method , clinical practice , significant limitation application . Positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) reduce venous return increase intrathoracic pressure . This cause carotid unloading , lead secondary peripheral vasoconstriction increase thermoregulatory vasoconstriction threshold blunts intraoperative hypothermia . Previous study demonstrate intraoperative PEEP significantly attenuate extent intraoperative hypothermia patient undergo tympanoplasty . However , beneficial effect PEEP thermoregulation investigate patient prone position spinal surgery . The investigator hypothesize PEEP reduce extent intraoperative hypothermia via thermoregulatory modulation . In study , investigator investigate effect PEEP intraoperative core body temperature incidence intraoperative hypothermia patient undergoing spinal surgery</detailed_description>
