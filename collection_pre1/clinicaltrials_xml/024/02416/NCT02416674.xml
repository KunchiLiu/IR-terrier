	<detailed_description>Abdominal wall transplantation surgery , transfer abdominal wall tissue decease human donor patient large abdominal wall defect , experimental reconstructive procedure potential significantly improve life patient . In abdominal wall transplantation , tissue transplant include skin , tendon , muscle , ligament , bone blood vessel . The transplant team Brigham Women 's Hospital include wide variety medical surgical specialty . The team BWH actively seek qualify candidate abdominal wall transplantation research study . We study small group people learn : - How advance science abdominal wall transplantation - How support limit transplant rejection issue - How people abdominal wall transplantation We describe abdominal wall transplant surgery life-giving procedure potential dramatically improve , restore , patient 's mental physical health his/her ability function integrate society . However , type organ transplantation , improvement require patient make lifetime commitment take medication suppress body 's immune system . Conventional reconstruction method always consider first , may provide less optimal result certain patient . There method available reconstruct abdominal wall . However , may yield unsatisfactory outcome patient . Abdominal wall transplantation surgery , however , potential deliver desire functional aesthetic benefit . Functionally , abdominal wall transplant surgery provide patient new abdominal wall , extensive rehabilitation , provide mobility natural aesthetic appearance . From time begin search qualified abdominal wall transplant recipient continue care provide follow surgery , significant amount time , expertise attentiveness contribute toward make procedure progressive success . Abdominal wall transplant candidate go extensive screening process likely last several month . This screen include psychiatric social support evaluation series imaging test help determine patient 's physical mental readiness procedure . If , upon completion screen process , determine patient suitable candidate , place patient transplant wait list . We begin work United Network Organ Sharing find donor match recipient 's tissue requirement - example similar age correct blood type . This search could take many month , , suitable donor find within one year , speak patient determine whether he/she willing continue wait .</detailed_description>
