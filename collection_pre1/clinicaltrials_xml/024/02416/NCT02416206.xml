	<brief_summary>High-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) part up-front treatment patient multiple myeloma associate improved disease-free overall survival multiple large randomize controlled trial . Following 3-6 cycle standard induction therapy biologic agent , consolidation high dose Melphalan ASCT become standard-of-care approach fit myeloma patient 70 year age . Single-agent high-dose Melphalan ( 200mg/m2 ) currently standard-of-care preparative regimen prior autologous transplant Myeloma . Historical study utilize Busulfan- Total Body Irradiation-based preparative regimen yield similar result single-agent Melphalan high toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Dose Chemotherapy Using BeEAM Autologous Transplant Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myeloma patient , follow up-front induction therapy , receive ASCT follow high-dose bendamustine-based preparative regimen ( BeEAM ) . The primary endpoint trial rate CR day 100 post-transplant . Experience literature , well result institution , suggest follow ASCT upfront treatment myeloma , rate CR day 100 post-transplant approximately 45 % . It hop protocol , rate least 65 % . Thus statistically formalize study test null hypothesis p , CR rate 0.65 versus alternative hypothesis p less 0.45 . A sample size 65 pt give 90 % power alpha=0.05 , use formula one sample binomial ( two-sided ) test proportion .</detailed_description>
