	<brief_summary>The integrity structural connectivity support cortical region leave brain hemisphere hypothesize enable treatment-induced naming recovery person language difficulty stroke ( aphasia ) . We map whole brain connectivity ( i.e. , brain connectome ) investigate role cortical connectivity impairment ( Aim 1 ) recovery ( Aim 2 ) patient aphasia undergoing treatment . This information use construct personalized marker anomia treatment outcome ( Aim 3 ) , may serve guide speech-language pathologist neurologist face patient management decision .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aphasia , impairment language processing , one common consequence stroke affect dominant brain hemisphere4 . Patients aphasia usually incapable working , interaction family friend often severely affected . The hallmark deficit aphasia inability name object people ( anomia ) 12 . The severity anomia closely related poor quality life . While many patient aphasia exhibit language recovery first day week stroke , 30-40 % persist long last name impairments4 . Fortunately , speech therapy effective improve name patient chronic aphasia5-8 . However , well recognize among clinician speech therapy ineffective patient , make difficult predict patient benefit naming treatment , others show little improvement . Here , propose evaluate whether name impairment name recovery related extent structural damage cortical language network . Importantly , evaluate damage combine effect cortical necrosis cortical disconnection . We hypothesize assess anomia either due gray matter necrosis due cortical disconnection constitutes false dichotomy since chronic patient exhibit gray white matter damage15 . Furthermore , propose disconnection seemingly spar cortical area till underappreciated patient stroke due limitation brain connectivity assessment tool . By examine area cortical necrosis without consider disconnect area , one may underestimate magnitude language network damage . A good understanding effect cortical damage disconnection anomia recovery could lead improved clinical management aphasia . We employ innovative concept brain connectome , i.e. , individualize map neural connection brain , evaluate whether naming recovery support preserved gray matter preserve connectivity involve key language area leave hemisphere . We propose left frontal leave temporal connectivity map base individual 's connectome important explanatory variable towards name impairment recovery . We believe research significant three main reason . First , direct clinical impact provide well understanding patient benefit therapy . Second , unveil neurobiological mechanism support language recovery , improve understand brain plasticity related language rehabilitation . Finally , disconnection contributes language impairment , method develop test specific theory language organization brain . The significance aspect explain detail .</detailed_description>
