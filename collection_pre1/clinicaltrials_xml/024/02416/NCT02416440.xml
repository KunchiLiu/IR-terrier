	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES - To estimate prevalence diabetes mellitus associate cardiometabolic infectious risk factor population - To provide aetiological insight variation cardiometabolic infectious risk factor adults use population genetic epidemiological approach - To compare diagnostic test diabetes population - To create unique framework build large scale cross sectional study African population examine wide range health indices—and lay groundwork additional long-term study - inform health policy public health programme aim address rise non-communicable disease ( NCDs ) South Africa , may also shape public health strategy African country STUDY DESIGN The DDS involve number stage : Stage 1 : Geographical sampling frame The eThekwini Municipality ( city Durban ) select initial sampling frame broken nine planning unit cluster ( PUCs ) , represent nine township ( Umlazi , Inanda , KwaMashu , Ntuzuma , Mpumalanga Complex , Cato Manor , Clermont , Lamontville Chesterville ) total population approximately 1,378,750 individual . Streets randomly select PUC proportional PUC size proportion formal informal housing PUC . Households select systematic cluster sample home locate randomly select street . Stage 2 : Community awareness Once local ethic approval obtain BioMedical Research Ethics Committee University KwaZulu-Natal ( UKZN ) support KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Department Health obtain , local health authority community leader nine PUCs , contact approval . Stage 3 : Participant enrolment Once select PUC area sensitise study ( end Stage 2 ) , visit DDS team . During stage DDS team visit household select neighbourhood family member African descent , pregnant age 18 year older invite participate study . Consent obtain resident agree participate . All resident invite attend central venue ( i.e . local community centre/school ) follow week DDS team collect health lifestyle questionnaire information , perform simple biophysical measure collect blood urine sample . While recruit participant community , DDS team use geographical information system ( GIS ) map technique gather accurate geographical boundary data select PUC area . Stage 4 : Data sample collection , test data analysis Data sample collection undertaken specific morning central venue . This important participant require fast overnight oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . Questionnaire biophysical data study collect , store electronically , analyse . Blood urine sample transport University KwaZulu-Natal Durban storage . Laboratory test do private laboratory . Some sample send specialist centre UK , Europe , USA country genomic analysis . Stage 5 : Feedback result study participant Starting eight week sample collection , participant result available DDS feedback office . All OGTT lipid result post back participant , unless choose receive . To receive result ( e.g . HIV , hepatitis C virus [ HCV ] , liver function test ) participant must make appointment DDS feedback office collect result . This optional , participant wish collect result choose contact DDS feedback office . If appropriate , participant collect result abnormal potentially harmful advised visit local clinic hospital investigation management part standard clinical care . DATA AND SAMPLE COLLECTION A . Collection sample 1 . Blood sample overview Only fast participant eligible complete blood sample collection . Non-fasted participant eligible collection 10 ml plain serum four ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) blood sample . Aseptic venepuncture perform register research nurse via close evacuate blood collection system , use standardised procedure minimise risk infection.. 2 . Blood sample require Eleven blood tube collect fasted participant : 10 ml plain serum tube , two 10 ml EDTA whole blood tube , two 2 ml EDTA whole blood tube , OGTT , three 2 ml sodium fluoride ( NaF ) tube three 2 ml plain serum blood tube . Thus , maximum 46 ml venous blood ( approximately three tablespoon blood ) take participant . For non-fasted participant , 10 ml plain serum sample four EDTA whole blood sample collect . Since link anonymous HIV test undertaken part study , study nurse train HIV counsel follow relevant national guideline . For fasted participant , 75 g OGTT perform recommend WHO . Categories glucose tolerance accord WHO 1998 Classification . The 10 ml plain serum tube use test blood infectious disease cardiometabolic biomarkers . The first 10 ml EDTA whole blood tube ship UK genetic analysis . The second 10 ml EDTA whole blood tube undergoes plasma extraction HCV viral load test RNA extraction . The two 2 ml EDTA whole blood tube use HbA1c test full blood count , respectively . Linked anonymous HIV testing As part study , consent participant test HIV via link anonymous test . This do accordance national guideline . 3 . Urine sample collection A spot ( untimed ) urine sample take measure albumin-to-creatinine ratio urinary sodium potassium . B . Collection questionnaire data Once appropriate consent obtain blood sample collection begin , participant move questionnaire station . The questionnaire use study electronic questionnaire ( EQ ) adaptation standardise validate WHO STEPwise approach Surveillance ( STEPS ) tool design collection chronic disease risk factor , include socio-demographic index , lifestyle , infectious disease risk factor cardiometabolic history . C. Collection biophysical measurement Study participant move biophysical measurement station do use calibrate validated equipment . The following measure take use standardised protocol : - Height weight ( used calculate body mass index ) - Waist circumference hip circumference ( used calculate waist-hip ratio ) - Mid upper-arm circumference - Blood pressure heart rate BLOOD SAMPLE ANALYSES All blood sample assay infectious cardiometabolic biomarkers private laboratory Durban . Confirmatory HIV test do . Below list laboratory method use serological biochemical test : - Plasma glucose : Enzymatic method , base hexokinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzymes - Serum creatinine : Based reaction picric acid creatinine alkaline medium - Serum lipid : - Cholesterol : Enzymatic method , use cholesterol esterase cholesterol oxidase conversion , follow Trinder endpoint - Triglycerides : Based Fossati three step enzymatic reaction Trinder endpoint . The single reagent procedure quantifies total triglyceride include mono- di-glycerides free glycerol fraction - HDL : Enzymatic reaction base procedure develop Izawa , Okada Matsui - LDL : Calculated use Friedewald formula enzymatic method - Lipoprotein ( ) : Turbidometric ( Beckmann ) - HbA1c : High performance liquid chromatography . Instrument : BioRad Variant II - HIV : 4th generation ELISA ( Abbott Architect ) - Hepatitis B C : ELISA DNA RNA extraction take place University KwaZulu-Natal , University Cambridge , Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , authorise third party facility UK . The study coordinator responsible shipping sample UK DNA RNA extraction . Purified DNA RNA send Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , UK , genetic analysis . GENETIC ANALYSIS 1 .
