	<detailed_description>This protocol design treatment protocol . Patients enrol study treat accord treat physician 's plan care , independent enrollment study . Once enrol , physician may proceed appropriate plan care period specimen analysis indicate . Upon return result , therapy may may alter base upon patient 's pathology , pertinent medical treatment history , image study , available clinical trial , CLIA validate clinical molecular profiling result . Regardless result , patient offer treatment select empirical basis treat physician individual site . All patient enrol study follow clinical outcome . Clinical molecular profiling result expire 14 week follow date Foundation One report receive . No investigational agent administer part study . However , patient may refer open clinical trial base result profile . Patients refer clinical trial may receive investigational agent separate clinical trial accordance write protocol subsequently enrol . All anti-neoplastic drug use participate study , whether use on-label off-label , administered patient route administration publish FDA approve package insert . In addition , dose agent ( include dose modification ) calculate base upon publish FDA approve package insert .</detailed_description>
