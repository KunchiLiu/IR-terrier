	<brief_title>Immediate Effects Whole Body Vibration Neuromuscular Performance Quadriceps Femoris Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design research site : This randomize blind clinical trial hold Laboratory Neuromuscular Performance Department Physical Therapy , Federal University Rio Grande Norte ( UFRN ) . Characterization sample : The sample consist 60 woman randomly divide 3 distinct group . Ethical aspect : For implementation , project submit Research Ethics Committee ( REC ) Federal University Rio Grande Norte . Was respect ensure autonomy anonymity participant , well privacy confidential data , govern Resolution 196/96 National Health Council Helsinki declaration human research . Instruments : Stationary bicycle ( Ergo-Fit , ErgoCycle 167 , Pirmasens , Germany ) ; computerize baropodometry platform Eclipse 3000 model ( Guy-Capron® SA , France ) ; vibrate platform model Power Plate® pro5 ™ ; signal conditioning module ( Telemyo direct transmission system ) 8-channel ( Noraxon , USA ) ; self-adhesive electrode active surface ( Noraxon , USA ) ; isokinetic dynamometer ( Biodex Multi-Joint System 4 , Biomedical Biodex System Inc.® , New York , USA ) . Procedures : There previous pilot study adequacy research procedures train evaluator . The volunteer inform procedure perform research , sign informed consent form , fill evaluation form anthropometric data personal examination member . Evaluations perform intervention protocol . Initially , volunteer execute warm exercise stationary bike 5 minute . Postural balance : volunteer place stand baropodometry platform , support non-dominant member knee keep 20 ° flexion . The dominant member remain knee 90 ° flexion . The evaluation repeat 3 time , consider analysis average two best measure . The evaluation time 20 second acquisition frequency 20 Hz period 1 minute break test . Previously participant allow become familiar equipment . Joint position sense : volunteer position sit dynamometer , stabilize brace device axis align knee evaluate . The apparatus lever arm attach distal leg . Then , volunteer instruct perform knee extension member start 90 ° flexion . When 45 target angle wa reach , dynamometer arm remain position , keep 5 second , voluntary notice angle achieve . Finally , prompt active extension 90 ° knee flexion ( 1 / ) target angle , second trial subject . At moment , volunteer trigger device record angle reach . Torque rating : keep previous position , normalization electromyographic signal held , subject perform two maximal voluntary isometric contraction knee extension angle 60 ° 5 , one-minute interval repetition . Then concentric evaluation conduct , 5 maximal contraction knee flexion extension 60 ° / , start 90 ° flexion full extension . Electromyographic activity : emg collect concurrently exercise protocol platform , well torque rating . The volunteer submit shave clean skin 70 % alcohol attach electrode .</detailed_description>
