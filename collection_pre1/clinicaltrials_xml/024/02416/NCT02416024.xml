	<brief_summary>Induction general anesthesia patient could challenge period anesthesia management . Due autonomic system suppression , hemodynamic fluctuation , hypotension hypertension , commonly see period . Furthermore , observed fraction patient develop hypotension may refractory vasoactive medication attempt restore systemic arterial blood pressure back acceptable level . Previous study show patient chronically take angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors high incidence develop hypotension general anesthesia well refractory adrenergic vasoconstrictor medication give help restore systemic blood pressure . Interestingly , patient take ACE inhibitor show described hemodynamic response induction general anesthesia . Therefore , investigator attempt identify change vascular physiology patient may contribute acute refractory systemic hypotension . Specifically , investigator wish explore whether difference baseline level arterial stiffness potentially contribute phenomenon . Arterial applanation tonometry non-invasive technique show reliably provide index arterial stiffness . In proposed project , applanation tonometry perform right carotid femoral artery ass carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity , surrogate aortic stiffness . ( SphygmoCor system , AtCor Medical , Sydney , Australia ) The measurement obtain induction general anesthesia pre-surgical area . During induction general anesthesia standard induction agent , brachial blood pressure measure cuff every minute 10 minute tracheal intubation . A hypotensive response anesthesia define systolic arterial blood pressure 90mmHg upon induction . Hypotensive patient respond vasoconstrictor medication ( i.e . require 200 mcg phenylephrine maintain systolic arterial blood pressure 90 mmHg ) classify 'refractory hypotensive . '' Using non-invasive applanation tonometry , able examine aortic stiffness propensity become refractory hypotension induction general anesthesia . This information potentially help identify future patient might great risk develop refractory hypotension response induction general anesthesia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Induction anesthesia consist administration anesthetic follow endotracheal intubation . During induction anesthesia moderate hemodynamic disturbance ( either systemic arterial hyper- hypo-tension ) common due concurrent autonomic nervous system suppression stress response endotracheal intubation . Previous study demonstrate patient chronically treat angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) -inhibitors high incidence develop hypotension induction general anesthesia , typically , restore small dos adrenergic drug phenylephrine ( 100 200 mcg ) acceptable blood pressure level . However , patient develop hypotension may refractory medication , turn pose significant challenge control hemodynamics patient . The consequence severe hypotension could cancel surgery , ischemic stroke , myocardial infarction even death . Interestingly , refractory systemic hypotension occur anesthetized patient prescribed ACE inhibitor . Notably , easily treatable systemic arterial hypotension induction general anesthesia clinical problem . Critical issue arise patient general anesthesia respond therapeutic dos adrenergic agonist . Therefore , identify patient demonstrate refractory hypotension induction general anesthesia novel idea significant clinical implication peri-operative blood pressure control anesthesiologists . Thus , overall goal propose research use preoperative non-invasive measure vascular stiffness predict patient might risk severe hypotension refractory adrenergic vasoconstrictor medication follow induction general anesthesia patient chronically treat angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor . Method/Design : The study human subject non-randomized observational study . This study conduct day surgery administration area main operation room University Iowa Hospitals clinic . Arterial stiffness measure day surgery administration area prior surgery . Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity ( Aortic Stiffness ) . Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( cfPWV ) determine applanation tonometry use Sphygmocor system sequentially record ECG-gated carotid femoral artery waveform . Pulse wave signal record tonometer position base right common carotid artery right femoral artery . The time ( ) foot simultaneously record wave determine mean 10 consecutive cardiac cycle . PWV calculate system software distance measurement point ( D ) measure time delay ( ) follow : cfPWV = D/Δt ( m/s ) D distance meter time interval second . Prior induction intravenous fluid administration restrict less 500 ml . A standardized protocol follow commonly use anesthesia provider . Prior induction anesthesia , addition ASA standard monitor , neuromuscular twitch monitor Entropy monitor attach patient . Induction agent include 1.5mg/kg propofol , 2µg/kg fentanyl , 100mg lidocaine , 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium lean body weight . Inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane 0.5 MAC 5L/min 100 % oxygen start mask ventilation till 10 minute tracheal intubation . Blood pressure measure brachial cuff prior induction every minute intubation 10 minute . If systolic pressure drop 90 mmHg 25 % baseline , patient classify study `` Hypotensive . '' Conversely , patient 's systolic blood pressure drop 90 mmHg 25 % baseline within 10 minute intubation , patient classify `` Not Hypotensive . '' If patient 's systolic blood pressure rise 25 % baseline value , anesthesiologist administer bolus 0.5mg/kg propofol . This bolus repeat minute blood pressure evaluation systolic blood pressure back baseline value . These patient classify `` Not Hypotensive , '' administration propofol note . In attempt bring systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg 25 % baseline `` hypotensive '' patient , anesthetic provider use 100µg phenylephrine ( 5mg ephedrine heart rate &lt; 50bpm ) within 10 minute intubation . If 200µg phenylephrine ( 10mg ephedrine ) use without return systolic brachial blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg 25 % baseline , patient classify study `` Refractory Hypotensive . '' The study environment end provider use whatever vasoactive drug deem appropriate , include phenylephrine , ephedrine , epinephrine , norepinephrine , vasopressin , and/or fluid bolus . The total give dos vasopressor medication record . Anesthetic induction , blood pressure measurement , medication correct low high blood pressure describe part patient ' standard clinical procedure perform anesthesiologist . The patient require 2 time laryngoscopy , required standard anesthetic , entropy &gt; 70 &lt; 30 , exclude data analysis .</detailed_description>
