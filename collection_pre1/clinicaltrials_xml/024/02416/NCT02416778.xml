	<brief_summary>Disordered iron metabolism characterize important determinant impair exercise tolerance work capacity . Iron-deficiency anemia commonly feature impaired aerobic capacity cause decreased oxygen carry capacity , associate negative effect dyspnea walk distance . Apart , iron deficiency without anemia show affect endurance energetic efficiency via decreased tissue oxidative capacity . Consequently , deplete iron store could capable cause fatigue , breathlessness impair exercise tolerance , common feature chronic cardiopulmonary disease like chronic heart failure ( CHF ) COPD ( Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ) . Indeed , current surge interest aim potential underlying determinant CHF COPD independent primarily disorder organ . Recent study identify iron deficiency without anemia independent factor reduce exercise intolerance CHF well COPD . Moreover , intravenous iron application significantly improve exercise capacity CHF patient iron deficiency presence well absence anemia . Comparable CHF , daily living patient COPD compromise impaired exercise tolerance . However , airflow limitation , foremost characteristic COPD show weak association exercise capacity . In line , exercise capacity show remarkable improvement lung transplant recipient , underline presence systemic determinant limited exercise tolerance like iron deficiency . The investigator show iron deficiency present 50 % stable COPD patient ( unpublished data ) , accord recently publish data . The investigator presume iron deficiency contributes limit exercise capacity COPD patient . Thus , aim study determine whether iv iron associate increase exercise capacity COPD . Therefore investigator hypothesize fill deplete iron storage increase exercise capacity , measure 6-MWT ( Minute Walking Test ) .</brief_summary>
