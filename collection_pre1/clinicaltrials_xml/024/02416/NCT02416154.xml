	<brief_summary>The propose study aim determine expression Interferon-ε ( IFNε ) female genital tract , never map human . High expression mammalian female reproductive tract ( FRT ) suggest important anti-sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) /HIV immunity expression decrease progestogen treatment . Future study plan understand hormonal contraceptive affect presence interferon healthy female genital tract , potentially change risk STI HIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To optimize measurement protocol IFNε relate biomarkers sample female reproductive tract . 2 . To quantify characterize IFNε expression upper low genital tract blood normally cycle woman follicular luteal phase menstrual cycle . Study design : This single site , parallel cross-sectional study Specific Aims : The aim study determine `` IFNε -related assay '' perform different type FRT sample . The possible `` IFNε-related assay '' : - IFNε messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) level quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT PCR ) ( require frozen tissue process RNA ) - IFN Regulated Gene expression qRT PCR , microarray target gene set use Fluidigm platform ( frozen tissue ) - PR ER gene expression ( ) - IFNε tissue protein levels* ( immunoassay ) progesterone estrogen receptor ( PR/ER ) Western blotting ( frozen tissue ) - IFNε Neopterin ( well characterize compound whose production stimulate IFNs whose specificity set need validation ) IFNε-biomarkers** immunoassay cervicovaginal lavage ( CVL ) fluids - Immunohistochemistry IFNε , PR/ER , + ( e.g . cell , cytokine ) ( fix tissue ) - Studies FRT sample wild type IFNε-/- mouse would use first validate Neopterin `` biomarker '' IFNε activity FRT ; microarray analysis may reveal secreted protein may use `` biomarkers '' IFNε activity .</detailed_description>
