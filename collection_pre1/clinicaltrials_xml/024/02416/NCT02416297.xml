	<brief_summary>The purpose research study assess clinical effectiveness minimally invasive alveolar microperforation procedure achieve accelerate tooth movement patient undergoing orthodontic treatment orthognathic surgery . `` Accelerated tooth movement '' mean Microperforation technique may help complete orthodontic treatment sooner would expect conventional orthodontic treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three- Dimensional Evaluation Accelerated Tooth Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SAMPLE : For retrospective study , 50 individual select , skeletal discrepancy randomly divide two group : 1 - accelerate tooth movement technique ( ATMT ) 2 - Control . METHODS : MATERIAL - Orthodontic record do two time , initial preoperative ; Plaster model dental extract jaw every 28 day ; Cone Beam Computed tomography do two time , initial end extraction space closure . METHODS : Orthodontic Treatment : activate extraction space closure , light orthodontic traction make anterior teeth , maintain therapeutic osteopenia contact point canine second pre -molar . Cortical perforation - ATMT Group : Flapless cortical perforation make dental extraction . Surgical protocol flapless preserve periodontal health . After local anesthesia , minimum cortical perforation do manual instrument , 4-6 mm apical contour free gum canine second pre-molar . Two perforation near tooth adjacent extraction area . Results : On plaster model - short distance two adjacent teeth extraction space measure caliper . Cone-Beam Computed Tomography : image acquisition , data previously convert DICOM , convert GIPL ITK-SNAP 3.2 software . In Imagine software voxels convert size 0.5 mm construction virtual three-dimensional model , segmentation anatomical structure ITK-SNAP 3.2 software . This segmentation make full selection maxilla mandible anatomically individually , limit skeletal outline available , include teeth . After 3D model generation , specific control target fill narrow space , exclude virtual model external cortical displacement one compute comparative evaluation later time . Then regional overlay 3D model do use Imagine software . For overlap structure : In mandible use along edge mandibular symphysis ; maxilla , posterior nasal spine . Overlap automatic software compare voxels grayscale reference region overlap spatially . Displacement evaluation do Mirit software colorful map generate calculate distance point two representative surface . These map differentiate movement surface . For quantification metric , specific online tool use measure displacement millimeter . We evaluate quantitative displacement space closure , close speed , possible change throughout maxillomandibular complex compare group . Ossification area volume compare use Hounsfield scale . After collect data , result statistically analyze .</detailed_description>
