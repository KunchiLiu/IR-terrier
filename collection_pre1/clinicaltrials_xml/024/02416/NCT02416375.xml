	<brief_title>Home Monitoring Predict Exacerbation Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants collect follow clinical information daily : pulse rate oxygen saturation , wellness cough score , spirometry measurement , physical activity , temperature , weight sleep quantity quality . The patient also collect daily sputum sample . Data collect via Bluetooth-enabled device transmit via Smart-phone secure National Health Service approve web-based site analyze . The information obtain allow investigator develop software program identify signal predict onset chest infection symptom develop . The investigator also measure specific substance sputum identify change , chest infection . The investigator hope additional information enable accurately predict onset chest infection cystic fibrosis . The result study determine possible develop simple sputum test patient use home combination home-based assessment well-being provide early warning system chest infection patient feel unwell .</detailed_description>
