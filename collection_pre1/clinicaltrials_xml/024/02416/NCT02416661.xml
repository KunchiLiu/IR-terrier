	<detailed_description>Gaucher disease autosomal recessive inherit lysosomal storage disorder . The disease cause hereditary deficiency glucocerebrosidase , lysosomal enzyme break glucocerebroside glucose ceramide . Gaucher disease common sphingolipidosis among frequent inherit disease among ethnic group Ashkenazi Jews . The gene encode glucocerebrosidase locate long arm chromosome 1 contain 11 exon . So far , 400 different mutation describe Gaucher patient , frequent missense mutation also frame-shift splice-site mutation insertion deletion know . The frequent mutation N370S , L444P , IVS2+1G &gt; A , c.84insG , R463C , R496H . Clinical symptom numerous . The classical symptom affect visceral organ ( hepatosplenomegaly ) skeletal system ( bone marrow infiltration bone infarcts pathological fracture ) consecutive change blood panel ( anemia , thrombocytopenia ) ( Sidransky , 2004 ) .A major distinguish factor occurrence neurological manifestation ( myoclonus epilepsy , hydrocephalus , eye motion disorder ) . Today , discuss whether division classical three type disease ( type 1 : non-neuronopathic form ; type 2 : acute neuronopathic form ; type 3 : chronic neuronopathic form ) still applicable clinical practice present symptom insufficiently reflect classification . There clear genotype-phenotype relationship . The DNA mutation see patient completely different characterization disease . An exception mutation N370S , far found visceral form ( type1 ) , still may high phenotypic heterogeneity GD Type 1 ( Fairley et al. , 2008 ) . The outcome non-neuronopathic disease could improve greatly introduction widely available enzyme replacement therapy . Among reduction size liver spleen well normalization blood count ( Elstein Zimran , 2009 ) . The glucocerebrosides metabolize stored entire reticuloendothelial system . The macrophage enrich glycolipids form pathoanatomic basis so-called `` Gaucher cell '' verify light microscope . The accumulation Gaucher cell liver , spleen , bone marrow think underlie characteristic hepatosplenomegaly , pancytopenia bone complication GD patient ( Beutler 2001 ) . There causative cure lysosomal storage disease treatment mostly symptomatic , although mostly enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) demonstrate especially treatment non-neuronopathic GD good success ( Elstein Zimran , 2009 ) . In addition , substrate reduction therapy ( SRT ) , method use decrease accumulation storage material , currently evaluate disease . In SRT , oral administration iminosugar N-butyldeoxynojirimycin aim reduce Glucosylceramide ( GlcCer ) synthesis thus limit accumulation . However , SRT approve mildly tomoderately affected patient ERT therapeutic option ( Ficicioglu , 2008 ) . Additionally , Eliglustat currently investigation primary oral treatment GD type 1 patient ( Lukina et al. , 2014 ) . To date definitive diagnosis Gaucher 's disease make apply biochemical testing measuring reduce enzymatic activity beta-glucosidase together genetic confirmation . Since numerous different mutation may cause particular lysosomal storage disease sequence entire beta-glucosidase gene apply Gaucher 's disease order confirm genetic diagnosis ( Zimran , 2011 ) . Although attempt apply easy diagnostic method base associated biochemical abnormality high alkaline phosphatase , angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) immunoglobulin level , , case Gaucher 's disease , cell analysis show `` crinkled paper '' cytoplasm glycolipid-laden macrophage , unmet need simple biochemical test exhibit highly specific highly sensitive detection early stage , monitor progression disease early monitoring efficacy applied therapy . A biomarker technically feasible many hand , easy measure ; useful , consistent , relative magnitude patient control , treat untreated patient ; reliable , precise , accurate clinically , classifiable strongly predictive prognostic . In GD lysosomal enzyme , use indirect biomarkers , find elevate , include tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase , hexosaminidase , human chitinase , chitotriosidase . Thus , attempt monitor reduction storage cell tissue measurement surrogate marker Gaucher cell like chitotriosidase CCL18 ( Hollak et al. , 1994 ; Boot et al. , 2004 ) . However , use plasma chitotriosidase Gaucher cell marker hamper fact patient , include Gaucher 's disease , may deficient chitotriosidase activity due 24-base pair ( bp ) duplication chitotriosidase gene . Obviously individual monitor measurement plasma chitotriosidase activity . The frequency homozygous 24-bp duplication chitotriosidase gene depend ethnicity vary 6 % nearly 35 % Latino population ( unpublished data ) . In case marker CCL18 use . Furthermore , elevate level CCL18 also find associate variety disease , different type cancer inflammation joint , lung skin . For example , ascitic fluid patient suffer ovarian cancer contain significantly elevate level CCL18 compare patient without carcinoma ( Budd-Chiari syndrome ) . Since attracts activates specific immune cell CCL18 play role tumor suppression . Furthermore , child acute lymphocytic leukemia find exhibit elevated level CCL18 . Plasma CCL18 level reflect one particular clinical symptom , rather reflection total body burden Gaucher cell . The use primary storage molecule biomarker assess glucosylceramide ( Gb1 ) plasma Gaucher 's disease patient compare level Gb1 healthy individual ( Groener et al . 2008 ) . Already 1989 Rosengren et al . ( 1989 ) show lipidoses catabolism major sphingolipid also deacylated compound affect . It important note today use highly specific highly sensitive biomarker routinely use beside method describe , exhibit unsatisfactory limit detection , sensitivity and/or specificity thus prove unsuitable clinical application</detailed_description>
