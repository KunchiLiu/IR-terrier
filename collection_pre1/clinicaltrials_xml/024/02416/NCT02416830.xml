	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Purpose : The purpose cohort post market registry collect data create global database use embolization device embolization procedures outcome . The data collect cohort serve scientific purpose acquire good insight embolization procedure . This achieved publication Scientific Journals presentation scientific meeting . Additionally support industry create well overview product use maintain enhance clinical efficacy use device . The cohort post market registry represent novel approach way allow Clinicians generate report base evolve control well organize database . Hypothesis : Transcatheter Embolization recognize primary treatment various disease viable alternative exist treatment option . Further Registry foster generation Consensus Treatment Documents benefit Clinicians involve Transcatheter Embolization . Further Registry increase level Transcatheter Embolization function Clinicians get access data generate Registry . Embolization indication : The current set-up registry focus embolization treatment visceral arterial aneurysm . In future additional indication embolization add scope study . Significance scientific field : A key opinion leader field Interventional Radiology ( IR ) , , identify need provide improved clinical evidence embolization procedure . There several factor potentially explain today 's limited evidence include : - rapidly evolve technology , - absence consensus clinical indications/interventional strategy , - small sample size term number cases/centre/year ; - lack support university/public funding resource well industry , - low level require qualification/certification device company commercialization process embolization devices/technologies All element concurrent toward need facilitate independent , high quality , evaluation clinical outcome embolization widespread spectrum application result publication high scientific value significance healthcare system . Registry overview : A prospective , multi-center , non-randomized cohort registry collect data technical clinical outcome embolization procedure participate center standard care basis . Duration registry : The estimate duration registry approximately 5 year time first subject enrollment . Subjects follow accord standard care procedures participate center . Number sit subject : No limitation set number participate site subject . The participate site grant participation approval one co-principal investigator . Participating investigator : For physician clinical centre able participate study approve founder , Marc Sapoval , M.D PhD ( Doctor Philosophy ) Jafar Golzarian , MD John Kaufman M.D . The founder name group expert lead principal investigator ( LPI ) represent founder registry . Only center physician facility expertise require study participate study . All participate center must sign EmboCoH Charter order participate . EmboCoH non profit organization found Marc Sapoval Jafar Golzarian . Data Management Quality Assurance : The select platform e-capture.net . This platform property e-novex . e-novex offer secure innovative solution enhance conduct e-clinical trial compliance different regulation . e-novex ISO9001 ISO27001 certify , ISO International Organization Standardization . The platform Code Federal Regulations Title 21 , part 11 ( 21 CFR , part 11 ) compliant . Publications Sharing Data : Publications review Steering Committee prior submission publication . EmboCoH encourage drive publication Journals Scientific Meetings . EmboCoH lead formation Consensus Documents base Clinical Outcomes database . Contact information : Organizational lead : EmboCoH 17010 40th Place N. Plymouth , MN 55446 ( Minnesota ) USA EmboCoH non Profit Organization . Project management : Gert Andersen gert @ transmedicalalliance.com Mob : +45 23 600 650 REGISTRY METHODOLOGY Registry design : This prospective , multi-center , non-randomized registry . All consecutive subject eligible embolization visceral aneurysm may include registry . Additional indication embolization may add scope course registry . Purpose registry : The purpose registry provide worldwide therapeutic embolization data base provide data evidence field IR focus embolization oncology . The data publish share select medical industry professional . Primary objective : The primary objective collection initial embolization procedure result define target vessel lesion occlusion clinical success . Secondary objective : The secondary objective collect organ specific procedural result outcome . General inclusion data : Subjects must meet follow criterion order participate within study : - Eligible embolization define within scope study . - Subject ( subject 's legally authorize representative ) able willing sign data protection form applicable . Subject screen &amp; selection : No specific screen protocol applicable cohort registry . Assessment patient eligibility perform per standard care perform base data available investigator time subject enrollment . Procedure data collection requirement All available data initial embolization procedure organ specific procedure collect electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) . Follow-up visit data collection : All subject clinically followed-up per standard care participate hospital assess clinical success maintain , evaluate current health status whether re-intervention occur . Imaging follow-up include appropriate per standard care . It recommend patient come follow-up visit one ( 1 ) , six ( 6 ) 12 month visceral aneurysm . Regulatory Institutional approval : The platform consider non-interventional registry . No formal investigational plan create , however available data centrally store outside hospital therefore must compliant national local regulation . It responsibility involve center verify local requirement prior participation . It strongly recommend use write consent form , approve relevant institutional review board ethical committee confirms approval patient store anonymous data centrally . The select platform compliant overall data protection regulation . Personal access grant approval Project Management . Termination participation : All subject right terminate participation point study .</detailed_description>
