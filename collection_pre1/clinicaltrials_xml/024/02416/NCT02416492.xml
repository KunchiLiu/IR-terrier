	<brief_summary>The primary purpose clinical study evaluate clinical efficacy intracranial administration SB623 cell patient chronic motor deficit Traumatic Brain Injury . A secondary purpose study 1 ) evaluate effect intracranial administration SB623 cell disability parameter 2 ) evaluate safety tolerability intracranial administration SB623 cell . Patients stable , chronic motor deficit secondary focal traumatic brain injury must 12 month post TBI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SB623 cell adult bone-marrow-derived cell transiently transfected plasmid construct encode intracellular domain human Notch-1 . These cell produce trophic factor protect neuron model ischemic insult . In rat contusion model TBI , implantation SB623 around area injury result significant improvement motor function . Further , safety evaluation animal model implant SB623 cell show adverse effect SB623-related clinical , laboratory , histological abnormality find . A Phase 1/2A dose escalation study ( NCT01287936 ) SB623 stereotactically implant brain patient chronic motor deficit due ischemic stroke fully enrol , patient follow 18 month post-infarct . This study show statistically-significant improvement motor function three scale : European Stroke Scale ( ESS ) , National Institute Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) Fugl-Meyer scale . To date , study also show serious adverse event attribute SB623 , minor adverse event mostly grade 1 2 ( one grade 3 ) unrelated , unlikely relate , possibly relate SB623 . No dose-limiting toxicity observe .</detailed_description>
