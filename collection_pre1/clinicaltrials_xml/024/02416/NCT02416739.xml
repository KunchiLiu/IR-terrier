	<brief_summary>Nicotinamide inhibitor human sirtuins ( HDAC III ) , find re-activate epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor , RUNX3 ( runt-related gene 3 ) others , cancer cell . Nicotinamide find effective several animal cancer model include lung , bladder , liver , etc . The purpose study determine whether nicotinamide also effective treatment human lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The standard therapy EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) mutation positive non-small-cell lung cancer patient eligible operation administer EGFR-TKIs ( tyrosine kinase inhibitor , gefitinib erlotinib ) . To determine effectiveness nicotinamide lung cancer , nicotinamide placebo tablet co-administered gefitinib erlotinib two year event censoring occur . The stratified block randomization design 3 covariates ( EGFR mutation status , kind EGFR-TKI , ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status score variation ) . The size lesion check every month radiology . PD ( progressive disease ) assess accord RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) 1.1 . After observe 36 event , interim analysis hazard ratio Cox proportional hazard regression perform . The final analysis do protocol observation 72 event . The significance level interim final analysis set 0.0075 0.0209 respectively . Response rate , quality life ( measure 10 question every visit ) , overall survival analyse together . All adverse reaction analyse report , .</detailed_description>
