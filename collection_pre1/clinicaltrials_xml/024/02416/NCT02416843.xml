	<brief_summary>Overweight obesity major problem complication cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes mellitus pose great burden healthcare system . There accumulate evidence support obesity chronic inflammatory disorder mediate part expansion adipose ( fat ) tissue . Knowledge role adipose tissue change dramatically emerge addition store energy fats; adipose tissue secretes respond various chemical messenger body related metabolism inflammation . After meal consume , change metabolic ( inflammatory ) marker see blood , may influence metabolic inflammatory change occur adipose tissue . The investigator therefore plan investigate change adipose tissue meal compare change occur blood . They also plan investigate whether response different people overweight compare 'normal ' weight . Participants include male age 35-55 year fit criterion inclusion . After take preliminary measurement monitor normal daily activity , participant attend one day Laboratory test Physiology Laboratories University Bath . By investigate difference metabolism inflammation adipose tissue circulation hop learnt development disease associate overweight ultimately help develop effective method prevention treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim research investigate difference metabolism inflammation adipose tissue circulation response meal increase adiposity . It hypothesise participant increase fat mass , pronounce inflammatory response meal compare participant 'healthy ' weight . The inflammatory response assess measuring change gene expression protein secretion adipose tissue measure marker metabolism , insulin resistance , cardiovascular disease inflammation blood . Following advertisement study , interested potential participant ask contact Chief Investigator information via email/telephone correspondence . There initial assessment eligibility base inclusion/exclusion criterion , requirement meet , potential participant invite meeting discuss trial . After read participant information sheet see flowchart outline timeline study , would like take part , ask sign consent form . Dates schedule preliminary anthropometric measurement take , 9 day physical activity monitor trial date ( 1 full day laboratory ) . Preliminary measurement : Preliminary test include anthropometric measurement height , weight , waist hip circumference , sagittal waist height blood pressure . These measurement take place University Bath Physiology Laboratories . Physical activity monitoring : For 9 day , participant fit physical activity monitor ( Actiheart™ ) ask record correspond diary physical activity period aid interpretation allow accurate calculation average daily activity energy expenditure . Participants make conscious change normal lifestyle habits/routines period . The first 2 day activity monitoring exclude analysis account reactivity . Main trial day : In 3 day prior main trial day , participant ask record food drink intake 48 hour refrain perform strenuous physical activity . In 24 hour prior participant also refrain consume alcohol caffeine . Participants arrive Sports Training Village , University Bath morning follow 10 hour fast body composition precisely assess use dual-energy Xray absorptiometer ( DEXA ) . They take Physiology Resting Laboratory baseline expire gas collect assessment rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) . A cannula insert forearm vein baseline blood sample ( ) take analysis metabolic/inflammatory marker isolation T cell . A fat sample also obtain use needle aspiration technique . The participant ask consume breakfast type meal high carbohydrate fat content consist brioche , jam , butter , milkshake adapt meal use Rijkelijkhuizen J. et al , 2008 , induce strong beta cell response ( i.e . insulin ) compare glucose load show difference insulin sensitivity , meal type identify difference metabolism base adiposity . Furthermore , evidence high starch/low fibre food may induce great inflammation ( Manning , Sutherland et al . 2008 ) . The meal composition individual identical energy content carbohydrate calculate portion individual ' rest metabolic rate . This allow standardisation energy intake difference body weight/composition reflect energy requirement individual whilst rest . The meal consume within 15 minute blood sample take cannula 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 minute every hour 6 hour consumption meal monitor change metabolic inflammatory marker . Additional blood sample obtain 2 6 hour post meal venepuncture analysis inflammatory marker evidence cannula stimulate local inflammation interfere true result . Expired gas sample RMR also take hourly indirect calorimetry use estimate relative fat carbohydrate metabolism response meal . A second fat sample take 6 hour examine inflammatory metabolic response meal within adipose tissue . A second blood sample T cell isolation also obtain time point examine correspond metabolic/inflammatory response T cell . Analysis : On day trial whole blood analyse white blood cell count , glucose lactate . Plasma serum sample extract whole blood via centrifugation store −80 . Monocytes T lymphocytes ( population white blood cell ) also isolated whole blood later assessment insulin sensitivity culture experiment . In fat sample , separate portion either adipose tissue adipocytes ( isolated cell within adipose tissue use digestion method ) culture medium collect late investigation . mRNA expression also examine adipose tissue isolate adipocytes . The remain cell adipose tissue ( SVF ) also store later analysis cell population use flow cytometry , expression/secretion analysis .</detailed_description>
