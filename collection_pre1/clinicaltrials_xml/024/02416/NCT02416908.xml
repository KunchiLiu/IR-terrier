	<brief_summary>Selinexor show single-agent activity current phase I study enrol patient relapsed/refractory AML durable complete remission ( CR ) , complete remission incomplete hematologic recovery ( CRi ) , partial remission ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) observe . Furthermore , common toxicity include nausea , fatigue , anorexia manageable supportive care agent . Additionally , CLAG chemotherapy proven activity relapse refractory AML , show relatively well tolerated regimen without significant non-hematologic toxicity . Given establish role CLAG chemotherapy , single agent activity selinexor , non-overlapping toxicity , investigator propose phase I/II open label study selinexor combination CLAG treatment patient relapsed/refractory AML .</brief_summary>
