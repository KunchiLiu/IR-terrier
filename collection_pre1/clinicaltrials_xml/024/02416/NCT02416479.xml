	<brief_title>SystemCHANGE : An Intervention Medication Change Adult Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS For adult kidney transplant ( KT ) patient , lead predictor rejection , kidney loss , death attendant cost immunosuppressive medication nonadherence ( MNA ) . An alarm one-third KT recipient experience preventable problem . According meta-analysis , predictor MNA nonwhite ethnicity , poorer social support poorer perceive health . Patients ' frequent barrier adhere immunosuppressive medication forgetting . 9 Even minor deviation adherence show negative effect , though precise extent poor outcome stem nonadherence clear . Traditionally , intervention study aim boost adherence target cognition ( knowledge , attitude , belief ) behavioral skill . However , proven marginally effective individual acute chronic illness ineffective adult KT recipient . In sample KT recipient , propose test innovative successful SystemCHANGE intervention , ground socio-ecological model . This approach paradigm shift behavioral intervention seek redesign system interpersonal environment daily routine link health behavior , rather alter individual ' effort change behavior . Using four-pronged , patient-centered approach , ( 1 ) ass individual system ( include important others shape medication taking ) , influence medication take proposal improve medication adherence , ( 2 ) implement propose individual system solution improve adherence , ( 3 ) track adherence data , ( 4 ) evaluate adherence data small experiment . In pilot study , intervention yield large effect size 1.4 . This study 's innovation lie use socio-ecological model know SystemCHANGE , differs greatly previous cognitive behavioral skills-focused intervention improve medication adherence . This first rigorous evaluation SystemCHANGE diverse sample KT recipients long-term follow . This study present unique opportunity evaluate moderator mediator adherence potential , base upon pilot work , immediate `` dose '' impact . As , could hold great promise intervention translates well practice setting . Our 6-month SystemCHANGE intervention ( also refer `` intervention '' ) seek enhance adherence immunosuppressive medication among adult KT recipient non-adherent . The study randomize control trial attention-control intervention ( also refer `` control '' ) determine persistence medication adherence behavior change difference adherence two group 6-month maintenance phase . Primary Aim ( PA ) : PA : To determine whether intervention effective control increase medication adherence adult KT recipient completion intervention maintenance phase . Hypothesis : Adult KT recipient participate intervention higher immunosuppressive adherence rate participate control completion intervention maintenance phase . Secondary Aim ( Sec ) : SA : To examine pattern medication adherence adult KT recipients group . Research question ( RQ ) : When intervention become effective ( e.g. , `` dose '' need ) ? RQ : What pattern decay adherence time group ? Exploratory Aims ( EA ) : EA1 : To determine whether intervention effective control decrease poor health outcome ( e.g . increase creatinine/BUN , infection , acute/chronic rejection , graft loss , death , hospitalization , length hospital stay , healthcare appointment ) . Hypothesis : At one year , differential level poor outcome , intervention demonstrate low level poor outcome control . EA2 : To evaluate role potential mediator moderator medication adherence health outcome adult KT recipient intervention control . Hypothesis : Incorporating potential mediator moderator intervention ( e.g. , nonwhite ethnicity , perceive social support , perceive health status , personal system behavior ) increase medication adherence variance explain intervention . EA3 : To determine intervention cost-effective . Hypothesis : The cost-effectiveness ratio intervention less control . Each year , 35.6 KT recipient per 100 non-adherent medication , primary cause post-transplant morbidity . Thus , need effective intervention compelling : Decreasing transplant complication MNA reduce cost make additional kidney available wait transplant reduce number KT recipient must rejoin organ list . This project build research team 's previous adherence work , include SystemCHANGE intervention pilot study address Healthy People 2020 initiatives reduce chronic kidney disease complication , disability , death , cost optimize transplant medication adherence increase number patient receive transplant .</detailed_description>
