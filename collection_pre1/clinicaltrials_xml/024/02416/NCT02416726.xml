	<brief_summary>The objective study compare gene mutation status among primary tumor , match metastatic lymph node ( LN ) peripheral blood advance nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) use next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Gene Mutations Matched Samples Advanced Nonsquamous NSCLC Using NGS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many gene mutation detect lung cancer , might differ primary tumor metastases patient . One may cause heterogenicity tumor , another may cause sensitivity detection technique . So determine use NGS , sensitive technique , detect different gene mutation among primary tumor , metastatic LN peripheral blood advance nonsquamous NSCLC . The study design prospective single center study . Thirty five patient enrol study clinical data patient , include smoke history , cancer history , occupation exposure , collect record case report form . For patient recruit study , primary tumor metastatic lymph node obtain interventional pulmonology technology . And 10ml peripheral blood collect time . The tissue send Pathology Department Shanghai Chest Hospital process paraffin-embedded , diagnose nonsquamous NSCLC , rest tissue extract DNA perform NGS qualify DNA sample use Illumina Nextseq500 sequencer.The match peripheral blood also extract DNA perform NGS use Illumina Nextseq500 sequencer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients suspect nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer accord clinical , lab examination image data never diagnose primary lung cancer enrol study . 2 . The clinical stage patient stage IIIAIV judge image data ca n't receive surgery initially , 3 . There exist least one primary tumor least one enlarge LN biopsied minimally invasive technique . 1 . The patient highly suspect benign lesion , small cell lung cancer squamous cell carcinoma accord clinical data . 2 . Surgery consider primary treatment . 3 . Patients diagnose lung cancer receive treatment drug recurrent lung cancer exclude .</criteria>
