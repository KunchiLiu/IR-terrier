	<brief_summary>Digital ( finger ) ulcer common patient systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) cause much pain affect patient use hand . Our current treatment digital ulcer often effective may significant side effect ( increase blood flow ulcer try help heal ) . Light-based treatment successfully use treat chronic diabetic , pressure venous ulcer . The investigator wish investigate whether light-based treatment safe effective treatment digital ulcer patient SSc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design This open pilot study : participant receive light-based treatment ( visit 1-6 inclusive ) . Ten participant least one digital ulcer ( one digital ulcer may assess study locate hand ) recruit . Justification sample size There pilot data inform power calculation . Paired measurement 10 participant give 90 % power detect clinically meaningful change VAS 2 point 5 % significance level , provide observed standard deviation pair difference 1.7 less . If observed standard deviation 2.0 , sample size give 80 % power detect change state significance level . Methods data collection Study visit schedule Participants attend total 8 study visit two month . Light treatment administer twice weekly three week ( i.e . first 6 study visit ) . Follow-up visit 1 month ( visit 7 ) 2 month ( visit 8 ) . Preparation Participants ask abstain caffeine-containing drink smoke least 4 hour prior study . Sterile gauze and/or water may use investigator ( use glove ) clean surface wound debris could potentially interfere light-based treatment . Application light-based device digital ulcer Both participant investigator wear appropriate safety goggles ( advised Medical Physics Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust [ SRFT ] ) time whilst light-based device operation . The participant place hand within treatment area light-based device ( total treatment area approximately 15cm2 ) , aim centralise digital ulcer/s centre treatment region . The device control custom-built computer interface . At study visit , device undergo period ( automatic ) calibration use . All three wavelength ( red , infrared blue ) deliver simultaneously combination , fluence device set [ 3J/cm2 ] ( treatment duration approximately 10 15 minute ) . Performance data light-based treatment ( include total dose deliver performance LEDs record . In event catastrophic failure device ( e.g . failure multiple LEDs ) , device automatically shut . Participant investigator assessment feasibility Participant investigator opinion feasibility light-based treatment record ( end first last treatment study visit ) . Participant investigator assessment tolerability Participant investigator opinion tolerability light-based treatment record ( end first last treatment study visit ) . Participant investigator opinion Participant investigator global assessment digital ulcer perform visual analogue scale ( 0-10 , 10 severe ) study visit . A clinical photograph ( see immediately ) independently score later date another investigator . Clinical Photography The Clinical Photography department SRFT take photograph digital ulcer/s end study visit . High-frequency ultrasound ( HFUS ) Will perform immediately investigator light-treatment deliver follow visit . The investigator perform two 'scans ' along short long axis ulcer use make measurement ( basal superficial width/length volume ) . Laser Doppler imaging ( LDI ) Will perform investigator immediately directly treatment ( digital ulcer site correspond contralateral arm position ) visit measure ulcer perfusion .</detailed_description>
