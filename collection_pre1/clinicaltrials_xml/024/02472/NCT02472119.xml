	<detailed_description>Celiac disease one common form food intolerance ( prevalence 1/200 ) . The disease occur genetically predispose individual ingestion food contain wheat gluten similar protein find common cereal barley rye . Celiac patient suffer severe malabsorption syndrome , mainly characterize diarrhea , weight loss growth retardation . The therapeutic approach currently recognize life-long gluten-free diet . Specific region gluten molecule become recognizable lymphocyte activate , due change make tissue transglutaminase . These change consist conversion specific residue glutamine ( Q ) glutamic acid ( E ) . The consequence increase bind affinity gluten histocompatibility molecule ( HLA-DQ2 ) , localize surface `` antigen presenting cell '' ( APC ) ; exposure fragment modify gluten surface APC phenomenon eventually activate T lymphocyte . Recent study modify gluten confirm hypothesis possible block presentation gluten lymphocytes mean lysine ethyl ester bind exclusively gluten region responsible lymphocyte activation . Specifically , possible perform enzymatic treatment directly flour instead extracted gluten , maintain anti-inflammatory effectiveness . The final procedure consist dissolve flour water presence appropriate concentration enzyme lysine ethyl ester , maintain suspension constant motion two hour room temperature . The procedure use food-grade enzyme , microbial transglutaminase ( mTGasi ) isolate Streptoverticillium mobarensis , already use preparation food . The mTgasi able catalyze formation intermolecular `` cross-link '' modify functional property product aggregation polymerization protein . The peculiar method identify laboratory reduces possibility cross-links protein : consequently , minimal change involve gluten structure , consequently , visco-elastic property dough . Objective study validate ability enzyme treatment wheat flour mTGasi lysine ethyl ester block toxic effect gluten celiac patient .</detailed_description>
