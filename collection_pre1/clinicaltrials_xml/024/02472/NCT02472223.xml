	<brief_summary>The primary aim pilot study generate data need design definitive trial compare safety efficacy standard care artificial tear vs. Betadine 5 % ( 5 % povidone-iodine ) treatment pink eye due adenovirus . There currently FDA approve treatment pink eye , common highly contagious eye infection cause adenovirus . Standard care recommend American Academy Ophthalmology American Optometric Association instillation artificial tear relieve symptom possibly reduce virus population . Betadine 5 % commercially available , broad-spectrum antiseptic ophthalmic solution use 50 year prepare patient 's eye surround area eye surgery . Because Betadine 5 % kill bacteria virus , may useful treat adenoviral conjunctivitis . Betadine 5 % inexpensive , safe , widely available , immune development bacterial/viral resistance . Betadine 5 % potential significantly impact clinical management `` pink eye '' worldwide . This pilot study receive funding National Eye Institute . Participants meet eligibility criterion randomize use mask randomization packet receive one-time , in-office treatment either artificial tear Betadine 5 % . Patients agree study participation answer question pink eye symptom , medical ocular history , eye examination test confirm `` pink eye '' due adenovirus use FDA approve `` point care '' immunoassay . Participants test positive adenovirus tear sample take measure viral load qPCR . Randomization one-time treatment either ( standard care ) artificial tear Betadine 5 % do first visit . Follow-up visit 1,4,7,14 21 day . At visit , symptom pink eye ask , standardize study eye examination give mask clinician sample tear take assess viral load qPCR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To determine specificity AdenoPlus ( TM ) `` point care '' immunoassay strip perform diagnose presence adenovirus compare qPCR testing . Aim 2 : To determine percentage participant stay study 21 day , rate reduction clinical sign , patient report symptom adenovirus measure qPCR . Aim 3 : To examine relationship amount adenovirus measure tear qPCR , clinical sign patient-reported symptom . `` Pink eye '' ( adenovirus conjunctivitis Ad-Cs ) common ocular condition , afflict patient comprise much 2 % general practitioner 's practice . Partly due ability adenovirus remain infectious desiccated state week room temperature , Ad-Cs contagious form conjunctivitis spread via ocular respiratory secretion . Owing highly contagious nature condition , Ad-Cs outbreaks occur people congregate : school , military unit , nurse home , workplace , community health-care facility . With respect latter , nosocomial spread condition significant public health issue 17 % 145 case , 44 % 192 case 85 % 132 case report originate place eye examination . The infection spread first affect eye fellow eye majority patient , secondary transmission viral conjunctivitis member household estimate occur rate 20 % . Outbreaks Ad-Cs spare nationality , age , gender social class epidemic potential adenoviral serotypes , Ad-Cs reportable condition Germany Japan . A treatment decrease duration infectious period could substantial impact reduce spread Ad-Cs outbreak . To insure timely completion recruitment , especially since outbreaks seasonal episodic , study recruit 6 participate clinical site nationally . To attain overall sample target 50 randomized patient , 200 pt pink eye need screen . Each clinic screen 30-40 patient randomize 8-10 12 month period . Patients present presumed acute Ad-Cs , 19 year age old report symptom onset 4 day less first affect eye invite undergo eligibility screening . Over 12 month recruitment period , 6 Clinical Centers screen least 200 patient present presumed Ad-Cs , enroll 50 eligible patient . Of 6 Clinics , 4 Optometry department - Illinois College Optometry , Ohio State University , Northeastern State University University Alabama Birmingham 2 Clinics Ophthalmology departments- University Illinois Washington University School Medicine . These clinic provide geographic diversity multi-ethnic representation ( include African American , Asian , Caucasian , Hispanic Native American group ) . Because patient pink eye likely see optometrist ophthalmologist , PI 's Clinics optometrist . Patients consent participation : - Participant complete eligibility screen 30 minute - confirmation age symptom duration , symptom survey , eye examination ; - AdenoPlus ( TM ) test confirm adenoviral conjunctivitis ( Screening/Baseline Form ) ; - Participants test positive AdenoPlus ( TM ) `` fully eligible '' tear sample take qPCR test . Fully eligible participant - Will randomize use mask packet identify serial number contain randomize treatment either artificial tear Betadine 5 % ; - `` Treating '' unmasked study certify clinician administer treatment randomize ; - Participants rate discomfort treatment ass treatment tolerability ask guess whether receive artificial tear Betadine 5 % . Follow-up visit schedule 1 , 4 , 7 , 14 21 day treatment . Each follow-up visit 30 minute . - Participants rate discomfort treatment ass treatment tolerability day 1 post treatment ; - Masked clinician/technician ask 10-question pink eye ocular symptom questionnaire ; - Masked clinician perform eye examination ; - Masked clinician/technician take conjunctival tear sample analysis viral load qPCR . - Participants miss f/up visit ask complete symptom checklist telephone secure REDCap data entry . All study-related encounter potential study participant conduct private , closed-door , `` Red Eye '' examination room clinical center . All study certify personnel ensure patient confidentiality time . The minimum amount information need study collect study participant . All research study data cod clinic site patient ID include personal health data . Personal health data keep physically separate research study data . All data keep HIPAA compliant office space . All study data collect maintain use secure , password protect web-based data capture program ( REDCap ) . The study drug , Betadine 5 % FDA approve topical ocular surface application cornea , conjunctiva palpebral fornix use study recommend dose , age group , duration method application . Risk minimize limit administration single , one-time , in-office application . A study certify optometrist/technician instills artificial tear Betadine 5 % study eye . If immediate untoward reaction , patient fully equip staff eye care facility appropriate expertise treatment available . Participants closely monitor follow-up eye examination 1 , 4 , 7 , 14 21 day treatment . Potential nosocomial infection minimize ask patient use hand sanitizer enter examination room . Patient sign consent form survey administer clinician/technician . We observe strict adherence current CDC disinfection protocol Ad-Cs . Patients report mark symptom withdrawn study manage accord standard clinical care guideline .</detailed_description>
