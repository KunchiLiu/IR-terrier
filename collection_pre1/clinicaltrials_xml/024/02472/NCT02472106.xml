	<brief_summary>This study design monitor safety performance V8 balloon use postdilatation balloon self-expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation ( TAVI ) device procedure . The study product CE mark balloon aortic valvuloplasty ( BAV ) , investigate expand intend use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Postdilatation With InterValve V8 Aortic Valvuloplasty Balloon Following TAVI Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective , multi-center , single arm open-label clinical study involve 5 center minimum 20 subject . Up 50 subject may enrol study . The first 3 post-dilatation procedure investigator consider roll-ins include main study analysis . Subjects exit study hospital discharge 7 day post treatment , whichever come first . The expected duration clinical investigation approximately 6 month . Subjects implant CoreValve commercially available self-expanding TAVI use V8 postdilatation balloon may enrol study . The subject exit study predischarge ECHO Paravalvular Leak ( PVL ) measurements take resolution V8 relate AE ( applicable ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects severe symptomatic aortic stenosis ( AS ) indicate schedule transcatheter aortic valve implant ( TAVI ) Medtronic CoreValve another selfexpanding TAVI device . The TAVI device size determine preoperatively CTA accord standard guideline . Patients may undergo transfemoral , subclavian , transaortic approach . Balloon postdilatation ( BPD ) carry CoreValve selfexpanding TAVI device implantation , base operator 's judgment , BPD indicate presence paravalvular leak ( PVL ) . Hemodynamically stable 3 10 minute TAVI procedure . Probable survival hospital discharge . Subject competent , willing comply evaluation , understands risk , benefit alternative sign Informed Consent Form . Cardiogenic shock , define consistent systolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg vasopressor &lt; 90 mmHg vasopressor . PVL occur secondary excessively high low valve positioning . Trauma significant structural damage underlie native tissue call emergent intervention threaten longterm outcome prior BPD . Patients receive two valve ( i.e . aortic THV valve valve ) . Patients AS secondary congenital valve disease include bicuspid aortic valve . PVL occur due TAVI device size . Example determine undersizing calculate Cover Index represent percent size nominal transcatheter heart valve ( THV ) area compare measure native valve annulus area . Under size define TAVI screen CTA pre procedure cover index area &lt; 5 % . Vulnerable subject subject incapable give consent , include patient incurable disease , patient emergency situation , ethnic minority group , homeless person , nomad , refugee , minor , subject cognitive impairment , person mental illness dementia .</criteria>
