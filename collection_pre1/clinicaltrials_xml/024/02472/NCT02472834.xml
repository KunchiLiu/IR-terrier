	<brief_summary>Patients end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) usually high level urea may interact blood protein change structure process know carbamylation . Evidence suggest high level carbamylated protein may link adverse outcome dialysis patient . This randomized , open-label study evaluate effect amino acid supplementation level carbamylated protein ESRD patient . Secondary objective determine whether intervention modify intermediate marker inflammation , cardiac stress , erythropoietin responsiveness population . Sixty ESRD patient dialysis randomize two group 30 patient . Group 1 receive intravenous supplementation FDA-approved amino acid solution ( 250 mL NephrAmine® , 5.4 % amino acid ) regular dialysis session ( 3 time weekly 8 week ) ; Group 2 treat accord standard-of-care ( amino acid supplementation ) . During 8 week therapy 4 week follow-up , blood drawn patient ' exist hemodialysis access port ( ~20 mL per month ) measure level carbamylated albumin , amino acid , select biomarkers , standard laboratory value . Patients randomize Group 1 fluid volume equivalent amino acid therapy remove ultra-filtration avoid net fluid gain . All patient monitor safety ( adverse event ) change hemodynamics dialysis prescription .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As human kidney function decline , kidney 's ability excrete urea , chief end product nitrogen metabolism . Excess urea may accelerate pathophysiological consequence kidney failure . Urea spontaneously dissociate form cyanate , , unprotonated form react protein amino group process know carbamylation . Carbamylation-induced protein alteration may involve progression various disease change structure , charge , function enzyme , hormone , receptor , amino acid . For example , proteins collagen low density lipoprotein ( LDLs ) , carbamylated , show induce characteristic biochemical event atherosclerosis progression . This research aim evaluate whether amino acid supplementation attenuate process know contribute morbidity patient ESRD . Percent carbamylated albumin ( C-Alb ) level use measure overall carbamylation burden . Previous study conduct MGH Investigators show negative correlation % C-Alb circulating amino acid , suggest free amino acid may actively scavenge reactive isocyanate . Further , ex vivo study show amino acid supplementation reduces carbamylation reaction . The MGH Investigators recently demonstrate association marker cardiac stress , heart failure carbamylation patient ESRD find % C-Alb strongly associate erythropoietin resistance dialysis patient . Additionally , use validated measure total-body carbamylation , Investigators report elevated protein carbamylation link high mortality several distinct ESRD cohort . Finally , preliminary data recent pilot study MGH ( NCT01612429 ) suggest amino acid supplementation patient ESRD undergoing maintenance hemodialysis attenuate carbamylation protein . The propose randomized study directly evaluate impact amino acid supplementation : ( 1 ) burden carbamylation term % C-Alb ; ( 2 ) select intermediate determinant clinical outcome , i.e. , marker inflammation , cardiac stress , erythropoietin responsiveness . A Data Safety Monitoring Board establish review research protocol , safety data study conduct .</detailed_description>
