	<brief_summary>This study evaluate comparison two re-expansion pulmonary physiotherapy patient chest tube . The study group receive intermittent positive pressure intervention control group receive incentive spirometry intervention associate manual operation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Reanimator Muller Patients With Chest Tube</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All re-expansion method increase lung volume increase gradient transpulmonary pressure ( PL ) represent difference alveolar pressure pleural pressure . Spontaneous deep breath increase PL reduce pleural pressure ( active breathing exercise , breathe supporter manual operation ) . Muller resuscitator consist pneumatic valve feature design operate medical oxygen . It use intermittently continuously pulmonary re-expansion , low load impose work , increase efficiency gas exchange improve volume , lung capacity breathing pattern , reverse atelectasis . However , study show paucity data literature regard Muller Resuscitator different form respiratory rehabilitation protocol . In addition , study show lack standardization method resource use respiratory therapy patient chest tube .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients old 18 year untill 65 year Patients undergo thoracic drainage That include exclusion criterion Contraindications breathe equipment use positive pressure Patient intolerance Phobia Hemodynamic instability Use vasopressiva therapy Shock ( systolic pressure &lt; 90 mmHg ) Face trauma Nausea vomit Acute myocardial infarction Lobectomy Lung cancer Gastrointestinal surgery Pleural fistula .</criteria>
