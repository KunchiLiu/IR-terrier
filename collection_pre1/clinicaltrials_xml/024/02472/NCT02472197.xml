	<brief_summary>Intrauterine pathology currently treat hysteroscopic resection . In surgical procedure , intrauterine pathology resect transcervical approach several fragment use mono bipolar cove distension uterine cavity endoscopic control . The main risk surgery : uterine perforation OHIA ( operative hysteroscopy intravascular absorption ) syndrome . Hysteroscopic morcellators new intrauterine device , recently appear French market . In comparison classical resectors , morcellators several theoretical advantage : - A small instrument diameter potentially low risk uterine perforation cervical laceration dilatation procedure , - The use physiological serum , eliminate risk neurological toxicity glycine , - The risk electrical accident cancel ( internal external burn due leakage current ) , - A decreased risk air embolism , due absence bubble ' production , - The instrument always visual control , perforation risk active instrument therefore limit , - The vision obscure fragment bubble , - The treatment pre-ostial pathology , always easy classical resection , could facilitate , - absence thermal effect , therefore potentially low endometrial aggression , interesting woman reproductive desire , - Absence chip management , limit entry exit movement uterine cavity , improve vision , reduce infectious traumatic risk , specially uterine perforation air embolism , - Morcellation could preserve tissue histological analysis possible malignancy ( compare technique use heat , coagulation , vaporization ) , - Easy learn comparison time-consuming learn classical hysteroscopic resection , - Generated additional cost could partly amortize reduce operating time complication . It seem useful study new technology . The primary purpose compare time hysteroscopic treatment uterine polyp hysteroscopic morcellator UNIDRIVE S III / DrillCut-X II-GYN-Shaver ( Integrated Bigatti Shaver IBS ) , StorzÂ® , conventional resectoscope . The secondary purpose compare efficiency , complication comfort technique .</brief_summary>
