	<detailed_description>Farm rural youth frequent exposure hazardous noise farm recreationally , increase prevalence noise-induced hearing loss . An estimated 2 million child adolescent young 20 year age expose farm noise hazard farm resident , farm family worker , hire worker , child migrant seasonal worker , farm visitor . This noise exposure begin early age , compound frequent exposure recreational noise ( e.g. , all-terrain vehicle firearm ) . Farm youth also increase prevalence noise-induced hearing loss , permanent irreversible condition negatively impact quality life affect person , well family member . Although primary prevention offer best opportunity success , farm rural youth rarely serve Occupational Safety Health Administration-mandated hearing conservation program . Although previous test limit educational program promote hear conservation among small group farm youth demonstrate short-term increase hear protector use ( intent use ) , impact population limit program reach sustainability . The purpose project test innovative hearing health education program deliver large target group determine effectiveness sustainability program promote hear health among farm rural youth . Specifically , project include : ) interactive Safety Days program alone , b ) interactive Safety Days program follow Internet-based booster , c ) no-intervention control . This test design determine effective sustainable approach hear health education among farm rural youth . Only effective sustainable hearing health education program use hear conservation strategy increase prevent noise-induced hearing loss negative effect high noise exposure , improve quality life high-risk under-served group . This project involve partnership University Michigan School Nursing major farm rural youth safety education organization accomplish project aim . This randomized-controlled trial innovative community- base intervention design determine effective sustainable approach increase youth ' use hearing protection strategy . Results study used inform future research-to-practice study protect health safety farm rural youth . Consistent use hear conservation strategy expect reduce rate noise-induced hearing loss negative effect high noise exposure , improve quality life high-risk underserved group .</detailed_description>
