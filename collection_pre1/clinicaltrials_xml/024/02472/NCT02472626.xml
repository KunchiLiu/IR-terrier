	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid ( CPI-613 ) give together cytarabine daunorubicin hydrochloride see well work treat old patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia . CPI-613 may kill tumor cell turn mitochondrion ( small structure cancer cell find cytoplasm [ fluid surround cell nucleus ] ) . Mitochondria use cancer cell produce energy building block need make tumor cell . By shut mitochondrion , CPI-613 may deprive cancer cell energy supply need survive grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine daunorubicin hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving CPI-613 together cytarabine daunorubicin hydrochloride may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine treatment response addition CPI-613 induction therapy patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety administer CPI-613 propose study regimen . ( Phase I/II ) II . To assess survival endpoint patient receive propose study regimen . ( Phase II ) III . To assess rate allogeneic stem cell transplantation . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid follow phase II study . INDUCTION : Patients receive cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) continuously day 1-7 , daunorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1-3 , 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid IV 2 hour day 3-7 . Patients undergo biopsy day 14 . Patients experience significant residual disease receive cytarabine IV continuously day 1-5 , daunorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1-2 , 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid IV 2 hour day 1-5 . CONSOLIDATION : Beginning 42 day later , patient receive cytarabine IV continuously day 1-16 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid IV 2 hour day 2-6 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients undergo transplant consolidation receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid IV 2 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 14 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
