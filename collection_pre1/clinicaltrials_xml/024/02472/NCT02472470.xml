	<brief_summary>Youth depression debilitate disorder exacts enormous social , economic personal cost . Unfortunately , treatment conventionally use treat adult depression often modest efficacy youth side effect . Thus , tremendous imperative develop new treatment youth depression . Investigators propose examine efficacy short form repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) youth depression examine biological target . This first study examine efficacy short rTMS protocol youth diagnose depression fail respond intolerable antidepressant . If result positive , investigator identify novel treatment may efficacious , good tolerate acceptable treatment youth depression . Finally , identify biological mechanism lead treatment efficacy lead personalize treatment youth depression groundbreaking vi Ã  vi understand mechanism involve illness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Biological Targets Response rTMS Therapy Youth Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high rate depression report youth 16-24 year age youth depression significant source burden individual , family , society . Unfortunately , current treatment ( e.g. , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) , conventionally use treat depression often modest sometimes efficacy youth . Also , accumulate evidence suggest medication may increase suicidal thought adolescent young adult age 24 . In addition pharmacological treatment , cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) use alone combination medication treat depression age group . Although randomize controlled trial practice guideline support use CBT alone CBT antidepressant medication adolescent depression , large minority adolescent respond either treatment approaches.Thus , tremendous imperative develop new treatment youth depression . Investigators propose examine efficacy repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) youth depression . There several reason pursue treatment : 1 ) rTMS apply dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , cortical region implicate pathophysiology depression , safe FDA approve treatment adult medication-resistant depression ; 2 ) Young age suggest good predictor response rTMS treatment ; 3 ) rTMS trial adolescence youth medication resistant depression provide evidence rTMS safe efficacious well tolerate treatment adolescent increase suicidal thought . Additionally , recently rTMS parameter development theta burst stimulation ( i.e. , TBS ) provide compel evidence efficacy less time take administer conventional rTMS , thus lower overall cost increase number patient treat . It imperative research investigate treatment related biological mechanism , increase understanding lead enhance efficacy . Investigators utilize novel powerful vivo brain mapping technique TMS combine electroencephalography ( TMS-EEG ) permit non-invasive assessment inhibitory , connectivity plasticity mechanisms DLPFC . The pathophysiology depression link impairment neural plasticity connectivity neural behavioral inhibition - mechanism measure TMS-EEG maybe change TBS treatment . Therefore , investigate association TBS-related change plasticity , connectivity inhibition may key understand treatment mechanism involve youth depression predictor treatment response disorder . Therefore specific aim study twofold : 1 . To examine efficacy TBS apply DLPFC youth depression , 2 . To identify biological target predictor response TBS apply DLPFC youth depression .</detailed_description>
