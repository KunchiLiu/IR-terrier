	<brief_summary>Radioiodine refractory differentiate thyroid cancer rare tumor therapeutic option limit set . Molecular target therapy recently develop progressive disease demonstrate clinical activity , especially anti-angiogenic agent . For patient contra-indication agent case progression toxicity treatment , chemotherapy usually propose strategy validate prospective data . The investigator propose conduct open single arm phase 2 study evaluate response rate accord RECIST 1.1 GEMOX regimen ( gemcitabine - oxaliplatin combination ) advance radioiodine refractory differentiate thyroid cancer patient anti-angiogenic agent case contra-indication anti-angiogenic therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine - Oxaliplatin Advanced Refractory Thyroid Cancer Patients : Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study efficacy chemotherapy gemcitabine - oxaliplatin combination advance radioiodine refractory differentiate thyroid cancer patient anti-angiogenic agent case contra-indication anti-angiogenic therapy . For refractory thyroid cancer patient , case contra-indication molecular target therapy case progression toxicity treatment , alternative treatment urgently need . Our study could precise cytotoxic agent remain treatment option refractory thyroid cancer molecular target therapy case contra-indication . Numerous clinical trial propose evaluate various molecular target therapy refractory thyroid cancer , either conduct institutional industrial promoter . In contrast , chemotherapy trial lack . As generic actually available gemcitabine oxaliplatin , industrial support expect prospective evaluation chemotherapy regimen need conduct institutional promoter ( `` Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris '' ) , support many French expert team rare tumor network `` '' TUTHYREF '' '' . GEMOX regimen administrate intravenously every two week ambulatory set . The objective study analyse efficacy chemotherapy gemcitabine - oxaliplatin combination advance radioiodine refractory differentiate thyroid cancer patient anti-angiogenic agent case contra-indication anti-angiogenic therapy . The primary end point overall response rate ( complete + partial response - CR+PR ) , accord RECIST 1.1 , assess local investigator 4 month . 30 patient include two step design ( Fleming design ) . A response rate lower 15 % define inefficacy level . Minimal efficacy 35 % response rate . First step : inclusion 15 patient . If 2 less response observe : end study inefficacy If 6 response observe : efficacy endpoint reach If 3 5 response observe , additional inclusion need . Second step : inclusion 15 additional patient . Nine responses expect define positive study . Details present statistical section . The secondary end point : - Safety report accord NCI CTCAE v 4.0 grade scale - Early metabolic response rate 18F-FDG-PET/CT 2 month - Disease control rate ( DCR = CR + PR + SD ) ≥ 6 month - Duration response - Time progression - Progression free survival - Overall survival . - Evolution quality life accord Fact-G EQ-5D ``</detailed_description>
