	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Reactogenicity DPX-RSV ( A ) , Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , First Humans , randomize ( 2:2:1 ) observer blind , control , dose range , multi-arm parallel-group clinical trial healthy person 50 64 year age assess safety immunogenicity two dose level novel vaccine formulation DPX-RSV ( A ) consist synthetic Respiratory Syncytial Virus SHe antigen combine novel adjuvant DepoVaxTM , compare antigen combine commonly use adjuvant Aluminum hydroxide , saline placebo control . The study evaluate two different dos DPX-RSV ( A ) two dos RSV SHe antigen aluminum hydroxide ( RSV ( A ) -Alum ) , placebo control . The study randomize , control , observer-blinded order allocation treatment conceal investigative team participant . The inclusion comparator group ( placebo control group RSV ( A ) -Alum ) allow estimation attributable risk adverse event . Since study vaccine identical appearance , unblinded study nurse role study administer study vaccine .</detailed_description>
