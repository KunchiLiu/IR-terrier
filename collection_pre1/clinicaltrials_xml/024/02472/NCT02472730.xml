	<brief_title>Cap Assisted Colonoscopy Enhances Quality Based Competency Colonoscopy Among Trainees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Training novice endoscopists perform effective diagnostic colonoscopy central objective Gastroenterology fellowship . Though universal definition competency , traditionally assess combination objective measure volume procedure subjective factor formal evaluation . As quality measure cecal intubation time , cecal intubation rate , adenoma detection rate gain importance clinical practice , increasingly incorporated objective formalize objective training methodology . Indeed , though 140 colonoscopy suggest rough volume threshold need trainee gain competence , evidence suggests number may actually much high take various objective quality measure account . Recent attention turn various measure improve trainee performance computer simulation magnetic endoscopy imaging . Along line , simple , effective , economical measure need improve trainee performance . Cap assist colonoscopy ( CAC ) perform aid transparent inert cap attach distal end colonoscope . CAC allow close examination mucosa proximal flexures haustral fold prevents `` red '' closely approximated mucosa , aid luminal orientation examination . CAC show improve cecal intubation time , polyp detection rate , adenoma detection rate hand experience practitioner . A handful study also indicate benefit also extend trainee , another prospective study show improvement cecal intubation rate . The investigator hypothesize cap assist colonoscopy result significantly improve cecal intubation rate time , well adenoma detection rate , among trainee compare standard non cap assist colonoscopy large academic Gastroenterology train program United States . The study prospective randomize trial colonoscopy perform Harris Health System Ben Taub Hospital novice endoscopy trainee July 2015 enrollment complete . Novice endoscopy trainee define endoscopists less 10 colonoscopy perform July 2015 . All colonoscopy include performed novice endoscopist direct supervision board certify attend gastroenterologist . Each colonoscopy fulfil inclusion criterion randomize equal probability cap assist colonoscopy ( CAC ) group control standard colonoscopy ( SC ) group .</detailed_description>
