	<detailed_description>Musculoskeletal injury pose significant problem Active Duty Service Members main reason separation long-term disability . Little information exist determinant disability seek care pattern Sailors Marines experience MSI deployment support combat operation , despite fact branch arm service high level attrition disorder branch PBPT implement set potential dramatic impact study outcomes . It expect intervention psychologically-based physical therapy target common psychological risk factor ( yellow flag ) include fear activity include work , psychological distress , perceive disability effective reducing risk factor optimize recovery restore function intervention group . Active Duty Service Members seek care MSI carrier benefit early care train physical therapist , reduce likelihood formation maintenance maladaptive beliefs injury previously find associate disability . The propose study design quasi-experimental , pre-post- test non-concurrent control group test effectiveness psychologically-based physical therapy aboard US Navy Aircraft Carrier . This approach consist one deploy carrier serve intervention second carrier serve control . The two carrier ( intervention equivalent control ) chosen base deployment schedule . Both carrier similar deployment characteristic include ; length deployment , crew size deployed health care team . For purpose project , measurement do deployment ( pre physical therapy intervention one month enrollment ) deployment . Thus , two different endpoint use , post treatment endpoint ( one month enrollment ) , second take place carrier return deployment .</detailed_description>
