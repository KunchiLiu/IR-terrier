	<detailed_description>This single-center , randomize trial design examine hypothesis lifestyle-based mHealth peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) prevention program improve physical activity , fitness , important PAD risk factor quality life ( QOL ) . The investigator may enroll 55 men woman evaluate leg pain Duke PAD cardiovascular clinic low extremity angioplasty Duke catheterization laboratory . Of 55 men woman volunteer may initially consent , investigator anticipate portion ( potentially 20 % ) may drop study timeline , approximately 45 expect complete study . Following informed consent baseline testing , participant randomize ( 1.25:1.00 ) either mHealth ( N=25 ) usual care group ( N=20 ) [ comparison ] 24-week period . All patient evaluate walk ability treadmill test , quality life questionnaire , health literacy relate PAD important risk factor specific PAD ( blood glucose diabetic , daily physical activity blood pressure ) .</detailed_description>
