	<detailed_description>The inability suppress inappropriate fear response hallmark anxiety disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , panic , phobia disorder . Extinction fear occur exposure therapy ; however , temporary fear often re-emerges passage time ( spontaneous recovery ) , undermine maintenance therapeutic gain . Enhancing neural neurochemical substrate involve retention extinction memory critical solving challenge . Animal study show activation cannabinoid system within amgydala , hippocampus , ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( AMYG , HPC , vmPFC , respectively ) , brain structure critical fear expression extinction learning , enhances fear extinction retention . Specifically , CB1 receptor agonist , Î”9-tetrahydrocannibinol ( THC ) , facilitate extinction recall prevent recovery extinguish fear rat . However , phenomenon , , investigate human . This proof-of-concept project specifically aim assess effect THC recall extinction learn underlying neural circuit activation ( HPC , vmPFC ) test 24 hour 1 week extinction training , determine maintenance extinction retention ( 1 week later ) mediate enhancement vmPFC-HPC activation THC observe recall test 24 hour extinction learn . In randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , between-subjects design , investigator couple standard Pavlovian fear extinction paradigm fMRI simultaneous skin conductance recording acute pharmacological challenge oral , synthetic THC prior extinction learn healthy adult volunteer ( n=80 ) test extinction retention maintenance extinction learn 24 hour 1 week later , well fear renewal . This proof-of-concept study provide translational , impactful , informative , critical test first step towards development cannabinoid modulators adjunctive strategy exposure-based therapy augment extinction retention prevent return fear memory patient PTSD anxiety disorder .</detailed_description>
