	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 ( PLX3397 ) give together radiation therapy antihormone therapy treat patient prostate cancer intermediate high risk spread . Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth , may also help radiation therapy work well . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , leuprolide acetate , goserelin acetate , degarelix , may lessen amount androgen make body . Giving multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 radiation therapy antihormone therapy may better treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct phase I , dose escalation trial primary objective establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect radiation therapy ( RT ) , androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) , PLX3397 ( MTD ) tumor-associated macrophage ( TAMs ) prostate biopsy treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 . Patients receive multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 6 month , undergo radiation therapy 2 month daily ( Monday-Friday ) begin month 3 , undergo ADT leuprolide acetate , goserelin acetate , degarelix injection month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 20-30 day every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
