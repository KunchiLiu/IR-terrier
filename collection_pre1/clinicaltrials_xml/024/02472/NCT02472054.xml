	<brief_title>Treatment Familiar Lymphohistiocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH ) lymphohistiocytic activation syndrome inflammatory condition cause uncontrolled proliferation activate lymphocytes macrophage secrete excess inflammatory cytokine . Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( FHL ) rare disorder immune system , invariably fatal untreated . Treatment require achievement remission HLH prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , curative therapy date . Despite significant progress treatment , mortality remain high important number patient die eligible HSCT . A well understand pathophysiology FHL open new avenue immunotherapy . Based previous observation concern utilization Anti-thymoglobulins ( ATG ) treatment patient FHL , protocol propose new therapeutic strategy use Alemtuzumab association steroid first line treatment FHL . This proposition base hypothesis Alemtuzumab , capable kill T lymphocytes efficiently vivo , well tolerate ATG . In fact , contrast mechanism action ATG , Alemtuzumab activate T lymphocyte . A good tolerance efficacy Alemtuzumab expect treatment hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytic syndrome . This may positive impact survival HSCT , also overall survival quality life regard long-term neurological sequela . This multicenter , open , phase I/II , non-comparative , non randomize study . Patients recruit investigator hospitalization first episode lymphohistiocytic activation syndrome require specific treatment . Several visit ( include final visit ) schedule within trial period approximately 10 month patient , signature consent 6 month hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . The recruitment period 30 month ; total period study 40 month . The treatment consist intravenous administration CAMPATH® . For research purpose , investigator collect specific sample : - biobank ( Cytokine dosage ) inclusion visit day prior conditioning ; - pharmacokinetics CAMPATH® : every cure CAMPATH® every week . Also diagnostic lumbar puncture inclusion visit , day 14 require document response treatment determine result therapeutic care . The efficacy treatment measure Day14 , Day21 Day28 . All adverse event must report e-Case Report Form ( e-CRF )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria : Patient &lt; 18 year Patient diagnosis hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytic syndrome confirm least one follow two criterion : Genetic diagnosis FHL genetic disease predispose HLH like ChediakHigashi syndrome , Griscelli syndrome type II Xlinked lymphoproliferative syndrome type I II ( XLP1 XLP2 ) positive family history HLH Presence least 5 follow 8 criterion ( diagnostic criterion define `` Histiocyte Society '' ) : Fever Splenomegaly Cytopenia ( affect least two cell lineage : Hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g / dl , Platelets &lt; 100.000/μl , Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1.000/µl ) Hypertriglyceridemia / hypofibrinogenemia ( Fasting triglyceride ≥ 3 mmol / l , Fibrinogen ≤ 1.5 g / l ) Haemophagocytosis find histological specimen ( without evidence malignant process rheumatic disease ) Decreased absent NK function ( &lt; 10 % laboratory standard ) Ferritin ≥ 500μg / l Soluble CD25 ≥ 2.400U/ml presence activate T cell immune phenotyping Patient without prior specific treatment lymphohistiocytic activation syndrome treatment corticosteroid / ciclosporin . Patient beneficiary health insurance scheme Holder ( ) parental authority sign informed consent Man woman reproductive age willing take reliable contraceptive measure treatment 6 month end treatment Specific situation patient neurological involvement : Most patient neurological involvement cause HLH meet inclusion criterion . However patient may present isolated neurological involvement first manifestation familiar lymphohistiocytosis describe literature . These patient always present inclusion criterion . However clinical condition may justify inclusion prior confirmation genetic diagnosis and/or detection require diagnostic inclusion criterion . In absence require 5 8 diagnostic criterion , eventual inclusion patient predominant neurological involvement evaluate scientific committee judge inclusion study . The remain inclusion exclusion criterion must fulfil . A write report establish . Exclusion Criteria : Age ≥ 18 year Patients previously treat AntiThymoglobulin ( SAL ) , etoposide ( VP16 ) Alemtuzumab . Confirmed suspect diagnosis malignant rheumatic disease Contraindication ( ) administration Alemtuzumab : Hypersensitivity murine proteins excipients ( sodium chloride , dibasic sodium phosphate , potassium chloride , potassium dihydrogen phosphate , polysorbate 80 , disodium edetate dihydrate , water injection ) General evolve infection except infection trigger factor HLH .
