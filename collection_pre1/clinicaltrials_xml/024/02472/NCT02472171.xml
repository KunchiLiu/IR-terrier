	<detailed_description>Chronic inflammation one key etiological condition associate development progression chronic disease include Alzheimer 's disease , atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , insulin resistance , obesity cancer . The cause chronic inflammation role diet suppress inflammation challenge research question . Pattern recognition receptor ( PRRs ) , include Toll-like receptor ( TLRs ) , nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein ( NODs ) , inflammasome express innate immune cell activate variety endogenous molecule derive tissue injury diet ( particular saturate fatty acid ) , elicit inflammation . Dysregulated induction PRR-mediated inflammation know promote development chronic disease . Previous study show saturated fatty acid activate toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 ( NOD2 ) mediate signal pathway , whereas , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , certain polyphenols ( quercetin , luteolin , Epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) , resveratrol ) rich certain fruit vegetable inhibit TLR4 NOD2-mediated inflammation . In addition , numerous study demonstrate TLR4 knockout mouse protect high saturate fat diet-induced inflammation insulin resistance , suggest high fat diet-induced inflammation insulin resistance least partly mediate activation TLR4 . Direct evidence saturate fatty acid derive high fat meal activate PRRs human demonstrate . Thus , investigator propose determine whether saturated fatty acid derive high saturate fat meal activate blood monocyte PRRs whether dietary DHA freeze-dried blueberry powder suppress high saturate fat meal-induced inflammation inhibit PRR activation . The experimental procedure study activity last approximately 9 week . There three test day , schedule 4 week apart . On test day four blood draw ( one fasting blood draw three postprandial blood draw 1-hour , 3-hour 6-hour breakfast , respectively ) . Three endothelial function measurement ( EndoPAT ) carry test day . A pre-test dinner meal provide subject eat night test day . Subjects ask follow record low antioxidant polyphenol diet choose 3 day prior test day . This include minimize tea , wine , coffee , chocolate , fruit , vegetable , whole grain , soy , herb , spice , condiment , fatty fish . All volunteer participate test day , receive randomize cross-over fashion follow treatment : A . High saturate fat diet , placebo powder , sunflower oil . B . High saturate fat diet , blueberry powder , sunflower oil . C. High saturate fat diet , placebo powder , DHA . The high saturate fat meal identical treatment may contain tortilla , cheddar cheese , beef sausage , scramble egg , smoothie style drink contain sugar , vanilla extract , oil , whole milk yogurt ingredient mask treatment . The placebo powder may contain Beneprotein® ( Nestlé Nutrition ) , Benefiber® ( Novartis ) , oil , sugar , artificial food-grade blueberry flavor , artificial food-grade blue red color . The blueberry powder ( equivalent four 1/2 cup serving ) obtain U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council ( Folsom , CA ) . The DHA obtain Martek Biosciences . Blueberry placebo powder DHA sunflower oil combine blueberry flavor smoothie style drink . Neither study subject investigator know treatment provided test day .</detailed_description>
