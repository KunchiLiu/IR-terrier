	<brief_title>Optimal Order Concurrent Office Hysteroscopy Endometrial Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective single blind randomize control trial determine whether order performance office hysteroscopy ( OH ) endometrial biopsy ( EMB ) office evaluation abnormal uterine bleeding affect patient 's pain perception . We also intend investigate whether order procedure affect adequacy endometrial sample , duration procedure , optimal visualization uterine cavity . We hypothesize perform EMB prior OH result higher patient pain score . Included patient consecutive female patient age 18-70 presenting University South Florida Center Endometriosis Fibroid Treatment ( CFERT ) evaluation abnormal uterine bleeding uterine fibroid . Patients randomly assign either OH follow EMB EMB follow OH part clinical assessment AUB/uterine fibroid base clinical indication . The patient inform two indicated procedure clinical provider blind order performance . The healthcare provider/investigator aware order procedure assign perform . Patients consent participate study prior procedure study team day indicate procedure schedule CFERT . The healthcare provider perform procedure open unlabeled envelope , within piece paper indicate procedure perform first . This record study log . The study log include enrolled patient , assign study number range 001 minimum number patient require study indicated sample size calculation . At end procedure , patient ask describe pain perception base Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 0-10 . The adequacy endometrial sample determine pathology report . The duration entire procedure ( min ) time use stopwatch time insertion hysteroscope/Pipelle catheter external cervical canal removal instrument . A panoramic picture endometrial cavity take give blinded independent reviewer determine adequacy visualization base 3 point scoring system ( fair , good excellent ) . Fair visualization define tubal ostia visualize ; good define tubal ostia identify able visualize 180 degree panorama ; excellent visualization define visualize bilateral tubal ostia clear image uterine cavity 360 degree panorama .</detailed_description>
