	<brief_summary>Sexual dysfunction highly prevalent schizophrenic patient , affect 80 % men woman . Antipsychotic induce sexual side effect may barrier treatment compliance . Antipsychotics Risperdal Consta Invega Sustenna know high rate cause prolactin elevation may implicate sexual dysfunction . The basic premise study identify patient believe experience sexual dysfunction Risperdal Consta Invega Sustenna switch alternative long act injectable antipsychotic , Abilify Maintena tend low prolactin level . Measures sexual sexual functioning use self rat 5 item Arizona Sexual Experience Scale ( ASEX ) primary outcome measure make 3 month period determine switch helpful .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study perform several site oversight study monitor Thomas D Gazda MD PC accordance establish research principal , ICH GCP ( International Conference Harmonization Good Clinical Practice ) Guideline , FDA regulation applicable regulatory requirement local law . Source document use help ensure patient meet diagnostic criterion schizophrenia . All AE ( Adverse Event ) verbatim description perform ( investigator term CRF , Clinical Research File ) classify standardized medical terminology use Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) . Treatment emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) summarize . The incidence TEAEs report number ( percentage ) subject TEAs SOC ( Standard Care ) PT ( Preferred Term ) . The number ( percentage ) subject TEAEs also summarize relationship study drug ( possibly relate , probably relate relate ) . Adverse event summarize use Safety Analysis Sets . The number AEs number incidence ( % ) subject AEs summarize cohort dose overall . For clinically significant event , tome onset recovery report . The number ( percentage ) subject TEAEs lead death summarize MedDRA SOC PT . A subject data listing AEs lead death provide . The number ( percentage ) subject SAEs summarize MedDRA SOC PT . The number ( percentage ) subject TEAEs lead discontinuation study drug summarize MedDRA SOC PT . A subject data listing AEs lead discontinuation study provide . All safety analysis perform Safety Analysis Sets . Safety data summarize `` treat '' basis use descriptive statistic ( e.g . n , mean , standard deviation , median , minimum , maximum , continuous variable : n ( % ) categorical variable ) . Safety variable include TEAEs , clinical laboratory parameter , vital sign , SST ) . Study Day 1 safety analysis define date first dose study drug . The primary analysis primary efficacy endpoint base one-sample two side t-test . Missing value impute use last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) . The ASEX end 3 month treatment consider low baseline 2-sided p-value one-sample t-test statistic less equal 0.05 . As additional information , two-sided 95 % confidence interval change baseline ASEX score provide base t-distribution end 3 month aripiprazole monthly treatment schedule visit . As sensitivity analysis , primary analysis repeat base observed data ; also , mixed effect analysis covariance regression use model change baseline ASEX schedule visit . Baseline ASEX score fix effect , subject random effect , schedule visit repeat factor model . The key secondary analysis analyze way primary efficacy analysis The study -conduct duration approximately 4 month . Screening subject last approximately 8 month total study duration 12 month . project minimum 22 subject enrol estimate 19 subject complete study .</detailed_description>
