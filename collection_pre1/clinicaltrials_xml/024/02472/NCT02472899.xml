	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) progressive neurodegenerative disease characterize loss cognitive brain function functional decline . One pathological feature condition progressive deposition brain amyloid beta-peptide ( A-beta ) ( 1 ) . Once deposited brain , peptide exerts toxic effect trigger chronic inflammation interfere initially normal brain function result eventually neuronal death ( 2 ) . It currently postulate certain threshold A-beta accumulation compensatory mechanism brain longer sufficient cope A-beta toxicity , clinical syndrome AD develops . It possible A-beta may accumulate brain period 10-15 year clinical symptom become significant . The question raise whether accumulation A-beta possibly normal process age , suggest people may susceptible disease live long enough — note prevalence Alzheimer 's disease rise 40 % age 85 year . Among many possible ageing-related factor involve development AD , senescence immune system may significantly enhance change brain intensify neurological decline patient disease . A direct consequence immunosenescence increase frequency systemic infection , fact , many die AD previously suffer severe infection . Since patient AD ongoing chronic inflammatory response brain , associate activation glial cell partially disrupt blood brain barrier , systemic inflammation may intensify process brain increase overall neuronal damage . In contrast damage cause immune activation , A-beta vaccination study show promising effect mouse model disease , particularly regard clearance amyloid plaque A-beta antibody ( 3 ) . When tested patient AD , 6 % vaccinated patient develop severe inflammatory reaction brain ( 4 ) . Nonetheless , cohort patient show improved cognitive test specific antibody induce ( 5 ) . In recent study demonstrate brain inflammation may due increased level IFN-γ brain ( 6 ) , possibly result sub-clinical systemic infection specific immune response observe human . While chronic inflammation progress throughout disease , specific arm immune system , i.e. , brain-specific lymphocyte , may also stimulate play role . In contrast previous assumption , finding human subject AD demonstrate specific immune response A-beta indeed significantly induce elderly individual patient AD compare middle-aged individual ( 7 ) . The nature role immune response A-beta man yet investigate , may lead characterization pathway associate neuronal cell death , result new diagnostic modality immunotherapeutic approach . The purpose study determine whether peripheral marker possibly relate A-beta induced inflammation brain increase patient clinical AD . Method This observational pilot study compare level inflammatory marker peripheral blood patient AD age-matched cognitively normal elderly individual , well healthy young control . Subjects include male female older 60 year diagnose clinical AD accord DSM-IV criterion . The control group comprise cognitively normal community dwell male female older 60 year . In addition , group healthy young male female control age 20-30 year serve reference group . The diagnosis old patient control determine independently multidisciplinary team expert Memory Clinic Beersheva Mental Health Center . All subject control require provide write informed consent participation study . In case patient AD independent psychiatrist require confirm patient capable agree participation study . In case patient AD impair judgment unable consent participation , legal guardian require provide write informed consent . Following acquisition demographic data , single amount 25 ml blood drawn subject . Blood drawn two heparinized tube 10 ml one serological tube ( procoagulant ) five ml draw serum isolation . The heparinized tube maintain room temperature lymphocytes purified day . Sera sample store 4°C . Blood drawn midday facilitate purification day . Following peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) serum isolation follow analysis perform : 1 . Generation AD-specific monoclonal antibody . Since antibody bind N-terminus portion A-beta enhance clearance brain test clinical trial , important identify naturally occur specific monoclonal antibody induce patient AD determine whether affect course disease . Such specific antibody also may diagnostic therapeutic property . These specific human monoclonal antibody isolate produced vitro hybridoma technique use proprietary fusion partner cell line know MFP-2 . Briefly , PBMCs fuse MFP-2 result hybridoma screen nonspecific Ig production immunoglobulin specific A-beta use standard technique ELISA . Hybridomas secrete specific human monoclonal antibody serially subcloned stabilization , expand grown defined medium production large quantity monoclonal antibody . 2 . Analysis T-cell subsets serum-derived cytokine . Aging associated senecense immune system express decline naïve T cell increase memory regulatory T cell . As result cytokine homeostasis periphery brain alter may contribute pathogenesis AD . Thus , analysis T-cell subset ( naïve memory CD4 , CD8 , regulatory CD4CD25 ) use Fluorescence-activated cell sort ( FACS ) serum-derived cytokine ELISA perform correlated clinical score patient . Statistical evaluation difference mean value group perform use Student's-t test .</detailed_description>
