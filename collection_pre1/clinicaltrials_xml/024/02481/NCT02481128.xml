	<detailed_description>Sentinel node biopsy well establish tool axillary stag early breast cancer . So far impact preoperative lymph node scintigraphy unclear . Several study indicate sentinel node biopsy reliable method irrespective prior lymph node scintigraphy , data prospective randomize trial available . Although preoperative lymph node scintigraphy explicitly demand current S3 guideline Germany performance common practice . If preoperative lymphoscintigraphy could safely omit , possible benefit facilitation preoperative workflow well cost reduction health care system . This study aim clarify whether preoperative lymphoscintigraphy additional benefit prospective randomize study design . In two study arm sentinel node biopsy perform either without knowledge preoperative lymphoscintigraphy finding . Primary end point average number histologically detected sentinel lymph node per patient treatment arm .</detailed_description>
