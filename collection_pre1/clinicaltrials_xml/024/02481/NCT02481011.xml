	<detailed_description>The serious adverse effect antithrombotic therapy bleeding . Combinations antithrombotic agent frequently use ( e.g . use drug elute stent ischemic stroke ) , may lead increased frequency significant bleeding complication . Among hemorrhagic complication antithrombotic drug , intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) may particularly devastate consequence high morbidity , disability even mortality rate . Intracerebral hemorrhage ( hemorrhagic stroke ) generally associate high risk death incurs great loss health lifetime ischemic stroke . This make antithrombotic therapy double-edged sword . Although certain risk bleeding may acceptable context even great protection ischemic event , important quantify magnitude bleed risk . So far efficacy safety profile antithrombotic agent generally assess randomize control trial ( RCT ) . However , extrapolate result randomize clinical trial general patient population context challenge . Patients participate clinical trial frequently highly select therefore somewhat unrepresentative . In addition , number limit treatment period often much short routine management chronic disease condition . Finally , patient clinical trial often monitor closely routine practice . The incidence intracranial hemorrhage due antithrombotic therapy could theoretically monitor post-marketing surveillance include spontaneously report event . Unfortunately , seem provide reliable estimate . A recent study Finland show bleeding complication due oral anticoagulation Warfarin underreported daily clinical practice . Further , show reporting rate side effect follow medical therapy tend decrease time indicate likely adverse event new drug report drug available many year . This population-based large-scale pharmaco-epidemiological study need , cohorts patient expose antithrombotic medication monitor determine valid reliable risk treatment .</detailed_description>
