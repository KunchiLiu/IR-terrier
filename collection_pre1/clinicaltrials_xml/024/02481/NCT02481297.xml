	<brief_title>Lirilumab With Rituximab Relapsed , Refractory High-risk Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatment : Each study cycle 28 day . You receive rituximab vein 4-6 hour Days 1,8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 . After Cycle 1 , receive rituximab Day 1 Cycles 2-12 . You also receive lirilumab vein 1 hour Day 1 cycle . Study Visits : On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycles 1 2 every 2 week Cycles 3-6 : - You physical exam . You exam Days 8 22 Cycle 2 . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need , blood may need drawn may need test perform often . The study doctor tell blood drawn blood draw repeat . On Day 1 cycle , become pregnant , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . On Day 28 Cycles 3 6 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw may include pregnancy test become pregnant . Urine may also collect pregnancy test . - You bone marrow aspiration/biopsy check status disease . - You CT PET scan . At least 1 time month Cycle 7 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At least 1 time every 3 month Cycle 7 : - Urine collect routine test . This routine urine collection include pregnancy test , become pregnant . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) may also draw pregnancy test . - You bone marrow aspiration/biopsy check status disease . - You CT PET scan . Any time doctor think need study , blood draw , CT PET scan , and/or bone marrow aspirations/biopsies check status disease and/or monitor health . If doctor think acceptable , may able test , routine blood urine collection , perform local lab clinic closer home . The result send study doctor review . Ask study staff study doctor possibility . Length Study : You may receive 12 cycle rituximab 24 cycle lirilumab . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study 1 year follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . - If doctor think need , CT PET scan . Follow-Up Visits : After end-of-study visit , follow test procedure perform . One ( 1 ) time month 1 year : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . One ( 1 ) time every 3-6 month 1 year , doctor think need : - You bone marrow aspirate check status disease . - You CT scan PET scan . If start new type anticancer treatment year last dose study drug , stop follow-up visit . This investigational study . Lirilumab FDA approve commercially available . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available treatment CLL . The use drug combination treat CLL/SLL consider investigational . The study doctor explain drug design work . Up 48 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
