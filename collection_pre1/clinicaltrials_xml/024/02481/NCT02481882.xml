	<brief_summary>This study provide information cortical haemodynamics MS patient address discrepancy report previous literature , allow insight role haemodynamics disease . It also instruct u effective scanning protocol future research . Developing suitable protocol study perfusion longitudinally may also enable identification new therapeutic intervention normalise perfusion abnormality MS patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Baseline Cortical Haemodynamics MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We aim characterise underlying cortical haemodynamics Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . We assess two technique measure blood flow brain : arterial spin labelling ( ASL ) dynamic susceptibility contrast ( DSC ) magnetic resonance image MS patient group . ASL non-invasive technique whilst DSC-MR require administration tracer intravenously . Previous study show conflict result measurement . Reproducibility ASL disease activity also assess repeat scan session . Global perfusion MS patient group compare match healthy control group . In addition measuring blood flow use method , investigate whether difference perfusion MS patient group healthy control observe use ASL , also assess reproducibility ASL measurement via repeat scan . These repeat scanning session also provide window study disease activity patient cohort , patient may invite return total 4 scanning session ( one involve use DSC ) good ass usefulness ASL track haemodynamic change MS. Study Regimen : We aim recruit 20 MS patient 20 healthy age-matched control study . MS Patient Cohort : The patient ask attend two initial scan session . MS Scan Session 1 involve use Prohance contrast agent , take blood sample MRI scan . MS Scan Session 2 involve use non-invasive MRI scan . MS Scan Session 1 : This session require administration gadolinium contrast agent . Prior enter scanner , cannula insert patient 's arm ( cannula A ) . A small blood sample ( 5ml ) take MS patient order assess haematocrit creatinine content use determine eligible gadolinium administration ( via use POCT i-Stat ) . This provide measure eGFR provide information patient 's renal function . This perform per patient result record CRF . Provided patient 's eGFR adequate study , second cannula insert patient 's arm ( cannula B ) . The patient enter scanner line attach cannulae . The gadolinium bolus administer clinician scan room scan via cannula A* . During remainder visit , three subsequent blood sample take ( 5ml ) , via cannula B , use measure gadolinium concentration . Gadolinium administration blood work perform physician part research team ALS training . * Gadolinium contrast agent allow accurate quantification blood flow MR imaging . Prohance ( Gadoteridol ) gadolinium-based fluid administer intravenously participant . The contrast agent administer physician advance life support ( ALS ) training . The physician remain present throughout duration scan time whilst participant present Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre . In event emergency , resuscitation kit readily available . Also , University 's internal emergency phone number contact readily direct emergency service site . MS Scan Session 2 : The patient ask return MS Scan Session 2 two week complete MS Scan Session 1 . Before scan session , patient ask complete MR safety questionnaire ensure contraindication arisen scan . Explanations expect MRI scanner environment give prior ask sign consent form . Provided contraindication volunteer enter scanner , volunteer undergo non-invasive MRI scan lasting approximately 1 hour . No intervention use . All scan perform use 7 Tesla Philips Achieva scanner multi-transit capability ( Philips Medical Systems , Best , The Netherlands ) . The participant scan 32-channel receive coil . The subject wear-ear plug , ear defender pulse oximeter ( monitor pulse ) throughout contrast agent administration . After completion MS Scan Sessions 1 2 , scan analyse interpreted member patient 's clinical care team . If patient present morphological change relate disease MS Scan Sessions 1 2 , patient invite back additional 2 scan , label MS Scan Session 3 4 . If presentation additional lesion scan , end patient 's participation . MS Scan Sessions 3 4 : These identical MS Scan Session 2 ( non-invasive MRI scan ) . MS Scan Session 3 take place 6 week MS Scan Session 4 take place 12 week . Healthy Volunteers : The healthy volunteer ask attend two scan session ( label HV Scan Session 1 HV Scan Session 2 flow chart ) . Both HV Scan Session 1 2 involve use non-invasive MRI scan . No gadolinium contrast agent give healthy volunteer study . Both HV Scan Session 1 2 identical MS Scan Sessions 2 , 3 4 . Upon complete HV Scan Session 1 , healthy volunteer invite back HV Scan Session 2 two week later . After complete HV Scan Session 2 , healthy volunteer 's participation finish .</detailed_description>
