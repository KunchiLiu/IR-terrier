	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation Patients With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) common severe traumatic central nervous system damage . And treatment SCI still worldwide problem clinic . How improve curative effect SCI restore limb nerve function far possible become key problem clinical treatment SCI . The current treatment spinal cord injury mainly include surgical treatment , medical therapy , physical therapy , prevent complication injury , treatment make clinical improvement patient , patient also face severe nerve dysfunction . Animal experiment clinical research recent year report use umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell ( UC-MSCs ) transplantation treat spinal cord injury , provide new approach SCI treatment , efficacy remain controversial , lack high credible prospective cohort clinical trial evidence support . In study , completely incompletely cervical , thoracic spinal cord injury participant recruit join prospective , cohort clinical trial . Intervention subarachnoid injection human allogeneic UC-MSCs main evaluation index American spinal injury association ( ASIA ) score , secondary evaluation indicator electromyogram electroneurophysiologic test . A monocenter prospective cohort study perform evaluate effectiveness UC-MSCs , treatment completely incompletely spinal cord injury . The primary outcome American spinal injury association ( ASIA ) score baseline , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 24 month post-treatment . Secondary outcome study include number participant adverse event 1 month post-treatment , electromyogram electroneurophysiologic test baseline , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 24 month post-treatment . On basis result trial investigator , first time , scientific evidence relative safety efficacy UC-MSCs transplantation treatment spinal cord injury .</detailed_description>
