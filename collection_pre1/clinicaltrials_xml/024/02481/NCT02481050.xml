	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , open-label , single arm , multicenter , 2-stage study eribulin mesylate administer biweekly 1.4 mg/m2 intravenously treatment participant HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously treat 2 5 chemotherapy regimen . The study conduct 3 Phases : Pretreatment Phase ( screen visit ) , Treatment Phase ( start Cycle 1 Day 1 ) , Posttreatment Phase ( End treatment visit survival follow ) . Participants may remain study drug long demonstrate clinical benefit intercurrent illness , unacceptable toxicity , disease progression occur , participant withdraws consent , death .</detailed_description>
