	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine wether activate expand autologous Natural Killer cell ( NKAEs ) effective treatment patient multiple myeloma second later relapse . NKAEs use combination anti-myeloma drug lenalidomide bortezomib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Expanded Activated Autologous NK Cells Treat Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It expect enroll 10 15 patient within 18 month . Patients achieve stable disease induction therapy . Peripheral blood patient collect every cycle ( n=4 ) produce NKAEs Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) condition peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) co-cultured genetically modify cell line ( K562-mb15-41BBL ) 100 IU/ml interleukin-2 . Treatment consist 4 cycle anti-myeloma consolidation treatment two infusion NKAEs every day 1 8 cycle . Usually , choose treatment regime bortezomib ( Velcade ) lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) . These treatment use combined corticosteroid medication need suspend NKAEs infusion . A washout period 2 week require . NKAEs dose cell constant , 7.5x106/kg . There interim analysis intra-cohort one week first batch two infusion . If analysis grade IV adverse effect observe proceed second cycle inclusion patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects 20 80 year old With multiple myeloma 2nd later relapse show resistance 2 treatment line Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) ≤ 2 Life expectancy great six month Creatinine clearance rate 30 ml / min Subjects receive least 4 cycle rescue treatment procedure 12 de Octubre Hospital ( rescue treatment vary depend previous antimyeloma treatment ) . After treatment , patient must show chemosensitivity disease stabilization . Will include subject partial response stable disease ( least 2 cycle ) 75 % plan rescue treatment patient subclinical progression ( defined increase monoclonal component ≥ 25 % ) time rescue treatment . Subjects show tolerance rescue treatment , without G3/4 adverse effect , G1/2 adverse effect exist must analyze immediately start reinfusion program . Subjects agree participate trial sign inform consent . Subjects clinical progression complete response include .
