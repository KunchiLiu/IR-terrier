	<detailed_description>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) method enables noninvasive electrical stimulation cortex via electrode place subject 's skull . tDCS show improve motor learning , visuomotor coordination , probabilistic classification , boost memory human find well tolerated child early onset schizophrenia , continuous spike-wave sleep ( CSWS ) , refractory epilepsy dystonia . The method approve investigational purpose FDA . High definition tDCS ( HD-tDCS ) allow precise generation electrical field select cortical area use multiple electrode . Positioning stimulate electrode determine help MR brain image appropriate modeling . The purpose pilot trial study feasibility , tolerability , safety HD-tDCS administer daily total 20 session . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES Part I : To assess feasibility tolerability HD-tDCS , administer 5 day per week total 20 session healthy adult subject ; Part I define positive 5 healthy adult accrue within study period ( 12 month ) least 4 5 participant successful completion . Tolerability measure proportion subject able complete 20 session assign treatment within 6 week . Part II : After review safety data Part I complete review Data Safety Monitoring Committee IRB , Part II initiate . To assess feasibility tolerability HD-tDCS , administer 5 day per week total 20 session adult subject Down Syndrome ; Part II define positive 5 adult Down Syndrome accrue within study period ( 12 month ) least 4 5 participant successful completion . Tolerability measure proportion subject able complete 20 session assign treatment within 6 week . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Part I : - Collect pilot data safety HD-tDCS healthy adult , safety define incident adverse event . Safety outcomes include vital sign , physical/neurologic exam finding , weight , electrocardiograms electroencephalogram . - Collect pilot data feasibility efficacy endpoint . These include assessment impact HD-tDCS , administer 5 day per week total 20 session , EEG amplitudes coherence low ( &lt; 8Hz ) high ( &gt; 9Hz ) frequency range coherence low ( &lt; 8Hz ) gamma ( 30-80 Hz ) frequency range healthy adult . Part II : - Collect pilot data safety HD-tDCS adult Down Syndrome , safety define incident adverse event . Safety outcomes include vital sign , physical/neurologic exam finding , weight , electrocardiograms electroencephalogram . - Collect pilot data feasibility efficacy endpoint . These include assessment impact HD-tDCS , administer 5 day per week total 20 session , EEG amplitudes coherence low ( &lt; 8Hz ) high ( &gt; 9Hz ) frequency range coherence low ( &lt; 8Hz ) gamma ( 30-80 Hz ) frequency range adult Down Syndrome .</detailed_description>
