	<brief_summary>The primary goal proposal improve quality care outcomes patient discharge heart failure use innovative multidisciplinary group intervention approach . Heart failure complex chronic illness comprehensive patient-centered care difficult resource intensive . One potential solution use share medical appointment ( SMA ) , multi-disciplinary team provider expertise nutrition , nursing , behavior medication management join manage heart failure . The investigator enroll patient Providence , Cleveland Phoenix VA Hospitals within 12 week discharge heart failure hospitalization randomize receive SMA intervention usual care . Results project expect add innovative intervention could improve outcome important patient VA : health status , hospitalization , mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary goal research project improve health status decrease hospitalization death patient discharge heart failure ( HF ) via education patient , disease monitoring medication titration share medical appointment ( SMAs ) . Studies find patient self-care behavior HF ( e.g . medication/dietary non-compliance ) health system factor ( e.g . care discoordination , limited access , lack education patient caregiver ) play important role patient 's health status hospitalization risk extent 50 % readmission judge possibly/probably preventable . To address patient system factor base Chronic Care Model , redesign care delivery , via SMA 's , good solution provide patient self-management support also perform disease monitor medication management environment peer support . The investigator propose randomize controlled trial enroll patient within 12 week discharge HF hospitalization randomize receive either SMA intervention every one-two week 4 session versus usual care HF . The investigator determine , 180 day randomization , whether HF patient participate HF-SMA , compare patient receive usual care : 1 . Experience well cardiac health status measure Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( primary outcome ) , overall health status ( EQ5D , secondary outcome ) ; 2 . Have few hospitalization death 3 . Experience improvement intermediate outcome : ) increase HF Self-Care behavior , b ) decrease plasma BNP level . For patient underwent HF-SMA , investigator also determine perceive benefit , area need improvement , potential obstacle implementation , fidelity intervention across site , conduct ( ) face-to-face interview patient ( b ) telephone interview stakeholder ( physician patient administrator ) . The site Providence VA , Cleveland VA Phoenix VA hospital enroll total 375 patient . The study duration 180 day patient time randomization . The investigator use stratify ( enrollment program HF care , &lt; 2 hospitalization last 6 month , leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % ) , block randomization block size 4 site ensure balance stratified variable . The team consist nutritionist , nurse , health psychologist , clinical pharmacist and/or nurse practitioner , without presence physician ( cardiologist available call ) . The session contain assessment patient need , theme-based disease self-management education , patient-initiated disease management discussion , break-out session individualize medication case management . The study finding use health care management system redesign provide good quality patient center care Veterans HF . The long-term goal use multi-disciplinary team approach group set manage HF support regular physician visit , peer support environment , , necessary provide patient-centered care improve outcome .</detailed_description>
