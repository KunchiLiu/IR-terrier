	<brief_summary>Between 40 % 60 % bipolar patient experience neurocognitive impairment acute mood episode also remission period . These rate quite similar report regard functional impairment . In fact , estimate one third patient achieve full social occupational recovery get back premorbid level . Moreover , neurocognitive deficit , together clinical sociodemographic variable think contribute functional impairment bipolar disorder , similarly find schizophrenia . Little published regard neurocognitive remediation bipolar disorder . The first open label study bipolar disorder publish 2010 positive result . Recently , multicenter randomize clinical trial coordinate show efficacy innovative intervention improve function reduce disability bipolar patient . There need investigate novel creative way work cognitive deficit include new technology order reduce cost increase benefit patient . No study address computerized cognitive training bipolar disorder develop far . This project aim test efficacy e-neurocognitive module adjunct functional remediation bipolar patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Innovative E-neurocognitive Module Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize clinical study , rater-blind , placebo-controlled stratified age , sex educational level ass efficacy new program , adjunctive e-neurocognitive module , functional remediation intervention . The primary outcome measure improvement global psychosocial functioning measure blindly mean change score Functioning Assessment Short Test baseline endpoint . The sample compose 132 euthymic bipolar ( type I II ) patient assessed baseline regard several clinical , functional neuropsychological variable . Subsequently , patient consecutively start functional remediation group , group finish patient randomly assign ( 1:1 ) two different group . The experimental group ( EG , 66 patient ) take part 12-week extension total 36 hour train e-cognitive module tailor bipolar patient whilst control group ( CG , 66 patient ) receive sort add-on training recommendation therapists train amount time experimental group : twice per week total 3 hour material provide functional remediation group . All patient keep receive standard psychiatric treatment accord local treatment guideline management bipolar patient . At nine month , home training complete , patient assess regard several clinical , functional neuropsychological variable . All patient assess monthly regard several clinical variable , include mood measurement ( YMRS HDRS ) . At 24 month baseline , measurement repeat patient . In total , three assessment conduct ( baseline , post-intervention 2 year follow-up ) . The first active intervention patient receive Functional Remediation Program : * The Functional Remediation Program consist 21 weekly session , 90 minute . This intervention address neurocognitive issue attention , memory executive function focus even enhance function daily routine . The content intervention base ecological task perform two setting , clinical also home . Patients trained exercise memory , attention , problem solve reasoning , multitasking organization order improve functional outcome . Most technique base `` paper pencil '' task group activity . After randomization patient continue train e-neurocognitive module specially adaptated bipolar patient . 1 . The e- neurocognitive module tailor bipolar patient 's cognitive functional profile use newly develop personalize cost effective technology adapt program apply patient acquire brain injury . The total duration 36 hour distribute 1 ' 5 hour twice per week aim enhance cognitive impairment function use flexible system ( website ) . Therefore , novelty current project first trial test implementation innovative neurocognitive intervention bipolar patient impact daily life , use new technology , reduce stigma , transfer responsibility patient , provide opportunity improve cognitive deficit home , monitor neuropsychologist hospital , good balance costs-benefits . The emphasis stress social cognition skill highly correlate psychosocial functioning . 2 . Control group . Will receive standard instruction finish functional remediation group order keep training home . In two group pharmacological treatment prescribe accord local treatment guideline management bipolar patient . Criteria discontinuation study one following : 1 ) Missing five session Functional Remediation intervention 2 ) Hospitalization type episode clinical meaningful affective relapse 3 ) Withdrawal consent .</detailed_description>
