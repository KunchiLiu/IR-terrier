	<brief_summary>Patients sustain broken ankle high risk develop arthritis soon injury ( within 2 year ) . This arthritis cause increase pain decrease level function , especially injury occurs early age . During shortly ankle injury , inflammatory chemical process take place ankle cause damage cartilage ankle joint .

	<detailed_description>Patients sustain broken ankle high risk develop arthritis soon injury ( within 2 year ) . This arthritis cause increase pain decreased level function , especially injury occurs early age . During shortly ankle injury , inflammatory chemical process take place ankle cause damage cartilage ankle joint . Currently treatment injury surgery two step process . When patient ankle fracture , surgeon stabilize fracture external fixation device allow ankle swell decrease show improve outcome within hour . After 10 day patient come back final surgery surgeon open ankle joint make sure joint line fix plat screw . There intervention do regard physiologic process go inside ankle joint ankle injure . This investigator intend study . There large destructive process may contribute early development arthritis . The investigator would like see effect inflammatory response addition platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) produce small vial patient 's blood . PRP use safely patient osteoarthritis show slow progression improve pain score . PRP make spin patient 's blood centrifuge separate blood cell . The blood cell anti-inflammatory nature take place another syringe . This blind randomize control study . There two group patient randomize : PRP group , Normal Saline Group . In group , investigator 's plan withdraw joint fluid injure uninjured ankle time first surgery analyze joint fluid ankle . Participants randomize PRP group receive PRP injure ankle time first surgery external fixator place . Participants randomize Normal Saline group receive Normal Saline injure ankle time first surgery external fixator place . After 7-14 day participant return second surgery definitive fixation . At time surgery , joint fluid take joint analysis see PRP decrease anti-inflammatory cell decrease inflammation . After second surgery participant follow clinic regular manner .</detailed_description>
