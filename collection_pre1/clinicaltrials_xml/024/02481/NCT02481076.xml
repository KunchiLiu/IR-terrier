	<detailed_description>Malleolar fracture Surgical treatment patient malleolar fracture impose special challenge orthopaedic surgeon . A typical ankle fracture result haematoma , sometimes blister almost always oedema formation . This postpone optimal time surgery . When operate swollen ankle , become obvious surgeon tissue elasticity normal structure change . This complicate surgical approach , procedure , reduction fracture closure incision . Quite often skin difficult adapt , result excessive tension suture . This potentially lead skin necrosis wind dehiscence . Blood fluid imbibe tissue prolong operating time , increase risk post-operative infection , thereby give patient painful extend post-operative course . When strive give patient good treatment rehabilitation , paramount prevent surgical complication . Compression therapy , part standard treatment ankle fracture , yet describe literature previous study test efficiency patient group , systematic manner . It new , innovative way help patient faster rehabilitation prevent surgical soft tissue complication . If study prof expect effect soft tissue complication , compression therapy probably also show effect fracture type : knee- , wrist- , tibia- femoral fracture , make compression therapy integrate part standard fracture regime orthopaedic department . Malleolar fracture Denmark incidence 107/100.000 person , make one common fracture type country . In Denmark 6000 malleolar fracture operate year . Studies show increased complication rate elderly , diabetic , smoker , patient immunomodulating medication , alcoholic , patient osteoporosis peripheral neuropathy . Treatment malleolar fracture Denmark show great local variation , standard differs hospital , often low grade clinical evidence . Nordsjællands Hospital decide , implement standard regime Flowtron Hydroven 3™ Coban™ 2 lite , prevent oedema formation blistering . The decision come clinician observe high incidence oedema , blister wound heal problem cohort patient , often force surgeon postpone surgery prolonging inpatient stay , result long cumbersome rehabilitation patient . Intermittent pneumatic compression Intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) use mainly prevention DVT . The use IPC treatment postoperative soft tissue care sporadically mention literature . These study define mechanisms action either mechanical chemical . The mechanical effect due improve vascularity , redirection blood flow cyclic load . The chemical effect cause increase production nitric oxide ( NO ) , produce vasodilation increase inflammatory mediator , promote heel stimulate proliferation fibroblast endothelial cell . Some study investigate effect IPC vascularity bone soft tissue ( animal study ) , fracture relate oedema oedema relate venous disease medical condition , show convincing effect . Accumulating data experimental animal study suggest use IPC increase neurovascular ingrowth , amount newly organize parallel collagen fibre , fibroblast proliferation proliferative repair . Further IPC counteract negative influence immobilization tissue repair . Therefore , theoretically one expect application IPC unit newly operate immobilized patient ankle , would prevent oedema formation , speed tissue regeneration enhance arterial blood flow thereby prevent wound heal problem define infection , wound dehiscence , prolong healing , skin necrosis , expose hardware , maybe also accelerate bone heeling . COBAN 2 lite Coban™ 2 lite compression bandage consist inner comfort layer outer stretch layer , design deliver therapeutic compression treatment venous leg ulcer related condition . The bandage purpose patient less tolerant compression , mixed aetiology ABPI ( ankle brachial pressure index ) ≥ 0,5 . Correctly apply , bandage take form solid tube reduces slippage let patient wear several week without need re-application . The use compression stocking bandage well described literature , integrate part management oedema end venous ulcer , address come fracture treatment . Adverse effect Intermittent pneumatic compression The IPC device routinely employed prevention deep venous thromboembolism ( DVT ) subsequently pulmonary embolism ( PE ) management lymfoedema . It consider safe efficient alternative medical thromboprophylaxis adverse effect describe literature , consist case report . When use IPC DVT prophylaxis often apply surgery patient general anaesthesia , hinder patient report discomfort . One author describe case , application IPC patient cancer associate thrombosis embolism , result pulmonary embolism . The patient show sign DVT prior surgery , author concludes PE might take place regardless application IPC device . Two case report describes peroneal nerve palsy possible adverse effect IPC . The first case concern woman pancreatic cancer weight loss , develop peroneal nerve palsy bilaterally surgery , probably subcutaneous fat protect nerve applied pressure fibular head compression boot . The second case concern obese patient undergo 10 hour intracranial surgery . One author report case old woman postoperative delirium fragile skin develop hemorrhagic bulla IPC-device . This could probably avoid , patient ben delirious inept report discomfort . Some author try associate IPS unit compartment syndrome , case patient undergone prolonged operation lithotomy state , know increase risk compartment syndrome lower leg . Malfunctioning equipment describe literature , rare . The IPC-device cause warmth sweat inflatable textile discomfort place incorrectly directly top suture . Compression bandage There description literature major side effect compression bandage . During early implementation compression treatment malleolar fracture unit Orthopaedic Surgery , Nordsjællands Hospital , pressure-wounds observed , one case visible Achilles tendon . Several minor pressure wound note , successfully heal conservative treatment . The Coban™ 2 lite cause discomfort tightness , apply firmly . The inner comfortlayer chafe bony prominence tendon apply thick . Precautionary measure In order prevent side effect discomfort , project manager routinely frequently examine patient include trial . This take place Emergency Department , bedward 48-72 hour admission , postoperatively . The staff receive ongoing training application observation Coban™ 2 lite Flowtron Hydroven 3™ , order prevent malfunction misapplication . Hypotheses Aims Hypotheses Study1 - That compression regime reduces wind infection 10-40 % 5 % patient mono- , bi- , trimalleolar fracture treat accord ORIF-principles ( open reduction internal fixation ) Study 2 - That retrospective study establish historical incidence infection , compression regime implement .
