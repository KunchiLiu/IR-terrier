	<brief_title>Is Iron Deficiency Cause Anemia Among Women Cambodia ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Anemia severe public health problem Cambodia , affect ~44 % woman reproductive age . Defined hemoglobin ( Hb ) concentration 120 g/L , anemia increase risk adverse pregnancy outcome impair work capacity productivity . The potential cause anemia poor nutrition ( e.g . micronutrient deficiency ) , genetic Hb disorder ( e.g . thalassemia ) , inflammation disease . Globally , common cause anemia think iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) . This assume major cause anemia Cambodia , Cambodian diet , consist mainly rice , lack iron-rich animal food source . However , finding previous study Cambodia ( Canadian government fund study investigate multiple intervention improve food nutrition security ) show IDA almost non-existent challenge assumption . In cross-sectional survey 450 woman rural Cambodia , 1.0 % Hb ferritin level indicative IDA ( Hb &lt; 120 g/L ferritin &lt; 15 μg/L ) . A national survey conduct UNICEF 2014 find similarly low rate IDA ( Dr. Arnaud Laillou , UNICEF Cambodia ) . Further , micronutrient know associated anemia also low ( &lt; 3 % ) include folate vitamin B12 B6 . On hand , nutrient know associated anemia zinc riboflavin deficiency prevalent ( 30 % 82 % , respectively ) . In addition , 54 % Prey Veng woman genetic Hb disorder ( e.g. , α-thalassemias ) , inherit disease result defective Hb structure and/or impair Hb production , either reduce Hb concentration increase risk anemia . Further , genetic Hb disorder cause ferritin soluble transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) concentration increase , reduce diagnostic sensitivity biomarkers identify IDA . In 2011 , Cambodian Ministry Health ( MOH ) recommend weekly iron folic acid ( IFA ) supplementation woman reproductive age , consistent WHO guideline . However , iron deficiency major cause anemia , best supplementation waste valuable resource bad could cause harm . Further , justification provision multiple micronutrient among population yet prove , despite push organization WHO . There urgent need conduct trial clarify whether iron micronutrient deficiency major cause anemia Cambodia . Research Hypotheses : The iron-supplemented group significantly high mean Hb concentration placebo group 12-weeks , indicate high prevalence iron deficiency suggest ferritin sTfR biomarkers baseline . The multiple micronutrient iron group significantly high mean Hb concentration iron alone-supplemented group , indicate addition micronutrient confer benefit reduce anemia . Reticulocyte count sensitive biomarker predict responsiveness iron therapy . Research Goals Objectives : Goal 1 . To determine iron deficiency exist among woman Cambodia , genetic Hb disorder inflammation prevalent , conduct randomize control trial iron supplementation . Objective 1 : To compare Hb concentration ( g/L ) 12-weeks supplementation woman determine iron significantly improve Hb concentration , compare placebo . Goal 2 : To determine addition micronutrient confers additional benefit iron supplementation , conduct 2 x 2 factorial study design . Objective 2 : To compare Hb concentration ( g/L ) across four group ( multiple micronutrient iron , multiple micronutrient without iron , iron alone , placebo ) 12-weeks . Goal 3 . To investigate multiple biomarkers iron deficiency determine sensitive specific predict response iron multiple micronutrient iron supplementation . Objective 3 : To determine hematological indicator ( baseline value ferritin , sTfR , reticulocyte count hepcidin ) strong diagnostic ability predict responsiveness iron therapy 12-weeks use receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) analyse . Study Design : A 2 x 2 factorial double blind randomize control trial conduct 12 week . A total ~800 woman ( 18-45 ) anemia recruit randomize 1 4 group : multiple micronutrient iron , multiple micronutrient without iron , iron alone placebo . Population Setting : Cambodian woman recruit local health center use convenience sample 4 randomly select village peri-urban area Kampong Chhnang province . This province ~1.5 hour outside capital city Phnom Penh . Randomization : Women randomize 1:1 computer-generated random list one four intervention ( n=200 group ) . Randomization either treatment control group reduce bias confound factor , may affect Hb response ( outcome ) . The manufacturer gel capsule responsible blind four intervention time capsule packaging retain confidentiality capsule content time study completion . Methods : Blood collect baseline , 1 12 week intervention assess Hb , hematological biomarkers ( reticulocyte count , MCV , RDW , hepcidin ) , micronutrient iron biomarkers ( vitamin B12 , folate , zinc , riboflavin , ferritin , sTfR , RBP ) inflammation ( AGP CRP ) genetic Hb disorder . We use general linear model measure difference Hb concentration across four group intervention . Receiver operate characteristic curve use determine diagnostic ability multiple hematological indicator predict responsiveness iron therapy . Implications : This translational research urgently require Cambodia build evidence need inform Ministry Health strategy , policy program reduce , prevent treat anemia among woman Southeast Asia ( ~300,000,000 ) among Southeast Asian immigrant Canada ( number ~450,000 2031 ) .</detailed_description>
