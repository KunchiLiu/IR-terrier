	<brief_title>Study Orally Administered AG-881 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors , Including Gliomas , With IDH1 and/or IDH2 Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase I , multicenter study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics clinical activity AG-881 glioma , harbor IDH1and/or IDH2 mutation . The first portion study dose escalation phase cohorts patient receive ascend oral dos AG-881 determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase II dose . The second portion study dose expansion phase patient receive AG-881 evaluate safety , tolerability , clinical activity recommend Phase II dose . The anticipated time study treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity occur patient remove discretion investigator</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must ≥18 year age Patient must histologically cytologically confirm solid tumor , include glioma , document IDH1 and/or IDH2 genemutation . Patients dose escalation phase must disease recur progressed follow standard therapy and/or therapy inhibitor mutant IDH1 and/or IDH2 , respond therapy . Patients expansion phase may previously untreated disease Patient must evaluable disease RECIST v1.1 patient without glioma RANO RANO LGG criterion patient glioma Patients glioma must baseline brain MRI scan Patient must archive primary tumor biopsy surgical specimen , biopsy recurrent metastatic sample Patient must amenable serial peripheral blood sampling , urine sampling , tumor biopsy study Patient must able understand willing sign inform consent Patient must ECOG PS 0 2 Patient must expect survival ≥3 month Patient must adequate bone marrow function evidence absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 ×10^9/L ; hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL ( Patients allow transfused level ) ; platelet ≥75 × 10^9/L Patient must adequate hepatic function evidence : Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) , unless consider due Gilbert 's disease disease involvement ; Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) ≤2.5 × ULN . For patient bone metastasis and/or suspect diseaserelated liver biliary involvement , AST , ALT ALP must ≤5 × ULN Patient must adequate renal function evidence : Serum creatinine ≤2.0 × ULN Creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min base CockroftGault glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) estimate : ( 140Age ) x ( weight kg ) x ( 0.85 female ) /72 x serum creatinine Patient must recover clinically relevant toxic effect prior surgery , radiotherapy , therapy intend treatment cancer Female patient reproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior first study drug administration . Patients reproductive potential define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy tubal occlusion experience natural menopause ( i.e. , menstruate ) least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . Women reproductive potential well fertile men partner female reproductive potential must agree abstain sexual intercourse use two highly effective form contraception time give informed consent , study , 90 day ( female male ) follow last dose AG 881 Patients receive systemic anticancer therapy radiotherapy &lt; 21 day prior first day study drug administration Patients receive investigational agent ( include AG120 AG221 ) &lt; 14 day prior first day study drug administration . In addition , first dose AG881 occur period ≥5 halflives investigational agent ( AG120 AG221 ) elapse . Patients gliomas prior treatment bevacizumab ( Avastin ) exclude Patients pregnant breast feeding Patients active severe infection require antiinfective therapy unexplained fever &gt; 38.5°C screen visit first day study drug administration ( discretion Investigator , patient tumor fever may enrol ) Patients New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV congestive heart failure LVEF &lt; 40 % echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan obtain within approximately 28 day C1D1 Patients history myocardial infarction within 6 month prior screen Patients know unstable uncontrolled angina pectoris Patients known history severe and/or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia Patients QTc interval ≥450 msec factor increase risk QT prolongation arrhythmic event ( e.g. , heart failure , hypokalemia , family history long QT interval syndrome ) Patients take medication know prolong QT interval unless transfer medication within ≥5 halflives prior dosing , unless medication properly monitor study . Patients know infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) active hepatitis B C Patients know dysphagia , shortgut syndrome , gastroparesis , condition limit ingestion gastrointestinal absorption drug administer orally Patients brain metastasis untreated , symptomatic , require therapy control symptom ; radiation , surgery , therapy , include use control symptom , within 1 month first dose Glioma patient evidence intracranial intratumoral hemorrhage either MRI CT scan</criteria>
