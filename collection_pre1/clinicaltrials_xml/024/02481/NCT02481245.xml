	<brief_summary>We propose test hypothesis bezafibrate , pan-PPAR agonist , may effective safe bipolar depression follow specific aim : Aim # 1 . Proof-of-Concept Safety Tolerability Aim : To assess safety tolerability bezafibrate add lithium bipolar depression , especially regard worsen manic symptom suicidal ideation . We conduct phase IIa , 8-week , open pilot trial bezafibrate add lithium 20 participant bipolar depression . We monitor change manic symptom ( Young Mania Rating Scale ) , suicidal ideation , cognitive functioning specifically attention verbal memory , treatment emergent adverse event ( SAFTEE ) . We also monitor change Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score . Aim # 2 . Preliminary Assessment Efficacy : To assess antidepressant efficacy bezafibrate add lithium acute bipolar I major depressive episode . In summary , propose 8-week , proof-of-concept open pilot trial adjunctive pan-PPAR agonist , bezafibrate , 20 patient acute bipolar I major depressive episode . The study may profound impact development novel treatment consistent mitochondrial dysregulation hypothesis bipolar disorder , best knowledge , first proof-of-concept trial ass pan-PPAR agonist bipolar disorder .</brief_summary>
