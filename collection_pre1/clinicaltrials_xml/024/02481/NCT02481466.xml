	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether dietary portfolio cholesterol-lowering food ( viscous fibre , soy protein , plant sterol nut ) enhance increased level monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) low glycemic index food ; together structure exercise program reduce progression carotid coronary atheromatous lesion , Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , blood pressure , reduce number individual require statin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Combined Portfolio Diet Exercise Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Presently Canada , 29 % death due cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , cost $ 20.9 billion annually . The investigator , therefore , bring together unique network investigator different stage career range discipline ( nutrition , cardiology , diabetes , exercise physiology , imaging , physic , clinical trial , statistic , laboratory medicine , primary care , genetics , psychology , knowledge translation ( KT ) , epidemiology ) , international recognition , experience connection , undertake Canada-wide , multi-centre study test ability effective cholesterol-lowering diet ( dietary portfolio ) exercise program , develop Laval University , 3 year reduce progression plaque build-up carotid artery assess Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) individual hypercholesterolemia type 2 diabetes . The dietary portfolio proven many study effective cholesterol-lowering diet enhance include feature dietary strategy investigator test develop ; high monounsaturated fat ( Mediterranean diet ) ( CMAJ 2010 ) low glycemic index food ( JAMA 2008 ) . The investigator plan recruit194 ( approximately 200 ) men postmenopausal woman , measurable thickening ( assess ultrasound ) due plaque build carotid artery , 1.5 year period 3 year study . Ultrasound selection individual intima-media thickness ( IMT ) &gt; 1mm relevant arterial thickening ensure relatively low risk majority group , yet measurable arterial thickening . Those select randomly assign receive advice either dietary Portfolio Plus diet increase physical activity ( test ) DASH-like diet routine physical activity ( control ) . The result study major influence dietary exercise guideline coronary heart disease ( CH risk reduction provide evidence large international trial focus hard endpoint , myocardial infarction ( MI ) CHD event ) . It hop cohort participant continue form part plan 9 year hard end point ( MACE ) study fund .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A ) Eligible participant men 21 year postmenopausal woman Having BMI 2540 kg/m2 whose body weight remain constant ( within ±2kg ) last 3 month precede onset study measurable arterial thickening ( &gt; 1.0mm ) screening assess ultrasound . They include : 1. type 2 diabetes one following : raise LDLcholesterol ( accordance 2012 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines ) raise BP ( ≥145/95mmHg ) , active smoking 2. nondiabetic subject post MI post percutaneous coronary intervention ( angioplasty ) statin therapy ; 3. hypercholesterolemic treat statin prescribed statin take either unable ( intolerant ) unwilling take statin drug . B ) Individuals follow condition exclude : cardiovascular disease precludes exercise e.g . recent stroke recent myocardial infarction cardiac condition severely compromise normal function mitral valve disease , heart failuregrades 24 ( base New York Heart Association classification ) , severe angina sufficient prevent form physical activity condition prevent exercise . clinical diagnosis familial hypercholesterolemia secondary cause hypercholesterolemia hypothyroidism ( unless treat stable dose Lthyroxine ) clinically significant renal liver disease uncontrolled blood pressure major disability disorder require continuous medical attention ( steroids Coumadin ) treatment , : chronic heart failure liver disease renal failure cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancerbasal cell , squamous cell ) chronic infection ( bacterial viral ) chronic inflammatory disease ( eg . lupus , ulcerative colitis , crohn 's disease , celiac disease gluten sensitivity ) autoimmune disease major surgery &lt; 6 month prior randomization newly diagnose diabetes ( &lt; 3 month ) alcohol consumption &gt; 3 drinks/d suitable MRI examination metal implant claustrophobia food allergy sensitivity study food study food component ( eg . tree nut , peanut , soy , wheat , gluten , oat , egg , milk ) already follow portfoliolike diet structured exercise program family doctor</criteria>
