	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Optimal Dose Remifentanil During MRI Heart Under General Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management congenital heart disease depend upon accurate image heart define anatomical abnormality . The use magnetic resonance image grow response need . Young child , however , unable cooperate sufficiently allow scan occur ; necessitates use general anaesthesia . The optimal anaesthetic management child situation complex . Imaging acceptable quality depend low ( normal ) heart rate relatively constant scan frequent breath hold avoid respiratory artefact . Children undergoing scan commonly significant cardiac non-cardiac disease . A technique , currently use Alder Hey Hospital , use intravenous agent provide anaesthesia : commonly mixture intravenous anaesthetic propofol potent opiate remifentanil . The patient 's ventilation suppress use remifentanil also reduce heart rate heart rate variability . Controlled ventilation provide via ventilator endotracheal tube . Adequate dose remifentanil required ensure suppression patient 's ventilation whilst excess dos avoid reduce risk adverse effect ( primarily arterial hypotension ) ensure rapid recovery . Remifentanil dose study surgery ( 3-6 ) , however unique indication optimal dosage formally study . In particular absence stimulation surgery likely mean substantially low dos remifentanil require .</detailed_description>
