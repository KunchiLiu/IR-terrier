	<brief_summary>Two Intensive Life Style Intervention Programs Related Caregivers Preschool Children Substantial stride make treatment acute cardiovascular condition , myocardial infarction stroke , however , global burden cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) continue rise alarm rate . Furthermore , despite abundant data demonstrate great burden CVD racial/ethnic minority , many specific intervention aim change risk factor pattern behavior racial/ethnic minority , health disparity persist . In present study , investigator seek evaluate impact multifaceted comprehensive lifestyle intervention couple atherosclerosis image reduce cardiovascular risk among minority adult live Harlem , New York . The investigator believe holistic , multi-dimensional individual peer-to-peer intensive lifestyle intervention involve parents/caregivers preschool child effective produce favorable change behavior , sustain time . The primary hypothesis study aggressive lifestyle intervention effective improve healthy behavior biological correlate at-risk adult parent and/or caregiver preschool child Harlem , NY . In aim 1 , initial pilot study , investigator identify contextual factor , facilitator barrier may impact implementation lifestyle intervention program adult Harlem , use qualitative research method . In aim 2 , investigator determine impact two intensive lifestyle intervention promote improve healthy behavior biological parameter low cardiovascular risk , impact knowledge presence atherosclerosis health behavior impact lifestyle intervention atherosclerosis among approximately 600 asymptomatic at-risk adult . Finally , aim 3 , investigator evaluate sustainability impact two intensive lifestyle intervention healthy behavior biological parameter 12 month intervention program end .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 - Pilot , 1st Year : To identify contextual factor , facilitator barrier may impact implementation lifestyle intervention program adult Harlem , use qualitative research method : 1 ) focus group discussion among representative cohort adult ; 2 ) focus group discussion among community leader ; 3 ) Pilot study feasibility intervention representative cohort adult . Subsidiary Aim 1.1 : To use identified facilitator barrier develop contextually culturally appropriate model adult lifestyle intervention program . Subsidiary Aim 1.2 : To implement pilot intervention contextually culturally adapt program among sample parents/caregivers child preschool Harlem . The investigator assess acceptability feasibility , make necessary modification prior implementation cluster-randomized trial . This aim carry 2 preschool Harlem , NY include parent caregiver pre-school child . The final intervention program result intervention-mapping program pilot parent group 10 . Aim 2 - Randomization , 2nd 3rd Year : To determine ( ) impact two intensive lifestyle intervention promote improve healthy behavior ( increased physical activity , smoke cessation etc . ) biological parameter ( lipid , sugar ) low cardiovascular risk , ( ii ) impact presence atherosclerosis health behavior ( iii ) impact lifestyle intervention atherosclerosis among approximately 600 asymptomatic at-risk adult . Hypothesis : Adults receive lifestyle intervention program demonstrate great improvement healthy behavior biological parameter compare control whose intervention receive Children program . Hypothesis : Knowledge presence atherosclerosis define 3D US lead great improvement healthy behavior . Hypothesis : Adults receive lifestyle intervention program demonstrate less progression regression 3-D ultrasound quantify atherosclerosis compare control . For aim , investigator recruit parent caregiver pre-school child twenty school Harlem , NY perform 2:1 ( 2 intervention , 1 control ) cluster randomization school . Those `` intensive intervention '' group randomly assign one two interventions- Intensive Individual Intervention Program '' ( IIIP ) develop intervention map program describe aim 1 'Peer-To-Peer Program - Intervention '' ( PPPI ) , refine pilot phase . The intervention program continue 24 month . Assessments perform 6 month ( early-effect ) , 12 month ( interim-effect ) end intervention ( peak-effect ) . The outcome composite score consist 0-3 scale behaviors/outcomes related Blood pressure , Exercise , Weight , Alimentation ( diet ) Tobacco ( smoke ) [ Fuster-BEWAT score ] . Participants also undergo point care test lipid panel blood sugar assessment , 3-D ultrasound ( US ) imaging ( carotid , ileo-femoral ) ass presence atherosclerosis . The result 3-D ultrasound share participant evaluate impact behavior change . Aim 3 - Sustainability , 4th Year : To evaluate sustainability impact two intensive lifestyle intervention healthy behavior biological parameter 12 month intervention program end . Hypothesis : Adult caregiver receive intensive lifestyle approach program two year , maintain sustainability advantage two `` Intensive Interventional group '' control `` Traditional Health Education '' group . All participant follow 12 month end intervention period reassess Fuster-BEWAT Score .</detailed_description>
