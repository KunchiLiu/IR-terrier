	<brief_summary>The study aim answering question ; ( 1 ) How well commonly use treatment iSGS work ? ( 2 ) What quality-of-life trade-off associate approach ? With result trial , investigator hope provide information iSGS patient : ( 1 ) Given personal characteristic , condition , preference , I expect happen ? ( 2 ) What option , potential benefit harm option ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Idiopathic subglottic stenosis ( iSGS ) rare disease trachea narrow know reason . Although uncommon ( estimate incidence 1:400,000 person per year ) , disease therapy profoundly affect patient ' ability breathe , communicate swallow . Breathing difficulty ( i.e . dyspnea ) hallmark symptom primary cause death disability . However , patient also experience debilitate voice change swallow problem due condition treatment . People disease often require several surgery per year . A variety treatment advanced manage iSGS generally categorize : 1 ) endoscopic dilation tracheal stenosis ( accomplished rigid instrument inflatable balloon ) ; 2 ) endoscopic resection stenosis ( prolonged medical therapy surgery ) ; 3 ) open neck surgery resection affect tracheal segment end-to-end anastomosis . Each patient require repeat surgery keep trachea open , increase odds treatment side effect complication . All approach unique often disable associate side effect , significantly affect patient 's quality life . Because disease rare , difficult patient find good information understand spectrum treatment option . This particularly difficult patient present severe breathe trouble need treatment quickly , limit ability explore option . Additionally , general lack high-quality , reliable , accessible data inform individual patient decision-making . Imperfect information limit evidence treatment outcome complicate patient decision-making try balance survival , symptom , quality life consideration . Beyond gap understand relative effectiveness different treatment available , study explore functional outcome iSGS ( i.e . well patient breathe , speak , swallow treatment ) . These endpoint important patient arguably primary determinant decision-making . Direct engagement patient critical understand quality life consideration , since patient physician perspectives n't always . For example , result show endoscopic dilation associate high rate disease recurrence thus need repeat surgery . Meanwhile , open tracheal resection major surgery significant immediate perioperative risk associate alteration voice swallow . Open tracheal resection appear reduce risk disease recurrence , degree benefit , trade-off associate approach unanswered question . The propose study North American Airway Collaborative ( NoAAC PR- 02 ) design fill void . Our prospective study directly compare effectiveness standard care treatment assess associate quality life tradeoff iSGS patient .</detailed_description>
