	<brief_summary>Diabetes associate substantially increase risk heart failure , associate substantial morbidity mortality . Despite development new therapeutic strategy improve glycemic control , recent clinical data saxagliptin assessment vascular outcome record patient diabetes mellitus-thrombolysis myocardial infarction ( SAVOR-TIMI ) 53 study observe unexpected finding excess adjudicate heart failure hospitalization . This excess occur set pre-existing heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization elevate biomarkers heart failure N terminal pro Brain type natriuretic peptide ( NT-pro BNP ) . A wealth preclinical data suggest mechanistic basis excess heart failure event , however preclinical study primarily focus upon prevention base strategy oppose regression study establish heart failure present . This proposal seek understand dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor ( DPP4i , specifically saxagliptin ) may influence development heart failure , evaluate change cardiac structure function use cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The cardiovascular safety potential cardioprotective effect diabetes drug focus recent research . Currently , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) require new anti-diabetic drug demonstrate important increase cardiovascular adverse event approval . Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor ( gliptins ) oral incretin-based agent increase glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) level , proven anti-hyperglycemic effect increasingly use management type 2 diabetes . In rat model diabetes myocardial infarction , sitagliptin treatment improve passive leave ventricular compliance , increase endothelial cell density , reduce myocyte hypertrophy collagen abundance . GLP-1 DDP-4 inhibition vildagliptin improve cardiac function , cardiac remodeling , survival animal model pressure-overload chronic heart failure . However , another study post-MI cardiac remodeling mouse , vildagliptin fail show early late protective effect cardiac function . Some clinical study suggest GLP-1 infusion associate absolute increase leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) patient heart failure , although data conflict . The GLP-1 receptor analog , exenatide may reduce infarct size patient myocardial infarction improve LVEF . The Cardiovascular Outcomes Study Alogliptin Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Acute Coronary Syndrome EXAMINE trial randomize assigned 5340 patient type 2 diabetes recent acute coronary syndrome alogliptin placebo , find increase adverse cardiovascular event alogliptin group . In SAVOR-TIMI 53 , 16,492 patient type 2 diabetes history , risk , cardiovascular event randomize receive saxagliptin placebo . Over median follow-up 2.1 year , primary composite endpoint cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , ischemic stroke differ significantly 2 group ( P=0.99 superiority ; P &lt; 0.001 noninferiority ) . However , patient saxagliptin group likely hospitalize heart failure , ascertain EXAMINE trial . Furthermore , Sitagliptin Cardiovascular Outcome Study ( TECOS ) , examine DPP4i sitagliptin versus placebo high risk patient cardiovascular event demonstrate cardiovascular safety ( P &lt; 0.001 non inferiority ) , signal excess heart failure hospitalization . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) emerge `` gold standard '' measure LV volume , mass , ejection fraction . LV volume measurement cardiac MRI rely geometric assumption . CMR measurement excellent intra-observer , inter-observer , inter-study variability , superior image technique . The high inter-study reproducibility CMR affords substantial reduction require sample size demonstrate even small change LV volume , LV mass LVEF , conversely , reliably exclude clinically important change . Furthermore , CMR tag allows detail quantitative assessment regional LV diastolic systolic function . For example , Multiethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) , CMR detect subtle alteration global regional LV function patient traditional novel cardiovascular risk factor . Although prior study fail demonstrate beneficial effect improve glycemic control myocardial function , CMR promise sensitive accurate technique . Accordingly , investigator propose use CMR examine cardiac structure , global regional function among patient type 2 diabetes treat saxagliptin .</detailed_description>
