	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect , good bad new drug call ixazomib ( also call MLN9708 ) , give along common treatment combination , call Dose-Adjusted EPOCH-R ( DA-EPOCH-R , short ) . This type study call phase I/II trial . In phase I part , dose study drug ( ixazomib ) adjust ( either ) find maximum ( high ) dose cause excessive ( many ) harmful side effect . In phase II part , dose ixazomib give maximum safe dose find phase I . In phase I II , DA-EPOCH-R adjust cycle depend blood cell level affect cycle . Ixazomib consider investigational approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . DA-EPOCH-R combination chemotherapy treatment develop last 14-15 year , drug regimen FDA-approved consider part standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety ixazomib ( ixazomib citrate ) give dose-adjusted etoposide , prednisone , vincristine ( vincristine sulfate ) , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) , rituximab ( DA-EPOCH-R ) patient aggressive , v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog ( MYC ) -aberrant lymphoid malignancy , determine recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate efficacy , measure 12-month progression free survival ( PFS ) , ixazomib give DA-EPOCH-R patient aggressive , MYC-aberrant lymphoid malignancy . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Further evaluate frequency severity toxicity . II . Further evaluate clinical efficacy , measure response rate overall survival ( OS ) . III . Assess predictive value fludeoxyglucose F-18 ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) scan PFS . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine impact cell origin ( COO ) upon response rate , PFS , OS . II . Assess feasibility outcomes consolidation stem cell transplant ( SCT ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study ixazomib citrate follow phase II study . INDUCTION : Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally ( PO ) day 1 day 8 15 ; etoposide intravenously ( IV ) , vincristine sulfate IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously 96 hour day 1-4 ; prednisone PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-5 ; rituximab IV start 50 mg/hr , increase 50-mg/hr increment every 30 minute maximum rate 400 mg/hr day 1 ; cyclophosphamide IV 90 minute day 5 . CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM ( CNS ) PROPHYLAXIS : Patients negative lumbar puncture ( LP ) receive methotrexate intrathecally ( IT ) per course . Patients positive LP receive methotrexate IT intraventricularly OR cytarabine IT intraventricularly OR methotrexate IT intraventricularly , cytarabine IT intraventricularly , therapeutic hydrocortisone IT intraventricularly . MAINTENANCE : Patients treat consolidative SCT , receive ixazomib citrate PO BID day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day one year ( long deriving benefit ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
