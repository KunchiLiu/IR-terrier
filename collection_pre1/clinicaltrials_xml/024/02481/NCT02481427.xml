	<brief_title>Finnish Unicompartmental Total Knee Arthroplasty Investigation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) common joint disease , may cause severe pain lead reduce quality life . It show prevalence symptomatic OA age 60 9.6 % men 18 % woman . Primary treatment knee OA conservative include physical activity , exercise analgesic . Meta-analysis show small moderately sized effect exercise pain function . Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) gold standard option treatment painful OA knee conservative treatment sufficient . Unicondylar knee arthroplasty ( UKA ) use treatment knee OA isolate single compartment instead TKA . Both UKA TKA use decade treatment knee OA . However , operative indication TKA UKA overlap , similar . Therefore , outcome survivorship procedure compare directly . Some advantage UKA TKA report , include faster recovery time , reduce perioperative morbidity mortality , subjective preference feel normal knee , low cost improve return work sport . On side national arthroplasty register like National Joint Registry England Wales ( NJR ) , Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry ( AOANJRR ) , Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register ( SKAR ) , Finnish Arthroplasty Register ( FAR ) consistently report around threefold increase crude cumulative revision rate 8 10 year UKA compare TKA 7-10 . Few report publish patient-perceived outcome follow TKA compare UKA . Newman et compare fixed bearing UKA TKA publish good range movement ( ROM ) UKA . Sun PF et compare mobile bear UKA fix bear TKA . They n't significant difference ROM Knee Society score ( KSS ) postoperatively mean 52 month follow-up , TKA group significantly postoperative deep vein thrombosis blood loss . A study compare cement UKA ( Oxford , Biomet ) TKA , publish use patient-perceived outcome measure , study protocol lack blind . There publish randomize control , double-blind trial compare patient-perceived outcome TKA UKA . Oxford mobile bear UKA use unicondylar prosthesis accord national registry . The common reason revision UKA accord NJR aseptic loosening , account 48 % UKA revision . Other reason UKA revision Finland malalignment , prosthesis fracture , instability , infection , fracture , patella complication reason ( 35 % ) . A randomized control trial 62 knee compare cemented cementless Oxford UKA demonstrate greatly reduce incidence tibial radiolucencies similar functional outcome 1 year 15 . Cementless Oxford unicondylar knee relative new product develop address problem related cement fixation , demonstrate randomise study similar clinical outcome few radiolucencies observe cemented device . New Zealand Joint Registry ( NZJR ) data show revision rate 1,37/100 component year cement Oxford phase 3 0,72/100 component year cementless Oxford phase 3 UKA . The uncemented Oxford UKA significantly low revision rate overall mean 1.27 /100 observer component year . Also NJR show well survivorship cementless unicondylar arthroplasty compare cement unicondylar arthroplasty . On hand cementless TKA show low survivorship compare cement TKA Finnish Arthroplasty Register ( FAR ) . There publish randomize control , double-blind trial compare patient-perceived outcome cement TKA cementless Oxford UKA . The aim study The aim study compare functional , clinical , patient satisfaction , implant survival result cementless UKA cement TKA 2 month , 1 , 2 , 5 10 year procedure . Study set The study design multicenter , double-blind randomize trial knee replacement patient . Arthroplasty procedure perform experienced knee surgeon experience UKA TKA operation . As UKA use cementless Oxford phase 3 mobile bear prosthesis Microplasty instrumentation ( Biomet ) TKA cement Triathlon CR condylar prothesis ( Stryker ) . According power analysis , go recruit 140 patient 3 orthopedic unit Finland . Participants randomize UKR TKR . Study participants Participants anteromedial osteoarthritis knee include study . Patients must applicable medial UKR TKR . Recruitment consent Potential patient contact outpatient clinic participate orthopedic surgeon . At stage patient provide 'Invitation letter ' information sheet explain approach provide detail study . Those patient , voluntary take part study , screen inclusion exclusion criterion . If patient appropriate study , pre-assessment clinic appointment organize . The pre-assessment appointment routine appointment short time schedule operation date . Study assessment Preoperative assessment include patient report questionnaire examining pain , Symptoms , function daily living , function sport recreation knee relate Quality life . ( OKS KOOS ) . Also clinical assessment range motion function knee , carry . Preoperative weight bear X-rays knee 20 degrease flexion , valgus stress x-rays mechanical axis also take . After operation , operative detail record routine postoperative radiograph collect . Operative detail seal save . Code open randomization cancel 's necessary . Reasons might result cancellation randomization , example , symptom operate knee might require revision arthroplasty . Cancellation randomization occur also patient want discontinue participate study . Control outpatient policlinic appointment arrange clinical examination 2 month , 1 , 2 , 5 10 year post operation . Outpatient control carry orthopedic surgeon , aware type operation -UKA TKA - performed . Range movement stability assess . The radiograph available patient outpatient policlinic , control radiologist orthopedic surgeon complication . Patients informed surgical complication possible abnormal finding X-rays , treat use standard method . A postal questionnaire ( contain 15D , OKS KOOS ) send 2 month , 1 , 2 , 5 10 year post randomization . Additional clinical appointment ( need ) perform surgeon participate study operation control . Randomisation 2 24 hour operation , patient confirm eligible trial , surgeon open envelope contain study-group assignment ( TKA UKA ) . The assignment reveal patient . The sequentially number , seal envelope prepared statistician involvement clinical care patient trial . Randomizations perform 1:1 ratio block size 4 . The randomization sequence involve stratification accord age ( 45 60 61 79 year age ) , sex , preoperative OKS ( 0-17 , 18-27 , 28-48 ) . Only orthopedic surgeon staff operate room aware group assignment , participate treatment follow-up patient . Total knee replacement procedure TKA perform standard medial parapatellar incision , provide easy access knee joint . Skin incision do midline . Intramedullary guide use alignment femoral tibia saw cut component position . Components cemented position . The patella resurface . Intraoperative local infiltration analgesia ( LIA ) use postoperative pain management . Drain use . Partial knee replacement procedure UKA involve replacement affect medial compartment . In study , operation perform standard medial parapatellar incision midline skin incision , knee joint fascia open like standard Oxford minimally invasive incision . The procedure perform use Oxford Microplasty instrumentation follow Microplasty surgical technique ( Biomet Orthopedics ) . Intraoperative local infiltration analgesia use postoperative pain management . Drain use . Safety The study participant symptomatic medial knee OA fail conservative treatment . Patients , suitable knee replacement select outpatient clinic . The operation perform standard knee replacement . The study participant inform risk associate anesthesia knee replacement surgery . Potential intra- perioperative complication ; anesthesia-related complication , wound infection , bleeding , fracture , rupture collateral patellar ligament , thrombo-embolic complication , death , ongoing pain , deterioration exist co-morbidity . Surgical long-term complication follow knee replacement loosen implant , lack osteointegration cementless implant , periprosthetic fracture , luxation- wear bearing , infection , adverse knee pain 12 month operation , knee stiffness , lateral compartment OA UKA . These complication may need surgery revision , open debridement , washout bad even amputation . Ethics study registration We approval institutional review board Ethics Committee , Hospital District Southwest Finland .</detailed_description>
