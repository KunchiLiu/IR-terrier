	<detailed_description>VX15/2503-N-131 Phase 2 , multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo control study VX15/2503 subject late prodromal early manifest Huntington 's disease . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability monthly IV administration single dosage VX15/2503 ( placebo ) . Secondary objective include determine effect VX15/2503 brain volume ( MRI ) , FDG-PET imaging , 11C-PBR28 ( TSPO ) PET image ( Cohort B ) clinical feature HD include cognition , motor function , behavior , functional ability , global function . Additional secondary objective include PK / PD , immunogenicity , exploratory biomarkers . Subjects Cohort B receive 12 month VX15/2503 volunteer undergo lumbar puncture V13 collect cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) evaluate VX15/2503 mAb concentration , total sSEMA4D level , biomarkers CSF . Enrollment involve approximately 116 individual 21 year age old late prodromal ( CAG-age product score ( CAP score ) great 200 Diagnostic Confidence Level ( DCL ) 2 3 ) early manifest HD ( Total Functional Capacity ( TFC ) great equal 11 ) . The study divide Cohort A Cohort B. Cohort A subject treat 6 month either drug placebo ( 1:1 ) subject treat drug 6 month , follow 3 month follow . Treatment duration subject Cohort A 12 month . Participation Cohort A include Screening visit , Baseline visit within 30 day screen ; 12 monthly treatment visit begin baseline continue Month 12 ; follow-up safety phone call one month follow-up safety visit three month final infusion . Cohort A subject participate study approximately 16 month . Cohort B subject treat drug placebo ( 1:1 ) 18 month , follow 3 month follow . Treatment duration subject Cohort B 18 month . Participation Cohort B include Screening visit , Baseline visit within 30 day screen ; 18 monthly treatment visit begin baseline continue Month 18 ; follow-up safety phone call one month follow-up safety visit three month final infusion . Cohort B subject participate study approximately 22 month .</detailed_description>
