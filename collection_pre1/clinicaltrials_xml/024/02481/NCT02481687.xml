	<brief_title>The Value I-Scan Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy Assessment Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The value I-Scan Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy assessment chronic inflammatory bowel disease Background Colonoscopy play important role diagnosis , assessment activity , extension response therapy chronic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Conventional examination underestimate extent activity disease compare histology , therefore , mucosal biopsy critical component endoscopic examination patient . Taking multiple biopsy time consuming , carry low negligible risk secondary hemorrahage , cause delay diagnosis , whilst await histological analysis . Confocal laser endomicroscopy emerge recent year novel technique actually enable vivo microscopic analysis ongoing endoscopy . Endomicroscopy perform either dedicate endoscope ( eCLE ) miniprobe-based system ( pCLE ) [ 1 ] . It contrast base technique , widely use agent intravenously administer fluorescein [ 2 ] . The probe-based endomicroscopy system consist flexible catheter probe represent bundle optical fiber link micro-objective , laser scan unit control acquisition software ( Cellvizio ; Mauna Kea Technology , Paris , France ) . The flexible confocal miniprobes specifically design pass work channel standard endoscope , biliary catheter cholangioscopes thus pCLE system easily integrate endoscopy unit . The principle technique base laser beam define wavelength focus towards target tissue recapture signal displayed 'optical biopsy ' single horizontal plane . The potential role CLE explore pathology upper low gastrointestinal tract , show good accuracy predict final histopathological diagnosis base immediate evaluation tissue vascular pattern [ 3 ] . Because minute scan area , techology best use conjunction `` red-flag '' technique screen mucosa area interest , examine CLE histological diagnosis [ 4 ] . I-scan technology ( Pentax , Tokyo , Japan ) new image-enhanced endoscopic technique , consist three type algorithm : surface enhancement ( SE ; enhancement structure recognition edge ) , contrast enhancement ( CE ; enhancement depress area difference structure color presentation low density area ) tone enhancement ( TE ; enhancement tailor individual organ modification combination RGB component pixel ) [ 5,6 ] . Like narrow band image i-scan achieve virtual chromoendoscopy , study determine role technology evaluation activity inflammatory bowel disease [ 7 ] . Aim study The aim study compare image finding p-CLE conjunction I-scan endoscopy activity score histological diagnosis . Patients methods The study prospectively include patient active ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease meet inclusion exclusion criterion . All patient examine conventional colonoscopy , follow I-scan examination p-CLE , biopsy sample take segment colon . Then , correlation histology `` gold standard '' , activity score ( Mayo score ulcerative colitis , respectively Crohn 's Disease Activity Index Crohn 's disease ) image finding calculate pathological normal area . Inclusion criterion - Age &gt; 18 year old , male female - Patients diagnose active ulcerative colitis ( MAYO score &gt; 3 ) Crohn 's disease ( CDAI score &gt; 150 ) , indication treatment colonoscopy exists . Newly diagnose well patient already oral 5-ASA therapy , may include . - Signed informed consent colonoscopy p-CLE examination Exclusion criterion - Failure provide inform consent - Patients contraindication colonoscopy - Known allergy fluorescein - Pregnant breast-feeding patient - Ongoing systemic immunosuppressive therapy prednisolone , azathioprine biological agent . Data collect participant include : - Personal data ( name , surname , age , sex ) - Results previous investigation - Clinical evaluation ( stools frequency , rectal bleeding , fever , abdominal pain , extra intestinal manifestation , abdominal mass ) blood count activity index calculator ( Mayo score ulcerative colitis , respectively CDAI score Crohn disease ) - Endoscopic finding - Histological immunohistochemical finding - Molecular analysis finding Imaging test - All patient examine I-scan colonoscopy degree distribution acute inflammation assess . - p-CLE examination follow , intravenous administration contrast agent ( 2.5 ml fluorescein 10 % ) , every segment colon normal pathological area . - Image data store digitally offline analysis ( 10-20 second movie area examine ) . - Biopsy sample take area examine p-CLE histological , immunohistochemical molecular analysis . The biological material collect study ( include one ml whole blood tissue biopsy normal tissue modify area 2 3 mm ) frozen store . When expect number participant reach sample undergo molecular study assess marker angiogenesis detail protocol . The biological material store analyzed estimate time 18 month start trial . After completion study biomaterials dispose . Biological sample molecular test : - Blood sample collect image procedure 1 . For DNA extraction 2-5 ml blood collect tub contain EDTA store 4°C day transfer -80°C freezer longer storage 2 . For RNA extraction 2-5 ml blood must collect PAX tub keep maximum 2 hour room temperature transfer -80°C freezer longer storage - Tissue sample : Possible method stabilize tissue sample molecular analysis ( RNA/DNA/protein ) : 1 . 0,3-0,5 cm tissue store immediately tube contain RNAlater Solution approximately 24 hour 4°C ; RNAlater solution take tube ( sterile condition ) sample frozen -80°C RNA/DNA extraction . 2 . 0,3-0,5 cm tissue store immediately empty cryogenic tube thrown container contains liquid nitrogen dry ice methanol . Primary Outcome Measures : - p-CLE finding record compare finding conventional colonoscopy I-scan colonoscopy . - p-CLE I-scan colonoscopy finding compare pathological evaluation tissue sample . Secondary Outcome Measures : - Effect therapy , base result conventional colonoscopy , I-scan p-CLE - Registering time procedure . - Registering possible complication Risks side effect Complications may occur colonoscopy , rare . These consist bleed biopsy site usually minimal , self-limited rarely require follow-up . Perforation bowel extremely rare . The safety profile contrast agent ( fluorescein ) show low incidence side effect . It nephrotoxic incidence hypersensitivity severe allergic event low . Fluorescein approve clinical use EU country .</detailed_description>
