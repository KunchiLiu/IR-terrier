	<brief_summary>In study investigator examine effect dopamine ( bromocriptine ) insulin sensitivity lean obese subject . Furthermore , investigator examine whether time bromocriptine administration influence insulin sensitivity . To , investigator include lean obese subject use 2 time 2 week bromocriptine . In randomized order , use morning evening . The investigator examine insulin sensitivity perform 7-point oral glucose tolerance test . Furthermore , investigator examine energy expenditure subject keep track eat behaviour 3 day study visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bromocriptine Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bromocriptine , dopamine 2 receptor agonist , recently approve treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2 ) . Bromocriptine cause significant improvement fast plasma glucose Hba1C value . The exact mechanism action bromocriptine still unknown . Earlier , investigator perform study show effect bromocriptine brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) activity ( DEBAT study ( Medisch Etische Toetsingscommissie ) METC nr 2013_107 ) . Namely , BAT , know capacity dissipate excess energy , might involve process stimulation sympathetic nervous system principal drive force control BAT activity . However , investigator show bromocriptine influence BAT activity energy expenditure healthy , lean subject . The investigator find effect bromocriptine insulin sensitivity unexpectedly , subject become significantly less insulin sensitive bromocriptine use . Circadian neuroendocrine rhythm , especially dopaminergic serotonergic neurotransmitter activity , play pivotal role development seasonal non-seasonal change body fat store insulin sensitivity . Therefore , time bromocriptine administration might great importance change insulin sensitivity . Indeed , treatment DM2 , bromocriptine quick release variant give morning . In former study investigator instruct subject use bromocriptine evening combination even meal . The investigator decide bromocriptine take combination food . The investigator want high level dopamine 18F-Fludeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan get maximum effect dopamine BAT . But subject fast OGTT 18F-FDG-PET-CT scan . Therefore , investigator decide give ( long-acting ) bromocriptine evening . Also , effect bromocriptine might different lean obese subject . Obesity associate increase sympathetic tonus . Therefore , baseline condition different lean obese subject may cause different effect bromocriptine treatment . In study investigator aim investigate whether timing ( e.g . morning evening ) bromocriptine administration ( 1,25mg/day first week 2,50mg/day second week ) different effect insulin sensitivity lean obese male . At visit 1 : Informed consent , medical history , vital sign laboratory measurement obtain . The investigator also perform oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , energy expenditure ( EE ) measurement 60 minute bed rest . After visit 1 : subject start use bromocriptine ( 1,25mg/day first week 2,50mg/day second week ) randomization timing : morning evening . Visit 2 : EE 60 minute rest . OGTT . 2 week washout period Visit 3 : EE 60 minute rest . OGTT . After visit 3 : start use bromocriptine ( 1,25mg/day first week 2,50mg/day second week ) time point . Visit 4 : EE 60 minute rest . OGTT .</detailed_description>
