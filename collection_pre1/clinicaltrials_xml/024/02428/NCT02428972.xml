	<brief_summary>Primary brain tumor highly associate neurocognitive deficit poor quality life . There number study indicate brain tumor treatment modality often related cognitive dysfunction . Apart primary brain lesion , deficit also occur Surgery , Radiotherapy , Chemotherapy , Antiepileptic Corticosteroid treatment.Anaesthesia also add cognitive deficit patient . According Ali et al . propofol provide good cognition score compare sevoflurane isoflurane . The primary aim study compare effect 3 anesthetic regimen hemodynamics recovery characteristic patient . However another study Magni et al. , author find difference early cognitive function sevoflurane propofol . The aim prospective , randomize , open-label clinical trial compare clinical property sevoflurane-fentanyl propofol-remifentanil anesthesia patient undergo supratentorial intracranial surgery . However study evaluate early cognitive function . The primary endpoint compare early postoperative recovery cognitive function within two group . They also evaluate hemodynamic event , vomit , shiver , pain . The literature scarce severity , incidence effect anaesthetic cognition quality life patient . Since patient brain tumor cure surgery alone , improvement quality life palliative care symptom cognitive function important part treatment . Now cognitive function also consider independent prognostic factor survival patient brain tumor . Cognitive function also related tumor laterality . Patients tumor leave hemisphere low score verbal test , whereas tumor right hemisphere low score facial recognition test . Patients tumor leave hemisphere report difficulty concentrate right-hemisphere lesion , report tension . Patients primary brain tumor also experience serious challenge quality life ( QOL ) . These patient may face motor deficit , personality change , cognitive deficit , aphasia , visual field defect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive dysfunction common complication primary metastatic brain tumor correlate disease various treatment modality . The symptom cognitive deficit may include problem memory , attention information processing . There study suggest psychological distress important factor reduce health relate QOL patient brain tumor . However study , depression find another important independent predictor QOL strong impact survival . QOL extensive term comprise physical functional status , emotional well-being , social well-being . It study QOL patient high-grade tumor differ grade III grade IV tumor . Compared patient non-CNS cancer , brain tumor patient report fatigue , cognitive dysfunction , alter mood state . However , different level impairment observe patient brain tumor . To spread awareness illness , psychiatric intervention may useful patient . Cognitive dysfunction may affect basic function include attention behavior advance function like take decision make plan . According Yoshii Y et.al , Cognitive dysfunction surgery may correlate stage tumor malignancy degree tumor resection . Cognitive function correlate increased fatigue depression newly diagnose malignant glioma patient . After approval Institute Ethics Committee consent patient guardian , include adult patient 18 - 65 year , either gender schedule craniotomy supratentorial brain tumor . We exclude patient history previous surgery brain tumor , emergency surgery non-consenting patient . To calculate sample size first conduct pilot study enrol 30 patient , 15 group . Block randomization follow block size 10 patient . Patients randomize use computer generate program . Demographic detail note . Patients adequately fast prior elective surgery . A standard anaesthesia protocol follow patient . Patients randomize two group , Group S ( Inhalational ) Group P ( Intravenous ) . .Allocation group perform use opaque seal envelope method . General anaesthesia induce Propofol 1.5 - 2 mg/kg.Anaesthesia maintain either propofol ( Group P ) Sevoflurane ( Group S ) along mixture oxygen air [ 1:1 ] flow rate 2 liter per minute..The Minimum Alveolar Concentration ( MAC ) Sevoflurane would maintain 0.8 - 1.2 . In Group P , depth anaesthesia guide clinical sign tachycardia hypertension . Intra-operative analgesia muscle relaxation provide bolus fentanyl 1 mcg/kg vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg , respectively . Intra-operative monitoring include ECG , heart rate , invasive non-invasive blood pressure , gas , end-tidal carbon dioxide , pulse oximetry , temperature fluid input output . Mannitol 1 gm/kg would administer period 20 minute time skin incision . Immediately craniotomy , brain relaxation would assess use Brain Relaxation Score ( BRS ) blind surgeon ass condition brain 1 = perfectly relax , 2 = satisfactorily relax , 3 = firm ( level ) brain , 4 = bulge brain . ( 27 ) At end surgery , propofol would discontinue begin skin closure Sevoflurane end skin closure . Neuromuscular block reverse neostigmine 0.1 mg/kg glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg . If patient plan elective mechanical ventilation post-operative period , neuromuscular block reverse . Emergence extubation time note . Emergence time define time discontinuation anaesthetic time follow verbal command eye opening . Extubation time define time anesthetic discontinuation tracheal extubation . Recovery patient assess use modified Aldrete score . Intraoperative postoperative complication , , note . Various complication ( tachycardia , bradycardia , hypotension , hypertension ) treat fentanyl , atropine , mephentramine labetalol . All patient shift ICU supportive care management . Cognitive function would assess preoperatively ( baseline ) , 2 3 hour postoperative , 24 hour post-operative , three month six month . Quality life ( QOL ) assess three month , six month one year . Cognitive function assess memory , learn , executive functioning , sustain attention verbal fluency QOL neuro-psychologist show Appendix . The difference brain relaxation two grade two study group consider clinically significant sample size calculated basis . Appendix NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT FUNCTION TEST [ 1 ] : Memory &amp; Learning , TEST : Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( AVLT ) , DOMAINS : Verbal Memory , Learning &amp; Retention , TIME TAKEN : 20 minute , AVAILABILITY : Property Clinical Neuropsychology ( CNP ) .
