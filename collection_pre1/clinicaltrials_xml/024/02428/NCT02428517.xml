	<brief_title>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( 2015 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( AlloHCT ) recommend post-remission therapy patient adult ALL , reduce intensity conditioning tried decrease treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) rate . Recent result show reduced intensity conditioning safely effectively use alloHCT adult patient ALL . However , reduce intensity conditioning ( RIC ) increase possibility hematologic relapse , especially due reduce anti-leukemic effect . Another challenge perform alloHCT ALL donor availability - limited availability match sibling donor ( MSD ) well-matched unrelated donor ( WMUD ) force u find feasibility alternative donor partially-matched unrelated donor ( PMUD ) haploidentical familial donor ( familial mismatch donor , FMD ) . The previous study ( NCT0137764 ) investigator perform show use RIC alternative donor feasible . However , incidence relapse slightly high among patient receive RIC investigator analyze interim analysis result . Especially , graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) incidence relatively higher among patient receive alloHCT MSD , investigator think addition antithymocyte globulin reduce incidence GVHD patient . In study , dose busulfan increase recipient 55 year old , irrespective donor type . The investigator also define partially match donor exactly find feasibility PMUD FMD . Another endpoint study find whether addition antithymocyte globulin may helpful prevent GVHD incidence patient receive alloHCT MSD without increase chance hematologic relapse .</detailed_description>
