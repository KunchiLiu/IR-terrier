	<brief_title>Platelet Reactivity Inhibition Following Ticagrelor Loading Dose One Year Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use thienopyridines patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) dramatically decrease rate early stent thrombosis . Further CURE trial demonstrate long-term clopidogrel decrease rate major adverse cardiovascular event acute coronary syndrome patient ( ACS ) . However clopidogrel several limitation include long delay action potential limitation acute setting coronary artery disease . Another major limitation drug wide inter individual variability clopidogrel responsiveness relate various factor . In addition recent study suggest platelet reactivity inhibition also determine bleed risk . The ticagrelor new blocker receiver P2Y12 distinguish clopidogrel superior biological efficiency . This biological property translate study PLATO , compare clopidogrel ACS , reduction risk thrombotique . The ticagrelor thus recommend first intention indication . There seem variability answer ticagrelor . Besides ticagrelor infers level intense platelet inhibition could explain hemorrhagic risk associate .</detailed_description>
