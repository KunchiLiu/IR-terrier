	<detailed_description>Children neuromuscular disability limit ambulation significant risk decrease bone mineral density ( BMD ) increase incidence fracture . This cause , part , low level load experience skeleton due child 's functional limitation . Low BMD show predictive fracture , fact , fracture usually occur without significant trauma child neuromuscular condition cerebral palsy , spinal muscular atrophy , muscular dystrophy . The discomfort distress fracture population considerable , associated cost family healthcare system substantial . Numerous intervention devote improve BMD child . Stationary assist stand device widely use represent standard-of-care . However , evidence support approach limit due inadequate study design insufficient number patient . Various modification add assisted-standing device allow child neuromuscular impairment achieve stand posture . These customizations lead load-sharing standing device , consequently , decrease amount load pass low extremity . Previous investigator develop custom-made load-measuring sensor quantify amount load borne low extremity passive stander , find actual load vary 23-102 % child 's body weight . These load-measuring sensor specifically develop restricted laboratory testing , rather record load magnitude duration stand brand stand device daily use home , school therapy . We previously develop load-sensing platform accurately measure load experience low extremity child cerebral palsy passive stander . These platform incorporate stander design , able use routine basis child 's home , school therapy , able record duration weight-bearing monitor compliance . This study use load-sensing platform patient neuromuscular condition . Successful completion pilot study assist development future multicenter clinical trial definitively determine relationship , , passive standing measure BMD , fracture incidence , pulmonary function , health-related quality-of-life measure child variety neuromuscular disability ( e.g. , spinal muscular atrophy , cerebral palsy , muscular dystrophy , spina bifida , Rett syndrome ) .</detailed_description>
