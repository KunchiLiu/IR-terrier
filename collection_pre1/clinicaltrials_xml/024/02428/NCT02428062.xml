	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Post-operative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) define spectrum postoperative central nervous system dysfunction acute persistent , include subtle neurologic sign neuropsychological impairment . The incidence POCD clearly associate age patient , old patient susceptible neurologic impairment follow anesthesia surgery . Due increase life expectances ameliorate surgical anesthesiologic technique , elderly people undergo surgical procedure . In respect , POCD complication need take account perioperative course elderly patient , especially reduced neurological functional reserve capacity high prevalence comorbidities . It worth underline occurrence POCD bring important subjective burden quality life patient also outstanding social impact . Several observational study show POCD occur 25 % patient 1 week surgical procedure ( early POCD ) approximately 15 % patient 3 month ( late POCD ) . Importantly , incidence POCD 3 month associate increased disability mortality . Post-operative cognitive dysfunction probably multifactorial syndrome , nevertheless 3 principal pathophysiological hypothesis , certainly could co-exist , formulate : 1 . Pharmacological hypothesis : drug employ anesthesia produce alteration neuronal network , principally alteration cholinergic transduction signal ; 2 . Toxic hypothesis : neuronal damage direct consequence drug employ anesthesia inflammatory mediator associate surgical procedure ; 3 . Hemodynamic hypothesis : hemodynamic change induce general anesthesia cause alteration cerebral blood flow , potentially result ischemic neuronal damage . The present study focus third hypothesis aim evaluate influence target intraoperative arterial blood pressure base preoperative value development POCD 3 month elective non-cardiac surgery general anesthesia patient age 75 year old . The present study potential high scientific socio-economic impact could identify single quite easily accomplish intraoperative intervention , i.e . different management intraoperative blood pressure , could potentially reduce incidence neurological deterioration elderly patient undergo general anesthesia non-cardiac surgery . Furthermore , first study investigate population patient age 75 year , best investigator ' knowledge , first study evaluate systematically possible change hear vestibular function induce general anesthesia surgery . DETAILED RESEARCH PROTOCOL The present study structure 3 distinct phase : 1 . Preoperative Phase ; 2 . Intraoperative Phase ; 3 . Postoperative Phase ; 1 ) PREOPERATIVE PHASE After obtain informed consent study , several evaluation perform Clinic preoperative anesthesiology evaluation . These include standard anesthesia evaluation , geriatric neuropsychological evaluation audiology evaluation . All preoperative evaluation perform day place normal path follow outpatient schedule elective surgery . Geriatric , neuropsychological audiology evaluation always perform sequence . Multidimensional Geriatric Assessment : The multidimensional geriatric assessment include several test allow global evaluation functional status patient , include cognitive domain functional performance ( ability ) . The Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) Clock Drawing Test use assess cognitive state patient . The MMSE usually employ clinical practice two reason : ( ) quick tool screen cognitive status patient ( ii ) tool track change time cognitive state patient . The MMSE consist 30 item ( questions/tests ) , explore different cognitive domain : spatial temporal orientation , memorization word , attention , calculation , recall , language constructive praxis . The score MMSE range therefore 0 30 . A correct score ≤ 23 usually consider suggestive cognitive decline . The score MMSE correct age education patient . The Clock Drawing test ( CDT ) additional test employ evaluate global cognitive state patient consider complementary MMSE . To perform CDT patient ask draw circle order symbolize clock face . Furthermore patient ask draw watch hand order indicate ten past eleven . The test explore visual-spatial , practical executive function patient . The maximal obtainable score 5/5 require presence number , drawn correct order close border clock face , correct symmetry watch hand correctly show ten past eleven . The presence extra number , segmentation line rotation number determine subtraction 1 point score . Scores &gt; 3/5 consider normal . Functional performance evaluate employing score `` Activities Daily Living '' ( ADL ) `` Instrumental Activities Daily Living '' ( IADL ) , respectively . The ADL activity person able perform independently daily basis ( eat , dress , wash , move bed chair , use toilet , etc. ) . The IADL activity allow person live independently house apartment ( cook , clean house , take medication , use phone , etc . ) . Finally patient characterize term frailty . The geriatric concept frailty generically indicate condition increase vulnerability stressful condition , associate increase risk adverse event include fall ground , disability , hospitalization mortality . Physical frailty define presence 3 follow criterion : 1 . Unintentional weight loss ( ≥ 5 % body weight loss last year ) ; 2 . General feeling exhaustion ( subjective , base question effort perform certain activity ) ; 3 . Weakness express reduced handgrip strength , apply different reference value woman men ; 4 . Slow walk speed ; 5 . Low level physical activity ; The presence 1 2 criterion characterize call `` pre-frailty '' , condition sensitive eventual intervention compare frailty ( 3 criterion ) . Finally , patient evaluate `` cognitive frailty '' , combine physical frailty score Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) ( see ) , order identify non-dement patient physical frailty however associate initial cognitive impairment . Patients classify 4 different category : 1 . Healthy elderly subject ( evidence physical frailty CDR = 0 ) ; 2 . Elderly subject physical frailty normal cognitive function ( presence physical frailty CDR =0 ) ; 3 . Elderly subject without physical frailty initial cognitive impairment ( physical frailty CDR = 0.5 ) ; 4 . Elderly subject physical frailty initial cognitive impairment ( presence physical frailty CDR = 0.5 ) ; The condition subject belong group 4 define `` cognitive frailty '' . The Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) complex scale perform quantify severity symptom dementia . It include query cognitive functional domain . The final score range 0 3 , high score indicate severe dementia symptom . A score 0.5 suggestive presence mild symptom . It therefore possible patient correct MMSE ≥ 24 CDR score 0.5 . Of note , patient include study undergo CDR test , different item compose CDR derive perform geriatric neuropsychological test battery ( see ) . Neuropsychological Evaluation The cognitive functionality baseline possible worsening anesthesia/surgery , i.e . development POCD , best evaluate administration neuropsychological test battery . During baseline evaluation neuropsychologist administer patient ( subject Control group ) battery test standardize evaluate specifically different cognitive domain : memory , attention , language , executive function , speed information processing . The obtained raw score correct age , gender education transform , accord Italian calibration standard , standardized score ( Equivalent Scores = ES ) ordinal scale range 0 4 , 0 represent score cut-off , i.e. , pathological score , 1 represent borderline score 2,3 4 characterize normality . The duration administration test battery approximately 35 minute . At 3 month 1 year surgical procedure/general anesthesia ( baseline evaluation Control group ) test battery repeat . In test parallel version , parallel version administer , order reduce learn effect . The difference score test perform 3 month ( 1 year ) baseline , correct mean difference observe Control group timeframe , use order define occurrence POCD . Patients difference ( worsen ) global score 3 month global score baseline great 2 standard deviation expect difference , i.e. , mean difference two evaluation ( baseline 3 month ) observe Control Group , diagnose POCD . Moreover , change raw score different test consider purpose identify possible change specific cognitive domain . The administered neuropsychological test follow : - Trail Making Test : evaluate visual-motor coordination speed task-switching skill assess someone 's ability follow simple number sequence ( Trails A ) complex sequence alternate number letter ( Trails B ) . - Stroop test : evaluates selective attention , executive function , inhibition distraction cognitive flexibility . - Symbol Digit Modalities Test : evaluates sustain attention , element vigilance work memory . - Free Cued Selective Reminding Test : measure anterograde visual verbal memory skill . - Verbal Phonemic Fluency Test : measure capacity access verbal vocabulary consider marker pre-frontal functionality . - Denomination test : evaluate capacity visual access vocabulary . These test score cut-off value allow categorize result normal , i.e. , fall within average result obtain control group healthy subject match age , gender education , pathological , i.e. , average value . Audiology Evaluation The audiology evaluation include follow test : video oculography , pure tone audiometry , disyllabic speech audiometry speech audiometry verbal task motor response . Video oculography analyze function oculomotor system study saccadic eye movement optokinetic system . It allow identify alteration level brainstem , cerebellum structure . Saccadic eye movement rapid , ballistic eye movement , subserve vision redirect visual axis new location , i.e. , direct fovea onto object region interest appear periphery field view . Saccadic eye movement represent majority eye movement control signal saccadic eye movement so-called `` retinal error '' . Collected parameter study saccadic eye movement include : Latency : time take appearance target begin saccade response target ; Peak Velocity : high velocity reach saccade . Saccade velocity profile usually symmetrical least small medium size saccade . In condition size saccade remain reasonably accurate , saccade velocity greatly reduce - so-called slowed saccade ; Precision : relation angular displacement eye displacement reference target ; The `` optokinetic reflex '' cause eye movement response object move periphery head stationary extremely important stabilize image visual input retina provide primary control capacity head stationary . It compose slow phase ( SP ) , direct toward movement panorama , quick phase ( QP ) opposite direction . These movement similar characteristic saccadic eye movement . Collected parameter study optokinetic nystagmus include slow-phase velocity optokinetic nystagmus , dependent upon speed stimulus , gain , express percentage ratio speed slow phase nystagmus speed stimulus , asymmetry , indicate difference gain two side . Pure tone audiometry aim define quantitatively qualitatively possible occurrence hearing loss , entity site lesion . Pure tone audiometry perform aid audiometer headphone . This study perform investigate functionality peripheral auditory system . Finally , disyllabic speech audiometry speech audiometry verbal task motor response perform , use controlateral masking ( cocktail party noise ) . These evaluation investigate comprehension verbal stimulus numerically quantify ability repeat disyllabic word . It also evaluate semantic comprehension phrase ability subject follow simple motor command . These test , take together , evaluate functionality peripheral hearing apparatus cortical integration peripheral signal . Considered parameter comprehension verbal message ( 100 % represent full understanding ) sound intensity level comprehension maximal , express decibel hear level ( dB HL ) . Another parameter study speech audiometry test percent reduction disyllabic word understood sound intensity increase . This phenomenon , reduction understood disyllabic word increase sound intensity , due pathologic distortion cochlear retro cochlear structure ( VIII cranial nerve ) . Anesthesiology Evaluation The anesthesiology evaluation perform standard clinical practice preparation surgical procedure general anesthesia . This evaluation include : physiologic , pathologic drug history collection , clinical examination include peripheral saturation oxygen pulse-oximetry ( SpO2 ) , rest heart rate non-invasive blood pressure measurement automatic sphygmomanometer . Three measurement rest blood pressure perform visit mean value three measurement mean blood pressure represent baseline mean arterial blood pressure patient 2 ) INTRAOPERATIVE PHASE . The day operation patient randomize one two group , Treatment Standard Care ( see ) . Vital function record patient operating room , induction anesthesia , throughout entire duration surgical procedure anesthesia extubation transport post-operative intensive care unit . Parameters record include blood pressure ( either invasive non-invasive , depend clinical need ) , heart rate , peripheral saturation oxygen , end-tidal concentration carbon dioxide , ventilator parameter , drug fluid administer , fluid balance blood loss . Additional measurement perform available : non-invasive cardiac output ( Nexfin/Pulsioflex , Edwards Lifesciences ) , non-invasive cerebral oximetry near-infrared spectroscopy ( INVOS , Covidien ) depth anesthesia bispectral index ( BIS ) measurement ( Bispectral Index Technology , Covidien ) . The anesthesiologist responsible clinical management patient assign two arm . Violations protocol possible whenever anesthesiologist judge clinically necessary . - Standard Care Group : intraoperative hemodynamic management leave discretion anesthesiologist , without indication intraoperative hemodynamic strategy adopt . Of note , baseline mean arterial pressure ( measure preoperative evaluation ) communicate anesthesiologist care . - Treatment Group : group anesthesiologist hemodynamic target maintenance mean arterial blood pressure within 10 % baseline mean arterial blood pressure value . The modality reach target ( quantity type drug , quantity type intravenous fluid , position patient etc . ) leave clinical judgment anaesthesiologist . All intervention record . The intraoperative protocol require acquisition hemodynamic , respiratory , parameter already describe pre-defined interval ( anesthesia induction , start surgery , every 30 minute thereafter , end surgery , extubation/transport post-surgical ICU ) . At end operation blood pressure record entire duration general anesthesia download anesthesia monitor analyze offline dedicate software quantify exactly time spent category ( mild , moderate severe , see ) hypotension hypertension . Any hypotensive hypertensive episode classify mild , moderate severe base bad mean arterial blood pressure record episode , accord follow cut-offs . Mild : mean arterial blood pressure 10-20 % baseline mean arterial pressure ; Moderate : mean arterial blood pressure 20-40 % baseline mean arterial pressure ; Severe : mean arterial blood pressure &lt; &gt; 40 % baseline mean arterial pressure . 3 ) POSTOPERATIVE PHASE . DELIRIUM During first postoperative week patient evaluate , daily basis , delirium occurrence CAM-ICU scale ( Confusion Assessment Method Intensive Care Unit ) . POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS Length stay ICU ( applicable ) , length stay hospital postoperative complication record . Cardiac , respiratory , renal , neurologic hemorrhagic complication assess . Cardiac complication Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) : detection rise and/or fall cardiac biomarker value ( preferably cardiac troponin , cTn ) least one value 99th percentile upper reference limit least one following : - symptom ischemia ; - new presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave ( ST-T ) change new left bundle branch block ( LBBB ) ; - development pathological Q wave ECG ; - image evidence new loss viable myocardium new regional wall motion abnormality ; - identification intracoronary thrombus angiography autopsy . Congestive heart failure : least one follow clinical sign ( i.e . elevate jugular venous pressure , respiratory rales/crackles , crepitation , presence S3 ) least one follow radiographic finding ( i.e . vascular redistribution , interstitial pulmonary edema , frank alveolar pulmonary edema ) . Pulmonary embolism : one following : 1 . A high probability ventilation/perfusion lung scan 2 . An intraluminal filling defect segmental large artery helical CT scan 3 . An intraluminal filling defect pulmonary angiography 4 . A positive diagnostic test deep vein thrombosis ( e.g. , positive compression ultrasound ) , acute cor pulmonale cardiac ultrasound one following : A. non-diagnostic ( i.e. , low intermediate probability ) ventilation/perfusion lung scan B. non-diagnostic ( i.e. , subsegmental defect technically inadequate study ) helical CT scan Cardiac arrest : document presume ventricular fibrillation , sustain ventricular tachycardia , asystole , pulseless electrical activity require cardiopulmonary resuscitation , pharmacological therapy , cardiac defibrillation . Atrial fibrillation : new atrial fibrillation result angina , congestive heart failure , symptomatic hypotension , require treatment rate control drug , antiarrhythmic drug , electrical cardioversion . Neurologic complication Stroke ( ischemic hemorrhagic ) : new focal neurological deficit think vascular origin sign symptom last 24 hour lead death . Renal complication Acute kidney injury define increase serum creatinine equal 1.5 time baseline ( preoperative ) value equal 0.3 mg/dl . Hemorrhagic complication Mild hemorrhage : decrease Hb level &lt; 3 g/dl without hemodynamic impact , without need surgical revision endovascular intervention ; conservative treatment ( transfusion 2-3 red blood cell unit fluid infusion ) ; Severe hemorrhage : decrease Hb level &gt; 3 g/dl hemodynamic impact ( tachycardia , hypotension , oliguria etc ) ; transfusion 3 red blood cell unit ; need surgical revision endovascular treatment . POSTOPERATIVE COGNITIVE EVALUATION Patients At 3 month ± 2 week 1 year ± 2 week surgical intervention , patient undergo geriatric , neuropsychological audiology evaluation describe `` Preoperative Phase '' section . Subjects Control Group Subjects enrol Control group undergo evaluation ( geriatric , neuropsychological audiology ) describe `` Preoperative Phase '' section evaluation 3 month ± 2 week 1 year ± 2 week . These subject undergo surgical procedure therefore evaluate post-operative complication delirium occurrence . STATISTICS Sample size calculation . Primary outcome measure : The incidence POCD around 15 % patient age 70 year . Despite lack data patient age 75 year ( average expect age around 80 year population ) , investigator estimate incidence 20 % . Hypothesizing propose intervention ( intraoperative arterial blood pressure target ) could cause 25 % relative reduction incidence POCD ( 20 % 15 % ) sample size , probability type I error α=0.05 power ( 1-β ) = 0.8 1812 patient . Of note , enrolment 906 patient Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) perform ad interim analysis . Secondary outcome measure : - Delirium : incidence delirium old patient undergo general anesthesia around 15 % . The sample size foreseen primary outcome measure ( 1812 patient ) provide power ( 1-β ) = 0.88 α = 0.05 detect 30 % relative reduction secondary outcome measure . - Incidence POCD 1 year : incidence POCD patient 70 year age , 1 year surgery estimate 16 % . In old , give lack data literature , investigator estimate incidence could around 20 % , therefore similar incidence POCD 3 month surgery . The sample size foreseen primary outcome measure ( 1812 patient ) provide power ( 1-β ) = 0.8 α = 0.05 detect 25 % relative reduction secondary outcome measure . - Hearing vestibular dysfunction : There sufficient data literature estimate incidence secondary outcome measure . It therefore possible estimate statistical power . Design Pilot Study This multicentre international prospective parallel-group double-blind ( patient outcome assessor ) randomize control trial . Currently two Centres involve ( Fondazione IRCCS Ca ' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico , Milan , Italy Universitätsmedizin Göttingen ( UMG ) , Göttingen , Germany ) . Other Hospitals involve enrolment first 100 patient ( Pilot study ) . The first 100 enrolled patient include formal pilot study order evaluate feasibility study estimate real incidence POCD 3 month study population . These patient randomize , minimization criterion apply , similarly patient ( see ) . Of note , patient include final analysis . Randomization Patients randomize day surgical procedure use dedicate software . Considering know risk factor POCD ( advanced age , major surgery low level education ) , minimization criterion apply randomization . Minimization allow randomize new patient enrol study order minimize difference two allocation arm risk factor consider . This mean new patient enters study , patient 's characteristic risk factor consider affect patient 's probability enrol one two allocation arm . The minimization criterion allow reduce unbalance know risk factor allocation arm study . The criteria minimization following : - Age class : 75 ≤ age &lt; 80 ; 80 ≤ age &lt; 85 ; age ≥ 85 - Foreseen duration surgical intervention : &lt; 2 hour ; ≥ 2 hour - Education level ( year scholarity ) : 0-8 year ; 9-13 year ; &gt; 13 year Control Group Two hundred fifty subject enrol Control Group ; 30 subject include pilot study . Considering rule thumb require minimum sample size 120 study reference interval , propose sample size 250 seem definitely adequate . Nevertheless , pilot study allow clear view application parametric method . The sample size control group could therefore resized base preliminary data Pilot Study . Statistical analysis The analysis continuous variable perform via Student 's t-test , one two way analysis variance ( depend characteristic analysis ) . The study association continuous variable perform linear regression method keep consideration possible non-linear effect . The analysis non-categorical variable perform contingency table use Fisher 's exact test Chi-square test , together appropriate indicator association . P &lt; 0.05 consider significant .
