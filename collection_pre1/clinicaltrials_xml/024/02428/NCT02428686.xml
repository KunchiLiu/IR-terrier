	<brief_summary>Chronic anemia symptom frequently find diagnosis low risk myelodysplastic syndrome . It generate increased rate morbidity mortality population patient whose median age high rate co-mobidities important . The historical treatment limited transfusion support significant impact quality life incidence secondary haemosiderosis , contribute emergence co-morbidities , especially cardiovascular . Treatment rHuEPO allow overall erythroid response 40-60 % patient treat . In trial , investigator intend study interest treatment epoetin beta patient anemia &lt; 10 g / dL context myelodysplastic syndrome IPSS score &lt; 1 . In addition study erythroid response , investigator measure impact quality life functional performance . Patients receive epoetin beta ( 60 000UI/week ) . Response assess 12 24 week treatment .</brief_summary>
