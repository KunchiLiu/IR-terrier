	<detailed_description>In study investigator investigate whether bromocriptine influence metabolic activity BAT , assess 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) -CT scan This observational , prospective design invasive measurement . The investigator include 16 healthy lean male volunteer ( age 18-30 year , BMI 19-25 kg/m2 ) The volunteer recruit advertisement local paper internet ( via social medium ) , cover direct surroundings clinic ( Amsterdam ) advertisement medical faculty Academic Medical Center ( AMC ) . The included subject visit AMC hospital 3 occasion . During visit 1 investigator obtain Informed consent oral write information study . The investigator obtain medical history , vital sign laboratory measurement . During visit 2 investigator measure body weight investigator perform energy expenditure measurement 40 minute bed rest . The investigator regularly measure temperature tympanic thermometer . The subject receive intravenous administration radioactive pharmacon 18F-FDG , 60 minute administration 18F-FDG , 18F-FDG PET-CT scan perform . After 18F-FDG PET CT scan , investigator measure insulin sensitivity perform oral glucose tolerance test . After visit , subject start use bromocriptine ( 1,25mg/day first week 2,50mg/day second week ) evening . Visit 3 ( 2 week visit 2 ) exactly visit 2 . In three day visit 2 3 , subject record eat behaviour .</detailed_description>
