	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year . Doseescalation Cohorts : Patients advance solid tumor refractory , relapse intolerant standard therapy , standard therapy exists . Extension Cohorts : Patients history solid tumor activate BRAF mutation 1 . Melanoma : Patients unresectable Stage IIIC Stage IV disease ; Refractory , relapse , intolerant treatment ( ) BRAF BRAF/MEK inhibitor and/or ( b ) FDAapproved immunotherapy 2 . Nonmelanoma solid tumor : 1 . No prior exposure RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor 2 . Patients refractory , relapse intolerant standard therapy , standard therapy exists : ( ) Advanced thyroid carcinoma Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma : Positive ( IHC ) V600E ( know history BRAF mutation ) allow enroll ; Locoregional disease longer amenable curative surgery radiation , advanced disease measurable primary metastatic disease ; Papillary thyroid carcinoma Must beyond 3 week last radioactive iodine treatment AEs associate previous therapy must resolve Grade 1 baseline ; Thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) less upper limit normal ( ULN ) per institutional laboratory range . ( ii ) Other advanced tumor ( eg . colorectal cancer , nonsmall cell lung cancer , cholangiocarcinoma . Measurable disease RECIST 1.1 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . Adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal function . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy Screening must agree use effective form contraception time negative pregnancy test 3 month last dose study drug . Effective form contraception include abstinence , hormonal contraceptive conjunction barrier method , double barrier method . Women nonchildbearing potential may include either surgically sterile postmenopausal ≥ 1 year . Fertile men must agree use effective method birth control study 3 month last dose study drug . Completion previous anticancer therapy ( e.g . chemotherapy , immunotherapy , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , radiation therapy ) least 2 week study drug initiation , resolution associate toxicity ( ≤ Grade 1 Baseline ) prior PLX8394 administration . Willingness ability provide write informed consent prior studyrelated procedure comply study requirement . Symptomatic brain metastasis . Patients untreated brain metastasis ≤ 1 cm consider eligible deem asymptomatic investigator upon consultation Medical Monitor require immediate radiation steroid . Patients brain metastasis treat stable 1 month may consider eligible asymptomatic stable dose ( &gt; 2 week ) steroid require steroid follow successful local therapy . Doseescalation Cohorts : Investigational drug use within 28 day ( 5 halflives , whichever long ) first dose PLX8394 Extension Cohorts : Investigational drug use within 28 day ( 5 halflives , whichever short ) first dose PLX8394 . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy ( exclude skin cancer resection ) , significant traumatic injury within 14 day initiate study drug ( unless wound heal ) , anticipation need major surgery study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness . Active secondary malignancy unless malignancy expect interfere evaluation safety approve Medical Monitor . Examples latter include basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , insitu carcinoma cervix , isolated elevation prostatespecific antigen . Patients completely treat prior malignancy evidence disease ≥ 2 year eligible . Refractory nausea vomiting , malabsorption , external biliary shunt , significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption . Baseline mean QT interval correct use Fridericia 's equation ( QTcF ) ≥ 450 msec ( male ) ≥ 470 msec ( female ) . Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia include bradyarrhythmias and/or patient require antiarrhythmic therapy ( exclude beta blocker digoxin ) . Patients control atrial fibrillation exclude . Congenital long QT syndrome patient take concomitant medication know prolong QT interval ( e.g. , tricyclic , azithromycin , methadome ) . History clinically significant cardiac disease congestive heart failure &gt; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 2 . Patient must unstable angina ( angina symptom rest ) newonset angina within last 3 month myocardial infarction within past 6 month . Women breastfeed pregnant . Known chronic human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection . Imprisonment legal guardianship . The presence medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator , make patient inappropriate study inclusion . Inability swallow retain study drug .</criteria>
