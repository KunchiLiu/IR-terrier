	<brief_summary>The study conduct community-based , randomize , placebo-controlled , trial four study group . The overall objective study determine optimal method deliver zinc young child , prevention zinc deficiency treatment diarrhea . In particular , investigator plan compare impact physical growth , morbidity , micronutrient status , immune function , environmental enteric dysfunction , parasite burden hair cortisol concentration : 1 ) daily preventive zinc supplementation micronutrient powder ( MNP ) ; 2 ) placebo powder ; 3 ) daily preventive zinc supplementation dispersible tablet ; 4 ) therapeutic zinc supplementation dispersible tablet give relation episode diarrhea . In addition major outcome mention , investigator monitor adherence intervention , neuro-behavioral development , occurrence adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lao Zinc Study : Effects Two Forms Daily Preventive Zinc Versus Therapeutic Zinc Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Zinc essential nutrient require child 's normal growth resistance infection , include diarrhea pneumonia , two major cause child mortality . Current strategy control growth infection-related complication zinc deficiency include : 1 ) daily weekly preventive zinc supplementation , 2 ) therapeutic zinc supplementation 10-14 day relation episodes diarrhea . Information need relative impact intervention strategies child 's growth risk new episode diarrhea ( infection ) . Preventive zinc supplement deliver either single nutrient ( zinc ) supplement multiple micronutrient ( MMN ) supplement , micronutrient powder ( MNP ) add young child 's complementary food . Available research indicate zinc deliver MNP currently recommend dose ( 4.1-5 mg/d ) measurable impact zinc-related functional outcome , like growth prevention infection . Moreover , study MMN supplement detect great incidence diarrhea MMN group non-intervention placebo control group . Thus , despite beneficial effect MNP prevention anemia enhance iron status , question raise desirability provide zinc MNP ( contain iron nutrient ) versus single nutrient formulation offer meal . For reason , present study design compare zinc delivery plan ( i.e. , preventive versus therapeutic supplementation ) well form deliver zinc ( i.e. , dispersible tablet give meal MNP give meal ) permit assessment adverse effect MNP incidence diarrhea . The study conduct community-based , randomize , placebo-controlled trial four study group rural community Khammouane Province Central Lao PDR . The project team enroll total ~3,400 child whose age range 6-23 month . Children randomly assign one four study group : 1 ) preventive zinc supplementation provide LI-MNP plus ORS placebo tablet treatment diarrhea ; 2 ) placebo preventive supplementation provide placebo powder plus ORS placebo tablet diarrhea ; 3 ) preventive zinc supplementation provide dispersible zinc tablet ( contain 7 mg zinc , give meal ) plus ORS placebo tablet diarrhea ; 4 ) therapeutic zinc supplementation provide dispersible tablet ( contain 20 mg zinc ) diarrhea plus ORS placebo preventive tablet . The major outcome monitor include adherence intervention ; physical growth ; incidence , duration severity episodes diarrhea ; change MN status ; immune function ; environmental enteric dysfunction ; parasite burden ; hair cortisol concentration ; neuro-behavioral development ; occurrence adverse event .</detailed_description>
