	<detailed_description>This prospective , open label pilot study patient symptoms acute chronic pouchitis receive FMT therapy deliver via pouchoscopy . Number Subjects : This study aim enroll approximately 30 patient pouchitis . Eligibility Criteria FMT Group : Both acute chronic pouchitis eligible treatment FMT . Patients eligible FMT include : 1 . Patients history proctocolectomy Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis ( IPAA ) ( pouchitis confirm endoscopy pathology . 2 . Concurrent therapy mesalamine , immunomodulators , corticosteroid biologic agent allow continue study . All patient pouch Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) evaluate Gastroenterology clinic Colorectal surgery clinic . Patients eligible study identify regularly schedule clinic visit . Patients express interest set meet clinical research coordinator go study detail obtain informed consent . Prior FMT procedure stool sample check ova parasite , C. difficile toxin fecal calprotectin . Serum test include erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Anti-nuclear antibody ( ANA ) , complete blood cell count , HIV , screen Hepatitis A , B , C ( hep A IgM , hep B surface antigen antibody , Hep C antibody ) , creatinine . Eight day treatment , patient take 5 day course rifaximin discontinue 3 day FMT treatment . All patient clinical suspicion pouchitis undergo pouchoscopy . Pouchoscopy ( endoscopic evaluation pouch ) consider part standard care management patient . All participant undergo pouchoscopy consider study procedure . This do endoscopic unit Mt . Zion , Parnassus and/or Mission Bay . During procedure , patient FMT group , fecal transplant take place . For FMT , 250 cc FMT material ( previously screen stool OpenBiome ) administer via endoscope . During FMT procedure 3 pouch biopsy collect . The scope withdrawn patient recover endoscopy unit per protocol . All patient undergone FMT pouchitis call next day ensure adverse event occur . A second FMT treatment follow visit schedule 4 week initial procedure . A pouchoscopy 3 pouch biopsy conduct 6 six month initial FMT treatment check heal . One week second FMT treatment , patient give option enroll 6 week , per week FMT capsule therapy administer 1 hour clinic visit . Patients receive capsule call follow ensure adverse event occur . Study participant ask submit stool sample prior treatment , one month treatment every three month treatment 1 year duration total 6 sample . Additionally , blood serum sample collect baseline 1 6 month FMT procedure . Study participant also administer patient survey assess clinical outcomes/symptoms prior treatment 1 month receive treatment . In addition , patient receive phone call 24 hour , 1 week , 1 month every 3 month 3 year FMT treatment .</detailed_description>
