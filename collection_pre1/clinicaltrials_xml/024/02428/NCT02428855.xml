	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The standard treatment metastatic cholangiocarcinoma combination chemotherapy gemcitabine cisplatin . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve dasatinib specific disease ( Cholangiocarcinoma ) approve us ( Chronic Myeloid Leukemia )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must unresectable metastatic histologically confirm intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma Patients must either IDH1 IDH2 mutation ( know mutation ) base SNaPshot platform molecular test platform either archive tissue fresh biopsy ( test CLIAcertified lab ) Patients biliary tract cancer ( extrahepatic gallbladder cancer ) IDH1 IDH2 mutation allow Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan . See section 10 evaluation measureable disease . Participants must receive least one prior platinumbased regimen advance cholangiocarcinoma progressive disease become intolerable regimen Age ≥18 year . Life expectancy ≥3 month . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( see Appendix A ) . Participants must adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,200/mcL Platelets ≥75,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 5 X institutional upper limit normal PT/PTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 GFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 Serum Albumin ≥2.8 g/dl Prior chemoembolization , radiofrequency ablation , radiation liver allow long patient measurable disease outside treated area measurable progression site treat area Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Sexually active subject ( men woman ) must agree use medically accept barrier method contraception ( eg , male female condom ) course study 4 month last dose study drug ( ) , even oral contraceptive also use . All subject reproductive potential must agree use barrier method second method birth control course study 4 month last dose study drug ( ) . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening . Women childbearing potential include woman experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopause define amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month . Note : woman amenorrheic 12 month still consider childbearing potential amenorrhea possibly due prior chemotherapy , antiestrogens , ovarian suppression reversible reason . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Prior treatment dasatinib Periampullary tumor Chemotherapy , within 4 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin ) recover less equal grade 1 adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . The subject receive radiation therapy : bone brain metastasis within 14 day first dose study treatment site ( ) within 28 day first dose study treatment The subject active brain metastasis epidural disease ( Note : Subjects brain metastases previously treat whole brain radiation radiosurgery subject epidural disease previously treat radiation surgery asymptomatic require steroid treatment least 2 week start study treatment eligible . Neurosurgical resection brain metastasis brain biopsy permit complete least 3 month start study treatment . ( Baseline brain imaging contrastenhanced CT MRI scan subject know brain metastasis require confirm eligibility . ) The subject uncontrolled , significant intercurrent recent illness include , limited , following condition : Cardiovascular disorder include Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) : New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III ( moderate ) Class IV ( severe ) time screen Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension define sustain BP &gt; 140 mm Hg systolic , &gt; 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within 7 day first dose study treatment Diagnosed suspected congenital long QT syndrome Any follow within 6 month first dose study treatment : Unstable angina pectoris Clinicallysignificant cardiac arrhythmia Stroke ( include TIA , ischemic event ) Myocardial infarction Thromboembolic event require therapeutic anticoagulation ( Note : subject venous filter ( e.g . vena cava filter ) eligible study ) Any history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , Torsades de pointes ) Prolonged QTc interval preentry electrocardiogram ( &gt; 450 msec ) , may use either Fridericia Bazett 's correction Hypokalemia hypomagnesemia correct prior dasatinib administration Patients take drug generally accept risk cause Torsades de Pointes . The following must discontinue least 7 day prior start dasatinib eligible : quinidine , procainamide , disopyramide , amiodarone , sotalol , ibutilide , dofetilide , erythromycins , clarithromycin , chlorpromazine , haloperidol , mesoridazine , thioridazine , pimozide , cisapride , bepridil , droperidol , methadone , arsenic , chloroquine , domperidone , halofantrine , levomethadyl , pentamidine , sparfloxacin , lidoflazine Other clinically significant disorder : active infection require systemic treatment within 28 day first dose study treatment serious nonhealing wound/ulcer/bone fracture within 28 day first dose study treatment Patients know moderate/severe pleural effusion unrelated malignancy establish diagnosis pulmonary arterial hypertension Concurrent malignancy ( adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , superficial transitional cell carcinoma bladder , cervical carcinoma situ ) diagnose within past 3 year currently active malignancy Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . The subject receive type investigational agent within 28 day first dose study treatment . The subject unable swallow tablet Individuals know HIVpositive exclude study . Pregnant woman exclude study due potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother dasatinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated dasatinib . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Subjects may receive study agent concurrently study</criteria>
