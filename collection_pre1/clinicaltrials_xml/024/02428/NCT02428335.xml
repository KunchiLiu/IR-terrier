	<detailed_description>Sunitinib , type tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) approve FDA standard care treatment renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Fatigue common side effect sunitinib frequently cause dose reduction . The cause fatigue remain unclear . It show TKIs disrupt growth factor pathways muscle lead muscle shrinkage . If sunitinib associate fatigue due alter muscle physiology molecular level , observable change uptake 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy scan . The study objective determine sunitinib-induced fatigue determine VO2 QOL fatigue relate questionnaire response correlate molecular change muscle evidence 99mTc-sestamibi uptake .</detailed_description>
