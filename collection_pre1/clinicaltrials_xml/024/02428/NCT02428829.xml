	<detailed_description>As part study , patient wait total hip replacement , serious medical problem give information sheet study preoperative education group session approximately 12 week prior surgery . If interested would ask day operation would like take part study , potential participant opportunity ask question senior member research team telephone study specific appointment wish stage .

Their pain level walk first time . 4 . How quickly return independence walk task . 5 . Whether medical complication operation . The null hypothesis rapid walk follow total hip replacement affect amount time patient stay hospital , amount time take reach functional milestone walk stair , patient grade experience physiotherapy . The result research would analyse half way data collection end data collection research team Sponsor would publish part research paper medical journal . This type study design choose provide research team high quality comparison two group . Due nature treatment felt n't possible implement participant clinician blinding methodology .
