	<brief_title>Effect Of Static And Dynamic Stretching On Muscle Tendon Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle stretch common practice apply warm-up process order enhance performance sport prevent decrease risk sport injury . Muscle stretch also use therapeutic purpose many clinical condition . It generally perform either static dynamic manner . Muscle bring lengthen position hold point certain period time static stretching ( SS ) . In dynamic stretching ( DS ) , however , active movement muscle take joint range motion create stretch , muscle hold end position . Although recent study suggest static stretch adverse effect performance , reduce maximal muscle force successful prevent non-contact injury , believe ; dynamic type therefore gaining popularity ; report flexibility range motion improve stretching consequence decrement muscle stiffness . However , effect stretch depend type , duration timing stretch still debate prescription provide best result term flexibility , power , performance injury protection . And happen viscoelastic property muscle stretch statically dynamically still well document . Ultrasound seem good option offer objective non-invasive way expose alteration muscle tendon due stretching .</detailed_description>
