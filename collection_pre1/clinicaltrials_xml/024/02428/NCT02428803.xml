	<detailed_description>Background : Peritoneal Dialysis use 100,000 patient worldwide 7 % patient United States . 1 As much less expensive in-center hemodialysis counterpart provide improved quality life , strategy need increase utilization . One potential barrier peritoneal dialysis geographic barrier care exist geographically diverse large country Canada , India , Australia , United States . 2,3 Access experience home dialysis unit limit many part United States contribute low utilization rate physician discomfort therapy well increase technique failure rate inexperienced center . 4-7 Prakash et al recently show 55 % dialysis unit certify provide home dialysis . 8 In rural network network 8 ( Alabama , Mississippi , Tennessee ) , number drop 38 % thus increase geographic barrier provision home dialysis care . Patients currently live rural area home therapy face long commute time commitment add significant financial hardship patient . Furthermore , commute impact quality life . Telemedicine telemonitoring may provide mean bridge geographic barrier thus improve access home dialysis care improve patient quality life therapy thus increase utilization . The use telemedicine provision home dialysis care receive limited attention worldwide even less United States . Early study use telemedicine remote care suffer high cost implement secure T1 line limit technology.9 Gallar et al Spain publish 2 year experience use alternate videoconferencing visit standard hospitalize visit , show cost saving , ability evaluate patient edema exit site evaluation , well decreased time associate visit . 10 Nakamoto et al . Japan publish tool transmit blood pressure , glucose reading remotely etc . 11 Since initial study conceptualization telemedicine , technology increase fast pace . Videoconferencing technology become much small , sophisticated , easy use , inexpensive make mainstay daily life include application face time skype . Technology literacy well continued increase since early 2000 . A recent survey among peritoneal dialysis patient show 88 % own computer 94 % knew use computer . 12 Furthermore , 83 % patient wished participate telemedicine . 12 It within environment telemedicine application home dialysis may begin transform delivery care home dialysis thus increase peritoneal dialysis utilization improve convenience therapy improve quality life . Such intervention already gain popularity country India . 3 Studies need determine feasibility telemedicine provision home dialysis care United States quality life patient use mechanism improve . Furthermore , study show outcome similar improve use telemedicine need . The long-term goal project improve access peritoneal dialysis care quality live patient dialysis evaluate way eliminate geographic barrier . The objective determine specifically telemedicine capacity . By evaluate establish framework home dialysis care could provide via telemedicine determine impact quality life patient , policy could inform coverage telemedicine substitute current face-to-face requirement Medicare . Furthermore , intervention possibility improve quality life effective possibly increase utilization peritoneal dialysis patient rural urban due increase convenience therapy respect in-center hemodialysis . The central hypothesis implementation telemedicine visit substitute 2 3 monthly face-to-face visit 6 month period improve quality life judge quality life ( QoL ) indices Kidney Disease Quality Life - Short Form Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale compare QoL scale take time period patient standard care . Specific Aims 1 . Determine impact telemedicine quality life indicate two quality life survey : 1 ) The KDQOL- SF Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale . The investigator postulate patient , telemedicine intervention improve quality life score KDQOL-SF form minimum clinically significant change 3 point , compare time period standard care visit ( Not telemedicine ) . 2 . Determine feasibility use telemedicine remote monitoring provision care peritoneal dialysis patient substitute two 3 monthly face-to-face visit 6 month period . Based work Nayak et al . India , investigator feel telemedicine visit substitute face-to-face visit feasible advantageous . 3 . Obtain preliminary data efficacy intervention regard outcomes composite endpoint episode peritonitis hospitalization . The investigator postulate either difference outcomes improvement outcome telemedicine intervention arm . Study Design : Patients recruit University Alabama Birmingham Peritoneal Dialysis Unit . All patient 's address know screened order determine inclusion criterion . Upon enrollment , patient administer KDQOL-SF IIRS . Patient start standard care arm . During time period patient receive 6 month visit per usual standard care . Data collect time regard hospitalization , peritonitis , technique failure , access procedure . Monthly labwork include hemoglobin , phosphorus , parathyroid level , iron , total iron binding capacity , ferritin also collect . At end 6 month KDQOL-SF IIRS administer . The patient transition telemedicine arm study duration 6 month . During time , patient come dialysis unit quarterly basis standard visit lab draw in-center in-center Kt/V . For 2 month follow visit , however , patient require come dialysis unit . The monthly face face labs achieve remotely . In order , investigator partner Alabama Department Public Health . During telemedicine visit , patient present county health department outfit capability provide interactive telemedicine visit . Exam : The patient examine telemedicine encounter use blue-tooth stethoscope , place patient chest personnel county health department . The exit site examine use remote camera . Fluid status monitor lung exam , weight patient routine basis , examination pit edema do telemedicine interface . Labs- On quarterly `` standard '' visit telemedicine intervention , patient give 2 preaddressed prestamped container vial need collect monthly lab . The patient telemedicine visit bring container blood collection tube county health department . There , personnel health department perform phlebotomy , use predetermine blood collection tube . Once fill , tubes sent prestamped container Davita Central Lab processing . In way , additional cost lab incur , lab result standardize one central lab . Flow sheet : Patients record therapy obtain use Baxter ProCard . The patient train card prior go telemedicine arm study . The patient give 2 card . Patients use 1 procard month , prior telemedicine visit send card download . Patients begin use thesecond card , previous card send back patient via mail prior second visit 3rd month . Remote QoL Surveys : Patients administer either phone paper form depend literacy KDQOL-SF IIRS survey Visit 3 , Visit 6 . After completion telemedicine arm , patient return Standard Care 2 month back standard care , KDQOL-SF IIRS administer .</detailed_description>
