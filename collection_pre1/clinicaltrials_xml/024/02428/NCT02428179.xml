	<brief_summary>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) frequent complication patient undergo abdominal surgery . A previous prospective observational study 167 patient undergoing elective open abdominal procedure show case-relevant communication protects organ/space SSI whereas case-irrelevant communication last 20 minute procedure risk factor incisional SSI . Therefore , introduction clinical applicable intervention `` structure brief use StOP protocol '' develop test pilot experiment . This intervention aim improve case-relevant communication procedure reduce excess case-irrelevant communication end operation . The hypothesis : structured briefing operation reduce incidence SSI surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Structured Communication OR Surgical Site Infections : Prospective Observational Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background A number publication show relatively high rate complication relate treatment disease . Such iatrogenic incident important influence patient morbidity increase healthcare cost . Therefore , patient safety minimize risk iatrogenic harm become major concern healthcare . Surgical site infection ( SSI ) one frequent complication patient undergo surgery , lead considerable cost . In previous study , investigator establish empirical relationship communication surgery SSI show prospective observational study 167 patient undergoing major elective open abdominal procedure . An analysis 11383 communication event observe team train work psychologist show relationship intraoperative communication SSI . Adjusted logistic regression analysis reveal case-relevant communication entire procedure associate significant reduction organ/space SSI ( odds ratio 0.861 , 95 % confidence interval 0.750-0.987 ; P=0.034 ) . Interestingly , case-irrelevant communication last 20 minute procedure associate significant increase incisional SSI ( odds ratio 1.1153 , 95 % confidence interval 1.040-1.196 ; P=0.002 ) . Distractors noise traffic also assess effect SSI . The current study base observation , reveal case-relevant communication protects organ/space SSI case-irrelevant communication last 20 minute procedure risk factor SSI . These finding interpret light previous study assess communication surgery similar collaborative task show explicit task-relevant communication foster development share mental model task within team . This facilitate coordination , team member inform state task progress , good anticipate contribution . This particularly important critical phase procedure , well OR team compose member different level knowledge expertise . Explicit task-related communication may particularly useful inform non-sterile team member ( anesthetist , scrub nurse ) full sight operative field time . Although case-irrelevant communication surgical team find foster positive team-climate , see distractor diverts attention away main task . This likely closing phase ( last 20 minute ) , team member , central task already finish , clear clean routine task . If routine task team engages much non-patient relevant communication , attention closure may divert . Given previously find result , introduction clinically applicable intervention ( describe ) test pilot study . This intervention aim assure short discussion case-relevant aspect specific moment procedure , draw attention case-relevant communication main phase prevent high increase case-irrelevant communication end operation . Objective To perform prospective clinical trial test impact structure intraoperative briefing SSI . The incidence SSIs compare introduction intervention . Methods - Intraoperative briefing : First briefing : exposure organ interest , Second briefing : Intraoperative briefing closure operative field . - Trainings Retrainings - Optional Interventions : Transparent drape anesthesia sterile team ; Controlling noise potential distractors wound closure ; Nutritional support operation</detailed_description>
