	<brief_summary>In patient early-stage breast cancer , chemotherapy substantially improve survival rate breast cancer patient . Improvements outcomes , however , compromise considerable toxicity associate chemotherapy , notable neutropenia . Neutropenia presence abnormally white blood cell , lead increase susceptibility infection require hospitalization need intravenous antibiotic sometimes fatal . Febrile neutropenia also associate treatment delay dose reduction , potentially compromise treatment efficacy . Patients receive medication reduce risk febrile neutropenia , Neupogen ( Filgrastim ) daily injection 5 , 7 , 10 day . Since genuine uncertainty amongst healthcare professional administration schedule Neupogen better , investigator perform randomize study patient put group chance give participant one three standard Neupogen daily injection . Neupogen cost approximately $ 200 per injection , physician prescribes 10 day 8 cycle treatment cost $ 16,000 compare 5 day prescription would cost half . In addition cost saving , many patient able give injection daily basis require nursing resource utilized high-cost . This study use `` integrated consent model '' involve `` oral consent '' rather write informed consent process order increase number patient may participate perform study low cost . While determine optimal treatment improve patient comfort acceptability , use minimal safe duration administration may also offer cost saving .</brief_summary>
