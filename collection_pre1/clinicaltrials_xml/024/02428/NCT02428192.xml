	<brief_title>Nivolumab Treating Patients With Advanced Uterine Leiomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 patient advanced leiomyosarcoma uterus ( ULMS ) treat nivolumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity nivolumab patient advanced ULMS . II . To evaluate progression-free survival ULMS treat nivolumab . III . To explore relationship program death-ligand 1 ( PDL1 ) , program death ( PD ) 1 infiltrate lymphocyte PD2 status archival tumor , pre/post treatment biopsy minimum 10 patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore relationship general immune response specific marker immunomodulation response nivolumab . II . To explore relationship tumor inflammatory gene signature response nivolumab archival material . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) approximately 60 minute every 2 week 46 dos absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 100 day .</detailed_description>
