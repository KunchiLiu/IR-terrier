	<brief_summary>This research do see study drug call amyl nitrite helpful diagnose different disorder affect low esophageal sphincter patient dysphagia ( difficulty swallow food ) undergo high resolution esophageal manometry ( HRM ) . Dysphagia may one symptoms condition know idiopathic achalasia . Achalasia disorder esophagus , tube carry food mouth stomach . This affect ability esophagus move food toward stomach . Pseudoachalasia secondary form achalasia , similar symptom cause different reason . Because treatment achalasia pseudoachalasia different , important correctly diagnose condition . At time , way distinguish two current test use Johns Hopkins . Amyl nitrite relaxes vascular smooth muscle study previously potential mean separate achalasia pseudoachalasia . Amyl nitrite approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment cardiac angina . It approve use motility test use study consider investigational . Investigators hope result propose study could significant clinical implication patient management help doctor distinguish achalasia pseudoachalasia allow choose appropriate treatment . Patients dysphagia ( difficulty swallow food ) undergo routinely schedule high resolution esophageal manometry ( HRM ) may join study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Assess Diagnostic Utility Amyl Nitrite Patients With Suspected Achalasia Undergoing High Resolution Esophageal Manometry ( HREM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single center , prospective study tertiary-care referral center ( JHH ) . All patient provide informed consent undergo HRM provocation part routine care evaluate dysphagia symptom evaluation know achalasia . All procedure perform part routine care therefore procedure perform purpose research specifically . Primary Objective : To determine diagnostic advantage addition provocative amyl nitrite test patient dysphagia undergoing high resolution esophageal manometry ( HRM ) Secondary Objective : 1 . Measure change LES pressure amyl nitrite inhalation patient dysphagia undergoing high resolution esophageal manometry ( HRM ) 2 . To assess ability amyl nitrite inhalation differentiate achalasia pseudoachalasia 3 . To assess ability amyl nitrite inhalation differentiate partial fundoplication-related dysphagia versus due recrudescence achalasia patient undergone prior myotomy . 4 . To assess ability amyl nitrite inhalation differentiate post-fundoplication dysphagia newly diagnose motility disorder patient undergone fundoplication gastroesophageal reflux disease .</detailed_description>
