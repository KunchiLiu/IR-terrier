	<brief_summary>The investigator want : 1 . Assess whether curative radiotherapy lung cancer lead permanently reduce lung function 2 . To assess predictive value pulmonary function test development permanent reduction lung function curative radiotherapy 3 . To assess predictive value genetic marker permanently reduce lung function curative radiotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Function Changes After Curative Targeted Radiotherapy Non-small-cell Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective control study plan include 70 patient lung cancer control group change lung function , 50 COPD patient take blood sample study group . It include lung cancer patient stag IA-IIIA destine stereotactic conventional radiotherapy chemotherapy curative intent . Lung function test The following lung function measure study . This examinations do routinely patient COPD indicate degree respiratory depression patient . 1 . Vital capacity , FVC : Forced vital capacity - The total amount air liter person manages blow first draw breath much possible . 2 . FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume first second ) : Forced expiratory volume first second - Number liter air blow first second , test subject blow hard . 3 . TLCO ( gas diffusion capacity CO ) : Determination amount oxygen reach diffuse alveoli blood . 4 . Static lung volume TLC ( total lung capacity ) maximum lung volume maximal inspiration . Measured use body plethysmography . 5 . Static lung volume RV ( residual volume ) volume air remain lung maximal expiration . Measured use body plethysmography . Other parameter measure effect side effect radiation therapy . Patients receive radiation therapy follow clinically ( patient general condition ) radiological study , examine state illness treatment effect . Patients follow radiology ( X-ray CT thorax ) , measurement O2 saturation ( SaO2 rest ) , measurements partial oxygen carbon dioxide pressure ( blood gas ) 6 min . walk test ( measure many foot patient able walk within 6 min. , tire , oxygen saturation ) . Moreover , use questionnaire breathlessness grade accord MMRC ( Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Score 's ) . It consist 10 question concern `` last 7 day '' . Abratt et al . found 1995 worsen dyspnea score patient lose 10 % diffusion capacity . Part project take blood sample . Specific blood sample analyze identify biomarkers could predict development radiation-induced lung change . One imagine development severe radiation fibrosis , also certain identifiable marker detectable blood sample .</detailed_description>
