	<brief_title>Study Comparing Blood Levels Fatty Acids After Consuming Two Forms Cod Liver Oil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many dietary lipid form triglyceride , ethyl ester phospholipid . During digestion lipid subject hydrolysis , particular pancreatic triglyceride lipase . To facilitate action enzyme , lipid emulsify action bile salt . By increase surface area fat globule , emulsification increase access lipid pancreatic triglyceride lipase . This study design compare iAUC0-24h plasma level n-3 fatty acid ( sum total free EPA DHA ) ingestion emulsify product non-emulsified reference control free flow cod liver oil low appropriate dose practically acceptable , near possible test product ' recommend daily dose .</detailed_description>
