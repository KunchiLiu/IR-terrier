	<brief_summary>Background : - PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum ( PROS ) cause change PIK3CA gene . This gene make protein communicates protein body cause cell grow . Alterations PIK3CA change chemical signal body cause overgrowth fatty , vascular tissue . Sirolimus drug reduces signal send one proteins chemical signal pathway . Researchers want learn whether drug sirolimus reduce stabilize overgrowth patient PROS experience . Objectives : - To measure overgrowth patient PROS change time whether take drug call sirolimus reduce stabilize person overgrowth . Eligibility : - People age 3 65 year old confirm mutation alteration PIK3CA gene person affect tissue ( somatic mutation ) . Design : - Participants screen medical history genetic counseling . - First 6 month : Participants overgrowth monitor . - Next 6 month : Participants take sirolimus twice day . - Participants visit clinic several time , stay area 4 5 day time . - Participants one month-long visit clinic . - During clinic visit , participant : - Blood urine test . - Photographs physical feature . - Scans , include MRI DEXA , possibly x-rays CT scan . - For MRI CT scan , participant lie machine take picture body . - The DEXA involve small amount radiation . - They may : - Non-invasive heart function test . - Lung function test . - Participants several blood urine test visit . - Participants complete survey keep diary treatment side effect . - Participants may visit health specialist undergo test base side effect . - One month stop study drug , participant 1 clinic visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Sirolimus Therapy Segmental Overgrowth Caused Somatic PI3K Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary study objective determine likely size sirolimus treatment effect . The patient population include male female subject , age great equal 3 year less equla 65 year age segmental overgrowth identify clinical molecular finding somatic PIK3CA gene mutation . The plan study size ten patient see NIHCC . An additional 20 patient contribute two center , responsible conduct propose research site , study procedure dose schedule identical enable pool result statistical analysis . The study design nonrandomized , open label , phase II pilot study sirolimus treatment . As patient highly variable clinical presentation , establish evidence-based methodology measure serial change growth , aim pilot study establish optimal methodology evaluate change growth inform design future randomize control trial , addition determine treatment effect size , evaluate safety toxicity low dose sirolimus . Overall desire outcome reduce size affect body part , measure include : reduction affect tissue ( fibroadipose bone ) size clinical exam measurement radiological study ( MRI area measurement and/or DXA study measurement fat ) .</detailed_description>
