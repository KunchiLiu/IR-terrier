	<brief_summary>Hypothesis / aim study Urinary retention uncommon young woman , one cause primary disorder urethral sphincter relaxation , characterise elevated urethral pressure profile specific finding urethral sphincter EMG ( Fowler 's Syndrome ) . Women may present symptom obstruct void complete urinary retention . Clean intermittent self-catheterisation often painful perform currently , treatment show benefit sacral neuromodulation . This aim pilot study assess efficacy urethral sphincter injection botulinum toxin , define improvement flow rate 50 % , improvement residual volume score IPSS questionnaire , safety , woman Fowler 's Syndrome . Study design , material method In open label pilot institutional review board approve study , ten woman primary disorder urethral sphincter relaxation ( elevated urethral pressure profile ( UPP ) , sphincter volume abnormal EMG ) present obstruct voiding ( n=5 ) complete urinary retention ( n=5 ) recruit single tertiary referral centre . Baseline symptom assess use IPSS questionnaire , urinary flow post-void residual volume measure . After 2 % lidocaine injection , 100U onabotulinumtoxintypeA inject striated urethral sphincter , divide either side , EMG guidance . Patients review week 1 , 4 10 post-treatment symptom reassess use IPSS questionnaire , urinary flow post-void residual volume measure . The UPP repeat week 4 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin A Injections Patients With Fowler 's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Full Title : Open label pilot study treat woman chronic urinary retention void dysfunction due primary disorder sphincter relaxation ( Fowler 's syndrome ) outpatient urethral injection botulinum toxin A ( BoNT-A ) . Short Title : Botulinum toxin A injection patient Fowler 's Syndrome Rationale : The department Uro-Neurology National Hospital Neurology Neurosurgery attract approximately 300 new female patient urinary retention refer UK year . A retrospective study show common diagnosis primary abnormality striate urethral sphincter Fowler 's syndrome . Fowler 's syndrome ( FS ) due intrinsic muscle disorder cause muscle state constant contraction recognize needle electromyography ( EMG ) striate muscle . In original description EMG abnormality frequently observe woman clinical feature polycystic ovary , lead hypothesis electromyographic abnormality consequence hormonal abnormality , since know female urinary sphincter hormonally dependent . The ongoing abnormal EMG activity think lead sustain involuntary contraction sphincter secondary effect inhibit detrusor contraction . A diagnosis FS make find characteristic abnormal activity EMG recording finding abnormally raise urethral pressure profile enlargement striate urethral sphincter muscle ultrasound show additional valuable investigation . The treatment find far restore void sacral neuromodulation . This expensive , resource intensive surgical intervention , subject high revision rate ( 53 % ) . An alternative management option would welcome patient healthcare professional . Sphincter injection botulinum toxin A ( BoNT-A ) first use treat detrusor sphincter dyssynergia follow spinal injury inappropriately time qualitatively normal EMG activity occur sphincter detrusor contraction . However recent publication report restoration detrusor function sphincter injection botulinum toxin A woman non-neurological condition , although insufficient detail give paper know patient FS . Although , Fowler use sphincter botulinum toxin injection 15 year ago attempt treat condition conclude intervention effective . This possibly much low dose use compare recently report successful study , 100 U Botox速 use . Objectives : The aim small scale , open label pilot study obtain data response woman definite diagnosis FS injection 100 U Botox速 ( BoNT-A ) striate urethral sphincter . If evidence positive response data form basis future large scale , placebo control , grant fund study . Method : 5 woman complete urinary retention due abnormality sphincter relaxation demonstrate characteristic FS 5 woman sphincter abnormality obstruct void fully study document severity extent sphincter-bladder dysfunction . Pre-treatment assessment include standard investigation appropriate woman complete urinary retention obstruct void show characteristically abnormal FS . These urine flow rate ( void ) , cystometry , urethral pressure profile , sphincter volume . The definitive diagnosis rest find sphincter EMG test uncomfortable possible combine necessary EMG record injection Botox速 patient consent enter study . The injection treatment outpatient procedure ( estimate take less 15 minute ) : follow 1ml 1 % 2 % lignocaine inject either side urethral orifice , 100 U Botox速 dissolve 2mls saline inject , 1ml side striate urethral sphincter EMG control . The effect BoNT-A inject striated muscle know onset within 3-4 day duration action 6 week . The patient therefore follow 1 , 4 , 10 week follow treatment flowmetry ultrasound residual volume IPSS questionnaire . The pre intervention investigation cystometry , urine flow rate ( void ) residual volume measure ultrasound , urethral pressure profile repeat 4 week . Sphincter EMG repeat patient show highly significant response i.e . restoration detrusor contraction woman previously complete urinary retention elimination post void residual volume woman obstruct void . Outcome measure Primary - Improvement urinary flow rate ( assessed uroflowmetry measure mL/sec ) 50 % botulinum toxin compare baseline woman obstruct void - Restoration voiding ( either yes ) botulinum toxin woman complete urinary retention Secondary - Improvement post void residual urine ( assessed bladder scan measure mL ) compare baseline botulinum toxin . A reduction less 100mls would consider clinically significant . - Improvement low urinary tract symptom assess improvement score IPSS ( International Prostate Symptom score ) questionnaire</detailed_description>
