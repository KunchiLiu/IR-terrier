	<brief_title>Social ABCs Toddlers With Signs Autism Spectrum Disorder : Trial Parent-Mediated Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With funding Autism Speaks ( 2007-10 ) , investigator develop conduct pilot evaluation autism-specific intervention toddler ASD . The Social ABCs , develop investigator , innovative parent-mediated intervention toddler confirm suspected ASD . The Social ABCs draw know core , early emerge impairment ASD , evidence-based Pivotal Response Treatment ( PRT ) associate parent training program enhance development child ASD , literature effective parent training program risk infant . The investigator also draw demonstrated success implement province-wide PRT-based early intervention program preschooler ASD , develop effective brief train PRT parent newly diagnose child ASD . The Social ABCs intervention incorporate principle procedure Applied Behaviour Analysis ( ABA ) , represent natural language paradigm PRT , supplement Responsive Parenting . Targets intervention focus two area early impairment ASD - functional spoken language positive parent-child emotion share . Data collect parent child . Measures key target child behaviour ( i.e. , vocal responsivity initiation ) share positive emotion cod videos child-parent play interaction record family home 3 separate day 3 time point : ( 1 ) study entry ( Baseline/ pre-Training ) , ( 2 ) Post-Training ( Week 12 ) ( 3 ) Follow-up ( Week 24 ) . For time point , data cod videos child-parent interaction average across 2 day increase probability representative key child target parent variable study ( i.e. , represent either particularly `` good '' `` bad '' day ) . To provide strong test generalization child learning , measure functional behaviour cod videos child-examiner play interaction record family home 2 separate day Follow-up ; examiner blind treatment group , train PRT , unfamiliar child . Standardized child measure collect study entry Week 24 . These include Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule , Autism Observation Scale Infants , Mullen Scales Early Learning - AGS Edition , Preschool Language Scale-4 , Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales , 2nd ed . Child parent questionnaire also complete time point . For Treatment group Control group , Service Log complete record service intervention child currently participate . This Service Log update throughout duration family 's participation trial . A child family 's data consider `` useable '' long child enrol study include week 4 . If child family drop study reason prior completion week 4 , consider data useable . The 6-month Social ABCs parent-mediated intervention consist 3 month in-home live parent coach 3-month period parent implement strategy coach . Parents implement procedure vivo , play follow routine daily life toddler . Research Trainers train parent use positive teaching procedure feedback suggestion focus parent ' strength ( i.e. , correct close-to-correct implementation intervention procedure ) . The 3-month parent train program consist 8 consecutive week `` Active Training '' follow 4 consecutive week `` Consultation Refresher '' . During 8-week `` Active Training '' phase , individual 1.5-hour session provide three time separate day Week 1 , twice separate day Week 2 Weeks 3-8 , total 11 training session . Parents provide write module form Social ABC 's Intervention Manual , lead Research Trainer . Each visit begin discussion module intervention target . For remainder session , parent implement procedure child , receive feedback ( vivo coach ) Trainer . During 4-week `` Consultation Refresher '' phase ( Weeks 9-12 ) , parent contact weekly Trainer via telephone/ email trouble-shoot specific issue need , Trainer make 2 home visit ( Weeks 10 12 ) additional video recording vivo coach take . For control group , treatment typically provide local service ( e.g. , visit community early interventionist/speech language pathologist ; see Eligibility Criteria ) . Upon completion Week 24 , control group offer intervention receive experimental group . Primary Aims Hypotheses : ( 1 ) It predict , relative control , toddler Social ABC 's ( experimental ) treatment group show great post-training follow-up change functional speech ( i.e. , responsivity initiation ) positive emotion share caregiver . Secondary Aim : It predict ( 1 ) parent treatment group achieve fidelity implementation , ( 2 ) experimental group also show great gain control group standardized measure receptive expressive language . Exploratory Aims : Investigators predict ( 1 ) post-training follow-up child gain share positive emotion relate high level parental ( facial ) positive emotion , ( 2 ) post-training follow-up child gain functional vocalization ) moderate well receptive language baseline , b ) relate , experimental group , parent ' fidelity PRT implementation post-training .</detailed_description>
