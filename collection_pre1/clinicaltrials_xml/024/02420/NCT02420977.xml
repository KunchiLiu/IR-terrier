	<brief_summary>This research do see investigational radioactive imaging agent ( radiotracer ) call 18F-DCFPyL help u find prostate cancer original site prostate gland distant site ( bone , lymph node ) men diagnose prostate cancer surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation PSMA-based PET Imaging Biomarker Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose evaluate feasibility use novel small molecule PET radiotracer , DCFPyL target prostate cancer prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) . PSMA well study cell surface marker prostate cancer increase expression associate high tumor grade advanced metastatic tumor . More specifically associate high Gleason score evidence serve potential marker prostate tumor carcinogenesis , progression AR signal surrogate marker ADT response . This small molecule PET radiotracer specifically target important prostate specific marker AR signal dynamic follow ADT , tumor progression metastatic potential warrant validation in-vivo non-invasive imaging biomarker PSMA expression prostate cancer detection .</detailed_description>
