	<detailed_description>1 . Background Infections soil-transmitted helminthes ( STH ) occur throughout develop world remain major public health problem poorest community . Infection cause four main specie worm commonly know roundworm ( Ascaris lumbricoides ) , whipworms ( Trichuris trichiura ) hookworm ( Ancylostoma duodenale Necator americanus ) ( Bethony et al. , 2006 ) . It estimate STH affect 2 billion people worldwide , 450 million significant morbidity attributable infection , hence one important neglect tropical disease . Children pregnant woman two vulnerable group . Children experience growth stunt diminish physical fitness well impaired memory cognition , result impaired childhood educational performance reduce school attendance ; pregnant woman suffer significant morbidity hookworm-associated anemia likely contribute maternal mortality ( Bundy et al. , 1992 ; Stoltzfus et al. , 1996 ; Crompton Neisheim , 2002 ; WHO 2005 ; Bethony et al. , 2006 ) . Preventive chemotherapy ( PC ) program single-dose albendazole 400 mg single-dose mebendazole 500 mg - drug choice STH - administer population level , main strategy STH control . To ensure quality , drug widely donate GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) ( albendazole ( ALB ) , Zentel ) Johnson &amp; Johnson ( mebendazole ( MEB ) , Vermox ) . In addition , wide variety ALB MEB tablets available local market . Although little known quality anthelmintic sell human use , several publication report variability quality generic anthelmintic use veterinary medicine . The concentration nine anthelmintic product ( levamisol MEB ) purchase pharmacy agricultural merchant Kenya vary 0 118 % claim composition ( Monteiro et al. , 1998 ) . Efficacy study seven brand ALB gastrointestinal nematode sheep Ethiopia show efficacy five seven brand satisfactory ( Kumsa et al. , 2010 ) . 2 . Objectives The main objective present study compare efficacy two ALB brand buy local market , include OVIS ( Korea , DAEHWA pharmaceutical ) BENDEX ( India , Cipla ) 3 . Materials methods 3.1 . Study Population School child 4 18 year old focus study two main reason : school child normally major target regular treatment anthelminthic , group usually heavy worm burden A. lumbricoides T. trichiura , steadily acquire hookworm infection . In addition , period intense physical intellectual growth ( Bundy et al. , 1992 ; Crompton Nesheim , 2002 ) . Deworming schoolchildren considerable benefit nutritional status ( Stoltzfus et al. , 1996 , Curtale et al. , 1995 ) , physical fitness , appetite , growth ( Stephenson et al. , 1993 ) intellectual development ( Nokes et al. , 1994 ) . 3.2 . Study design The study design base recent WHO guideline assess drug efficacy STH . Briefly , follow obtain informed consent , school child target age range group recruit ask provide recent stool sample ( interval less 4 hour ) process determine fecal egg count ( FEC ) STH present . For initial sample aim enroll least 650 child . This base sample size least 50 infected subject STH treatment arm ( cfr WHO guideline ) , apparent prevalence 20 % least prevalent STH specie drop 20 % . All child provide stool sample randomize across two treatment arm . Fourteen day treatment second fecal sample collect child determine FEC . Subjects unable provide stool sample follow-up , experience severe concurrent medical condition diarrhea time first sampling , exclude study . At follow-up student receive single oral dose ALB tablet donate GSK WHO ( Zentel ) . 3.3 . Determination FEC STH All fecal sample process use McMaster egg counting technique ( analytic sensitivity 50 EPG ) detection enumeration infection A. lumbricoides , T. trichiura hookworm . 3.4 . Statistical analysis The efficacy brand three STH measure reduction FEC use formula . The efficacy drug classify 'satisfactory ' , 'doubtful ' 'reduced ' use criterion summarize Table 1 . Table 1 . The criterion base FECR classify efficacy drug 'satisfactory ' , 'doubtful ' 'reduced ' A. lumbricoides T. trichiura Hookworm Satisfactory FECR ≥ 95 % FECR ≥ 50 % FECR ≥ 90 % Doubtful 95 % &gt; FECR ≥95 % 50 % &gt; FECR ≥40 % 90 % &gt; FECR ≥80 % Reduced FECR ≤85 % FECR ≤40 % FECR ≤80 % 3.5 . Interpretation In case doubtful reduce efficacy step take assess efficacy drug . 4 . Ethical issue This study review Ethics committee Faculty Medicine , Ghent University ( Belgium ) Jimma University , Jimma ( Ethiopia ) . 5 . Starting date It expect start 1st February 2014</detailed_description>
