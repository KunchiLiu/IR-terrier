	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize patient gastroparesis , gastric empty improve celiac plexus block . By improve gastric emptying , symptom related gastroparesis include nausea , vomit , bloating , abdominal pain , weight loss , also improve . In order study hypothesis , investigator enroll patient gastroparesis non-responsive current treatment available . Patients fill questionnaire ass severity symptom undergo Ansar test ( non-invasive test ) measure autonomic function respectively . Then , patient undergo celiac plexus block perform via upper endoscopy . One week procedure , patient ask undergo gastric emptying study well repeat Ansar test evaluate improvement gastric empty autonomic function respectively . Patient ask repeat questionnaire , one , two , three , eight week procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Celiac Plexus Block Gastric Emptying Symptoms Caused Gastroparesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator identify patient gastroparesis due idiopathic cause ( include post-viral ) diabetes undergone 4 hour gastric empty study show delay gastric emptying . Patients enrol must clinical symptom due gastroparesis include nausea , vomit , abdominal pain , early satiety , bloating , reflux , postprandial fullness weight loss . Patients include study may refractory treatment ineligible current standard care metoclopramide , domperidone , macrolide antibiotic , pyloric injection botulinum toxin . Patients agree enroll study sign inform consent explain study purpose along risk procedure involve study . One team member also explain study patient either phone person answer question may regard study . Patients enrol study fill questionnaire comprise gastroparesis cardinal symptom index daily diary ( GCSI-DD ) visual analog scale ( VAS ) ass severity nausea , vomit , abdominal pain , bloating . Then , patient undergo autonomic function measurement use Ansar system non-invasive measurement autonomic system use blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate monitoring . Ansar test take approximately 15 minute . Subsequently , patient undergo celiac plexus block , perform endoscopically EUS- guidance Ann Chen . Injections perform use 0.75 % bupivicaine 40mg/ml triamcinolone , ideally 1ml directly celiac ganglion . If ganglia identifiable , injection perform celiac space , locate take celiac artery aorta . One week block , gastric empty study Ansar testing perform . The GCSI-DD/VAS questionnaire repeat 1 week , 2 week , 3 week , 2 month procedure .</detailed_description>
