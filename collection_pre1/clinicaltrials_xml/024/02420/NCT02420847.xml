	<brief_title>A Two-Dimensional Dose-Finding Study Ixazomib Combination With Gemcitabine Doxorubicin , Followed Phase II Extension Assess Efficacy This Combination Metastatic , Surgically Unresectable Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 6 group 4 participant enrol Phase 1 study , 33 participant enrol Phase 2 . If enrolled Phase 1 , combination dose ixazomib , gemcitabine , doxorubicin receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low combination dose level . Each new group receive high dose drug combination group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose drug combination find . If enrolled Phase 2 , receive drug combination high dose tolerate Phase 1 . Study Drug Administration : On Day 1 every 14-day cycle , take ixazomib 1 time mouth , receive gemcitabine vein 90 minute , receive doxorubicin vein 15-30 minute . Gemcitabine doxorubicin may give catheter . A catheter sterile flexible tube place large vein anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form . You chew , break , open capsule ixazomib . If capsule break , careful spread dust cleaning . The product may harmful breathe , swallow , touch . Gloves protective clothing worn cleanup return broken capsule powder minimize skin contact . The area ventilate site wash soap water material pick-up complete . The material dispose hazardous medical waste compliance federal , state , local regulation . In case contact powder ( broken capsule ) , skin wash right away soap large amount water least 15 minute . In case contact eye , large amount water use flush eye least 15 minute . Call study staff right away happen . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Every 3 cycle start Cycle 4 ( Cycles 4 , 7 , 10 , ) , also x-ray CT scan MRIs check status disease . On Day 8 Cycles 1 2 , blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If disease get bad , either ECHO MUGA scan check heart function , doctor think need . At time doctor think need , bone scan check status disease . Length Treatment : You may continue receive study drug long doctor think best interest . You may longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Ixazomib FDA approve commercially available treatment urothelial cancer . Gemcitabine doxorubicin FDA approve commercially available several type cancer . Their use combination ixazomib urothelial cancer investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 57 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
