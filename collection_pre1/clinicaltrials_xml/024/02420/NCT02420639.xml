	<brief_summary>The aim prospective , interventional study assess feasibility safety Esophageal Cooling Device patient suffer traumatic brain injury treat physician treating target temperature management . Comparison outcomes make historical control . The primary outcome feasibility inducing , maintain , rewarming patient target temperature management use Esophageal Cooling Device ( cool rate , rewarming rate , percent time within goal temperature goal-temperature maintenance period ) . Evaluation adverse event ( include cardiac arrhythmia , severe bradycardia , myocardial infarction/re-infarction , dysphagia , odynophagia , aspiration pneumonia , non-aspiration pneumonia , reflux , esophageal injury , esophagitis ) closely monitored whole period target temperature management ( secondary endpoint ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective , Interventional Study Evaluating Feasibility Safety Esophageal Cooling Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Controlling patient 's body temperature , particular , reduce body temperature treatment refer targeted temperature management , show improve outcomes many condition , include neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy , cardiac arrest , traumatic brain injury . However , available modality induce targeted temperature management number technical , logistical , financial barrier . The Esophageal Cooling Device multi-chambered silicone tube place esophagus provide highly efficient heat transfer patient . Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) major cause death severe disability throughout world . Current method traumatic brain injury treatment include reduction brain swell edema , surgical mean , well reduction temperature avoidance fever . Methods use reduce temperature control fever include surface device , ice pack water circulate blanket , intravascular catheter , place blood vessel . The esophagus close proximity blood flow heart great vessel , Esophageal Cooling Device ( ECD ) design take advantage heat exchange environment . The ECD 's ability decompress stomach avoid distention esophagus away device ensures good contact esophageal mucosa , thus maximize heat transfer patient . The ECD replaces standard gastric tube place target patient population routine standard care , make standard medical-grade silicone , generally similar size shape gastric tube currently use . Initial mathematical , animal , human data show strong support efficacy safety ECD . The aim prospective , interventional study assess feasibility safety Esophageal Cooling Device patient suffer traumatic brain injury treat physician treating target temperature management . Comparison outcomes make historical control . The primary outcome feasibility inducing , maintain , rewarming patient target temperature management use Esophageal Cooling Device ( cool rate , rewarming rate , percent time within goal temperature goal-temperature maintenance period ) . Evaluation adverse event ( include cardiac arrhythmia , severe bradycardia , myocardial infarction/re-infarction , dysphagia , odynophagia , aspiration pneumonia , non-aspiration pneumonia , reflux , esophageal injury , esophagitis ) closely monitored whole period target temperature management ( secondary endpoint ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient population consist 15 patient suffer traumatic brain injury , treat clinician determine targeted temperature management initiate . Patients know esophageal deformity evidence esophageal trauma ( example , know esophageal varix , cirrhosis , history esophagectomy , previous swallow disorder , achalasia , etc. ) . Patients know ingestion acidic caustic poison within prior 24 hour . Patients less 40 kg body mass . Patients know pregnant . Terminal disease `` resuscitate order '' could lead earlyonset therapeutic withdrawal . Unstable hemodynamic condition could lead multiorgan failure earlyonset death . Preexisting severe conductive disorder require pacing .</criteria>
