	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Open Label Trial Assess Safety Efficacy OptiVein IV Catheter Oncologic Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OptiVein IV Catheter sterile single use disposable intravascular cannulation device modify CE certify Vasofix Certo Catheter B.Braun additional feature optical fiber modify flashplug . The OptiVein System also include electronic unit . The study control predicate device Vasofix Certo IV Catheter B. Braun Medical Inc . This device base device OptiVein IV Catheter add optical fiber electronic unit . The OptiVein Catheter share similar intend use catheter component Vasofix Certo IV Catheter . Clinical data obtain assess change safety efficacy profile due laser component OptiVein IV Catheter . Subject population consist Oncologic patient either difficult access vein experience unsuccessful IV start previous visit hospital , require short-term use IV catheter administer chemotherapy medication intravenously . Subjects may enrol multiple time , patient-visit unit analysis . Primary efficacy endpoint successful IV insertion first attempt , define placement catheter inside vein allow fluid drug delivery blood withdrawal . 167 167 patient-visits include OptiVein Vasofix Certo respectively ( 1:1 randomization ) , result total sample size 334 visit . This sample size provide 80 % power demonstrate superiority OptiVein Catheter Vasifix Certo Catheter . Secondary endpoint include : 1 . Total number attempt require successful IV insertion . 2 . Time successful IV insertion , define time first skin puncture placement catheter inside vein allow fluid drug delivery blood withdrawal 3 . Incidence blood extravasation result hematoma 4 . Incidence fluid extravasation deliver catheter 5 . Incidence infection ( phlebitis , dermatitis induration ) insertion site 72 hour time catheter removal , whichever occur first . 6 . Unplanned withdrawal IV catheter 7 . Overall complication rate compose # 3-6</detailed_description>
