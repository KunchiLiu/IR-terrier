	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well bendamustine hydrochloride , obinutuzumab , dexamethasone work treat old patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , obinutuzumab , may find cancer cell help kill . Giving bendamustine hydrochloride , obinutuzumab , dexamethasone may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine , Obinutuzumab , Dexamethasone Older Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess overall response rate ( ORR ; complete responder [ CR ] + partial responder [ PR ] ) use Cheson et al parameter novel combination regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess feasibility incorporate prospective geriatric assessment patient &gt; = 70 year age diagnose diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) treat multi-center setting . II . Quality life ( QOL ) base Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Lung ( FACT-L ) scale enrol patient . III . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) 2 3 year . IV . Overall survival ( OS ) 2 3 year . OUTLINE : Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 2 , obinutuzumab IV 4 hour day 1 2 , 8 , 15 ( day 1 2 course 1 ) , dexamethasone orally ( PO ) daily day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 40 month .</detailed_description>
