	<brief_title>Effect Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine Motor Function Quality Life Cervical Dystonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical dystonia , also call spasmodic torticollis , type neurological disorder characterize spastic muscle neck largely underdiagnosed despite progression disability midlife . Cervical dystonia occur least 0.390 % United States population 2007 ( 390 per 100,000 ) . Symptoms commonly include stiffness , pain , headache , difficulty swallowing , fatigue , difficulty walking . The current standard treatment intramuscular botulinum toxin injection every 90 day . The effect botulinum toxin increase gradually , decrease little effect 90 day post-injection . The purpose propose research determine Osteopathic manipulative medicine ( OMM ) use combination standard treatment botulinum toxin intramuscular injection improve motor function quality life amongst people cervical dystonia . The investigator propose use Vicon 3-dimensional gait posture analysis determine biomechanics subject primary cervical dystonia compare full body complaint standard spasmodic torticollis/cervical dystonia questionnaire well osteopathic structural exam . These measure assess four OMM treatment . In addition , investigator propose use osteopathic manual medicine along botulinum toxin injection improve subject ' pain motor function evaluate Vicon 3-dimensional gait posture analysis questionnaire regard quality life . Preliminary case report suggest Osteopathic manipulative medicine without botulinum toxin injection improve pain , posture , gait , quality life four adult subject well improve head tilt two child ( two- five-years old ) . The central hypothesis osteopathic manual medicine significantly improve range motion , motor function , quality life subject primary cervical dystonia . Aims : Aim I . To determine 3-Dimensional gait posture biomechanics subject untreated primary cervical dystonia walking , investigate effectiveness OMM treat abnormal biomechanics subject . Hypothesis I : People cervical dystonia similar abnormality posture structural exam significantly alters gait full body motor function significantly improve OMM . Experimental approach : Motor function assess Vicon 3-Dimensional analysis use 34 subject walk depict stride length arm swing side body well posture shoulder pelvic girdle reference coronal , transverse , sagittal plane . Quality life assess Cervical Dystonia Impact Profile ( CDIP ) -58 questionaire . Four weekly OMM diagnosis treatment do , , motor function quality life reassess . Total participation study expect last 5-7 week . Expected outcome : The spasticity neck affect motor function whole body . There decreased stride length arm swing side body neck muscle spasm . The shoulder girdle pelvis continuously rotate around vertical axis direction head reference foot direction walking . The shoulder pelvic girdle tilt closer together one side side due side-bending torso . We also expect indirect relationship age motor function . OMM expect significantly improve motor function quality life . Significance : The impact neck muscle spasticity full body biomechanics subject primary cervical dystonia well understood , result use improve assessment function well management disorder . Aim II . To determine whether osteopathic manual medicine use first four week follow botulinum toxin intramuscular injection significantly improve joint range motion , motor function , quality life subject primary cervical dystonia . Hypothesis II : Osteopathic manual medicine improve range motion neck , symmetry posture gait , quality life subject primary cervical dystonia . Experimental approach : Subjects treat botulinum toxin injection evaluate standard spasmodic torticollis form ( filled physician ) , cervical dystonia questionnaire regard quality life , Vicon 3-Dimensional gait posture analysis four weekly treatment OMM ( n≥8 ) comparison subject no-OMM control condition ( n≥ 8 ) . Expected outcome : Subjects improve quality life regard head neck symptom , pain discomfort , upper limb activity , walk , sleep , annoyance , mood , psychosocial functioning . Subjects improve joint range motion motor function . Significance : Although physician specialize osteopathic manual medicine treat patient various type dystonia , effectiveness osteopathic manual medicine treat primary cervical dystonia establish , thus , osteopathic manual medicine recognize recommend adjunctive therapy . The botulinum toxin inject spastic neck muscle . However , adjunctive procedure recommend treat rest symptom associate illness . 3-dimensional characterization motor function use child cerebral palsy generalize dystonia surgical intervention , use similar method may demonstrate OMM prevent people become disabled .</detailed_description>
