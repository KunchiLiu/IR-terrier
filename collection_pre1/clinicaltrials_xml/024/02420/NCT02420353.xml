	<brief_summary>Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) tear among frequent traumatic knee injury occur physically active individual . Despite advance minimally invasive surgical reconstruction technique aggressive rehabilitation , atrophy loss strength persist even patient return full activity place considerable risk re-injury develop osteoarthritis ( OA ) . The design new therapeutic intervention prevent muscle atrophy need advance care patient suffer ACL injury . The growth hormone ( GH ) /insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) axis play important role promote muscle growth protect muscle atrophy . While GH therapy show promise protect immobilized muscle various model disuse atrophy , remain unknown whether GH help restore strength protect loss strength occur ACL tear . GH therapy may help accelerate safe return play patient suffer ACL tear , help prevent long-term OA reduction quality life occur traumatic knee injury .</brief_summary>
