	<brief_summary>The author measure passive tidal volume generate external chest compression order determine whether chest compression alone without mechanical ventilatory support cardiopulmonary resuscitation provide adequate ventilation . The author study 25 volunteer meet follow inclusion criterion : age 18-55 year , ASA I-II , candidate surgical operation , receive general anesthesia . Patients operate chest , present musculoskeletal disease , cardiopulmonary vascular acute chronic disease , history pneumothorax , thromboembolism , osteoporosis , menopause , history current rib sternal clavicle fracture , exclude . All eligible patient enter study receive general anesthesia intubation accord treat doctor ' decision . Patients ventilate mechanically 5 minute establish stable condition . A pneumotachograph connect ventilatory circuit respiratory effort ( volume , airway pressure flow ) continuously monitor real time . An esophageal catheter insert monitor esophageal pressure provide data lung mechanic calculation . Following procedure surgical procedure , chest compression perform patient senior anesthesiologist accord ERC guideline 2010 30 second . Following chest compression , patient evaluate possible complication establishment stable condition surgical procedure follow . After end surgical operation clinical chest ultrasound evaluation perform . Written inform consent obtain patient procedure .</brief_summary>
