	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination elotuzumab revlimid ( also call lenalidomide ) help prevent MM come back patient autologous stem cell transplant . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Elotuzumab With Lenalidomide Maintenance After Autologous Stem Cell Transplant ( ASCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , start receive study drug recover stem cell transplant . Each study cycle 28 day . You receive elotuzumab vein 2-4 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 21 first 2 cycle , Day 1 cycle . You also take lenalidomide capsule mouth Days 1-28 . If study doctor think need , dose lenalidomide may increase 3 month . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon possible day . If missed entire day , take another dose make . If take 1 dose lenalidomide 24 hour , get emergency medical care contact study staff right away . You keep diary record drug take . You ask bring diary , unused drug , empty drug container clinic visit . Before dose elotuzumab , give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle ( +/- 7 day ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status disease . - You complete questionnaire asks symptom may . This take 5-10 minute complete . - Every 1 3 cycle , urine collect 24 hour check status disease . The study staff give container instruction collect urine . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw pregnancy test . On Day 1 ( +/- 7 day ) every 1-3 cycle , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon time ) drawn mandatory research test . On Day 1 cycle Day 15 Cycles 3-6 , blood ( 12 teaspoon total ) drawn immune system test . If study doctor increase dose lenalidomide , Days 8 15 cycle dose increase : -Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If time study doctor think disease come back , bone marrow biopsy/aspirate check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test check status disease . - Urine collect 24 hour check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone survey check status disease . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw pregnancy test . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA-approved commercially available treatment MM myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Its use autologous stem cell transplant investigational . Elotuzumab FDA-approved commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 100 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
