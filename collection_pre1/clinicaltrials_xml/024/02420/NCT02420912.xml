	<brief_title>Nivolumab With Ibrutinib Relapsed , Refractory High-Risk Untreated Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 study group , depend already take ibrutinib . If NOT already take ibrutinib , assign Group 1 . If already take ibrutinib , assign Group 2 . All participant receive nivolumab vein 1 hour Days 1 15 Cycles 1-24 . If Group 1 , start Cycle 2 , also begin take ibrutinib mouth 1 time day time , 2 hour eat 30 minute next meal . You take dose ibrutinib cup ( 8 ounce ) water . Do open capsule dissolve water . If Group 2 , continue take dose ibrutinib currently take . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam , include neurological exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need , may blood draw perform often . - During Cycles 2-4 , urine collect routine test . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycles 1-6 : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - On Day 15 Cycle 1 , urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , physical exam , include neurological exam . After Cycle 1 , physical exam Day 15 . If Group 1 , Day 28 Cycle 1 : - You bone marrow aspiration check status disease . - You CT PET scan check status disease . On Day 28 Cycle 3 every 3 cycle first year ( Cycles 6 , 9 , 12 , ) every 6 cycle : - You bone marrow aspiration check status disease . - If doctor think need , CT PET scan check status disease . On Day 1 Cycles 7 beyond : - You physical exam , include neurological exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check status disease . - Every 3 cycle ( Cycles 7 , 10 , 13 , ) , urine collect routine test . Every 6 week , become pregnant , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . At time doctor think need , may blood draw , CT/PET scan , and/or bone marrow aspiration/biopsies check status disease , study . Length Study : You may receive 24 cycle nivolumab . You continue take ibrutinib long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam , include neurological exam . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate check status disease . - If doctor think need , CT PET scan check status disease . Long-Term Follow-Up : About 1 month end-of-study visit , continue follow-up visit 1 year . - You physical exam 1 time month . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test 1 time month . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn antibody test 1 time every 3 month . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate check status disease every 3-6 month . - If doctor think need , CT PET scan check status disease every 3-6 month . If start new type anti-CLL/SLL treatment follow-up period , stop study visit . This investigational study . Nivolumab FDA approve commercially available use melanoma patient . Its use study investigational . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment patient CLL/SLL . The use drug combination consider investigational . The study doctor explain drug design work . Up 72 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
