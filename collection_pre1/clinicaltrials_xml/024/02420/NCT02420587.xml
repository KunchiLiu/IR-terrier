Participant fast ( anything except water ) 2 hour 1 hour take AMG208 capsule . Participant ask keep diary help keep track take dose study drug . Participant record miss vomited dos diary . If participant vomit dose , re-take dose . Participant wait next schedule dose . Participant bring diary visit . Every 6 week consider cycle . Participant return unused study drug and/or empty pill bottle end cycle . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 ( +/ - 3 day ) : - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . - Participant bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease biomarker test . To collect bone marrow aspirate/biopsy , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate participant 's reaction study drug . On Day 22 Cycle 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Participant EKG . Participant 2 EKGs study doctor think need . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . This blood also use check participant 's PSA level , measure CTCs , biomarker test . - Participant fill questionnaire pain . On Day 1 Cycles 2 every 6 week : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . This blood also use check participant 's PSA testosterone level . - Participant fill questionnaire pain . On Day 1 Cycles 2 3 , every 12 week : - Participant bone scan CT MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis , area study doctor think need check status disease . - Participant EKG . Participant 2 EKGs study doctor think need . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw check participant 's thyroid function , CTC biomarker test . - Participant either ECHO MUGA scan . ( Cycles 2 5 every 12 week ) On Day 1 Cycle 2 participant bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease . On Day 22 Cycle 2 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . This blood also use check participant 's PSA level . - Participant fill questionnaire pain . On Day 1 Cycle 5 , participant bone marrow aspiration check status disease . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : If do within last week , within 5 day participant 's last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . This blood also use check participant 's PSA level , thyroid function , biomarker testing , measure CTCs . - Participant bone scan CT MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis , area study doctor think need check status disease . - Participant bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease . - Participant fill questionnaire pain . Follow-Up Visit : About 30 day participant stop take study drug , follow procedure perform : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . This blood also use check participant 's PSA level . This investigational study . AMG208 FDA approve commercially available . It use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . 2 . Presence metastatic disease bone . 3 . Patients must castrate level testosterone ( &lt; /= 50 ng/dL ) screen visit , medical surgically induce . For patient medically castrate , gonadotropin release hormone antagonist analog must continue maintain testicular suppression . 4 . Evidence progressive disease prior enrolment base AT LEAST one follow criterion : ) Rising PSA : PSA progression define minimum two rise PSA level interval &gt; /= 1 week determination . The PSA value Screening visit &gt; /= 2 ng/mL ; b ) Nonmeasurable ( evaluable ) disease : 2 ( two ) new metastatic bone lesion radionuclide bone scan plain bone film ( xrays ) ; c ) Measurable disease ( RECIST 1.1 ) transaxial imaging : patient must show evidence new progressive disease CT MRI scan . 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . 6 . For patient receive combined androgen blockade ( GnRH antagonist , analog orchiectomy combination continuous antiandrogen include enzalutamide ) , disease progression must determine antiandrogen discontinuation define : ) For patient receive flutamide : least one PSA value must obtain 4 week flutamide discontinuation . ; b ) For patient receive bicalutamide nilutamide : least one PSA value must obtain 6 week antiandrogen discontinuation . ; However , patient respond combine androgen blockade show decline PSA 3 month less antiandrogen administer secondline later intervention , withdrawal response expect therefore disease progression determine provide least one rise PSA value obtain 2 week antiandrogen discontinuation . 7 . Patients receive hormonal therapy , include megestrol acetate , finasteride , ketoconazole , abiraterone , enzalutamide , diethylstilbestrol systemic corticosteroid , must discontinue agent least 2 week prior enrollment .
