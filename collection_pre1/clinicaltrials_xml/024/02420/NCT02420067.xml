	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate best screen Endolymphatic sac tumor ( ELSTs ) von Hippel-Lindau ( vHL ) patient order diagnose ELSTs still small hearing loss prevent . Up 16 % vHL patient know develop endolymphatic sac tumor inner ear cause permanent hearing loss . However , ELSTs often find hearing loss already occur . The challenge doctor diagnose ELSTs early stage cause often irreversible deafness . In order find ELSTs cause hear loss , important screen tumor prophylactically , screen vHL patient regardless whether symptom . Who join ? Persons diagnose vHL least 15 year old . The investigator include patient WITH OR WITHOUT diagnose ELST . What involve ? You need hear test MRI brain , inner ear see , vHL patient already do part surveillance program . Participants ask participate follow examination ( hear test and/or MRI brain ) 2 , 5 , 10 year . How I join ? A doctor responsible study country vHL patient participates . Ask doctor manage vHL examination contact u contact u investigator help find doctor country participate study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Endolymphatic Sac Tumours ( ELSTs ) Von Hippel-Lindau ( vHL ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : von Hippel-Lindau disease ( vHL ) hereditary multi-system disease require life-long prophylactic surveillance . Affected individual predispose development tumor cysts multiple organ . In recent year , become apparent endolymphatic sac tumor ( ELSTs ) , aggressive tumor petrous bone , occur 16 % vHL patient . ELST lead severe progressive hearing loss vertigo well audio-vestibular neurological symptom . However , surgical excision tumor preserve patient ' pre-operative hearing level , eliminate audio-vestibular symptom . As even small ELSTs show lead sudden irreversible deafness , timely diagnosis ELSTs essential prevent severe audio-vestibular morbidity ELST patient . Several recommendation ELST surveillance vHL patient propose ; suggest diagnostic test ELST do vHL patient subjective audio-vestibular symptom , others recommend audiological examination MRI inner ear vHL patient screen tool . However , previously much focus specification screen strategy , know , optimal approach . The result national study ELST surveillance among Danish vHL patient indicate specific pattern audiologic parameter patient ELSTs , indicate distinct audiologic pattern may typical ELST development , perhaps even ELST detectable MRI . However , large study audiologic parameter vHL patient without diagnosed ELSTs need order fully investigate model use early ELST detection . Objective The overall objective study establish audiologic characteristic among vHL patient without ELST , investigate whether specific pattern audiometric parameter correspond different stage ELST development . Material Methods : The study multi-center prospective cohort study include adult vHL patient , follow clinical interview subjective audio-vestibular symptom , MRI inner ear , audiometry . Results subject ' audiological radiologic examination collect Department Cellular Molecular Medicine , University Copenhagen . Results blind regard ELST history radiologic result evaluate single senior ear-nose-and-throat specialist , look specific pattern audiologic parameter time . Radiologic image blind regard symptom audiological examination result evaluate single radiology specialist , look inner ear surround structure presence imaging-visible ELSTs evaluate size pattern growth ELSTs possible . Audiometric characteristic correlate presence MRI visible ELSTs patient ' subjectively report audio-vestibular symptom determine whether specific pattern audiological parameter distinct ELSTs stage tumor growth . A followed-up study participant plan 2 , 5 10 year patient ' last assessed audiological examination include initial study . The initiator project responsible evaluation analysis data , require inform local project manager difference evaluation examination compare local evaluation examination . Local project manager require inform local participant result examination . If ELSTs find participant , local project manager must offer management ELSTs accord local recommendation . The initiator project offer help counsel relation ELST management treatment necessary . Considerations biomedical research ethic : The Danish part study approve Danish Regional Committees Biomedical Research , also approve result participate institution outside Denmark collect analyzed Denmark . Each participate institution outside Denmark must make sure study also approve accord regional law . Oral write consent must obtain subject , result must cod data sent Denmark analysis . Data management : The investigator approval study Danish Data Protection Agency . All data analysis take place University Copenhagen Denmark . Significance perspective : The present study clarify significance audiologic examination ELST surveillance improve ELST screen vHL patient . Publication : The result publish international , scientific journal . Collaborators include ad co-authors publication result study accord Vancouver rule . Funding : The project financially support subproject large PhD project . Salary PhD student , Marie Louise MÃ¸lgaard Binderup finance Danish Cancer Society approximately181,000 Euros , expense operation PhD project support Lundbeck Foundation approximately 65,000 Euros , approximately 4,000 Euros estimate use expense present subproject . The support organisation solely provide financial support influence study design , execution study , publication result . Initiators project apply financial support subproject . Collaborating institution participate patient receive financial support mention source .</detailed_description>
