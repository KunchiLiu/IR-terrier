	<brief_summary>This clinical research study do two part . The goal first part find high tolerable dose ONC201 give patient relapse refractory MCL , DLBCL , TLCL . Groups subject receive increase dos ONC201 mouth day 1 21 day cycle Day 1 every week side effect tolerate maximum 625 mg find tolerable . As result new information , decide subject Arm A continue receive dose every 3 week . All subject dose weekly . The dose receive may low effect high cause bad side effect . In second part study high dose NC201 give learn ONC201 help control disease . Please note first time ONC201 give human subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take assign dose ONC201 capsule mouth Day 1 every 21-day cycle Day 1 every week . You take study drug clinic Cycle 1 . You take ONC201 time day food consume either 2 hour 2 hour take . ONC201 take glass water quickly possible . The capsule swallow whole . Do attempt open capsule dissolve water . Your study doctor give instruction take study drug . If miss dose , take 6 hour time would take . If later 6 hour , skip dose . If vomit dose see capsule take , retake dose . If vomit see capsule , retake dose . You need fill diary card information take ONC201 . You bring diary card every visit . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical neurological exam . - You EKG 15 minute , 1 hour , 2 hour take study drug . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test take study drug , 30 minute , 2 hour , 4 hour , 6 hour take . PK test measure level study drug blood different time point . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test take study drug . PD test measure level study drug body may affect disease . On Day 2 Cycle 1 : - You EKG . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw PK PD test . On Day 3 Cycle 1 , blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw PK PD test . On Day 8 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn routine , PK , PD test . - You EKG . On Day 15 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical neurological exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine , PK , PD test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy aspiration check status disease . - If study doctor think need , GI endoscopy . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1Â½ tablespoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycles 3 , 5 , every odd cycle , CT scan PET/CT scan check status disease . On Days 8 15 Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If study doctor think disease completely respond study treatment , follow test procedure perform confirm status disease : - You colonoscopy , include biopsy abnormal growth . To collect biopsy , small amount tissue remove cut tool . - You bone marrow biopsy . - If doctor think need , PET scan . The test may repeat time doctor think need . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete long-term follow-up phone call .</detailed_description>
