	<brief_summary>Objectives : ( 1 ) To investigate effect Qigong train upper limb oedema , circulatory status , shoulder flexibility muscular strength , body balance , quality life ( QOL ) community-dwelling breast cancer survivor ; ( 2 ) explore relationship impairment outcome QOL outcomes . Hypothesis : ( 1 ) The experimental participant less impairment good QOL Qigong training compare no-training control group ; ( 2 ) impairment parameter related QOL index Qigong participant . Design subject : This prospective , randomised , single-blinded control trial . Approximately 60 breast cancer survivor randomly assign either Qigong training group ( n~30 ) control group ( n~30 ) . Intervention : Participants Qigong group receive 18 Forms Tai Chi Internal Qigong train 3 month two supervise 1-hour session per week . Main outcome measure : The primary outcome measure upper limb circumference , arterial blood flow velocity resistance index , shoulder joint passive range motion , muscular strength ( peak force ) body balance . The secondary outcome measure quality life measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Breast scale . Data analysis : Data analyse via repeated-measures analysis variance follow post-hoc test ( Î± = 0.05 ) . Expected result : The investigator pilot study produce encouraging result efficacy Qigong exercise reduce chronic breast cancer-related symptom survivor . Therefore , investigator expect participant Qigong group few upper limb impairment well quality life Qigong training . If result positive , Qigong training regime readily transferrable clinical practice , could positive socioeconomic effect reduce healthcare cost .</brief_summary>
