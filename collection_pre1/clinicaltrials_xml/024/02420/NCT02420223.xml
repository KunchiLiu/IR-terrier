	<brief_title>Pilot Study Using Propranolol Decrease Gene Expression Stress-Mediated Beta-Adrenergic Pathways Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize control pilot study design evaluate whether drug design block physiologic effect stress effective block stress-related gene expression people receive autologous stem cell transplant ( cell ) multiple myeloma . Such stress-related gene expression one way body program make specific protein condition stress . These protein believe contribute bad health outcome . By use drug propranolol , aim see whether might block negative health effect stress occur cancer set transplant process . We hypothesize individual take propranolol favorable gene expression . We enroll 40 individual , randomize half receive propranolol half serve control group study drug . Study participant start propranolol three week prior transplant continue 30 day transplant . We explore effect socioeconomic status , depression , anxiety individual ' gene expression response propranolol idea impoverish , anxious , depressed individual display even great change gene expression . Part purpose study also assess whether feasible give drug individual cancer . Results study may inform large trial assess effect propranolol cancer progression .</detailed_description>
