	<brief_summary>Intravenous iron therapy common effective , side effect . Two formulation use , venofer iron sucrose ferrlecit , ferric gluconate . The association intravenous iron use decrease serum phosphorus vitamin D level , increase fractional excretion phosphorus , observe old iron preparation , saccharated ferric oxide . However , hypophosphatemia osteomalacia report iron carboxymaltose , new iron formulation . There information literature phosphorus vitamin D level treatment venofer ferrlecit . We intend check phosphorus vitamin D serum level patient prior treatment iron formulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Intravenous Iron Therapy Decrease Serum Phosphorous Levels ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous iron replacement become quite common case oral iron therapy insufficient poorly tolerate . Various intravenous iron preparation use patient dialysis chronic kidney disease many year , however , patient severely reduce glomerular filtration rate generally hyperphosphatemic . Although generally safe , certain iron preparation associate severe phosphorus calcitriol deficiency , cause elevation serum level fgf23 , phosphaturic humoral factor derive osteocyte . Fractional excretion phosphorus indeed raise patient . In case phosphorus deficiency , high fgf23 level , severe osteomalacia result . This phenomenon observe saccharated ferric oxide , preparation commonly use Japan , iron polymaltose . It also observe iron carboxymaltose , new iron preparation , available Israel . These report propose iron cause elevate fgf23 level , turn decrease phosphorus absorption inhibit 1Î±-hydroxylase activity . Patients deficient vitamin D great tendency develop hypophosphatemia . This phenomenon phosphorus deficiency document commonly use preparation iron sucrose ( venofer ) ferric gluconate ( ferrlecit ) . These non-dextran iron preparation low rate allergic reaction adverse event . They use various case iron deficiency anemia normal renal function , patient Inflammatory bowel disease , diabetic people tolerate oral iron therapy . Moreover , certain oral iron preparation investigation present role phosphorus binder . The purpose study measure phosphorus , parathyroid hormone vitamin D level patient prior intravenous iron therapy patient iron deficiency anemia normal reduce Glomerular Filtration Rate . We hypothesize iron therapy ferric gluconate iron sucrose induce hypophosphatemia low level 1,25 hydroxide Vit D. We try ascertain whether hypophosphatemia clinically significant merely low laboratory value , whether patient vitamin 25 hydroxide -D deficiency great propensity develop .</detailed_description>
