	<brief_title>LEE011 Neuroendocrine Tumors Foregut Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . If find eligible take part study , take LEE011 capsule mouth 1 time Days 1-21 cycle . You take LEE011 capsule whole , time morning , without food , least 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . Do chew open capsule unless member study staff tell . If forget take dose , still take study drug 6 hour later . If 6 hour late , wait next schedule dose . If vomit take dose , take extra dose . Tell study doctor nurse vomit take LEE011 . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If take drug prevent blood clot , blood draw also use check well blood clot . On Day 15 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You EKG dose LEE011 . On Day 1 Cycle 2 : - You physical exam . - You EKG dose LEE011 . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If take drug prevent blood clot , blood draw also use check well blood clot . - You image-guided tumor biopsy PD testing . On Day 15 Cycle 2 Day 1 Cycle 3 , EKG 4 hour dose LEE011 . On Day 1 Cycles 3 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If take drug prevent blood clot , blood draw also use check well blood clot . On Day 1 Cycle 2 , Day 1 Cycle 4 , every 3 cycle ( Cycles 7 , 10 , 13 , ) , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw tumor marker test . If study doctor think need , may blood draw perform frequently . The study doctor discus . Every 3 cycle ( Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , ) , MRI , CT , and/or Octreoscan check status disease . On Day 1 Cycles 4-6 , EKG dose LEE011 . Every 4 cycle ( Cycles 4 , 8 , 12 , ) , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check much fat cholesterol blood . You fast least 8 hour blood draw . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study end-of-treatment visit , unless side effect . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 28 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - You EKG either ECHO MUGA scan . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test , include test check much fat cholesterol blood . You fast least 8 hour blood draw . If take drug prevent blood clot , blood draw also use check well blood clot . If side effect symptom , either call member study staff ask come clinic side effect symptoms go become stable . If call , call last 10 minute . This investigational study . LEE011 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 20 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Patients must adequate organ function , define follow parameter : . Bone marrow : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) great equal 1.5 x 10^9/L ; Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) great equal 9 g/dL ; Platelets great equal 100 x 10^9/L . b. Hepatic function : Serum total bilirubin less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 x ULN , except patient tumor involvement liver must AST ALT le equal 5 x ULN . 9 .

Renal function : Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 x ULN 24hour clearance great equal 50 mL/min ; Serum potassium , sodium , magnesium , phosphorus , total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) must within clinically relevant limit ( e.g. , patient enrol lab value may outside normal laboratory range abnormality clinically relevant replete . ) 10 . Negative pregnancy test ( serum BHCG ) within 7 day start study treatment require woman childbearing potential . BHCG may secrete small percentage NETs tumor marker . Thus , NET patient positive BHCG eligible pregnancy exclude vaginal ultrasound lack expect double BHCG . 1 . Patient known hypersensitivity LEE011 excipients . 2 . Patients know suspected brain metastasis . However , radiation therapy and/or surgery complete serial evaluation CT ( contrast enhancement ) MRI minimum 3 month demonstrate disease stable patient remain asymptomatic , patient may enrol . Such patient must need treatment steroid antiepileptic medication . 3 .
