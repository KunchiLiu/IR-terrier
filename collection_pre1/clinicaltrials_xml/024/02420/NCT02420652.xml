	<brief_title>Metformin Hydrochloride Aspirin Treating Patients With Hormone-Dependent Prostate Cancer That Has Progressed After Surgery Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect metformin ( metformin hydrochloride ) aspirin change prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) progression men rise PSA definitive therapy localize prostate cancer stable disease run-in period study regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility safety administer metformin aspirin . II . To determine effect metformin aspirin PSA level serum obesity-related prostate cancer ( PCa ) biomarkers ( insulin , insulin-like growth factor [ IGF ] -1 , interleukin [ IL ] -1beta , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor [ TNF ] -alpha ) . OUTLINE : RUN-IN STAGE : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) aspirin PO daily ( QD ) 4 month . Patients disease progression ( PSA increase &gt; 50 % minimum 2ng/ml rise PSA ) come study . Patients achieve disease response ( &gt; 25 % decline PSA ) continue receive study agent absence disease progression unacceptable disease . Patients stable disease continue randomize study regimen . RANDOMIZATION STAGE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride PO BID aspirin PO QD 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride placebo PO BID aspirin placebo PO QD 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12-16 week 1 year .</detailed_description>
