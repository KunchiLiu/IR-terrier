	<brief_title>Imaging Dementia—Evidence Amyloid Scanning ( IDEAS ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IDEAS Study observational , open-label , longitudinal cohort study design assess impact amyloid PET patient-oriented outcome Medicare beneficiary mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) dementia uncertain etiology . The study fall Centers Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ( CMS ) Coverage Evidence Development ( CED ) policy . A total 18,488 Medicare beneficiary meet Appropriate Use Criteria ( AUC ) amyloid PET enrol 24 month site throughout United States . Dementia specialist team PET facility able perform amyloid PET train radiologists/nuclear medicine physician , consent complete data requirement timeline study . Amyloid PET perform interpret facility result provide order physician support clinical decision making , capture study . Our over-arching hypothesis , diagnostically uncertain case , knowledge amyloid status determine amyloid PET lead significant change patient management , translate improve long-term outcome . We pursue two specific aim : Aim 1 investigates impact amyloid PET short-term patient management , compare pre-PET intend management ( ascertained case report form [ CRF ] prior PET ) post-PET actual management 90-days post-PET ) . The primary objective test whether amyloid PET lead ≥ 30 % change intend actual patient management within 90 day cumulative endpoint consisting : Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) drug therapy , drug therapy , counsel safety future planning . Secondary objective assess impact amyloid PET result clinical diagnosis prevention unnecessary diagnostic procedure treatment . Aim 2 utilizes Medicare claim data compare medical outcome 12 month patient enrol longitudinal cohort ( amyloid PET-known ) match control cohort patient never undergo amyloid PET imaging ( amyloid PET-naïve ) . The primary objective determine amyloid PET amyloid PET-known cohort patient associate ≥ 10 % reduction hospitalization emergency room visit comparison match amyloid PET-naïve patient . Secondary objective examine whether knowledge amyloid PET status reduces hospitalization related ambulatory-sensitive condition , whether association amyloid PET knowledge health outcome varies baseline cognitive status ( MCI versus dementia ) amyloid status ( amyloid positive versus negative ) . The amyloid PET-naïve cohort identify via match algorithm individual amyloid PET-known cohort match one individual similar dementia diagnosis , pre-scan dementia-related resource utilization , age , race , gender , ethnicity , geographic location , comorbid chronic condition likely impact cognition outcomes interest see time amyloid PET-known patient ( concurrent control ) . In pursue Aims , generate valuable observational data clinical utility inform future use technology diagnostic algorithm , develop cohort patient undergo amyloid PET serve foundation address future research question .</detailed_description>
