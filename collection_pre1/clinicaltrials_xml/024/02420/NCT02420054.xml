	<brief_title>Short Term Intermittent Fasting Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 250.000 patient diagnose type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) Denmark , world-wide close 350 million people suffer diabetes . T2DM develop genetically susceptible individual result excess energy intake insufficient amount daily physical activity . The pathophysiology encompass mismatch insulin secretory capacity insulin sensitivity , predominantly manifest skeletal muscle insulin resistance . T2DM associate increased morbidity mortality . The disease trigger individual lifestyle , thereby potential prevention reversal disease early year diagnosis quite large . One potential way improve glucose homeostasis intermittent fasting , also know alternate day fast . Intermittent fast mean switch eat fasting , variation calorie restriction . Intermittent fast studied animal . Together calorie restriction , intermittent fast efficient way expand lifespan many animal specie without genetically alter . A wide range age relate change delay include beneficial effect hypertension , degenerative brain disease , immune response , DNA repair capacity glucose homeostasis . Fat redistribution fat translocate organ liver subcutis . Little known intermittent fasting human . In 2005 investigator experimentally test concept young healthy male find 15 day alternate day fast food intake increase insulin sensitivity 16 % without change body weight . The explanation could oscillations cellular energy store . Skeletal muscle contains approximately 80 % stored glycogen alone virtue muscle mass . The liver high glycogen concentration , much small . A single prolonged ( &gt; 24 hr ) day fast may decrease muscle glycogen , decrease liver fast . A muscle glycogen lower effect continue intermittent fasting would expect , experimentally indicate . The intermittent fast method may appeal patient , exercise , need test intervention patient type 2 diabetes obvious .</detailed_description>
