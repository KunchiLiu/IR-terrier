	<brief_summary>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCCs ) mainly cause tobacco , alcohol consumption betel nut chew sixth common cancer world . Despite significant advance treatment modality involve surgery , radiotherapy , concomitant chemoradiotherapy , 5-year survival rate remain 50 % past 30 year . The bad prognosis cancer must certainly link fact HNSCCs strongly influence host immune system . During process , mesenchymal tumor-like cell highly mobile enter quickly adjacent structure ( intravasation ) , travel lymphatic blood vessel circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) , single cell malignant potential detect peripheral bloodstream essential establish metastasis . Programmed death 1 ( PD-1 ) ligand ( PD-L1 ) play pivotal role regulate host immune response . Substantial evidence demonstrate PD-L1 deliver inhibitory signal PD-1 express T cell , lead suppression immune response induce apoptosis , energy , unresponsiveness functional exhaustion T cell . However , inhibitory effect pathway function cytotoxic T lymphocytes , main effector cell HNSCC patient , well define . In study aim solve two main problem : one improve try optimize current protocol CTC isolation base investigator previous work , one challenging problem CTC field date ; understand status immune system HNSCC patient , especially focus PD-1-PD-L1 pathway expression . After series basic experiment immune cell analysis conditional adjustment CTC isolation protocol , investigateor willing isolate CTCs immune cell single blood drawing time . A prospective trial conduct elucidate role PD-1 expression lymphocytes CTC number clinical outcome HNSCC patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . To establish platform increase efficiency purity isolation enumeration circulate tumor cell patient head neck cancer . 2 . Compare differences determine efficient method combination negative , positive selection , optoelectronic dielectrophoresis ( ODEP ) flow cytometry sort technology . 1 . Negative Selection 2 . Positive Selection 3 . ODEP device 4 . Flow Cytometry Sorting System 3 . Use upgraded platform test among different group efficiency test . ( Planned subject : healthy donor : n=30 ; early-stage ( stage I=II ) patients=9 ; locally-advanced=9 metastatic , n=9 ; total n=60 ) - Clinical Enrollment Device/Method Validation 4 . To confirm PD-1 expression could successfully detect up-regulated cytotoxic T cell use cell line ( NK-92 ) . 1 . Cell Culture NK-92 , OECM-1 , SCC-4 K562 2 . Immunostaining method PD-1 expression 3 . Flow cytometry ratio PD-1 expression 5 . To observe functional change cytototic T cell PD-1 expression use cell line immunomagnetic bead-based isolation method . 1 . Positive Isolation PD-1 Expressing Cells 2 . CD107a cytotoxicity assay 3 . Cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay 6 . Confirm find whole blood sample healthy donor ( n=15 ) HNSCC patient ( n=15 ) . - Clinical Enrollment Patients PD-1 expression PBMCs , stage validation previous finding 7 . Using platform establish first-year project , isolate check CTC number locally advance metastatic HNSCC patient validation . 8 . To check ratio circulate CD56+ cell PD-1 expression locally advance metastatic HNSCC patient validation . 9 . To correlate clinical relevance circulate PD-1+CD56 cell CTCs locally advance metastatic HNSCC patient ( N=60 year ) . Another Healthy donor ( n=15 ) need reference . 1 . CTC enumeration sort technique-Negative Selection Strategy 2 . Positive Selection 3 . ODEP device 4 . Flow Cytometry Sorting System 5 .
