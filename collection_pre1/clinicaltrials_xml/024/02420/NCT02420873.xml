	<brief_title>An Open-label Phase II Study Lorvotuzumab Mertansine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatment : If find eligible take part study , receive lorvotuzumab vein Days 1 8 ( +/- 2 day ) cycle . It may take minute several hour receive study drug . Your doctor discus . All treatment IMGN901 must administer MD Anderson . Each cycle 21 day ( +/-6 day ) . However , may longer short depend if/how disease respond treatment , bone marrow react treatment , doctor think best interest . Your dose lorvotuzumab may raise , lower , and/or delay doctor think best interest . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle , physical exam . One ( 1 ) time week first 4 cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . After Cycle 4 , blood draw 1 time every 2-4 week . If doctor think need , blood may need drawn . The study doctor study staff discuss blood need . During first cycle , laboratory evaluation do MD Anderson . After Cycle 1 , may able blood draw perform local lab clinic closer home , result report research nurse study MD Anderson . The study doctor study staff discus option . The result blood draws sent study doctor review . On Day 21 Cycle 1 ( +/- 7 day ) , every 1-3 cycle , bone marrow aspiration/biopsy check status disease . If doctor think need , may do less often , depend response study drug . You blood draws and/or bone marrow aspiration time doctor think need study . If stay study 6 month side effect , may test less frequently . For example , may bone marrow aspiration 1 time every 6-12 month blood draws 1 time cycle . The study doctor discus . Length Study : You may take 12 cycle lorvotuzumab . If doctor think best interest , may able continue receive study drug beyond Cycle 12 . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up . End-of-Study Visit : If leave study end Cycle 12 , within 30 day ( +/- 7 day ) last dose study drug : - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease . Long Term Follow-Up : If disease appear get well respond well study drug , return MD Anderson every 3-6 month 5 year last dose study drug study staff check . If return MD Anderson visit , may call member study staff . The call last 10 minute . This investigational study . Lorvotuzumab FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain drug design work . Up 60 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients CD56 express hematological malignancy , follow : Cohort 1 : CD56 express hematological malignancy include limited AML , highrisk MDS , naturalkiller leukemia , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , accelerate blastphase CML fail prior therapy standard therapy exists.Cohort 2 : Patients MF ( either primary MF , postpolycythemia MF , postessential thrombocythemia MF ) CD56 expression ruxolitinib JAKinhibitor therapy least 12 week deem refractory suboptimal responder opinion treat physician.Cohort 3 : Patients pathological diagnosis BPDCN CD56 expression ( frontline relapsed/refractory ) . 2 . Any level CD56 expression consider sufficient enrollment study . 3 . Prior therapy hydroxyurea , chemotherapy , biological target therapy ( e.g . FLT3 inhibitor , kinase inhibitor ) , hematopoietic growth factor allow . 4 . Age &gt; /=18 year 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status &lt; /= 2 6 . Adequate organ function : total bilirubin &lt; /= 2 time upper limit normal ( x ULN ) ( &lt; /=3 x ULN consider due leukemic involvement Gilbert 's syndrome ) ; aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; /= 2.5 x ULN ( &lt; /= 5.0 x ULN consider due leukemic involvement ) ; serum creatinine &lt; /= 2 x ULN , amylase lipase &lt; /=2 x ULN . 7 . In absence rapidly progress disease discussion Principal Investigator ( PI ) , interval prior treatment time IMGN901 administration least 2 week least 5 halflives cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agent . The halflife base publish pharmacokinetic literature ( abstract , manuscript , investigator brochure 's , drugadministration manual ) document protocol eligibility document . 8. continuation criterion # 7 : For prior monoclonal antibody therapy interval prior monoclonal antibody treatment time IMGN901 administration least 2 week . The use chemotherapeutic antileukemic agent hydroxyurea ( define protocol ) permit study exception intrathecal ( IT ) therapy patient control CNS leukemia discretion PI . Hydroxyurea allow prior initiation IMGN901 first 3 cycle , either prior concomitantly IMGN901 administration initially control Leukocytosis . 9 . Women childbearing potential must practice contraception . Females childbearing potential : Recommendation 2 effective contraceptive method study . Adequate form contraception double barrier method ( condom spermicidal jelly foam diaphragm spermicidal jelly foam ) , oral , depo provera , injectable contraceptive , intrauterine device , tubal ligation . Male patient female partner childbearing potential : Recommendation male partner use least 2 effective contraceptive method , describe , study . 10 . Females must surgically biologically sterile postmenopausal ( amenorrheic least 12 month ) childbearing potential , must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour start treatment 11 . Patients must provide write informed consent . 12 . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate method contraception study 3 month last treatment . Males must surgically biologically sterile agree use adequate method contraception study 3 month last treatment . Adequate method contraception include : Total abstinence line prefer usual lifestyle patient . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment Male sterilization ( least 6 month prior screen ) . 13. continue criterion # 12 : For female patient study , vasectomize male partner sole partner patient Combination two follow ( a+b a+c b+c ) Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception form hormonal contraception comparable efficacy ( failure rate &lt; 1 % ) , example hormone vaginal ring transdermal hormone contraception Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository In case use oral contraception , woman stable pill take study treatment . Note : Oral contraceptive allow used conjunction barrier method contraception due unknown effect drugdrug interaction 14. continue criterion # 13 Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential . 1 . Patients know allergy hypersensitivity IMGN901 . 2 .
