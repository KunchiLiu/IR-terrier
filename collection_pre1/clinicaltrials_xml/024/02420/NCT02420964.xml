	<detailed_description>Study Design : The study prospective randomize trial involve human subject . The study population consist infertility patient present Carolinas Medical Center Women 's Institute require injectable use . Exclusion criterion : Any patient prior history IVF injectable use exclude study . Independent Variables : The independent variable random assignment participant receive either web-based one one teaching . Outcome Variables : The primary outcome variable level knowledge intervention . Secondary outcome variable include level satisfaction education , preference educational method , time require teach . Confounding Variables : Potentially confound variable include age , race , prior experience web-based teaching . Methods : 1 . A responsible clinician acquaint himself/herself research protocol explain study patient . Patients agree participate sign form document informed consent . The patient hand envelope determine whether receive web-based teach one-on-one teaching . 2 . The patient receive web-based teaching take private room watch video injectable medication use . The amount time require view video record . The video pause , rewound watch many time patient desire . 3 . The patient randomize one-on-one teaching take separate room taught injectable medication use one two training healthcare provider experience teach injectable medication . The time spent teaching session record . 4 . After teach session , patient study complete multiple choice post-test regard knowledge injectable medication use . They also complete satisfaction survey use Likert scale ass patient ' response . The instructor teach one-on-one session access post-test . Statistics : The categorical variable summarize frequency percentages continuous variable evaluate mean standard deviation . A difference proportion test base data collect web-based group didactic group . Non-inferiority test conduct base difference 5 % significance level . Data analysis conduct use SAS statistical software ( 9.2 , Cary , NC , USA ) . Sample Size Estimate : To predict web-based test group inferior Didactic test group 40 people group would need achieve 80 % power 5 % significance level . The sample size need calculate use Z-test . Here assume didactic group would get 80 % answer correct web-based group would actually 90 % answer correct .</detailed_description>
