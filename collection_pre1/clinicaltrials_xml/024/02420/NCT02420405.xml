	<brief_summary>The objective study compare value routine gene test next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) detect gene mutation small specimen obtain endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA ) get knowledge many EBUS-TBNA sample adequate NGS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mutation Detection EBUS-TBNA Specimens Using NGS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some gene mutation direct individualize treatment . The routine gene test EGFR , ROS1 ALK direct sequencing , Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-QPCR ) fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) new technique , sensitive routine technique . So decide compare value gene test routine method NGS EBUS-TBNA specimens get knowledge many EBUS-TBNA sample adequate NGS . The study design prospective single center study . Seventy patient enrol study clinical data patient , include smoke history , cancer history , occupation exposure , collect record case report form . For patient recruit study , lymph node suspect malignant obtain EBUS-TBNA . Samples send Pathology Department Shanghai Chest Hospital process paraffin-embedded , diagnose nonsquamous NSCLC , routine gene test EGFR , ROS1 ALK perform . And rest tissue extract DNA perform gene mutation use NGS qualify DNA sample .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients suspect nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer accord clinical , lab examination image data never diagnose primary lung cancer enrol study . 2 . The clinical stage patient stage IIIAIV judge image data ca n't receive surgery initially . 4 . There exist least one lesion obtain EBUSTBNA . 1 . The patient highly suspect benign lesion , small cell lung cancer squamous cell carcinoma accord clinical data . 2 . Surgery consider primary treatment . 3 . Patients diagnose lung cancer receive treatment drug recurrent lung cancer exclude . 4 . Severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction indication ca n't tolerate bronchoscopy .</criteria>
