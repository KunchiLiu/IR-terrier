	<brief_title>Study Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid ( SAHA ) With Temsirolimus Children With Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma ( DIPG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , participant 1 2 study group base participant diagnose DIPG : - If participant newly diagnose DIPG , participant Group 1 . Participant receive radiation therapy vorinostat , combination vorinostat temsirolimus . - If participant diagnose DIPG disease gotten bad since , participant Group 2 . Participant receive combination vorinostat temsirolimus without receive radiation therapy . Study Drug Administration : Participant assign dose level temsirolimus base participant join study . Up 2 dose level temsirolimus test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . The second group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . All participant receive dose level vorinostat , though dose may lower intolerable side effect . Vorinostat take food . Participant careful open break capsule vorinostat . If capsule break , participant try clean carefully without breathe powder . Participant wash spill area least 3 time ethyl alcohol , rinse 1 time water . If powder come contact participant 's skin , participant wash affect area thoroughly soap water . If participant trouble swallowing , participant may receive vorinostat liquid form . The dose amount base participant 's body surface area . The MD Anderson pharmacy give participant drug liquid form . Participant store liquid form drug room temperature , away excessive heat humidity . The liquid form drug take food . Participant avoid spill powder capsule liquid form drug participant 's skin . If contact occurs , participant wash area thoroughly water . Group 1 : Participant receive 30 treatment radiation therapy 6-7 week . Participant sign separate consent form treatment explain procedure , well risk benefit . Participant take capsule vorinostat food , every morning participant radiation treatment ( Monday - Friday ) least 1-2 hour radiation . After participant finish radiation therapy , participant rest 4 week participant receive radiation therapy study drug . After , participant start receive chemotherapy combination vorinostat temsirolimus 28-day study cycle : - Participant take capsule vorinostat food 1 time every day Days 1-8 cycle . - Participant receive temsirolimus vein 30 minute Days 1 8 cycle . Group 2 : Participant receive chemotherapy combination vorinostat temsirolimus 28-day study cycle : - Participant take capsule vorinostat food 1 time every day Days 1-8 cycle . - Participant receive temsirolimus vein 30 minute Days 1 8 cycle . Study Visits Group 1 Radiation Therapy : Every week : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Study Visits All Participants Chemotherapy : Every week : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every week Cycle 1 , begin every cycle , urine collect routine test . At begin every odd-numbered cycle ( 1 , 3 , 5 , ) , participant MRI brain check status disease . If doctor think need , also include MRI spine . If participant Group 2 , need perform Cycle 1 since participant 's screening scan recently perform . Length Study : If participant Group 1 , participant receive radiation therapy chemotherapy 7 week , follow 4 week rest , follow 10 cycle chemotherapy alone . If participant isin Group 2 , participant receive 12 cycle chemotherapy . Participant longer able receive study treatment disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Dosing Visi : After participant finish receive chemotherapy , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Follow-Up : Participant follow-up visit 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month participant ' finish receive chemotherapy . The following test procedure perform : - Participant physical exam . - Participant MRI brain spine check status disease . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test ( Month 3 follow-up visit ) . This investigational study . Vorinostat FDA approve commercially available treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . Temsirolimus FDA approve commercially available treatment kidney cancer . The use drug combination investigational . The radiation therapy deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method . The study doctor explain study drug ( ) design work . Up 18 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
