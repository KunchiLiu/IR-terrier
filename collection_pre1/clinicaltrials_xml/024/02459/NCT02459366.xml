	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic myofascial low back pain ( CMLBP ) common musculoskeletal disease . Deep fascia structure insufficient theory spinal stability , major biomechanical role thoracolumbar fascia segmental control stability spine sacroiliac joint , biomechanical role influence mechanical property fascia . Fascia provide function sensation coordination , helpful discussion compensatory mechanism patient chronic low back pain , contribution development appropriate therapeutic strategy combine treatment innovative application . However due lack understanding myofascia , difficulty diagnosis treatment . It necessary establish method assess fascia complete series study understand fascia attach muscle . Objective : The objective three-year research investigate relationship thoracolumbar fascia tissue characteristic , lumbopelvic asymmetry , core muscle contractility , proprioception stand balance different age asymptomatic participant patient CMLBP . Method : 270 subject recruit study , age range 20 74 year old . 120 subject patient CMLBP 150 asymptomatic participant . Instrument use include real time ultrasound imaging , Zebris 3D motionanalysis system force plate system . The first year establish reliability measurement lumbopelvic asymmetry , mechanical physical property thoracolumbar fascia , norm different age . The second year compare difference among asymptomatic subject patient without lumbopelvic asymmetry , investigate whether lumbopelvic symmetry , core muscle contractility , proprioception stand balance change manipulate thoracolumbar fascia tissue physical therapy . The third year investigate treatment effect chronic myofascial back pain patient 8 week exercise train aid physical agent .</detailed_description>
