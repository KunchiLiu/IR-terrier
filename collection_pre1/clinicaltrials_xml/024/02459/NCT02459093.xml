	<brief_title>Subcuticular Suture Cesarean Skin Incision Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States cesarean delivery rate 2012 32.8 % . The incidence wind complication post-cesarean delivery quote anywhere 3-30 % . Wound complication include surgical site infection ( SSI ) , hematoma , seroma , wound separation . Risk factor wind complication include elevate body mass index ( BMI ) , prolonged duration surgery , maternal diabetes , coexist infection ( chorioamnionitis ) , anemia , increase number prior cesarean delivery . The majority cesarean delivery perform suprapubic low-transverse skin incision ( Pfannenstiel incision ) . The incidence wound complication post-cesarean comparing suture staple skin closure extensively studied conclusion recommend suture skin closer . A comparison type suture use skin close wound complication widely study . Vats et al . compare three type suture material post-cesarean wound complication find statistical difference wound discomfort , swell induration , wound discharge , wound dehiscence . Their quote wound complication rate high thirty-three percent . Although , study population limited emergent cesarean delivery , sample size small , method randomization explain . Physiologic wound heal involves five step : inflammation , granulation , epithelialization , wound contraction , scar maturation . These biologic process overlap occurrence happen define order . Investigators hypothesize suture material differ profile different effect biologic process . The two widely use suture low-transverse cesarean skin incision closure institution poliglecaprone 25 polyglactin 910 . Poliglecaprone 25 ( monocryl ) monofilament suture absorption profile 91-119 day . Polyglactin 910 ( coat vicryl ) braid suture absorption profile 56-70 day . Given difference profile suture physiologic wound heal process investigator question would effective wound healing . The purpose study : 1 . To compare poliglecaprone 25 polyglactin 910 suture Pfannenstiel incision closure prevention wound complication ( SSI , hematoma , seroma , wound separation ) . 2 . To determine risk factor wound complication guide choice suture use closure Pfannenstiel incision . Methods Patient enrollment occur admission labor delivery . Patients approach meet enrollment criterion . If agree participate trial pre-randomized sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope assign open time cesarean delivery assign surgical suture use skin closure . Inclusion criterion trial : 1 . Gestational age 37 complete week great base estimate due date calculate last menstrual period early ultrasound . 2 . Scheduled cesarean delivery ... 3 . Non-emergent cesarean delivery Patients participate undergo either : 1 . Scheduled cesarean delivery 2 . Non-emergent cesarean delivery Non-emergent cesarean delivery define indicated cesarean delivery base obstetrical criterion without significant fetal heart trace abnormality . This would include woman diagnose labor dystocia arrest labor , fail labor induction , fetal malpresentation labor ( i.e . breech presentation ) non-emergent indication cesarean delivery immediate danger mother fetus . The following exclusion criterion use : 1 . Urogenital tract infection within 2 week prior surgery 2 . Chronic oral injectable steroid use ( &gt; 2 week ) 3 . Emergency cesarean delivery ( need deliver immediately due maternal fetal indication ) 4 . Vertical skin incision 5 . Participation another research study The patient randomize informed consent obtain two group . Group 1 : Incision closure poliglecaprone 25 suture Group 2 : Incision closure polyglactin 910 suture Randomization study generate use www.randomization.com , block 6 10 prior start enrollment trial . Sequentially numbered , opaque , seal envelope contain surgical suture use skin closure , poliglecaprone 25 polyglactin 910 . Surgical preparation follow departmental protocol . Once patient randomized suture group correspond suture pull place sterile field use completion cesarean accordance manufacturer 's guideline . Cesarean delivery occur follow technique surgeon . Maternal demographic obtain include BMI , gestational age , pre postoperative day # 1 complete blood count , estimate blood loss , type preoperative skin preparation , surgical time skin incision closure , birth weight , Apgar score , newborn outcome , indication cesarean delivery , medical history antenatal complication , past surgical history , postoperative course , intraoperative postoperative complication . Wound complication define wound separation â‰¥ 1 cm length , hematoma seroma ( serous fluid collection subcutaneous blood collection ) , surgical site infection define Center Disease Control ( CDC ) guideline . The primary outcome include composite finding wound complication 30 day period post-operatively . All patient follow routine postpartum visit occur 6-8 week follow delivery primary prenatal care provider . Postpartum visit information extract medical record . All patient receive follow telephone call post-operative day 30 great monitor post-operative complication list . An alert notification place patient 's medical record enrol study close monitoring documentation cesarean incision necessary . The definition wound complication list first paragraph include alert notification standardize reporting patient . Recruitment Mechanisms Clinicians ask patient admission labor delivery meet enrollment criterion whether interested study . Consent obtain research clinician . Informed Consent Patient consent occur admission labor delivery unit . The capacity patient provide ethically adequate informed consent assess PI designee . It possible patient enrol labor prior cesarean section significant pain although majority patient present scheduled cesarean section prior labor . Consent obtain woman active labor labor analgesia occur . Emergency cesarean exclude .</detailed_description>
