	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate whether 50cc TAH-t safely support , provide probable benefit , transplant-eligible pediatric patient ( age 10 - 18 year ) safely effectively support transplant-eligible adult patient ( age 19 - 75 year ) imminent risk death biventricular failure without experience permanent disabling , stroke-related deficit . The study conduct three-arm trial 50cc temporary Total Artificial Heart ( TAH-t ) bridge transplant : - The Primary Pediatric Arm trial evaluate safety probable benefit 50cc TAH-t transplant-eligible patient 10 18 year age . - The Primary Adult Arm trial evaluate safety efficacy 50cc TAH-t transplant-eligible patient 19 75 year age . - The Secondary Arm capture pediatric adult subject meet enrollment criterion Primary Arm , meet less restrictive Secondary Arm enrollment criterion , order characterize use device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart failure reduce ability native heart pump blood maintain normal bodily function . Heart transplantation standard care treatment end-stage heart failure supply donor heart insufficient meet need many patient eligible transplantation age comorbid condition . On 15 October 2004 , SynCardia 70cc temporary TAH-t System receive Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval Premarket Approval Application ( PMA ) # P030011 in-hospital use bridge transplant ( BTT ) cardiac transplant-eligible candidate risk imminent death biventricular failure . The system consist implantable TAH-t external pneumatic driver . Subsequent original approval , two additional external pneumatic driver approve use 70cc TAH-t. On 30 January 2013 , FDA grant Humanitarian Use Designation ( HUD ) 50cc TAH-t use BTT pediatric patient biventricular heart failure body surface area ( BSA ) sufficiently accommodate device . To evaluate ability device support patient small support 70cc TAH-t , SynCardia conduct clinical study . The study conduct three-arm trial 50cc temporary Total Artificial Heart ( TAH-t ) bridge transplant : - The Primary Pediatric Arm trial evaluate safety probable benefit 50cc TAH-t transplant-eligible patient 10 18 year age . - The Primary Adult Arm trial evaluate safety efficacy 50cc TAH-t transplant-eligible patient 19 75 year age . - The Secondary Arm capture pediatric adult subject meet enrollment criterion pediatric arm , meet less restrictive Secondary Arm enrollment criterion , order characterize use device . Pediatric subject data six month post-implant report FDA support Humanitarian Device Exemption ( HDE ) application orphan indication pediatric patient alternative replacement device . Pediatric subject ( enrolled Primary Pediatric Arm Secondary Arm ) continue TAH-t support six month study visit continue follow study every six month transplant , withdrawal study , subject respective arm reach endpoint , death , whichever occur first . The primary objective Primary Pediatric Arm study evaluate whether 50cc TAH-t safely support , provide probable benefit , transplant-eligible pediatric patient imminent risk death biventricular failure without experience permanent disabling , stroke-related deficit . Probable benefit measure transplant first six month , survival six month continue support initially place 50cc TAH-t , without experience permanent disable stroke-related deficit . Safety evaluate characterization adverse event ( AE ) profile six month study end date . AEs identify term definition Pedimacs/Intermacs Registry . The secondary endpoint establish safety pediatric adult arm measure performance goal ( base prior experience 70cc TAH-t ) four adverse event category likely delay preclude transplant . The four category : Major infection ( sepsis ) , Neurological event ( CVA ) , Chronic renal dysfunction , Major device failures/malfunctions per Pedimacs/Intermacs AE definition . Adult patient data six month post-implant report FDA support Premarket application ( PMA ) treatment small-statured adult patient unable accommodate 70cc TAH-t chest cavity alternative replacement device . Adult subject ( enrolled Primary Adult Arm Secondary Arm ) follow six month post-implant , continue support time , continue follow study every six month transplant , withdrawal study , subject respective arm reach endpoint , death , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
