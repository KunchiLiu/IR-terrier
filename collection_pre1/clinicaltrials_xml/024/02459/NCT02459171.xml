	<brief_summary>This study seek determine incidence transmission avian influenza virus human expose poultry . Enrolled subject select five different rural area ( village ) Nile delta region Egypt poultry commonly raise . From study site , 2400 healthy subject monitor 6 year annual follow visit measure sero-prevalence exposure variable , importantly , biweekly weekly visit measure incidence infection , measure secondary transmission rate , monitor symptom , assess immunological response . Primary Objectives : - To estimate incidence avian influenza ( AI ) poultry-exposed human population . - To estimate sero-prevalent AI poultry-exposed human population . - To investigate potential risk factor associate AI human infection poultry-exposed individual . - To investigate secondary infection risk household contact . Secondary Objectives : - To characterize antigenic genetic makeup AI viruses infect human . - To monitor pathogenicity disease severity AI viruses cause human infection associate immune response . - To investigate serologic response follow confirm influenza virus infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Household Transmission Zoonotic Influenza Viruses Cohort Egyptian Poultry Growers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All resident household invite participate . After study enrollment , participant complete questionnaire collect data demographic health status subject poultry keep household . A 3-ml blood sample obtain subject serological testing . Field nurse physicians visit household biweekly ( October March ) weekly ( April September ) determine subject influenza-like illness ( ILI ) , define accord Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) criterion measure fever ≥38ºC . cough and/or sore throat . Subjects confirm ILI ( index case ) provide two nasal swab point-of-care rapid influenza A test PCR . For test positive influenza A rapid test PCR nasal swab ( day 1 ) , two 3-ml blood sample obtain . In addition , nasal wash , throat swab , blood sample obtain household contact . Cloacal swab also collect poultry household day 1 . The index case household contact re-sampled nasal wash throat swab day 3 , 6 , 9 14 post initial diagnosis data , additional 3-ml blood sample obtain day 14 serological testing . Household contact report ILI symptoms follow-up visit index case follow follow-up regimen original index case . At annual follow-up final visit , questionnaire data update need , 3-ml blood sample obtain subject serological testing .</detailed_description>
