In 2010 , University Pavia join Cancer Genome Project , consortium international research Centers coordinate Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Cambridge aim elucidate molecular basis cancer . In context , use massive genome sequencing , recurrent mutation SF3B1 gene - encode core component RNA splice machinery - describe myelodysplastic syndrome . Moreover last year , researcher University Pavia give significant contribution definition molecular basis lymphoid neoplasm ( i.e. , BRAF V600E mutation Hairy cell Leukemia , MYD88 L265P mutation Waldenstrom disease , SF3B1 mutation Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ) . Finally , last month Universisty Pavia key role identification CALR mutation JAK2-negative MPN . This important finding comprehension genetic basis group disease . In addition implementation next-generation technique ( NGS ) genomic analysis , clearly need develop effective solution analyze integrate molecular clinical data large patient population , order fully understand relationship genotype clinical expression disease . The implementation molecular medicine require systematic approach base integration scientific , clinical technological expertise . In Italy , ideal context development molecular medicine program represent hematological regional network . They represent innovative model organization collaboration , base networking health care facility . The Rete Ematologica Lombarda ( REL , www.rel-lombardia.net ) bring together 11 hematological referral centre recently provide basis systematic study disease . The strategic objective REL clinical network ensure good access health care facility , high quality service continuity care hematological patient . REL clinical network give crucial contribute translational research hematological malignancy recently , purpose , Regione Lombardia January 2014 finance biotechnology cluster implementation genomic analysis development new treatment hematological disease . The REL biotechnology cluster ( www.relab-lombardia.net ) involve Department Hematology Oncology , Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo , University Pavia , biotech company Clonit ( www.clonit.it ) pharmaceutical company Novartis . This cluster aim investigate molecular basis hematological malignancy develop personalized treatment . 2 .
