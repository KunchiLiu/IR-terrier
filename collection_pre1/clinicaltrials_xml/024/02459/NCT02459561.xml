	<brief_summary>The management obesity challenge obesity surgery far effective treatment currently available . Recent medical research indicate also improves management blood glucose level people type 2 diabetes . Obesity surgery carry different risk benefit important balance choose right procedure patient . Therefore new effective strategy prevent reduce obesity complication type 2 diabetes mellitus need . This study design see whether new device call EndoBarrier Gastrointestinal Liner help patient manage blood sugar level lose weight . It randomise , placebo control trial compare potential EndoBarrier device conventional drug therapy , diet exercise obesity relate type 2 diabetes , effectiveness metabolic state ( HbA1c reduce 20 % blood pressure 135/85 ) , weight loss , quality life . It evaluate whether condition may relate obesity could become less severe collect information complication determine safety device . The study also perform various measurement test understand underlie mechanism device . After initial screen visit determine patient eligibility , invite 14 subsequent visit . Patients randomise either EndoBarrier device standard medical therapy treatment 12 month follow another 12 month follow-up period . They also routinely see specialist dietitian provide dietetic support throughout study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EndoBarrier TM Gastrointestinal Liner Diabetes Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit via primary care secondary care trust . After initial screen visit determine subject 's eligibility , randomise either EndoBarrier Control arm ( conventional medical therapy include dietary counselling ) , invite 15 study visit 24 month . The standard medical therapy drug titration carry accordance guideline American Diabetes Association . These guideline choose applicable International audience thus would adhere current best worldwide practice would still likely relevant result trial publish follow study completion . Patients receive intervention 12 month follow 12 month . They contact via telephone visit monitor problem boost motivation . The main outcome study compare EndoBarrier device conventional medical therapy , diet exercise obesity relate type 2 diabetes effectiveness : 1 . Metabolic state define International Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) HbA1c &lt; 6 % ( &lt; 42 mmol/mol ) blood pressure &lt; 135/85mmHg 2 . Absolute weight loss . Patients also invite participate one 3 sub-groups part mechanistic study ( Group 1 : functional MRI ( fMRI ) , Group 2 : insulin clamp Group 3 : food preference ) . Participation sub-studies optional . The following assessment perform visit 1 ( Screening Visit ) : Informed consent , inclusion exclusion criterion , demographic , medical history , physical examination , body measurement include height , weight waist , vital sign , ECG , urine albumin-creatinine ratio , routine haematology biochemistry , C13 urea breath test urine pregnancy test , applicable . Additional check complete subject consent take part sub-group mechanistic study . Once data include blood test result related screening obtain , Investigator review subject 's eligibility continue trial . If subject eligible review , subject randomise one two study arm ( EndoBarrier Control ) . Both group undergo follow measurement : - Body weight waist circumference , blood pressure , change illness medication adverse event check visit . - Blood sample obtain 13 visit - Urine albumin : creatinine ratio : urine sample collect visit 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 14 - Questionnaires ( Health Economics ) complete visit 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 14 . - Dietary counselling : visit 2 , 4 ( control arm ) , 6 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 subject receive diet ( either group individually ) qualify dietitian . EndoBarrier group : Visit 2 ( - 4 week ) include dietary counselling dietitian , dietary preparation pre- post-intervention medical consultation ( include distribution proton pump inhibitor ) preparation EndoBarrier implant . At visit 4 ( 0 week ) EndoBarrier device implant . The subject attend hospital fast state receive general anaesthetic device placement procedure . A small tube ( endoscope ) insert mouth guide small intestine visual examination area physician . Then guide wire insert endoscope , endoscope remove guide wire leave place . A capsule ( contain device ) place guide wire guide destination small intestine . The physician see capsule x-ray move towards small intestine . When physician determines capsule reach correct location , guide wire remove , release device . When device release , also release small plastic ball ( slightly large pea ) . The ball excrete naturally via stool . Normally , cause discomfort . The device remain small intestine remove 12 month . After procedure ( 12 hour ) subject may need stay overnight hospital physician monitor condition , usually require . During insertion fluroscopy use determine position device . Videos photo fluoroscopy image record help investigator make treatment decision may pass study sponsor . The image contain patient identifiable data label initial study participation number . At visit 11 ( 12 month ) EndoBarrier device remove . The removal procedure comparable placement procedure usually require less time . Before device removal procedure , subject receive general anaesthetic . During device removal , endoscope insert mouth guide small intestine visual examination area physician . A guide wire insert endoscope . The end endoscope small hook , physician use pull device back endoscope . The endoscope contain device remove mouth . The physician insert endoscope inspect area device place . After procedure , subject return home . All subject EndoBarrier arm see gastroenterologist equivalent specialist study visit 2 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 15 discuss well-being question regard EndoBarrier implant . EndoBarrier patient also receive frequent review diabetes specialist review medication regimen ( visit 2 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 13 15 ) . Control group ( Standard Medical Therapy ) Standard medical therapy carry accordance guideline American Diabetes Association . Patients see visit 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 15 follow-up diabetes control diabetes specialist . Both group provide blood sample DNA/RNA sampling : visit 3 sample metabolomics ( blood , urine , feces ) : visit 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 14 Subjects agree participate sub-study asked complete additional test include : - Fasting Gut hormone metabolite ( Group 1-3 ) : visit 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 14 - Post meal gut hormone metabolite ( Group 1 3 ) : visit 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 - Eating behaviour questionnaire ( Group 1-3 ) : visit 3 , 8 , 10 14 - Functional MRI ( Group 1 ) : visit 3 8 - Taste Food preference ( Group 3 ) : visit 3 , 5 , 8 - Eating behaviour computerise task ( Group 1 3 ) : visit 3 , 8 , 10 14 - Cognitive Assessment task ( Group 1 ) : visit 3 , 8 10 - Insulin Clamps ( Group 2 ) : visit 3 , 5 , 8</detailed_description>
