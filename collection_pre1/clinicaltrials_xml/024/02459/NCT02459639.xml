	<brief_summary>Using comprehensive prospective clinical study design , investigator intend compare change health-related marker patient chronic widespread pain ( CWP ) , undergo one two intervention `` package '' multimodal health care , namely anthroposophical integrative care ( AIC ) standard care ( SC ) , respectively . AIC combine evidence-based conventional care complementary/alternative ( CAM ) treatment . As marker , investigator use indicator drug utilization sick leave , well construct mirror possible change psychological existential factor genomic stability ( telomere length telomerase level ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Existential Genomics : Effects Multimodal Rehabilitation Integrative Care Patients With Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose comprehensive prospective clinical study compare contrast two different well-established multimodal chronic widespread pain rehabilitation programme , i.e . one conventional county council hospital ( CC ) one involve integrative care private non-profit hospital ( IC ) , term change health-related outcome , range DNA stability health economy , patient chronic pain . Notably , first time , difference see correlation make CC IC outcomes relevance clinical care development implementation multimodal intervention people chronic pain . The overall aim present prospective clinical trial achieve good understand possible effect , useful measure evaluate , two different multimodal treatment intervention pain . More specifically , aim trial explore two different , well-established multimodal pain rehabilitation programme . The investigator specifically investigate 1 . If chronic pain impact patient ' telomerase activity telomere length time ; 2 . If multimodal rehabilitation link positive change telomerase activity telomere length rehabilitation , change correlate : Clinical diagnosis , pain characteristic ( e.g . intensity , duration , frequency spread pain ) , co-morbidities ( e.g . anxiety , depression catastrophizing ) , time lose work/sick-leave self-rated health stress , ; 3 . If two programme treatment component differ outcomes time . The project outcomes great relevance clinical rehabilitation development implementation multimodal intervention people chronic pain . Given significant demographic clinical factor associate pain help-seeking increase age , female gender , pain severity disability , also address issue include gender difference relevant . Specific work package ( WP ) : WP1 - Genomics ( telomerase activity telomere length ) ; WP2 - Patient-reported outcome ( `` existential '' validate questionnaire regard depression , anxiety , stress , quality life , pain , mindfulness , spirituality/religiosity ) ; WP3 - Health care experience ( interview ) ; WP4 - Registry data ( drug , health care , sick leave , return-to-work , morbidity , mortality ) ; WP5 - The design treatment program ; WP6 - Standardized exploratory statistical analysis difference correlation collect data conventional integrated care program . WP7 - Implementation result problematized participation representative patient care provider organization .</detailed_description>
