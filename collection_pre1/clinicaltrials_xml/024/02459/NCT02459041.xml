	<detailed_description>1 . Background Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) technique major clinical impact digestive disease , determine change diagnosis management half examine patient [ 1 ] . Recent advance EUS-FNA technique , also development real-time EUS elastography contrast-enhancement , allow good characterization focal pancreatic mass , possible implication management patient negative EUS-FNA strong suspicion malignancy . 1.a Elastography Elastography recent ultrasound method use reconstruction tissue elasticity distribution real-time [ 2 ] . The method allow calculation elasticity modulus , consequently show difference tissue hardness pattern determine disease . The main intend use differentiate benign malignant focal lesion base significantly small strain latter [ 3 ] . Second generation elastography introduces strain ratio ( SR ) strain histogram ( SH ) reproducible parametric measurement retrieve numerical value real time , add quantification possibility technique [ 4 ] . Elastography typically estimate axial strain ( along direction insonification / compression ) analyze ultrasonic signal obtain standard ultrasonographic system - RF signal return tissue structure slight compression ( 1 % ) compare [ 5 ] . Tissue elastography easily perform conventional probe , include linear EUS probe use examination pancreas and/or lymph node . The calculation tissue elasticity distribution perform real-time freehand compression examination result represent transparent overlay colour image overimposed conventional gray-scale B-mode image [ 6 ] . Thus , method allow characterization many tumor , stiffer normal tissue . Ultrasound elastography previously use diagnosis non-digestive well digestive tumor : breast lesion [ 7 ] , prostate cancer [ 8 ] , thyroid nodule [ 9 ] , rectal tumor [ 10 ] . Regarding diagnosis pancreatic focal mass , author could differentiate malignancy benign tumor chronic pancreatitis [ 11 ] , others obtain good result , especially use computer assist mean evaluation like hue histogram analysis [ 12 ] artificial neural network [ 13 ] . More recently , lymph node involvement several tumor succesfully determine use method : esophagus [ 14 ] , oral squamous cell carcinoma [ 15 ] , breast cancer [ 16 ] . Since elastography image movie represent qualitative type output entail subjective interpretation examiner , human bias always susceptible interfere result diagnosis , due color perception error , move artifact , possible selection bias induce analysis still image . More objective , computer-assisted semi-quantitative mean interpret result develop , disadvantage labor-intensive use third-party software use real time [ 17 ] . Second generation elastography introduces strain ratio ( SR ) strain histogram ( SH ) two reproducible measurement retrieve numerical value real time , thus greatly reduce human bias without need third-party software [ 4 ] . SR calculate relative strain two region interest ( ROI ) ( normal pathological ) . SH measure strain value elemental area inside ROI divide measurement range interval ; strain value element fall interval , initial area normalize initial total surface area add run total interval ; total value interval use produce graph average value . Both SR SH already use vivo pancreatic mass lymph node , promise result [ 18 ] . 1. b Contrast-enhancement Ultrasound contrast agent conjunction contrast specific image technique increasingly accept clinical use diagnostic imaging [ 19 ] . The study pancreas new promising application contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CE-US ) , include contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound ( CE-EUS ) . The technique indicate improve detection pancreatic lesion , improve delineation differential diagnosis pancreatic lesion [ 20-23 ] . One fluoro-gas-containing contrast agent use CE-US CE-EUS Sonovue® , consist phospholipids-stabilized bubble sulfurhexafluoride ( SF6 ) [ 24 ] . Sonovue® isotonic , stable resistant pressure , viscosity similar blood . It diffuse extravascular compartment remain within blood vessel gas dissolve eliminate expired air ( blood pool contrast agent ) [ 25 ] . The safety profile SonoVue show low incidence side effect ; nephrotoxic incidence severe hypersensitivity similar magnetic resonance image contrast agent . Moreover , Sono-Vue approve clinical use EU country . The blood supply pancreas entirely arterial , make contrast-enhanced examination feasible readily available . Based European Federation Societies Ultrasound Medicine Biology guideline recommendation , updated 2008 , two phase define CE-US CE-EUS pancreas : early/arterial phase ( start 10 30 second ) venous/late phase ( 30 120 second ) [ 19 ] . Distinguishing pancreatic adenocarcinoma pancreatic mass remain challenge current image technique [ 22-27 ] . The specificity discrimination benign malignant focal pancreatic lesion find 93.3 % use power Doppler contrast-enhanced EUS ( PD-CE-EUS ) compare 83.3 % conventional EUS [ 26 ] . The hypovascular aspect lesion PD-CE-EUS seem highly sensitive specific ( high 90 % ) adenocarcinoma several publish study [ 22-27 ] . During PD-CE-EUS examination ultrasound frequency return transducer transmit , method associate artifact result turbulent flow ( flash overpainting ) [ 28 ] . At CE-EUS , ductal adenocarcinoma typically hypoenhanced compare adjacent pancreatic tissue phase [ 19 ] . Furthermore , lesion size margin well visualize , well relationship peripancreatic artery vein . Focal lesion chronic pancreatitis report similar hyper enhancement feature compare normal pancreatic parenchyma [ 19 ] . Dedicated contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS technique ( base low mechanical index ) recently available new EUS system . The harmonic frequency return CEH-EUS different transmit transducer result non-linear oscillation microbubbles [ 24 ] . The image obtain addition signal create distortion microbubbles tissue-derived signal . This optimized use low MI , allow minimum bubble destruction complete `` subtraction '' tissue derive signal , obtain high resolution continuous real-time assessment microvascularization contrast uptake period ( real-time perfusion image ) [ 29-31 ] . CEH-EUS allows precise location vascular structure within parenchyma focal abnormality , good delineation pancreatic lesion EUS , especially case air fat cause artifacts insufficient visualization pancreatic parenchyma . An initial pilot study describe experimental technique CEH-EUS base linear prototype EUS scope , low mechanical index ( 0.08 - 0.25 ) 2nd generation contrast agent ( Sono-Vue ) , allow visualization early arterial phase late parenchymal phase enhancement pancreas [ 32 ] . Another pilot study demonstrate real-time continuous image finely branch vessel pancreas intermittent homogenous parenchymal perfusion image , use radial prototype EUS scope , low mechanical index ( 0.4 ) 2nd generation contrast agent ( Sono-Vue ) [ 33 ] . Several research group already report feasibility CEH-EUS low mechanical index [ 34-36 ] . The sensitivity , specificity accuracy diagnose pancreatic adenocarcinoma 88 % , 89 % , 88.5 % one study [ 34 ] 80 % , 91.7 % , 86 % study [ 33 ] . However , data still limit prospective , multicentric blind study would certainly necessary . The study protocol base multi-center semi-quantitative approach EUS elastography data combination contrast-enhanced EUS , consist measure SR SH focal pancreatic mass lymph node , well several parameter CE-EUS base time-intensity-curve ( TIC ) analysis . A number parameter must take consideration , ROIs still manually select user . The aim study establish EUS base diagnostic algorithm patient pancreatic mass lymph node , negative inconclusive cytopathology EUS-FNA , base previously publish result cut-offs elastography contrast-enhancement . The propose algorithm sequential use real-time elastography , follow contrast-enhanced EUS could good clinical tool help select patient possible pancreatic adenocarcinoma malignant lymph node , set patient negative EUS-FNA result . 2 .
