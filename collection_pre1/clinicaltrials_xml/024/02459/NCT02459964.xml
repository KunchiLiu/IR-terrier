The study staff help participant use nasal spray . - If participant Group 2 , emergency center nurse give hydromorphone hydrochloride vein . Study Procedures : Participant stay emergency department least 4 hour monitor receive fentanyl hydromorphone hydrochloride . During time , participant ask pain side effect may every 15 minute 2 hour every 30 minute another 2 hour . The study staff also monitor participant 's vital sign , ask question end study . Length Study Participation : Although participant stay emergency department least 4 hour , average length stay participant severe pain 9 hour . When participant discharge emergency department admit hospital , active participation study . Follow-Up Phone Call : About 24 hour patient 's active participation , study nurse call ask side effect since take part study . The phone call last 5 minute . If participant still inpatient hospital , study nurse may visit ask question person . This investigational study . Hydromorphone hydrochloride FDA approve commercially available treatment pain .
