	<brief_summary>There significant unmet medical need rapidly act treatment subject severe major depressive disorder ( MDD ) adequately respond antidepressant therapy . Alternative therapy require week achieve full efficacy , may significant side effect , still fail high percentage subject . Rapid reduction severe depression pharmacological therapy important reduce need hospitalization risk self-harm mortality . CERC-301 , highly selective , orally bioavailable , N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor subunit 2B ( NR2B ) , also refer Glutamate NMDA receptor subunit epsilon-2 ( GluN2B ) antagonist , would therapeutic breakthrough provide rapid onset antidepressant effect effect size similar see experimental intravenous NMDA modulators .</brief_summary>
