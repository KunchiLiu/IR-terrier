	<criteria>Participants must meet follow inclusion criterion order eligible study : 1 . Is hospitalize male female , ≥ 18 year age Screening Visit ; 2 . Is mechanical ventilation ; 3 . Has know suspect mechanically ventilated bacterial pneumonia least 1 follow : Fever ( &gt; 38.5ﾟC &gt; 101.3ﾟF ) ; Hypothermia ( ≤ 35.0ﾟC ≤ 95.0ﾟF ) ; Leukopenia ( ≤ 4500 cells/mm3 ) ; Leukocytosis ( ≤ 10000 cells/mm3 ) ; White blood cell count leave shift define &gt; 15 % immature polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( band ) peripheral blood smear ; Procalcitonin &gt; 0.25 µg/mL ; Plus least 2 follow : Respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation ; New onset expectorate suctioned purulent sputum production respiratory secretion , change character sputum ; Auscultatory finding pulmonary examination rale and/or evidence pulmonary consolidation ; Dyspnea , tachypnea , sign respiratory distress evidence increase respiratory support oxygen requirement , particularly progressive nature ; Hypoxemia pulse oximetry arterial blood gas require increase supplemental oxygen ; 4 . Has chest Xray new consolidation consistent pneumonia significant worsen previous finding consistent pneumonia ; 5 . Has Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation II ( APACHE II ) score ≥ 8 ≤ 30 Screening Visit . Participants meet follow exclusion criterion enrol study : 1 . Has requirement inhale nonstudy antibiotic ; 2 . Has treat inhale antibiotic ( include inhale aminoglycosides ) within 72 hour study entry ; 3 . Has renal insufficiency Screening evidence estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min base CockcroftGault formula ; 4 . Is risk rapidly fatal illness death within next 72 hour ; 5 . Is pregnant nurse female . Females childbearing potential must serum pregnancy test prior enrollment . If result serum pregnancy test available prior Day 1 Treatment Visit , patient may enrol basis negative urine pregnancy test ; however , result serum pregnancy test must still obtain . If either test positive , patient must exclude ; 6 . Has myasthenia gravis , parkinsonism , progressive neuromuscular disorder ; 7 . Has history epilepsy know seizure disorder ; 8 . Has history sensorineural hearing loss result therapy know ototoxic ( eg , aminoglycosides , cisplatin , loop diuretic , quinine ) ; 9 . Has receive investigational medication last 30 day ( 5 halflives investigational medication , whichever long ) prior Screening Visit ; 10 . Has know hypersensitivity ME1100 , aminoglycosides , specify Best Available Therapy agents excipients .</criteria>
