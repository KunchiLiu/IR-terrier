	<detailed_description>Gross underfeeding iatrogenic malnutrition prevalent intensive care unit throughout world . Critically ill patient receive , average , 40-50 % prescribed nutritional requirement . Inadequate provision nutrition patient associate increased complication , prolong length stay ICU hospital , increased mortality . There good data large scale observational study randomize trial suggest good fed patient well clinical economic outcome ICUs consistently reach average 80-90 % nutritional adequacy ( amount nutrition receive amount prescribe ) thus appear feasible goal . The PEP uP protocol ( Enhanced Protein-Energy Provision via Enteral Route Feeding Protocol ) include new , innovative approach protocolizes aggressive set strategy provide enteral nutrition ( EN ) shift paradigm reactionary proactive follow de-escalation nutrition therapy need . The key component new PEP uP protocol following : 1 . Starting feed target rate base increase evidence patient tolerate start nutrition high rate delivery slow start ups necessary . 2 . Allowing `` trophic feed '' low volume concentrate feeding solution 24 hour longer , design maintain gastrointestinal structure function patient deem unsuitable high volume intragastric feed . 3 . Prescribing semi-elemental feeding solution instead standard polymeric solution . These change traditional polymeric solution patient tolerate adequate amount nutrition . 4 . Prescribing protein supplement initiation EN discontinue EN well tolerate protein requirement meet standard EN . 5 . Starting motility agent time EN start re-evaluation day follow see necessary . This PEP uP protocol previously study two publish study enrol primarily medical patient . In first study , pilot trial , protocol seem feasible , safe , acceptable critical care nurse . No incident compromise patient safety observe . ( Heyland 2010 ) Rates vomit , regurgitation , aspiration , pneumonia similar PEP uP group receive significantly energy protein ( prescribed receive full volume oppose `` trophic '' ) . A subsequent multi-center cluster randomize trial involve low-performing ICUs likewise demonstrate intervention site improvement energy protein delivery well decrease average time ICU admission start enteral nutrition compare control group . ( Heyland 2013 ) .</detailed_description>
