	<detailed_description>Psychotic disorder schizophrenia ( SZ ) among disable condition medicine . These disorder typically begin adolescence young adulthood , precede premorbid impairment cognitive social function date early childhood ; deficit worsen adolescence accompany sub-threshold positive negative symptom ( prodromal , clinical high risk state , CHR ) onset first psychotic episode . Recent stag model operationalized approach define early late phase CHR ; Early CHR ( stage 1a ) characterize cognitive impairment sub-threshold negative symptom , late CHR ( stage 1b ) associate sub-threshold positive disorganize symptom well cognitive functional decline . The emergence cognitive functional decline Individuals CHR convert psychosis highlight importance early intervention . Impairments cognition present child later go develop SZ . Impairments cognition key rate-limiting factor functional recovery psychotic disorder include deficit psychomotor speed , memory , attention , reason , social cognition . The latter include deficit perspective-taking , emotion perception regulation , clearly link functional outcome SZ . Perspective-taking ( ability understand thought , feeling , intention others ) emotion regulation ( ability cognitive control emotional stimulus ) critical healthy social development ; impairment major contributor social functional disability . There compel evidence recent meta-analyses psychosocial approach cognitive remediation effective SZ . We show psychosocial cognitive rehabilitation know Cognitive Enhancement Therapy ( CET ) substantially improve social cognition employment rate among patient early course SZ . The effect durable 1 year follow end treatment . CET comprehensive , developmental approach address social non-social cognitive deficit SZ ; seek facilitate development adult social-cognitive milestone ( e.g. , perspective-taking , social context appraisal ) shift think reliance effortful , serial processing `` gistful '' spontaneous abstraction social theme ( detail CET section C.2.6 ) . CET target social-cognitive impairment perspective-taking emotion regulation computerize training basic neurocognitive process , use social-cognitive rehabilitation group . The efficacy CET remediate social-cognitive impairment perspective-taking emotion regulation SZ presumably reflect underlying change fronto-temporal brain function connectivity course treatment , make possible plasticity human brain . CET may also protect gray matter loss , even support fronto-temporal gray matter growth service social-cognitive enhancement SZ . In study , plan modify CET individual CHR . We develop manual CLUES systematically test acceptability , tolerability , adherence preliminary proof target engagement ( part 1 ) , preliminary efficacy proof concept open label trial ( part 2 ) . An important recent initiative treatment development ensure inform , data-driven decision early clinical trial , i.e . identify therapeutic target , obtain evidence target engagement proof concept efficacy prior proceed expensive clinical trial . To pursue goal , evaluate CET effect cognition social cognition part 1 efficacy test part 2 . Overview : This study organize two part : Part 1 : Preliminary open-label CLUES group ( n=8 ) verify target engagement ( use cognition social cognition measure ) , evaluate feasibility tolerability , iteratively refine manual . Part 2 : Small , randomize trial compare CLUES ( 2 group , n=15 control condition ( psychotherapy + active computer-based program , Sporcle , simple/ non-demanding computer game ) .CLUES Interventions part optimize base part 1 result . Interventions : 1 ) Individualized assessment : The intervention begin comprehensive assessment neurocognition social cognition , well cognitive style . This inform development individualize coaching plan target individual 's area difficulty . The individualized coaching plan set CET apart standardize cognitive remediation approach . 2 ) Neurocognitive remediation session . Weekly CET cognitive remediation session involve work partner ( peer ) facilitate clinician . This provide unique opportunity participant complete `` bottom '' cognitive exercise design improve process speed , attention , memory problem solve also learn negotiate social task involve work partner ( e.g. , make appropriate small talk , pay attention keep score partner engage task , provide encouragement partner struggle , and/or manage feeling come participant struggle partner ) . 3 ) Social cognitive group : Participants take part weekly social cognitive group concurrently neurocognitive train individual session . This group design help participant learn strategy apply skill improve non-social social cognition provide vivo learn experience foster development social wisdom interpersonal success . A broad , theoretically-driven array social-cognitive ability target social cognitive group , range abstract `` gist '' main point social interaction perspective take , social context appraisal , emotion management . Participants actively engage social cognitive group respond unrehearsed social exchange , present homework , participate cognitive exercise focus experiential learning , provide feedback peer , chair homework session . 4 ) Individual coaching : Weekly individual coaching session provide opportunity intervention tailor participant ' specific goal , cognitive difficulty cognitive style . Coaching session help participant develop training plan , digest information skill learn social cognitive group neurocognitive training session , figure apply make progress toward personal goal . Control treatment ( Part 2 ) : During part 1 , participant take part CLUES . During part 2 , conduct small randomize trial participant randomize CLUES control intervention ( n=15 ) . The control intervention consist weekly supportive personal therapy plus 2 hours/ week participation Sporcle , web-based , publicly available active computer-based , generic , quiz-type program . Sporcle provide quiz subject area geography basic arithmetic pop-culture . Sporcle include game identify popular logo , name many picture fruit vegetable possible , list state capitol . Based online user data level difficulty , relatively easy exercise choose ( average approximately 70 % accuracy ( i.e . 70 % quiz item correctly answer , average ) . Games present participant `` prescription card '' week , aim participate 2 hour per week ( equivalent 1 hour lumosity plus 1 hour per week pair computer training . In ST , patient meet individually therapist learn practice variety stress-reduction illness management technique . The ST approach design sensitive patient 's stage development divide 2 phase . The first , basic phase ( 0-3 month ) focus psychoeducation risk psychosis ( developed phase 1 ) , role stress disorder , symptom exacerbation , introduces basic cop strategy minimize and/or avoid stress one 's life.The second , phase ( 4-6 month ) advance personalize approach identification early cue distress application healthy cop strategy enhance adjustment . By tailor treatment patient 's stage recovery , Patients meet weekly therapist , although frequent session available need . We seek match number session hour treatment CLUES ST . Participants assess : 1 ) Baseline , 2 ) 3 month program , 3 ) time completion program ( 6 month ) , 4 ) 3 month follow completion CLUES , part 2 trial ( Table 1 ) . All assessment administer part 1 ass acceptability , applicability CHR population assessment burden ; Observations use optimize assessment battery part 2 .</detailed_description>
