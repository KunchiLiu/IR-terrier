	<brief_summary>Children low executive function , work memory attention skill childhood poorly school , also go poorly social , health , financial indicator adulthood . The rate executive function disorder child vastly underestimate 17 % , even take account two widely know disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( 11 % ) Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders ( 6 % ) , child low socioeconomic status especially vulnerable due reduce resource availability . As executive function , work memory attention skills central success later life , child low skill give target train improve skill fall short , potential improve short-term academic performance , influence long-term achievement . In fact , poor executive function skill poor attention work memory large predictor poor performance even typically develop child poorly academically . Hypothesis 1 . Those low work memory also low problem solve skill low index executive function skill reasoning/problem solve . Hypothesis 2 . Children start low WM PS show high gain train related performance , high gain WM PS lead good performance post-intervention compare baseline measure cognitive function . Hypothesis 3 : Those make large gain WM PS training show retention training gain 6 month compare show low gain . Aim 1 . Assess work memory ( WM ) process speed ( PS ) skills child inter-relationships executive functioning skill Aim 2 . Examine change cognitive function WM PS intensive training WM PS , immediately post-intervention Aim 3 . Examine long-term retention training effect WM , PS , executive function . The purpose study establish effective targeted work memory process speed intervention child age 7-10 low average executive function skill , utilize home-based computer game specifically design appeal child . Following institution approve consent , 60 low socioeconomic status child Los Angeles recruit enrol study ask play specific fun , target cognitive computer game 10 week . The result pilot study establish protocol feasibility improve executive function skill child underdevelop skill inform sufficiency sample size , length intervention , directly impact computer-based intervention research cost-effective technique child 's cognitive development within next 3-5 year .</brief_summary>
