	<brief_title>Unilateral Nerve-Sparing Cryoablation Low-Risk , Clinically Localized , Unilateral Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study clinical trial determine assess change rate potency men low-risk , localize , unilateral prostate cancer receive previous treatment . A total 86 men 40 69 year age biopsy proven , early stage localize prostate cancer receive unilateral nerve-sparing cryoablation . The study include screening/pre-operative visit , cryoablation procedure day , 10 follow visit course 36 month . The first follow-up visit occur within 2 week ( ±1 week ) cryoablation . Thereafter , follow-up visit schedule , date procedure , every 3 month ( ±3 week ) 18 month every 6 month ( ±3 week ) thereafter patient completes protocol , 36 month cryoablation procedure .</detailed_description>
