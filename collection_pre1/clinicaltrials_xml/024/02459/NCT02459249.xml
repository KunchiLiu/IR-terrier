	<detailed_description>The objective study evaluate effect low-cost healthy-habits intervention tailor cultural , economical social context target population cardiometabolic parameter , population access specialize health service . The intervention design consider environmental economic context like availability food physical activity space ; cultural factor like social culinary tradition ; individual food preference . It encompass select set behavioral nutritional strategy aim achieve control metabolic disorder involve reduce risk diabetes . MATERIAL AND METHODS : The investigator ' study nine-month clinical intervention randomize allocation , parallel assignment . For first six month , participant control group receive treatment primary care service Health Minister ( Treatment protocols component metabolic syndrome ) implement local health center , intervention group participant receive treatment improve quality diet promote practice physical activity . Both group reevaluate third , sixth ninth-months follow-up . The physician nutritionist study give recommendation diet advice exercise , mainly suggest moderate-intensity activity , brisk walk least 150 minutes/week . For diagnosis MS , investigator use classification International Diabetes Federation , therefore participant require three follow criterion : ) waist circumference ≥ 90 cm men ≥ 80 cm woman , b ) triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL , c ) high density lipoprotein ( HDL-cholesterol ) &lt; 40 mg/dL men &lt; 50 mg/dL woman , ) blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg ; e ) fast glucose ≥100 mg/dL . Sample Size . Power size estimate assume 2-sided t-test alpha 0.05 power 80 % . Data estimation ( standard deviation , expect mean difference indicator ) take previous study similar population . The investigator expect difference prevalence MS component least 10 prevalence point , ( −5 % control , −10 % intervention group ) . The sample size 60 person per experimental condition ( total = 120 ) . Recruitment : The study conduct rural county central Mexico . Individuals invited participate screening MS post public area use traditional social network . During screening , individual interested participate receive explanation study . Upon agreement train standardized personnel take medical history , anthropometric measurement ( weight , height , waist circumference ) blood pressure venous blood sample determination glucose , triglyceride , HDL-cholesterol . The first 120 candidate accept study . In addition criterion already mention , investigator record address candidate , investigator identify two live household . Randomization Participants randomly allocate matched pair . The variable match : in-house social support ( whether another person interested changing lifestyle household ) , level self-efficacy follow structure diet . Then , within match pair , investigator randomly allocate treatment condition . Study Procedures : The intervention group receive general information physician study , emphasize importance healthy lifestyle . Verbal write individualized recommendation train professional ( nutritionist , physician ) provide . From first month six month , monthly session least 30 minute cover diet , exercise , behavior modification hold . The first one-to-one meeting follow group session base behavioral counseling ( Explanations benefit diet exercise control metabolic abnormality ) healthy habit tip During session , individually prescribed diet give , line exist guideline . Similarly , advice exercise give , mainly suggest moderate-intensity activity , brisk walk least 150 minutes/week . The control group treatment primary care service receive specific individualized program . Both group reevaluate zero , three six month follow-up . Intervention Development : The intervention psychologically base transtheoretical model change theory self-regulation . A review evidence-based practice short long-term weight loss also perform , yield similar conclusion professional review panel . The psychological process investigator aim influence intervention : social support , feedback self-monitoring , counterconditioning , goal setting , stimulus control . For process , investigator develop intervention component . The development component base iterative methodology human-centered approach , describe detail another paper . The development intervention component do use design think approach . Through iterative process mixed development prototype collection data regard context target population , researcher progressively refine investigator ' intervention component . Structured diet . Starting physiologically base model , investigator develop multiple prototype , aim satisfy nutritional requirement also population constrains , food cost , availability skill . Finally , investigator adapt menu culinary tradition target population . Skills Workshops . Formative research yield important food behavior necessary work process food skill , cook skill social support skill . Goal set . A commitment contract provide . participant . They invite define monthly goal term health parameter appearance ( fit slim ) , accordance clinical plan These contract significant others small reward . The requirement goal approve clinician contract promote adherence treatment . Feedback component . A food journaling tool provide participant . They invite follow food physical activity journal , along weight measurement daily every day . For participant low literacy level , investigator provide plate container help measurement . In addition , result physiological test provide right away , know far goal . Stimuli Control . A workshop regard reshape food environment home work give , adherence lifestyle change becomes easy . Household social-support : workshop aim improve participant ability negotiate social support provide . They encourage obtain `` partner lifestyle physical appearance challenge '' household . This partner able assist workshop consultation main participant . Analysis . To evaluate effect intervention , investigator utilize structural causal model ( SCM ) . The target causal parameter interest effect intervention prevalence MS component , average treatment effect experimental intervention . The investigator commit use estimate base G-comp formula . The investigator assess positivity assumption prior analysis adjust practical violation . The investigator test different estimation method target estimate ( ATE ) , include parametric non-parametric . The investigator use preestablished set method criterion choose among ( likely lossless function ) . This method , call super learner , describe detail ( Van der Laan , Petersen ) . The investigator estimate average treatment effect ( ATE ) conditional treatment effect ( cTE ) . Ethical approval . The study conduct approval Ethics Research Committees National Institute Public Health , Mexico .</detailed_description>
