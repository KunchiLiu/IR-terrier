	<detailed_description>This study two phase : Phase 1 : Formative research Phase 2 : Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) . The purpose formative research phase develop culturally adapt intervention ( CAI ) program improve weight physical activity overweight obese adult Latinos high risk develop type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The purpose RCT rigorously evaluate effectiveness implementation potential CAI program . The propose intervention uniquely adapt coach-led , technology-supported Group Lifestyle Balance ( GLB ) program investigator prove effective investigator ' prior trial call E-LITE , provide culturally linguistically appropriate lifestyle intervention weight loss increase physical activity among high-risk Latinos primary care . The CAI deliver small group well use exist , rapidly expand internet mobile technology ( Website , email , mobile text messaging ) . Once developed investigator subject CAI rigorous evaluation RCT 186 eligible consent Latinos . The investigator hypothesize CAI participant achieve great mean reduction body mass index ( BMI ) baseline 24 month ( primary outcome ) usual care control . Secondary outcome include measure cardiometabolic risk factor ( e.g. , low fast glucose lipid level ) , psychosocial well-being ( e.g. , improve mood ) , behavior change ( e.g. , increased physical activity ) . The overarch research goal determine effectiveness implementation potential CAI base Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ( RE-AIM ) framework .</detailed_description>
