	<brief_summary>This prospective registry evaluate safety perform magnetic resonance ( MRI ) scan patient cardiac implant electronic device ( CIEDs ) . This include pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICDs ) . This new device approval new MRI scanner approval , registry patient need MRI scan already FDA approve CIED currently label use conjunction MRI scan . This registry similar previously approve MagnaSafe Registry close new enrollment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Magnetic Resonance Imaging Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Registry investigator initiate project design follow footstep MagnaSafe Registry . MagaSafe initiate determine risk perform MRI patient pacemaker Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators ( ICDs ) . The latter close new enrollment April 2014 ; however , still need accumulate data device . There also significant clinical need , patient insured CMS currently exclude MRI scan pacemaker ICD . The option available undergo removal entire system , MRI scan , new system implant . This impossible many patient `` pacemaker dependent '' . It also expose patient well-known risk complication removal/extraction process well re-implant procedure . This must contrast negligible risk MRI scan device place ( assume proper precaution take ) , base MagaSafe data well large body support literature . Magnetic resonance image modality choice diagnosis many disease brain , spinal cord , musculoskeletal system . For disease state , acceptable alternative diagnostic imaging method available . MRI superior image diagnostic modality many disorder , also expose patient ionize radiation CT . The number patient live permanent pacemaker ICDs well million ( estimate 4 million US ) , continue increase . Likewise , use MRI continue rise annually patient group , however , people advance age , likely need MRI scan . As device population disproportionally weight towards old population , exactly group great need MRI scan , yet may deny . As noted MagnaSafe information , `` To provide optimal care increase number patient implanted cardiac device , health care professional must capability perform MR image minimal risk full knowledge possible complication . '' This registry recreate protocol , safety monitoring follow manner similar registry . The intent provide data hopefully continue support use MRI scanning device patient , allow essential imaging technique available patient without need expose 2 otherwise unnecessary procedure removal replacement implant device . This physician institutional base registry start New York University Langone Medical Center collaboration Division Cardiology ( Electrophysiology Section ) Department Radiology ( MRI image section ) . It anticipate additional site may join registry time , FDA permit . The protocol base widely publish `` Hopkins protocol '' attach submission . Several thousand patient safely scan use technique emphasize patient safety . Patients monitor experienced device personnel ( ACLS certify ) vital sign ( non-invasive blood pressure monitoring , pulse oximeter , cardiac rhythm monitor ( EKG ) ) perform scans patient implanted device . Scans do major medical center equip manage device heart rhythm base complication one occur . Only patient image technique provide adequate information allow scan . The latter must attest physician require information , agree upon electrophysiologist radiologist . IRB approval write investigator agreement require center may eventually participate registry .</detailed_description>
