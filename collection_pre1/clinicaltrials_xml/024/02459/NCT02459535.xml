Recent study animal human show , artificial sweetener ( AS ) influence metabolic response glucose ingestion , possibly alter intestinal microbiome even modulate incretin release . However , unclear , finding valid kind AS , chemically different . Furthermore , data human subject sparse controversial .

	<detailed_description>Epidemiological data suggest , sugar-based , also artificially sweeten soft drink may play role development diabetes . Recent study animal human show , artificial sweetener ( AS ) influence metabolic response glucose ingestion , possibly alter intestinal microbiome even modulate incretin release . However , unclear , finding valid kind AS , chemically different . Up , single study ever compare metabolic response different AS subject . Furthermore , data human subject sparse controversial . This partially explain different methodical approach intragastral/intraduodenal application AS , rather conventional oral consumption . The investigator therefore conduct 7 consecutive single oral stimulation glucose AS alone combination . Three different AS test : saccharin , aspartame sucralose .</detailed_description>
