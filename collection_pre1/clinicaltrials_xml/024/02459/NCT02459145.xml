	<detailed_description>Concussion refer mild form traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) result temporary loss consciousness , memory , awareness . mTBI also cause physiologic symptom nausea vomiting , headache , vestibulo-ocular dysfunction , balance error . The majority individual mTBI fully recover within 7-10 day period , although adolescent may require time recover adult . The American Medical Society Sports Medicine ( AMSSM ) position statement concussion management indicate standardize guideline return school return play recommendation involve graduated activity program symptom resolve . [ 1 ] Treatment varies amongst physician , widely hold minimum 5 day strict rest home ( specifically , school , work , physical activity ) follow stepwise return activity . Recent article , however question validity strict rest many day similar injury ( whiplash ) recommendation involve attempt gradually resume normal activity daily live . [ 2 ] Individuals whose concussion symptom resolve within 7-10 day consider post concussion syndrome ( PCS ) ill-defined poorly understood , however AMSSM describe benefit supervise progressive exercise program increase tolerance symptom permit . The protocols literature adult involve assess maximum threshold symptom exacerbate individual perform supervise exercise 80 % rate , [ 3 , 4 ] however do pediatric population pediatric physician instead perform graduated activity protocol start low threshold increase unless exacerbation occurs ( SORT Level Evidence C ) . [ 5 , 6 ] It propose fundamental cause PCS physiological dysfunction fail return normal concussion . Essentially patient concussion state sympathetic nervous system predominance . This result subsequent alter autonomic function impair cerebral auto regulation . [ 7 ] Aerobic exercise training may help concussion-related physiological dysfunction exercise increase parasympathetic activity , reduce sympathetic activation , improve cerebral blood flow . Recent article compare rest activity find slow recovery PCS rest group . [ 8 ] The aim research provide documentation literature adolescent graduate activity protocol currently practice University Arizona Pediatric Sports Medicine Clinic .</detailed_description>
