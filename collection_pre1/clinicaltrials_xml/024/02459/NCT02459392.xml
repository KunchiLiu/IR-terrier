	<brief_title>EuroPainClinicsÂ® Study II ( Prospective Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A small flexible fibreoptic catheter insert sacral hiatus area concern visualize screen . Effective drug like active enzyme : Hyaluronic acid corticosteroid inject catheter . With method eliminate adhesion scar tissue may pull irritate specific nerve root . Indicated procedure patient low back pain sciatic patient successful result back surgery spine surgery experience continue pain surgery : Failed back surgery syndrome ( FBSS ) . Trial compare group patient fulfilment inclusion Failed back surgery syndrome undergo interventional pain release procedure epiduroscopy . Elimination adhesion , scar tissue provide mechanically ( grabber , balloon technique , radiofrequency laser ) medical support ( Hyaluronic acid Depo-Medrol administration via epidural catheter ) . The first group patient enrol trial undergo mechanical lysis epidural adhesion ( grabber , balloon technique , radiofrequency laser ) . The second group patient enrol trial undergo mechanical lysis epidural adhesion together epidural drug administration ( Hyaluronic acid 150 IU Depo-Medrol 80mg ) . After first visit ambulance patient study inform . After agreement patient study involve . Specific unique nine digit number assign patient . Then patient randomize group special evaluate software create especially study . Patients agree range epiduroscopy ( mechanical combination mechanical drug administration ) inform end study . This way patient blind . Second examination provide 6 month . Patients begin introduced doctor unique number . Doctor blind dispose information microinvasive procedure examine patient . Data collect : ( Visual analogue scale , dermatome pain radiating , global pain scale , change analgesics drug consumption ) . All acquire information note special anonymous protocol . Also patient anonymously fulfill Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire . The third examination provide 12 month way . Patients begin introduced doctor unique number . Doctor blind dispose information microinvasive procedure examine patient . Data collect : ( Visual analogue scale , pain radiate dermatome , global pain scale , change analgesics drug consumption ) . All acquire information note special anonymous protocol . Also patient anonymously fulfill Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire .</detailed_description>
