	<brief_title>A Dose-Ranging Study IPH2201 Patients With Gynecologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research do treatment cure type cancer . Although type chemotherapy may cause cancer shrink time , good option need . In laboratory test animal , IPH2201 show effect result shrinkage tumour . IPH2201 study people rheumatoid arthritis yet study people cancer investigator know offer good result standard treatment . The standard usual treatment disease could include surgery , chemotherapy radiation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients must histologically and/or cytologically confirm gynecologic malignancy include highgrade serous ovarian/fallopian tube peritoneal carcinoma , cervical cancer ( squamous cell carcinoma ) endometrial cancer ( adenocarcinoma ) , advanced/metastatic/recurrent unresectable curative therapy exists . For patient HGSC : For Part 2 study , patient classify either platinum resistant platinum sensitive , define previous response platinumbased therapy : The platinum resistant cohort include patient disease progression within 6 month last line platinumbased therapy dose . The platinum sensitive cohort define progression 6 month long since last platinumbased therapy dose . All patient must available formalin fix paraffin embed tissue block ( primary metastatic tumour ) must provide informed consent release block ( slide ) , well sample correlative study bank . • At least 4 patient register cohort Part 2 must also provide informed consent willing undergo tumour biopsy prior treatment ( registration ) treatment IPH2201 . Note : During accrual Part 2 , may necessary restrict accrual patient suitable , consent , tumour biopsy treatment . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior randomization/registration ( within 35 day negative ) . All patient must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 . The criterion define measurable disease follow : Chest xray ≥ 20 mm CT scan ( slice thickness 5 mm ) ≥ 10 mm &gt; long diameter Physical exam ( use caliper ) ≥ 10 mm Lymph node CT scan ≥ 15 mm &gt; measure short axis Patients must ≥ 18 year age . Patients must ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Previous Therapy Cytotoxic Chemotherapy : All patient must receive least one prior regimen chemotherapy advance , metastatic , recurrent disease , one must platinumbased . Patients may receive 3 prior regimen . Other systemic therapy : All patient may receive therapy include immunotherapy , angiogenesis inhibitor , PARP inhibitor signal transduction inhibitor . Patients must recover reversible toxicity relate prior chemotherapy systemic therapy adequate washout follow : Longest one follow : Two week 5 half life investigational agent Standard cycle length standard therapy Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse last dose radiation date randomization/registration . Exceptions may make lowdose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation NCIC CTG . Surgery : Previous surgery permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse major surgery date randomization/registration , wound heal occur . Patients must recover treatment related toxicity prior randomization/registration ( unless grade 1 , irreversible , consider investigator clinically significant ) . Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 x ULN ; ≤ 5.0 x UNL patient know liver metastasis Women childbearing potential must agree use highly effective contraceptive method study 5 month last dose IPH2201 . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior randomization/registration trial prior test consider study specific document willingness participate . Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , response assessment , adverse event , followup . In accordance CCTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient randomization ( Part 1 ) registration ( Part 2 ) . Patients history active current malignancy require active treatment . Patients serious illness medical condition might aggravate treatment limit compliance include , limited : History significant neurologic psychiatric disorder would impair ability obtain consent limit compliance study requirement . Uncontrolled diabetes Active uncontrolled serious infection ( viral , bacterial fungal ) Other medical condition might aggravate study treatment Patients active immunemediated disease know HIV infection hepatitis B C. Patients receive systemic corticosteroid therapy dose equivalent 5 mg prednisone . Note : Topical application ( e.g . rash ) , inhale spray ( e.g . obstructive airway disease ) , eye drop local injection ( e.g . intraarticular ) permit . Patients receive cytokine and/or growth factor . Patients experience severe adverse effect immunotherapybased treatment monoclonal antibody . Patients receive concurrent treatment anticancer therapy investigational agent .</criteria>
