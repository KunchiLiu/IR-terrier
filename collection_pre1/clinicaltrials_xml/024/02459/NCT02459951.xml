	<brief_summary>Relevant patient spastic hemiparesis hand upper limb , pilot project propose measure effect botulinum toxin injection observation performance functional task know 'hand holder ' . This task require person hemiplegia insert object affect hand hold independently . The project aim demonstrate reliability validity digital video method use measure 'insertion time ' . It also aim establish initial statistical support improve object insertion time hemiplegic clench fist Botox A injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Holding Function Hemiplegic Hand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Holding everyday hand function , object enter hand radially , frontally , ulnarly in-between finger space . After stroke , hand person hemiplegia typically lack voluntary finger extension open hand . Simultaneously , hand also subject involuntary contraction finger flexor muscle close hand , result clenched fist thumb-in-palm deformity . Despite typical hemiplegic configuration , person stroke may able insert object hand wiggle push hemiplegic hand uninvolved hand , though struggle often present failure frequent . In hemiplegic patient , common driver clench fist thumb-in-palm configuration excessive involuntary neural activation finger thumb flexor , compound impaired absent voluntary finger extension . Excessive finger thumb flexor contraction variously ascribe involuntary phenomenon spasticity , spastic dystonia , co-contraction , associate reaction others . For investigator purpose , involuntary phenomenon generate contractile tension hand thumb muscle choke hand 's potential function holder object describe . The underlying rationale project examine whether hemiplegic 'hand holder ' function improve weakening involuntary muscle contraction generate clench fist thumb palm use neuromuscular block property Botox A . The investigator hypothesize 'hand holder ' function improve chemodenervation relevant finger , thumb wrist muscle select clinical examination . Nine subject enrol . Baseline observation make two occasion prior Botox A injection outcomes measure four week later . A digital video method use measure 'insertion time ' all-time point . Given importance relationship `` statistically significant '' research result `` clinically significant '' , person-oriented , functional improvement , investigator also hypothesize experienced clinician independently rate performance object insertion clench fist globally good chemodenervation .</detailed_description>
