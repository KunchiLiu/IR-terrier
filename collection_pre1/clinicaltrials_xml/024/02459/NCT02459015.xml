	<brief_title>Performance Study Artificial Nerve Guide ( Reaxon® Nerve Guide ) Treat Digital Nerve Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical investigation NG-001 multicenter , parallel , control , randomize , blind evaluation repair digital nerve lesion . Medovent perform clinical investigation post-market clinical follow-up ( PMCF ) study accordance MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev2 guideline confirm medium- long-term safety performance chitosan-based nerve guide ( Reaxon® Nerve Guide ) . The result investigation use Medovent update clinical evaluation throughout life-cycle Reaxon® Nerve Guide ensure long term safety performance market . Additionally , Medovent include application Reaxon® Nerve Guide digital nerve confirm safety apply Reaxon® Nerve Guide joint . The study perform specialized German center . A total number 76 subject traumatic digital nerve injury surgical repair may allow end-to-end direct suture nerve end , nerve tissue gap would indicate use autograft equal le 26 mm , eligible inclusion . The primary objective clinical investigation demonstrate static 2-point discrimination ( 2-PD ) 12 month surgery inferior Reaxon® Nerve Guide test group compare control group receive autologous nerve graft . The secondary objective document long-term effect ( 18 month surgery ) nerve repair . The non-inferiority test demonstrate exclude treatment difference large 20 % favor control group .</detailed_description>
