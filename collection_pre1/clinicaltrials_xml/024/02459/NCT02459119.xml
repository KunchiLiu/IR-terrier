	<brief_title>Study Regorafenib Urothelial Cancer Following Chemotherapy ( UAB 1477 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) poor long-term prognosis . The disease see improve outcome despite research effort two decade . Novel therapeutic option need . Regorafenib novel oral multikinase inhibitor potent similar multikinase inhibitor drug treat advance renal cell carcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma . Regorafenib show broad capacity inhibit blood supply tumor source . This trial evaluate proof-of-concept use Regorafenib patient metastatic progressive urothelial carcinoma follow chemotherapy still high level activity performance daily live . The initial dose Regorafenib 120 mg daily escalate 160 mg daily gradually taper .</detailed_description>
