	<brief_summary>This study do determine whether cooled radiofrequency ablation ( CRFA ) medial branch nerve lumbar facet joint effective treatment low back pain . CRFA block nerve carry pain signal joint low back brain receive message low back pain . This technique commonly perform burn nerve rather freeze , suspect freezing result well pain relief . The CRFA block show effectively treat sacroiliac joint pain ( joint pelvis ) , another reason suspect CRFA effective treat pain related facet joint low back . We perform study order determine case .</brief_summary>
