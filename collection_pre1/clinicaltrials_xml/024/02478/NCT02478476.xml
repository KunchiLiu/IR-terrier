	<brief_summary>The presence single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene involve platinum taxane metabolism detoxification correlate increase risk severe adverse event ( AEs ) patient receive drug . The investigator propose study validate comprehensive panel twelve SNPs ovarian cancer patient may predict AEs treated therapy include platinum taxanes . Using result stratify patient different dose regimen , route administration , recurrent cancer aid drug selection , may improve outcome reduce cost management drug relate side effect change standard care . Since difference detect blood , determination genotype do use standard blood sample take ovarian cancer confirm patient 's pathology report . These genetic difference detect QPCR Next Generation Sequencing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The majority ovarian cancer patient treat combination platinum- taxane-based chemotherapy . While initial response rate high ( &gt; 90 % ) , patient experience severe AEs lead discontinuation therapy . However , GOG paclitaxel package insert include treatment guideline involve decrease dose regimen AEs encounter [ 1 , 2 ] . The clinical validation genetic difference gene biomarkers severe AEs would allow treat physician alter dosing , thus increase time patient could remain drug decrease side effect unnecessary morbidity . Another clinical utility genetic difference ovarian cancer patient care identification patient may benefit intraperitoneal ( IP ) chemotherapy dose dense chemotherapy . While IP chemotherapy show improve patient outcome , side effect much frequent severe due high dose [ 3 ] . Testing patient prior treatment predictive genotype may factor doctor 's decision forego IP chemotherapy favor standard intravenous delivery . Dose dense chemotherapy demonstrate improvement outcome also increase side effect [ 4 , 5 ] . In therapy regimen , ability stratify patient base risk toxicity associate treatment may lead great benefit IP dose dense therapy minimize side effect associate health care cost . Previous study ovarian cancer demonstrate expression protein ERCC1 , GST , p53 affect response platinum base therapy ovarian cancer patient [ 6-13 ] . When SNPs gene encode protein evaluate , correlation AEs response platinum-based therapy make [ 14 , 15 ] . Mutations affect activity ERCC1 associate nephrotoxicity . Mutations GST family member associate neutropenia ( GSTA1 ) , neuropathy ( GSTM3 GSTP1 ) , anemia thrombocytopenia ( GSTM3 ) . Mutations p53 associate neutropenia . In study , mutation XPD XRCC1 also find predictive neutropenia ( XPD XRCC1 ) anemia ( XPD ) . More recently , study do Scottish Gynecological Clinical Trials Group identify SNPs BCL2 , Current Version Date : 04/01/15 Previous Version Date : N/A , Initial version Page 6 23 OPRM1 SOX10 TRPV1 associate neurotoxicity [ 16 ] . Both individual combine value biomarkers need assess . Reviewing study do tumor type identify SNPs associated toxicity may also applicable ovarian cancer . In breast cancer , SNPs CYP2C8 , CYP17A1 , ABCG1 gene associate increase risk grade 2+ peripheral neuropathy patient treat taxane-based therapy . [ 17 , 18 ] . A different SNP CYP17A1 ( rs619824 ) also previously report associated bortezomib-induced neuropathy multiple myeloma patient , potentially support role protein onset neuropathy [ 19 ] . Since SNPs germ line difference , reason believe may valuable biomarkers ovarian cancer also . In multiple myeloma , suggest identification closer monitoring patient risk neuropathy could beneficial [ 20 ] . A similar strategy could use ovarian cancer patient reduce severe toxicity result discontinuation effective drug . The detection polymorphisms QPCR confirm direct sequencing cell line tumor tissue . The protocol test research lab validate CLIA regulate lab formalin fix paraffin embed sample blood . In brief , DNA purify spin column , quantitated , mixed specific SNP assay Master Mix ( Life Technologies ) . Results analyzed Life Technologies TaqMan Genotyper software version 1.3 determine genotype . The SNPs detect blood sample collect ovarian cancer patient FFPE ovarian cancer specimens similar frequency report paper reference . SNPs tumor type detect blood sample ovarian cancer patient FFPE ovarian cancer specimens well blood FFPE sample endometrial cancer patient .</detailed_description>
