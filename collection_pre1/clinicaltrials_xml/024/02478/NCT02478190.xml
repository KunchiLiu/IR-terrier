	<brief_title>ED Management Severe Hyperglycemia : A Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It common practice provide insulin and/or intravenous ( IV ) fluid low glucose level prior discharge patient present hyperglycemia . There , however , data support practice . A recent retrospective observational cohort study ( HSR # 12-3497 ) 567 ED patient severe hyperglycemia demonstrate association discharge glucose level short-term adverse outcome 7 day ( return ED visit , diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) , hospitalization , death ) . There short-term adverse outcome associate degree glycemic control . Less 1 % patient develop DKA 7 day . No patient die . As retrospective study , conclusion draw limited lack randomization control ; necessary conduct randomize control trial quantify much time expend care patient , gather safety data . This important much time money focus glucose reduction , may change short-term outcome . Furthermore , retrospective analysis approximately 1.5 % patient receive therapy hyperglycemia develop iatrogenic hypoglycemia ED stay . To detect difference length stay 60 minute ( Standard deviation 100 minute ) p=0.05 b=0.8 , enrollment 45 patient per group require , total enrollment 90 patient . Enrollment stop 45 patient group contact follow-up . This study include patient discharge ED . Patients enrol eventually admit hospital tabulate excluded length stay analysis . Statistical analysis complete primary outcome Mann-Whitney U test , assume data normally distribute . Secondary outcome compare chi-squared testing . A secondary regression model form , base covariates could influence ED length stay , amount diagnostic testing complete .</detailed_description>
