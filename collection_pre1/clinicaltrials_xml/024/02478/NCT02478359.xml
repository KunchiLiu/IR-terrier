	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) third lead cause death US . The personal , social economic cost disease tremendous , annual expenditure nearly $ 50 billion , mostly hospitalization exacerbation COPD associate sequela . For vast majority patient , despite optimal pharmacological therapy , live COPD characterize unrelieved dyspnea , physical inactivity , deconditioning , insidious downward spiral social isolation depression profound impact live patient caregiver . There mount evidence physical inactivity significantly associate frequent hospitalization increase mortality COPD even adjust disease severity . While practice guideline recommend regular physical activity patient COPD , health system challenge operationalizing effective sustainable approach assist patient physically active . The investigator propose pragmatic randomize control trial determine effectiveness 12-month physical activity coach intervention ( Walk On ! ) compare standard care 1,650 COPD patient large integrated health care system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Walk On ! Physical Activity Coaching</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical inactivity significantly associate frequent hospitalization increase mortality COPD even adjust disease severity . While practice guideline recommend regular physical activity patient COPD , health system challenge operationalizing effective sustainable approach assist patient physically active . A pragmatic randomized control trial design use determine effectiveness 12-month home community-based physical activity coach intervention ( Walk On ! ) compare standard care 2,700 COPD patient large integrated health care system . Eligible patient COPD-related hospitalization , emergency department visit , observational stay previous 12 month automatically identify electronic medical record ( EMR ) system randomize treatment arm . The Walk On ! intervention include collaborative monitoring step count , semi-automated step goal recommendation , individualized reinforcement physical activity coach , peer/family support . The primary composite outcome include all-cause hospitalization , emergency department visit , observational stay , death 12 month follow randomization . Secondary outcome include COPD-related utilization , cardio-metabolic marker , physical activity , symptom , health-related quality life . With exception patient report outcome , utilization clinical variable automatically capture EMR . If successful , findings multi-stakeholder drive trial generalizable scalable physical activity intervention model , carefully design sufficient flexibility , intensity , duration , support large ethnically diverse sample could re-define standard care effectively address physical inactivity COPD .</detailed_description>
