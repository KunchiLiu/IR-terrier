	<brief_title>Trial Ponatinib Patients With Bevacizumab-Refractory Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Ponatinib specific disease approve us . Ponatinib drug may stop cancer cell grow affect different kind proteins cancer cell . Glioblastoma cell driven mutate form protein call c-kit ( KIT ) present glioblastoma cell . Laboratory study suggest ponatinib activity mutate form ( KIT ) important glioblastoma therefore suggest ponatinib may help control growth glioblastoma . In research study study team look see ponatinib safe able control growth glioblastoma people respond treatment bevacizumab .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 Participants must histologically confirm glioblastoma variant . Subjects initial diagnosis lower grade glioma eligible subsequent biopsy determine glioblastoma variant . Patients must unequivocal progression magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan . A scan must perform within 14 day prior registration steroid dose stable decrease least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date imaging initiation study treatment , new baseline MRI/CT require . Participants must bidimensionally measurable disease minimum measurement 1 cm per dimension MRI perform within 14 day prior first treatment . If receiving corticosteroid , participant must stable decrease dose corticosteroid least 5 day prior baseline MRI . There limit number prior relapse recent relapse must first relapse bevacizumabcontaining regimen . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL ( ≥ 3,000/mm3 ) Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL ( &gt; 1,500/mm3 ) Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL ( ≥ 100,000/ mm3 ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal , unless due Gilbert 's syndrome . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ( per 24 hour urine collection calculate accord CockcroftGault formula ) subject creatinine level institutional normal Serum lipase amylase ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal . Participants must fully recover ( grade ≤ 1 baseline deem irreversible ) clinically significant acute toxicity relate prior therapy ( exception lymphopenia , common therapy temozolomide ) . Patients discontinue bevacizumab previously due bevacizumabrelated toxicity allow participate . The following time period must elapse prior plan start date study treatment : ≥2 week 6 half life approve TKIs investigational agent , whichever long ≥4 week prior cytotoxic therapy , except ≥ 3 week last dose temozolomide ≥6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ≥2 week noncytotoxic agent ≥ 3 week bevacizumab Participants must develop progressive disease receive prior radiation therapy must interval least 12 week completion radiation therapy study entry ( unless progressive tumor growth outside radiation field histopathological confirmation recurrent tumor ) . Participants may receive prior therapy Src , PDGFR , FGFR inhibitor . Prior treatment antiVEGFR antiVEGF agent also allow one relapse follow bevacizumabcontaining regimen allow . For female childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test must document prior registration . NOTE : In addition screening , serum pregnancy test must perform female childbearing potential within 72 hour start investigational product . When possible , test oneinthesame ( screen pregnancy test perform within 72 hour first ponatinib dose , need repeat ) . The effect ponatinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason ponatinib know teratogenic animal model , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 4 month end treatment . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . NOTE : Consent document sign 30 day prior registration . If &gt; 30 day elapse since patient sign consent document , s/he must reconsent ( new signature ) proceeding register onto study . Participants must sufficient tissue prior surgery confirmation diagnosis correlative study . The following amount tissue require : 15 ( 5 μm thick ) unstained formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) section 12 H &amp; E stain slide , additional unstained 5 μm slide ( ) stain Protocol treatment plan must include begin therapy within 5 consecutive day registration . Participants may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ponatinib . Participants receive prior treatment interstitial brachytherapy , stereotactic radiosurgery , implant chemotherapy source , wafer polifeprosan 20 carmustine Participants poorly control diabetes define HgbA1c ≥ 7.0 % Participants grade ≥ 3 peripheral motor sensory neuropathy . Participants receive medication substance moderate strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 , include enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) within 14 day first dose ponatinib exclude . This category include phenobarbital , phenytoin , fosphenytoin , primidone , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine . Lists include medication substance know potential interact CYP3A4 isoenzymes provide Appendix B . NOTE : Participants must avoid consumption Seville orange ( juice ) , grapefruit grapefruit juice , grapefruit hybrid , pummelo exotic citrus fruit 7 day prior first dose study drug entire study treatment period due potential CYP3A4 interaction . Participants take medication know associated Torsades de Pointes QT prolongation . Refer Tables C1 C2 Appendix C list prohibit drug . Participants take herbal preparations/medications study within 7 day prior first dose study drug , include limited : St. John 's wort , Kava , ephedra ( huang ) , gingko biloba , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , yohimbe , saw palmetto , ginseng . Participants underwent major surgery ( include craniotomy ) significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior initiate therapy . Baseline MRIs participant underwent salvage surgery must obtain least 4 week procedure must measurable disease . Participants underwent minor surgical procedure within 7 day prior initiate therapy . History bleed disorder . Patients gastrointestinal bleed hemorrhage/bleeding event CTCAE Grade &gt; /= 3 within 30 day prior study entry . Patients whose MRI scan demonstrate intratumoral hemorrhage peritumoral hemorrhage eligible treatment deem significant treating physician . If question , treat physician contact study 's Overall PI , Dr. Lee History acute pancreatitis within 1 year study treatment history chronic pancreatitis . History alcohol abuse . Uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia ( triglyceride &gt; 450 mg/dL ) Clinically significant , uncontrolled , active cardiovascular disease , specifically include , restrict : Any history myocardial infarction Any history clinically significant ( determined treat physician ) atrial arrhythmia Any history ventricular arrhythmia Any history Cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) Any history peripheral arterial occlusive disease require rvascularization Unstable angina within 6 month prior enrollment Congestive heart failure within 6 month prior enrollment Venous thromboembolism include deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism within 6 month prior enrollment Unacceptable Screening Baseline Cardiovascular Assessment : Baseline MUGA Echocardiogram demonstrate LVEF &lt; 50 % QTc &gt; 480 msec screen ECG ( use QTcF formula ) Uncontrolled hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg ; systolic &gt; 140 mm Hg ) . Patients hypertension treatment study entry effect blood pressure control . Ongoing active infection . The requirement intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic consider active infection . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Testing required absence prior documentation know history . Pregnant breastfeeding . Pregnant woman exclude study ponatinib potential teratogenic abortifacient effect animal model . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ponatinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated ponatinib . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Malabsorption syndrome gastrointestinal illness could affect oral absorption study drug . Individuals history different malignancy , cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , ineligible , except diseasefree least 5 year , deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy OR primary malignancy neither currently clinically significant require active intervention . Any condition illness , opinion Investigator , would compromise patient safety interfere evaluation drug . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction ponatinib . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
