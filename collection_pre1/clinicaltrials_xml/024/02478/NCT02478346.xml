	<brief_summary>This study focus implement Yellow 560 direct intraoperative visualization Fluorescein Sodium stain intracranial lesion facilitate extend surgery , develop well treatment protocol , improve prognosis wide array neurosurgical disease . More specifically , patient undergo surgical intervention treatment brain aneurysm , tumor , arteriovenous malformation fistula , investigator inject dye intraoperatively assess residual aneurysm , tumor general residual lesion must correct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Yellow 560 Microscope Intraoperative Visualization Fluorescein Stained Intracranial Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research design prospective clinical study . All patient enrol study prepare surgery per standard neurosurgical indication , procedure institution protocol . At time anesthesia induction , patient general anesthesia , Fluorescein Sodium 10 % ( 100mg/1mL ) dose 500mg ( 100mg/ml ) administer intravenously ( optimal dosage determine within study minimal dose adequate visualization use ) . Surgery continue aid Yellow 560 microscope minimum delay 10 minute injection reduce amount leakage Fluorescein Sodium surround tissue . Conventional microsurgical biopsy procedure technique include histopathology intraoperative imaging perform completion surgery . The surgeon resect remove believe tumor base previously know criterion ( standard care ) regardless Fluorescein angiography demonstrate . For vascular lesion , fluorescein sodium 10 % ( 100mg/1mL ) inject used ass application conventional method confirm exclusion aneurysm . No patient 's care affect result Fluorescein angiography . No additional neurosurgical instrument use . Patients treat post-operatively conventional adjunctive therapy image deem necessary attend neurosurgeon evaluation extent surgery . Follow-up data ( include post-operative image assess outcome complication ) collect patient standard post-operative visit . Intra-operative film recording patient data may save use accord HIPAA allowance .</detailed_description>
