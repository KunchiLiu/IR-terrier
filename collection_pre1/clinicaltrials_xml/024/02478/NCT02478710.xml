	<brief_title>Aerosolized Antibiotics Treatment Ventilator Associated Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) remain serious problem critically ill patient incidence 8-28 % mortality range 24-57 % . A landmark study compare eight day versus fifteen day antibiotic therapy report pulmonary infection recurrence rate 26-29 % . Costs associate VAP reach $ 40,000 per occurrence . Aerosolized antibiotic use treat ailment cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis . Previous research indicate aerosolized antibiotic attain 200 fold great concentration lung blood , sputum trough level remain 20 fold great acceptable serum antibiotic trough . Additionally , aerosolize antibiotic consider safe ( without increase risk bacterial resistance ) well treatment success compare control ( OR 2.75 , 95 % CI 1.06-7.17 ) , although mortality benefit identify . Some study show reduced systemic toxicity use aerosolized antibiotic others show difference . Aerosolized tobramycin prevents pseudomonas infection patient Cystic Fibrosis . Furthermore aerosolize antibiotic improve pulmonary function patient , include Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , decrease need hospitalization . Lung transplant patient patient Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) also benefit aerosolized fungal prophylaxis treatment . The benefit less clear patient non-Cystic Fibrosis bronchiectasis , although study show benefit aerosolize antibiotic prevent treat nosocomial pneumonia , large prospective randomize trial perform confirm benefit change practice recommendation . Antimicrobials must reach site infection , bind target site , remain bound sufficient time period disrupt life cycle cell . Only 21 % administer antibiotic dose actually end lung parenchyma . Multiple study show ideal particle size inhalation 1 5 micron . Particles small get exhale , particle large reach alveoli . Non-humidified nebulization well drug administration humidify air . Isotonicity drug , pH , presence preservative solution also need evaluate optimal drug delivery function . The ideal method administration aerosolize antibiotic also remain determined . Inhaled tobramycin use several study past thirty year , mostly patient Cystic Fibrosis . It show effective decreasing sputum colony count Pseudomonas Aeruginosa . Inhaled gentamycin also show delay acquisition Pseudomonas child Cystic Fibrosis , well decrease disease progression . Chest tightness persistent cough side effect mention within study . This suggest inhalation safe method administration tobramycin . It show Community-Acquired Pneumonia ( CAP ) alveolar macrophage initiate pro-inflammatory cascade . Failure control excessive inflammation , lead exaggerated systemic response result organ damage . Local systemic level pro-inflammatory mediator show correlate severity disease . The investigator speculate similar response exist patient VAP . The investigator propose prospective , randomized trial design ass value aerosolize antibiotic treatment ventilator associate pneumonia evaluate impact co-existing , non-bacterial pathogen cytokine ability clear pneumonia culture-proven case VAP . Eligible patient randomized time bronchoalveolar lavage combicath receive either adjuvant aerosolized antibiotic plus routine IV antibiotic aerosolize placebo plus routine IV antibiotic . Individual clinical indicator record used monitor effect aerosolize antibiotic [ temperature , leukocyte count , chest radiograph appearance , ratio arterial oxygen partial pressure fractional inspire oxygen ( PaO2/FiO2 ratio ) , mechanical ventilation status , vital sign ] .</detailed_description>
