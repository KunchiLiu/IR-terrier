	<detailed_description>Hospitalization medical illness unique miss opportunity intervention alcohol use disorder ( AUDs ) . Referrals help link patient hospital alcohol treatment . But patient return heavy drinking hospital discharge follow-up alcohol treatment , risk hospital readmission . Pharmacotherapy efficacy AUD , adherence medication poor . Furthermore , medication rarely prescribe general medical setting , hospitalization . Beginning treatment AUD hospitalization medical illness could broaden reach effective treatment likely effective delay treatment specialist visit treatment program entry . Hospital discharge time risk ( i.e. , drink non-adherence medical care ) opportunity ( i.e. , begin alcohol treatment complete medical treatment ) . Interventions work quickly improve adherence could improve medical alcohol-related outcome . Oral naltrexone ( PO-NTX ) , more-costly-per-dose long-acting injectable extend release naltrexone ( XR-NTX ) Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved efficacious treatment AUD . The XR-NTX half-life 5-10 day dose monthly , whereas PO-NTX half-life 13 hour dose daily . The long half-life XR-NTX translates patient receive effective pharmacotherapy long time without adhere daily dose . Thus , although costly per dose , great effectiveness could mean overall reduce cost care ( include alcohol-related health consequence healthcare utilization ) . Despite potential difference cost patient preference , PO-NTX XR-NTX directly compare randomize control trial ( RCT ) , study treatment medical hospital discharge , effectiveness real world practice setting compare standard care unknown . This trial significant address clinically relevant comparative effectiveness question lead great adoption effective cost-effective approach treat AUD pharmacotherapy general hospital .</detailed_description>
