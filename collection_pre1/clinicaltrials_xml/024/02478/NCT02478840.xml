As secondary objective , long term efficacy Lamazym investigate upon endurance measure change baseline number meter walk six minute ( 6MWT ) , upon pulmonary function , motor proficiency BOT-2 hearing capability audiometry . In addition , cognitive development assess Leiter-R test . CNS involvement evaluate MRI/MRS ( patient previously participate rhLAMAN-02 trial ) , CSF biomarkers ( Tau , NFL , GFAp ) CSF biomarkers oligosaccharide . Clearance oligosaccharides urine measure . Long-term safety Pharmaco-Kinetic ( PK ) profile long-term treatment measure rhLAMAN level plasma assess well . Quality life assess questionnaire ( CHAQ EQ-5D-5L ) .</detailed_description>
