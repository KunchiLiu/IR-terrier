	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use inhale hyper polarize xenon-129 ( 129Xe ) gas , conventional contrast help visualize impaired lung function detect change time patient receive treatment well n't . 129Xe special type xenon gas inhale MRI may able show area abnormal thickening part lung . These image combine image take injected contrast agent special type MRI conventional proton ( 1H ) MRI may provide good way look lung structure function . The ultimate goal predict degree radiation-induced lung injury develop give patient give treatment plan . The investigator anticipate image provide specific information lung disease standard lung function test . The use 129Xe MRI investigational . Investigational mean test yet approve US Food Drug Administration available research study like one . In addition , standard MRI contrast typically do standard care monitoring change due thoracic radiation therapy , therefore , use study also consider investigational . Healthy volunteer ask participate study develop database functional image representative healthy lung .</brief_summary>
