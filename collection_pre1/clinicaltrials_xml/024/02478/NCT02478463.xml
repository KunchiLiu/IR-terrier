	<brief_summary>Cabotegravir ( CAB ) long-acting ( LA ) promise candidate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) pre exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) due potent antiretroviral activity infrequent dosing requirement . Currently , CAB concentration achieve anatomical site associate sexual HIV transmission follow propose 600 milligram ( mg ) intramuscular ( IM ) PrEP dose unknown . These data enhance understanding CAB distribution anatomical mucosal tissue believe relevant sexual HIV-1 transmission supplement data support future PrEP clinical trial development . The primary objective determine PK concentration CAB follow LA administration plasma vaginal tissue ( VT ) , cervical tissue ( CT ) , cervicovaginal fluid ( CVF ) healthy woman rectal tissue ( RT ) rectal fluid ( RF ) healthy men woman follow single 600 mg IM dose . This Phase 1 , open label study healthy subject assess pharmacokinetics CAB LA plasma mucosal location associate sexual HIV-1 transmission : vaginal tissue , cervical tissue , cervicovaginal fluid , rectal tissue , rectal fluid . The study consist screening period , 28-day oral lead-in phase dose 30 mg per day follow 14-21 day washout period , single dose CAB LA 600 mg IM ( intragluteal ) injection compartmental pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample 12 week . Subjects return safety assessment plasma PK sample Week 24 Week 36 post-injection undergo follow-up/withdrawal visit Week 52 post-injection</brief_summary>
