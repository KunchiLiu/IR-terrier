	<brief_title>Early Treatment With Sofosbuvir ( SOF ) Ledipasvir ( LDV ) Prevent HCV Recurrence After Liver Transplantation ( OLT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C viral infection ( HCV ) lead end-stage liver disease lead indication liver transplant worldwide . HCV recurrence follow liver transplantation universal , associate 100-fold increase viremia level , run accelerate course , lead graft cirrhosis 30 % patient within 5 year . Successful eradication HCV post transplant normalize long term survival HCV positive liver transplant recipient . This study aim treat HCV infection start time transplant . The study single centre , single arm , open-label , proof concept study enrol 20 adult primary liver transplant recipient genotype 1 HCV infection . Subjects receive Sofosbuvir ( SOF ) 400 mg Ledipasvir ( LDV ) 90 mg fix dose combination ( FDC ) tablet start time liver transplantation ( OLT ) continue 12 week . Subjects receive 24 week post-treatment follow . The study investigate patient achieve sustained virological response ( SVR ) 12 week cessation treatment ( SVR12 ) . Furthermore , safety efficacy treatment regimen begin time transplant investigate .</detailed_description>
