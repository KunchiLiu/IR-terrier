	<brief_summary>Cervical lymph node involvement , head cancer neck patient , one important prognostic factor . Currently patient undergo neck dissection remove node neck involvement retrospectively determine . Sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) identification biopsy become clinical practise area include breast , skin , gastric cancer . The gold standard detect metastatic lymph node pathological analysis , lack accurate clinically accept way identify sentinel lymph nod cervical region motivate usage indocyanine green ( ICG ) near-infrared fluorescence ( NIR ) imaging ( Pinpoint , Novadaq , Waterloo ) . A prospective clinical trial use commercially available NIR system ICG injection around tumour site evaluate ability detect biopsy sentinel lymph node head neck cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping Oral Cancer Using Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical system fluorescence image use ICG recently publish report SLN identification rate 94-100 % breast colorectal cancer . The traditional radioisotope method enable navigation site skin incision measurement radiation uptake , whereas ICG fluorescence method precisely identify site skin incision trace lymphatic vessel across skin without radiation exposure . Systematic review show incidence false negative SLN biopsy high head neck application . Therefore , fluorescence SLN method , potentially provide precise information regard lymph node remove . As ICG fluorescence technique identify basin include SLNs also para-SLNs lymphatic vessel drain , average number lymph node remove also tend increase . In preliminary study , ICG technique achieves high identification rate comparable radioactive method . There date , however , limited study technique area oral cancer lymph node map . In study propose evaluate potential application ICG mapping detection SLN cancer head neck comparison radioactive agent method . We hypothesize NIR-guided SLNB could present new , safe sensitive alternative addition conventional SLN procedure .</detailed_description>
