	<brief_title>Using Ex-vivo Normothermic Machine Perfusion With Organox Metraâ„¢ Device Store Human Livers Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver transplantation life-saving procedure success limited shortage suitable donor organ . Much emphasis place optimise condition organ available , enable high risk organ transplant safely . An effective mean pre-transplant viability assessment would allow great use high risk donor also minimise risk primary non-function identify exclude non-viable organ subject patient risk surgery . Organ storage normothermic perfusion condition enable organ function evaluate prior transplantation show prevent organ injury sustain standard cold storage . This trial examine safety feasibility use OrganOx Metra device transport store donor liver normothermic condition prior transplantation . This study evaluate liver function post-transplantation use standard clinical parameter . Participants follow 3 month follow transplantation outcomes record . Participants undergo study procedure . Feasibility measure use ratio actual / eligible candidate donor recruit study also encompass logistical issue respect transportation , ease use . Safety assess rate device failure result organ discard , primary graft non-function , re-transplantation , recipient death .</detailed_description>
