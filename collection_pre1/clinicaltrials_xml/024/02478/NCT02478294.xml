	<brief_title>Comparison Between Thoracoscopic Left Atrial Appendage Excision Warfarin Secondary Prevention Stroke Patients With AF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brief Summary : This cohort study aim compare thoracoscopic leave atrial appendage excision warfarin secondary prevention stroke non-central nervous systemic embolism patient atrial fibrillation thromboembolism . Detailed Description : BACKGROUND : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) one common cardiac arrhythmia show important cause stroke . AF responsible 15 % stroke . Most strokes AF cause cardioembolism . The left atrial appendage ( LAA ) dominant source cardioembolism . The great priority treat AF stroke prevention . There 3 main approach prevention : ( 1 ) oral anticoagulation ( OAC ) , ( 2 ) eradication AF , ( 3 ) exclusion LAA systemic circulation . OAC therapy , include warfarin novel oral anti-coagulants , effectively reduce risk stroke AF currently first line treatment patient AF one risk factor . Despite advancement medical therapy , risk stroke patient AF undergo optimal anticoagulation therapy still remain 2 % 5 % per year , regardless agent use . The limitation OAC include ( 1 ) patient unsuitability OAC , ( 2 ) increase risk bleeding , ( 3 ) need monitor optimal international normalize ratio ( INR ) level ( warfarin ) , ( 4 ) patient noncompliance . Percutaneous method ablation widely use attempt eliminate AF . Approximately 20 % patient underwent ablation AF recurrence . It well-demonstrated occurrence guideline recommend discontinuation warfarin equivalent therapy ablation . Since least 90 % leave atrial thrombus find within LAA , plausible occlusion lead decrease risk stroke patient AF . However , evidence surgical ligation extremely limited . AIM OF THE STUDY : The primary objective study evaluate whether thoracoscopic LAA excision purpose prevention thromboembolism pt AF thromboembolism superior warfarin reduce composite endpoint stroke , TIA systemic embolism . The primary efficacy endpoint define composite stroke ( include ischemic hemorrhagic ) , document TIA , systemic embolism . The secondary endpoint cardiovascular death , hospitalization due cardiovascular cerebral disease , major fatal bleeding event , minor bleeding complication . STUDY DESIGN : This single-center prospective cohort study . Adult patient non-valvular AF previous history stroke eligible inclusion study . Approximately 300 patient paroxysmal persistent AF stroke receive warfarin treatment target INR 2.0 3.0 surgical LAA excision . Follow-up patient include visit 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 .</detailed_description>
