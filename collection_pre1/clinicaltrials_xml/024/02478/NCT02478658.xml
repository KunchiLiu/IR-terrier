	<brief_title>Circulatory Levels Irisin Response Acute Resistance Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose study study circulate level irisin response acute high-intensity resistance train group healthy young adult . Sample : The sample comprise adult men woman unpaid volunteer age 18 30 . We recruit 44 participant . Pre- screening assessment : Informed consent , PAR-Q , Medical History Exercise History use determine health status prior exercise experience . Menstrual cycle log require female participant . Pre-Intervention assessment ( baseline ) : - Anthropometric measurement Body Composition : Height , triceps , thigh calf skinfolds , biceps , thigh , hip , waist , calf circumference measure . Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) perform obtain body composition . - Blood-related variable . Baseline glucose , lactate hematocrit obtain participant prior intervention . Lactate Hematocrit obtain pre-intervention post-intervention , within 1 min post workout . Irisin obtain blood sample baseline , train session . Irisin measure via commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . - Cardiopulmonary Strength Fitness Testing . Cardiopulmonary fitness determine via maximum oxygen consumption test . One maximum repetition ( 1-RM ) use assess muscular fitness . - Dietary Controls . Each participant complete Food Preference Questionnaire . In addition , Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall ( ASA24 ) collect day prior session . - Familiarization . Participant instruct muscle conditioning technique use strength train technique master . The rate perceive exertion ( RPE ) scale also use familiarization session . - Spontaneous Physical Activity : Daily activity level 7 day collect . Intervention : Resistance train consist circuit train 3 set 7 exercise focus major muscle group . Ten repetition circuit 70 % maximum capacity perform . Acute intervention consist one session . Blood collect pre-session , 45 min session , immediately acute intervention exposure ( post-session ) .</detailed_description>
