	<detailed_description>PLEASE NOTE : The grant project approve title `` Tobacco Treatment Employable Californians , '' abbreviate `` TTEC . '' However , study run principle community- base participatory research , Stanford team provide community advisor representative recruitment site opportunity create name felt well convey interest goal study potential participant . As , term Total IMPACT Study use participant-facing material . Dr. Prochaska oversee study procedure participant recruitment , informed consent , data collection , analysis , dissemination . IRB approve study flyer e-communications promote study central study contact phone number email address hold study coordinator . The study follow Dillman method electronic communication invite encourage potential respondent participate . For systematic data collection storage , assessment conduct use Qualtrics RedCap online data collection data encryption add security protection . Face-to-face inform consent procedure occur onsite employment agency . Some participant may call get preliminarily screen eligibility phone , direct meet on-site staff begin consent process . Hired train field research study staff recent job-seeking client agency complete inform consenting procedure participant , obtain collateral contact information follow-up contact , provide participant study ID code website URL complete online survey . The collateral contact information use research staff reach participant directly . Study staff may ask collateral contact update contact information well updated smoke and/or employment status ( e.g. , `` Has [ name ] smoking recently ? '' `` Do know [ name ] currently work ? ) Study eligibility define unemployed job seek participate America 's Job Centers California ( AJCC ) organization currently smoke 1 cigarette daily least 100+ cigarettes one 's lifetime carbon monoxide ( CO ) breath sample 10 ppm great . The CO sample take prior consent potential participant . Participants must 18 year old , English literate , able provide least three collateral source contact follow-up assessment , immediately plan relocate California ( though researcher would continue follow-up participant move area , research team demonstrate success prior study ) . Dual use e-cigarettes exclusion criterion . If participant meet eligibility criterion , baseline assessment complete on-site employment agency . A computer-generated stratified random assignment program randomize individual base recruitment location , heaviness smoking ( &gt; 1 pack/week ) , stage change , last two variable know related outcome address intervention . Participants give study material appropriate assign study condition directly complete baseline survey on-site . The online survey collect personal identifying information . Assessments conducted baseline 3- 6-months follow-up . The survey take 40 minute complete . If participant come person survey , research staff send URL link , complete phone , send modify version mail . As part data collection , participant ask provide resume curriculum vitae baseline interview , either hard copy email , de-identified ( participant name address remove ) . The resume share staff employment service facility . In detailed manner capture self-report online survey , resume provide useful information prior employment ( # job , industry , position hold , length employment ) education well indication participant communication/organization skills self-presentation employment strength . Participants option opt provide resume . The two study condition : Tobacco Intervention ( n=180 ) Usual Care Control group ( n=180 ) . The tobacco treatment include : ( ) Transtheoretical-model ( TTM ) tailor , computer-assisted web-delivered program focus increase intrinsic motivation , ( b ) stage-tailored treatment manual goal set quit tobacco , ( c ) education proper use nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT , patch plus gum lozenge ) guidance obtain low-cost free NRT MediCal , private insurance plan , community program . The computer program ass stage change TTM construct temptation , decisional balance , process change . Repeat intervention contact occur baseline , 3- 6-months follow-up , provide iterative computerized feedback reflect prior response encouragement quit smoking relapse prevention . Usual care : Participants complete study assessment baseline , 3- 6-months receive referral tobacco treatment community , include state quitline , line public health `` Ask , Advise , Refer '' model tobacco cessation intervention . Measures : Primary Tobacco Outcome : At baseline follow-up , past 7-day use conventional cigarette , alternative tobacco ( smokeless , snus ) , electronic nicotine device ( ENDS , e.g. , e-cigarettes ) detail cigarettes/day , frequency , brand , flavor , strength , quit attempt assess . For biochemical verification , participant report 7-day PPA follow-up expire CO sample evaluate use Bedfont Smokerlyzer . Participants CO &lt; 8 ppm indicate nonsmoking provide saliva sample test cotinine Accutest® NicAlertTM test strip 3- 6-month follow-up . Salivary cotinine level &lt; 15 ng/ml confirm nonsmoking . Additionally , participant report quit ask provide urine sample test presence anabasine ( quit smoking still use nicotine replacement another nicotine contain product ) . Anabasine alternative indicator tobacco exposure separate nicotine . For participant lose follow-up unable return biochemical verification , saliva cotinine test mail , along prepay envelope return result study staff . Secondary Tobacco Outcomes : 3-mo prolonged abstinence 3- 6-mo assessment , apply NHLBI 's definition relapse ( i.e. , smoke 7 consecutive day smoke least week 2 consecutive week ) ; 42 reduction cigarette per week ; give uncertainty field respect treat ENDS , examine proportion sample abstinent conventional cigarette tobacco , allow ENDS use . The observational Personal Professional Presence ( P3 ) checklist scale currently pilot test , evaluation relation measure CO level analyze indicator treatment compliance use instrumental variable tobacco outcome analysis . Employment Outcomes : The primary employment outcome interest quickly participant find employment , measure week . Time work assess baseline . Secondary employment outcomes interest : employment status follow-up employment secure point time study assess 3- 6-month follow-up . Additional detail obtain type position , pay/salary , fit secure desired position , change employment time . The number on-phone in-person interview also record . Descriptive Measures .
