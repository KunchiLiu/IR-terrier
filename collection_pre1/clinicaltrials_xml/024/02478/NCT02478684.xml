	<brief_summary>Delayed cord clamping ( DCC ) 30 60 second allow blood continue flow placenta umbilical cord infant , thus result placental transfusion . This transfusion may improve circulating volume birth lead smooth postnatal transition overall improve outcome preterm infant . The average blood volume deliver DCC 90 second preterm infant estimate 12 ml per kg vaginal delivery result slightly high transfusion compare cesarean delivery . Several several short-term benefit describe include reduction need blood transfusion well possible reduction intraventricular hemorrhage necrotizing enterocolitis . All mother threaten preterm delivery 28 34 6/7 week approach study . Following consent , infant randomly assign either 30 60 second delay cord clamp delivery room . If infant breathe 30 second , cord clamp infant move resuscitation area . The primary outcome 3 percent difference hematocrit one hour ( routinely obtain baby ) . With approximately 75 neonate group ( 30 60 second DCC ) , 80 % power detect difference mean hematocrit 3 % use two-sample t-test 0.05 two-sided significance level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Placental transfusion birth think immediate , short-term long-term benefit neonate . Delaying cord clamp think allow smooth postnatal transition necessary cardiopulmonary change take place specifically infant establishes spontaneous respiration and/or experimentally mechanical ventilation initiate . By allow infant establish respiration , pulmonary vascular bed able relax prior removal low-resistance placental vascular bed , thus avoid reflexive bradycardia . A 2012 Cochrane review DCC preterm infant suggest several short-term benefit include reduction need blood transfusion well possible reduction intraventricular hemorrhage necrotizing enterocolitis . The American College Obstetrics Gynecology ( ACOG ) publish committee opinion December 2012 state current evidence support delay cord clamp preterm infant . They go support DCC 30-60 second show improve transitional circulation , decrease need blood transfusion , may even reduce incidence intraventricular hemorrhage . The primary objective study determine delay cord clamp 60 second lead improved postnatal transition demonstrate high initial hematocrit 30 minute preterm neonate bear 28 34+6/7 week gestation . The investigator determine whether significant difference primary outcome delay 30 second versus 60 second . A secondary objective determine effect DCC additional measure Apgar score , initial heart rate , initial temperature , blood pressure measure , fluid resuscitation and/or need pressor , peak bilirubin , day phototherapy . Inclusion Criteria : Preterm infant bear 28 34+6/7 week gestation . Exclusion Criteria : Infant suspect placental abruption , bleed placenta previa , terminal bradycardia , cord prolapse , meconium , major congenital anomaly . All mother threaten preterm delivery 28 34 6/7 week approach study . If consent obtain , infant randomly assign either 30 60 second delay cord clamp delivery room . All delivery room staff notify assignment prior delivery . The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) staff present delivery , include NICU Fellow , NICU nurse , and/or neonatal nurse practitioner pediatric resident . In case C-Section , NICU fellow sterile gown glove order ass infant sterile field . The timer start immediately follow delivery entire infant . In case vaginal delivery infant place mother 's leg mother 's abdomen case cesarean section . The fellow evaluate infant ass onset respiration stimulate cover infant plastic wrap . If infant good tone sustain breathing , umbilical cord continue unclamped though maximum 60 second . If infant begin establish respiration 30 second , cord clamp infant transfer radiant warmer regardless original assignment . The primary outcome 3 percent difference hematocrit one hour ( routinely obtain baby ) . With approximately 75 neonate group ( 30 60 second DCC ) , 80 % power detect difference mean hematocrit 3 % use two-sample t-test 0.05 two-sided significance level .</detailed_description>
