	<brief_summary>This study investigate influence two different stretch technique flexibility muscle posterior thigh , train period . The study last six week volunteer need go lab twice evaluation , four week , three time week application stretch training . Evaluation training period consist apply hip knee flexibility test , evaluation strength , muscle activation muscle architecture . The Flexibility test : ( 1 ) Straight Leg Raise Flexibility Test ( SLR ) , volunteer position supine stretcher . Then appraiser perform hip flexion keep knee extend relaxed foot angle person refer discomfort contralateral limb remain firmly lean table ; ( 2 ) Modified Passive knee extension ( TEJ ) , volunteer position supine stretcher . The assessor shall determine hip member rat 90ยบ perform knee extension angle person refer discomfort . The contralateral limb remain firmly lean table . For evaluation muscle strength volunteer sit equipment , make five repetition bend straighten knee familiarize equipment make five replicates maximum strength . To evaluate electrical activity depilation skin razor clean alcohol swab adhesive electrode place collection muscle activity , electrodes emit shock . The muscle architecture assess via ultrasound , use use water soluble gel improve machine 's skin contact require . For intervention , stretch hold leg , volunteer remain lie stretcher fix trunk velcro strap researcher carry elongation raise leg draw moment discomfort volunteer refer remain 30 second ( ) case belong passive static stretch group , stretch group proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation , position , 30 stretching , push 6 low leg researcher . If belongs control group , two trip laboratory testing , make initial assessment four week return perform test , period assessment need go lab make intervention elongation . It possible discomfort flexibility testing , strength test stretch training . After test still experience muscle pain disappear within 48 hour . The risk research minimal , exceed strength training session stretch .</brief_summary>
