	<brief_summary>Fetal growth abnormalities one common problem face modern obstetrics . The association low birth weight perinatal death well severe morbidity well know . Since fetal weight measure directly , obstetrician use estimate fetal weight obtain utilize various ultrasonographic measurement diagnose growth abnormality . Currently clinical practice , majority fetal ultrasound center employ population-based fetal growth curve previously publish updated estimate fetal weight percentile . Up 70 % neonate find 10 % percentile estimate fetal weight population-based growth curve actually constitutionally small ; neonate deem `` small '' base standardized growth curve reality reach appropriate growth potential relation genetic predisposition . An equally difficult clinical scenario fetal macrosomia . A recent meta-analysis reveal sensitivity specificity ultrasound detection fetal macrosomia range 15-79 % . When compare neonate normal birth weight , odds ratio emergency cesarean delivery shoulder dystocia increase significantly . Various ultrasound parameter test effort detect fetal compromise prior development permanent damage allow differentiation true fetal growth abnormality normal growth potential . Recent report introduce concept customized fetal growth curve use physiological variable report adjust fetal growth assessment . To date , use customized fetal growth curve evaluate prospectively . Furthermore , strategy compare standard population-based fetal growth curve currently use clinical practice determine would ideal use clinical practice . The primary research question : customized fetal growth curve accurate population-based fetal growth curve predict abnormality fetal growth , define small-for-gestational age large-for-gestational age birth newborns high-risk pregnancy ? Randomly , participant assign either fetal growth report customized population base growth curve .</brief_summary>
