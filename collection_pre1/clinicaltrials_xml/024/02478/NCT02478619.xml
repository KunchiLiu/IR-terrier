	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect preoperative inspiratory muscle training patient grade III obesity undergo bariatric surgery . It double-blind randomize controlled clinical trial volunteer allocate two group compare accord postoperative evolution ( pulmonary complication , lung function , strength endurance respiratory muscle respiratory system resistance ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Inspiratory Muscle Training Gastroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity significantly increase recent year represent public health problem due increase risk mortality various cause . Changes respiratory system arise obesity well establish include reduction compliance increase ventilatory work oxygen consumption breathing . Bariatric surgery alternative surgical treatment obesity patient undergo surgery susceptible post operative pulmonary complication result obesity also abdominal surgery . The inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) use pre post operative period improve muscle strength endurance , beyond perception dyspnea.There suggestion preoperative training may contribute best post operative evolution patient , benefit clearly define literature . The objective evaluate effect preoperative IMT post operative patient undergo gastroplasty . There 40 patient bariatric surgery group Ribeirão Preto Medical School sex , BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 appropriate inclusion criteria.They assess pulmonary function test , measurement strength endurance respiratory muscle , submaximal exercise test , dyspnea quality life scale . All patient receive standard treatment randomly divide two group , name control group train group , train 4 week preoperatively . The patient reassess 4 week train 15th postoperative return day . The evolution data pulmonary complication collect medical record , note medical staff physical therapy routine service .</detailed_description>
