	<brief_title>Addressing Real-world Anticoagulant Management Issues Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ARAMIS Registry multicenter , cohort study patient present acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) take chronic anticoagulation therapy . The goal ARAMIS ( 1 ) examine prevalence preadmission novel oral anticoagulant use among patient AIS ICH ; ( 2 ) describe characterize coagulation test use assess level anticoagulation patient ; ( 3 ) examine utilization safety profile thrombolytic therapy AIS patient take new class anticoagulant ; ( 4 ) document treatment pattern anticoagulation-related ICH compare care outcomes vary novel oral anticoagulant warfarin . The acquisition finding critical importance help fill gap guideline recommendation provide insight management AIS ICH patient treatment new anticoagulant . This allow physician feel confident anticoagulation therapy improve care outcomes patient agent stroke complication . The ARAMIS build upon backbone nation 's large ongoing stroke registry , Get With The Guidelines-Stroke ( GWTG-Stroke ) American Heart Association/American Stroke Association ( AHA/ASA ) . The GWTG-Stroke registry provide data patient demographic , medical history , laboratory result , brain imaging , in-hospital treatment outcome . Using exist resource , ARAMIS create new on-line supplemental data collection module specifically collect information medication prior admission , diagnostic testing , treatment , factor associate treatment decision make well clinical outcome . A total 10,000 consecutive patient 18 year old , experience AIS ( n=5,000 ) take novel oral anticoagulant ( dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban , edoxaban ) ICH ( n=5,000 ) take warfarin one novel oral anticoagulant within 7 day prior stroke onset enrol approximately 3-4 year . Beyond index hospitalization , ARAMIS enroll 2500 consecutive patient ( 1250 AIS 1250 ICH ) survive provide inform consent discharge follow-up study . Trained personnel Duke Clinical Research Institute ( DCRI ) Call Center conduct structure telephone interview patient 3 6 month follow index hospitalization . The follow-up interview extend baseline data collection GWTG-Stroke ARAMIS include long-term medication , downstream care , patient-reported outcome , Obtaining information provide longitudinal perspective care outcome , also allow innovative patient-centered outcome comparative effective research .</detailed_description>
