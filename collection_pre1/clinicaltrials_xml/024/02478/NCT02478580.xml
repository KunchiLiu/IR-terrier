	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) obesity associate increase perioperative morbidity mortality . This group patient risk perioperative desaturations worsen perioperative sedative narcotic need surgery . OSA patient might also need spend night intensive care frequent monitoring desaturations episodes especially patient require multiple intravenous narcotic bolus pain control . Several study look appropriate way manage patient recommendation make avoid outpatient surgery close monitoring first 24 hour surgery specifically patient require intravenous postoperative narcotic . Nuvigil ( Armodafinil ) wake promote agent ( Cephalon inc. , West Chester , PA ) 's FDA approve excessive daytime sleepiness narcolepsy , shift work sleep disorder , obstructive sleep apnea . The precise mechanism ( ) armodafinil ( R-enantiomer ) modafinil ( mixture R- S-enantiomers ) promote wakefulness unknown . Nuvigil longer act product similar action Modafinil however much cheap . Nuvigil previously study postoperative recovery . The investigator intend study effect Nuvigil postoperative recovery time wakefulness obstructive sleep apnea obese patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Modafinil show improve recovery general anesthesia small pilot study involve 30 patient . In study , patient give one dose Modafinil 200mg po versus placebo surgery patient tolerate po sip water discharge home . They ask assess fatigue , alertness energy level follow 24 hr . Modafinil find significantly reduce fatigue improves feeling alertness energy postoperative patient . It conclude patient recover general anesthesia significantly benefit Modafinil . A recent study look perioperative use Modafinil 67 patient present lithotripsy require sedation . Goal asses improvement recovery compare placebo . Patients randomize 4 group 1 2 receive midazolam/ fentanyl sedation plus Modafinil 200mg po give 1 hr sedation versus placebo , two receive remifentanil / propofol infusion plus Modafinil 20 mg po versus placebo . Groups compare use digital symbol substitution test ( DSST ) , trail make test ( TMT ) , observer scale sedation analgesia ( OAA/S ) Aldrete score find statistical significant difference group . However measure Verbal rating scale ( VRS ) score secondary outcome variable e.g . energy , tiredness dizziness also record treatment . They conclude Modafinil reduce patient-reported tiredness sedation/analgesia however improve recovery term objective measure patient psychomotor skill . Nuvigil longer act product similar action Modafinil previously study postoperative recovery . We intend study effect Nuvigil postoperative recovery time wakefulness obstructive sleep apnea patient .</detailed_description>
