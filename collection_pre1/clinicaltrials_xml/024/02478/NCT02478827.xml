	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia associate wide range symptom impact number different domain , include cognitive impairment . Given array cognitive deficit associate schizophrenia relationship daily functioning , numerous research group examine impact cognitive remediation many aspect cognition . However , currently unclear domain cognition target produce widespread durable benefit schizophrenia patient . It may case target lower-level cognitive process important higher-level complex aspect cognition may produce widespread benefit cognition everyday function . Relatively study examine effect work memory process speed training individual schizophrenia , study examine broad-based remediation program . Thus , need target work memory process speed training study well understand mechanism cognitive enhancement training patient . This study aim : 1 ) investigate near-transfer gain associate work memory process speed training schizophrenia patient , 2 ) investigate far-transfer gain associate work memory process speed training ( i.e. , gain neurocognitive domain social cognition ) , 3 ) investigate real-world gain associate training ( i.e. , gain daily function ) . Towards aim , 81 schizophrenia patient recruit randomly assign work memory training group , process speed training group , train control group . Training complete home 30 minute per day , 5 day per week , total 10 week . Neurocognitive , social cognitive , daily function measure administer pre- post-training detect training-related gain .</brief_summary>
