	<brief_summary>Monthly intravitreal ranibizumab ( IVR ) first 6 month great effect macular edema branch retinal vein occlusion ( BVO ) visual anatomical outcome . It expect similar result could obtain less frequent IVR . The purpose study investigate IVR PRN effective monthly . In addition , investigator go study relationship macular edema size location retinal non-perfusion area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Usefulness PRN Regimen Using Ranibizumab Macular Edema Due Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It demonstrate BRAVO study IVR great effect macular edema BVO visual anatomical outcome . However IVR do monthly patient ( except Sham group ) first 6 month BRAVO study . It expect similar result could obtain less frequent IVR , , contribute reduce patient 's burden medical cost . Thus necessary determine optimal regimen IVR therapy . In study , consider medical social circumstance Japan , investigator go investigate IVR PRN effective BRAVO study.In addition , investigator go study relationship macular edema size location retinal non-perfusion area ( NPA ) , VEGF think release non-perfused retinal tissue , VEGF production may correlate NPA size location . The investigator go measure size NPA semi-quantatively ultra wide field fluorescein angiography ( UWFA ) use Optos 200Tx . Then relationship macular edema study . The effect ranibizumab NPA controversial . In study , investigate , .</detailed_description>
