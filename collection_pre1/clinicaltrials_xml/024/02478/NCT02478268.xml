	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use inhale hyperpolarized 129Xe gas , conventional contrast help visualize impaired lung function detect change time patient receive treatment well n't . 129Xe special type xenon gas inhale MRI may able show area abnormal thickening part lung . These image combine image take injected contrast agent type MRI may provide good way look lung structure function patient IPF . The ultimate goal predict particular patient might respond particular therapy observe response earlier conventional test . The investigator anticipate image acquire study provide specific information lung disease standard lung function test . The use 129Xe MRI investigational . `` Investigational '' mean test yet approve US Food Drug Administration test research study like one . In addition , standard MRI contrast typically do standard care monitor progression IPF , therefore , use study also consider investigational . Healthy volunteer ask participate study investigator need develop database functional image representative healthy lung .</brief_summary>
