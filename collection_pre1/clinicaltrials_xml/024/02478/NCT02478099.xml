	<detailed_description>Encouraging clinical data emerge field tumor immunotherapy demonstrate therapy focus enhance T cell response cancer result significant survival benefit patient Stage IV cancer . PD-L1 extracellular protein downregulates immune response primarily peripheral tissue bind two receptor PD-1 B7-1 . Interruption PD L1/PD-1 pathway PD-L1 target antibody MPDL3280A , represent attractive strategy reinvigorate tumor-specific T cell immunity . For PD1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition PD-L1 tumor surface expression propose potential biomarker . In early clinical trial , PD-L1 expression associate response PD1/PD-L1 inhibition . However , clinical trial report response PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor big patient group PD-L1-negative assessed single biopsy . Another obstacle use PD-L1 expression predictive biomarker might potential heterogeneous expression fast dynamic PD-L1 tumor expression whole body distribution , well baseline activation status immune system assess two investigational image trial MPDL3280A-img-042015 IL2-img -- UMCG-2015 . To able evaluate investigational image - 89Zr-MPDL3280A-PET 18F-FB-IL2-PET - complementary tool selection patient treat MPDL3280A , within treatment trial ass safety , tolerability anti-tumor activity MPDL3280A cancer patient , undergone investigational imaging . Acquired data could lead improve , patient friendly , easily accessible possibly less expensive procedure patient selection . Subsequently , efficacy ( combination ) checkpoint inhibition could also improve , thus prevent unnecessary toxicity reduce health care cost .</detailed_description>
