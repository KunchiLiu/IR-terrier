	<brief_title>Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia Versus Local Infiltration Analgesia Following Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enhanced Recovery Programmes ( ERP ) define Henrik Kehlet establish within orthopaedics within United Kingdom number centre ( Malviya et al. , 2011 , McDonald et al. , 2012 , Scott et al. , 2013 ) demonstrate improvement patient outcome . However ERP involve paper redesign number key element clinical pathway remain unclear level significance component may patient 's report outcomes . The use Local Infiltration Analgesia ( LIA ) primary post-operative analgesic technique grow popularity Scotland past 5 year ( Scott et al. , 2013 ) . A number large cohort series concurrently report significant improvement early ambulation shorten length stay ( Malviya et al. , 2011 , McDonald et al. , 2012 ) yet remain unclear whether due introduction use LIA technique overall development ERP programme . The aim parallel group randomise control trial test two different method regional analgesia ( LIA Epidural ) impact attainment predetermine rehabilitation criterion direct discharge home consider impact technique long term functional status one year post surgery . Epidural analgesia utilise post-operative analgesia predominantly use format continuous infusion set volume analgesia ( +/- adjunct fentanyl ) result motor sensory blockade , would expect increase volume infuse . Ambulatory patient epidural use number year within maternity service provide adequate pain relief whilst enable patient mobile ( Stewart &amp; Fernando , 2011 ) . Therefore provide fair comparison LIA technique standard epidural analgesia technique within Golden Jubilee National Hospital adapt Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia ( PCEA ) system background infusion . The plan long term follow period ( One year ) develop enable great evidence impact method functional capacity , Patient Reported Outcome Scores ( PROMS ) monitor incidence adverse incident longer period time previously publish literature .</detailed_description>
