	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In era cardio-metabolic chronic disease ( CMCD ) take epidemic proportion , health system react provide care manage also prevent . Our region demonstrate leadership develop implement regional care frameworks patient trajectory define service throughout continuum care ( community primary specialize care ) . However , diabetes , cardiac rehabilitation 0-5-30 prevention program implement silo . Under leadership decision-makers regional health Agency , order improve accessibility quality care , team work development implementation integrate care framework prevention management cardio-metabolic chronic disease : Agir Sur Sa SantÉ ( ASSSÉ ) . This new framework , base individual/group motivational technique , care protocol collective order , currently implement context community health center ( CSSS ) . The investigator recently receive Quebec Ministry Health grant continue support implementation CSSS , implement care framework family medicine group ( FMG ; spring 2015 ) initiate baseline evaluation ( satisfaction perception questionnaire ) . The investigator hypothesize successful implementation ASSSÉ could improve accessibility indicator , patient affect risk CMCD , patient primary care personnel satisfaction , fidelity , quality continuity care context FMGs . OBJECTIVES : The investigator aim : 1 . Analyze implementation process new ASSSÉ framework context FMGs : ) establish acceptability perceive usefulness patient health professional ; b ) identifying determinant ( barrier facilitator ) implementation ; c ) describing strategy use implement ASSSÉ care framework FMGs . 2 . Estimate size effect ASSSÉ ( include main effect variability effect across FMGs allow inform sample size calculation plan future large-scale trial ) : ) patient ( satisfaction , health outcome ) ; b ) primary care professional ( practice , satisfaction , self-efficacy ) ; c ) health care system ( organizational technical quality care indicator , accessibility continuity care indicator , fidelity care framework ) . 3 . Effectively share knowledge obtain activity relevant stakeholder health care public health sector , include policy maker , decision maker , health care professional patient use innovative tool approach . METHODS AND APPROACH : This participatory research project use mixed-method approach combine qualitative quantitative assessment . The project conduct three step : 1-Pre-implementation evaluation : Services patient trajectory currently provide 14 FMGs Eastern Townships assess use chart review evaluate technical quality care indicator health outcome . The investigator also use questionnaire evaluate concordance Expended chronic care model , self-efficacy , satisfaction personnel patient , potential area target improvement assess organizational quality care . Questionnaires semi-structured group interview health professional , decision-makers patient , risk , CMCD also perform ; 2- Post-implementation evaluation data analysis : 12 , 24 36 month initiation implementation , investigator perform similar evaluation do initial phase . Semi-structured group interview repeat 24 month . Pre- post-implementation comparison perform use pair t-tests continuous variable McNemar test dichotomous variable identify area improvement persistent gap . 3-Knowledge translation ( KT ) : Integrated KT important outcome research , already begin occur throughout project various actor involve . The investigator also reach various target audience ( health professional , decision-makers policy-makers , patient Canadian population ) classic end-of-grant KT production clear executive summary research result . IMPACT : Considering epidemic chronic disease , project important generate knowledge model care integrate preventive management intervention multiple condition primary care , continuum specialize health care service . It also high transferability potential various provincial disease context .</detailed_description>
