Research indicate psychosocial intervention CLBP viable treatment approach entail ( ) deleterious side effect benefit beyond pain reduction . Cognitive Therapy ( CT ) Mindfulness Meditation ( MM ) find feasible effective CLBP . A promising recently develop treatment combine aspect CT MM Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) . MBCT successfully apply problem depression headache ; however , approach investigate CLBP . Thus , current study randomise control trial ( RCT ) design examine effect mechanism ( i.e. , treatment work ) CT , MM , MBCT CLBP . Brain state data ( electroencephalogram ( EEG ) ) well self-report data examine investigate potential unique share mechanism underlie treatment effect . Furthering field 's understanding treatment mechanisms lead development streamline intervention design efficiently maximise benefit individual CLBP , optimise relief suffering .</detailed_description>
