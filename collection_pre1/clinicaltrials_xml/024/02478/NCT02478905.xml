	<brief_summary>The epidemiology transmission dynamic influenza hospital poorly understood , particularly respect subject without symptom influenza infection ( e.g . without fever , cough , sore throat , nasal congestion , weakness , headache , loss appetite , myalgia ) . Knowledge whether asymptomatic subject able transmit influenza major importance . If transmit influenza , vaccination patient healthcare worker ( HCW ) start influenza season , permanent use mask HCW influenza season , quarantine previously expose inpatient may available measure reduce number influenza transmission event asymptomatic subject acute care hospital . The investigator ' key aim therefore define whether exposure asymptomatic subject influenza infection constitutes risk influenza transmission acute care hospital set active , prospective surveillance . The investigator ' secondary aim describe prevalence community-acquired symptomatic asymptomatic influenza upon hospital admission incidence asymptomatic symptomatic nosocomial influenza among inpatient ; ass transmission dynamic symptomatic influenza infection acute care ; study incidence asymptomatic symptomatic influenza , absenteeism ( i.e . absent work due influenza ) , presenteeism ( i.e . present work despite influenza infection ) associate influenza , compliance infection control recommendation prevent spread influenza acute care HCW . The investigator plan enroll 1,260 inpatient 180 HCW medical ward University Hospital Zurich prospective study two consecutive influenza season order detect least one transmission event asymptomatic individual shed influenza virus . Flocked mid-turbinate nasal swab collect daily consent inpatient start day admission two day discharge HCW influenza ( winter ) season analyze influenza A B use polymerase chain reaction . Simultaneously , sign symptom influenza infection ( include cough , sore throat , fever &gt; 37.8°C , nasal congestion , weakness , headache , loss appetite myalgia ) well contact pattern inpatient HCW record . Reconstruction influenza transmission chain base phylogenetic analysis derive next-generation sequence data epidemiological contact tracing .</brief_summary>
