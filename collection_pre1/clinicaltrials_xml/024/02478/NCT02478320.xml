	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn ilorasertib ( ABT-348 ) help control CDKN2A-deficient cancer . CDKN2A deficiency type mutation ( genetic change ) . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Ilorasertib ( ABT348 ) Patients With CDKN2A Deficient Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You take ABT-348 mouth 2 time day Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle . The first dose take day call Dose 1 , second dose take day call Dose 2 . You take Dose 1 ( early dose ) ABT-348 4 ounce ( Â½ cup ) water . You fast ( eat drink anything except water ) 8 hour take dose . You need fast dose eat food may affect level study drug able enter system . You allow light snack 2 hour Dose 1 , may eat anything like 4 hour dose . You take Dose 2 ( later dose ) close possible 6 hour first dose , less 6 hour first dose . You need fast Dose 2 . You may eat drink normally around dose . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle , Days 8 15 Cycles 1 2 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You EKG ( Day 1 Cycle 2 ) . For Cycle 3 , EKGs repeat every 3 cycle ( Cycles 6 , 9 , 12 , ) . On Day 1 cycle , urine collect routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond , become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Every 8 week , chest x-ray , bone scan , MRI/CT PET/CT check status disease . You may able tests/procedures perform local lab , clinic , doctor 's office closer home . The result test send study doctor review . The study doctor research staff discus option detail . Length Study Drug Administration : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You participation study last dose study drug . This investigational study . ABT-348 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 65 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
