	<brief_summary>Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) disease poor prognosis include 5-year overall survival ( OS ) app . 20 % entire population . In particular , outcome elderly patient AML dismal majority patient die within first year diagnosis . This also treatment option elderly patient AML significantly differ patient young age . In fact , comorbid condition common among elderly heart disease , renal insufficiency vascular disease thus influence ability withstand intensive therapy . Elderly patient also likely young patient develop severe , life threaten infection course treatment . In addition infectious complication , hemorrhage due severe thrombocytopenia responsible morbidity mortality considerable amount patient . Compared young AML patient , elderly individual AML display high incidence poor-prognosis karyotype , precede myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , great expression protein involve intrinsic resistance chemotherapeutic agent . As result conventional anthracycline base chemotherapy infrequently use patient age 65 year . Based recent randomize trial ( Kantarjian et al . 2012 ) low-intensity epigenetic therapy decitabine ( DAC ) become first-line standard care European country include Germany . Nevertheless , even treatment 1-year OS approximately 30 % . Furthermore , severe thrombocytopenia main side effect therapy prevent adequate continuation treatment crucially treatment success . Supportive care platelet transfusion effective primarily short period often require hospitalization therefore lower quality life patient palliative situation . Therefore , patient could benefit approach aim increase platelet count combine use DAC oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist like eltrombopag ( EPAG ) . This could allow good adherence DAC therapy prevent dose delay due prolong thrombocytopenia . Additionally , potential antileukemic effect EPAG could also beneficial AML patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study Decitabine With Without Eltrombopag AML Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DELTA-trial design two-arm , double-blind , multicenter randomized-controlled phase- II study EPAG placebo combination standard-dose DAC treatment concomitant medication subject least 65 year age AML eligible intensive chemotherapy plan therapy Decitabine ( DAC ) . Patients randomize 1:1 experimental study arm control study arm . EPAG 200 mg ( 100 mg East Asian patient ) daily select start dose study regimen investigate safe potentially effective increase platelet count patient AML . Concomitant medication DAC accord european label summary product characteristic . There dose adjustment EPAG depend platelet count obtain day 1 plan DAC cycle . Concomitant medication Decitabine ( DAC ) 20 mg/m2 i.v . 30 minute day 1-5 cycle . One cycle last 28 day . Patients receive medication long benefit treatment absence relevant adverse event indicate treatment discontinuation ; maximum 12 cycle . During Follow Up ( 4 year ) patient survival first treatment change observe .</detailed_description>
