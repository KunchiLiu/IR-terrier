	<criteria>Men localise prostate cancer high risk recurrence deem suitable external beam radiation therapy . 1 . Pathological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate , judge high risk recurrence base follow ( accordance International Society Urological Pathology ( ISUP ) Consensus 2005 : Gleason score 810 OR Gleason score 4+3 AND clinical T2b4 AND PSA &gt; 20ng/mL OR N1 disease ( involvement lymph node bifurcation common iliac artery ) define radiologically great 10mm short axis use standard CT MRI , biopsy proven 2 . Age ≥18 year 3 . Adequate bone marrow function Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥100g/L White Cell Count ( WCC ) ≥ 4.0 x 109/L platelet ≥100 x 109/L 4 . Adequate liver function : Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; 2 x ULN bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) , ( bilirubin 1.5 2 x ULN , must normal conjugated bilirubin ) . 5 . Adequate renal function : calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30 ml/min ( CockcroftGault ) 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 7 . Study treatment plan able start within 7 day randomisation . 8 . Willing able comply study requirement , include treatment , attend require assessment 9 . Has complete baseline HRQOL questionnaires UNLESS unable complete literacy limit vision 10 . Signed , write , inform consent 1 . Prostate cancer significant sarcomatoid spindle cell neuroendocrine small cell component 2 . Involvement lymph node superior common iliac bifurcation , and/or outside pelvis ( distant lymph node ) . Lymph node involvement define histopathological confirmation , short axis measurement &gt; 10mm standard imaging ( CT MRI , PET ) . 3 . Any contraindication external beam radiotherapy 4 . History seizure condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior cortical stroke significant brain trauma ) . loss consciousness transient ischemic attack within 12 month randomization significant cardiovascular disease within last 3 month : include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , ongoing arrhythmia Grade &gt; 2 , thromboembolic event ( e.g. , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism ) . Chronic stable atrial fibrillation stable anticoagulant therapy allow . 5 . Evidence metastatic disease : minimum imaging require Computed tomography scan ( CT ) / Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Whole Body Bone Scan ( WBBS ) . If equivocal bone scan , followup plain film require show NO evidence cancer cover CT/MRI 6 . PSA &gt; 100 ng/mL 7 . History another malignancy within 5 year prior randomisation except nonmelanomatous carcinoma skin ; , adequately treat , nonmuscleinvasive urothelial carcinoma bladder ( i.e . Tis , Ta low grade T1 tumour ) . 8 . Concurrent illness , include severe infection might jeopardize ability patient undergo procedure outline protocol reasonable safety Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection exclusion criterion control antiretroviral drug unaffected concomitant enzalutamide . 9 . Presence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule , include alcohol dependence drug abuse ; 10 . Patients sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form barrier contraception . 11 . Use hormonal therapy androgen deprivation therapy , include enzalutamide , except follow setting : Use LHRHA ( without antiandrogens ) less 30 day prior randomisation trial . 12 . Bilateral orchidectomy radical prostatectomy 13 . Prior brachytherapy radiotherapy would result overlap radiotherapy field 14 . Participation clinical trial investigational agent treatment prostate cancer diseases . 15 . Major surgery within 21 day prior randomisation 16 . Known gastrointestinal ( GI ) disease GI procedure could interfere oral absorption tolerance enzalutamide , include difficulty swallow tablet</criteria>
