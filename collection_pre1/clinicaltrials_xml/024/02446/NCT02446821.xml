	<detailed_description>Up 250 subject consent , screen VeraCept place , goal 2240 evaluable cycle 12 month . It plan 225 250 subject within 18-35 year age range , total 2015 evaluable cycle . The remain 25 subject within 35-40 year age range . Follow-up : Physical assessment ( office visit ) occur week 6 , 13 , 26 52 placement , monthly telephone contact . For subject wish continue study device use 12 month , follow-up office visit occur every 6 month . Additional visit conduct necessary safety issue . Follow-up early study device removal : Subjects request VeraCept removal become pregnant follow pregnancy subject change mind try get pregnant . All subject VeraCept remove prior 12 month , reason , require use alternative contraceptive first two week follow removal . Progestin-only pill provide sponsor contraceptive option time unless subject category 4 condition precluding use .
