	<brief_title>A Study Anti-PD1 ( Nivolumab ) Therapy Pre- Post-operative Therapy Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer ( ADAPTeR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) diagnose around 8500 patient annually UK . Approximately one third patient present metastatic disease RCC spread organ . The mainstay treatment patient systemic drug therapy , surgery remove primary kidney tumour ( i.e . nephrectomy ) may also provide clinical benefit . There standard preoperative systemic drug therapy metastatic RCC , preoperative therapy use widely treatment cancer type . This approach several potential advantage include shrink tumour help improve surgical outcome aid identification appropriate postoperative Drug therapy . Over last 10 year several agent demonstrate promising activity RCC include monoclonal antibody therapy nivolumab . This novel immunotherapy work block immune cell receptor ( program death1 ( PD1 ) ) cancer otherwise utilise evade individual immune system attack . This study investigate use nivolumab therapy preoperative treatment patient metastatic RCC nephrectomy plan . A total 19 patient recruit Royal Marsden Hospital Patients treat nivolumab 8 week prior surgery , nivolumab therapy restart continue time patient receive overall clinical benefit . The primary aim study assess safety strategy , aim assess clinical effectiveness . This also unique opportunity investigate way nivolumab work identify predictor treatment response . To achieve patient ask provide biopsy sample RCC pre &amp; post nivolumab treatment nephrectomy tissue research use , alongside additional blood &amp; urine sample .</detailed_description>
