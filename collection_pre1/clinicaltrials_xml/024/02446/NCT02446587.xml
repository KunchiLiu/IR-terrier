The study aim evaluate prospectively different selection methodology endovascular therapy , compare identify method provide high predictive ability selection patient IAT devise formula predict patient ' outcome . This study enroll patient base recent AHA guideline ( July 2015 ) regard treatment patient acute ischemic stroke large artery occlusion anterior circulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimizing Patient 's Selection Endovascular Treatment Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improving reperfusion status effective therapeutic approach patient acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) due large artery occlusion ( LAO ) . Intra-Arterial Therapy ( IAT ) mean mechanical thrombectomy and/or chemical fibrinolysis adopt worldwide recanalize LAO stroke . IAT standard care AIS patient LAO base result five randomized clinical trial . However , trial implement different image methodology patient treatment IAT . Specially , trial design use one another selection methodology without know may superior effective select patient may may benefit intervention . Decisions pursue IAT clinician-dependent rest upon number different factor may differ one center another even center one treat physician another . The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score ( ASPECTS ) demonstrate utility select candidate recanalization strategy use simple noncontrast head CT ( NCCT ) . Numerous study suggest utility magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , CT angiography ( CTA ) CT perfusion identify patient poor outcome thrombolysis . However , current widely practice selection methodology never test one another context prospective trial evaluate sensitivity , specificity superiority , opinion ( share many treat vascular neurologist ) , major question ask daily basis treat physician . Furthermore , prognostication inform stroke patient ' family chance good outcome Intra-Arterial Therapy crucial depend large extent clinical imaging variable utilized prior IAT well success intervention .</detailed_description>
