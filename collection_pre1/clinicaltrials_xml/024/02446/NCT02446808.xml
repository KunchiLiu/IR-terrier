	<brief_title>Intraoperative Nerve Monitoring During Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This single surgeon , single institution prospective post-market study patient undergo robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy ( RALP ) intraoperative nerve monitoring pelvic nerve use ProPep Nerve Monitoring System . The treatment group consist 80 subject ( 69 anticipate evaluable ) undergo RALP intraoperative nerve monitoring ( IONM ) . This compare consecutive group contemporary control cohort patient underwent RALP without nerve monitoring single surgeon . Baseline Evaluations Data Collection : Pre-operative baseline evaluation data collection use determine eligibility enrollment document subject clinical status prior surgical procedure . This information record Screening case report form ( CRF ) . The following data collect screening/baseline : - Medical History include Gleason score biopsy , clinical stage ( cT , TNM 2002 ) ; - Physical examination ; - Demographic information ; - Current symptom ; - Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Clinical Practice ( EPIC-CP ) Questionnaire ; - SHIM Questionnaire ; - Use drug erectile dysfunction ; - Confirmation inclusion exclusion criterion . Surgical Procedure The surgical procedure complete accord site-specific standard . The following general overview surgical procedure study . The daVinci Surgical System must use . Additional instrumentation necessary perform procedure determine surgeon . The Pep Electrode Introducer facilitate introduction needle electrodes pelvis . The electrode initially place levator muscle near apex prostate area nerve bundle prior pedicle dissection identify perineal branch pudendal nerve . Prior posterior dissection apex prostate , needle electrode remove levator muscle move external urethral sphincter identify deep ( muscular ) branch perineal nerve . Action potential measure Pep Monitor . Signals induce nerve ( ) interest stimulate tissue surround nerve ( ) along presumed nerve pathway low level electrical current . The low level current deliver conventional bipolar instrument use robotic surgery deliver close nerve trigger action potential nerve display Pep Monitor . The Pep Control Switch use switch bipolar instrument cautery mode stimulation mode . The close bipolar instrument nerve locate , large amplitude action potential displayed Pep Monitor . Nerves identify device prior pedicle apical dissection establish nerve location . Nerve monitoring may use course dissection confirm nerve location . Post-dissection reading collect specimen removal confirm integrity preserve nerve tissue end case . During procedure hospital discharge follow data point collect : - Type nerve spar - none , partial , bilateral ; - Prostate size ; - Estimated blood loss transfusion ( ) ; - Method dissection ( transperitoneal anterior , posterior , extraperitoneal , lymph node dissection ) ; - Gleason score radical prostatectomy ; - Pathological stage ( nT ) ; - Positive surgical margin rate ( PSM ) ; - Total robotic surgical time ; - Total time device deployment ; - Hospital admission / discharge date ; - Adverse event . Postoperative care accord site-specific standard care . Follow-up Evaluation Data Collections : Subjects follow post-operatively catheter removal ( typically 1 week ) , 1 month ( ±2 week ) , 3 month ( ±3 week ) , 6 month ( ±1 month ) , 12 month ( ±1 month ) follow procedure . Data collect appropriate follow-up Case Report Forms ( CRFs ) . The CRFs follow-up data collection point supply subject upon discharge hospital follow procedure . Research assistant call subject week prior due date remind subject fill mail back ( via pre-addressed , stamp envelope supply CRFs ) appropriate CRF . Site specific standard care follow post-operatively . The following data test complete follow-up visit : - Current symptom ; - Modified EPIC-CP Questionnaire ( question 3 4 ) ; - SHIM Questionnaire ; - Use drug erectile dysfunction ; - Adverse event ( AE ) . Contemporary Control Cohort : As procedure prospective cohort standard care investigator institution , investigator measure contemporary control cohort prospective cohort . Each prospective subject match two select subject contemporary control cohort biopsy Gleason score ( 6 vs. 7 vs. 8-10 ) , nerve-sparing status ( yes/no ) , type nerve sparing ( unilateral bilateral ) age ( within 5 year ) . The contemporary control cohort draw consecutive patient undergone RALP previous two year ( 2012-2014 ) IONM . The investigator record AEs contemporary control cohort investigator interested collect AEs data potentially relate use IONM .</detailed_description>
