	<brief_title>Dose Finding Study Bruton 's Tyrosine Kinase ( BTK ) Inhibitor , Ibrutinib ( PCI-32765 ) Plus Lenalidomide / Rituximab Relapsed Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma ( MCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) relatively rare subtype ( 3 % 6 % ( Zhou , 2008 ) mature B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , median age diagnosis mid late 60 's , male predominance ( 3/1 ) typically advanced stage presentation though 1/3 patient truly symptomatic baseline ( Armitage , 1998 ) . Although significant controversy remain management MCL , would agree challenge associate MCL , particularly poor result standard chemotherapy frequent chemoresistance push community innovative active clinical research . Hence median OS clearly improve last 3 decade ( 2-3y &gt; 5y ) ( Goy , 2011a ) , thanks deeper response obtain intensive regimen young patient ( early CR translate clearly well outcome ) also good salvage therapy MCL lymphoma 4 new biologicals approve ( 3 US 1 EU ) .</detailed_description>
