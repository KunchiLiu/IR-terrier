	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Objective 1 : Test efficacy daily egg consumption six month macro- micronutrient status young child indigenous community Ecuador . 1a . Measure serum concentration micronutrient biomarkers : choline ; betaine ; vitamin B12 . 1. b . Measure serum concentration macronutrient biomarkers : lipid ( total free esterify ) ; amino acid . Objective 2 : Characterize attitude , belief , use egg complementary feeding period . 2. . Describe exist attitude , belief , use egg young child diet Ecuador . 2b . Monitor acceptability tolerance daily egg consumption among young child . 2c . Assess willingness caregiver prepare give egg daily young child . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Globally , 165 million child affect stunt arise part macro- micronutrient deficiency complementary feeding period ; define 6 24 month age . An estimated 200 million child meet developmental potential part poor nutrition , particular , nutrient intake inadequacy . Eggs provide several critical nutrient know miss diet young child live poor country , yet largely underutilized infant young child nutrition . Eggs provide essential fatty acid , protein , many critical micronutrient level comparable animal source food , relatively affordable . Eggs consider perfect protein source amino acid profile protein compare . Eggs also highly concentrated choline , important precursor acetylcholine neurotransmitter synthesis , phospholipid need cell-membrane signaling , methyl-group donation homocysteine production pathway . The evidence adverse consequence choline deficiencies come largely animal study , though study show association choline metabolites negative health development outcomes child . Only one study show egg consumption among young child improve counseling . Eggs contribute dietary diversity . They one three animal source food group together flesh food dairy product , include seven food group use assess indicator minimum dietary diversity WHO Indicators assess infant young child feeding practice . However , underused diet young child relative potential improve child nutrition , particularly many African country even Latin America Caribbean . Egg consumption precede day among child 6 8.9 month age 7.3 % , 15.8 % 22.8 % Africa , Asia Latin America , respectively . Among child 12 23.9 month age , consumption increase 13.4 % Africa , 33.0 % Asia 41.8 % Latin America Caribbean . All evidence date suggest egg underutilized complementary food relative potential improve young child nutrition , particular , level key macro micronutrient . Research test efficacy dietary egg intake improve child nutrition develop country need . It also need understand attitude , belief use eggs complementary feeding period . Significance . Despite potential egg improve young child nutrition , knowledge randomize controlled trial test efficacy egg consumption improve micronutrient status young child live develop country little evidence egg-related intervention . There also limit evidence attitude , belief , use egg mother caregiver complementary feeding period . Therefore , propose study fill important gap literature examining , randomize control trial , effect egg consumption serum concentration micronutrient biomarkers : B12 ; choline ; betaine macronutrient biomarkers : lipid ( total free esterify ) ; protein nutrition young child poor rural area Ecuador . Through qualitative research propose study also shed light attitude , belief , use egg mother caregiver complementary feeding period . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN &amp; METHODS University San Francisco Quito ( USFQ ) coordinate field activity . A randomized control trial parallel design apply . A total 180 mother-infants pair enrol study : 90 control group ; 90 egg intervention group . Inclusion criteria infant include : age 6-8 mo ; healthy ( fever , congenital heart condition , egg allergy ) ; singleton birth ; severely malnourish [ weight-for-length z ( WLZ ) &gt; -3 ) . There 180 mother mother available , caregiver infant ( father , grandparent , aunts/uncles , sibling , etc . ) enrol . Participants ( recruitment , screening , consent process ) . Mothers/primary caregiver child recruit Pastocalle Parish Cotopaxi Province Ecuador , formative research conduct ensure sufficient number infant age category . There roll admission process one-year period ensure sample size reach , potentially extend recruitment adjacent parish . Participants recruit participatory approach , support local leader active involvement community stakeholder . There initial stage recruitment field team build rapport caregiver use standardized technique . Mothers ( primary caregiver ) approach invited participate child study . Study staff verbally explain rationale study , study procedure risk benefit , invite mother participate child . Eligibility screen occur . Screening question pose mother/primary caregiver include : - How old ? - What child 's birthday ? - Is child healthy , without fever congenital heart condition , severely malnourish ? - Does child reaction eat egg , rash , hive , difficulty breathing ? - Was birth child singleton birth ; he/she twin triplet , etc . If primary caregiver report child malnourish and/or child appearance thinness symptom edema , weight length child measure weight-for-length Z score determine WHO Growth Standards ( 2006 ) . Mothers primary caregiver child give write informed consent statement Spanish read sign , indicate consent consent behalf child . If mothers/primary caregiver less 18 year age , informed consent process seek parent guardian . Participants limit literacy offer option statement read . Caregivers invite ask question nature study time . A potential participant approximately one week decide whether participate thus , opportunity discuss family friend . Study field procedure . Children randomize computer-generated number sequence program one two comparison group 1:1 ratio : 1 ) control ; 2 ) egg supplementation . The baseline survey first administer mothers/primary caregiver community center , health care post nursery assign date . Household level socioeconomic , demographic , water , hygiene , sanitation information collect . Child dietary intake data collect use food frequency questionnaire commonly use complementary food , supplement targeted question child household egg consumption pattern . Morbidities assess use two-week recall , particular focus respiratory infection give high prevalence population symptom might associate egg allergy . Anthropometric measure child length weight take use international protocol . Phlebotomists experience well-equipped laboratory Ecuador , NETLAB , collect 3 ml blood child . A numbing cream use child . A weekly supply egg give mother egg supplementation group instruction give child one egg per day . Additional message communicate regard hygiene practice egg handle preparation . Eggs require refrigeration , need store cool location . Mothers/caregivers control group provide voucher 6 month eggs completion intervention study . All mother receive attendance card track participation study event include baseline endline visit qualitative assessment appropriate . At completion study , mother receive small personal care gift ( lotion perfume ) appreciation contribution . Motivational workshop periodically hold study coordinator team receive feedback participant continue provide rationale study participation . These workshop effectively engage caregiver study minimize losses-to-follow-up . As well , regular meeting community leader health worker hold communicate dialogue study progress finding . Eggs purchase locally Pastocalle distribute family weekly basis study team . ( The Food Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) potentially support USFQ implement poultry development project could link study . With technical support Ministry Agriculture extension worker , family Pastocalle receive raise chicken lay egg . ) Eggs study purchase household already establish project egg production develop Parish Council support individual disability . The study coordinator enumerator team contact mothers/primary caregiver lose follow-up mobile phone , visit , family member friend , order encourage return study collect information reason leave study . Nutrient biomarkers : Nutrient biomarkers assess study include vitamin B12 , choline , betaine , lipid amino acid . NETLAB Quito , Ecuador responsible : 1 ) collect blood sample ; 2 ) processing complete extraction process choline/betaine , lipid amino acid ; 3 ) shipping sample Washington University Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility ; 4 ) complete assay vitamin B12 . Trained phlebotomist travel Pastocalle surround parish periodically collect blood sample ( 3 mL child ) . The ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) plasma obtain collect blood Vacutainer Tubes mark participant ID number . The sample place ice transport NETLAB facility Quito . Samples process extraction complete choline , betaine , lipid , amino acid . For choline betaine analytes , aliquot plasma mixed acetonitrile contain d9-choline d9-betaine . The acetonitrile extract centrifuge , supernatant transfer micro-centrifuge tube , dry completion nitrogen gas . The micro-centrifuge tube label participant ID # date collection . An extraction process also complete processing lipid amino acid . These extract sample ship dry ice Washington University Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility St. Louis , MO Globalex ship company . The choline betaine assay test use LC/MS/MS protocol ( Appendix 1 ) . The remain sample aliquot frozen -80 degree C. Vitamin B12 later test use competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay solid phase . Qualitative research . Similar qualitative research technique apply use Focused Ethnographic Studies ( FES ) . The qualitative method base ground theory . Grounded theory unique form qualitative analysis inductive orientation construct theory systematic analysis collect data . In-depth interview focus group conduct mother , grandmother , caregiver , well local health care provider , community leader , egg producer understand attitude , perception use eggs young child nutrition . Structured observation conduct homestead consent caregiver child care center examine environmental factor , chicken rearing practice , complementary food storage egg preparation feeding practice . Additionally , follow combination three method analysis collect qualitative data : coding three stage ; abductive reasoning ; scheme generation . Of three , core method cod three stage . First , open cod identifies basic concept individual response . Second , axial coding develop generation category property emerge pattern response produce relation category property . Third , selective coding integrates refine main topic interrelation . Coding do USFQ , support investigator UCD PAHO triangulate quality control . Data management . USFQ responsible data management data collect Pastocalle NETLAB ( UC-Davis ) , Washington University responsible data generate Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility . Data entry initiate early continue throughout study minimize error increase likelihood accurate comprehensive reporting . When potential error miss data identify , manager inquire enumerator caregivers/mothers either provide appropriate response explanatory note data set . Double data entry conduct sub-set survey check entry error . Sample size statistical analysis . Sample size estimate base hypothesize change ( difference-in-difference control ) plasma vitamin B12 concentration 59.4 pmol/L 6 month period base previous finding vitamin B12 supplementation variability vitamin B12 status among infant . This nutrient select sample size calculation sufficient data available estimate variability potential effect egg consumption contrast nutrient study . We estimate require 90 child per group assume 20 % attrition rate . Descriptive statistic first apply examine characteristic sample , primary secondary outcome . Univariate test , include chi square t-tests , apply compare characteristic across trial arm examine cross-sectional difference outcome variable baseline endline . Longitudinal modeling primary biomarker outcome ( continuous serum/plasma nutrient concentration marker ) secondary growth ( LAZ , WAZ , WLZ ) morbidity outcome ( day diarrhea ) conduct use generalize least square ( GLS ) random effect . Logit model apply examine adjust odds threshold outcome ( nutrient deficiency , stunt , underweight , waste , respiratory infection , etc. ) . All inference analyse efficacy egg use intention-to-treat . Quantitative data analysis perform STATA software ( version 11.1 ; StataCorp , College Station , TX ) . For qualitative data analysis , interview transcript upload Nvivo10 software cod theme . Top-line theme sub-divided detailed category accord participant ' response interview . Analyses categories theme reveal pattern interview data form basis qualitative finding . A framework matrix analysis subset interview two study arm analyze key theme apply investigate systematic difference response across study arm . To measure micronutrient intake normative level adequacy , full probability approach use . This method allow comprehensive estimate inadequacy risk across entire distribution intake compare simple cut-point approach intake threshold level estimate . Child micronutrient intake standardize subtract estimate average requirement ( EAR ) reference distribution divide SD reference distribution . The result number compare standard normal distribution obtain probability inadequacy , area right standard normal curve , average across sample . Profile Target Population . The target population study infant age 6-8 month old Pastocalle Parish , populate mainly indigenous community , Cotopaxi Province Ecuador . Findings national health nutrition survey , Encuesta Natcional de Salud Nutriciόn ( ENSANUT-ECU ) show 25.3 % child age 0-5 year nationally , 42.3 % indigenous child stunt ( HAZ &lt; -2 ) . Other indicator study demonstrate nutritional vulnerability indigenous , young child Ecuador . Prevalences anemia ( 41.6 % ) , zinc deficiency ( 32.4 % ) , vitamin A deficiency ( 19.3 % ) exceed national average high 6-11 mo age category . The ENSANUT-ECU find high level nutrient intake inadequacy general population protein , iron , zinc . Rice comprise nearly one-third ( 32.8 % ) energy diet , relatively low level animal source food . USFQ conduct Chispaz Study examine efficacy micronutrient powder ; study carry Pastocalle . Thus , already understanding appreciation research community . Risks Benefits . There less minimal risk associate study . The risk allergic reaction egg low ; expect 1 2 % young child . The majority case mild consist hive soon consume egg . Children known egg allergy exclude study child display symptom allergic reaction refer treatment excluded future participation study . There small risk associate blood draw study . The study team collect sample well-trained safe handle human biologic specimen follow strict hygienic protocol relate usage glove , sterile equipment , alcohol swab cleanse area . A numbing cream similarly explore option minimize pain child psychological distress mother/caregiver . Interviews conduct caregiver private set maintain confidentiality . The child benefit directly participation study likely improvement nutritional status via consumption consumption egg , high nutritional quality , nutrient-dense food . The study involve delay intervention design , eventually participant opportunity receive egg intervention . Thus , participant opportunity benefit receipt high quality food . There potential benefit society term knowledge gain regard food-based , sustainable approach improve young child nutrition . Globally , nutrition program policy largely rely use single nutrient multiple nutrient supplementation , micronutrient powder , import process complementary food . This project aim test food-based approach , provide nutrient eggs highly bioavailable matrix appropriate young child . Further , egg purchase locally likely positive implication economic development region . Privacy confidentiality . The consent , interview , anthropometric measurement , blood draw process occur community center , health care post child nursery -as field team may determine appropriate location district parish . The space sufficiently large ensure confidentiality . Separate , private space setting designate interview data collection . Only question pertain child nutrition ask avoid unnecessary invasion privacy . Additional time allocate consent interview process allow mothers/primary caregiver ask additional question need . They also locate close proximity household facilitate convenient access mother caregiver . In case , field team visit directly participants home purpose mention . The informed consent form include mention possible use data blood sample future research , optional consent part mothers/caregivers . Two question include baseline survey , first ask mothers/caregivers agree data may use future research second , ask mothers/caregivers blood child may use future research . Data collect paper form store locked cabinet Instituto de Investigacion en Salud Nutricion ( ISYN ) office . All participant assign unique identifier write study form . Access personal identifying information limit among research investigator PI , senior research team , field team purpose participant follow-up tracking . Data enter study team USFQ .
