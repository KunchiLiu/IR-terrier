	<detailed_description>Most pediatric patient solid tumor respond initial high-dose , intensive therapy complete treatment remission . High-risk patient however , frequently recurrent disease treat ad hoc regimens early phase therapy little benefit patient . Metronomic therapy ( MC ) , define low dose continuous drug exposure , successfully test pediatric leukemias excellent result term improved outcome , toxicity profile , cost . MC apply solid tumor little success , implement usually relapse setting time high tumor burden disease resistance . This protocol 's overall objective improve historical outcome high risk pediatric patient remission initiate MC treatment completion front-line therapy . This protocol 1 ) treat patient minimal disease burden , 2 ) treat patient agent either previously incorporate front-line therapy give different manner , 3 ) design give outpatient set . The 4 agent take advantage target frequently disrupt signaling pathway , epigenetic abnormality , classical cell kill mechanism . An analysis cost undertaken help define part financial impact family health care system deliver therapy . The hypothesis protocol : Introduction metronomic treatment completion standard therapy patient high-risk , solid tumor remission improve time tumor progression compare historical control . The primary secondary goal ( specific aim ) protocol : To determine time tumor progression patient high-risk relapse solid tumor ; To define describe toxicity profile chemotherapy regimen ; To determine site ( ) relapse patient receive treatment ; To determine part cost delivering treatment ; finally understand add therapy impact quality life . Chemotherapy start within 6 week completion front-line treatment , documentation remission status fulfillment eligibility criterion . Documentation remission appropriate evaluation include history , physical examination , laboratory test radiographic image follow criterion initial staging , appropriate . There two study block . Each block 21 day duration consist 14 treatment day follow 7 rest day . The following block start day 22 cycle . There 10 cycle therapy ( approximately 60 week ) cycle define 42 day . Each block separate 1 week rest period ( chemotherapy ) patient evaluate disease status every two cycle therapy . Therapy continue 10 cycle patient relapse intolerant therapy . Block A consist bevacizumab weekly X 2 week 10 mg/kg , IV , day 1 8 , oral cyclophosphamide X 14 day 25 mg/m2 , day 1-14 . The maximum dose cyclophosphamide 50 mg. Block B consist temsirolimus weekly X 2 week , 25 mg/m2 , IV , day 22 29 , valproic acid , 5 mg/kg , mouth , day 22-35 . Valproic acid trough level maintain 75-100 ucg/mL adjust dos appropriate . The rest period day 15-21 36-42 . Blocks chemotherapy interrupt toxicity repeat time extend complete . The next block start toxicity improve grade II le two block treatment interrupt toxicity , dose reduction institute define protocol . Additionally , subject enrol MC control group complete three quality life ( PedsQL ) instrument three study time point : PedsQL Cancer Module , PedsQL Fatigue Module , Present Functioning scale . These indicator assess add therapy impact quality life . There investigational procedure , placebo involve protocol . The potential benefit protocol prolongation remission status patient minimal toxicity , anticipated hospitalization minimal additional cost care . Some patient may cure result treatment . Should study improve outcome group patient , benefit society would great . Outcome high risk patient stagnate least last 10 year additional high-dose chemotherapy unlikely improve outcome poor tolerability ( side effect ) . Studying cost associate treatment important lack information out-patient care cost general understand economic impact family society .</detailed_description>
