	<brief_summary>Background : - Painful stimulus cause change network brain region call Pain Matrix . But region respond many stimulus , pain . Researchers want understand different factor influence pain . They want test happen people expect different level pain receive treatment modify pain . They want see factor influence decision pain body responds . They also want compare pain response like taste vision . Objectives : - To good understand pain emotion process influenced psychological factor . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer age 18 50 . Design : - This study require 1 2 clinic visit last 1 3 hour . - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Some participant one magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . For MRI , participant lie table slide cylinder . The scanner make loud knock noise . They get earplug . - Participants heart activity record electrocardiogram . Their pulse , sweating , breathe monitor . - Some participant take taste test . Others may perform simple task . Others may receive pain arm , leg , hand . The pain come heat electric shock . Others may judge pain use topical pain-relieving cream . Some test may give MRI . - Participants fill questionnaire . - The study last 3 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Pain one important signal organism survival . The pathway transfer noxious input periphery central nervous system highly conserve across human animal model . In human , ultimate experience pain also highly influenced psychological factor . For example , placebo effect lead robust pain relief influence responses noxious stimulus human brain . However , psychological neurobiological mechanism psychological factor influence pain remain largely unknown . Pain modulate explicit belief treatment , prior experience learning , interpersonal process support patient-provider relationship , contextual factor relate treatment environment . In proposed series experiment , systematically investigate neural psychological mechanism mediate effect factor acute pain . We focus expectation , attention , emotion , conditioning/associative learning , social factor . These experiment principally use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) psychophysiological measurement , well behavioral assay self-reports . We examine effect different type pain-related expectation decision pain well response brain periphery . We also compare acute pain hedonic perceptual process . This allow u distinguish process unique pain perception specific pain , process involved perception decision-making across domain . Together , proposed series experiment aim elucidate psychological , neurobiological , physiological mechanism modulate pain . This , turn , identify target pain treatment inform mechanistic study alter pain processing clinical population . Study Population : We plan recruit 260 healthy volunteer age 18 50 . Design : The aim propose series experiment understand expectation , attention , emotion influence acute pain . We manipulate expectation noxious stimulus use associative learning verbal instruction , within-subjects between-groups design . We measure decision pain experience ( self-report ) well neural physiological response noxious stimulus cause pain . We combine computational modeling advance neuroimaging analysis isolate neural psychological mechanism mediate effect expectation , attention , emotion subjective pain . To determine specificity mechanism , compare acute pain modality ( e.g. , thermal pain versus shock-induced pain ) , contrast pain hedonic perceptual domain ( e.g. , taste ) . Outcome measure : Dependent variables experiment include decision pain and/or percept ( e.g. , sweetness taste ) measure visual analogue scale , reaction time , physiological response ( e.g. , skin conductance , pupil dilation ) , and/or BOLD activation region interest . We specifically interested process within network region know involved pain processing ( pain-processing network , PPN ) , well response prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , ventral striatum ( VS ) , amygdala . We hypothesize nociceptive stimulus pain rating associate unique pattern activation within PPN , whereas response region associate value , executive function , decision-making common across outcome .</detailed_description>
