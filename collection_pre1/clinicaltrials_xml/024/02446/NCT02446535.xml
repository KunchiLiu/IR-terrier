Primary outcome The primary outcome definition patient gold standard DW compare Clinical BIA DW . Two possible scenario : 1. Clinical BIA DW similar ( &lt; + 0.5 kg ) . Therefore , reciprocal validation two method specific patient obtain ; 2. Clinical BIA DW different ( &gt; + 0.5 kg ) . If BIA DW confirm follow six dialysis session , mean gold standard DW patient BIA DW .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Probing Dry Weight ( DW ) Bioimpedance ( BIA ) : Which Gold Standard Between Clinical DW BIA DW ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Probing dry weight ( DW ) largely dependent clinical subjective estimate recently . New bedside non-invasive tool develop aim provide objective information volume status guide physician quest DW . Among , bioimpedance ( BIA ) appear promising achievement goal . Resistance ( R ) capacitance tissue two basic property BIA . However , although impedance electrical property tissue directly use body composition analysis , commonly embed predictive equation derive correlation criterion measure body compartment . Very recently , test aim assess DW hemodialysis ( HD ) patient develop , `` resistance stabilization test '' ( REST ) . It base follow four item : 1. one daily and/or alternate day HD session last 6 hour ultrafiltration ( UF ) rate ≤ 0.5 kg/hour plan ; 2 . BIA measurement determine inject 800 microAmpere 50 kilohertz alternate sinusoidal current standard tetrapolar technique ( BIA 101 Impedance Analyzer ) . Resistance ( R ) record start begin HD session ( R0 ) , continuously , end 6-hour session ; 3 . DW define weight achieve flatten curve ratio R0/Rt ( R0 R time 0 Rt R give time HD session ) less + 1 % 20 minute presence ongoing UF , indicate decline extracellular volume ; 4. end 6-hour HD session R stabilization attain , new 6-hour HD treatment UF rate ≤ 0.5 kg/h plan BIA DW ( accord item 3 ) obtain . Aim study A study group create ( REST/Collaborative Study Initiative ) aim verify BIA-based DW ( BIA DW ) control truly superior current volume management HD patient . Protocol study DW determine clinical method ( Clinical DW ) gold standard definition : Clinical DW determine strict clinical surveillance attend physician . He help clinical score volume state symptom sign hypo- hypervolemia . The physician ask adjust DW candidate clinical score reach zero give number HD session BIA measurement . This Clinical DW compare BIA DW , obtain perform REST ; Phases study The protocol study include three sequential phase : 1. already mention , Clinical DW gold standard definition . Items form B must strictly apply . Form B must fill session session , score = 0 , index euvolemia , achieve ; 2 . The Clinical DW indicate score = 0 becomes target DW next standard HD session , BIA measurement perform : R value record continuously session ( Form C must fill ) . 3 . REST perform follow dialysis session ( detail give background section ) . As per protocol , dialysis session may one one , flatten curve ratio R0/Rt ( R0 R time 0 Rt R give time HD session ) less + 1 % 20 minute presence ongoing UF , obtain .</detailed_description>
