	<detailed_description>Background The rate hospital admission hyperbilirubinemia ( jaundice ) increase past 10 year . Jaundice condition cause elevated serum level bilirubin due increase bilirubin production normal production problem eliminate body . Serum level bilirubin excess 5 mg/dL signify clinical jaundice ; half full term infant experience level within first week life.1 It important health care provider distinguish infant experience physiologic jaundice part otherwise healthy development experience pathologic jaundice , treat aggressively , lead irreversible damage central nervous system.2 Since 2000 160 % increase number child readmitted hospital jaundice discharge hospital nursery.2 This dramatic increase believe associated change birth hospital culture newborns typically discharged 48 hour delivery bilirubin level still rise . Bilirubin level typically peak third fifth day life.3 The change hospital discharge procedure result circumstance parent may present medical care ED newborn start show symptoms jaundice . This trend observe despite implementation routine bilirubin screen many newborn nursery . Similar national trend , Children 's substantial increase ED evaluation jaundice ; 2012 , 274 neonate young 7 day old treated jaundice Children 's EDs . Families may seek care ED may establish relationship Pediatrician may believe child require intervention available ED setting . While patient ultimately admitted hospital monitoring treatment others send home phototherapy . At Children 's , approximately 61 % newborn evaluate jaundice admit hospital care.4 In 2004 American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) implement evidence-based recommendation treatment jaundice , incorporate infant 's serum bilirubin concentration also gestational age , postnatal age , symptom risk factor pathologic hyperbilirubinemia.5 , 6 The AAP recommendation basis current jaundice clinical algorithm . The main treatment option accord AAP guideline phototherapy , rare circumstance , exchange transfusion pharmacologic treatments.2 Phototherapy common treatment jaundice may use either home-based setting admission hospital.6 Phototherapy reduce serum bilirubin level change shape structure bilirubin one water soluble simplistically eliminate body urine stool.1 For patient fail phototherapy treatment level exceedingly high , use exchange transfusion option within hospital setting . Phototherapy successfully safely utilized home-based setting reduce likelihood hospital readmissions.6 Although pediatrician successfully utilized home-based phototherapy , ED utilization option limit access phototherapy equipment vendor ED provider knowledge criterion outpatient management . As result knowledge access gap , current ED care infant jaundice result variation care over-hospitalization infant may safely treat home . While AAP guideline educate physician importance evaluate infant 3 - 5 day age , lack adherence recommendation follow-up often delay . As example , Profit et al . evaluate large group urban suburban pediatrician determine adherence AAP recommendation follow-up healthy newborn infant â‰¥35 week gestational age . Only 37 % infant study see pediatrician within first 6 day life.7 This find consistent national trend show infant frequently present EDs symptom jaundice emerge lieu recommend screening.1 For example , 2007 , EDs across United States evaluate almost 46,000 patient neonatal jaundice . In order reduce time phototherapy decrease ED length stay8 face emergent presentation jaundice hospital implement clinical pathway . Gomez et al . develop implemented pathway use CDS tool accurately diagnose treat jaundice well mitigate cost associated readmission hospital . The author find clinical pathway useful clarify decision process clinician help educate clinician treatment option jaundice gain highlighting inconsistency routine protocols.9 Other author similarly report clinical pathway help reduce irregularity discrepancy neonatal jaundice care.10 Thus , available literature would support clinical pathway neonatal jaundice useful lead meaningful improvement patient care . Key strategy improve adherence current jaundice clinical pathway increase ED clinician knowledge improve access outpatient phototherapy . An electronic , Cerner-based CDS tool , one propose , would provide clinician information point care would incorporate ED workflow . This approach utilize algorithms develop evidence base guideline standardize treatment neonatal jaundice stratify patient diagnostic risk group base particular aspect history , physical examination laboratory data . The goal standardize care order promote safe , cost-effective well appropriate care infant . This especially important ED , high volume acutely ill patient management decision must make accurately quickly . This include rapid recognition risk serious complication condition kernicterus safely discharge home.3 Finally , order , delivery , set-up home phototherapy equipment must require minimal effort ED clinician . We propose leverage electronic health record ( EHR ) system streamline order well establish home nursing organization conduct home nursing visit address barrier adherence jaundice clinical pathway . Research Question Will clinical decision support tool jaundice promote appropriate use home photo therapy reduce hospital admission patient risk jaundice ? Design This prospective , interrupted time series trial . Methods We measure resource utilization ( i.e . laboratory use , hospital admission ) retrospectively 48 month pre-intervention child identify risk jaundice present care Children 's Emergency Departments . We implement jaundice-CDS 2-month period measure resource utilization 18 month post intervention . Rates unplanned ED hospital visit , use exchange-transfusion mortality monitor safety outcome . Jaundice-CDS compose two component . The first , MD Alert , trigger initial provider login cognitively prime ED provider toward use Jaundice-CDS . The second consist pre-populated order-set provide targeted recommendation guidance use photo-therapy criterion hospital admission . Both base currently accept pediatric guideline management condition . MD ALERT : A provider EHR-based alert trigger infant identify triage meet eligibility criterion . This alert serve remind clinician existence Jaundice order set , availability home nursing home photo-therapy . ORDER SET : When clinician begin process order laboratory test , encourage utilize Jaundice order-set . The order-set contain recommendation appropriate laboratory test obtain , criterion admission hospital , well pre-defined order obtain home nursing referral delivery home photo-therapy equipment . A link also provide `` bilitool.org '' , online resource calculate neonate risk jaundice . Analysis We use logistic regression ass , control relevant clinical factor , odds order specific laboratory test ( e.g. , CBC , BMP , Coombs , etc . ) group patient see implementation CDS compare odds order among patient arrive prior implementation CDS . Similar analysis laboratory test , use logistic regression estimate odds ratio admission home-based phototherapy among patient present ED jaundice symptom implementation CDS . We use linear regression compare total cost per encounter patient see ED implementation CDS total cost patient see ED post-implementation . In addition ED cost , total cost care include inpatient cost patient admit , include cost lab test . We also compare cost pre- post-implementation admit hospital discharge home .</detailed_description>
