	<detailed_description>The great saphenous vein ( GSV ) remain one commonly use conduit due ease harvest , availability versatility [ 1 ] Traditional harvesting GSV open vein harvesting , involve extend leg incision . This technique associate significant morbidity wound complication occur 2-24 % case . Minimally invasive technique endoscopic vein harvest ( EVH ) , therefore develop reduce post-CABG leg wound complication . Last time endoscopic vein harvest method choice many center allow reduction post-surgical complication compare open method . Although long-term graft patency follow EVH question cohort study report technique safe effective . The possibility use lymphoscintigraphy evaluation lower limb lymphatic system vein harvest coronary artery bypass surgery report . Nevertheless , state lymphatic system vein harvesting remain poorly study . Currently , share vision relate integrity quality conduit impact vein wall vein harvest . In connection , investigator study initial state venous conduit , interoperation damage vein postoperative wound complication use two method GSV harvesting .</detailed_description>
