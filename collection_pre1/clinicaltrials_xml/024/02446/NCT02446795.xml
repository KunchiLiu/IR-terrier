	<brief_summary>Advanced renal cell carcinoma invariably fatal , life expectancy 2-3 year since diagnosis . Sunitinib standard first-line treatment condition , associate multiple side effect , fatigue report 51-63 % patient .

	<brief_title>Isoquercetin Adjunct Therapy Patients With Kidney Cancer Receiving First-line Sunitinib : Phase I/II Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sunitinib oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFRs ) , platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFRs ) c-kit . Sunitinib first TKI approve first-line treatment advance kidney cancer ground result achieve phase III trial sunitinib vs. interferon Motzer et al . 2007 . In trial , improvement quality life modest compare advantage PFS response rate , relate multiple adverse event sunitinib . Sunitinib-induced toxicity include fatigue , hypertension , bone marrow toxicity , skin toxicity , gastrointestinal toxicity . Prevalence fatigue report 92 % administration chemotherapy agent , case kidney cancer patient treat sunitinib , fatigue grade report 51-63 % patient , approximately 7 % show grade 3-4 fatigue . According definition NCCN guideline , cancer-related fatigue distressing , persistent , subjective sense physical , emotional , and/or cognitive tiredness exhaustion related cancer cancer treatment proportional recent activity interfere usual functioning . There number general suggestion behavioral recommendation ( e.g . moderate physical activity ) easily effectively implement standard care treatment prevention fatigue cancer patient . Awareness recommendation still insufficient among physician . The use alternative strategy , include cognitive-behavioral therapy pharmacological agent may effective , present number barrier ( access health care worker appropriate expertise , reimbursement policy , patient 's attitude , drug adverse event ) limit impact routine clinical practice . The molecular mechanism sunitinib-related fatigue relate target inhibition multiple kinase involve cellular metabolism . In particular , sunitinib inhibits AMPK enzyme IC50 nanomolar range , thus interfere catabolic , energy-producing process , glycolysis lipid oxidation systemic level . Furthermore , sunitinib also inhibit GLUT 4-mediated intracellular transport glucose . For reason , sunitinib likely cause fatigue via mechanism different respect associate underlying cancer conventional chemotherapy agent . Of note , randomize , interventional trial ever conduct tackle fatigue kidney cancer patient treat sunitinib . The current management fatigue patient remain unsatisfactory present time . Quercetin naturally occur flavonol characterize phenyl benzo ( ) pyrone-derived structure , belong broad group polyphenolic flavonoid substance . While quercetin aglycone , naturally occur quercetin compound primarily glycoside , small quantity occur aglycone . In particular , isoquercetin 3-O- quercetin . Isoquercetin hydrolyze vivo form quercetin , reason biological effect quercetin isoquercetin pharmacodynamically identical , although isoquercetin comparatively much bioavailable quercetin . Quercetin isoquercetin FDA-registered nutritional dietary ingredient suitable consumption general population 2 g 600 mg day , respectively . For research purpose study , noteworthy quercetin stimulate AMPK vitro , increase GLUT 4 translocation cytoplasmic membrane micromolar concentration comparable possibly achievable oral administration . These biological effect could positively impact sunitinib-induced fatigue . Quercetin able reduce chemotherapy-induced fatigue mouse , healthy human , randomize , placebo-controlled study show supplementation 500 mg quercetin twice daily 7 day provide statistically significant 13.2 % increase bike-ride time fatigue . In conclusion , follow bullet point summarize background rationale study : 1. sunitinib main widely use first-line treatment metastatic kidney cancer cause fatigue approximately 50-60 % case ; 2. sunitinib-induced fatigue likely mediate GLUT-4 AMPK downregulation ; 3. fatigue negative impact quality life , increase treatment-related morbidity , responsible treatment delay interruption , dose reduction may ultimately reduce sunitinib efficacy ; 4 . Quercetin natural flavonol normally present food FDA-registered nutritional dietary ingredient general population 1 g per day . Isoquercetin quercetin derivative hydrolyze vivo quercetin , consider safe general population nutritional supplement dose 600 mg day FDA . The Institutional Review Board Dana-Farber Institution FDA recently approve experimentation two dose level isoquercetin , 500 mg 1000 mg , simultaneously test phase IIb part large phase II/III trial thrombosis prevention cancer patient ( ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT02195232 ) ; 5. significant negative pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic interaction treatment expect , vivo study show relevant pharmacokinetic interaction quercetin CYP-metabolized drug ; 6 . The dos employ study well maximum tolerate dose find phase I study test intravenous quercetin ( MTD : 1400 mg/m2 ) . In study , renal toxicity main dose limit toxicity ; 7. isoquercetin may reduce fatigue kidney cancer patient receive sunitinib basis molecular rationale , pre-clinical experimental model clinical data .</detailed_description>
