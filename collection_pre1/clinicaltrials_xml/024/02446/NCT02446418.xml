	<brief_summary>The combination FF , ICS VI , orally inhale LABA develop once-daily combination therapy long-term maintenance treatment asthma adult child &gt; =12 year age . Pivotal phase III study demonstrate safety efficacy FF/VI asthma . However , increasingly acknowledge randomised clinical trial tend highly control enrol highly select subject population expect prescribed medication post-approval . There need data representative population close 'real life ' condition , physician ability choose best treatment view individual subject adapt treatment subject ' characteristic response . This multi-center , open-label , randomize , parallel group study evaluate efficacy safety FF/VI compare two usual ICS/LABA fix combination ( fluticasone propionate/salmeterol [ FP/S ] budesonide/formoterol [ BUD/F ] ) subject persistent asthma , `` close real life '' setting . FF/VI administer once-daily ( QD ) via ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) FP/S BUD/F administer twice daily ( BID ) via DISKUS™ TURBUHALER™ DPI respectively . ELLIPTA new powder inhaler design easy use . The total duration subject participation approximately 6 month ( 24 week ) . ELLIPTA DISKUS register trademark GSK group company . TURBUHALER register trademark AstraZeneca .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Informed consent : Capable give sign informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . Gender Age : Male female subject age &gt; =18 &lt; =75years age Screening visit . Female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following Documented tubal ligation ; Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion ; Hysterectomy ; Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] estradiol level consistent menopause [ refer laboratory reference range confirmatory level ] ) ; Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list GSK Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) requirement 30 day prior first dose study medication Week 24 . GSK Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy FRP : This list apply FRP sex partner , prefer usual lifestyle subject continue abstinent penilevaginal intercourse long term persistent basis : Contraceptive subdermal implant meet Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP ) effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1percent rate failure per year , state product label ; Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet SOP effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 percent rate failure per year , state product label ; Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone ; Injectable progestogen ; Contraceptive vaginal ring ; Percutaneous contraceptive patch ; Male partner sterilization documentation azoospermia prior female subject 's entry study , male sole partner subject ; Male condom combine vaginal spermicide ( foam , gel , film , cream , suppository ) ; These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Type subject : Subjects document physician 's diagnosis asthma &gt; =1 year , unsatisfactorily control asthma ( ACT &lt; 20 Screening Randomisation visit ) treat ICS alone intend treated ICS/LABA maintenance therapy ; France Only : A subject eligible inclusion study either affiliate beneficiary Social Security category . Current Asthma Therapy : All subject must prescribe maintenance therapy receive ICS alone without LABA least 4 week prior Randomisation visit ; Other background asthma medication antileukotrienes theophylline permit alternative ICS alone , initiate least 4 week prior screen visit . Subject questionnaires Subjects must able complete questionnaire . History Lifethreatening asthma : Defined protocol asthma episode require intubation and/or associate hypercapnea , respiratory arrest hypoxic seizure within last 6 month Screening Randomisation visit . Subjects severe unstable asthma , ACT score &lt; 15 Visit 1 Visit 2 , and/or history repeat severe exacerbation ( 3/year ) and/or severe exacerbation previous 6 week Visit 1 Visit 2 . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) Respiratory Disease : A subject must current evidence diagnosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Screening visit . Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; =10 packyears screen [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g. , 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ) ] . Other diseases/abnormalities : Subjects historical current evidence uncontrolled clinically significant disease Screening Randomisation visit . Significant define disease , opinion Investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , would affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . Subjects history adverse reaction include immediate delay hypersensitivity intranasal , inhale , systemic corticosteroid LABA therapy component inhalation powder ( e.g. , lactose , magnesium stearate ) Screening Randomisation visit . In addition , subject history severe milk protein allergy , opinion Investigator , contraindicate subject 's participation also exclude . Investigational Medications : A subject must use investigational drug within 30 day prior Randomisation visit within five halflives ( t½ ) prior investigational study ( whichever longer two ) , ( unsure discus medical monitor prior screen ) . Chronic user systemic corticosteroid : A subject , opinion Investigator , consider chronic user systemic corticosteroid respiratory indication ( unsure discus medical monitor prior screen ) Screening visit . Subjects treat monoclonal antibody omalizumab mepolizumab Visit 1 . Treatment omalizumab mepolizumab allow study . Subjects involve clinical trial Screening visit . Affiliation Investigator Site : Is investigator , subinvestigator , study coordinator , employee participate investigator study site , immediate family member aforementioned involve study . Subjects plan move away geographical area study conduct study .</criteria>
