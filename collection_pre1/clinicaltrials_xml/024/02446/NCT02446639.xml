	<brief_summary>`` Troponin T ( TnT ) component contractile apparatus striate musculature . Although function TnT striate muscle find heart form TNT ( cardiac TnT ) differ significantly TnT skeletal muscle . Because high tissue specificity , cardiac TnT specific marker highly sensitive myocardial injury . Asymptomatic elevation troponins frequently find patient chronic renal failure stage V , present clinical sign acute electrical myocardial injury . Many study conduct recent year explain origin clinical significance elevation , result controversial : cardiac dysfunction , leave ventricular hypertrophy chronic inflammation . Besides effect dialysis session evaluate biological parameter different study together find Impact hemodialysis session value troponin Achieving dosages rate hypersensitive serum troponin T dialysis population , : - determine evolution TnT time characteristic patient rate varies - know evolution session , - identify possible criterion responsible variation direction increase / reduction - characterize patient whose base rate high 99 percentile absence clinical symptom could lead establish reference population specific normal value . The Purpose study evaluate serum troponin T hypersensitive dialysis population verify influence hemodialysis session , session parameter intradialytic event change serum troponin T hypersensitive hemodialysis session. ``</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current care study , single-center , uncontrolled , randomise , open prospective . Two hundred fifty patient hemodialysis / peritoneal dialysis 3 month may include study total period 7 month . Hemodialysis patient informed weekly routine visit . Regarding peritoneal dialysis patient , meet organize physician . And oral agreement patient collect second visit meeting . The protocol provide four follow-up visit : baseline , 4 week , 12 24 week . During visit , patient clinical examination measure serum troponin T. Blood sample realize usual condition center - hemodialysis patient : midweek instruct usual protocol center . - peritoneal dialysis patient : monthly routine consultation .</detailed_description>
