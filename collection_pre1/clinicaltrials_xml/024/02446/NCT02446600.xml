	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study olaparib cediranib maleate olaparib see well work compare standard platinum-based chemotherapy treat patient platinum-sensitive ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer come back . Olaparib cediranib maleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Cediranib maleate may stop growth ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer block growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , paclitaxel , gemcitabine hydrochloride , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether olaparib cediranib maleate olaparib effective standard platinum-based chemotherapy treat patient platinum-sensitive ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess time randomization first non-study , anti-cancer therapy , surgery death ( TFST ) single-agent olaparib combination cediranib olaparib relative standard platinum-based chemotherapy set recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . II . To assess time randomization second non-study , anti-cancer therapy , surgery death ( TSST ) single-agent olaparib combination cediranib olaparib relative standard platinum-based chemotherapy set recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . III . Assess effect secondary measure quality life , assess treatment side effect ( TSE ) function / well-being ( F/WB ) subscales NFOSI-18 , sensory neuropathy measure FACT/GOG-Ntx-4 , health utility measure Euro Quality Life-5 Dimension ( EQ-5D ) , single agent olaparib cediranib olaparib , compare standard platinum-based chemotherapy , set recurrent platinum sensitive ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients may treat one three regimen per investigator discretion . REGIMEN I : Patients receive carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . REGIMEN II : Patients receive carboplatin IV day 1 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . REGIMEN III : Patients receive carboplatin IV pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive olaparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive olaparib PO BID cediranib maleate PO daily ( QD ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
