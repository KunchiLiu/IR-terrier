	<brief_title>Fetal Cystoscopy Lower Urinary Tract Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients severe LUTO come clinical evaluation part standard clinical care Fetal Center Texas Children 's Hospital . Once diagnosis fetal severe LUTO confirm patient consider fetal intervention , patient invite participate present study . Fetal cystoscopy offer optional experimental procedure . The following information obtain standard clinical care visit usual : a. demographic ( maternal age , parity ) ; b. gestational age diagnosis LUTO ; c. fetal ultrasound finding include documentation cervical length , gestational age , fetal bladder size , bladder wall thickness , degree fetal hydronephrosis , amount amniotic fluid , fetal biometry ; d. fetal urinary biochemistry ; e. fetal echocardiogram finding . The standard management option fetal LUTO include expectant management , fetal vesico-amniotic shunt termination pregnancy accord law . These option offer patient first set management option gold standard . In addition , investigator group offer procedure alternative experimental option , full explanation experimental nature procedure , technical benefit difficulty , risk potential benefit procedure limit long-term outcome information . Those patient request participation present study inform , priori , select crossover arm reason fetal cystoscopic procedure possible . They elect fetal vesico-amniotic shunting perform prenatal expectant management even termination pregnancy ( part standard management fetuses LUTO ) . Participation study : Once patient deem eligible , prenatal standard management option offer first patient . Fetal cystoscopy offer investigational procedure evaluation . If patient opts fetal cystoscopy , explain procedure diagnostic therapeutic . In order prevent coercion , investigation procedure present patient manner option voluntary , patient chooses participate investigational procedure , clinical care affect . Informed consent participate present study obtain . We also include non-English speaking subject present study . We submit full Spanish consent via amendment IRB approval approval English consent . We enroll non-English subject receive final approval . The study flow demonstrate Figure 1 ( see attach document ) . Description fetal cystoscopy procedure ( experimental procedure ) : Fetal cystoscopy perform 16 0/7 25 6/7 week Pavilion Women - TCH . This procedure perform maternal local anesthesia sedation . In case , accord anesthesiologist 's indication , maternal epidural may perform . Fetal anesthesia perform ultrasound-guided injection fetal arm leg combination fentanyl ( 15µglKg ) , atropine vecuronium ( 0.5-2mg/Kg ) . Prophylactic tocolysis use patient protocol employ magnesium sulfate - 6 gram IV load dose follow 2 gram/hour continuous infusion 24 hour , follow nifedipine 10mg Q6 36 week gestation . Prophylactic antibiotic also use procedure use Cefazolin 2 g IV immediately procedure . Nafcillin inject amniotic cavity conclusion procedure . In case patient allergy cephalosporin , clindamycin 600 mg use alternative . Steroids fetal lung maturation give 24 25 6/7 week ( two dose 12 mg betamethasone give 24 hour apart , last dose give 48-72 hour procedure ) , procedure perform gestational period . The procedure perform percutaneously ultrasound-fetoscopic guidance . An 18G needle introduce fetal bladder maternal abdominal wall uterus ultrasound guidance . Using Seldinger technique 8-9Fr Cook trocar insert maternal wall towards fetal bladder . A curved Storz sheath 1.3 mm ( 11530AA , Karl Storz , Tuttlinglen , Germany ) 2.0 mm fetoscopy ( 26120BA , Karl Storz , Tuttlingen , Germany ) flexible ureteroscope introduce Cook catheter fetal bladder . After confirm trochar inside fetal bladder , urine sample collect renal function analysis . The fetoscope advance toward bladder neck dilate posterior urethra . If membrane-like obstruction urethral lumen see , diagnosis PUV confirm time valve fulgurated use Diode laser low energy ( 15-20W ) . If necessary , use guide-wire perforate valve . Fulguration valves perform cautiously laser fiber almost touch order avoid damage peripheral tissue . When valve completely disrupt , urine release patent urethra , result empty bladder . A transurethral shunt may place depend cause obstruction ( urethral stenosis ) . In addition , power Doppler apply confirm passage fluid patent urethra amniotic cavity . However , non membrane-like structure find , even fluid injection guide-wire , urethral atresia ( UA , US Prune Belly syndrome ) diagnose attempt perforate structure . A vesicoamniotic shunting placement perform situation depend patient 's consent prior surgery . The postsurgical care go follow standard prenatal care fetal vesico-amniotic shunting . The expected hospital course 72 hour also expect fetal vesico-amniotic shunting ; however , possible patient hospitalize complication preterm labor . The patient discharge home recommendation modify bed rest first 2 week post discharge , subsequently allow graduate moderate activity uterus quiescent . Patients return weekly basis clinical ultrasound evaluation . On ultrasound , fetal kidney , bladder thickness dilatation , amniotic fluid volume assess . Fetal Surveillance biophysical profile Doppler study begin 34 week Delivery mode perform base obstetrical management follow investigator clinical algorithm . The subject undergo fetal cystoscopy exactly postnatal routine ( standard care ) clinical follow-up provide infant LUTO . All infant LUTO followed-up pediatric urology nephrology service may need postnatal surgical intervention . At birth , clinical evaluation include renal ultrasound , void cysto-urethrogram ( VCUG ) well clinical laboratory examination serum creatinine , sodium , calcium , potassium chloride , urine analysis perform part standard clinical care . Information routine examination collect document .</detailed_description>
