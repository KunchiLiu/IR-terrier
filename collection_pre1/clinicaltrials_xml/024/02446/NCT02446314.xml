Participants may stop study treatment without state reason time study . In addition , participant withdrawn study : subject request discontinuation , he/she exhibit serious adverse event component test product , participant significantly violate inclusion exclusion criterion , intercurrent illness emerge and/or investigator 's opinion withdrawal appropriate best interest participant . If participant withdraws study , he/she encourage make final visit soon possible , irrespective reason withdrawal , complete final battery cognitive task . 1 . Screening : participant indicate wish join trial contact telephone brief screen session . The research associate ( RA ) give brief overview study ascertain interested volunteer willing participate entire duration study check fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion . Once confirmation suitability study confirm , RA schedule familiarization visit . 2 . Familiarization Visit : Volunteers ask attend Nutritional Psychology Unit University Reading receive detail explanation study participate research associate ask sign inform consent form study procedure start . A log keep identify participant sign informed consent form ( ICF ) participant allocate participant number . Once consent give , inclusion/exclusion criterion check vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate ) anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , BMI ) take .

Blood pressure heart rate also measure , food diary collect ( week 0 24 ) . They receive standard low-flavonoid breakfast complete battery cognitive task ( see ) . Subjects give intervention ( sufficient quantity next test session , blister pack , week 0 12 ) , request consume 2 capsule day . At week 24 , Yale Physical Activity Frequency Forgetting questionnaire also administer , weight measure . 4 . Control Visits ( week 6 &amp; 18 ) : These session take place time day suit participant . Participants attend laboratory University Reading collect next 6 week supply intervention . During visit check participant still fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion , informally check well-being , inquire whether adverse event , confirm change concomitant medication .
