	<detailed_description>1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 1.1 Background Due high incidence stroke , increase risk develop secondary ( e.g. , pain , depression , urinary tract infection , pressure ulcer , fall , seizure ) chronic condition ( e.g. , second stroke , CVD ) , high medical cost 1 , evolve healthcare system ( e.g. , reimbursement , length stay , staff productivity 2 , healthcare professional challenge explore develop innovative strategy continue achieve best clinical practice outcomes patient . Functional activity level typically low inpatient rehabilitation post stroke 3-6 , emphasize King colleague 7 report patient post stroke undergoing inpatient rehabilitation spend 76 % day bedroom 62 % inactive . Consequently , since dose functional activity ( amount active time and/or quantity repetition ) posit relate outcome 8-11 , optimal condition inpatient rehabilitation question . The literature clear low functional activity reflect low potential neuroplasticity . Consequently , novel feasible method provide high dos functional activity inpatient rehabilitation , realistically consider cost-effectiveness resource allocation 12 , important improve functional outcome post stroke 13 . 1.2 Rationale Protocol Early initiation therapy post stroke associate improved long-term outcome 14 , functional activity dose ( e.g. , activity time , number repetition ) first week inpatient rehabilitation predict gait velocity discharge length time independent walk 15 . Specifically , patient complete median number exercise repetition ( 703 ) first week inpatient rehabilitation experience quick recovery unassisted walk 15 . This lack activity significant issue inpatient rehabilitation overall recovery repetitive task practice argue drive neural plasticity follow stroke 16,17 . Specifically , grow body evidence indicate increased functional activity large volume practice inpatient rehabilitation require induce improve stretch reflex modulation increase neuromuscular activation 11 , thus lead meaningful neural adaptation recovery follow stroke 16 . However , current clinical practice 3-hours therapy inpatient rehabilitation ( standard care inpatient rehabilitation hospital ) may adequate facilitate neuroplasticity achieve optimal functional outcome 10 . This emphasized fact Medicare beneficiary stroke undergoing inpatient rehabilitation experience short LOS , worsen admission discharge function , few community discharge 18 . Therefore , objective proposal evaluate feasibility effectiveness implement novel intervention facilitate patient-directed activity individual undergo inpatient rehabilitation . The goal intervention increase repetition , stimulation , attention , therapeutic activity affect extremity trunk facilitate improve outcome follow stroke 17,19,20 . This achieve add 1.5-hours daily patient-directed activity individual schedule beyond 3-hours therapy provide clinician , thus increase daily therapeutic activity time 50 % . The activity include physical ( PT ) occupational therapy ( OT ) task ( see table 1 detail ) . The activity therapeutic nature , include typical activity patient would complete 3-hours therapy provide standard care , low intensity , include activity involve seat prone gym mat . It important note clinical team Baylor Institute Rehabilitation implement 1.5-hours additional daily therapy standard care since January 2014 . However , date collect effectiveness data clinical research team want demonstrate research project addition extra 1.5-hours daily therapy beneficial beyond 3-hours therapy currently provide standard care . Since start additional therapy January 2014 clinical team 25 patient successfully move rehabilitation patient adverse event . 2.1 Primary Objectives Pilot feasibility integrate novel patient-directed activity program inpatient rehabilitation follow stroke . Based guideline conduct priori pilot study assess aspect process ( e.g. , eligibility , randomization ) , resource ( e.g. , equipment , space ) , management ( e.g. , staff capacity data entry management ) , scientific basis ( e.g. , sensitive outcome measure ) intervention . Our work hypothesis patient-directed activity program successfully integrated patient clinical schedule . 2.2 Secondary Objectives To identify participation novel patient-directed activity program improve functional ability health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) patient post stroke . Our work hypothesis patient ' post stroke actively participate program manifest significant increase functional ability HRQOL discharge inpatient rehabilitation follow-up appointment within 6 month discharge compare control . 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 3.1 Study Design We use randomize controlled trial include stroke patient undergoing inpatient rehabilitation Baylor Institute Rehabilitation ( BIR ) . Participants randomize experimental ( patient-directed station program ) control group ( standard care ) .</detailed_description>
