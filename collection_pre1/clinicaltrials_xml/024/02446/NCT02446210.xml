	<brief_summary>The long‐term goal acquire scientific knowledge use develop mechanistic-driven intervention strategy aim restore upper lower-limb motor function individual cervical thoracic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The propose project examine cortical , corticospinal , spinal contribution bilateral hand arm muscle activity bilateral movement spinal contribution low limb muscle activity . By compare change different site within Central Nervous System ( CNS ) , investigator may also identify key mechanism might differentially affected injury , plasticity , training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If participant qualifies take part research study , ask participate 15-190 study visit , complete experimental procedure . These procedure break `` Phases '' complete order . Phase I Phase IIa include 2-30 total visit - approximately 2-3 hour measure arm finger strength ability move . Phase IIb include 2-30 total visit - approximately 2-3 hour , measure leg strength ability move . Phase IIIa include 40 total visit - approximately 2 hour , investigator evaluate participant 's ability use arm . The participant ask complete series task stack checker , turn card , squeeze device determine strong grip , see well able feel sensation surface skin . The investigator complete assessment pre-determined time study participation . Phase IIIb include 40 total visit - approximately 2 hour , investigator evaluate participant 's ability use leg . Assessments participant 's legs include walk around lab space , well bend ankle hip , well able feel sensation surface participant 's skin .</detailed_description>
