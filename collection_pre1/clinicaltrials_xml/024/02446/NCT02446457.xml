	<brief_title>Study Rituximab Plus Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) Subjects With Relapsed Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible study , receive rituximab pembrolizumab 21-day study cycle . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycle 2 , receive rituximab vein . The first infusion take 6-8 hour . After , infusion take 4 hour . On Day 2 Cycles 1 2 Day 1 Cycles 3-16 , receive pembrolizumab vein 1 hour . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , vital sign record . On Day 22 Cycle 2 , physical exam . On Day 1 Cycles 3-16 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Every 2 cycle , part sample also use check thyroid function . Every 4 cycle , part sample also use check status immune system . On Day 1 Cycles 5 , 9 , 13 : - Urine collect routine test . - You CT scan check status disease ( Cycle 5 ) . On Day 1 Cycle 8 , PET/CT scan check status disease . At time , doctor think need , may bone marrow biopsy aspirate and/or CT PET/CT scan check status disease . Length Study : You may take rituximab 2 cycle pembrolizumab 16 cycle . You longer able receive drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : After stop receiving study drug ( ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , PET/CT scan check status disease . Long Term Follow-Up : 30 day End-of-Treatment visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check thyroid function , check status immune system . - Urine collect routine test . Every 3 month 1 year every 6 month start new therapy , disease get bad , study end : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check thyroid function , check status immune system . - You CT scan check status disease . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma certain type leukemia . The combination drug treat FL investigational . The study doctor describe study drug design work . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
