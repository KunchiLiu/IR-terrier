	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose total bone marrow lymphoid irradiation give together chemotherapy donor stem cell transplant treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome acute leukemia . Total marrow lymphoid irradiation type radiation therapy target bone marrow blood , cancer , instead apply radiation whole body . Stem cell transplant use high dos chemotherapy radiation therapy , total marrow lymphoid irradiation , kill cancer cell , treatment kill normal cell well . After chemotherapy , healthy cell donor give patient help patient grow new blood cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Marrow Lymphoid Irradiation Chemotherapy Before Donor Transplant Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish safety determine maximum tolerate dose total marrow lymphoid irradiation give combination fludarabine ( fludarabine phosphate ) pre-post-transplant cyclophosphamide , condition haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) patient high-risk acute lymphocytic myelogenous leukemia intermediate/high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome . II . To evaluate safety regimen dose level assess adverse event : type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course , duration . III . To evaluate safety regimen dose level assess complication : include acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) , infection delay engraftment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , cumulative incidence ( CI ) relapse/progression , non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) +100 Days , 1 year 2 year . II . To characterize minimal residual disease bone marrow aspirate Days +30 , +100 , +180 post-transplant describe relation total marrow lymphoid irradiation ( TMLI ) dose level patient disease status . III . To describe kinetics immune cell recovery first year post-transplantation . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study TMLI . CONDITIONING : Patients undergo TMLI twice daily ( BID ) day -7 -4 -3 ( depend dose level ) . Patients also receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously ( IV ) day -7 -3 cyclophosphamide IV day -7 , -6 , 3 , 4 . TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplant day 0 . GHVD PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive tacrolimus* IV daily ( QD ) orally ( PO ) BID day 5-180 . Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily ( TID ) IV day 5-35 . Treatment tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil may continue presence active GVHD . *NOTE : Patients intolerant tacrolimus may receive cyclosporine . After completion study treatment , patient follow twice weekly 100 day , twice monthly 6 month , monthly patient immunosuppressive therapy without evidence GVHD , least yearly total 5 year .</detailed_description>
