	<brief_summary>This study evaluate performance EnLightTM LightPathTM Imaging Systems detect tumour lesion patient gastric , pancreas , bile duct duodenal cancer . EnLightTM use detect positron emission LightPathTM system detect Cerenkov Luminescence . Both emit Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) agent . The study also evaluate patient safety radiation safety EnLightTM , safety device operator surgical staff LightPathTM Imaging System .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study prospective , open-label , single-centre nature patient gastric , pancreas , bile duct duodenal cancer tumour excision surgery indicate . Patients give write informed consent screen study ( Visit 1 ) . Patients undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) whole body scan . Screening assessment , include PET scan , must perform less 60 day surgery may perform day surgery . On day surgery ( Visit 2 ) , subject 's blood glucose level measure . Subjects blood glucose level &lt; 12 mmol/l receive intravenous injection 2-5 Mega Becquerel/kg ( MBq/kg ) , maximum 300 MBq fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) prior surgery . During surgery le 120 minute injection FDG , primary lesion image use EnLightTM system determine margin status . Gastrointestinal tumour excision surgery perform accord standard care . The surgical cavity lymph node image EnLightTM system establish whether radioactive tissue remain . These result influence surgical clinical decision-making , remain standard care . The resected tumour excision specimen image LightPathTM Imaging System . The resected tumour excision specimen , addition , analyse accord standard care pathology . The surgeon surgical staff monitor external exposure ionize radiation mean dosimeter , position sensor surgery . Patients followed-up ( Visit 3 ) within 2 - 14 day window end surgery adverse event ( AEs ) . Those related use investigational device , PET image agent identify .</detailed_description>
