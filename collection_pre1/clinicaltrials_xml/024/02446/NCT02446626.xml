	<brief_summary>Background : The common tick-borne illness United States , Lyme disease cause Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmit people Ixodes scapularis tick . Most case Lyme disease cure antibiotic , patient continue experience symptom despite absence detectable Lyme bacteria . Xenodiagnosis use vector detect presence disease-causing microbe.. Researchers use live , laboratory-bred tick see Lyme disease bacteria detect people complete antibiotic therapy common people continue experience symptom fatigue joint pain . &lt; TAB &gt; Objectives : - To see tick use detect B. burgdorferi people Lyme disease receive antibiotic therapy correlate persistent symptom . Eligibility : - Adults least 18 year old : - Untreated erythema migrans ( Lyme disease rash ) ; OR - Untreated Lyme arthritis ; OR - Continuing symptom treatment Lyme disease ; OR - Had Lyme disease antibiotic treatment within past 12 month . - Healthy volunteer Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . - Visit 1 : - Blood urine test , health questionnaire . - Up 30 laboratory-bred , pathogen-free , larval tick ( small poppy seed ) place dress . - Participants may two small biopsy skin . - 4 6 day later , Visit 2 : - Dressing remove tick collect . - Participants answer symptom question . - If many tick still attach , participant come back next day . If enough tick fee successfully , procedure may repeat . - Participants keep diary symptom 30 day . Over 3 month , return clinic 3 time see feel answer questionnaire . Test result discuss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lyme disease common vector borne disease United States . Although antibiotic therapy clinically effective treating symptom Lyme disease patient early course disease , significant number patient receive therapy report persistent symptom . The cause persistent symptom antibiotic therapy Lyme disease area great controversy . Recent study show organism ( Borrelia burgdorferi ) may persist animal antibiotic therapy detect use natural tick vector ( Ixodes scapularis ) acquire organism feeding ( xenodiagnosis ) . Whether occur human unknown . Currently available test human Lyme disease allow determination persistent infection antibiotic therapy . We perform first study use I. scapularis larva xenodiagnosis B. burgdorferi infection human . Our pilot study show xenodiagnosis well tolerate severe adverse event ( AEs ) . The common AE mild itch site . In small pilot study , xenodiagnosis B. burgdorferi positive 2 participant indeterminate 2 participant . Further study need determine sensitivity xenodiagnosis evaluate infection status Lyme disease patient . In proposal , want investigate utility xenodiagnosis identify persistence infection B. burgdorferi treat human Lyme disease . Our objective include assess link detection B. burgdorferi xenodiagnosis persistence symptom patient diagnose Lyme disease , within 1 year , post therapy ; compare rate detection B. burgdorferi xenodiagnosis therapy participant posttreatment Lyme disease symptom ; identify subject characteristic related likelihood detect B. burgdorferi xenodiagnosis include : time infection , time infection therapy , time therapy ; continue assess safety xenodiagnosis human . The result study potential resolve long-standing controversy Lyme disease pathogenesis . While xenodiagnosis unlikely widely use clinical practice due labor intensity speed testing , study show linkage positive xenodiagnostic test persistence symptom B. burgdorferi infection , may prove useful tool test new strategy treatment correlation generally applicable diagnostic marker . Understanding pathogenesis persistent symptom follow Lyme disease , identify reliable diagnostic test determine success antibiotic therapy , critical medical management patient .</detailed_description>

PATIENTS WITH LYME DISEASE , POSTTHERAPY ( N=100 ) 1 . Age 18 old 2 . Lyme disease diagnose previous 13 month , fulfil case definition confirm probable Lyme disease CDC 3 . Completion 1 course antibiotic least 3 month 12 month end therapy xenodiagnostic procedure . 4 . Antibiotic treatment fulfills Infectious Diseases Society America guideline recommend therapy Lyme disease PATIENTS WITH POSTLYME DISEASE COMPLAINTS AT LEAST 12 MONTHS FROM INITIAL TREATMENT ( N=40 ) 1 . Age 18 old 2 . Diagnosed confirm probable Lyme disease fulfil case definition Lyme disease CDC 3 . Received recommended antibiotic therapy Lyme disease 5 least 12 month end initial antibiotic therapy xenodiagnostic procedure . 4 . Persistent recurrent symptom begin worsen within 6 month diagnosis treatment Lyme disease . ACUTE EM ( N=40 ) 1 . Age 18 old . 2 . EM diagnose study physician . 3 . Receiving antibiotic therapy Lyme disease le 48 hour . LYME ARTHRITIS ( N=40 ) 1 . Age 18 old 2 . Lyme arthritis receive antibiotic therapy disease . HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS ( N=20 ) 1 . Age 18 old 2 . No prior history Lyme disease 3 . Negative whole cell ELISA C6based antibody test Lyme disease Patients recently diagnose ( acute ) EM ( within 48 hour start antibiotic therapy ) patient untreated Lyme arthritis recruit attempt increase chance find positive result xenodiagnosis ( attempt positive control ) While patient acute untreated EM would best positive control group , would unethical withhold therapy patient day require tick feeding , due risk dissemination organism possible morbidity . Patients untreated Lyme arthritis recruit establish whether xenodiagnosis use identify infection late stage Lyme patient bacterium know present . These patient infect month harm delay therapy day . Lyme arthritis late manifestation B. burgdorferi infection , hematogenous dissemination already occur late stage . Studies show presence absence previous antibiotic treatment predictive duration untreated arthritis success antibiotic therapy Lyme arthritis . Similarly , patient start therapy EM may still live Borrelia skin xenodiagnosis may able recover bacteria ( culture skin biopsy patient EM become negative quickly within one dose antibiotic therapy ) . While treatment Lyme disease offer protocol , may available via different clinical research protocols regular medical care study site . If , treatment prescribe patient primary care . For patient untreated early Lyme disease ( erythema migrans ) , antibiotic start day tick placement . For patient untreated Lyme arthritis , antibiotic start collection xenodiagnostic tick ( usually 45 day , 7 day ) . For patient Lyme arthritis , less 14 tick feed successfully participant agrees , antibiotic treatment delay repeat procedure . Patients acute EM untreated Lyme arthritis able reenroll Patients Lyme disease , posttherapy . Therefore , case positive result , able compare procedure . Negative control patient include healthy volunteer Lyme endemic area never diagnose Lyme disease negative B. burgdorferi ELISA C6 antibody titer . EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . No antibiotic therapy active Lyme disease previous 3 month ( except patient acute EM ) . 2 . History allergy surgical tape dress . 3 . History severe reaction tick bite ( granuloma systemic reaction ) . 4 . Inability maintain dress reason . 5 . Pregnancy lactation . 6 . Unwillingness use effective method birth control duration participation study ( woman childbearing potential ) least 3 month follow last tick placement . 7 . Use investigational therapy device time study and/or month prior sign inform consent . 8 . Active severe skin disease , uncontrolled diabetes , cancer nonmelanoma skin cancer , autoimmune disease require immunosuppressive therapy , history HIV , chronic viral hepatitis , syphilis . 9 . Oral IV steroid previous 2 week ( topical , nasal , inhaled , intraarticular , replacement dos steroid exclusion ) . 10 . Any condition , opinion investigator , would make patient unsuitable enrollment could interfere patient participate complete study . 11 . Refusal participate specimen collection storage future study relate use . EXCLUSION FROM SKIN BIOPSY PART OF THE PROTOCOL 1 . History form large thick scar ( keloid ) skin injury surgery . 2 .
