	<detailed_description>This pilot study proposal design perform chronological measurement MWF new contrast-enhancing lesion subject treat ACTH acute exacerbation MS . The initial course ACTH ( H.P . Acthar速 ) administer recommended package insert , subcutaneous daily dose 80-120mg unit daily 2-3 week . However , recommend package insert , dosage may individualize accord medical condition subject . Therefore , frequency dose drug may determine consider severity disease initial response subject . The typical dosing MS exacerbation 80mg/day 3-5 day expect initial dose majority thesubjects . MS subject enrol study randomize : Group A : 80mg/day ACTH 3-5 day ( The dose could adjust base individual need subject 80-120mg unit daily 2-3 week . ) Group B : 80mg/day ACTH 3-5 day ( The dose could adjust base individual need subject 80-120mg unit daily 2-3 week . ) , follow monthly 80 mg/day ACTH 3 day 12 month treatment . The Judith Jaffe Multiple Sclerosis Center currently 1000 subject clinical MRI database . The subject sign consent database standard care MRI scan monitor new enhance lesion ; repeat initial scan complete MS center current clinical protocol . All RRMS subject new enhance lesion consider study approach regard participation subject consider candidate consent study , subject randomize ( 1:1 ) receive one course ACTH follow monthly pulse vs. receive one course ACTH treatment . All subject follow-up MRI多s 3 month , 6 month 12 month post lesion onset total 3 additional scan . If patient identify enhance lesion MRI scan obtain database , additional scan obtain study serve baseline MRI . All subject receive first course ACTH within 4 week new lesion detection . Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) dynamic disease biologically clinically , characterize temporally complex pattern inflammation , demyelination/remyelination , axonal loss . The cycle demyelination remyelination show occur MS lesion ( 1,2 ) . High dose corticosteroid mainstay treatment MS relapse . Corticosteroid treatment shortens time recovery relapse , presumably least part due anti-inflammatory effect . Despite anti-inflammatory property , corticosteroid show impair delay remyelination animal model MS ( 3,4 ) little clinical evidence longer-term beneficial effect . Adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) gel , long-acting formulation full sequence ACTH include pro-opiomelanocortin ( POMC ) peptide , consider alternative corticosteroid treatment relapse ( currently FDA approve indication ) . ACTH gel exerts direct anti-inflammatory immune-modulating effect within central nervous system ( CNS ) . These effect mediate via induction endogenous corticosteroid production also via effect melanocortin receptor ( 5 ) . Studies show ACTH melanocortins may reduce neuroinflammatory response ( 6 ) , ACTH show protect mature oligodendrocytes inflammation-related damage excitotoxicity ( 7 ) . Currently however , paucity study use advanced MRI metric determine ACTH may reparative neuroprotective property subject MS. We propose study monthly course ACTH subject new lesion compare one-time treatment course ACTH new activity . We hypothesize continued exposure anti-inflammatory effect ACTH new lesion would superior promote remyelination compare one-time treatment course . Given majority endogenous remyelination felt begin within month lesion development likely prominent month follow , one year study likely sufficient measure process . T2 relaxometry MR imaging technique series T2-weighted image different echo time obtain contribution water associate myelin tissue compartment differentiate use T2 decay curve analysis ( 8 ) . The relative contribution myelin water , represent myelin water fraction ( MWF ) , show highly correlate histological myelin measurement animal model ( 9 ) ex-vivo brain ( 10,11 ) , apply MS subject ( 12 ) . The histological correlation T2 relaxometry myelin content make excellent candidate biomarker myelin content find reproducible sensitive marker change time ( 13-16 ) . Through application multi-slice 2D T2prep spiral gradient echo ( GRE ) imaging , T2 data efficiently acquire ( 17,18 ) optimize 3D T2prep GRE sequence 3T full brain coverage achieve within 10 minute ( 19 ) . One main advantage use T2 relaxometry MWF surrogate myelin advance MR modality lie T2 spectrum ( T2 decay curve analysis ) . Both MWF extracellular T2 component ( intermediate peak ) within T2 spectrum ) increase edema ( 20 ) , thus extracellular pool stabilizes , ensure change MWF true reflection myelination . The primary objective study determine monthly pulse dose three-day course ACTH ( H.P . Acthar速 ) effective recover myelin 12 month , measure MWF , new multiple sclerosis lesion compare one course treatment . The main secondary objective utilize every three-month MWF measurement determine peak time remyelination new multiple sclerosis lesion follow course 12 month .</detailed_description>
