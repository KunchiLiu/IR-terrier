	<detailed_description>Primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) chronic liver disease cause inflammation obstruction bile duct . It eventually lead liver cirrhosis due fibrosis , liver failure liver cancer . The diagnosis PSC challenge single diagnostic test usually involve multidisciplinary approach MRI play major role . Assessment disease status important triage patient optimal treatment include liver transplantation prevention liver failure . There however establish blood test reliably track disease progression repeat liver biopsy multiple drawback include complication , cost feasibility . There dire need accurate non-invasive tool longitudinal assessment PSC . MR Elastography ( MRE ) recently prove estimate liver fibrosis noninvasively accurately . Estimation liver fibrosis MRE along image derived morphological information ( MRCP ) utilize study comprehensively provide surrogate non-invasive imaging biomarker monitor disease status PSC . The patient would agree undergo liver FibroScan examination grade fibrosis within 3 month MRI examination . In addition standard protocol liver biliary MR examination include MRCP contrast enhance imaging , MRE add study exam follow informed consent . A control group non-PSC subject know chronic liver disease chronic viral hepatitis liver biopsy FibroScan within similar time frame 3 month , assess fibrosis grade also undergo MR Elastography order validate result fibrosis MRE . The study significant implication care patient PSC . Successful outcomes provide opportunity optimal treatment triage include liver transplantation via accurate non-invasive estimation true disease status PSC .</detailed_description>
