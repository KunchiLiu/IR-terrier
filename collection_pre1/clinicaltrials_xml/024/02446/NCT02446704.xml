	<brief_title>Study Olaparib Temozolomide Patients With Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer Following Failure Prior Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I/II clinical trial , two part . The participant ask participate one part study . The first part test safety combination drug try define appropriate dose use future study . The second part test whether combination drug effective treat small cell lung cancer . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug study . It also mean U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve combination drug Small Cell Lung Cancer . Olaparib ( Lynparza ) FDA approve treatment type ovarian cancer associate particular DNA change . Olaparib work block activity protein call poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) involve DNA repair . Cancer cell rely PARP repair DNA enable continue divide . Olaparib use research study cancer . Information research study suggest drug may help treat patient small cell lung cancer . While approved FDA small cell lung cancer , consider part standard treatment cancer . Temozolomide ( Temodar ) approve FDA treatment type brain tumor , glioblastoma . It study small cell lung cancer previous research study . While approved FDA small cell lung cancer , consider part standard treatment relapse disease . In research study , investigator look maximum tolerate dose MTD combination olaparib temozolomide give safely . The investigator also begin collect information effect combination small cell lung cancer</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study . The eligibility criterion apply phase I phase II portion study . Participant must histologically cytologically confirm small cell lung cancer may candidate potentially curative therapy . Presence measurable disease ( RECIST 1.1 ) : At least one lesion , previously irradiate , accurately measure baseline ≥ 10 mm long diameter ( except lymph node must short axis ≥ 15 mm ) compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) suitable accurate repeat measurement . The small cell lung cancer must progress radiographically follow platinumbased ( cisplatin and/or carboplatin ) standard prior chemotherapy regimen . Any number interval prior line therapy allow . Patients receive prior platinumbased chemotherapy radiation limit stage SCLC subsequently develop relapsed disease eligible , long platinumbased therapy give within 12 month prior time relapse . Participant ( male/female ) must ≥18 year age . Participant must normal organ bone marrow function measure within 28 day prior administration study treatment define : Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥100 x 10^9/L Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( unless liver metastasis present case must ≤5 x ULN ) Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ECOG performance status 01 Participant must life expectancy ≥ 16 week . Women childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 28 day initial dose olaparib temozolomide AND must agree use two highly effective form contraception ( see Section 5.5 ) throughout participation study least 3 month last dose olaparib temozolomide , OR confirm prior treatment day 1 postmenopausal surgically sterile . Postmenopausal define : Amenorrheic 1 year follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment , LH FSH level post menopausal range woman 50 , radiationinduced oophorectomy last menses &gt; 1 year ago , chemotherapyinduced menopause &gt; 1 year interval since last menses , surgical sterilisation ( bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy ) . Participant willing comply protocol duration study , undergo treatment schedule visit examination include follow . Participant must obtain prior approval insurance reimburse oral temozolomide duration study agree selfpay oral temozolomide . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . The exclusion criterion apply phase I phase II portion study . Involvement plan and/or conduct study ( applies AstraZeneca staff and/or staff study site ) . Previous enrollment present study . Participation another clinical study investigational product 21 day prior first dose olaparib temozolomide . Participants receive systemic chemotherapy , radiotherapy ( except palliative reason ) , within 2 week last dose prior study treatment ( long period depend defined characteristic agent use ) . The patient receive stable dose bisphosphonates bone metastasis , study long start least 4 week prior treatment olaparib temozolomide . Participants discontinue use follow class inhibitor CYP3A4 . Patients drug eligible washout period minimum 7 day occurs start olaparib temozolomide . Azole antifungal Macrolide antibiotic Protease inhibitor Persistent clinically significant toxicity ( &gt; =CTCAE v. 4.0 grade 2 ) cause previous cancer therapy , exception alopecia . Participants previously document diagnosis myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) ( dysplastic leukocyte morphology suggestive MDS ) acute myeloid leukaemia . Participants symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis . Baseline brain image CT MRI require patient . Participants brain metastasis treat prior radiation therapy stable subsequent scan allow . Participants untreated possible brain metastasis new time screen &lt; 1 cm asymptomatic allow . The participant receive corticosteroid long start stable dose least 28 day prior treatment . Major surgery within 14 day start study treatment patient must recover effect major surgery . Participants consider poor medical risk due serious , uncontrolled medical disorder , nonmalignant systemic disease active , uncontrolled infection . Examples include , limited , QTc prolongation &gt; 470 msec , uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , recent ( within 3 month ) myocardial infarction , unstable spinal cord compression ( untreated unstable least 28 day prior study entry ) , extensive bilateral lung disease le 20 % predict lung function DLCO ( Lung Diffusion Capacity Testing ) , psychiatric disorder prohibits obtain informed consent . Participants unable swallow orally administer medication patient gastrointestinal disorder likely interfere absorption study medication . Pregnant Breast feeding woman . All patient ( male female ) must agree practice medically acceptable method contraception define section 5.5 . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients history know serologically positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) receive antiviral therapy . Baseline testing require . Patients know active Hepatitis B C. Baseline testing require . Patients know hypersensitivity olaparib excipients product . Patients uncontrolled seizure . Patients second primary cancer , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumor curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 5 year . Patients current symptomatic pneumonitis , extensive bilateral lung disease high resolution CT scan . Patients whole blood transfusion last 120 day prior entry study . Patients previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant . Patients active , uncontrolled infection . Patients need continue treatment prohibit medication list Section 5.6 Patients complete appropriate washout period prohibit medication Section 5.6</criteria>
