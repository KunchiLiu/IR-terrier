	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Anifrolumab Compared Placebo Adult Subjects With Active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , multicentre , multinational , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate efficacy safety intravenous treatment regimen anifrolumab versus placebo subject moderately severely active , autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) receive standard care ( SOC ) treatment . The study perform adult subject age 18 70 year age . Approximately 360 subject receive SOC treatment randomise 1:1 ratio receive fix intravenous dose anifrolumab placebo every 4 week total 13 dos ( Week 0 Week 48 ) , primary endpoint evaluate Week 52 visit . Investigational product administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion via infusion pump minimum 30 minute , every 4 week .</detailed_description>
