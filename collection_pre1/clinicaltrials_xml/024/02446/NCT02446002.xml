	<brief_title>Assessment Effect Naltrexone Lofexidine Single Dose Pharmacokinetics Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects confine inpatient facility total 14 night 15 day . Subjects successfully complete screen report inpatient facility ( Day -1 ) . At Day 1 subject receive first single , oral dose 0.4 mg lofexidine HCl ( two 0.2 mg tablet ) dose 240 mL water ( food ) . The lofexidine dose follow 74-hour interval begin naltrexone daily dose Day 4 .The first naltrexone administration Day 4 dose approximately 25 mg QD , subsequent dos Days 5 13 50 mg QD . On Day 11 , second single dose lofexidine ( 0.4 mg ) administer follow daily administration naltrexone dose ( 50 mg ) . The daily administration naltrexone dose ( 50 mg ) continue Day 12 Day 13.After administration lofexidine Day 1 Day 11 , fingerstick blood sample collect lofexidine PK analysis dose dose multiple time points.Safety assess record adverse event ( AEs ) , measure vital sign ( blood pressure pulse rate ) clinical laboratory test ( chemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) , record 12-lead safety Holter electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , perform physical exam .</detailed_description>
