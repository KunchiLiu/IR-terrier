	<brief_title>Late Metabolic Effects Metformin Therapy Gestational Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gestational diabetes usually manage diet insulin , need . However , oral metformin therapy also use treat gestational diabetes short-term study show effective also safe child . However , long-term study effect lack . Previously , several year ago , 217 pregnant woman gestational diabetes Turku 100 woman Oulu , Finland , randomise either insulin metformin therapy treat gestational diabetes .

The aim study whether metformin give pregnancy metabolic effect child 9 year age . To family contact mail ask participate study . At 9 year age , follow investigation make ( consent child family ) : oral glucose tolerance test+insulin+c-peptide , plasma lipoprotein , adiponectin , PAI-1 ( plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ) , IL-6 ( interleukin-6 ) , HS CRP ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ) , p-metabolomics , DEXA , abdominal MRI , WISC IV ( Wechsler intelligence scale child IV ) cognitive test , BRIEF questionnaire , questionnaire diet health habit . The study subject also clinically examine measure blood pressure take . All analysis perform University hospital laboratory radiology facility use modern technique . The amount blood take limit also radiation dose DEXA small . The data keep behind lock key . Statistical analysis perform study whether child expose metformin pregnancy difference metabolism well-being exposed insulin . This study involve new medical treatment study subject .</detailed_description>
