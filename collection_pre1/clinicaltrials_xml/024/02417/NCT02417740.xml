	<brief_summary>Background : - Noncirrhotic Portal Hypertension ( NCPH ) cause liver disease increase pressure blood vessel liver . It seem start slowly many warning sign . Many people may even know liver disease . There specific treatment NCPH . Objectives : - To learn NCPH develops time . Eligibility : - People age 12 old NCPH risk get . In past year , type liver disease typically result cirrhosis , liver cancer , active substance abuse . Design : - Participants 2 screen visit . - Visit 1 : see may develop NCPH . - Medical history - Physical exam - Urine stool study - Abdominal ultrasound - Fibroscan . Sound wave measure liver stiffness . &lt; TAB &gt; - Visit 2 : - Blood test - Abdominal MRI - Echocardiogram - Questionnaire - Liver blood vessel pressure ( hepatic venous portal gradient ( HVPG ) ) measurement . This do small tube insert neck vein . - They may liver biopsy . - All participant visit clinic every 6 month history , physical exam , blood test . They also repeat screen test yearly . - Participants NCPH also : - Upper endoscopy test . A tube insert mouth go esophagus stomach . - At least every 2 year : Esophagogastroduodenoscopy . - At least every 4 year : test include HVPG measurement liver biopsy . - Participants without NCPH also : - Liver biopsy HVPG measurement see NCPH . - Every 2 year : abdominal MRI stool study . - The study last indefinitely .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Noncirrhotic Portal Hypertension ( NCPH ) include spectrum chronic liver disease characterize increased pressure within portal circulation absence cirrhosis . The complication NCPH similar cirrhosis induce portal hypertension include development gastrointestinal varix , portal hypertensive gastropathy , splenomegaly , sepsis ascites . However , unlike cirrhosis relate portal hypertension , NCPH characterize well-preserved hepatic synthetic function . With increase recognition patient noncirrhotic portal hypertensive liver disease , mortality due NCPH , clear specific mechanism ( ) natural history ( ) noncirrhotic portal hypertensive liver disease yet elucidate described . At Clinical Center NIH , various cohort patient identify increase risk development noncirrhotic portal hypertensive liver diseases Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) , common variable immunodeficiency ( CVID ) , Turner Syndrome ( TS ) congenital hepatic fibrosis ( CHF ) name . We propose study individual NCPH , risk develop NCPH within cohort patient know risk NCPH indefinite period time . Through continued evaluation scientific discovery , aim provide great understanding noncirrhotic portal hypertensive liver diseases different underlie biological process lead development NCPH . We also aim scant exist knowledge regard natural history disease global phenomenon portal hypertension . From data obtain natural history protocol , future study plan evaluate specific hypothesis specific disease cohort . Patients 12 year age old disease know cause cirrhosis exclude . Individuals think risk development NCPH undergo preliminary testing include ; History physical examination , blood , urine stool test , radiologic imaging , echocardiogram fibroscan . Those evidence suggestive NCPH undergo transjugular percutaneous liver biopsy transjugular hepatic venous gradient measurement endoscopy . After evaluation , without strong evidence NCPH ask return biannual clinic visit update history physical assessment . Those evidence NCPH follow every six month additional testing may include image laboratory evaluation . Over time , individual develop NCPH convert intensive characterization monitoring schema describe protocol . All patient NCPH undergo preventative screening examination complication NCPH . There planned treatment patient exist newly diagnose NCPH , treatment currently exist . Treatment complication NCPH accord standard care referral appropriate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 12 year , male female Known diagnosis NCPH , risk NCPH virtue underlie disease process limited ; CGD , SCD , Mastocytosis , CVID , CF , CHF see NIH clinical center via referral outside institution . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Evidence form liver disease typically result cirrhosis . Evidence active chronic Hepatitis B infection define presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) serum elevate HBV DNA ( &gt; 10,000 IU/mL ) . Hepatitis C define presence hepatitis C RNA serum . Primary sclerosing cholangitis define liver histology . Primary biliary cirrhosis define cholestasis , +/ antimitochondrial antibody positivity liver histology . Wilson disease define ceruloplasmin limit normal liver histology urinary copper consistent Wilson disease . Autoimmune hepatitis define antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) 3 EU great liver histology consistent autoimmune hepatitis previous response immunosuppressive therapy autoimmune hepatitis . Hemochromatosis define presence 3+ 4+ stainable iron liver biopsy homozygosity C282Y . Patients iron saturation index &gt; 45 % serum ferritin level &gt; 300 ng/ml men &gt; 250 ng/ml woman undergo genetic test hemochromatosis . Bile duct obstruction suggest image study do within previous six month . The presence cirrhosis demonstrate liver biopsy . Active substance abuse , alcohol , inhale injection drug within previous one year ( assessed patient interview patient selfreport ) . Evidence hepatocellular carcinoma ; either alphafetoprotein ( AFP ) level great 50 ng/ml ( normal &lt; 6.6ng/ml ) and/or ultrasound ( image study ) demonstrate mass suggestive liver cancer . Evidence Cholangiocarcinoma suggest liver histology . Any severe condition , opinion investigator would impede patient participation compliance study . Inability comply give write informed consent .</criteria>
