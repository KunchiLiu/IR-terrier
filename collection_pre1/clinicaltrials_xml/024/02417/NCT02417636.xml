	<detailed_description>SECTION 1 : PROTOCOL SUMMARY Title : Impact Task Shifting Type II ART Delivery Patient Process Outcomes Uganda Rationale : Health care worker shortage remain major impediment scale-up antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) sub-Saharan Africa [ 1 ] . Sub-Saharan Africa suffer world 's pronounced crisis human resource health 36 57 country currently face significant health worker shortages [ 2 ] . The health workforce crisis exacerbate HIV epidemic thwart effort expand provide universal access HIV/AIDS prevention , care treatment . The shortage health worker sub-Saharan Africa present great challenge service delivery , particularly scale antiretroviral therapy . According World Health Organization global deficit train health care worker need provide essential health service order achieve Millennium Development Goals , include scale biomedical intervention HIV/AIDS great 4 million [ 2 ] . In attempt meet demand ART service , World Health Organization coordinate global effort strengthen expand current health workforce recommend task shift one potential strategy meet enormous demand health care worker provide HIV/AIDS care treatment . This particularly important time patient stay ART long period . Task shift allow physician see severely ill patient thus free time duty . In addition , patient initiate ART available health worker attend . There however need empirical evidence support implementation task shift . For example , one critical question whether candidate health worker cadres task shift ART initiation monitoring , perform well doctors/clinicians . Country-specific evidence regard question necessary develop task-shifting policy initiating policy reform Uganda . Under PEPFAR fund Public Health Evaluation ( PHE ) conduct select health facility determine impact implementing WHO Global Recommendations Guidelines Task Shifting HIV treatment doctor clinical officer nurse . Although task shift HIV treatment occur de facto several country [ 3-10 ] , rarely institutionalize allow national policy . Reliable data necessary good understand whether include strategy national policy operational guideline . The Investigators propose conduct randomize field intervention study address question whether nurse-initiated monitored ART associate inferior outcome compare clinician-initiated maintained ART treatment-naive , HIV positive individual . The finding study contribute knowledge best increase access quality life-saving HIV treatment well improve health care worker skill strengthen health system efficiency . Primary Objectives : To compare follow outcome among HIV-infected individual antiretroviral therapy initiate monitored nurse initiate monitored clinician 6- , 12- , 18- 24- month post ART initiation : - virologic failure ( â‰¥ 1000 viral copies/ml ) - toxicity failure - patient retention - all-cause mortality Secondary Objectives : 1 . Compare immunological response time point 6- , 12- , 18- 24- month post ART initiation 2 . Compare accuracy stag HIV-infected patient accord WHO treatment guideline process outcomes among provider group Tertiary Objectives : Test HIV-1 drug resistance mutation ( primary secondary ) among person newly initiate ART .</detailed_description>
