	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well target rapamycin complex 1/2 ( TORC1/2 ) inhibitor MLN0128 work treat patient lung cancer stage IV come back ( recurrent ) mutation nuclear factor , erythroid 2-like 2 ( NFE2L2 ) kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 ( KEAP1 ) gene . Damage gene may cause cancer grow . TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 may stop happen block enzyme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TORC1/2 Inhibitor MLN0128 Treating Patients With Stage IV Recurrent Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECITVES : I . Evaluate overall response rate TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor MLN0128 NFE2L2 KEAP1 mutant stage IV squamous cell lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate median progression free survival patient cohort . II . To explore feasibility perform reverse phase protein array analysis ( RPPA ) pair snap-frozen core biopsy patient study prior MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) dose week 2 treatment . III . To describe effectiveness MLN0128 ( TAK-228 ) suppress activation mTOR PI3K signal exploratory RPPA analysis . OUTLINE : Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
