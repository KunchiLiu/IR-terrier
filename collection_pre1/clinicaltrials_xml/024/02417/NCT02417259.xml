	<brief_summary>We conduct prospective cohort study 20 child cyanotic congenital heart disease admit cardiac surgery . We record cerebral somatic near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) two site - forehead flank region use Covidien INVOSâ„¢ 5100C Cerebral / Somatic Oximeter . The monitoring begin one hour pre-operatively ( baseline ) continue 48hours post-operatively . We also take measurement prior discharge hospital . Baseline demographic , physiological laboratory variable record . Clinical outcome variable include mortality , duration intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay , duration mechanical ventilation , inotropic support fee tolerance also record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NIRS use predict short term clinical outcome ( low cardiac output state , prolonged ventilation , prolonged hospital stay ) long term clinical outcome ( reduced neurodevelopmental score 1year , radiological change magnetic resonance imaging ) . NIRS also test traditional marker global tissue perfusion like mixed venous saturation serum lactate , however , result study mixed . There insufficient prospective data evaluate NIRs direct clinical outcome uncertainty threshold value duration threshold value lead tissue injury . Because lack data , benefit risk management strategy target improve NIRS value remain unknown . We characterize time series cerebral somatic oximetry , pulse oximetry partial pressure arterial oxygen cyanotic child undergo surgical repair congenital heart defect . We determine correlation time series . This new information advance understand hemodynamic change occur perioperative period may lead new therapeutic target . The primary hypothesis delay increase cerebral somatic oximetry post-operation compare pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) partial pressure arterial oxygen ( PaO2 ) occur immediately . The secondary hypothesis establish applicability desaturation score ( decrease 20 % area curve [ AUC ] hour ) early prediction adverse outcome . The oximetry probe place pre-induction anesthesia ( determine baseline ) record continuous throughout operation 48hours post-operatively . Children undergoing cardiac surgery generally stay hospital 1-2weeks . We also take oximetry measurement prior discharge hospital ( determine new steady state ) . Sites measure cerebral ( forehead ) somatic ( left flank ) .</detailed_description>
