	<brief_summary>In kidney disease , tubule-interstitium become much relevant , formerly glomerulus consider main importance . Kidney 's tubular atrophy interstitital fibrosis recognize long term prognostic value . We aim evaluate function kidney 's tubule-interstitium furosemide excretion intravenous administration drug , correlate rate excretion furosemide interstitial fibrosis finding schedule kidney biopsy patient chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Furosemide Stress Test Predictor Tubular Function Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient schedule kidney biopsy invite participate standard isovolemic furosemide stress test biopsy procedure . The latter consist 1.5 miligrams per kilogram weight intravenous furosemide administration , urinary output follow measurement . The urinary output replace intravenously normal saline avoid dehydration and/or hypotension . A standard 5ml sample blood take test aliquot urine furosemide administration frozen . After completion formely mention test , patient proceed schedule kidney biopsy along intervention consider appropiate attend physician . Kidney biopsy sample examine histopathology service degree interstitial fibrosis describe . The degree fibrosis correlate degree furosemide excretion urinary output .</detailed_description>
