	<brief_summary>Pain associate sickle cell disease common emergency department visit . It also frequently associate high emergency department recidivism rate pain control admission hospital . Opiates consider first line therapy acute flare manage chronic pain . This often time lead stigma `` opiate seeker '' `` frequent flier '' . With study , wish explore whether add ketamine standard acute opiate therapy ( morphine dilaudid ) decrease subsequent repeat dos opiates improve patient 's perception pain . In addition , explore whether ketamine adjuvant therapy help reduce hospital admission management acute sickle cell crisis pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketamine Infusion Acute Sickle Cell Crisis Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total number require patient would 53 per arm ( 106 patient ) . The targeted study population patient 18 year old old present acute sickle cell crisis pain either described diffuse throughout body localized extremity/back . The expected duration study 2 year Prior initiation study , research associate would responsible randomization process . The goal study enroll 106 patient total ( 53 per arm ) . Patients assign study arm via online random-number generator ( http : //www.randomization.com ) . Each number correlate seal opaque envelope , pull sequential order patient enrol . Within envelope contain particular study medication . A primary master list keep lock secured cabinet pharmacy . Only pharmacy personnel primary/secondary investigator access list . Pharmacy use master list prepare study medication . A second master list would also secure EM research room back-up purpose . The secondary master list would assess primary master list lose . Only primary secondary investigator access secondary master list . Detailed study procedure : Step 1 : Identification patient chief complaint visit reason sickle cell via Emergency Department 's Statusboard Research Associate study investigator . Step 2 : Screening potentially eligible patient inclusion/exclusion criterion checklist per Data Collection instrument ( See attach Form 1 ) Research Associate study investigator . Step 3 : If patient eligible , Research Associate study investigator would obtain informed consent explain potential risk benefit receive study intervention . Step 4 : There placebo arm . All provider , except pharmacy , blind whether patient receive ketamine saline . All patient receive conventional standard therapy ( dilaudid morphine ) order emergency department resident attend . Each patient receive IVP bolus infusion separate IVP . Arm A include 0.3 mg/kg IVP bolus Ketamine follow 0.1 mg/kg/hr infusion 3 hour along initial dose standard therapy . Arm B receive IVP bolus normal saline ( utilize 0.3 mg/kg calculation ) follow normal saline infusion separate standard therapy dose . Step 5 : An order would place medical resident , medical attending , study investigator physician , pharmacist permission attend physician Allscripts study intervention . Step 6 : Upon receive order Allscripts , order would verify pharmacy . Once notify envelope pull pharmacy prepare ketamine IVP bolus infusion NS IVP bolus infusion . Conventional therapy pull general ED accudose stock ED RN . ED personnel obtain infusion preparation pharmacy . It label patient , study number , without identify mark . When study medication pick , pharmacy open seal envelope confirm medication arm prepare order internally verify correct preparation . Step 7 : The nurse assign patient would administer intervention . Step 8 : A research associate study investigator would approach patient ass record primary outcome , secondary outcome design time interval . The data record data collection instrument . If additional medication request patient , order would place medical resident attend assign patient ED . Step 9 : All data retrieve paper data collection sheet transcribe encrypted password protect electronic database research associate . • All patient identifier would de-identified database . All participant would assign study participant number.This database would store Emergency Department faculty research room . Only research associate study investigator would access electronic database . The paper data collection sheet would store stationary lock cabinet Emergency Department safe keep . At end study , record maintain accord hospital 's record-retention policy . Step 10 : At end study enrollment , data analyze . Blinding remove final data analysis compilation . Step 11 : At conclusion study , final result conclusion would present IRB . All data record paper would shred destroyed . All data record electronic database would delete .</detailed_description>
