	<brief_summary>Background : Cervical degenerative disc disease frequent consequence age . Degeneration may lead disc herniation . Surgery indicate presence root compression cervicobrachial neuralgia and/or myelopathy . Purpose : The main objective study comparison efficacy total disc replacement ( TDR ) Anterior Cervical Decompression Fusion ( ACDF ) surgical treatment symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease term `` Success '' rate , define preservation adjacent segment , 24 month surgery . In knowledge , publish data randomize clinical trial compare radiological parameter ( worsen degeneration sign static cervical spine radiograph worsen disc degeneration sign MRI ) level adjacent surgery , 2 surgical approach patient suffer cervical degenerative disc disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Disc Replacement Versus Anterior Cervical Decompression Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical treatment cervical degenerative disc disease usually consist neural decompression follow intervertebral space reconstruction . ACDF consist interbody fusion replace disc space cage pack bone substitute , insert anterior portion interspace . Fusion successful approximately 95 % patient good excellent clinical result . Unfortunately , 25 % patient develop degenerative change adjacent level surgery . TDR consist total disc replacement preserve segmental motion decrease load adjacent level . Worsening radiological degeneration sign adjacent level seem important long term prognostic factor reoperation . In trial , include patient randomly assign undergo either TDR ACDF Six visit plan study : pre inclusion visit within 3 month surgery , inclusion/randomisation day surgery , 3 follow visit ( 45 day , 6 , 12 month surgery ) end study visit 24 month surgery ( time withdrawal relevant ) .</detailed_description>
