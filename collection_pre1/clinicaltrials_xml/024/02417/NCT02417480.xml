	<brief_summary>This study pilot test use two mHealth device . One call Bite Counter one call MisFit . The study among sample participant ( n = 50 ) monitor eat sleep habit . The Bite Counter wearable watch-like device detects record individual take bite food . The benefit use Bite Counter place low-burden participant self-monitor dietary intake . The MisFit commercial device track individual 's sleeping activity . The purpose study ( 1 ) find Bite Counter calculates daily bite take vegan diet compare omnivorous diet , ( 2 ) examine difference sleep activity individual follow vegan diet compare omnivorous diet ( 3 ) get feedback user device test large study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differences Eating Frequency Between Vegan Omnivorous Diets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In several randomized control trial compare vegan vegetarian diet omnivorous dietary approach , significant weight loss occur absence significantly different change report energy intake group . This different see study use traditional weight loss diet ( reduce energy omnivorous diet ) , demonstrate great reduction energy intake correspond great weight loss . In observational cohort study , among Adventist Health Study-2 participant follow five different diet , BMI find low among vegan high among omnivore ; yet energy intake significantly differ among five group , average 2,000 kcals/day , exception lower energy intake among semi-vegetarians . This difference body weight without observed difference energy intake could possibly explain high level physical activity among vegan vegetarian participant , observe cohort study . Physical activity , however , control randomize trial either give participant identical exercise recommendation , hold exercise level constant across experimental group . This present study utilize Bite Counter estimate difference calorie consume vegan diet omnivore diet . The significance use Bite Counter simple way estimate energy intake . While many device measure energy expenditure ( e.g . various exercise scale equipment ) , device account energy intake . Traditional method estimate energy intake tend utilize dietary recall , procedure require much effort provide real time feedback like Bite Counter . Therefore , study contribute current research capture data dietary difference vegan omnivore , well assess usability device dietary self-monitoring . The study also use objective physical activity sleep tracker ( MisFit ) examine difference exercise sleep omnivorous vegan participant .</detailed_description>
