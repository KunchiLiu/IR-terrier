	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) characterize frequent relapse , often result common bacterial infection . Enhancing immune response patient may decrease frequency relapse . The use mechanic Polyvalent Bacterial Lysate ( PMBL , Ismigen , 13 bacterial strain ) may enhance immune response therefore help significantly control relapse patient . In current study effect administration PBML patient older 40 year , moderate , severe severe COPD , good discrete physical condition number relapse observation period 12 month . In addition , effect PMBL duration interval relapse , relapse symptom , use drug , number day absence work , number hospitalization duration thereof potential toxicity treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ancillary Study center Genoa : To investigate subgroup patient , take part AIACE study , ability PMBL induce Ig response , modify NK blood pattern , modulate inflammatory parameter ( e.g . CRP ) . Material &amp; Methods : 30 patient enrol Respiratory Department Genoa University AIACE trial double blind randomly treat bacterial lysate placebo , participate ancillary study . A informed consent participate laboratory trial request patient besides already ethical procedure approve AIACE study . In order ass enhancement concentration salivary antibody , sample salivary fluid ( SF ) collect day 0 use Salivette ( Starsted , Germany , use accord manufacture 's instruction ) store frozen assayed . Then , treatment PMBL carry ten day . After twenty-day rest ( day 30 ) , end first treatment course ( day 90 ) begin end second drug course ( day 180 , 210 ) end study ( day 360 ) , SF sample collect stored frozen . Besides AIACE laboratory procedure already approve , blood sample ( 6 glass tube ) collect peripheral NK blood phenotyping CRP dosage . Purified NK cell obtain peripheral blood sample time 0 , 90 360 negative selection use NK cell isolation Kit ( Miltenyi Biotech , Bergisch Gladbach - Germany ) follow manufacturer instruction . The NK cell population assess purity homogeneously display CD3-CD14-CD15-CD19- phenotype select . Cells obtain describe analyze ( time t0 ) flow cytometry use follow mAbs : anti-CD3 , anti-CD56 , anti-NKp30 , anti-NKp46 , anti-NKp44 , anti-NKG2D , anti-CD158B1/B2j , anti-KIR p70 , anti-CD159A , anti-CD226 ( Immunotech -Marseille , France ) . In order ass efficacy PMBL systemic inflammation CRP evaluate day 0 90 360 . Finally , special T cell subpopulation , regulatory T cell , assay collect sample , together concentration circulate chemokines , cytokine inflammation-related molecule use specific immunobeads flow cytometry .</detailed_description>
