	<brief_summary>The study involve novel Virtual Reality Interface offer full-body immersion `` Alterniity AR '' specifically computer exercise blend game activity . It hypothesize `` Alterniity AR '' facilitate , game blend cognitive and/or physical exercise improve global cognition compare control group ; moreover , improvement may manifest brain activity change . The investigator explore impact potential moderator combine exercise-induced cognitive benefit , well , individual/separate training scheme . In addition , propose study provide Alterniity AR '' close feedback loop direct , reliable , non-invasive method assess change brain activity associate elderly risk dementia . The paradigm current study combine neurophysiological knowledge mathematical signal processing pattern recognition method temporally spatially map brain function , connectivity synchronization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently , direct , reliable , bed-side , non-invasive method assess change brain activity associate elderly risk dementia . Event Related Potentials ( ERPs ) , temporal reflection neural mass electrical activity cell specific region brain occur response stimulus , may offer method , provide noninvasive portable measure brain function . The ERPs provide excellent temporal information , spatial resolution ERPs traditionally limit . However , use high-density electroencephalograph ( EEG ) record spatial resolution ERPs improve significantly . The propose study provide additional evidence utility contribution Personalized Brain Network Activation ( PBNA ) test ( reflect temporal spatial change brain activity well brain functional connectivity associate minor neurocognitive disorder ) early dementia management . The study conduct 4 site : Switzerland , Germany , USA Greece . It use pre-post-test design between-participant factor group [ intervention ( ) vs. passive and/or active control ] . Post-test conduct within 2 week completion exercise period . Interventions carry within day care centre , hospital , senior care centre , memory outpatient centre , local parish , participant ' home . Centres provide 8-12 exercise week per year 3 year , frequency least 3 `` Alterniity AR '' session per week , result least 24-36 intervention session year study . The closed feedback loop direct PBNA test basically divide 3 phase - first EEG data collect subject use portable EEG system participant perform `` Alterniity AR '' intervention . The EEG data analyse offline . Finally , `` Alterniity AR '' exercise type , configuration difficulty level update base analyse data .
