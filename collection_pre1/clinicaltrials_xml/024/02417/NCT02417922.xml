	<brief_summary>The purpose see Autologous Conditioned Plasma ( ACP ) promote accelerate tendon tissue heal Conservative treat total Achilles Tendon Tears . 40 healthy male randomize either receive ACP Placebo ( saline ) around rupture achilles tendon baseline , 2 week , 4 week 6 week 8 week immobilization period orthosis . Ultrasound symptoms score ( ATLS ) perform baseline , 8 week immobilization 3 month , 6 month 12 month . Scoring functional test perform 8 week immobilization 12 week , 24 week 52 week injury date .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Autologous Conditioned Plasma Treatment Conservative Treated Total Achilles Tendon Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total achilles rupture severe injury many long lasting functional deficit afterwards . Treatment option either operative conservative treatment . Conservative treatment total Achilles rupture become popular last 10 year . Nevertheless still see high risk re-rupture compare surgery . Aim : The aim study patient acute total Achilles tendon rupture examine Autologous Conditioned Plasma ( ACP ) promote accelerate tendon tissue heal Conservative treat total Achilles tendon rupture thereby give well functional outcome . Materials method : Healthy male ( 25-60 year ; n=40 ) acute total achilles tendon rupture randomly assign either 1 ) ACP ( ~ 4 ml ) 2 ) placebo ( saline ~ 4 ml ) treatment . Participants treat 4 successive occasion 2 week ( wks ) interval 8 week conservative treatment orthoses . The injection perform ultrasound guidance . All subject undergo 8 week immobilization period orthoses full weigh bearing guide proper rehabilitation regime intervention . Clinical effect assess change functional scoring system ( ATLS ) , isometric muscle strength muscle function ( one-legged heel-rise test ) . Furthermore tendon length measure ultrasound . All outcome measure record baseline 8 week immobilization ( expect muscle strength function ) , 12 week , 24 week 52 week injury . Results : Look possible change difference group ( ACP Placebo ) ATLS score , muscle strength , ultrasound tendon length elongation muscle function . Statistics : All data analyze SigmaPlot v11 use two-way repeated measure ANOVA Student-Newman-Keuls Post-hoc test . This use see change time group ( time effect ) differences group within time-points ( group effect ) . All data present mean Â± SEM time .</detailed_description>
