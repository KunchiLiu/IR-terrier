	<brief_title>Ketogenic Diet - Randomized , Controlled , Cross-over Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : The aim randomize controlled exploratory study study effect ketogenic diet ( low carb - high fat ( LCHF ) diet ) compare National Food Administration ( NFA ) recommend diet ( NNR2012 ) . Primary outcome blood lipid diet specific biomarkers . Power calculation show 20 participant need obtain significant result 90 % power 95 % significance level primary outcome small-dense LDL ( blood lipid ) . The investigator calculate 20 % participant drop end study , therefore investigator aim recruit total 24 participant . Secondary outcome body composition , gut microbiota , energy substrate utilization , exercise performance , rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) , hormone , cognition , sweet craving , experience follow two dietary regime . Study design : Study participant female nutrition student knowledge interest dietary survey , order increase motivation adherence . The woman weight stable maintain physical activity study , order evaluate diet affect various health parameter . Study participant provide food diet intervention . The amount source fat , protein carbohydrate two diet strictly define ; LCHF : Maximum 25 g carbohydrates/day ( approximately 5 E % ) , 20 E % protein 75 E % fat ( 35 E % saturate fat ) . NNR2012 : 50 E % carbohydrate , 20 E % protein 30 E % fat ( 10 E % saturate fat ) . Study participant randomize respect physical activity level one two study arm , crossover design : Study arm 1 : LHCF ( 4 week ) -- - washout ( 15 week ) -- - NNR ( 4 week ) Study arm 2 : NNR ( 4 week ) -- - washout ( 15 week ) -- - LCHF ( 4 week ) Study participant eat diet four week . The different diet separate washout period eat `` usual '' . Every morning four-week diet period participant measure urine ketone use urine ketone strip , weigh record body weight . Any discrepancy food intake record log book also daily physical activity level specify . Energy expenditure measure three day four week period use SenseWear activity meter ( validated objective method ) see energy intake match energy expenditure . Baseline- outcome measurement perform prior end four-week diet period . Qualitative measurement : When whole diet study complete research subject experience eat NNR LCHF diet interview conduct research subject . The study expect reveal whether LCHF healthy unhealthy diet short term . The investigator also expect data study helpful tool measure diet adherence future long-term study .</detailed_description>
