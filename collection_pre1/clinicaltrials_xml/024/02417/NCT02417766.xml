	<brief_summary>Background : - There many type immune disorder . These range rare immune deficiency allergies autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis . Genes instruction body use work develop . A new technology call whole exome sequencing may help find cause disorder . Whole exome sequence way look many gene error . Researchers hope find new gene change lead immune disorder . Additionally , researcher interest find best way manage unexpected important finding whole exome sequencing . Objectives : - To good understand genetic cause immune system disorder . Also , good understand people thoughts feeling immune system disorder new genomic testing . Eligibility : - People age 0 100 immune disorder relative immune disorder . People must least 2 evaluated NIH clinical center . People must least 12 survey/interview portion study . Design : - Participants gene sequence . They may ask new sample blood . - If participant come study visit , blood sample collect local lab doctor send mail . - Researchers may may find cause participant immune disorder . Participants learn information . Some participant may ask return NIH get result test . - Researchers may share information study . The data anonymous . - For survey part study , participant answer question relative immune disorder . They also answer thought feeling genomic testing . - Some participant ask brief interview ask survey topic . There may follow-up several month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) actively develop infrastructure capability identify cause heterogeneous immune-mediated disorder whole exome whole genome sequencing ( WES/WGS ) . This effort receive additional support establishment NIAID Clinical Genomics Program ( CGP ) , Division Intramural Research ( DIR ) -supported cross-lab collaboration increase effectiveness NIAID basic apply genomic research . The disorder investigation include primary immunodeficiency , immune homeostasis disorder , autoimmune condition , allergic disease hypothesize causative genetic mutation ( ) yet identify . Given recent discovery genetic base many immunological disorder , also expand disorder study include prominent extra-immune manifestation strong inherited immunological pathogenic basis identify ; Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders associate Streptococcal infection ( PANDAS ) Sydenham chorea . Despite breadth clinical presentation investigation , immune-mediated disorder share significant overlap underlie molecular pathophysiology thus represent coherent study target . This protocol facilitate discovery gene contribute select immune-mediated disorder well generate experience genetic secondary finding disclosure ass participant perception preference WES future secondary finding procedure . Ultimately , good understanding genetic contribution immune dysregulation provide valuable diagnostic , potentially , prognostic information affect family , also potential lead development novel therapeutic target . Further , develop experience-tested evidenced-based procedure secondary find management beneficial NIAID CGP researcher participant . This protocol specific genetic testing . Probands , affect person serve start point genetic study family , require enrol primary protocol , execute clinical research evaluation . Unaffected relative may enrol protocol . Participants unable travel National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center ( NIHCC ) may evaluate mailin blood sample , although evaluation NIHCC strongly prefer , particularly affected participant . This study aim enroll 200 participant exome sequencing , include patient relatives heterogeneous immune-mediate disorder ; participant receive exome sequence plus decline offer participation survey ( i.e. , accrual ceiling 200 ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Whole Exome Sequencing Secondary Findings Disclosure The following inclusion criterion apply research participant protocol : 1 . Age 0100 year old . Clinical evaluation NIHCC require age &gt; 2 year . Affected relative &lt; 2 year age may include genetic family study despite fact he/she young evaluation clinical center . Including affected relative familybased whole exome sequence critically important , even study team rely medical record NIHCC evaluation permit due age . 2 . Willingness allow share genetic information share control access database like dbGaP . 3 . Willingness receive secondary find report . Probands ( i.e. , affected individual serve start point genetic study family ) must : 1 . Primary enrollment NIH Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve protocol ( e.g. , 05I0213 93I0063 ) , execute majority clinical research evaluation . 2 . A suspected genetic basis present immune disorder feature include limited autoimmunity , autoinflammatory condition , lymphadenopathy , endorgan dysfunction , unusual infection , allergy , laboratory abnormality consistent immune dysregulation previously identify and/or family history suggest geneticallybased immune dysfunction ( e.g. , similar phenotype among relative and/or consanguinity ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any participant exclude following : 1 . Any condition opinion investigator may interfere research focus protocol .</criteria>
