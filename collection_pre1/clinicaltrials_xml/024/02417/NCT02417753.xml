	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people gastrointestinal ovarian cancer also ascites . That free fluid build abdomen . Researchers want see new drug affect immune cell ascites . This may also treat cancer . Objective : - To look immune marker ascites people gastrointestinal ovarian cancer . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 old malignancy GI tract metastatic ovarian cancer . As result , ascites abdomen . Design : - Participants screen : - Medical history , physical exam , blood test . - Echocardiogram : sound wave make image heart . - Electrocardiogram : measure electrical activity heart . - Paracentesis : needle inserted abdomen remove ascites fluid . - They may tumor biopsy . - Participants get AZD9150 vein 3 hour . They get 6 time cycle 1 4 time cycle . Each cycle 28 day . - Each cycle , participant : - Have physical exam . - Have blood test weekly . - Be ask feel medicine take . - After every 2 cycle ( every 2 month ) , participant scan x-rays tumor . - Participants paracentesis 2 time study . They another echocardiogram . - At end therapy , participant physical exam blood test . They ask feel medicine take .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AZD9150 , STAT3 Antisense Oligonucleotide , People With Malignant Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - STAT3 consider promising cancer drug target pleiotropic involvement tumorigenesis . STAT3 regulate expression many gene directly important survival tumor cell , also important factor non-tumor cell tumor microenvironment involve immune evasion tumor cell , angiogenesis , metastasis . - AZD9150 antisense oligonucleotide design target down-regulate expression human STAT3 mRNA . - By focus patient malignant ascites feasible u sample tumor environment frequently , example , conventional tumor tissue biopsy . Malignant ascites relatively common occurrence ovarian gastrointestinal malignancy , impact greatly quality life . Objectives : -To measure change immune parameter malignant ascites patient advanced cancer follow therapy AZD9150 . Select Eligibility : - Age great equal 18 year . - Histologically confirm metastatic ovarian GI malignancy malignant ascites . Patients must ascites amenable paracentesis . - Patient relapse refractory least one prior chemotherapy regimen , patient standard therapy exist Design : - Up N=15 eligible patient receive AZD9150 follow schedule : - Cycle 1 : AZD9150 administer intravenously Cycle 1 Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 15 22 . - Cycle 2 beyond : AZD9150 administer intravenous infusion every week without break , i.e . Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 28-day cycle . - Patients re-staged every 8 week . - Patients undergo baseline pretreatment paracentesis repeat Cycle 1 Days 8 15 . An optional paracentesis may attempt D57 treatment ( whichever happen first ) . Immune subsets analysis baseline biopsy/ascites/PBMC post AZD9150 surgical specimen , ascites PBMC analyze . STAT3 activation status also assess tumor cell isolate malignant ascites various time point .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm GI malignancy ovarian cancer prior enter study . 2 . Histologically confirm metastatic ovarian GI malignancy malignant ascites amenable paracentesis . Adjudication malignant ascites make clinical ground e.g . absence cirrhosis nonmalignant cause ascites . 3 . Patients relapse refractory least one prior chemotherapy regimen , standard therapy exist . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . 4 . Patients radiation therapy , chemotherapy , investigational agent , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy 4 week ( 5 halflives therapy , whichever long ) prior first dose study , Bevacizumab 6 week . 5 . Age great equal 18 year . 6 . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 70 % ) 7 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL without growthfactor support past month platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL time screening period without platelet transfusion within 3 week total bilirubin &lt; 2 X institutional upper limit normal Hb great equal 9 g/dL without transfusion 3 week INR &lt; 2.0 AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3 X institutional upper limit normal , &lt; 5 ULN patient liver metastasis Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR 8 . Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy , include surgery . Toxicity &lt; grade 1 9 . Ejection fraction &gt; 50 % echocardiogram . 10 . The effect AZD9150 develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential use reliable method contraception time screen 6 month discontinue study treatment . Acceptable method contraception include tubal ligation , tricycle combine oral transdermal contraceptive , copperbanded intrauterine device vasectomize partner . It know whether AZD9150 capacity induce hepatic enzyme hormonal contraceptive combine barrier method contraception . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior entry . Male patient use reliable method contraception barrier contraception i.e . condom sexual activity woman childbearing potential refrain sperm donation trial washout period least 6 month . If male patient wish father child advise arrange freeze sperm sample prior start study treatment . 11 . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients receive investigational agent . 2 . History prior JAK STAT3 inhibitor treatment . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis spinal cord compression exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 4 . Patients must invasive malignancy within past 3 year ( exception adequately treat basal squamous cell skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) breast ) . 5 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition AZD9150 . 6 . Incompletely heal surgical incision prior enrolment 7 . Ongoing therapy oral parenteral anticoagulant ( e.g. , heparin , warfarin ) . Lowdose anticoagulant maintenance catheter patency exclusionary . 8 . Any following cardiac criterion : Mean rest correct QT interval ( QTcF ) &gt; 480 msec obtain 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) Any clinically important abnormality rhythm , conduction morphology rest ECG e.g. , complete leave bundle branch block , third degree heart block 9 .
