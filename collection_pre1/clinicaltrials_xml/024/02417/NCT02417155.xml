	<brief_summary>Inflammatory cytokine play pivotal role rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) innovative non-pharmacological therapy aim limiting cytokine production highly warrant . Adrenaline , neurotransmitter autonomic sympathetic nervous system , attenuate cytokine production . Along line , endogenous modulation sympathetic activity could limit inflammation therefore represent treatment modality would empower RA patient exert self-control disease activity . However , autonomic nervous system inflammatory response regard system voluntarily influence . Nevertheless , result two recent study demonstrate possible technique develop 'iceman ' Wim Hof , namely meditation , exposure cold , breathe exercise . Hof healthy volunteer train able voluntarily activate sympathetic nervous system , result adrenaline release subsequent suppression inflammatory response experimental human endotoxemia ( model systemic inflammation elicit administration lipopolysaccharide [ LPS ] healthy volunteer ) . Interestingly , teach three technique , endotoxemia experiment train subject ( like Hof ) predominantly practice breathing exercise consist two different technique . A ` hyper/hypoventilation ` technique , characterize cycle hyperventilation follow breath retention ` strength ventilation ` technique consist deep inhalation exhalation follow breath hold . These technique result intermittent hypoxia cyclic shift acid-base balance . Based observation previous study , investigator hypothesize breathe technique account increased production adrenaline thus suppress inflammatory response unclear two technique important .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Increasing Plasma Adrenaline Levels Through Breathing Techniques - Explorative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective study compare increase plasma adrenaline level two different breathe technique group healthy volunteer train Hof . Also , investigator investigate whether necessary train Hof relatively short instruction instead extensive training sufficient . Additionally , investigator want evaluate influence train breathe technique pain threshold .</detailed_description>
