	<brief_title>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation ( FMT ) Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , severe form fatty liver disease , highly prevalent lead cirrhosis , liver failure hepatocellular carcinoma . It strongly associate obesity metabolic syndrome . The impact gut microbiota obesity metabolic syndrome potentially large increase evidence suggest dysbiosis might contribute development NASH . There fundamental gap understanding alteration intestinal microbiota lead wide range metabolic syndrome associate condition include fatty liver disease human . The long-term goal project well understand mechanism link intestinal dysbiosis extra-intestinal clinical phenotype , particular obesity NAFLD . Compositional shift gut bacteria antibiotic use perpetuate disease Clostridum difficile infection , manipulation microbiota stool transplant healthy donor use cure disease . The objective application determine whether restoration beneficial gut microbiota via fecal microbiota transplantation use stool lean donor ( FMT-L ) improve NASH . The central hypothesis project transfer gut microbiota lean donor result reduce hepatic steatosis , improved histological biochemical feature NASH , correlate observe change small bowel distal gut microbiome . This hypothesis test pursue 3 specific aim : 1 ) determine effect FMT-L patient NASH hepatic steatosis marker NASH ; 2 ) perform microbiome analyse pre- post-FMT-L small bowel &amp; stool sample ; 3 ) investigate mechanistic correlate link dysbiosis histologic change NASH FMT-L . The study pilot open label trial examine effect FMT-L patient biopsy proven NASH . The primary outcome measure change MRI-determined hepatic fat fraction,12 week transplantation . Differences microbiota FMT-L small bowel distal gut , include durability microbiota change , examine use advanced metagenomic technique . Clinical laboratory feature metabolic syndrome obesity well hepatic systemic inflammatory marker examine mechanistic correlate link dysbiosis histologic change liver . In addition understand gut microbiota affect fatty liver disease progression , study finding provide framework future microbiome research metabolic syndrome relate disease diabetes , obesity , inflammatory disorder . An increased understanding human gut microbiota alter metabolic disease may open new avenue therapeutic base manipulation gut bacteria .</detailed_description>
