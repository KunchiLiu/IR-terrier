	<brief_summary>Chronic Pain ( CP ) management increasingly utilized long-term opioid analgesic therapy , change associate increase opioid abuse ( via great exposure vulnerable individual ) , non-pain health consequence ( hormone change , fall ) , dramatic rise opioid-related overdoses death . Treatment strategy minimize need chronic high-dose opioids sorely need . This project test novel hypothesis effective pain relief achieve low opioid analgesic dos increase level endogenous opioids ( EOs ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Opioid Analgesic Requirements Via Improved Endogenous Opioid Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project determine whether enhance endogenous opioids ( via aerobic exercise training ) permit achieve desire level analgesia low dosage opioid analgesic , few side effect abuse-relevant drug effect . This 4 year project test study hypotheses sample 116 chronic low back pain patient . The study two key element : 1 ) randomize , control aerobic exercise manipulation CP patient complete daily electronic pain diary 2 ) laboratory evoke thermal pain protocol pre- post-exercise permit direct examination change opioid analgesic effect ( response series incremental morphine dos ) EO activity ( indexed compare pain response placebo vs. opioid blockade ) . The study employ mixed between/within-subjects design use double-blind , counterbalance , placebo-controlled administration opioid antagonist ( naloxone ) opioid agonist ( morphine ) . The study use 6 week supervise aerobic exercise manipulation , subject randomly assign exercise protocol exercise control condition . All participant undergo three identical laboratory pain-induction session ( â‰ˆ5 day apart ) prior randomization experimental condition , end 6 week exercise manipulation period ( regardless exercise group assignment ) receive 3 study drug participate control laboratory evaluation evoke thermal pain responsiveness .</detailed_description>
