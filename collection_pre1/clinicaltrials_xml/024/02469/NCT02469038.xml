	<detailed_description>Peripheral venous cannulation among common procedure perform clinical setting prerequisite fluid resuscitation , administration medication , diagnostic test [ 1,2 ] . In United States , approximately 300 million peripheral intravenous catheter ( PIV ) insert annually [ 1 ] , 25 % visit emergency department require intravenous catheter parenteral fluid administration [ 3 ] . Providers emergency department become adept establish peripheral venous access , estimate PIV insertion fail 6 million patient annually [ 1 ] . Many factor think associate difficult venous access , typically define least two fail attempt establish intravenous access [ 3 ] . Intravenous drug abuse , obesity , multiple hospitalization , chronic medical problem include diabetes , sickle cell disease , end-stage renal disease , cancer predispose factor difficult venous access [ 2-5 ] . Prior study report prevalence difficult venous access range 8 % 23 % [ 2-5 ] . Failure establish peripheral venous access emergency department costly problem , lead delay diagnostics treatment require alternative site vascular access external jugular , intraosseous , central venous access [ 3 ] . These alternative method lead high complication rate , decrease patient satisfaction , increase utilization nurse physician time [ 6 ] . Central venous catheterization , often use traditional venous cannulation method fail , overall complication rate 15 % , complication include arterial puncture , pneumothorax , deep vein thrombosis , infection [ 7,8 ] . These complication pose significant financial burden healthcare system , cost associate single central venous catheter relate infection 2002 estimate $ 34,508 $ 56,000 median payout claim result central venous catheter relate injury $ 100,7502 . In past decade , ultrasound guidance greatly improved process localizing vessel cannulation , especially patient abnormal vascular anatomy difficult venous access , thereby provide many benefit landmark-based technique . Ultrasound guide venous cannulation date back 1984 , Legler Nugent show single pas success rate internal jugular ( IJ ) cannulation could improve 77.3 % use Doppler ultrasound versus 28.6 % traditional landmark-based approach [ 9 ] . Since report real-time ultrasonographic guidance IJ catheter placement Yonei et al . 1986 [ 10 ] , ultrasound guide central venous cannulation repeatedly show increase success rate , decrease complication rate , improve patient satisfaction [ 1,2,11-15 ] . Based advantage offer ultrasound guidance , Agency Healthcare Research Quality recommend real-time ultrasonographic guidance central venous access [ 13,16 ] . The ultrasound-guided approach adapt peripheral venous access emergency department Keyes et al . uncontrolled study demonstrate 91 % success rate ultrasound-guided cannulation brachial basilica vein [ 17 ] . A subsequent control study validate high success rate ultrasonographic ( 97 % ) versus control ( 33 % ) group patient identify difficult PIV access also show ultrasonographic group require less time successful cannulation , few percutaneous puncture , result great patient satisfaction traditional landmark-based approach [ 13 ] . Furthermore , ultrasound-guidance peripheral venous cannulation show prevent need central venous catheterization 85 % patient difficult venous access [ 2 ] use 40 % few kit per patient landmark-guided placement catheter [ 11,18 ] . In healthcare climate increasingly focus outcomes cost-effectiveness , ultrasound-guided peripheral venous cannulation become viable often preferred method patient difficult venous access . Nevertheless , study date ultrasound-guided peripheral venous cannulation reveal shortcoming . Conventional IV catheter place ultrasound guidance prone premature failure failure rate 8 % [ 7,17 ] first hour placement 47 % first 24 hour , commonly due infiltration [ 7 ] . These failure rate significantly high compare 2 % 24 hour 10 % day 4 , report standard peripheral IV catheter [ 7,19 ] . Moreover , overall success rate range 90 % 100 % multiple attempt [ 2,7,13,20 ] , first attempt success rate less impressive , range 46 % 71 % [ 13,20 ] . Our study ass whether AccuCath catheter integrate guidewire address shortcoming demonstrate superiority conventional PIV catheter across clinical outcome relevant emergency department set . While catheter guidewires long use place central arterial line , largely absent PIV placement . The AccuCath catheter differentiate conventional IV catheter two principal way . The catheter material consist polyether block amide , thermoplastic elastomer softness flexibility design decrease vessel wall irritation mechanical phlebitis [ 21 ] . In addition , integrate guidewire facilitates catheter insertion limit vessel damage [ 21 ] . A prospective , randomize , control study show first attempt success rate 89 % catheter guidewire versus 47 % conventional IV along low complication rate 8 % cathether guidewire 52 % conventional IVs [ 21 ] . This study perform inpatient setting patient receive elective , non-emergent PIVs [ 21 ] . Our study important determine whether AccuCath 's superior first attempt success rate low complication rate replicate emergent PIVs emergency department set . These improvement could translate cost saving decrease utilization physician nursing time , few number PIV catheter use , high patient satisfaction fewer percutaneous puncture , less complication infiltration phlebitis . The objective study : 1 . In patient fail traditional non-ultrasound IV catheter placement , compare ultrasound-guided cannulation AccuCath catheter versus ultrasound-guided cannulation conventional IV catheter ED patient across follow clinical parameter : first attempt success rate , procedure time point first percutaneous puncture successful cannulation , total number percutaneous puncture require successful cannulation , total number IV catheter require successful cannulation . 2 . Assess patient provider satisfaction catheter system 5-point Likert scale . 3 . Check clinical demographic difference patient group successfully cannulate first attempt versus require multiple attempt . We hypothesize : 1 . Ultrasound-guided cannulation AccuCath IV catheter demonstrate high first attempt success rate , require less procedure time , require few percutaneous puncture , utilize few catheter ultrasound-guided cannulation conventional IV catheter ED patient . 2 . Patients provider satisfy AccuCath IV catheter versus conventional IV catheter ED set . 3 . There statistically significant clinical demographic difference patient group successfully cannulate first attempt versus require multiple attempt .</detailed_description>
