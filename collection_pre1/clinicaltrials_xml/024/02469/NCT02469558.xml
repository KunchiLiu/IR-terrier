	<detailed_description>Obesity diabetes probably represent challenge threat public health 21st century . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) predict 2015 approximately 2.3 billion adult overweight ( BMI 25-29.9 kg/m² ) , 700 million obese ( BMI 30 kg/m² ) . In addition , currently 285 million people worldwide suffer type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , number predict increase 439 million 2030 . T2DM raise risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality , well eye problem , nerve damage kidney disease . Previous study demonstrate impact diabetes everyday life likelihood costly disable complication reduce intensive management glucose , blood pressure cholesterol . Weight reduction desire also difficult achieve treatment option obesity , able prevent secondary complication obesity T2DM . Since weight reduction diet increase physical activity alone difficult achieve morbidly obese subject , , aggressive approach , bariatric surgery invent . Recent preclinical clinical study indicate important influence intestinal microbiome ( gut metagenome ) obesity associate metabolic disorder ( metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes , metabolic liver disease , cardiovascular disease ) . For instance , cecum microbiota rodent find significantly different obese lean mouse . This finding alter gut microbiota confirm extended human . Additionally , investigation human demonstrate obese people lose weight , composition microflora shift , closely resembled lean individual . This suggest microflora might involve pathogenesis obesity , insulin resistance T2DM impact gut permeability chronic inflammation . Probiotic , prebiotic synbiotic intervention show effective modulating gut permeability gut microbiota animal thereby modulate chronic inflammation metabolic disorder animal model . In human show unequivocally far . However , yet unknown , benefit intervention individual respond differently intervention . The aim study investigate compare thoroughly effect multispecies probiotic glycaemic control , gut microbiota gut permeability patient metabolic syndrome diabetes . The investigator aim access change insulin sensitivity , islet function secretion gut hormone . In addition , investigator investigate change gut microbiota gut permeability understand underlie mechanism . After investigate mechanism overarch aim identify biomarkers , would allow good prediction treatment success . In future would allow tailor obesity diabetes treatment order give every patient optimal treatment low cost .</detailed_description>
