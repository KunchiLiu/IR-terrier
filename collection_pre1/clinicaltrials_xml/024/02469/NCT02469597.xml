	<brief_title>Single Dose Furosemide Improve Respiratory Distress Moderate Severe Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomization Blinding : Subjects randomly assign 1:1 ratio either furosemide placebo . The Biostatistics Unit develop randomization procedure use permuted block design . The randomization stratify mode delivery furosemide : IV PO . Blinding maintain time throughout study . The unblinded study personnel pharmacy department dispense either placebo furosemide patient . Blinding broken case allergic reaction case pediatric attend physician , involve study ( designate prior study initiation ) notify access intervention patient . If event occur , primary investigator IRB notify e-mail/phone , adverse event document . Materials / Methods : All patient age 0-4 year old primary diagnosis bronchiolitis assessment Emergency Department evaluate inclusion study . The goal patient enrollment 100 patient , require achieve statistical significance ( see ) . As study focus moderate ( admit ) severe ( require mechanical ventilation ) patient bronchiolitis , documentation would complete data collection sheet . Randomization occur upon consent study . In collaboration Biostatistics Unit , patient randomly assign 1:1 ratio either furosemide placebo . There randomization procedure use permuted block design . The randomization stratify mode delivery intervention : IV PO . The corresponding intervention ( placebo furosemide ) dispense pharmacy administration blind manner patient 's nurse and/or physician . Either single dose furosemide ( 1mg/kg 10mg - whichever less ) administer orally PO ( intravenously [ IV ] IV present ) , placebo equal volume . Ideally , intervention dose administer early possible ( immediately decision admit make consent obtain ) . Subsequent retrieval data do study personnel . Data record data collection sheet include : O2 Saturation/Weight ( pre-intervention , 2 4 hour post-furosemide/control ) , Age , Gender , Prematurity ( &lt; 32 week gestation ) , history mechanical ventilation , history wheeze / asthma , history furosemide use , intervention prior furosemide ( racemic epinephrine , albuterol , non-invasive ventilation ) , RSV / Influenza status , degree dehydration ( mild / moderate / severe ) , onset symptom prior triage , +/- apnea , time initiation visit furosemide administration and/or non-invasive/invasive ventilator support , reason admission ICU necessary . Considerations analysis : All analysis carry intention treat principle ; patient analyzed accord group randomize . ( However , likely intention treat population per protocol population . ) The primary analysis carry patient . Mode delivery furosemide ( IV vs. PO ) include analysis , aim study examine effect furosemide , regardless mode delivery . Randomization stratify mode delivery , distribution mode delivery two treatment group . Secondary subgroup analysis perform analyze mode delivery ( IV , PO ) , separately . These secondary subgroup analyse primary analysis . Analyses Specific Aims : 1 . The association treatment ( furosemide ) control ( placebo ) group compare use chi-square test categorical outcome ( 25 % decrease respiratory rate , intubation , etc ) . Percent change respiratory rate compare use two sample t-test . If usual assumption require t-test met , either suitable transformation , appropriate non-parametric test ( Mann-Whitney test ) , use . Length stay ( LOS ) compare use Mann-Whitney test . In event participant follow discharge hospital ( in-hospital mortality , discharge end study period ) , survival method use ( LOS estimate use product-limit method , treatment group compare use log-rank test ) . Sample Size Justification : Based clinical experience , believe patient admit bronchiolitis response ( described primary outcome : decrease respiratory rate 25 % , return age appropriate respiration rate ) , 2 hour post administration placebo . To conservative , assumed response placebo high 5 % . It believe clinically meaningful response rate would 25 % patient 2 hour administration furosemide . The propose sample size 49 subject per group yield 80 % power detect difference use chi-square test 0.05 significance level . Clinical Outcomes Justification : Given transient nature bronchiolitis , symptom typically peak treatment sought . Along furosemide 's half life approximately 6hrs , could correlation drawn child intubate ( respiratory failure ) , relate furosemide give . Twenty-four hour reasonable observation period correlate intervention . Intubation beyond time point may infer similar treatment furosemide warrant give disease .</detailed_description>
