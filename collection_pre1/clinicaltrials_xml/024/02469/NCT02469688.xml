	<brief_title>A Study ASP4070 Confirm Safety Immunological Response Patients With Pollen Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist 2 part : Part 1 Part 2 . [ Part 1 ] An open-label , un-controlled study Examine safety ASP4070 intramuscular vaccination group ( high dose x 4 time ) ASP4070 intradermal vaccination group ( high dose x 4 time ) . [ Part 2 ] A placebo-controlled , double-blinded , randomize , parallel-group comparative study Assess immunological response safety ASP 4070 intramuscular vaccination group ( high dose x 1 time high dose x 4 time ) ASP4070 intradermal vaccination group ( low dose x 1 time , low x 4 time , high dose x 1 time , high dose x 4 time ) compare placebo group . The study double-blinded within route vaccination , non-blinded route vaccination ( intramuscular vaccination group intradermal vaccination group ) . The first vaccination subject Part 2 start least 14 day first vaccination subject Part 1 ( 6 subject ) . For Part 1 Part 2 , primary study period 3 month start last dose study drug Day 43 ( Day 127 ) . After primary study period , safety information collect 9 month ( 1 year last dose study drug ) long-term safety follow-up study period . Safety information collect 1 year start last vaccination study drug also patient discontinue participation study primary study period patient agree .</detailed_description>
