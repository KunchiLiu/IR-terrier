	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine feasibility use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image technology image cancer [ 18F ] FluorThanatrace ( [ 18F ] FTT ) , new radioactive tracer compound develop image poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP-1 ) activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP1 ) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair enzyme enable normal cell survival well certain cancer . Pharmaceutical company invest heavily PARP1 inhibitor development agent effectively treat certain cancer single agent , thus spar patient chemotherapy toxicity . However , clinical trial test PARP1 inhibitor demonstrate mixed result due inability measure degree PARP1 inhibition tumor reliably . Accurately measure tumoral PARP1 activity level PARP1 inhibitor treatment : ( 1 ) enable identification patient whose tumor exhibit PARP activity therefore good candidate PARP inhibitor therapy , ( 2 ) confirm adequate dos PARP1 inhibitor administer patient , thus improve dose selection study clinical trial . Thus , noninvasive approach measure tumoral PARP1 activity would commercialization potential supporting development PARP1 inhibitor also Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval assess clinical PARP1 inhibitor treatment response . Inflammation also contribute number disease involve lung organ . Increasing evidence suggest PARP1 may also play central role modulate immune inflammatory response . Thus , data trial also use develop approach study lung inflammatory response . A new radiolabeled compound , [ 18F ] FluorThanatrace ( [ 18F ] FTT ) , generate used measure PARP1 activity noninvasively quantitatively use positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Our data cancer model show uptake compound specific PARP1 activity correlate biochemically determine PARP1 activity . Additional preliminary data also suggest decrease [ 18F ] FTT uptake predicts tumor response PARP inhibition olaparib , PARP1 inhibitor currently evaluate clinical trial . Therefore , investigator conduct Phase 0 trial develop [ 18F ] FTT clinical use cancer patient . To date , biomarkers develop beyond genetic test breast cancer 1 2 ( BRCA1/2 ) mutation aid patient selection treatment PARP inhibition . Moreover , technology available monitor efficacy PARP inhibition . Our technology provide biomarker patient selection well mean monitor PARP activity treatment .</detailed_description>
