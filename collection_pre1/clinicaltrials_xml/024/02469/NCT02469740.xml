	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease remain common cause death Ireland . Usage antiplatelet agent cardiac procedure coronary angioplasty dramatically improve morbidity mortality associate coronary artery disease . In patient coronary stent , dual antiplatelet therapy recommend . Aspirin main antiplatelet agent use . For many year , clopidogrel second antiplatelet choice . Recent study reveal new antiplatelet drug substitute clopidogrel , one ticagrelor . Ticagrelor receive approval regulatory authority Food Drug Administration European Medicines Agency base PLATO trial demonstrate reduction overall mortality thrombotic cardiovascular event compare clopidogrel . Ticagrelor approve Europe specifically Ireland use patient ACS patient undergo coronary angioplasty . The degree ticagrelor reduce overall mortality compare clopidogrel PLATO trial suggest ticagrelor possibly pleiotropic effect reduction mortality simply due antiplatelet effect . The ticagrelor molecule resembles adenosine . It show ticagrelor increase adenosine concentration , interfere red blood cell ' uptake inducing release ATP convert adenosine . Adenosine show cardioprotective . Peripheral Arterial Tonometry ( EndoPAT 2000 system ( Itamar Medical , Caesarea , Israel ) method evaluate endothelial dysfunction . The device receive CE mark ( approve use Europe ) . It use non-invasive assessment call fingertip pulse amplitude tonometry . The reactive hyperaemia response detect reactive hyperaemia index ( RHI ) show related multiple traditional metabolic risk factor . It also find positively correlate flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) coronary vasoreactivity assess intracoronary acetylcholine . A significant advantage endoPAT device reproducibility result compare FMD assessment peripheral endothelial function . Smaller study show positive effect ticagrelor endothelial function assessment compare clopidogrel prasugrel randomise study do date . The aim project study effect ticagrelor arterial system use noninvasive method . The study employ measurement peripheral endothelial function patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel use cross trial design .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must able willing give write informed consent comply requirement study protocol Subjects must male female , age 18 year baseline Diagnosed coronary artery disease undergone PCI Female subject child bear potential must willing ensure partner use effective contraception study 12 month ( per guideline patient undergo PCI antiplatelet therapy ) . Female subject ' urine pregnancy test perform baseline visit must negative ( require local hospital policy order undergo PCI ) . Allergy/hypersensitivity study medication ingredient Contraindications either clopidogrel ticagrelor : Ticagrelor contraindication active bleeding , history intracranial haemorrhage , moderate severe hepatic impairment , dialysis , uric acid nephropathy , coadministration strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( e.g . ketoconazole , clarithromycin , nefazodone , ritonavir atazanavir ) , history sick sinus syndrome high degree AV block without pacemaker protection Clopidogrel contraindication severe hepatic impairment , active bleeding On treatment oral anticoagulant ( vitamin K antagonist , dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban ) Unable follow research centre ( example , due logistic difficulty ) Female subject pregnant breastfeeding , consider become pregnant study . Subjects participate another study receive investigational agent within previous 12 month Subjects unable provide write informed consent within 24 hour PCI ( example , intubated patient ) Subjects history drug alcohol use , opinion investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement .
