	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , observational registry document baseline , 24-hour 30-day inflammatory response procedural outcomes 12 month follow-up femoropopliteal angioplasty atherectomy-based revascularization procedure . 1 . To observe femoropopliteal revascularization outcomes post-angioplasty and/or atherectomy observe potential correlation patency outcomes level MCP-1 , C-reactive protein MMP-9 baseline 24 hour 30 day post-procedure . 2 . To provide comparator dataset investigational DANCE trial , enrollment criterion observational trial include investigational use local drug therapy limit inflammation cause mechanical revascularization .</detailed_description>
