	<brief_summary>Arterial venous thrombus play important role various vascular disease myocardial infarction , stroke , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) pulmonary embolism . These thromboembolic disorder lead cause morbidity mortality worldwide . A non-invasive method quantitative effective detection thrombus whole body yet establish . In spite available technique , 30 % 40 % ischemic stroke `` cryptogenic '' ( undetermined cause , source thromboembolism never identify ) . Possible cause cryptogenic stroke atherosclerosis include aortic arch intracranial artery . A plaque arch large vessel could important source cryptogenic stroke , however , difficult detect routine method . The approach thrombus target molecular imaging could identify potentially troublesome plaque early become dangerous rupture . The hypothesis radiotracer 18F-arterial GP1 venous thrombus use positron emission tomography ( PET ) make visible . The primary goal potential applicability substance PET tracer diagnose thrombus .</brief_summary>
