	<brief_summary>Study 201682 Phase IIa , randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled four arm outpatient study evaluate safety , tolerability clinical effect danirixin danirixin + oseltamivir combination comparison placebo oseltamivir twice daily 5 day otherwise healthy adult laboratory confirm influenza infection . Danirixin selective reversible C-X-C Chemokine Receptor 2 ( CXCR2 ) antagonist inhibits neutrophil transmigration activation area inflammation . The study endpoint intend test hypothesis inhibition neutrophil activation approximately 50-60 % ( previously measure cluster differentiation [ CD11b ] expression response chemokine [ C-X-C motif ] ligand 1 [ CXCL1 ] stimulation ex vivo human study ) impact safety parameter worsen clinical manifestation disease , disease-related event interest , viral load , may possibly improve parameter administer within 48 hour symptom onset . The aim exploratory study obtain data safety , tolerability clinical effect GSK1325756 ( danirixin [ DNX ] ) alone combination oseltamivir ( OSV ) otherwise healthy adult acute , uncomplicated influenza prior future evaluation hospitalize patient complicate influenza . The primary objective ass safety tolerability DNX without neuraminidase inhibitor evaluation AEs , SAEs , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameter . Safety assessment also include assessment disease related event ( DREs ) interest associate antibiotic use . The Influenza Intensity Impact Questionnaire ( FluiiQ™ ) use study document patient report outcomes ( PROs ) . The screen visit Australia compose pre-screen influenza infection influenza rapid antigen test follow screen remain eligibility criterion subject positive result influenza rapid antigen test .
