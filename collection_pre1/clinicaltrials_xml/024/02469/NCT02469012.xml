	<brief_summary>The present study evaluate neurocognitive performance well measure mood , quality life , fatigue patient chronic hepatitis C infection . In prospective longitudinal study design , include patient monitor , , long-term follow-up interferon-free antiviral treatment ( Sofosbuvir +/-Daclatasvir +/- Ribavirin Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir +/- Ribavirin ) . Main study goal compare post therapy result sustain virologic responder correspond pretreatment value well historic interferon-treatment patient without virological response . It expect HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptom neurocognitive impairment - least part - reversible successful application modern IFN-free antiviral medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C one frequent infectious disease worldwide major cause chronic liver disease . At diagnosis , approximately 20 % patient chronic hepatitis C already liver cirrhosis . Therapy hepatitis C meanwhile reach high level efficacy effectiveness : present , 90 % patient treat combination peginterferon alfa , ribavirin sofosbuvir 12 week reach sustained loss hepatitis C virus . Psychiatric side effect interferon alfa well know may require dose reduction even premature discontinuation therapy . As patient interferon treatment sometimes report concentration memory impairment case interfere considerably capacity manage requirement everyday life , investigator plan intend conduct prospective longitudinal study evaluate - among parameter - neurocognitive performance , , therapy antiviral IFN-free therapy . In previously perform scientific work , investigator able show interferon-based combination therapy chronic hepatitis C may cause reversible impairment neurocognitive performance treatment period . Moreover , investigator recently demonstrate successful IFN-based antiviral treatment ( criterion : SVR , sustain virological response ) lead significant improvement relevant aspects attentional neurocognitive performance . These result indicate HCV-related neurocognitive impairment potentially reversible . Nevertheless , still open question important issue address connection field research , especially regard several aspect IFN-free antiviral therapy : Questions answer : - At least 12 month end successfully perform IFN-free antiviral treatment - psychometrically assess parameter related patient ' quality life , fatigue , neurocognitive performance , mood significantly improve compare pretreatment ( i.e. , baseline ) value ? - At least12 month end antiviral treatment , significant difference patient without sustained virological response ( special historical group IFN-treated patient without sustained virological response ) respect neurocognitive performance , emotional state , fatigue quality life ? - In absence clinically significant liver damage patient chronic hepatitis C - mere presence hepatitis C virus significant influence neurocognitive attentional performance ? Is possible confirm respective finding yield context former interferon-based treatment regimen ? - With current upcoming IFN-free treatment option - still significant therapy-related change symptom area neurocognitive performance , mood fatigue ? Study Design : Prospective monocentric study longitudinal repeat measure design include hepatitis C patient indication standard IFN-free antiviral therapy ( sofosbuvir/daclatasvir +/- ribavirin ; sofosbuvir/ledipasvir +/- ribavirin ) long-term follow-up quality life , neurocognitive performance , fatigue , emotional state . Planned sample size : n = 30 hepatitis C patient .</detailed_description>
