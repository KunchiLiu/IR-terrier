	<brief_title>Modulation Gut Microbiota Early Sepsis : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis systemic deleterious host response infection cause major healthcare problem . Sepsis affect million people around world year , lethality 25 % -50 % . The incidence increase partly raise average age occurrence predisposing disease population , partly shifts causative pathogen . Effectiveness therapy administer initial hour severe sepsis critically influence clinical outcome patient . Lacking reliable biomarkers early stage , diagnosis ( severe ) sepsis relies combination surrogate parameter indicate end organ dysfunction . Recently , gut wall integrity identify key feature protect body potentially harmful compound bacteria , toxin antigen . The gut barrier consist mucus barrier , antimicrobial peptide , secretory IgA , epithelial barrier , gut immune system . Gut permeability report increase sepsis play key role development multi-organ dysfunction . Therefore , gut permeability marker might potential predict risk progression sepsis severe sepsis . The mechanisms lead increased gut permeability completely clear , yet . Direct indirect interaction pathogen , hormonal imbalance , beta-adrenergic activity , hyperglycemia cytokine activation well individual predisposition propose . It seem increase gut permeability common final pathway multitude influence factor . Furthermore , importance gut microbiota composition recently recognize several disease ; however , much know role microbiome sepsis date . Available data suggest , disturbances microbiome homeostasis present sepsis , yet unknown change cause consequence sepsis . Changes gut barrier and/or gut microbiota lead increase microbial product circulation , contribute ( inadequate ) activation later `` paralysis '' immune cell . It yet know gut microbiome patient early stage sepsis differs healthy microbiome microbiome patient late stage sepsis . Also , possibility modulate gut microbiome early sepsis study yet . A typical strategy modulate gut microbiome use probiotic bacteria . In sepsis , use probiotic well establish specific indication , necrotising enterocolitis neonate , however , study adults scarce . Therefore aim study investigate ingestion multispecies probiotic early sepsis able modulate gut microbiota and/or gut permeability observe clinical outcome treat patient .</detailed_description>
