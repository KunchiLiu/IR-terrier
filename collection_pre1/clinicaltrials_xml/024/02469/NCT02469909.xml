Decannulation : In immediate decannulation group - tracheostomy tube remove patient would monitor overnight intermediate monitor unit . On next day clinical evaluation would hold , patient would discharge transfer department accord clinical course patient . In gradual decannulation group : The tracheostomy tube reduce 2 size compare initial inner diameter tube . The patient remain reduced tube 48 hour , tube remove patient would meet pre-decannulation evaluation . 3 . Follow : All patient would follow 7 , 30 , 90 day follow decannulation outpatient clinic department still hospitalize . In visit questionnaire regard possible respiratory complication document .</detailed_description>
