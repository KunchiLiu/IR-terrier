	<brief_title>A Transdiagnostic Sleep Circadian Treatment Improve Community SMI Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advance treatment , severe mental illness ( SMI ) remain common , chronic difficult treat . SMI define least one mental disorder last 12-months lead substantial life interference . Sleep circadian dysfunction among prominent correlate SMI , yet minimally study way reflect complexity sleep problem experience people SMI . In SMI , sleep circadian dysfunction undermines affect regulation , cognitive function physical health , predict onset worsen symptom often chronic even evidence-based SMI treatment . Prior treatment study disorder-focused—they treat specific sleep problem ( e.g. , insomnia ) specific diagnostic group ( e.g. , depression ) . However , real life sleep circadian problem neatly categorize , particularly SMI feature insomnia overlap hypersomnia , delay sleep phase irregular sleep-wake schedule . Accordingly , aim test hypothesis Transdiagnostic Intervention Sleep Circadian Dysfunction ( TranS-C ) improve functional impairment , disorder-focused symptom sleep circadian functioning . We recruit participant across DSM diagnose across common sleep circadian problem . The element TranS-C efficacious across SMI research setting research-based provider . The next step test TranS-C community setting community-based provider . Accordingly , propose conduct 'efficacy real world ' randomize control trial within Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services ( ACBHCS ) , community mental health center ( CMHC ) Alameda County . We recruit 120 adult diagnose SMI sleep circadian dysfunction within ACBHCS . Individuals randomly allocate TranS-C ( n = 60 ) 6-months Usual Care follow Delayed Treatment TranS-C ( UC-DT ; n = 60 ) . TranS-C modularized deliver across eight twelve 50-minute , weekly , individual session . All participant assess , immediately follow treatment ( ie . 9-14 week later ) 6 month later .</detailed_description>
