	<detailed_description>The purpose study use tissue decease organ donor address question importance development regenerative cellular therapy well understand organ physiology developmental biology . This study aim maximise clinically available data well patient benefit generate donated tissue . It also aim reduce number consent form give patient consolidate coordinate number related investigation . The study aim : - To examine function immune response stem cell differentiate progeny well development immunomodulatory approach prevent rejection . - Generation induce pluripotent stem cell ( iPSCs ) subsequent differentiation functional cell potential therapy . - Generation differentiate cell native adult stem cell cellular therapy . - Investigation organ physiology .</detailed_description>
