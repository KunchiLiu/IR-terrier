	<brief_title>Accuracy Surgeon-performed Ultrasound Detecting Gallstones - Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrolment patient : Three hundred patient , acute elective referral radiology department Stockholm South General Hospital , Sweden , diagnostic abdominal US examination , include patient admit in-hospital care out-patients , prospectively enrol October 2011 November 2012 . Eligible patient identify radiology department study surgeon inform consent obtain . Six US educate surgeon participate enrolment patient . Exclusion criterion age &lt; 18 year inability communicate examiner . Referrals concern metastasis liver contrast-enhanced examination consider suitable study also exclude . The surgeon examine patient consecutively time available , mostly n't time examine every patient refer per day , hence certain prioritisation referral do . Data collection : Enrolled patient receive one US examination study surgeon well standard US examination on-duty radiologist . In majority case two examination perform consecutively time interval surgeon-performed US radiologist-performed US never exceed 24 hour . The surgeon 's examination take place either right radiologist 's examination . The examine surgeon radiologist blind 's finding . The surgeon 's US examination follow standardised protocol , include full abdominal scan , regardless nature referral . The presence gallstone mark 'yes ' ( positive finding , regardless number size ) 'no ' ( negative finding ) surgeon . In case full abdominal scan could perform , due urgent patient management , focus examination base referral well right upper quadrant ( RUQ ) scan advise . The on-duty radiologist perform standard care US focus individual referral . The radiologist 's statement collect patient 's medical record transfer study protocol separate radiologist , also blind surgeon 's examination . Among radiologist major part scan do US specialised radiologist several year train ( 56 % US specialist , 73 % specialist radiology ) . The surgeon use portable US machine model LOGIQ e convex ( 1.6-4.6 MHz ) linear ( 5-13 MHz ) transducer , GE Healthcare , WuXi , China . All scan save separate hard drive , keep together study protocol . The radiologist use Philips iU22 convex C5-1 linear L12-5 transducer . US train surgeon participate study : Six study surgeon , five final year specialist train one specialist surgery , limit previous US training , attend one-week course , comprise US physic , technique , anatomy hands-on training , lead specialist US . After attend course surgeon receive three week train radiology department guidance US specialist . The surgeon expect perform minimum 50 supervised scan , obtain case one . The training focus detect gallbladder stone , widen bile duct , thicken wall gallbladder , lesion liver parenchyma , hydronephrosis , abdominal aortic aneurysm , free abdominal fluid appendicitis . After train complete , surgeon spend minimum two week enrol scan patient office hour hospital 's radiology department . Ethics : The patient receive oral write information study surgeon include informed consent . The study approve Ethical Review Board , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden .</detailed_description>
