	<brief_summary>This research study do find tocilizumab , also know Actemra™ , help Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) . The investigator also want find tocilizumab safe take without cause many side effect . Currently ALS cure 1 modestly effective treatment slow progression disease . Although initial cause ALS , immune system play role death motor neuron . The immune cell participate process stimulate substance call interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) whose effect block tocilizumab thus , may slow death motor neuron slow disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Tocilizumab ALS Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled 16-week study evaluate safety tolerability tocilizumab subject sporadic ALS . The primary objective study determine safety tolerability intravenous administration 8 mg/kg tocilizumab every 4 week vs. match intravenous placebo administer every 4 week 8 week period . The secondary objective study describe expression pro-inflammatory gene Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMCs ) sporadic ALS patient , assess ability tocilizumab reduce expression pro-inflammatory gene PBMCs pro-inflammatory cytokine cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) patient sporadic ALS ass CSF penetration tocilizumab . Approximately 4 Northeast ALS Consortium ( NEALS ) Centers US participate study . Twenty-four subject randomize study . This study conduct subject meet El Escorial criterion possible , laboratory-supported probable , probable , definite criterion diagnosis ALS . At screening , eligible subject must least 18 year old , must slow vital capacity ( SVC ) ≥ 60 % predict capacity age , height gender , must provide write informed consent prior screen . Subjects stable dose riluzole take riluzole , woman child-bearing age screen eligible inclusion long meet specific protocol requirement . Detailed criterion describe body protocol . Subjects randomly assign 2:1 ratio intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg match placebo every 4 week 8 week period . This research study protocol allow subject receive 3 infusion Tocilizumab . Even treatment show benefit , additional infusion Tocilizumab beyond allow protocol give subject she/he participate study . Subjects remain randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind treatment Week 8 visit . Each randomized subject also Week 12 Follow-up visit Week 16 End-of-Study visit assess adverse event ( AEs ) , change concomitant medication , administer ALSFRS-R select study procedure .</detailed_description>
