	<brief_title>Phase III Efficacy Safety Study AB103 Treatment Patients With Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis study addition standard care treatment ( include surgical intervention , antimicrobial therapy critical care support organ dysfunction failure ) , AB103 demonstrate clinically significant treatment benefit placebo . This hypothesis address measure effect AB103 composite clinical parameter associate disease course patient NSTI , use responder analysis . A responding patient must meet 5 parameter composite clinical success end point , non-responding patient fail meet one parameter . These analysis design demonstrate addition safe , one dose 0.5 mg/kg AB103 : Improve systemic sign infection improve organ function patient compare placebo measure : - Survival Day 28 - Modified SOFA ( mSOFA ) score Day 14 change baseline Day 14 ≥ 3 . A Day 14 mSOFA score ≤1 change baseline ( pre-treatment ) Day 14 ≥3 require patient achieve primary composite clinical success endpoint ( NICCE ) Improve local sign infection , measure : - Reduced number debridement , count Day 14 . No 3 debridement Day 14 require patient achieve composite clinical success - No amputation first debridement ( amputation first debridement consider failure ) . A patient require amputation do first surgical procedure order achieve composite clinical success . 290 patient recruit study randomize receive either 0.5 mg/kg AB103 placebo 1:1 ratio . Randomization stratify within center diagnosis Fournier 's Gangrene mSOFA score category ( 3-4 v &gt; 4 ) screening . The study conduct interim analysis futility 100 patient safety monitor independent Data Monitoring Board regular plan interval .</detailed_description>
