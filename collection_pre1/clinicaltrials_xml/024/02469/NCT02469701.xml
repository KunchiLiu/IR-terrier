	<brief_summary>Nivolumab release inhibition immune system human cancer . Dramatic sustained activity observe advanced lung cancer . Ablation may stimulate immune system expose new tumor antigen . Since tumor express PD-L1 may likely respond nivolumab , ablation increase PD-L1 expression ( study ) treatment may enhance activity nivolumab treat site , non-treated , tumor . Ablation already FDA approve treatment cancer . Nivolumab recently FDA approve second line treatment advance squamous cell NSCLC . The goal study determine combination nivolumab ablation high systemic activity previously report nivolumab alone .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathologically cytologically confirm squamous cell NSCLC Stage IIIB stage IV . Patient meet either criterion A B : A ) Progression least 1 line systemic treatment ( IV oral ) metastatic locally advanced disease . Must provide documentation systemic treatment either locally advanced metastatic also scan assessment show progression . Radiation count 1 line . B ) Patients progress within 6 month completion neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy also eligible without treatment metastatic disease ( example patient stage I disease undergoes resection , receive systemic chemotherapy progress liver ( stage IV ) within 6 month chemotherapy ) . Radiation count 1 line . Ablation advance lung cancer consider treat physician treatment prevention symptom pain , bleed obstruction Documentation require write MD criterion . At least 1 site measurable disease treat ablation . Sites send confirmation lesion measurable disease ablate track response . At least 3 week since prior chemotherapy radiation therapy No brain metastasis except patient whose metastasis remove surgical resection stereotactic radiation gamma knife evidence active disease MRI within 28 day start treatment . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 02 . Life expectancy least 12 week . Required entry laboratory parameter within 14 day study entry : Granulocytes ≥ 1000/µl ; platelet count ≥75,000/µl ; absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 500/ µl ; Creatinine ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal mg/dl ; Bilirubin &lt; 1.5x upper limit normal ; AST ≤ 3 x upper limit normal . Age &gt; 18 year Men woman childbearing potential enrol study must agree use adequate barrier birth control measure course study 2 month . Written informed consent . Patients history clinically significant chronic autoimmune disease Prior therapy antibody modulate Tcell function define antiCTLA4 , antiPD1 , antiPDL1 Conditions currently require immunosuppressive medication Known history HIV hepatitis B C Bleeding diathesis coagulopathy investigator opinion would prevent ablation safely perform . Patients unstable angina ( anginal symptom rest ) newonset angina ( begin within last 3 month ) myocardial infarction within past 6 month . History organ allograft even take immunosuppressive medication Pregnant breastfeeding .</criteria>
