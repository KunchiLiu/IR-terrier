	<brief_summary>In general , toxicity radiation therapy chemotherapy exhibit strong dose-response relationship . However , patient receive similar dos still exhibit range toxicity response due variety factor , include comorbid condition , disease ( cancer ) specific factor , inter-individual genetic variation . A small percentage patient experience side effect either extremely severe extremely mild compare majority patient dose radiation chemotherapy give . Currently , reason entirely clear , likely relate patient specific factor immune response , cell/tissue repair capacity factor fundamentally rely rare genetic variation loci involved response . For example , patient homozygous deletion DNA damage response gene ATM uniquely sensitive DNA damaging agent . Many patient severe , homozygous mutation gene sequela lead medical recognition syndrome prior therapy . The investigator hypothesize patient unusually severe toxicity therapy exhibit classical sign homozygous mutation syndromes heterozygous nonfunctional hypofunctional allele loci , defect uncover relatively acute , severe stress pathway radiation chemotherapy . Conversely , patient mild reaction could exhibit rare variants/combinations variant make uniquely resistant chemotherapy radiotherapy toxicity . The purpose study well understand mechanism eventual goal develop predictive marker allow u help individually tailor cancer therapy future patient . Will accomplish goal study variety factor single vial blood . These include circulate protein hormone , circulate cell level sequence white blood cell DNA RNA use variety technique include limited determination cytokine/hormone level , proteomic analysis , immunocytochemical assay , whole exome sequence qPCR .</brief_summary>
