	<brief_summary>Respiratory muscle training ( RMT ) consider therapeutic strategy improve respiratory muscle strength mechanically ventilate ( MV ) patient facilitate ventilator wean . RMT aim improve strength endurance respiratory muscle . However , scarce research exist regard evaluation RMT MV patient additionally study differ method , RMT protocols subject include . There report Colombian study evaluate RMT effect MV patient . The aim study evaluate effectiveness respiratory muscle train increase respiratory muscle strength improve wean outcome MV patient require ventilatory support 48 hour Intensive Care Unit IV level Hospital Cali period 2014-2015</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients mechanical ventilation 48 hour invite participation study . Once participant identify his/her legal representative decide participate inform consent , subject randomly assign experimental conventional group . Data collection begin register individual information data collection form design study ; muscle strength measure Maximum Inspiratory Pressure ( MIP ) . Then , patient assign either experimental group control use opaque seal envelope . Stratified randomization perform , use SEPSIS status stratum , within category randomization block size 4 6 respectively . Once sepsis status establish , green envelope open patient sepsis , blue envelope open patient without sepsis . Finally intervention perform accord group assignment . Interventions Conventional Therapy Group Control group receive conventional intervention Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy establish institutional protocol , consist Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy every 6 hour , physical therapy mechanical ventilation management Measuring Respiratory Muscle Strength Respiratory muscle strength measure Maximum inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) follow American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) European Respiratory Society ( ERS ) . protocol . MIP measure perform group , experimental control . To measure MIP , ask patient maximum inspiration hold 5 second ; inspiration begin functional residual capacity ( FRC ) . We perform 3 measure patient register high value obtain , use Manuvacuometer measure . Experimental Group The experimental group receive conventional treatment plus respiratory muscle training protocol . Respiratory muscle training utilizes Threshold device ( IMT Respironics Inc ; Murrysville , USA ) , device validate healthy subject chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient Study Setting This study conduct Adult Intensive Care Unit Fundacion Valle del Lili , private health institution level IV , locate south Cali , referral centre southwest Colombia . Data Collection Instrument design pilot study We design data collection tool register data clinical record intervention , tool use group . The data collection tool include demographic , clinical intervention variable . We conduct pilot trial group patient similar characteristic study sample adjust aspect data collection tool measuring protocol . Research team field personnel train Four physical therapy specialist 4 year experience intensive care recruit monitor data collector . In order standardise determine validity MIP measuring protocol , principal researcher conduct training session physical therapist intra inter-rater validity 30 healthy subject establish . The primary source information data collection tool , file intervention subject . The secondary source information electronic medical record , record data reliable basis decision make critically ill patient . Patient recruit monitoring perform four physical therapist mention . Data collection occur Monday Sunday 8:00 a.m. 6:00 pm . Main researcher involve data collection intervention . The variable obtain patient admission study : type intervention , age , gender , medical history , diagnosis admission , Severity Index ( Apache II ) , hour mechanical ventilation , wean hour , cumulative dose sedative receive , cumulative dose analgesic receive , cumulative dose relaxant receive , cumulative dose steroid , socioeconomic status educational level . The variable obtained follow-up : respiratory muscle strength . The variable obtain end follow-up : Number session respiratory muscle training receive , mechanical ventilation time ( hour ) , total hour wean , cumulative dose sedative , cumulative dose pain medication receive , cumulative dose steroid , receive physical therapy , number physical therapy session , pulmonary rehabilitation receive , number pulmonary rehabilitation session , Non Invasive Ventilation requirement , pulmonary rehabilitation number session , death , reintubation requirement , reintubation date , number extubated hour reintubation , tracheotomy , tracheotomy date , septic shock , date septic shock , death , date death , decision continue study ( date ) . Data Quality A monthly checking data collection tool perform principal investigator , use checklist compare data record tool medical record subject , procedure do transcribe information study database . Additionally , every data collection tool review use checklist include three quality indicator : day follow-up completion closing tool , number empty box , number diagnosis inconsistent ; procedure also responsibility principal investigator . Monthly meeting study team hold talk record fault improve quality data collection registration . Database design management Once data data collection tool check , information register Epi Info database export STATA 12 analysis . Data register Epi Info database do every data collection tool close checked main researcher . Data registering perform person hire trained procedure . Database management analysis perform principal researcher . Data Analysis Plan Patient recruitment following-up described use flowchart design accord CONSORT statement 2010 . A preliminary exploratory data analysis conduct evaluate data performance basic assumption require implement statistical test ( normality , linearity homoscedasticity ) . This analysis also allow u identify error bias data collect , well outlier miss data . Sociodemographic clinical characteristic patient study entry analyse descriptively accord measurement level every variable use central tendency , dispersion measure , frequency table 95 % confidence interval . An analysis clinical sociodemographic characteristic eligible patient meet inclusion criterion include study also perform , well reason include ; analysis allow u identify selection bias . Finally univariate multivariate analysis perform accord study objective . Analysis perform intention treat basis patient . Respiratory Muscle Strength ( MIP ) : Presuming data normality , univariate analysis , difference final MIP mean experimental group control group analyse use t-student . Differences MIP mean within every group analyse use linear regression . If normality , error independency homoscedasticity meet , consider data transformation MIP variable . Once linear regression perform diagnostic test do evaluate model represent mimic observe data . In order control potential confuse factor adjustment variable do , consider confuse factor : ) Cumulative medicament dose receive intervention , ii ) Cumulative medicament dose receive , iii ) Time ventilation mode intervention , iv ) Time every ventilatory mode intervention , v ) Admission diagnosis . Additionally evaluate effect modification variable mention . Ventilation time wean time : perform univariate analysis total weaning time total ventilation time experimental control group use survival analysis ( Kaplan-Meyer ) . We also intend multivariate analysis total weaning time total ventilation time use Cox regression adjust potential confusing factor consider variable . We verify Cox model assumption hazard proportionality following-up . Need reintubation : We univariate analysis need reintubation use comparison proportion Chi-square Fischer exact test . Need reintubation Relative Risk ( RR ) also determine patient group ( Control Experimental ) . We multivariate analysis need reintubation logistic regression adjust potential confusing factor mention .</detailed_description>
