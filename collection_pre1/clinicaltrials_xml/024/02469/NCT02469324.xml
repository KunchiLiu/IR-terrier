	<brief_title>A Comparative RCT Brief Internet-based Compassionate Mind Training Cognitive-behavioral Therapy Mothers Their Babies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study provide support clinical utility Internet-based Compassionate-Mind Training ( CMT ) pregnant woman , woman recently pregnant , woman interest become pregnant . Specifically , investigator compare exist treatment , Internet-based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) psychoeducational resource Internet-based CMT psychoeducational resource . The researcher hypothesize Internet-based CMT effective Internet-based CBT enhance self-compassion self-reassuring decrease self-criticizing self-attacking . Additionally , researcher hypothesize CBT CMT condition near equivalence improve participant affect well depression anxiety . An additional aim study assess feasibility acceptability course . As , participant condition invite complete feedback question course . The feedback question use hope adapt improve course base participant feedback . Up 7.1 % new mother United States may experience depression within first three month give birth ( Gavin et al. , 2005 ) . If minor depressive episode include , prevalence rate become high 19.2 % ( Gavin et al. , 2005 ) . The global incidence postnatal depression likely even high ( Almond , 2009 ) . This course target woman interested become pregnant , currently pregnant , pregnant last year seek improve well-being perinatal period . There strong base research suggest maternal depression significant impact offspring ( Forman et al. , 2007 ; Goodman , 2007 ) . These effect tend develop child still in-utero ( Forman et al. , 2007 ; Goodman , 2007 ) continue offspring reach adulthood ( Goodman &amp; Brand , 2008 ) . Research Martins Gaffan ( 2000 ) suggest insecure attachment pattern common child depress mother child non-depressed mother . Furthermore , insecure attachment style substantial implication persistent issue function childhood throughout entire lifespan ( Martins &amp; Gaffan , 2000 ) . Since attachment perhaps vital relationship human life , crucial help make relationship positive one . Of PPD intervention analyze meta-analysis Clatworthy ( 2012 ) , brief intervention show positively impact PPD ( Matthey , Kavanagh , Howie , Barnett , &amp; Charles , 2004 ) , whereas long intervention analyze show effect ( Buist , Westley , &amp; Hill , 1999 ) . There evidence suggest intervention base psychological model effective purely educational material ( Clatworthy , 2012 ) . Internet intervention , include present course , advantage low cost reach large audience around world . Nonconsumable intervention , reusable intervention , predominately automate reuse minimal cost additional individual participant ( Muñoz , 2010 ) . Nonconsumable intervention important reduce health disparity worldwide , reuse low cost . The current Internet Intervention , aim increase compassion , non-consumable firmly ground principle Dr. Paul Gilbert 's CFT . Additionally , CFT condition compare CBT Internet intervention assess relative efficacy . The researcher focus specifically construct self-compassion , self-reassurance , self-attacking , depression , anxiety , mood . Self-compassion involve individual aware open internal suffer one experience ( Neff , Hsieh , &amp; Dejitterat , 2005 ) , keep mind imperfect trait share across human ( Neff &amp; Vonk , 2009 ; Neff , 2009 ) . Samaie Farahani ( 2011 ) find self-compassion serve significant moderator rumination stress , suggest high level self-compassion decrease relationship rumination stress ( Samaie &amp; Farahani , 2011 ) . Also , self-compassion also link one 's ability balance one 's needs need another conflict situation ( Yarnell &amp; Neff , 2013 ) . The cultivation self-compassion show improve quality share decision make interpersonal relationship well improve individual 's ability balance need relationship need partner ( Yarnell &amp; Neff , 2013 ) . CFT , aim increase compassion , movement towards biopsychosocial science psychotherapy ( Gilbert , 2010 ; Lawrence &amp; Lee , 2013 ) . It seek increase systemic harmony ability cultivate compassion others , receive compassion others , direct compassion towards self . This approach draw social , developmental , evolutionary Buddhist psychology ( Gilbert , 2009 ) . CFT hold psychopathology manifest unbalance system affect regulation , threat-based system activate disproportionately contentment , safety , soothe system . As , approach seek educate participant system increase contentment , safety , soothe system activity order augment compassion well-being ( Lawrence &amp; Lee , 2013 ) . Compassionate Mind Training ( CMT ) intervention component principle CFT ( Gilbert &amp; Procter , 2006 ) . A lack stimulation contentment , soothe , safety system may also physiological effect , particularly inhibit production oxytocin ( Cree , 2010 ) . When maternal oxytocin disregulated , parent-child bonding process adversely affect ( Carter , 1998 ) . Furthermore , irregularity neuroendocrine activity relate attachment , history parent , social atmosphere make bond process difficult ( Carter , 2003 ) . The use CFT perinatal population ability stimulate aforementioned system , improve mother 's compassion , positively impact attachment baby . In preliminary study , researcher contact participant UCSF Mothers Babies Internet Project ( Barrera , Kelman , &amp; Muñoz , 2014 ) . The majority respondent state would interested learn compassionate ( 83 % English participant ; 94 % Spanish participant ) . Also , woman assert Internet-based CMT would useful ( mean rating=7.41 10 ) . The hypothesis current study : 1 . Following completion didactic portion course , participant see great increase self-reassurance decrease self-attacking self-criticizing CMT condition relative CBT condition . 2 . Following completion didactic portion course , participant see near equivalent affect improvement CMT CBT condition . 3 . Following completion entire course , participant see great increase self-compassion CMT condition relative CBT condition . 4 . Following completion entire course , participant see near equivalent reduction depression anxiety CMT CBT condition .</detailed_description>
