	<brief_summary>It well know chest surgery patient suffer high level pain perioperative period . The transition thoracoscopic approach reduce surgical pain . The proper pain control technique thoracoscopic approach still debate . One popular method pain control procedure Intercostal block . The Intercostal block usually base upon topical analgesic . In study investigator try examine effect pain control time Intercostal block 100 mg BUPIVACAINE . The study prospective comparative study . The cohort divide two group . In control group patient Intercostal block surgery study group intercostal block give begin surgical procedure . All analgesic treatment post-surgery group . The study evaluate pain level day surgery , analgesic medication consumption relevant morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Intercostal Block Scheduling Preventing Acute Surgical Post-surgical Pain Thoracoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intercostal Bupivacaine block Intercostal block procedure local anesthetic inject intercostal space . This space include rote intercostal nerve . The purpose procedure block neuropathic pain develop due inflammation irritation nerve close structure . Some add steroid injection anti-inflammatory effect . Bupivacaine local anesthetic . It belong group medicine call amide- type local anesthetic . It well-known medication many year document use local regional anesthesia . Bupivacaine bind intracellular portion voltage-gated sodium channel block sodium influx nerve cell . This block prevent depolarization . The lack depolarization preclude initiation conduction pain signal occur . Study Aims This study try evaluate difference pain control post thoracoscopic surgery patient bupivacaine intercostal block versus surgery . The study main end point amount analgesic medication consumption patient thoracoscopic surgery . Secondary end point include subjective patient 's pain evaluation , length hospital stay post-operative complication . Inclusion Criteria Thoracoscopic surgery candidate . Over 18 year old . No known allergy Bupivacaine . Patient able read understand singe inform consent . Exclusion Criteria Previous thoracic operation side . Study plan The study cohort divide two group . Study group control group . Each group include 30 thoracoscopic surgery candidate . The participant randomly assign research group use computer selection do study team . The participant know group assign . All participant recruit cardio-thoracic surgery department , CARMEL medical center , Haifa , ISRAEL . The basic thoracoscopic surgery approach use three operation cut main Lateral surgical cut le 5 cm . Another low cut 1-2cmfor video camera lateral subscapular cut 1-2cm lung retraction . No rib retractor use . During surgery anesthesiology team charge patient sedation analgesia accord local anesthesia department protocol . After surgery thoracic team charge patient analgesia treatment accord cardio-thoracic surgery department local protocol . Patients randomize either study control group . In study group surgeon perform intercostal Bupivacaine block 100ml five intercostal space include operation cut . The block do begin surgery right insertion video camera pleural space . In control group surgeon perform intercostal block end surgery closing operation cut . All operation stapes analgesic treatment group . Follow Patient follow include perioperative hospitalization continue six month discharge . Follow include analgesic medication usage , pain level , demographic detail , Hospital length stay , post-operative complication time resume daily routine .</detailed_description>
