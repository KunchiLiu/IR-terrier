	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation evaluate safety , tolerability , preliminary long-term effectiveness utilize ReCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device ( ReCell ) combine widen split-thickness skin graft ( STSG ) mesh onto dermal regenerate INTEGRA™ Meshed Bilayer Wound Matrix ( MBWM ) heal full-thickness wound .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study describe herein determine safety , tolerability , preliminary long-term effectiveness use Recell device widen STSG mesh . It hypothesize ReCell cell suspension , combination INTEGRA™ MBWM , improve upon current standard care . The potential ReCell 's promotion healing interstice STSG mesh may close gap potential point failure subsequent rehabilitation return physical activity . Within current study , participant serve his/her control , allow comparison ReCell treat ( experimental ) non-ReCell treat ( control ) region graft wound . In proposed study , patient serve his/her control . Due nature study , patient whose wound previously successfully treat INTEGRA™ MBWM part standard care qualify participation . Therefore , part enrollment eligibility criterion study , identify study wound first treat INTEGRA™ MBWM . The wound allow heal approximately two four week , time viable granulation layer develop thus allow next stage STSG grafting . The timing STSG application determine clinician judgment base state granulation process , vary patient , typically take 2 4 week . Approximately two four week INTEGRA™ MBWM treatment , study wound divide ReCell-treated area ( 1:5 mesh STSG ) control area treat 1:1.5 mesh STSG ( ReCell ) . In case , ReCell region may 320cm2 size ; upper limit application area one ReCell kit , similarly size control region . If wound large combine ReCell control region ( 640cm2 ) , area outside study region designate non-study area treat accord standard care . The primary secondary dressing use ReCell-treated area , control area donor site . Once study control wound determine heal , standard local clinical practice follow . Within-subject comparison ReCell region control region , order evaluate improvement associate use ReCell , battery measurement evaluation make . These measurement divide three category : safety tolerability , preliminary effectiveness ( acute heal process ) long-term effectiveness . The safety research participant foremost . Therefore , effort make control risk participant throughout duration study participation . Wound heal time , donor site morbidity histology assess acute 6 week phase , follow-up visit Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 6 post-treatment . Subjects continue study long-term follow-up clinic visit Week 12 24 post-treatment . Healing treat wound site ( A region B region ) donor site ( STSG 1:5 , STSG 1:1.5 ReCell ) assess visit . Treated wound consider heal 95 % great study area re-epithelialized Week 6 post-treatment . Donor sit consider healed ≥95 % donor site re-epithelialized Week 4 post-treatment . Aesthetic functional outcome treat area assess document . Subject satisfaction also assess document two time point .</detailed_description>
