	<detailed_description>Breast milk consider gold standard early childhood nutrition , optimize term ingredient need infant first month life . Formula differ many way composition breast milk , e.g . structure concentration protein contain . To ensure adequate supply infant essential semi-essential amino acid conventional infant formula contain significantly high total protein concentration breast milk . Therefore formula-fed infant significantly high total protein intake first month compare exclusively breast-fed infant , individual amino acid therefore feed excess . The increased intake protein , thus increase intake insulinogenic amino acid infancy ( e.g . branch chain amino acid leucine , isoleucine valine ) , consider possible co-factor late disposition overweight obesity . Breastfeeding induces slow growth infant proven associate low risk overweight obese time school entry ( von Kries 1999 ) . The high protein intake bottle-fed baby seem contribute significantly difference observe growth behavior breast-fed bottle-fed child first year life . Obvious approach optimize infant formula therefore reduction protein content , ensure adequate supply relevant amino acid similar breast milk . Enrichment alpha-lactalbumin enables reduction total protein content formula qualitative upgrading protein body high content essential amino acid , thereby limit surplus protein intake , time supply adequate amount essential amino acid . The aim examine nutritive efficacy safety modify infant formula reduce protein content improve protein quality . Primary outcome measure weight gain growth young infant 12 week dietary intake new infant formula , metabolic effect qualitative quantitative change protein content new formula . Two group healthy bottle-fed infant compare . The treatment group feed 3 month infant formula decrease protein content . At time body experimental protein infant formula modify enrichment bovine alpha-lactalbumin . A control group receive isocaloric conventional infant formula protein body consist whey protein casein ratio 60:40 , without specific accumulation alpha-lactalbumin time period . A group breastmilk feed infant serve reference group . In regular anthropometric control growth thrive study participant document compare different group . In addition , laboratory test carry , examine influence diet insulin response , protein metabolism specific growth factor . In follow-up long-term effect nutrition body composition record compare body fat measurement ( skinfold thickness-Calipometrie ) first year life .</detailed_description>
