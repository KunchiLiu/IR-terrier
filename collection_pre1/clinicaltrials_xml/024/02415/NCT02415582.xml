	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect two exercise protocol post-exercise blood pressure versus control group elderly hypertensive men . Participants allocate group : control group two experimental exercise protocol , random order . In control group , participant remain rest sitting , , exercise protocol , participant practice exercise bouts aerobic exercise combination resistance aerobic exercise . In order standardize baseline condition , session subject remain sit quietly 20 minute . After exercise protocol , participant 60 minute recovery , simultaneously , BP measure every 5 minute . After exercise session control , equipment 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring instal every participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertension high prevalence low rate control , major modifiable risk factor public health problem . Regular physical exercise relevant non-pharmacological option prevention treatment hypertension . Several study demonstrate reduction blood pressure ( BP ) follow different exercise protocol , decrease may result summation hypotensive effect occur hour follow workout . The reduction result single exercise session call post-exercise hypotension ( PEH ) investigate among hypertensive subject . However , achieve clinical relevance PEH reach significant magnitude reduction sustain long period . Previous study show positive effect aerobic exercise post-exercise hypotension hypertensive subject . However , lack evidence regard effect single session aerobic resistance exercise combine , duration effect 24 hour blood pressure elderly hypertensive subject . The study open , crossover randomize clinical trial , elderly men allocate three arm , random order : - Aerobic training session - Combined resistance training aerobic session - Control session After exercise session , participant 60 minute recovery , perform sit position , BP measurements every 5 minute . In addition , participant measure BP use 24h ambulatory BP monitoring . At end trial , participant complete three experimental protocol : non-exercise control session , sit rest , two exercise bout , one aerobic exercise combine resistance aerobic exercise , seven day washout period among session . All experiment conduct time day account diurnal BP variation . Before experimental session , participant enrol three pre-intervention test : familiarization session , cardiopulmonary exercise test one maximum repetition strength test ( 1RM ) . The aerobic session last 45 minute , well resistance exercise , session control .</detailed_description>
