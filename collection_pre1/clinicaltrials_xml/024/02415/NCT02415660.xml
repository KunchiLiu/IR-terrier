	<brief_title>Short-Term Response Thoracic Spine Manipulation With Without Trigger Point Dry Needling Mechanical Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neck pain common , return duty rate medical evacuation theater spinal pain low . Muscles comprise majority stability cervical spine , yet neck muscle function alter presence pain . Research consistently show benefit include thoracic spine manipulation ( SMT ) treatment patient mechanical neck pain . Emerging evidence also show promising benefit include trigger point dry needling ( TDN ) treatment mechanical neck pain . Treatment regimens commonly address anterior cervical stabilizing musculature , little known regard response treatment deep posterior stabilize musculature . This study ass short term response thoracic SMT without TDN 58 subject primary complaint mechanical neck pain . Subjects randomize receive 2 treatment visit approximately 2-3 day apart either SMT+sham TDN SMT+TDN . TDN direct upper trapezius deep cervical extensor muscle neck . Outcomes interest change function pain . Assessments make baseline , immediately first treatment , 2nd treatment , approximately 5-7 day 2nd treatment visit . A subgroup 20 subject ( 10 per group ) also upper trapezius deep cervical extensor muscle activation assess via shear wave elastography , deep cervical flexor activation assess via craniocervical flexion test .</detailed_description>
