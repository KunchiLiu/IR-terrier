	<brief_summary>This randomise , observer-blinded trial compare selective shoulder block interscalene block . Both block place use ultra-sound guided technique . Primary outcome measure postoperative pain score use rescue opioids . Secondary outcome measure pre- postoperative occurence motor deficit arm dyspnea , quality sleep first night surgery measure numeric rating scale overall satisfaction pain therapy measure International Pain Outcomes questionnaire NRS-score ( 0 = satisfy 10 = satisfy ) . Primary secondary outcome measure assess first 24hours surgery ( assessment postanesthetic care unit ( PACU ) directly admission discharge surgical ward 4 , 8 24 hour surgery ) . Overall satisfaction pain therapy assess 48hours surgery . An interscalene block block plexus brachialis interscelene triangle ( inject local anesthetic around nerve plexus ) . A selective shoulder block block suprascapular axillary nerve ( inject local anesthetic around nerve ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomise , observer-blinded trial compare selective shoulder block interscalene block . The goal study compare ultrasound-guided selective shoulder block ( regional anesthesia suprascapular axillary nerve ) ultrasound-guided interscalene block arthroscopic shoulder surgery . More specific , study design compare postoperative pain score , use opioids , pre- postoperative occurence motor deficit arm dyspnea , quality sleep first night surgery measure numeric rating scale overall satisfaction measure International Pain Outcomes questionnaire NRS-score ( 0 = satisfy 10 = satisfy ) . Primary secondary outcome measure assess first 24hours surgery ( assessment postanesthetic care unit ( PACU ) directly admission discharge surgical ward 4 , 8 24 hour surgery ) . Overall satisfaction pain therapy assess 48hours surgery . Continuous interscalene brachial plexus block consider standard treatment postoperative pain shoulder surgery . With interscalene block local anesthetic inject around nerve plexus supply motor sensory innervation upper limb . Disadvantages extensive motor sensory block upper limb paresis diaphragm sometimes provoke dyspnea . Since 2007 new technique describe , example selective block suprascapular nerve axillary nerve . These two nerve supply shoulder joint motor sensory innervation , function distal part upper limb . The risk loss innervation diaphragm avoid selective shoulder block . Hence , possible breathing disorder avoid . Previous study conclude selective shoulder block safe technique effective reduce postoperative pain arthroscopic shoulder surgery . Moreover , study also suggest selective shoulder block long duration , less fluctutations pain score less rebound pain fading regional anesthesia . With study investigator want compare effect newer technique single shot interscalene plexus block . Therefore investigator allocate patient two group comparison . One group receive interscalene plexus block group receive selective shoulder block . The used local anesthetic group , ropivacaine 0,75 % total volume 20 ml . Both block place use ultra-sound guided technique . In previous study blind technique , base anatomical reference point nerve stimulation , use place selective shoulder block . As block place ultrasound-guided technique , anesthesiologist direct view location needle . With technique less risk accidental intravascular injection nerve injury . Also great probability success faster implementation block . Indepent technique use , pain patient may experience reduce minimum . Therefore patient wlll supply PCIA system ( patient control intravenous analgesia ) , next standard pain reliever ( paracetamol , anti-inflammatory medication ) . This PCIA system pump system piritramide ( Dipidolor® , opioid ) connect infusion line . The system set way , within certain limit , patient decide him/herself pain treatment provide . This monocentric , prospective , randomise observer-blinded study . Patients include randomised two group . One group receive ultrasound-guided single shot interscalene block , group receive ultrasound-guided selective shoulder block ( axillary nerve suprascapular nerve ) . The patient strictly blind two injection need selective shoulder block , compare one injection interscalene block . The data collector ( per- postoperative ) blind , inform block perform . This order avoid bias .</detailed_description>
