	<brief_title>Continuous Adductor Canal Block ( CACB ) v . Combined Spinal Epidural ( CSE ) Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : Compare continuous adductor canal block ( CACB ) Combined Spinal Epidural ( CSE ) total knee arthroplasty term mobility , post-operative pain , analgesic use . Hypothesis : CACB provide good mobility CSE post operatively . Background/Scientific Review : Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) associate vary degree pain post operatively range mild severe despite use comprehensive multimodal analgesic regimens1 . Optimizing pain relief vital functional recovery total knee arthroplasty2 . Peripheral nerve block commonly use improve pain relief reduce opioid requirement . The addition nerve block involve femoral nerve show provide superior pain control3 shorten hospital stay compare epidural intravenous patient control analgesia alone1 . However , femoral nerve block result quadriceps weakness lead functional impairment increase risk fall post operatively4 . Unlike Femoral Nerve Blocks ( FNB ) , adductor canal block ( ACB ) predominantly sensory block preserve quadriceps muscle strength ambulation ability well FNBs , provide equivalent pain relief5-9 . Recent randomized study also show ACB superior placebo set spinal general intraoperative anesthesia term ambulation , pain control , opioid consumption10-12 . In recent retrospective cohort study , addition ACB local infiltration analgesia ( LIA ) associate improvement early ambulation benchmarks high rate home discharge compare LIA9 . While CACB CSE use part routine care Rush University Medical Center around country , study directly compare CACB CSE . Study Design : Department fund , single center , prospective , randomize , parallel outcome base clinical trial . 300 subject schedule undergo primary unilateral TKA randomize receive CSE , CACB + General , CACB + Spinal per routine care . Subjects enrol 6 week . Power Analysis : Sample size calculation base primary aim , CACB plus Spinal anesthesia versus standard care ( combine spinal epidural , CSE ) improve ambulation distance postoperative day 1 ( POD1 ) . Based result pilot study find CSE group POD1 mean distance travel 159 foot standard deviation ( SD ) 111 foot , CACB + Spinal anesthesia subject walk twice distance average similar SD . To conservative expect CACB + Spinal anesthesia CACB + General Anesthesia group walk least 35 % farther average , least equal CSE group . Based one-way , 3-level AVOVA primary contrast CABC + Spinal versus CSE 35 % great ambulation difference , 90 % power , Î± 5 % , require sample size 84 subject per group . Increasing sample size 100 provide 16 % dropout rate . Total 300 patient . Treatment Groups : 1 . General Intraoperative Anesthesia standard post-operative Continuous Adductor Canal Block ( 0.2 % ropivacaine run 6-8mL/hr ) standard post-operative analgesic . 2 . Spinal Intraoperative Anesthesia standard post-operative Continuous Adductor Canal Block ( 0.2 % ropivacaine run 6-8mL/hr ) standard post-operative analgesic . 3 . Spinal Intraoperative Anesthesia standard Epidural ( 0.1 % bupivacaine fentanyl 5 mcg/mL run 6mL/hr 1mL q15 bolus ) standard post-operative analgesic . Demographics/Patient Specifics : Age , Sex , ASA score , Weight , Height , Operative Time , BMI , Walker , Cane , Unassisted Ambulation Risks/Benefits : Combined spinal epidural anesthesia , general anesthesia , continuous adductor canal block part routine anesthesia care Rush University Medical Center around country . Post-operative analgesia regiment standard care . Risks general anesthesia include sore throat , nausea/vomiting , potential tooth damage , vocal cord injury , mental confusion , awareness , stroke , death . Risks regional anesthesia ( spinal ) include bleed ( spinal hematoma ) , infection ( meningitis ) , nerve damage , headache , hypotension , difficulty urinating , seizure . There difference epidural catheter adductor canal catheter term risk , adductor canal catheter carry risk headache . These risk present regardless study since either general spinal anesthesia use total knee arthroplasty procedure . The risk involve participate study potential breach confidentiality and/or privacy .
