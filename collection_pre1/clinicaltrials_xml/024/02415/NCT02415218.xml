	<brief_title>Transplantation Autologous Oral Mucosal Epithelial Sheets Limbal Stem-cell Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy safety cultivate oral mucosal epithelial sheet transplantation novel therapy limbal stem-cell deficiency , effective approach thus far available , evaluate purpose establish therapy effective strategy disease aim improve visual acuity corneal transparency . The primary endpoint area conjunctivalization corneal epithelial defect one year , evaluate accord 6-grade rating scale . The secondary endpoint correct visual acuity , severity corneal opacification , extent corneal neovascularization , expect ocular complication , adverse event include abnormal laboratory finding . The purpose research evaluate efficacy investigational therapy provide rationale make strategy approve advanced medical care future .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Among patient bilateral limbal stemcell deficiency , meet criterion list give inform consent participate research include . 1 . Patients eye ( ) ( subject interventional therapy ) show ( ) loss dysfunction corneal epithelial stem cell throughout total* circumference cornea 2 . Patients corneal surface eye ( ) ( subject investigational therapy ) ( ) entirely envelop conjunctival tissue 3 . Patients gender age â‰¥20 year give inform consent 4 . Patients give write consent participate clinical research ( The target disease bilateral limbal stemcell deficiency , although always necessary eye patient meet inclusion criterion . ) 1 . Patients may pregnant , patient breast feed 2 . Patients infection ( HBV , HCV , HIV , HTLV1 ) 3 . Patients extreme hypolacrimation resistant therapy 4 . Patients oral mucosal specimen collect clear scar formation inflammatory finding note cellcollection site mucosal membrane 5 . Patients whose score Performance Status ( PS* ) 3 6 . Any others judge chief subinvestigator ineligible clinical research , due presence complication , etc .</criteria>
