	<brief_summary>For elective abdominal surgery preoperative administration 8 mg dexamethasone reduce incident postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) . Whether preoperative administration 8 mg dexamethasone reduces PONV patient acute abdominal surgery establish . The investigator wish see preoperative administration 8 mg dexamethasone minimum 30 minute prior diagnostic laparoscopy suspect appendicitis reduce incident PONV 50 % . Of secondary interest investigator want see 8 mg dexamethasone preoperative reduce pain , reduce opioid consumption , postoperative fatigue , duration time resumption work resumption normal daily activity , enhance quality recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Preoperative Patients Undergoing Laparoscopy Suspected Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy suspect appendicitis randomize receive placebo 8 mg dexamethasone intravenously minimum 30 minute prior operation . Randomization do envelope randomization . We would expect 60 % patient would experience postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) first 24-32 hour postoperatively . To show 50 % reduction incident PONV first 24-32 hour postoperatively ( power 80 % , significant level 5 % loss follow 20 % ) need 60 patient arm . So total 120 patient randomize 1:1 . Both site use paper Case Report Forms ( CRF ) . The trial monitor regional GCP ( Good Clinical Practice ) unit adhere GCP guideline . Patients assess self report questionnaire preoperatively postoperatively 2-10 hour , 8-16 hour , 24-32 hour , postoperative day ( POD ) 2 , POD 3 , POD 7 , POD 14 POD 30 . Preoperative anxiety record VAS scale , Pain Catastrophizing Scale Hospital anxiety depression scale record preoperative questionnaire . A short telephone interview do first postoperative day regard duration abdominal pain prior admission , social status regard child whether live another adult , smoke status , use sleep medication use psychopharmacy minimum 7 day prior operation , physical level normal daily activity , physical level work , educational occupational background . Other demographic height , weight , ASA class , age , last CRP prior operation , duration operation , date time admission , date time discharge register electronic patient record file . Pathology remove tissue register trough pathology report . Diagnosis operation , preformed procedure , whether preform surgeon supervise , number identical procedure preform previous surgeon surgeon supervisor ( supervise ) record patient CRF preform surgeon . Pre- , intra- post-operative pain medication , antiemetic antibiotic record electronic patient medication file . Postoperative complication adverse event record electronic patient record file telephone interview . To ensure high completion rate , patient contact telephone registration time postoperatively . Parametric non-parametric statistical analysis use appropriate .</detailed_description>
