	<brief_summary>Study Design : This multicentre , prospective , open-label , single arm , phase IV registry study . No additional procedure include study . Standard clinical data collect . This include physical examination NIHSS score assessment baseline . In addition , neuro-imaging collect . Standard image include non-contrast CT brain baseline 7±2 day post-treatment . Repeat NIHSS score assessment time 7 day CT scan . Repeat clinical NIHSS score assessment 30 day post-enrolment also collect performed part standard care . Study Objectives : 1 . Demonstrate safety early dabigatran initiation minor stroke/TIA patient atrial fibrillation . 2 . Determine frequency asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation 7 day dabigatran treatment follow stroke/TIA 3 . Determine effect asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation functional neurological outcome 30 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Aim Design : The primary aim CPASS registry demonstrate safety early anticoagulation dabigatran follow cardioembolic stroke . CPASS prospective open label single arm observational study . Safety establish demonstrate low rate hemorrhage set . Administrative Structure : CPASS Canadian Stroke Consortium lead study . The study coordinate centre University Alberta . Case report form data monitoring complete electronically , use online EDC system . All image data read centrally Stroke Imaging Laboratory University Alberta . Study Design Considerations : A randomized control design consider ( dabigatran versus warfarin ) . This consider impractical number reason . Novel oral anticoagulant recommend first line agent stroke prevention AF patient Canadian Cardiovascular Society.19 These agent associate improved safety respect bleed complication . This make randomization patient warfarin would otherwise prescribed dabigatran somewhat ethically dubious . In addition , randomize design would necessitate large study , would complete reasonable period time . A registry design allow u address question safety systematic fashion . A safety threshold define anticoagulant use early stroke , base rate warfarin-associated intracranial hemorrhage , report 0.5 2.5 per 100 patient years.20-24 The registry design therefore permit determination whether dabigatran within threshold . Finally , systematic collection clinical imaging data allow u determine risk factor hemorrhagic transformation associate early anticoagulation . Prescribed Study Treatments : Patients dabigatran initiate within 14 day TIA/stroke symptom onset include registry . Patients treat either dose 110 mg BID 150 mg BID . The dose timing initiation therapy within 14 day window determine treat physician . The factor related physician choice initiation time ( relative symptom onset ) record . Visit Schedule / Clinical Data Collection : Standard clinical assessment data collect . This include baseline National Institutes Health Stroke Scale NIHSS , Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) vital sign , record case report form . Stroke risk factor , past medical history medication , baseline complete blood count , coagulation profile renal function test also record . CHADS2 CHADSVaSC score also record . Clinical endpoint ischemic stroke intracranial hemorrhage within 30 day anticoagulant initiation . All cerebral ischemic intracranial hemorrhagic endpoint centrally adjudicate anonymized clinical record , intracranial hemorrhage classify describe . A data collection form fill subject 30 day post-enrolment indicate clinical status occurrence outcome event .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All patient ≥ 18 year age . 2 . Minor ischemic stroke , define NIHSS score ≤ 3 . Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) , define acute focal neurological deficit , complete resolution symptom within 24 h onset . In case onset time establish , consider time patient last know well . 3 . Atrial Fibrillation ( AF , paroxysmal persistent ) . AF must confirm ECG/Holter monitor , history All patient prescribe dabigatran accord Canadian product label treat physician follow stroke/TIA . The decision treat dabigatran time first dose determine attend physician , independent registry . All patient CT scan MRI , finding consistent ischemic etiology symptom . 4 . Ability obtain informed consent obtain patient legally authorize representative . 1 . Acute chronic renal failure , define eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min ( Cockcroft Gault formula ) . 2 . Known hypersensitivity dabigatran contraindication dabigatran therapy , per Canadian label information . 3 . Prior treatment dabigatran novel oral anticoagulant ( include Factor Xa antagonist ) . Treatment warfarin prior stroke/TIA acceptable , enrolment begin INR ≤1.5 . 4 . Prior symptomatic ischemic stroke ( TIA exclusion criterion ) 5 . Any significant ongoing systemic bleeding risk , i.e . active GI/GU bleeding recent major surgery . 6 . Clinically significant recent past history clinical presentation ICH , subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH ) , arteriovenous ( AV ) malformation , aneurysm , cerebral neoplasm . At discretion Investigator . 7 . Hereditary acquire hemorrhagic diathesis . 8 . Anticipated inability comply follow . 9 . Any condition , judgment investigator could impose hazard patient study therapy initiate affect participation patient study .</criteria>
