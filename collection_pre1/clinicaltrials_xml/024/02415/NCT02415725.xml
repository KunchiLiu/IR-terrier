	<detailed_description>Many clinical situation oncologic surgery imply need dissect less extensively lymph node station direct relation lymphatic drainage anatomical region affect cancer . The dissected lymph node drain generally several region , dissection reduces drainage capacity region , increase risk patient develop secondary lymphedema , short long surgery . The recent meta-analysis show nearly 15 % patient operate cancer lymph node dissection develop 27 month surgery lymphedema limb correspond operated region . Radio- chemotherapy may especially encumber already reduce lymphatic capacity . The impact health quality life patient significant physical psychological aspect , also social economic aspect . Efficient treatment exist , difficult implement continue long time . They consider serious disease expensive INAMI . Lymphedema chronic disease need repeat continued treatment . The late treatment lymphedema begin , heavy , medical socio-economic level . Some patient even lose job functional infirmity . Here investigator remind lymphedema painless , even spectacular case . Still currently , lymphedema diagnose develop , functional discomfort , physical appearance disturb patient enough go consultation . The lymphofluoroscopy ( new emerge imaging technique field lymphology ) use since 3 year promoter present project , show oncologic patient , operate free apparent secondary lymphedema , present abnormality lymphatic network . These patient report heaviness sensation sporadic paraesthesia generally arouse suspicion begin lymphedema . The present prospective , multidisciplinary multicentric clinical study aim confirm possible detect secondary lymphedema subclinical stage . In second step , prevention consider . Detection may perform use simple lymphofluoroscopic examination , minimally invasive inexpensive imaging technique . It allow realize map superficial lymphatic network identify characteristic secondary lymphedema group patient risk develop lymphedema lymph node dissection .</detailed_description>
