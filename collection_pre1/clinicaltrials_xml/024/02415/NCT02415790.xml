	<brief_summary>This first-in-human study , design ass safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) single oral ascending dos E2027 , administer healthy adult participant determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Thereafter , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect single dos E2027 elevation cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) cyclic guanidine monophosphate ( cGMP ) healthy adult participant evaluate across broad dose range , establish PK/PD relationship .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist 4 part , Parts A , B , C , D. Part A single ascend dose ( SAD ) clinical pharmacology evaluation safety , tolerability , PK characteristic MTD healthy adult ( great equal 18 year less equal 50 year old ) . In Part B , PK PD effect E2027 CSF cGMP evaluate healthy adult ( great equal 18 year less equal 50 year old ) . Participants 2nd cohort Part B participate evaluation food effect Treatment Period 2 . In Part C , design similar Part A . This healthy elderly cohort ( great equal 65 year less equal 85 year old ) provide bridge PK , safety , tolerability data E2027 compare young healthy participant Part A Part B . Part D conduct healthy Japanese adult participant ( great equal 20 year less equal 50 year old ) design bridge PK , safety , tolerability data E2027 Japanese non-Japanese participant . All part study 2 phase : Prerandomization Phase Randomization Phase . The Prerandomization Phase consist Screening Period Baseline Period participant 's study eligibility determine baseline assessment conduct . The Randomization Phase consist Treatment Period Follow-Up Period . During Treatment Period , participant randomize receive single oral dose either E2027 placebo match E2027 .</detailed_description>
