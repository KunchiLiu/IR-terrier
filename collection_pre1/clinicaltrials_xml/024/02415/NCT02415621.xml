	<brief_title>Adaptive Abiraterone Therapy Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pilot study , 20 black participant 20 non-black participant enrol achieve 50 % decline prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) abiraterone asymptomatic minimally symptomatic metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) . Abiraterone stop re-initiated 50 % increase PSA . Each time abiraterone stop , define start new adaptive therapy cycle . Participants achieve 50 % decline PSA restart abiraterone continue abiraterone develop radiographic disease progression . If decline performance status occur time radiographic disease progression , participant follow develop radiographic disease progression . The study terminate early less 3 first 10 enrolled participant complete 2 cycle adaptive abiraterone .</detailed_description>
