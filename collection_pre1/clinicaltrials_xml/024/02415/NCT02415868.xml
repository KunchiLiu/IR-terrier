	<brief_summary>This purpose study collect vaginal microbial sample postmenopausal woman ass optimal condition cultivation storage vaginal microbiota . These sample subsequently use develop high-throughput assay mimicks vaginal microbial community postmenopausal woman . This assay use select screen compound affect vaginal microbiota subsequently affect relate symptom vaginal dryness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ex Vivo High-Throughput Assay Vaginal Community Post-menopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaginal swab collect post-menopausal woman ( 5 woman vaginal pH ≤4.5 5 woman vaginal pH≥5.5 ) , age 45 - 75 , least 12 month amenorrhea . Enough woman screen ensure five woman pH range . Using speculum , mid lateral vaginal wall make visible , sample collect physician nurse use flocked swab . After collection , vaginal swab store immediately adequate liquid medium 4ºC transport lab within 7 hour sample storage culture material . The vaginal microbiota post-menopausal woman vaginal pH ≤ 4.5 ≥ 5.5 characterize compare use 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid ( rRNA ) sequencing . In additional , optimal condition cultivation storage vaginal microbiota examine use assay mimic vaginal microbial community postmenopausal woman .</detailed_description>
