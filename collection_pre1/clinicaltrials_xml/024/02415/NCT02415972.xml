	<brief_title>Dynamic Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Imaging Cerebral Perfusion Measurement Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Stroke personal , familial social disaster . Apart development stroke prevention treatment strategy , mainstay stroke research remain new-product development improvement current imaging tool diagnosis , monitor follow-up stroke patient . For initial neuroradiological work-up , usually compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use detect presence absence , effective state extent stroke . However , rapid actual availability , especially primary hospital , dynamic capability predictive value infarction poor . Currently cerebral CT-perfusion ( CTP ) image regard gold standard assess tissue hypoperfusion set . It employ , however , contrast agent X-ray exposition patient repeatedly transfer scan unit measurement . Therefore , fast , simple , repeatable , non-hazardous non-invasive dynamic bedside tool detection acute brain tissue hypoperfusion monitor potential infarction efficacy thrombolysis ischemic stroke strongly need . Socioeconomic importance stroke Stroke first cause acquire disability , second cause dementia third cause death worldwide , associate socio-economic cost astronomic . The burden stroke likely increase , give age population grow incidence many vascular risk factor . Therefore , rational effective diagnostic therapeutic management stroke patient potential high long-term clinical economic consequence . Current standard therapy acute ischemic stroke According cause stroke apart medical treatment surgical option select case , mainstay therapeutic management acute ischemic stroke usually remain systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) selective intraarterial fibrinolysis mechanical recanalization , without bridge ( combine intravenous intraarterial thrombolysis ) . In regard , reperfusion therapy proven treatment acute ischemic stroke . Current problem diagnosis monitor stroke patient At present , CT MRI usually apply diagnosis follow-up stroke . However , CT MRI achieve simply baseline study ischemia occur deliver snapshot brain parenchyma vessel . Furthermore , whereas CT examination associate x-ray radiation may miss early detection stroke , MRI associate high cost generally routinely around-the clock available hospital . Both image method require transportation intensive care often critically ill patient scan unit measurement . There unanimous agreement need bedside assessment status tissue perfusion . Invasive cerebral angiography indicate case evaluation stroke cause intend endovascular therapy . Potential ultrasound perfusion imaging ( UPI ) What make contrast enhanced UPI valuable possibility repeatedly non-invasively detect brain tissue risk infarction direct brain tissue perfusion assessment surrogate parameter , like blood flow velocity vessel diameter . Because possibility screen repeatedly measure state perfusion , chance increase diagnose monitor ischemic stroke define appropriate window treatment . The perfusion analysis would also allow determination treatment result guidance rapid adequate therapy . Objective The objective present study ass whether cerebral hypoperfusion detect ultrasound perfusion imaging ( UPI ) treatment acute ischemic stroke . Methods Patients acute middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) territory ischemic stroke evaluate potential thrombolysis/thrombectomy accord Bernese neurologic stroke algorithm . An experienced neurosonographer performs contrast-enhanced ultrasound perfusion imaging ( UPI ) prospective study enrollment specific stroke CT/MRI perfusion measurement . Clinical status document use NIHSS admission /first day intervention . UPI CT/MRI perfusion data analyze . Two different quantification algorithm , standard versus patient-adjusted , use . Data analyze descriptive statistic use mean , median standard deviation ROIs . Sensitivity specificity analysis calculate use Pearson ` chi-square test . Receiver-operator characteristic curve calculate UPI/perfusion MRI/CT parameter . Pearson correlation use evaluate correlation absolute value UPI MRI TTP data .</detailed_description>
