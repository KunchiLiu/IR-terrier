	<brief_summary>The aim project evaluate efficacy influenza vaccine individual major depressive disorder ( MDD ) well elucidate nature immunological abnormality MDD use quasi-experimental design . Specifically , investigator plan induce transient , mild inflammation medically-healthy study participant use influenza vaccine . Initially investigator conduct pilot project 20 individual order evaluate time-point peak inflammatory response vaccine occur . Subjects receive seasonal influenza vaccine provide blood sample 4 hour , 2 day , 30 day post vaccination . Subsequent pilot study , depress psychiatrically-healthy participant randomize parallel group , double-blind design receive either influenza vaccine ( seasonal vaccine ) saline ( i.m ) . At baseline , subject provide blood sample , complete number rating scale measure mood fatigue , may complete approximately one hour MRI scanning without simultaneous EEG recording . Two-days post vaccination , provide second blood sample , complete clinical rating may complete another identical MRI session without simultaneous EEG . Four week later , participant ask return provide third blood sample complete additional clinical rating . The blood sample use measure innate adaptive immune function may use correlate vaccine-induced immunological change neurophysiological change brain measure MRI and/or EEG .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Psychological stress show impair efficacy influenza vaccine , particularly old individual ( &gt; 60 year ) . However , effect depression ( opposed stress per se ) vaccine response measure , especially young people . One possible cause putative impaired vaccine response suppression immune system subgroup individual depression . Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) associate decline total number circulate B-cells , T-cells , natural killer cell ( NKC ) , reduction proliferative response NKC T-cells vitro ameliorate administration selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , increase susceptibility various viral infection , decline efficacy herpes zoster vaccine elderly ( 1 , 2 ) . On hand , MDD appear also characterize immunological abnormality manifest low-grade inflammation , include over-activity innate immune system ( 3 ) . Whether inflammation immune suppression two different manifestation underlie abnormality ( unitary model ) whether inflammation immune suppression distinct phenomena occur different MDD subtypes ( independent model ) know . MDD also characterize neurophysiological abnormality striatal , cortical midline , limbic brain structure regulate hormonal , autonomic , emotional response reward stress ( 4-6 ) . Yet , remain unclear immune function relate depression-associated functional neuroimaging abnormality . Studies healthy volunteer ( HCs ) administer endotoxin typhoid vaccine report inflammation-associated increase negative affect along neurophysiological change brain region comprise affective reward circuitry ( 7-8 ) . However , study limit HCs , possible observe inflammation-induced neurophysiological change adaptive therefore applicable MDD population . That , remain unclear whether experimentally-induced immune abnormality MDD correlate therefore potentially causally-related neuroimaging abnormality observe MDD . In order address question , use parallel group , placebo-controlled influenza vaccine challenge induce transient inflammation peak 2-days post vaccination MDD subject HCs . Subjects may complete pre-and-post vaccination MRI scan , latter peak inflammatory response . Aim 1 : To examine whether influenza vaccine effectiveness compromise young-to-middle-aged sample ( 18-55 year age ) individual MDD . Hypothesis 1.1 . Compared HCs ( n=40 ) , individual MDD ( n=40 ) display reduce vaccine titer reduce influenza virus-induced CD4+ memory T-cell proliferation four week post vaccination ( T2 ) . Hypothesis 1.2 . A great number MDD subject HCs fail show four-fold increase antibody titer , conventional standard determine clinically significant response viral vaccine . Aim 2 : To test compete model immune dysfunction MDD . Hypothesis 2.1 . At T0 T1 , stimulate unstimulated monocyte MDD subject show increase interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) production compare HCs . The effect salient T1 individual receive vaccine . Hypothesis 2.2 . Consistent unitary model , monocyte IL-6 and/or TNF production T0 T1 inversely correlate antibody titer T2 MDD group . Aim 3 : To test neurophysiological difference MDD patient HCs rest state cerebral blood flow ( arterial spin label ) , rest EEG activity , BOLD response monetary reward interoceptive stimulus ( fMRI ) T0 T1 , correlate depression-associated perfusion , EEG activity , reward response , interoceptive function immune function T0 T1 . Hypothesis 3.1 : Compared HCs , MDD subject display reduce perfusion subgenual anterior cingulate cortex ( sgACC ) and/or pregenual ACC ( pgACC ) , hemispheric asymmetry alpha ( 8-13 Hz ) power band ( left prefrontal cortex hypoactivation ) , well reduce hemodynamic response anticipatory reward ventral striatum . These difference salient T1 MDD group receive vaccine versus HCs receive vaccine . Hypothesis 3.2 : The functional imaging abnormality MDD group T0 and/or T1 correlate abnormality monocyte activation MDD group T0 and/or T1 .</detailed_description>
