	<brief_title>Effect Inhaled Mometasone/Formoterol Versus Inhaled Fluticasone/Salmeterol Asthma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral airway dysfunction associate poor asthma outcome include asthma exacerbation symptom . The peripheral small airway anatomically define airways 2 mm diameter less . Several technique use evaluate peripheral airway spirometry , body plethysmography , impulse oscillometry image study . Since inhale corticosteroid corner stone treatment asthma , addition long act beta agonist indicate severe asthma poorly control disease despite high dose inhale corticosteroid . The inhaled corticosteroid long act beta agonist available treat asthma . There different result comparison study different inhale corticosteroid long act beta agonist . These difference relate type inhale formulation , potency inhale corticosteroid dose outcome measurement . The previous short term study show inhaled budesonide/formoterol superior inhale fluticasone/salmeterol combination reduce peripheral airway resistance measure impulse oscillometry . However , active drug deliver use dry powder inhaler . There direct comparison inhale mometasone/formoterol inhale fluticasone/salmeterol administer use meter dose inhaler . For reason , conduct open label study compare effect two inhale corticosteroid long act beta agonist newly diagnose asthma eligible treat combination therapy . Eligible patient clinically diagnose asthma require treatment combine inhaled corticosteroid long act beta agonist accord Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA ) guideline . The patient randomize receive either inhaled mometasone/formoterol ( 100/5 microgram ) 2 puff twice daily inhale fluticasone/salmeterol ( 125/25 microgram ) 2 puff twice daily administer use meter dose inhaler . The primary outcome peripheral airway function measure airway resistance 5 20 Hz frequency impulse oscillometry . The secondary outcome peak expiratory flow rate , force expiratory flow 1 second , forced vital capacity , force expiratory flow 25-75 % vital capacity ( FEF25-75 % ) measure spirometry , residual volume per total lung capacity ratio measure body plethysmography , asthma control test score asthma control questionaire-7 version . All outcome measure baseline 6-week post treatment arm .</detailed_description>
