	<brief_summary>Children sarcomas routinely assessed variety image technique involve use ionizing radiation . These include compute tomography ( CT ) , nuclear bone scan , positron emission tomography-CT ( PET-CT ) . Pediatric sarcoma patient undergo many image study time diagnosis , therapy year follow completion therapy . Because child stage rapid growth , tissue organ susceptible harmful effect ionize radiation adult . Furthermore , compare adult , child longer life expectancy , therefore , long period time develop adverse sequela radiation exposure , development second malignancy . Alternative experimental method measure tumor response compare current standard care measure determine experimental method equivalent method currently use . Investigators wish determine reduce patient 's exposure harmful effect ionize radiation replace image study use radiation whole body diffusion weight magnetic resonance imaging ( DW-MRI ) use radiation . They also want know DW-MRI measurement tumor tell well tumor respond therapy . There study adult cancer show DW-MRI provide useful information tumor respond therapy . There small study DW-MRI child tumor body . Therefore , role DW-MRI pediatric sarcoma patient yet know still experimental . This study might give u important information could help u treat child bone soft tissue sarcoma future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Younger Patients With Newly Diagnosed Bone Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whole body ( WB ) primary tumor diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) perform baseline subject . Additional DW-MRIs do 3 time treatment time routine MRI examination schedule . Follow-up primary tumor DWI MRI examination perform time point determine participant 's therapeutic treatment protocol . Follow-up primary tumor DWI examination perform completion local control ( surgical resection completion radiation therapy ) . All examination perform 1.5T Siemens magnetic resonance ( MR ) scanners unless clinical indication 3T imaging . Because investigator correlate image parameter patient outcome , participant follow discharge After Completion Therapy Clinic tumor progression recurrence develop second malignancy death , whichever come first . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : - To estimate proportion pediatric sarcoma patient whose bone/bone marrow soft-tissue metastasis status correctly stag whole body diffusion weight MRI ( WB DWI ) time diagnosis compare clinical stage . - To determine correlation change primary pediatric sarcoma 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG PET ) maximum standardized uptake value ( SUVmax ) average DWI apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value baseline ( pre-treatment ) prior local control . OTHER PRESPECIFIED OBJECTIVES : - To estimate sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , negative positive predictive value WB DWI , PET-CT PET-CT + bone scan detecting site metastatic tumor pediatric sarcoma use biopsy clinical follow-up ( include image study clinical information ) reference standard . - To compare ability WB MRI , PET-CT PET-CT + bone scan detect sit metastasis pediatric sarcoma patient use biopsy clinical judgment reference standard . - To examine association DWI ADC value primary tumor diagnosis treatment protocol driven time point therapy tumor histology , tumor grade , RECIST response , % tumor necrosis , FDG SUVmax patient outcome . - To compare whole body DWI conventional T1W STIR whole body MRI detection nodal , bone/bone marrow , soft-tissue lung metastasis among pediatric bone soft-tissue sarcoma patient use biopsy clinical judgment reference standard .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All St Jude patient know suspected , newly diagnose bone softtissue sarcoma treat per disease specific protocol . Study subject undergone schedule PETCT and/or bone scan within 2 week WB primary tumor DWI MRI . No limit age gender Informed consent assent sign study subject parent/guardian accord institutional guideline . Patients begin therapy , , need research imaging perform within 25 day start therapy . Subject tumor undergo upfront resection Subject unable unwilling follow study requirement , include sign consent assent Subject hospitalize intensive care unit . Subject meet institutional MRI safety screening requirement . Subject undergone primary tumor resection prior arrival St. Jude . Subjects require sedation WB MRI exclude : An acute cardiopulmonary process include , limited , croup , reactive airway disease , pneumonia , clinical radiological evidence pericardial effusion cardiopulmonary disease . Vomiting within 24 hour MRI substantial nausea may preclude sedation determine anesthesiologist certify registered nurse anesthetist .</criteria>
