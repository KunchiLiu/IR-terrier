	<detailed_description>Ticagrelor oral , reversibly-binding , direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist use clinically prevention atherothrombotic event patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Guideline recommendation use dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) formulate ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin preference clopidogrel 75mg daily plus aspirin patient ACS without ST-segment elevation . These recommendation primarily base large , randomize , Phase III clinical trial . However , East Asian patient ( East Asian descent ) include trial ass use drug . In addition , grow body data support East Asian might different adverse event profile ( thrombophilia bleed ) `` therapeutic window '' compare white subject . Furthermore , `` East Asian paradox '' phenomenon describe East Asian patient higher prevalence platelet reactivity DAPT , ischaemic event rate follow PCI ACS similar even low white patient . Therefore , antiplatelet treatment strategy appropriate East Asian patient increasingly urgent . In Korea Japan , report low dos ticagrelor potent inhibition platelet aggregation ( IPA ) clopidogrel ( 75 mg daily ) healthy subject patient stable coronary artery disease , respectively . But still clear whether low dose ticagrelor superior clopidogrel large population Chinese ACS patient . A recent study pharmacokinetics tolerability ticagrelor find maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) area plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) ticagrelor ( 90 mg twice daily ) active metabolite ( AR-C124910XX ) tend approximately 40 % high healthy Chinese volunteer compare Caucasian subject . This data also suggest low dose ticagrelor might appropriate Chinese ACS patient . In view large diurnal variation single daily dose , low dose twice daily may better choice Chinese patient . Therefore , perform current study observe different effect low-dose ticagrelor ( 45 mg twice daily ) , conventional-dose ticagrelor ( 90 mg twice daily ) clopidogrel ( 75mg daily ) high platelet reactivity ( HPR ) IPA , investigate safety efficacy low-dose ticagrelor Chinese patient non-ST-elevation ACS ( NSTE-ACS ) .</detailed_description>
