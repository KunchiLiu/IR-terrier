	<brief_summary>Patients include study receive induction treatment 6 month , follow receive high-dose therapy follow peripheral blood stem cell transplantation . Approximately 3 month peripheral blood stem cell transplantation patient receive consolidation treatment 2 month . Subsequently patient start maintenance treatment 24 month . Therefore , total duration treatment approximately 36 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Treatment Patients Under 65 Years With High Risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial multicenter Phase II study design evaluate efficacy toxicity intensive therapeutic approach 90 patient asymptomatic high risk multiple myeloma ( SMM ) . 1 . - Patients receive induction treatment consist 6 cycle carfilzomib , lenalidomide low-dose dexamethasone ( KRd ) : patient receive carfilzomib 20-36 mg/m2 IV day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 16 ; oral lenalidomide 25 mg daily day 1-21 , subsequently rest period week ( day 22 day 27 ) . Moreover , oral dexamethasone 40mg daily administer weekly ( day 1 , 8 , 15 22 ) . 2 . - Following induction treatment , patient receive high-dose ( 200 mg/m2 ) melphalan-based treatment administer via intravenous route follow peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( HDT-ASCT ) . 3 . - The consolidation treatment consist 2 cycle KRd , dose schedule induction treatment . 4 . - Maintenance treatment : patient , without progression symptomatic multiple myeloma toxicity require discontinuation trial , receive maintenance treatment 24 cycle . This maintenance treatment comprise administration lenalidomide 10mg day 1-21 , follow rest period 1 week , weekly administration dexamethasone 20mg . Treatment administrated end maintenance , although patient continue trial . If biological progression observe following discontinuation treatment , lenalidomide dexamethasone reinstituted order control disease . Lenalidomide 10 mg administrated day 1-21 combine dexamethasone 20mg day 1 , 8 , 15 22 . All patient monitor asymptomatic disease progression collect data regard overall survival ( OS ) .</detailed_description>
