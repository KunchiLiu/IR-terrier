	<brief_title>A Trial Assess Optimal Postoperative Feeding Regiments Following Pyloromyotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . SUMMARY AND SPECIFIC AIMS B . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS C. REFERENCES SUMMARY AND SPECIFIC AIMS Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis condition well know pediatric surgeon , deem `` common cause surgery first 6 month life '' . This condition affect large group child annually incidence 1.8 per 1000 birth . Postoperative length hospital stay financial concern remain potential target reduction hospital cost . Ultimately , cost directly affect ability effectively advance postoperative enteral nutrition . Some expert calculate saving $ 392.00 per patient others estimate impressive $ 1,290 save per patient . There several choice consider determine timing initiation enteral feed follow pyloromyotomy . Some practice pattern initiate feeding soon infant awakens anesthesia . Some author suggest period withhold feeding several hour postoperatively , others recommend significantly long period starvation ( 18 hour ) initiate feeding . The ongoing debate arise whether physician chooses standardize , incremental feed regimen versus ad libitum feed schedule allow infant decide much eat . Neither study effectively randomize control setting . A recent review literature would suggest period 4 hour NPO , follow ad lib feeding may best postoperative regimen . This however , study randomize , control trial . The investigator therefore hypothesize 1 ) infant provide ad lib diet follow pyloromotomy progress rapidly full volume feed infant provide incremental advancement diet , 2 ) Preoperative blood chemistry abnormality predict increase emesis postoperatively . Therefore , specific aim study determine whether : 1 . Infants provide ad lib feed follow pyloromyotomy progress quickly goal feed ( 100ml/kg/day ) able discharge rapidly . 2 . Preoperative abnormality potassium , chloride , bicarbonate predict increase postoperative emesis B. RESESRCH DESIGN AND METHODS B1 . Experimental Design . Specific Aim 1 . Hypothesis : Infants provide ad lib feed follow pyloromyotomy progress quickly goal feed ( 100ml/kg/day ) able discharge rapidly . Rationale : If infant able reach goal feed quickly without experience significant emesis , may able discharge quickly , thereby decrease hospital cost associate long hospital stay Experimental protocol : Infants examine assessed diagnosis pyloric stenosis . Infants diagnose base standard care measure ( clinical , ultrasound UGI finding ) preoperative blood chemistry draw per standard care . At time surgical consent obtain , attend fellow physician educate parent study obtain consent wish participate . The unit randomization child . Randomization do use numbered , seal , security envelope available investigator pediatric surgery office . Half envelop assign child `` Standard/Incremental '' feed regimen , half assign child `` Ad-lib '' regimen . The envelope arrange box random order . The investigator select open envelope sequentially enrollment informed consent parent child . Standard Incremental 1 . NPO 4 hour follow surgery 2 . Initiate Pedialyte 15ml PO Q2 hour x 2 feed 3 . Then switch formula breastmilk 30ml PO Q2 hour x 2 feed 4 . Then increase 1 . 45ml PO Q3 hour x 2 feed , 2. goal ( 100ml/kg/day ) goal volume le 45 ml 5 . Then advance goal feed ( 100ml/kg/day ) PO Q3 hour 2 feed 6 . `` Time goal feed '' record infant tolerate two consecutive goal feed without vomit get ready third feed 7 . Infants remain IV fluid tolerate goal feed maintain glycemic control hydration - If vomit ensues stage , repeat volume feed tolerates 2 total feeding volume advance - If infant vomit three volume feed row , skip next feed restart volume thereafter . If vomit still persist , hold next two feed restart feed volume thereafter - Reglan may use first 72 hour postoperatively Ad-lib 1 . NPO 4 hour follow surgery 2 . Ad-lib formula breastfeeds tolerate goal feed ( 100ml/kg/day ) x 2 total feed . Feedings limit 12.5ml/kg per feed avoid overdistention stomach 3 . `` Time goal feed '' record infant tolerate two consecutive goal feed without vomit get ready third feed 4 . Infants remain IV fluid tolerate goal feed maintain glycemic control hydration - If infant vomit three feed row , skip next feed restart ad lib feed thereafter . - Reglan may use first 72 hour postoperatively Infants need tolerate two goal feed without vomit prior discharge . After tolerate two feed , infant need stay hospital time third feed . The initiation third feed note `` time goal feed . '' Additional variable record include age , sex , birth weight , gestational age birth , preoperative weight , preoperative day vomit , preoperative resuscitation volume , dimension pylorus ultrasound/UGI , preoperative blood chemistry , laparoscopic open procedure , parental satisfaction feed regimen . Additionally , phone call make within 7-14 day follow discharge assess infant clinical status well continue parental satisfaction . Parents infant consent randomization ask allow perioperative data collection get baseline entire pyloric stenosis population . The infant whose data collect randomized data include randomization analysis Specific Aim 2 . Hypothesis : . Preoperative abnormality potassium , chloride , bicarbonate predict increase postoperative emesis . Rationale : A single previous study suggest degree preoperative dehydration , particularly associate blood chemistry abnormality potassium , chloride , bicarbonate , may predict infant vomit postoperatively . If able identify , infant may benefit tailored feeding regiment postoperatively . Experimental protocol : Post hoc analysis undertaken confirm preoperative blood chemistry abnormality predict postoperative emesis . Also , able determine incremental adlib feed regiment best suit population infant well .</detailed_description>
