	<brief_title>Pomalidomide Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent , Progressive Refractory Central Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) pomalidomide , child &gt; = 3 year &lt; 21 year age recurrent , progressive refractory central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor give daily 21 consecutive day 28-day course . II . To describe toxicity profile dose-limiting toxicity pomalidomide child &gt; = 3 year &lt; 21 year age recurrent , progressive refractory CNS tumor . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics pomalidomide administer orally child &gt; = 3 year old &lt; 21 year age recurrent , progressive refractory CNS tumor study association pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter age steroid use . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore preliminary efficacy pomalidomide patient population define radiographic response rate , duration response , event-free survival ( EFS ) within confines Phase 1 study . *For purpose study , long-term stable disease consider response ( define stable disease &gt; = 6 course ) . II . To investigate relationship pomalidomide dose exposure radiographic response change immune function ( example , T-cell subset , natural killer [ NK ] cell activity , granzyme B circulating level interleukin [ IL ] -12 , IL-2 , IL-15 , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [ GM-CSF ] ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive pomalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
