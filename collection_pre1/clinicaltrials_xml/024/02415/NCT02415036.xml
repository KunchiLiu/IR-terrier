	<brief_title>Melphalan Use With Hepatic Delivery System Treatment Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Intra Hepatic Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two arm , open label , multi-center , Phase 2 study evaluate efficacy safety Melphalan/HDS patient unresectable HCC ICC confine liver . Eligible patient receive 2 Melphalan/HDS treatment . Each treatment cycle consist 6 week acceptable delay another 2 week next planned treatment . Tumor response assess end cycle 2 . The Melphalan/HDS treatment terminate patient progressive disease ( PD ) 1st treatment base safety patient &gt; 8 week delay recovery toxicity .</detailed_description>
