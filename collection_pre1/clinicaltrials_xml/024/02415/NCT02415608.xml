	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study ibrutinib see well work treat patient systemic ( affect entire body ) mastocytosis spread part body usually cure controlled treatment ( advanced ) . Systemic mastocytosis disease many mast cell ( type immune system cell ) find throughout body . Mast cell give chemical histamine cause flushing ( hot , red face ) , itch , abdominal cramp , muscle pain , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , low blood pressure , shock . Ibrutinib may stop growth mast cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate ibrutinib patient advance systemic mastocytosis ( SM ) ( aggressive systemic mastocytosis [ ASM ] mast cell leukemia [ MCL ] , SM-associated hematologic non-mast cell disorder [ AHNMD ] ) end 6 cycle ( 6 month ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tolerability safety profile ibrutinib patient advance SM . II . To evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile ibrutinib subset patient advance SM . III . To evaluate change histopathology ( blood bone marrow ) patient advance SM response ibrutinib therapy . IV . To evaluate change mastocytosis related symptom score quality-of-life ( QOL ) use modify Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form ( MPNSAF ) . V. To evaluate duration response ( DoR ) time response ( TTR ) . VI . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve unconfirmed confirmed clinical improvement ( CI ) , partial response ( PR ) , complete response ( CR ) end course 6 permit continue maintenance course ibrutinib ongoing basis loss response/progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
