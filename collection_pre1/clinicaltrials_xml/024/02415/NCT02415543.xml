	<brief_title>SIL-TEP v TEP Inguinal Hernia Repair Day Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomizedï¼Œcontrolled trail . It compare Single Incisional Laparoscopic Total Extraperitonea ( SIL-TEP ) traditional Laparoscopic Total Extraperitoneal ( TEP ) Inguinal Hernia Repair condition day surgery . Laparoscopic hernia repair technique include two tyes , TEP TAPP , recognize mordern minimally invasive technique . Laparoscopic hernia repair recommend Association Surgeons Great Britain Ireland ( ASGBI ) European Hernia Society Guideline ( EHS ) first choice primary inguinal hernia . Compared TAPP , TEP perform much frequently advantage avoid abdominal visceral injury . Traditional TEP hernia repair involve 3-port insertion : one incision 2cm para-umbilical region camera two small incision 5mm midline surgical instrument . Some surgeon think second third port could lead bowel bladder injury . Early literature show bowel injury bladder injury observe TAPP TEP hernia repair . Since 2009 , Cugura JF Filipovic-Cugura J lead team preliminary exploration SIL-TEP . Later , several case report surgical technique globally . Since , number retrospective study comparation SIL-TEP traditional TEP carry . Yang GP et al find SIL-TEP long operation time traditional TEP , term postoperative complication incision aesthetic . Tu Wenbin et al think SIL-TEP effective also advantage postoperative pain , postoperative complication time hospital . Several report also similiar opnions . However , randomize control trial relate suject quite limited . Our study aim compare efficacy safety SIL-TEP traditional TEP surgery RCT design also aim improve surgical-related technical detail device design . Our study also evaluate operability SIL-TEP term day surgery item try provide basis SIL-TEP day surgery guildline , promote SIL-TEP technology country .</detailed_description>
