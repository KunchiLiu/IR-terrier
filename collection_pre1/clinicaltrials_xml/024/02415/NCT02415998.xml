	<detailed_description>The aim study ass whether transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) use successfully guide epidural catheter target thoracic level pediatric patient . The catheter place epidural space real-time TEE image assistance train TEE operator . The primary outcome determine success rate achieve use TEE guidance thread epidural catheter target thoracic spinal level . Post-operative radiograph use confirm catheter position . The secondary outcome include analysis catheter tip position within epidural space anterior , lateral inferior spinal cord . Further , efficacy catheter determine use follow criterion previous study : Hemodynamic response skin incision analyze heart rate systemic blood pressure change use change HR BP change &lt; 20 % baseline consider `` sufficient block '' surgical stimulation , HR BP change &gt; 20 % baseline consider `` sufficient block '' surgical stimulation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>pediatric patient schedule undergo cardiothoracic surgery interventional cardiology diagnostic procedure general anesthesia . All subject also schedule undergo postoperative chest xray routine part clinical care , additional exposure ionize radiation occur due study . patient know esophageal abnormality , lesion disease would disqualify patient use TEE standard procedure . We exclude patient solely undergoing TEE diagnostic procedure include patient already schedule undergo procedure TEE use part routine surgical preparation .</criteria>
