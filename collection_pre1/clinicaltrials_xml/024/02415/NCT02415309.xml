	<brief_summary>Lumbar medial branch block commonly use diagnostic tool facet-mediated chronic low back pain . This interventional pain procedure often occur fluoroscopy suite . During procedure , physician insert needle deliver local anesthetic lidocaine bupivacaine nerve innervate lumbar facet joint . Many patient experience anxiety lumbar medial branch block procedure require intravenous midazolam fentanyl sedation . Intravenous conscious sedation require one-to-one nursing care , monitoring , recovery . In order minimize cost time requirement intravenous sedation , suitable oral medication readily available non-controlled would ideal . Several randomized double-blinded , controlled trial investigate anxiolytic effect melatonin surgery ; however study date study anxiolytic effect melatonin less invasive interventional pain procedure . This study design evaluate efficacy melatonin reduce anxiety patient undergo lumbar medial branch block procedure . The study randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial 40 patient group : 2 mg melatonin , 10 mg melatonin placebo . The primary outcome anxiety reduction patient undergoing procedure . The primary outcome measure visual numerical rating scale anxiety Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety Information Scale . Based result previous study , investigator hypothesize melatonin may reduce anxiety patient undergoing procedure suitable alternative intravenous sedation pain clinic patient undergo lumbar medial branch block .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic low back pain common disease industrialized country affect patient ' productivity quality life . Currently , estimate yearly prevalence chronic low back pain United States 5-20 % . Lumbar medial branch block ( LMBB ) commonly use diagnostic tool facet mediate chronic low back pain . This interventional pain procedure often occur fluoroscopy suite . During procedure , physician insert needle deliver local anesthetic lidocaine bupivacaine nerve innervate lumbar facet joint . Many patient experience anxiety LMBB procedure require intravenous midazolam fentanyl sedation . In fact , retrospective review 8,000 interventional fluoroscopically guide pain procedure , high incidence vasovagal episode occur LMBB procedure . A nurse require administer medication monitor patient 's vital sign . In addition , recovery medication unduly prolong patient visit , case fentanyl , confound diagnostic utility LMBB procedure decrease patient 's pain . In effort minimize cost administration , monitor , time recovery maximize diagnostic utility LMBBs , suitable alternative require . Several randomized , double-blinded , controlled trial investigate anxiolytic effect melatonin surgery . Several study review article describe use melatonin sedation anxiolysis adult child . However , study date describe use melatonin anxiolysis sedation interventional pain medicine procedure . Melatonin ( ( N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine ) over-the-counter product patient take reduce anxiety procedure ; hormone produce pineal gland secrete blood cerebrospinal fluid . Melatonin several function include regulation circadian rhythm regulation reproductive axis antioxidant activity . Exogenous melatonin use treat insomnia jet lag .</detailed_description>
