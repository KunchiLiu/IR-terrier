	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient often ventilate dedicated critical care unit provide respiratory support . Despite best practice patient often develop condition call adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , characterise deterioration respiratory function , change chest x-ray . The correct management ARDS identify underlying condition cause deterioration identify appropriate target therapy . One cause pneumonia , cause bacterial infection lung ventilate patient . The patient may ventilate due pneumonia may also develop pneumonia whilst ventilate . Ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) significant mortality . Despite clinical laboratory data investigator ' disposal remain great difficulty accurate diagnosis pneumonia therefore treatment often give empirically . Therefore , urgent clinical need accurate method diagnose presence bacteria deep lung ventilate critically ill patient . As , investigate team develop synthesise image agent call BAC TWO . BAC TWO instill directly lungs 12 patient assess whether label gram-negative bacteria human lung .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study Intrapulmonary Microdosing Gram-negative Optical Imaging Detection Probe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study deliver BAC TWO microdose 3 ventilated control 9 patient assess image parameter BAC TWO human autofluorescence ass gram-negative bacteria detect vivo situ within distal lung . The primary endpoint visualise delivery microdose BAC TWO ass image parameter ; - 3 mechanically ventilated patient provide control population ( cohort 1 ) - 3 bronchiectasis patient predominant colonisation gram-negative bacteria ( cohort 2 ) - 3 bronchiectasis patient predominant colonisation gram-positive bacteria ( cohort 3 ) - 3 patient suspect pneumonia pulmonary infiltrates ICU ( cohort 4 ) For cohort , eligibility verify clinical trial physician write informed consent obtain . For cohort , bronchoscopy lavage perform harvest broncho-alveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) . Fibre-based endomicroscopy ( FE ) perform three area 80μg ( ± 25 % ) total BAC TWO instill 3 site . Participants ask provide additional blood urine sample intention examine systemic uptake BAC TWO probe . Routine blood investigation perform 4-6 hour follow administration BAC TWO . The completion assessments 4-6 hour post dose mark end participant 's participation study unless ongoing adverse event require resolution . The primary aim measure bronchoscopy routine investigation complete 6 hour post dose .</detailed_description>
