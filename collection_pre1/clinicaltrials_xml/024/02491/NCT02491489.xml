	<brief_summary>Shoulder pain one common musculoskeletal condition treat physical therapist . One common treatment passive glenohumeral joint accessory mobilization , application therapist generate force move humeral head ( ball ) glenoid ( socket ) shoulder improve motion decrease pain . It generally accept mobilization elicit active muscular contraction surround musculature . However , little literature support assumption , preliminary PubMed search utilizing term `` shoulder '' , '' mobilization '' , `` EMG '' return zero relevant reference . Therefore , investigator plan utilize surface electromyography ( EMG ) , non-invasive assessment tool , objectively measure activity rotator cuff muscle ( muscle surround shoulder provide stability joint ) various grade ( level force amplitude movement ) glenohumeral mobilization ( standard care treatment ) . It also unknown subject pain level impact level rotator cuff activity . To investigate question , investigator collect EMG data perform mobilization total 20 subject , divide two group : 10 pain free shoulder 10 painful shoulder . Data analysis include descriptive analysis , estimate effect size , analysis group difference . The investigator hypothesize significant difference muscular activity group relate presence shoulder pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activity Rotator Cuff During Glenohumeral Mobilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following informed consent , participant assess private EMG lab setting . After expose posterior shoulder girdle , area upper trapezius , supraspinatus , infraspinatus clean use cloth alcohol prep pad , skin area electrode placement vigorously abrade 5 second . A previously calibrate ( per Delsys system protocol ) Delsys mini-wireless electrode place appropriate location muscle describe Criswell . These electrode securely tap place use specialized tape specify manufacturer . Once electrode placement complete , participant first undergo standardize reference contraction muscle group . For upper trapezius , consist 1 ) 9 second shrug,2 ) 9 second elevation arm 90 degree empty position , 3 ) side lie external rotation shoulder 90 degree . The middle 3 second trial use record average electrical activity muscle voluntary contraction . Participants place supine standard plinth . The investigator proceed provide mobilize force subject 's glenohumeral joint . Each two investigator , sequence perform 15 second longitudinal distraction , follow 15 second posteriorly direct glenohumeral glide shoulder place open pack rest position ( ~50 degree abduction , slight horizontal adduction , external rotation ) . The middle 5 second captured mean electrical activity three previously identify muscle . Following completion mobilization second investigator , electrodes remove , subject 's participation complete . Data analysis include basic subject demographic age , gender , handedness . Tests group difference analyze mobilization tester condition . Data analyze compare mean EMG value mobilization compare active contraction use reference voluntary contraction ( RVC ) method , show accurate comparator low level muscle activity .</detailed_description>
