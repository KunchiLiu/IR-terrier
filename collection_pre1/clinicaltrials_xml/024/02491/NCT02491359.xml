	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study well carfilzomib work treat patient chronic graft-versus-host disease . Chronic graft-versus-host disease complication donor bone marrow blood cell transplant , usually occur three month transplant , donor cell damage host tissue . Carfilzomib may effective treatment chronic graft-versus-host disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine proportion subject treatment failure 6 month carfilzomib therapy chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 3 month overall ( complete + partial ) , complete response rate . II . Determine 6 month overall ( complete + partial ) , complete response rate . III . Report overall survival , non-relapse mortality , primary malignancy relapse , failure-free survival , treatment success , discontinuation immune suppression 6 month 1 year . IV . Examine functional outcome ( 2-minute walk test ) patient-reported outcome ( Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale , quality life [ Short Form Health Survey ( SF ) -36 , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy Bone Marrow Transplant ( FACT-BMT ) Questionnaire ] , Human Activity Profile [ HAP ] ) study enrollment , 6 month , 1 year . V. Study biologic effect proteasome inhibition . OUTLINE : Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously ( IV ) approximately 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
