	<detailed_description>Exploratory/correlative objective : To systematically evaluate HER2/neu expression/amplification use standardized scoring criterion breast gastric cancer correlate clinical response uterine serous carcinoma patient HER2/neu score result . To correlate objective response rate , PFS overall survival presence/absence phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit F-box/WD repeat-containing protein mutation standard Sanger sequencing , presence/absence Cyclin E2 overexpression IHC endometrial cancer patient overexpressing HER2/neu treat Afatinib . To study HER2/neu extracellular domain circulating level plasma uterine serous carcinoma patient overexpressing HER2/neu Afatinib treatment elucidate whether change HER2/neu extracellular domain would predict response Afatinib determine peripheral blood natural killer cell number activity HER2/neu+ uterine serous carcinoma patient Afatinib treatment ass possible therapeutic contribution immune mechanisms action Afatinib .</detailed_description>
