	<detailed_description>In order eliminate new pediatric HIV infection , save maternal life , simplify antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) implementation setting generalize HIV epidemic , current World Health Organization ( WHO ) guidance recommend lifelong triple ART pregnant breastfeed woman ( Option B+ ) .

Key amongst challenge adherence ART continuous retention HIV care , especially woman require ART health . Barriers adherence retention care prevention mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) identify individual , interpersonal , community , health facility level ; yet specific barrier context Option B+ well understood . The investigator ' study conduct 20 health facility associate community Nyanza Province , Kenya Mother Child Transmission ( MTCT ) rate prior Option B+ roll-out remain near 10 % , despite wide availability PMTCT service . As Option B+ scale Kenya , essential identify effective method ensure long-term adherence retention care mother-baby pair , throughout pregnancy , breastfeeding , beyond . Building investigate team 's prior research experience setting , investigator propose gain understanding address potential barrier individual , community , health facility level formative research HIV-positive pregnant postpartum woman , male partner , health care provider . This information use refine two propose intervention highly likely maximize ART adherence retention care among HIV-infected pregnant woman HIV-exposed infant . These intervention rigorously test rural Kenya , use cluster randomize 2x2 factorial design . The evidence-based intervention test include 1 ) community Mentor Mothers ( cMM ) provide support ART adherence retention care HIV-positive woman community 2 ) individually tailor , theory base mobile phone text message help retain woman infant HIV care . The investigator ' overall goal determine intervention ( combination intervention ) maximize ART adherence retention care context Option B+ thus improve maternal infant health outcome . The investigator ' primary outcome include ART adherence 12 month postpartum retention care , measure document HIV care visit within 90 day prior 12 month postpartum . Secondary outcome include MTCT 6 week , 12 month 18 month ; well maternal viral load CD4 count . Results study inform scale-up Option B+ Kenya identify effective intervention combination intervention reduce barrier increase facilitator optimal ART adherence retention care aim reach elimination mother child transmission HIV significantly improve maternal health .</detailed_description>
