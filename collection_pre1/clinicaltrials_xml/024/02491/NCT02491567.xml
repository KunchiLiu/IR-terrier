	<detailed_description>Hashimoto Thyroiditis ( HT ) Graves Disease ( GD ) know cause abnormal immune response self cell tissue . HT involve cell-mediated autoimmune destruction thyroid lead hypothyroidism . GD cause process immune cell make stimulating antibody thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) receptor thyroid gland , thus lead hyperthyroidism . Although substantial evidence genetic factor increase risk develop autoimmune disease , monozygotic twin still remain discordant disease ( disease concordance never 100 % ) , thus suggest role environmental factor epigenetics . Epigenetics novel field biology study mechanism environment interacts genotype produce variety phenotype modification chromatin directly alter DNA sequence . These modification associate altered gene expression silence repetitive element inherit mitotically . Epigenetic mechanism include DNA methylation , histone modification , miRNA post-transcriptional regulation . DNA methylation involve covalent addition methyl group carbon-5 position CpG dinucleotide methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine mediate group enzyme call DNA methyltransferases ( DNMTs ) . CpG dinucleotides typically group together region know CGIs ( island ) . CGIs find promoter region gene , CpG methylation gene promoter associate transcriptional silencing . In contrast , hypermethylated gene find transcriptionally active . A limited number epigenetic study publish patient HT GD far . Therefore , purpose study analyze DNA methylation status White Blood Cells ( WBCs ) within promoter region genomic sit previously identify susceptibility locus sit autoimmune thyroid disease , CD40 , FOXP3 , CTLA4 , PTPN22 , CD25 , TPO gene . Initially , recruitment patient control well blood sample collection do . A complete physical examination also perform participant include study , detailed personal , family , gestational perinatal history obtain well inclusion . Blood sample participant collect centrifuged White Blood Cells ( WBCs ) , plasma serum separate stored deep freezer . Laboratory analysis follow . DNA isolate peripheral leukocyte use standard phenol chloroform technique . It treat sodium bisulfite use Zymo EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit , accord manufacturer 's protocol . Therefore , unmethylated cytosine convert uracyls , whereas methylated cytosine remain unchanged . Afterwards , PCR reaction perform , target specific sequence promoter region specific gene promoter ( use specific primer ) . Amplicons analyze electrophoresis visualized ultraviolet trans-illumination , PCR product purify use Millipore Centrifugal Filters DNA purification . A sequence analysis also perform order quantitatively describe methylation status genetic locus study . Finally , online bioinformatics resource employ align obtain sequence ( e.g. , BLAST - http : //blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) subsequently identify methylated unmethylated CpGs site . In case flexibility automation need , bioinformatics script develop scratch accomplish aforementioned task base powerful , open-source bioinformatics software library ( e.g. , Biopython - http : //biopython.org/ ) . An electronic Data Base construct Statistical Analysis follow . Results Conclusions publish peer-review journal present International Meetings .</detailed_description>
