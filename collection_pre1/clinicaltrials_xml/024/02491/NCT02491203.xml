	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause death long-term disability worldwide incidence rise . Importantly , loss arm function occur 85 % stroke survivor , significant long-term impact activity daily live , leisure activity work . The capacity recovery follow stroke depend several factor , include extent initial neurological damage , spontaneous recovery rehabilitation , possible recovery even year stroke . Unfortunately , accessibility much need rehabilitation service poststroke often remain limited , term intensity duration , report recent report post-stroke rehabilitation service Quebec ( Richard , 2013 ) Recent evidence suggest homebased telerehabilitation ( TR ) viable approach upper limb train post-stroke rehabilitation service available . Similarly , Canadian Best Practice Recommendations Stroke Care update 2013 recommend home-based patient monitoring use frequent monitoring need face-to-face visit available . Hence , The investigator develop propose examine use TR system allow upper limb rehabilitation ongoing off-line monitoring , use usual poststroke rehabilitation complete service longer offer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-stroke Upper Limb Rehabilitation Using Telerehabilitation Interactive Virtual Reality System Patient 's Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More specifically , objective propose study assess impact , term motor recovery , function , quality life , compliance , safety cost , novel , patient-centered home-based tailored TR program use affordable virtual reality system upper-limb rehabilitation post-stroke . Such system , combine remote off-line monitoring could allow patient take charge pursue rehabilitation beyond current service , maximize potential recovery . A single-blind two-arm randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) propose study participant stroke randomly allocate : ( 1 ) 4-week train home-based tele-rehabilitation ( TR ) system ( see intervention ) .i.e . treatment group ( 2 ) 4-week write home exercise program provide clinician , i.e . exercise control group .</detailed_description>
