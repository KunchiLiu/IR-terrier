	<brief_summary>The Sponsor develop study drug , AZD9291 , potential treatment nonsmall cell lung cancer . Lung cancer common cancer world several decade represent 12.8 % new cancer case 2008 . The purpose study see much AZD9291 take body dosed mouth ( tablet ) compare study drug dose injection directly vein ( intravenously ) . The dose give directly vein radiolabelled . This mean test drug radioactive component help u track drug body . This allow u detect difference tablet intravenous dose . The study perform 12 healthy male subject age 18-65 year . On Day 1 , subject dose single oral dose 80 milligram AZD9291 tablet follow 100 microgram [ 14C ] AZD9291 dose intravenous microdose begin 5 hour 45 minute oral dose administer . Subjects remain study centre 120 hour post-dose blood sample obtain return clinic visit Day 8 , 10 , 15 22 pharmacokinetic safety assessment .</brief_summary>
