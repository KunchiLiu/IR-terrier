	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy UC-MSCs Patients With Psoriasis Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis consider incurable immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease . The widely used treatment include topical agent , systemic medication biologic agent , drawback limitation . Besides , non-standardized treatment disease may lead transformation disease , add importance find improved management strategy . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) heterogeneous population cell differentiate bone , cartilage fat cell . They several function , migration skin lesion , immunomodulation , limitation autoimmunity local paracrine effect . It report MSCs already use kind autoimmune disease , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , systemic sclerosis , crohn disease , rheumatoid arthritis et al . In study , consent umbilical cord donate healthy donor . After several process step , UC-MSCs separate froze future infusion . When volunteer recruit , condition assess Psoriasis Activity Severity Index ( PASI ) Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) . Then MSCs infuse accord standard scheme . After 6 infusion , patient re-assessed PASI DLQI follow one year .</detailed_description>
