	<detailed_description>1 . INTRUDUCTION 1.1 Background Rationale The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD ) effective tool prevention sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) high-risk patient . The efficacy ICD secondary primary prevention SCD demonstrate several large randomize clinical trial . The evolution clinical trial ICD therapy primary prevention SCD adoption current national practice guideline lead considerable increase use ICDs worldwide . In Arab Gulf region , utilization ICD therapy high-risk patient increase past decade arrival train electrophysiologists Gulf state . While observational study United States Europe evaluate ICD use region , scarce data ICDs use Gulf . Few single center study report early result , date prospective multinational data ICD use Gulf . The Gulf Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry ( GulfICD ) first prospective , multicentre , multinational , observational study patient receive ICDs Arab Gulf state . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS The primary objective study describe characteristic outcomes patient receive ICD Arab Gulf region . Once complete , data collect GulfICD available secondary analysis include description ICD implant indication program pattern Gulf . As observational descriptive study , specific endpoint consider primary . However , main outcome measure include all-cause mortality ICD discharge include appropriate discharge ventricular tachyarrhythmias inappropriate discharge cause . Other endpoint measure include adverse event immediate post-implant period . 3 . STUDY DESIGN Gulf ICD prospective , multicentre , multinational observational study . 4 . SUBJECT SELECTION 4.1 Inclusion Criteria All adult patient 18 year old , receive new ICD implant willing sign consent form eligible . 4.2 Exclusion Criteria Patients &lt; 18 year willing sign consent form . Subjects exist ICDs undergo pulse generator replacement system revision include . 5 . STUDY TREATMENTS All subject treat per routine clinical practice . There study-specific interventions/treatments . 6 . STUDY PROCEDURES 6.1 Subject Withdrawal Subjects right withdraw study anytime . 7 . DATA VARIABLES 7.1 Data Variables Data variable collect detailed attached case-report form ( CRF ) ( Baseline CRF Appendix 1 , Follow Up CRF Appendix 2 ) . Data collect paper CRF enter online . Variables collect baseline include follow domain : 1 . Baseline Demographics , 2 . Admission Characteristics , 3 . Medical History Risk Factors , 4 . Diagnostic Procedures , 5 . ICD Implant Procedure Characteristics , 6 . ICD Programming , 7 . Adverse Events , 8 . Discharge Characteristics , 9 . Discharge Medications , 10 . Interim Events ( follow ) . Variable definition base American College Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society 2006 Key Data Elements Definitions Electrophysiological Studies Procedures American College Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry ( NCDR ) ICD Registry data dictionary ( httpp : //www.ncdr.com/Web NCDR/docs/public-data-collection-documents/icd_v2_datadictionary_codersdictionary_2-1.pdf ? sfvrsn=2 ) 8 . ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 8.1 Adverse Events Reporting Since study-specific intervention/treatment , expect study specific adverse event . However , adverse event may relate ICD implantation collect per attach CRF ( Appendix 1 ) . 9 . DATA ANALYSIS 9.1 Sample Size Considerations Unlike randomize control trial specific hypothesis test primary comparative analysis plan , observational study patient registry typically address descriptive objective . Such objective lend classic sample size/power calculation . Nonetheless , sample size consideration important planning registry . Typically , adequate sample size required ensure adequate precision around key outcome provide sufficient generalizability . With mind , want ensure adequate precision around two key outcome : all-cause mortality and/or rate appropriate ICD discharge one year . To estimate event rate 10 % 1 year margin error 2 % 95 % confidence interval , sample size 829 patient require . Since little guidance literature event rate among ICD recipient Gulf , compensate loss follow-up , adjust sample size upwards 1,000 patient . Sample size later increase 1,500 patient additional funding become available . Such sample size consider logistically feasible give experience ICD implant rate Gulf . 9.2 Statistical Methods Standard descriptive statistic use analyse data . Continuous variable summarize use mean standard deviation median 25th 75th percentile significant deviation normal distribution observe . Categorical variable summarize use count percentage . Basic univariate comparison perform use Student 's t-test Wilcoxon rank sum test appropriate continuous variable , Chi square test categorical variable . Associations baseline variable outcomes follow-up assessed use logistic regression exact event date available Cox proportional hazard model . 10 . QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE There substitute good conscious . The investigator personnel fill CRFs responsible filling form honestly accurately . All form must fill prospectively . Quality control check mechanism implement online CRF system prevent entry inconsistent variable . 11 . DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 11.1 Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records A CRF require collect complete patient . Online data entry CRF available . 11.2 Record Retention Investigators retain paper CRFs per local ethic regulation . Paper CRFs store secure area access available study investigator . The online CRF portal password protect . 12 . ETHICS 12.1 Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee Approval It responsibility investigator get prospective approval study protocol , consent form , amendment local institutional review boards/ethic committee . 12.2 Ethical Conduct Study The study conduct accordance protocol applicable local regulatory requirement law . Study conduct also conform Declaration Helsinki Ethical Principles Medical Research Involving Human Subjects adopt General Assembly World Medical Association 12.3 Subject Information Consent All investigator ensure protection subject ' personal data subject name identifier include report publication study . Each study subject inform study objective procedure question answer . Subjects sign consent form enrol study . The consent form must compliance local regulatory requirement . 13 . SPONSORSHIP GulfICD conduct auspex Gulf Heart Rhythm Society ( GHRS ) Gulf Heart Association ( GHA ) . Partial funding development online CRF portal provide Medtronic , Inc. 14 .
