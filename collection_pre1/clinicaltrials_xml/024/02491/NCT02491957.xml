	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety feasibility LOFT Therapy breast cancer survivor . In previous study , investigator find many patient debilitated diagnosis previously recognize . Both chemotherapy anti-estrogen therapy large effect . Within 6 month patient replace muscle fat lead significant reduction muscle power endurance . Our data suggest common exercise recommendation least 150 minute exercise week would far beyond many patient ' physical ability therapy , lead soreness , injury , frustration , early discontinuation ( failure initiate exercise program first place ) . The degree muscle loss see patient similar document US astronauts long-term space flight . Our collaborator Dr. Yvonne Cagle , retire USAF flight surgeon , note cosmonaut well shape ( less muscle atrophy ) astronauts . This difference could explain rigorous Russian exercise program . The key distinction compressive , `` penguin suit '' use Russians . This observation lead Dr. Cagle develop technique call low intensity , loaded-compressive therapy ( LOFT ) replicate impact Russian penguin suit patient debilitate , whether space flight chronic condition arthritis , Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis . The LOFT method require excessive exertion strain joint . In field observation , LOFT therapy improve muscle strength , muscle mass , endurance , sleep quality , fatigue . This pilot study first evaluate safety , feasibility , biologic impact LOFT breast cancer survivor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact LOFT Therapy™ Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives This pilot trial provide feedback feasibility impact LOFT breast cancer survivor . The investigator also explore relationship LOFT intervention change insulin resistance , growth hormone level , body mass index , patient report physical activity , fatigue , overall quality life . Primary Objective Evaluate safety feasibility LOFT training breast cancer survivor ( &lt; 3 year diagnosis ) treat either chemotherapy and/or anti-estrogen therapy . Secondary Objectives 1 . Estimate effect size LOFT training muscle power , endurance , daily activity , fatigue , quality life . 2 . Estimate effect short-term LOFT training biochemical parameter inflammation , metabolism , anabolic hormone secretion , bone turnover . LOFT Therapy™ Summary LOFT Therapy™ form exercise require less energy movement . LOFT Therapy™ perform 2 time week 4 week total 8 session . The patient wrap fabric cuff , four limb . The cuff apply wide part biceps upper thigh pressure 80-100 mmHg minimal venous encroachment . The patient ride recumbent bike 18 total minute sub-maximal exertion ( 70 % repetition maximum ) , option 2 period 15-second high intensity exertion tolerate , follow individualized respiratory recovery period determine relative decrease breathe effort . The 18-minute session precede two-minute compression check , wrap adjust base sign symptom nerve vessel impingement . Patients undergo intake outtake assessment session collect subjective data patient feedback . Two compression session conduct 4 week , total 8 session . This study enroll 15 patient . A 20 % dropout rate group take consideration investigator assume analysis do least 12 patient .</detailed_description>
