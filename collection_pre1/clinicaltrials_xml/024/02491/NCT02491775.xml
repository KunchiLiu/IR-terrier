	<brief_summary>The investigator propose conduct pilot feasibility study single agent afatinib patient previously untreated metastatic EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) mutant adenocarcinoma lung ( NSCLC = non-small cell lung cancer ) sole purpose characterize genomic landscape afatinib time disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Afatinib Genomic Landscape</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current proposal include exome transcriptome sequencing blood collect baseline along tumor sample obtain prior start afatinib time disease progression ( total two tissue sample one blood sample per patient ) . The sample collect via consent IRB ( Institutional Review Board ) approve banking study `` Tissue Blood Acquisition Genomic Analysis Collection Health Information Patients Thoracic Malignancies , Suspected Thoracic Malignancies , Mesothelioma '' . If carry successfully , propose strategy likely lead large adequately power study ( perhaps use whole genome sequence ) understand fully evolve molecular change due clonal selection treatment pressure . The pace progress field sequence technology currently underway likely accelerate near future yield rich highly content-rich information . Moreover , likely genomic information DNA sequencing transcriptome supplement analysis translatomes proteomes . Successful completion propose study would enable future study fully harness potential emerging technology develop novel approach treat even ideally prevent resistance EGFR TKIs ( tyrosine-kinase inhibitor ) molecularly target therapy . This could serve template cancer type well . Over time , approach , broadly use , would create simultaneously , highly valuable annotated tumor specimen along germ line DNA high-throughput genomic study identify novel target impact course disease . Re-analyzing molecular change tumor time disease progression would likely new standard care guide salvage therapy .</detailed_description>
