Subjects Smokers follow inclusion criterion invite participate RCT : ( 1 ) Aged 18 year ; ( 2 ) Smoke 10 cigarette per day past week ; ( 3 ) Able read speak Chinese ; ( 4 ) Have use NRT past 3 month ; ( 5 ) Have severe angina serious cardiac arrhythmia ; ( 6 ) Have suffer acute myocardial event past 4 week ; ( 7 ) Not pregnant breastfeed The recruitment subject take place 9 outdoor urban place smoker stay smoke July 2015 September 2015 ( To confirm ) Procedures We target train nurse smoke cessation ambassador recruitment provide intervention subject . Recruitment outreach smoke cessation ambassador conduct send mass mail student University Hong Kong . Retired nurse provide counsel service exist smoke cessation project recruit . They invite participate training programme provide overview smoke cessation counsel pharmacotherapy help smoker quit smoking . Our research team ( comprised physician nurse ) develop train material intervention guide base principle US Agency Health Care Policy Research ( AHCPR ) guideline US [ 28 ] , guideline National Institutes Health [ 29 ] World Health Organization [ 30 ] .

At 1 week , 1 , 3 6 month recruitment , subject contact trained interviewer via telephone ass smoking status discus difficulty might encounter . At least 7 call attempt different time make subject consider loss follow-up . Subjects report smoke past 7 day consider self-reported quitter . Self-reported quitter 1 month invite participate biochemical validation include measurement exhale carbon monoxide ( CO ) salivary cotinine level NicAlertÂ® strip ( www.nymox.com ) . The criterion validate abstinence exhale CO &lt; 4 ppm salivary cotinine &lt; 10ng/ml [ 31 , 32 ] . Sample size determination Since RCT test feasibility generate preliminary estimate effectiveness NRT sampling , propose sample size 50 arm ( i.e . total sample size = 100 ) . A similar RCT conduct Jardin et al . ( 2014 ) evaluate effectiveness 2-week free NRT help non-motivated smoker quit smoke chosen power estimation . The result show 3-month quit attempt rate receive free NRT significantly high receive quitline referral ( 32 % vs 16 % , p=0.05 ) . The relative risk ( RR ) therefore determine ( 32 % /16 % = 2.0 ) . Based RR 2.0 , 100 subject , power type I error detect difference use Fisher 's exact test 69.7 % 0.08 . Randomization Sequentially number , opaque seal envelope ( SNOSE ) block randomization use allocate subject two RCT group . The primary investigator prepare 100 identical , opaque , seal , A5-sized envelops . 50 contain eligibility form , education card NRT , action plan intervention group , empty box NRT . The 50 envelops contain eligibility form education card , action plan control group . The ambassador create block 4 envelops , 2 intervention group 2 control , shuffle thoroughly contain separate pile . Recruitment staff use 1 25 pile envelope randomly select 1 envelope intervention . Allocation concealment The group allocation conceal subject ambassador . Subjects aware allocation throughout study . Blinding As assessor outcomes blind group allocation , RCT single-blinded . Data analyse All data enter analyzed SPSS Windows version 20 . The rate quit attempt 7-day abstinence assess t-test odds ratio logistic regression . Both intention-to-treat ( assume miss subject change ) complete case analysis do .
