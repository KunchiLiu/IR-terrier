	<brief_title>Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy ( CLE ) During Medically Induced Neurosurgery Craniobasal Glioma Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient require neurosurgical oncological Intervention use endoscopic device , mini laser probe administer endoscopic device characterize vivo tissue thousandfold magnification cellular level ( so-called optical biopsy ) . Magnification present neurosurgeon time well differentiate healthy pathological tissue . Post-surgery result in-vivo Differentiation compare histocytopathological finding .</detailed_description>
