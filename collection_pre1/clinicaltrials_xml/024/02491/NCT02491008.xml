	<detailed_description>Background Thyroid hormone key regulatory hormone physiological system , include skeleton . Previous study suggest SCTD may associate deleterious skeletal effect . However , controversy persists clinical relevance SCTD well optimal threshold treatment . Available data substantial limitation : 1 ) limit prospective data available assess association SCTD non-cardiovascular outcome , fracture 2 ) lack data large RCTs investigate pathophysiological mechanism association . Objective To examine , within large RCT elderly participant subclinical hypothyroidism ( TRUST trial ) , impact thyroxine therapy association SCTD skeletal fragility , bone mineral density ( BMD ) , bone loss metabolism , risk fracture . Methods The exist trial infrastructure ( TRUST thyroid trial-Euresearch FP7 , clinicaltrials.gov ID : NCT01660126 ) utilize collect biospecimens 145 Swiss participant persistent subclinical hypothyroidism randomize either thyroxine placebo Bern Lausanne . The assessment perform mean dual energy X ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( pqCT ) novel bone imaging technique baseline , 1 year follow-up . In parallel , bone turnover marker blood plasma measure baseline 1 year follow-up .</detailed_description>
