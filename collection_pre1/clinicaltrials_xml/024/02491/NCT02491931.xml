	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Glutamine ( GLN ) abundant free amino acid body , commonly know non-essential amino acid due ability cell produce . It many essential metabolic function organism ; energy substrate cell ( especially enterocytes lymphocyte ) , precursor nucleotide , glutamate , ( particular ) glutathione synthesis , important cellular antioxidant . It play central role nitrogen transport within body , important substrate renal ammoniagenesis . Studies demonstrate presence GLN medium regulate glutamine synthetase expression via post-transcriptional mechanism , rate glutamine synthetase protein degradation diminish activity , augment , presence low GLN concentration . This amino acid modulate immune cell function production cytokine via attenuation multiple pathway inflammation , Nuclear Factor kB ( NF-kB ) , protein kinase , inhibition increase Nitric Oxide Synthase ( iNOS ) expression . It show beneficial metabolically stressed patient , especially critically ill patient . During acute illness , patient experience nutritional depletion , correlate low plasma low mucosal GLN concentration . GLN level significantly decrease critical illness , lead increase infectious complication , organ failure mortality . Moreover , case ischemia/reperfusion injury , GLN increase myocardial ATP/ADP ratio prevents intracellular lactate accumulation . GLN show key nutrient body 's response stress injury describe multiple study vitro vivo myocardial injury follow I/R . These include enhanced myocardial glutathione , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , glutamate ( major stress substrate stress myocardium ) post-I/R injury , induction heat shock protein , especially Heat Shock Protein-70 ( HSP-70 ) critically ill patient . The stress tolerance provide HSP-70 protect cellular injury , lung injury , ischemia/reperfusion injury , septic shock , GLN influence inflammatory response , oxidative stress , apoptosis modulation , integrity gut barrier . Protection myocardium follow ischemia reperfusion injury crucial perioperative management patient cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . This ischemia important factor reversible perioperative risk cardiovascular complication . Patients undergo CPB heart-lung machine ( termed cardiopulmonary bypass ) increase risk abnormal `` inflammation '' body surgery . Such inflammation contribute slow recovery surgery , increase risk infection , increase risk damage organ heart , complicate course . Numerous experimental clinical trial demonstrate cardioprotective effect GLN , include dose-dependent enhance myocardial functional recovery follow acute normothermic ischemia rat . GLN also show reduce infarct size approximately 39 % rabbit model follow ischemia/reperfusion injury . [ 19 ] GLN treatment also increase load tolerance patient ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) . In 2012 , clinical study observe significant decrease TROP-I patient ischemic heart disease underwent CPB extracorporeal circulation receive ( 0.4 g/kg GLN , Dipeptiven solution ) one day surgery . The case group ( n=25 ) show reduced level TROP-I compare control group ( 1.2 ng/ml 2.4 ng/ml ) , p=0.035 first postoperative day . Also , median cardiac index median stroke index high case group follow CPB , improve myocardial function . In another study , author observe significantly decrease TROP-I level pilot-clinical trial . They perform oral intervention patient undergoing CPB , give 25 g twice GLN supplement . TROP-I level significantly low 24 , 48 , 72 postoperatively hour ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Despite varied experimental data show cardioprotective effect GLN , lack clinical trial CPB patient . The find low level cardiac injury marker observe patient treated oral GLN prior CPB major implication patient . The purpose study analyze effect preoperative oral supplementation GLN reduce postoperative level Troponin-I Mexican patient underwent CPB extracorporeal circulation . The oral GLN propose study base previously study consider safe . MATERIALS AND METHODS . A control clinical trial perform 28 patient underwent cardiopulmonary bypass confirm diagnosis ischemic heart disease . The protocol make January 2013 December 2014 Specialty Hospital Western National Medical Center , Mexican Institute Social Security . The protocol receive ethic approval Local Committee Ethics Research Health . All patient give inform consent prior participation . Participants men nonpregnant woman , age 40-70 year . Participants exclude basis preexist kidney , liver dysfunction comorbid condition drug alcohol abuse , positivity human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B / C allergies component GLN . Participants also exclude basis sign ongoing ischemia , define persistent elevation TROP-I CK-MB level . They also exclude diet supplemental GLN . Treatment Following study enrollment , patient randomize ( blinded envelope open sequentially blind study pharmacist ) , receive either oral GLN supplement group control group ( CONT ) maltodextrin ( isocaloric complex carbohydrate ) . All investigator clinical caregiver blind study intervention . All patient GLN group receive GLN supplement . The total GLN/maltodextrin dose give patient standardize 0.5 g/kg/day 3 day prior CPB , take one final dose 0.25 g/kg/day GLN/maltodextrin morning surgery 4 hour prior initiation anesthesia . Compliance ingestion study drug assess via daily reminder call study investigator require empty package return . Patient Sample Collection Analysis Blood collect baseline ( one hour surgery ) , one hour surgery 12 24 postoperative hour . After collection , blood process analysis cardiac injury marker : TROP-I , creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) creatine phosphokinase-Mb ( CPK-Mb ) analyze use Meso Scale technology ( Meso Scale Discovery , Gaithersburg , MD ) . Clinical Data Collection All patient essential demographic information collect well preoperative cardiac ejection fraction study enrollment . In addition , postoperative complication evaluate , include stroke , infection postoperative vasopressor therapy . The time time aortic clamp surgery day Critial Care Unit ( UCI ) measure . Mortality postoperative period also collect . Statistical Analysis Qualitative variable express raw number proportion , whereas quantitative variable express mean Â± standard deviation . To compare quantitative variable result two group , U Mann Whitney test use . Qualitative variable measure use Chi 2 Fisher 's exact test expect value 5 . A p value 0.05 less consider significant . The analysis perform use Excel 2013 Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 20 Windows ( IBM Corp. , NY , USA ) . Ethical Considerations The study conduct accord principle Declaration Helsinki Guidelines Health Research Mexico . The protocol approve Local Committee Health Research .</detailed_description>
