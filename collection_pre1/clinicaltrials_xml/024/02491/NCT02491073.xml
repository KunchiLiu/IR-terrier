	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine blood test use measure free thyroid hormone level affect drug call eslicarbazepine acetate . To determine eslicarbazepine acetate interferes blood test , blood sample analyse researcher compare different type lab test measure thyroid hormone . Half people participate study already take eslicarbazepine acetate either study drug prescription ( Part 1 ) half people take eslicarbazepine acetate ( Part 2 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Serum Free Thyroxine ( FT4 ) Free Triiodothyronine ( FT3 ) Measurements Subjects Treated With Eslicarbazeine Acetate ( ESL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 study enroll minimum 30 male female subject receive least 1200 mg daily ( QD ) ESL minimum 6-week period ( ESL-exposed subject ) . Subjects , meet study eligibility requirement provide write consent , provide blood sample measurement thyroid hormone , thyroxine binding globulin ( TBG ) , serum pregnancy ( female subject childbearing potential 1only ) , thyroid peroxidase ( TPO ) antibody , ESL metabolites ( eslicarbazepine ( R ) -licarbazepine ) . Optional blood sample request subject Part 1 provide genetic consent eligible participate ( control ) separate rash registry protocol . These sample test HLA typing , genetic ancestry , viral titer ( include human herpes virus [ HHV ] -6 , HHV-7 , Epstein-Barr virus [ EBV ] ) . ESL metabolite determine validated liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) assay . Levels FT4 FT3 ESL-exposed serum assay use automated kit assay ( Roche Cobas ECLIA kit FT4 II FT3 III ) Equilibrium Dialysis ( ED ) method . FT4 FT3 result measure method compare evaluate potential assay difference . Serum TSH , TT4 , TT3 , TBG ESL treat subject sample also measure use automated kit assay . Part 2 study enroll minimum 30 age ( ± 5 ) gender-matched non-ESL exposed volunteer . Subjects , meet study eligibility requirement provide write consent , provide blood sample measurement thyroid hormone , TBG , serum pregnancy ( female subject childbearing potential ) , TPO antibody . Serum sample obtain non-ESL exposed subject split 4 aliquot , one aliquot use control blank ( unspiked ) rest spike 3 level ( high , low , concentration representative therapeutic level also call middle ) eslicarbazepine ( range approximately 5 18 μg/mL ) ( R ) -licarbazepine ( range approximately 0.5 1.8 μg/mL ) . The low concentration spike non-ESL exposed sample approximately 1 standard deviation ( SD ) Cavg associate 800 mg dose chronic use epilepsy population high concentration spike approximately 1 SD Cavg associate 1200 mg dose . After sample spike eslicarbazepine ( R ) -licarbazepine , serum FT4 FT3 measure automated kit assay method , well ED method . FT4 FT3 measure non-spiked spiked volunteer sample compare detect potential vitro artifact . Serum TSH , TT4 , TT3 , TBG non-spiked spike volunteer sample also measure use automated kit assay .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>ESLexposed Subjects 1 . Subject must give write informed consent privacy authorization prior participation study . 2 . Male female patient ( ≥ 18 year age ) receive least 1200 mg QD ESL least 6 week experience rash allergic reaction time blood draw . NonESLexposed Subjects 1 . Subject must give write informed consent privacy authorization prior participation study . 2 . Male female healthy normal volunteer ( ≥ 18 year age ) . Both ESLexposed nonESL expose subject 1 . Subject tolerate venipuncture Has poor venous access would cause difficulty collect blood sample . 2 . Subject history thyroid disease clinical condition ( eg , renal insufficiency , Sjogren 's syndrome , lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , pernicious anemia etc . ) opinion Investigator may effect level thyroid hormone , TBG , and/or TPO antibody . 3 . Female subject pregnant . 4 . Female subject positive urine pregnancy test screening . 5 . Subject receive excluded medication least 30 day prior blood draw . 6 . Subject experience significant blood loss and/or donate blood within last 60 day blood draw . 7 . Subject intend donate blood undergo elective surgery within next 30 day follow blood draw . 8 . Subject donate plasma within last 72 hour blood draw intend donate plasma study participation . 9 . Subject , opinion Investigator , unsuitable way participate study .</criteria>
