	<brief_title>Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation Prosthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The core ITAP™ design comprise three discrete section , proximal section , intramedullary stem secure medullary canal , soft tissue integration flange transcutaneous component pass skin . The device design surgically implanted one stage procedure . In great detail : Intra-medullary stem - component design match natural shape canal design use principle establish used fixation massive endo-prosthetic replacement . In certain case hydroxyapatite ceramic ( CaPO4 ) coating use , provide enhance uncemented fixation . In case , depend geometry intramedullary canal , stem fixed place use acrylic bone cement .</detailed_description>
