	<brief_summary>Some subtypes gastric cardia tumor adenocarcinoma gastric linitis disseminate cell respond poorly pre-operative chemotherapy , respond chemotherapy usually perform . Doing chemotherapy patient could delay surgical management . The completion chemotherapy patient would bad prognosis factor accord recent data literature . Therefore , aim research find prognostic marker sensitivity chemotherapy usually perform . The investigator go use biopsy realize diagnosis select patient `` good bad '' responder . Primary purpose : To study cardia gastric tumor , molecular marker sensitivity pre- post- perative chemotherapy protocol ( EOX protocol ... FOLFOX ) chemoradiation Secondary purpose : - To assess impact patient ' lifestyle ( via questionnaire ) response chemotherapy - To study marker cancer stem cell - To correlate clinical molecular marker patient survival quality life questionnaires - To characterize expression level ( Met , Her2 , FGFR2 ) mutation ( p53 ra ) frequently deregulate gene gastric cancer . - To characterize level expression predictive candidate marker ( ΔNp73 , TAp73 , HDAC4 , mir140 , EZH2 , CXCL12 , CXCR4 , CXCR7 ) find literature . - To correlate abnormality find tumor stage ( chemotherapy ) 5 year overall survival progression-free patient</brief_summary>
