	<brief_title>The Form Dairy Products Satiety , Food Intake Post-meal Glycaemia Normal Weight Overweight/Obese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last 30 year , overweight obesity become characteristic majority Canadians . Approximately 60 % adult Canada overweight obese . The Canadian Health Measures Survey , conduct 2007-2009 , estimate prevalence metabolic syndrome 19.1 % adult population . In addition , accord 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey , 18.1 % Canadian adult report obese . Along health burden , also bring estimate economic burden $ 4.3 billion annually 2001 , likely double today . Metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes occur concurrently insulin resistance mark increase blood glucose level fast postprandial , glycosylated blood protein lead arterial damage , inflammation comorbidities cardiovascular disease . Despite increased consumer interest consume food may help treat prevent obesity diabetes , effective countermeasure metabolic diseases yet establish . Thus , food product capable control parameter metabolic disease include blood glucose , insulin level food intake urgent need investigation identification . Dairy product believe hold potential functional physiological property . There many observational long-term clinical study show regular consumption dairy product correlate good body composition low incidence obesity type 2 diabetes . Studies also find dairy protein satiate type protein , effective lower increase glycemic response high GI food intake , study do isolated protein . Hence , role dairy protein , conventional food form reflect usual intake , food intake glycemia interaction metabolic disease interest . From short-term study do lab , investigator show dairy product bring benefit glycemic control food intake consume within ad libitum meal , achieve insulin dependent independent mechanism . The investigator show fluid milk product yogurt improve post-meal glycemic excursion consume within ad libitum meal healthy young adult . Except yogurt study conduct lab , study report role solid semi-solid dairy product consume meal , within meal , immediately post-meal meal snack glycemia appetite control . Our study yogurt show yogurt , especially high protein carbohydrate ratio , reduce pre-meal glucose incremental area curve . Further study solid semi-solid dairy need conduct milk , like caloric beverage , lead calorie accumulation consume meal even though provide nutrient , lower post-meal blood glucose excursion lead great post-meal satiety young adult . Moreover , evidence appear relatively consistent respect beneficial role low-fat dairy product prevention type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , however , role regular/high-fat dairy less clear . A number cross-sectional prospective epidemiological study identify positive association intake dietary fat risk development either insulin resistance T2D20 . More research need well understand role regular-fat dairy product food intake well glycemic control . The propose study investigate effect pre-meal regular fat ; cheese , yogurt milk satiety , food intake glycemia normal weight overweight/obese young adult ( 20-30yrs ) .</detailed_description>
