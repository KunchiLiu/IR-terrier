	<brief_summary>A study investigate inhale Interferon beta-1a safe tolerate , prevent reduce severity asthma attack administer asthma patient onset symptom common cold influenza</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Asthma Patients Evaluate Efficacy , Safety Tolerability 14 Days Once Daily Inhaled Interferon Beta-1a After Onset Symptoms Upper Respiratory Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist Pre-Treatment Phase follow Treatment Phase . Patients screen enter Pre-Treatment phase remain develop symptom common cold flu . During Pre-Treatment Phase patient ask daily think common cold flu . When patient answer yes question he/she come common cold flu , arrangement make evaluate patient study site , eligible , enters Treatment Phase . Baseline assessment perform patient randomize 1:1 receive 24 μg ( meter dose ) inhale Interferon beta-1a placebo daily 14 day ( deliver I-neb® device [ Philips Respironics ] ) . Treatment start soon possible later 48 hour onset first common cold flu symptom . Patients assess regard exacerbation change respiratory symptom reliever medication use home use ePRO device . Lung function measure home patient study site . There five clinical visit Treatment Phase two visit end treatment ; efficacy safety monitor 2-3 week end treatment final follow-up visit take place . The study population comprise adult asthmatic patient maintenance treatment medium high dose inhale corticosteroid second controller medication ( eg , long- act β2 agonist ) , documented history least two severe exacerbation within last 24 month , least one occur last 12 month , suspect patient aforementioned exacerbation trigger upper respiratory tract infection ( ie , related symptom common cold flu ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For inclusion study patient fulfil follow criterion : 1 . Provision sign date write informed consent prior study specific procedures 2 . Male female age 18 time enrolment 3 . History physiciandiagnosed asthma require treatment mediumtohigh dose ICS ( &gt; 250 μg fluticasone dry powder formulation equivalent total daily dose , define GINA 2014 , see CSP Appendix G ) , second controller medication recommend GINA guideline ( ie , LABA , leukotriene receptor antagonist sustain release theophylline ) . The medium high dose ICS plus LABA combination inhaler 2 separate inhaler . Patients must take ICS ( &gt; 250 μg fluticasone equivalent daily ) plus second controller medication least 12 month prior date informed consent obtain , without another controller oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) , theophylline , tiotropium , leukotriene receptor antagonist . The maintenance treatment must keep high level last 12 month . 4 .

If historical documentation available , reversibility proof positive response methacholine , histamine mannitol challenge must demonstrate documented Visit 1 5 . Must answer `` Yes '' question `` Does cold flu make asthma bad ? '' 6 . To least two document severe asthma exacerbation within last 24 month suspect patient cause common cold flu To least one document severe asthma exacerbation within last 12 month suspect patient cause common cold flu 7 .
