	<detailed_description>A prospective , multicenter trial design confirm safety effectiveness Lotus Valve System Japanese medical environment consistent REPRISE III result TAVR symptomatic subject calcific , severe native aortic stenosis extreme high risk surgical valve replacement .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Aortic Valve Stenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>IC1 . Subject document calcific , severe native aortic stenosis initial AVA ≤1.0 cm2 ( AVA index ≤0.6 cm2/m2 ) mean pressure gradient ≥40 mm Hg jet velocity ≥4.0 m/s , measure echocardiography and/or invasive hemodynamics . IC2 . Subject document aortic annulus size ≥18 mm ≤27 mm base Center 's assessment preprocedure diagnostic imaging ( confirmed Case Review Committee [ CRC ] ) deem treatable available size test device IC3 . Subject symptomatic aortic valve stenosis NYHA Functional Class ≥ II IC4 . There agreement heart team ( must include site investigator interventionalist site investigator cardiac surgeon ) subject high extreme operative risk surgical valve replacement ( see note definition extreme high risk , require level surgical assessment , CRC confirmation ) TAVR appropriate . Additionally , subject least one follow . Society Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) score ≥8 % OR If STS &lt; 8 , subject least one follow condition : Hostile chest Porcelain aorta Severe pulmonary hypertension ( &gt; 60 mmHg ) Prior chest radiation therapy Coronary artery bypass graft ( ) risk reoperation Severe lung disease ( need supplemental oxygen , FEV1 &lt; 50 % predict , DLCO &lt; 60 % , evidence severe pulmonary dysfunction ) Neuromuscular disease create risk mechanical ventilation rehabilitation surgical aortic valve replacement Orthopedic disease create risk rehabilitation surgical aortic valve replacement Childs Class A B liver disease ( subject Childs Class C disease eligible inclusion trial ) Frailty indicate least one following : 5‑meter walk &gt; 6 second , Katz ADL score 3/6 less , body mass index &lt; 21 , wheelchair bound , unable live independently Age ≥90 year Other evidence subject high extreme risk surgical valve replacement ( CRC must confirm agreement site heart team subject meet high extreme risk definition ) IC5 . Heart team ( must include cardiac interventionalist experience cardiac surgeon ) assessment subject likely benefit valve replacement . IC6 . Subject ( legal representative ) understand study requirement treatment procedure , provide write informed consent . IC7 . Subject , family member , and/or legal representative agree ( ) subject capable return study hospital require schedule follow visit . IC8 . Subject must least 20 year old . IC9 . For subject suitable iliofemoral access ( caliber iliofemoral vessel , severe tortuosity factor prevent safe iliofemoral access ) , transaortic access deem appropriate heart team confirm CRC . This inclusion criterion applicable TAo substudy 21mm substudy transaortic approach use . Note : Extreme operative risk high operative risk define follow : Extreme Operative Risk : Predicted operative mortality serious , irreversible morbidity risk ≥50 % 30 day . High Operative Risk : Predicted operative mortality serious , irreversible morbidity risk ≥15 % 30 day . EC1 . Subject congenital unicuspid bicuspid aortic valve . EC2 . Subject acute myocardial infarction within 30 day prior index procedure ( define Qwave MI nonQwave MI total CK elevation ≥ twice normal presence CKMB elevation and/or troponin elevation ) . EC3 . Subject cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within past 6 month prior study enrollment . EC4 . Subject endstage renal disease eGFR &lt; 20 . Note : eGFR ( ml/min/1.73m2 ) =194×Cr1.094×Age0.287× ( If female×0.739 ) EC5 . Subject preexist prosthetic aortic mitral valve . EC6 . Subject severe aortic , tricuspid , mitral regurgitation . EC7 . Subject need emergency surgery reason . EC8 . Subject history endocarditis within 6 month index procedure evidence active systemic infection sepsis . EC9 . Subject echocardiographic evidence new intracardiac vegetation intraventricular paravalvular thrombus require intervention . EC10 . Subject Hgb &lt; 9 g/dL , platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/mm3 &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3 , white blood cell count &lt; 1,000 cells/mm3 . EC11 . Subject require chronic anticoagulation therapy implant procedure treat warfarin ( anticoagulant permit first month ) least 1 month concomitant either aspirin P2Y12 inhibitor ( clopidogrel ticlopidine , prasugrel allow ) . EC12 . Subject gastrointestinal bleed require hospitalization transfusion within past 3 month , clinically significant bleed diathesis coagulopathy would preclude treatment require antiplatelet regimen , refuse transfusion . EC13 . Subject known hypersensitivity contrast agent adequately premedicated , know hypersensitivity aspirin , P2Y12 inhibitor , heparin , nickel , tantalum , titanium , polyurethane . EC14 . Subject life expectancy le 12 month due noncardiac , comorbid condition base assessment investigator time enrollment . EC15 . Subject hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy . EC16 . Subject therapeutic invasive cardiac vascular procedure within 30 day prior index procedure ( except balloon aortic valvuloplasty pacemaker implantation , allow ) . EC17 . Subject untreated coronary artery disease , opinion treat physician clinically significant require revascularization . EC18 . Subject severe leave ventricular dysfunction ejection fraction &lt; 20 % . EC19 . Subject cardiogenic shock hemodynamic instability require inotropic support mechanical support device . EC20 . Subject severe vascular disease would preclude safe access ( e.g. , aneurysm thrombus cross safely , mark tortuosity , significant narrowing abdominal aorta , severe unfold thoracic aorta , symptomatic carotid vertebral disease ) . This exclusion criterion applicable TF study 21mm substudy transfemoral transiliac approach use . EC21 . Subject thick ( &gt; 5 mm ) protruding ulcerated atheroma aortic arch .
