	<brief_summary>This pilot trial study well dexamethasone re-treatment enzalutamide work treat patient prostate cancer spread place body ( metastatic ) , respond hormone therapy ( hormone-resistant ) , previously treat enzalutamide docetaxel . Dexamethasone treatment may able reverse one resistance mechanism enzalutamide therapy ( overabundance receptor dexamethasone glucocorticoid inside cancer cell ) allow renew therapeutic sensitivity enzalutamide . Androgens ( type male hormone ) bind androgen receptor find inside prostate cancer cell , may cause cancer cell grow . Enzalutamide may stop growth prostate cancer cell block activity cancer cell androgen receptor . Giving dexamethasone prior re-treatment enzalutamide may treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Prior Re-treatment With Enzalutamide Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Enzalutamide Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate enzalutamide ( Enza ) treatment dexamethasone ( Dex ) therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Objective response rate Enza patient measurable disease compute tomography ( CT ) scan use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . II . Time PSA progression ( base upon Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 [ PCWG2 ] criterion ) treatment Dex . III . Effect treatment quality life assess patient completion validate instrument ( Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy [ FACIT ] -Fatigue Scale , RAND Short Form-36 [ RANDSF-36 ] ) . IV . PSA response rate Dex patient androgen receptor splice variant 7 ( AR-V7 ) positive AR-V7 negative , respectively , study entry . V. Response rate Enza patient AR-V7 positive AR-V7 negative , respectively , study entry . VI . Percentage patient AR-V7 positive study entry AR-V7 negative time initiation Enza , vice-versa . OUTLINE : Patients receive dexamethasone orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity evidence PSA progression , clinical disease progression , radiographic disease progression . At time progression , dexamethasone stop via rapid taper one week patient treat 30 day . Patients receive enzalutamide PO daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence clinical disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
