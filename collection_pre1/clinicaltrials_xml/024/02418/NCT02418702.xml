This study show favorable evidence support investigation use single sub-anesthetic bolus dose ketamine acutely depress and/or suicidal patient emergency room set .

Data collection highly flaw , unpublished , preliminary result show ketamine treatment result significant decreased suicidal think . Of note , adverse event associate ketamine administration . Although infusion do Emergency Department ( ED ) setting , patient seat clinic chair , require additional monitoring intervention beyond could provide clinic psychiatric hospital setting . It intent project expand unfunded trial , allow u treat wider range participant come psychiatric ward suicidal thinking . This study pursue context exist therapy major depression lag onset action several week , result increase risk possible considerable morbidity possibly mortality suicide . This study would explore efficacy Ketamine 's ( N-Methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist ) rapid potentially long-lasting antidepressant effect suicidal population . The Investigators hope gather data could potentially impact treatment practice military set acutely depressed patient .
