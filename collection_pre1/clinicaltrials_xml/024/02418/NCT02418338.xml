	<brief_title>2D Strain Evaluation : Children With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Versus Healthy Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among new echocardiographic technique , two dimensional Speckle Tracking Imaging `` 2D Strain '' allow dynamic study regionalized global ventricular contraction . With software spatial temporal process standard 2D image , technique measure displacement natural marker present myocardial wall . Used adult cardiology since 2000 , could eligible pediatric population many potential application . In Duchenne muscular dystrophy , myocardial disease lead death third decade . Early diagnosis preventive therapy remain challenge . No clinic , biologic radiologic marker predict myocardial disease advance irreversible heart failure . Recent animal human study suggest 2D strain anomaly could predict leave ventricular systolic dysfunction Duchenne muscular dystrophy . If confirm , 2D strain could use early marker myocardial disease routine patient follow-up future therapeutic study . Purpose : - To compare systolic function leave ventricle ( LV ) right ventricle ( RV ) 2D strain evaluation Duchenne muscular dystrophy child versus control group . - To correlate 2D Strain variable conventional LV RV echo variable . - To evaluate 2D strain feasibility normal child Duchenne muscular myopathy population</detailed_description>
