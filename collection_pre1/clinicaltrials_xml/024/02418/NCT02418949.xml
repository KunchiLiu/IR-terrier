	<detailed_description>In four arm parallel design randomly assign one 4 group : Group 1 ) cyproheptadine active movement therapy , Group 2 ) placebo active movement therapy , Group 3 ) cyproheptadine passive stretching , Group 4 ) placebo passive stretching . The group blind neither research staff ( even study doctor ) know drug ( Cyproheptadine placebo ) receive . Only RIC pharmacist access information participant complete entire study . Although research staff administer training session know assign active movement practice ( AMP ) passive cyclical stretch group , important discus information rater ( evaluator ) study doctor . Cyproheptadine anti-serotonergic anti spastic agent . It expect reduce unwanted muscle hyper excitability ( one measure spasticity ) common stroke . During course treatment require make several visit per week RIC either evaluate participate treatment session . Evaluations last approximately 2 hour perform begin week 1 , 2 , 3 4 , middle treatment ( begin week 7 ) , end training ( begin week 10 ) well final follow-up visit one month end treatment ( begin week 14 ) . The training session occur week 4 week 9 involve 1.5-hr . session ( 1 hr training plus setup time ) 3 time per week . The investigator hypothesize group receiving combine cyproheptadine active movement therapy well outcomes group receive cyproheptadine active movement therapy alone .</detailed_description>
