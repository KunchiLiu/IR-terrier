	<brief_summary>Obesity complex multifactorial disease genetics play important role predispose child early onset obesity . Though many obesity susceptible gene variant identify obesity , common obesity gene , MC4R account 5 % early onset obesity case . This implies may obesity relate gene variant need unravelled delineate relationship obesity genetics . The investigator propose screen exonic region gene obese subject use whole-exome sequencing ( WES ) discover novel obesity relate variant gene . Primary hypothesis The investigator hypothesize paediatric subject early-onset severe obesity strong genetic predisposition therefore cohort would enrich obesity susceptibility genetic variant . Secondary hypothesis The investigator hypothesize increase prevalence , possibly worsen , obesity-related complication ( namely glucose intolerance , hypertension , metabolic syndrome , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ) severely obese child , compare 15 year ago , due increasingly obesogenic environment promote unhealthy lifestyle eat habit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Number subject enrol : As study aim identify susceptible genetic variant associate early onset obesity , recruit 400 obese child participate genetic study , addition exist DNA sample collect previous study ( DSRB Ref C/00/501 ) . These 400 obese child recruit NUH paediatric clinic School Health Clinic Health Promotion Board . We also recruit family member obese child interested join research study . We use DNA sample information 250 obese child previously recruit Obesity Genetic Study January 2000 December 2004 ( DSRB Ref C/00/501 ) . We also perform WES 500 lean adult ( control ) recruit ongoing study title `` Whole exome sequence identify gene extreme Myopia Asian population '' ( NUS-IRB reference code : 12-466 ) . Total number new obese child subject recruit : 400 Total number family member ( Parents sibling ) : 500 Total number exist obese child subject use : 250 Total number exist lean adult control use : 500 Criteria Recruitment : The doctor ask simple question regard age medical history subject . For obese subject : Overweight 10 year age , body weight 40 % ideal body weight height , BMI age 97th percentile without major medical illness . For family member : Parents direct sibling obese child ( selection criterion ) For control : Lean adult ongoing study ( NUS-IRB reference code : 12-466 ) BMI 18.5 kg/m2 23 kg/m2 Inclusion Criteria : The obese subject must meet follow inclusion criterion participate study : 1 . Ideal body weight height ( WFH ) least 140 % BMI age 97th percentile 2 . Overweight 10 year age 3 . Informed consent obese child subject legal representative e.g . parent Family member must meet follow inclusion criterion participate study : 1 . Must parent direct sibling obese subject 2 . Informed consent subject parent subject 21 year age Exclusion Criteria : All subject meet exclusion criterion baseline exclude participation : 1 . Unfit blood test OGTT test 2 . No informed consent Withdrawal Criteria : The study may discontinue : - No OSHE approval - No DSRB approval - Complaints inappropriate procedure perform subject - Laboratory toxicity Study Visits Procedures : 1 . Screening Visits Procedures The subject screen school health clinic HPB NUH paediatric clinic . The subject 's age , weight height take . Only doctor determine ideal body weight height great 140 % BMI age great 97th percentile local child population invite study . The subject allow go home consent form reply within 3 month recruitment . 2 . Study Visits Procedures Study visit 1 : Trained doctor carry interview regard medical history subject perform physical examination . 15ml blood drawn subject ( overnight fasting ) test liver panel , lipid panel , fast insulin level , fast C-peptide level . The subject also go oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) 2ml blood drawn 0 min 120min time-interval OGTT . During 2 hr OGTT , subject require fill 3 set questionnaire regard motivational level , socio-economic status physical activity diet . The family member obese subject require go test describe subject except need undergo OGTT . 3 . Final Study Visit : The final study visit schedule 2-3 week first visit . The screen report subject review evaluate attend doctor subject . 4 . Post Study Follow Procedures The subject able keep copy health screen test report . For subject find suffer medical condition dyslipidemia , high blood pressure , high body fat percentage , liver malfunction glucose intolerance , refer department test medical attention confirm outcome measure . Subjects find rare genetic variant genetic testing also call back repeat clinical examination test . 5 . Discontinuation Visit Procedures Subjects may withdraw voluntarily participation study time . The biological sample subject discard upon request subject . However , patient find suffer complication study health screening , advise referred department medical treatment . Data Quality Assurance : The electronic input patient ' data system handle 2 research coordinator perform data entry independently . Thus , data subject enter twice system 2 independent research coordinator . We system comparison 2 entry per subject ensure information subject enter correctly accurately . The principal investigator also randomly check system every month data quality assurance . Data Entry Storage : The clinical testing data questionnaire enter subject paper . The paper documentation transfer transport back PI 's office subject 's data enter electronically 2 independent research coordinator ensure data quality assurance . All electronic entry documentation perform within office use office computer paper documentation must return lock-up end day . The electronic documentation password protect hard copy paper documentation store lock key access cabinet PI 's office . Briefly discuss data enter ( i.e . entry paper electronically ) , store handle . Determination Sample Size : Power calculation carry use Quanto ( ver 1.2.4 ) . To detect variant power odd ratio 2.0-5.0 discovery stage vary MAF ( α=0.01 ) , sample size 400 obese child approximately 51 % 98 % power detect variant large effect ( OR = 3.5 ) discovery stage , MAF 0.5 % 3.0 % , respectively ( α=0.01 ) . Statistical Analytical Plans : All prioritize damaging non-synonymous variant test statistical association case-control design use SPSS . The 2-tailed Fisher 's exact test utilized variant MAF &lt; 3 % logistic regression , adjust sex perform variant MAF ≥ 3 % . These do use PLINK . We also carry gene-level burden test use Sequencing Kernel Association Test ( SKAT ) software . All single-variant gene-level result correct multiple test use Bonferonni correction . Any variant identify prediction tool ( Polyphen2 ) highly disruptive ( defined nonsense , splice site frameshift change , severely disrupt protein structure ) prioritize validation . Statistical analysis de novo genotyping data similar primary aim 1 . Subsequently , meta-analyse data discovery validation stage use inverse variance-weighted method , assume fixed-effect model , derive overall pool estimate two-sided p-values . Heterogeneity check conduct ( Cochran 's Q I2 index ) , variant significant ( Q p-value &lt; 0.05 and/or I2 index &gt; 40 % ) heterogeneity detect meta-analysis carried random effect mode well . RETENTION OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS : The record participant include medical history , clinical report , blood test result , questionnaire , OSHE documentation , IRB documentation DSRB documentation keep principal investigator lock-up cabinet card access office . Only principal investigator hold key direct access lock-up cabinet . These document retain period 6years end research study . For Principal Investigator initiate Trials : All serious adverse event ( SAEs ) unexpected related study drug must report HSA . `` A serious adverse event serious adverse drug reaction untoward medical occurrence dose : - Results death . - Is life-threatening ( immediate risk death ) . - Requires inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization . - Results persistent significant disability/incapacity . - Results congenital anomaly/birth defect . - Is Medically important event . Medical scientific judgment exercise determine whether event important medical event . An important medical event may immediately life threaten and/or result death hospitalization . However , determine event may jeopardize subject and/or may require intervention prevent one adverse event outcome , important medical event report serious . '' All SAEs unexpected related study drug report . The investigator responsible inform HSA later 15 calendar day first knowledge case qualifies expedite report . Follow-information actively seek submit becomes available . For fatal life-threatening case , HSA notify soon possible later 7 calendar day first knowledge case qualifies , follow complete report within 8 additional calendar day .</detailed_description>
