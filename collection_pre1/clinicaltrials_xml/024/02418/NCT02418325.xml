Secondary objective : Assessment efficacy baseline , prior discharge , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 12 month treatment base following : EDSS 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale ( MSIS-29 ) , MS Functional Composite ( MSFC ) consist ( 1 ) Timed 25-Foot Walk , ( 2 ) 9 Hole Peg Test , ( 3 ) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Allogeneic Human UC-MSC Liberation Therapy ( When Associated With CCSVI ) Patients With RRMS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY TREATMENT : Investigational therapy product : Wharton Jelly derive allogeneic MSCs . Method administration dose : Super selective intravenous administration 50 million Allogeneic Human Umbilical Cord Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( UC-MSC ) intrathecal administration UC-MSCs dose 100 million along liberation therapy ( associate CCSVI ) . SAFETY AND EFFICACY EVALUATION : The propose study ass safety primary secondary efficacy endpoint super selective intravenous intrathecal administration allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell ( UC-MSC ) 69 patient Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis . Safety Evaluation : Assessment treatment safety base incidence treatment emergent/treatment associate adverse event prior discharge 1 , 3 , 6 12 month post treatment . Efficacy evaluation : Clinical evaluation , include EDSS 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale ( MSIS-29 ) perform baseline stem cell mobilization , prior discharge 1 , 3 , 6 12 month stem cell therapy . The MS Functional Composite ( MSFC ) consist ( ) Timed 25-Foot Walk , ( b ) 9 Hole Peg Test , ( c ) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test perform baseline stem cell mobilization 12 month stem cell therapy . Gadolinium enhance MRI scan brain perform baseline therapy 12 month stem cell therapy . Follow-up scan perform type scanner use baseline . Scans analyze centrally . The 'baseline MRI scan ' reference brain volume change . DATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Descriptive analysis adverse event perform . Proportion adverse event visit calculate use frequency distribution . The frequency , severity , time potential relationship intervention assess order characterize safety intervention . The probability overall event-free survival ( well progression-free , relapse-free , MRI event-free survival ) baseline 1 year calculate . The end point progression define increase Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score great 0.5 baseline . Analyses conduct use Kaplan-Meier estimate Wald-type 90 % CIs base Greenwood 's formula SE . Descriptive analyse primary secondary efficacy endpoint perform use descriptive statistic . Proportion patient clinically significant change efficacy measurement scale ( EDSS , MSIS , MSFC , MSFC-25 foot walk test , MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test , MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ) change gadolinium enhance lesion , new T2 lesion previous visit present proportion . The percentage change brain volume calculate screen analyzed end point status month 12 exact Wilcoxon rank sum test use mean score result identical.The null hypothesis test whether median percentage change brain volume among participant meet endpoint month 12 equal median meet end point month 12 . Other primary secondary efficacy endpoint ( EDSS , MSIS , MSFC , MSFC-25 foot walk test , MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test , MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ) analyze use Wilcoxon sign rank test . Change baseline outcomes endpoint calculate patient underwent stem cell transplant post transplant value minus baseline value . The null hypothesis test whether median difference baseline measurement value month 1 , month 3 , month 6 month 12 visit significantly different zero , baseline measurement define screen assessment percentage change brain volume baseline visit end point . To calculate MSFC , result 3 component transform z score average yield composite patient timepoint . The z score compose MSFC score calculate use reference population National Multiple Sclerosis Society Task Force database .</detailed_description>
