	<brief_summary>Recent evidence show dietary supplementation resistant starch ( RS ) increase fat catabolism rest energy expenditure decrease plasma insulin glucose response well gut-derived hormone , glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) . Consumption whey protein also show increase energy expenditure favorably affect gut hormone . Thus , investigator test consumption RS whey protein energy expenditure gut hormone lean obese woman men .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consumed separately , resistant starch ( RS ) whey protein ( WP ) favorably affect energy metabolism gut hormone , well suppress feeling hunger . These finding important release certain gut hormone ( i.e. , GIP ) associate low rest energy expenditure ( REE ) healthy human . Interestingly , recent study show ingestion RS reduce postprandial GIP increase postprandial REE fat utilization healthy men therefore may effective strategy weight management . Thus , need replicate finding healthy cohort lean obese woman men . The purpose study examine effect RS number calorie burn eat meal , well specific hormone release stomach intestine follow meal ingestion healthy lean obese woman men . Investigators use single ingestion meal supplement without resistant starch whey protein .</detailed_description>
