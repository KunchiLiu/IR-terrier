	<detailed_description>Traditional DBS perform without general anesthesia patient awake . Local anesthetic use numb skin tissue incision make , patient give mild sedative alleviate anxiety discomfort . Essential tremor ( ET ) patient undergo intra-operative test stimulation refine lead location ensure absence sustain side effect . This result multiple brain penetration lead placement , entire procedure may last anywhere 4-6 hour average . The concept awake brain surgery provoke significant anxiety fear patient . Recently , increase interest perform DBS general anesthesia , stimulate target locate anatomically ( i.e . MRI ) rather physiologically via microelectrode recording intra-operative test stimulation . This technology term `` asleep '' DBS perform patient general anesthesia . Intraoperative image utilized verify stereotactic accuracy DBS electrodes placement time surgery . Because stereotactic accuracy ( surgical safety ) surgical endpoint , need patient awake procedure . If asleep DBS produce clinical result equivalent awake DBS surgery , possible advantage include short surgical time , improve patient comfort , good access DBS patient , cost saving hospital . To date ( August 2011 - September 2014 ) , 157 patient undergone asleep DBS surgery 141 patient undergone traditional awake DBS surgery . ET patient constitute 76 total surgery - 50 patient underwent awake surgery 26 underwent asleep surgery . The safety efficacy two approach DBS surgery equivalent , position equipoise regard offer patient . To date , randomize , control clinical trial compare efficacy functional outcome two DBS method patient diagnosis Essential tremor . The purpose propose study demonstrate functional outcome `` asleep '' technique inferior report traditional `` awake '' DBS technique . The primary data point study include three month functional outcome use accept outcome metric ET , include objective tremor rating scale ( Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale ) , tremor Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) questionnaire ( Bain Findley Tremor ADL scale ) , tremor quality life questionnaire : Quality Life Essential Tremor Questionnaire [ QUEST ] ) . Parkinson Meter Life Pulse tremor reading ( two iPhone accelerometer application ) also collect . . Patients elect participate trial undergo routine pre-operative neurocognitive evaluation consist follow routine evaluative test : Wechsler Test Adult Reading , Mattis Dementia Rating Scale 2nd Edition , Wechsler Abbreviate Scale Intelligence 2nd Edition ; Wechsler Memory Scale 3rd edition , Digit Span , Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test , Trail Making Test , Wisconsin Card Sorting Test , Controlled Oral Word Association Test , Animal Naming , Boston Naming Test , Wechsler Memory Scale 4th Edition , Logical Memory , Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised , Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised , Hooper visual Organization Test , Judgment Line Orientation , Beck Depression Inventory , Beck Anxiety Inventory , Epworth Sleepiness Scale . The subject randomize 2 group use random number envelope system . We anticipate 120 total patient need enrol pilot study ( 60 awake , 60 asleep ) , thus number 1-120 placed envelope . An odd number correspond awake DBS procedure , even number indicate asleep DBS procedure . The null hypothesis asleep DBS result inferior tremor rating 3-months surgery compare awake DBS . Our secondary aim evaluate cognitive change associate DBS surgery selection ( awake vs. asleep ) ET patient . Current standard care patient selection DBS focus primarily evaluation motor symptom currently guidance patient ' DBS surgery selection ( awake vs. asleep ) would impact subsequent neurocognitive function .</detailed_description>
