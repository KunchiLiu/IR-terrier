	<brief_title>Fluid Responsiveness Postoperative Patient : Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative care Preoperative Period As per usual practice , patient 's staff surgeon provide directive preoperative fast fluid intake . These patient encourage drink two hour hospital admission , also receive preoperative carbohydrate drink night ( 100 gram ) , morning surgery ( 50 gram ) indicate . Additionally , routine use mechanical bowel preparation avoid , prescribe select case . The patient 's weight obtain upon arrival operating room . Anesthetic analgesic management Anesthetic management choice postoperative analgesia per usual care , discretion staff anesthesiologist in-charge case . An arterial line central venous line may insert , Goal Directed Fluid Therapy ( GDFT ) employ deem necessary . Post-anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) On arrival PACU , basic hemodynamic parameter , include heart rate ( HR ) , blood pressure ( BP ) , oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , temperature , central venous pressure ( CVP ) , available , record accord standardize PACU protocol . A research assistant collect initial PACU value hemodynamic variable . Surgical time , estimate surgical blood loss , urine output , intraoperative fluid blood product administration also record . PACU care dictate treat staff anesthesiologist . Patients discharge PACU accord standard institutional criterion . Surgical floor Postoperative care management , include commencement oral diet fluid management , discretion surgical team . If require , VE ( volume solution infuse type intravenous solution ) decide case case surgical team . The patient 's weight obtain daily hospital discharge . Patients typically discharge afebrile , able tolerate oral diet , pain control ( numeric rating scale ( NRS ) &lt; 4 ) , able ambulate . Assessment FR A research assistant work department Anesthesia ass FR two occasion : 1 . When VE order treat team , either PACU surgical floor upon standard evaluation hemodynamic parameter , urine output , surgical loss , laboratory test abnormality . FR assess measure SV Cardiac Output ( CO ) obtain ccNexfin system 1 5 minute VE . A patient consider fluid responder SV increase least 15 % 1 minute VE . A cut-off 15 % chosen represent minimal clinical significant difference two CO measurement obtain thermodilution . 2 . Upon arrival PACU , every day breakfast hospital stay . FR assess measure SV CO obtain ccNexfin system 1 minute follow 250 ml Lactated Ringer 's give fluid challenge . A patient consider fluid responder SV increase least 15 % fluid challenge . Prediction FR A fluid challenge 250 ml Lactated Ringer 's use predict FR administration VE order treat team , either PACU surgical floor upon standard evaluation hemodynamic parameter , urine output , surgical loss , laboratory test abnormality . A patient consider fluid responder SV increase least 15 % 1 min end fluid challenge The utilization fluid challenge show high-accuracy ( Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve &gt; 0.9 ) predict FR spontaneously breathe patients47 . Furthermore , administration fluid challenge predict FR already describe several trial , include sick patient populations48 ( ICU patient , patient undergo major surgery , patient Ejection Fraction ( EF ) &lt; 40 % ) . Measurement FR 1 . Assessment FR VE deem necessary treating physician PACU surgical floor Prior administration non-emergent fluid bolus ( VE ) order treat physician , nurse additionally page research assistant measure ccNexfin CO-Trek parameter describe earlier , administer fluid challenge measure FR . For simplicity , single pager number use , affixed front chart patient include study . A copy study protocol also give nurse PACU surgical floor perusal . The need VE evaluate anesthetist charge PACU , surgical team surgical ward . Hemodynamic variable trigger fluid administration decide base standard evaluation hemodynamic parameter , urine output , surgical loss , laboratory test abnormality . The type amount intravenous solution use decide anesthetist charge surgical team . Before VE , hemodynamic variable include HR BP measure research assistant . CVP measure PACU patient receive central venous catheter . Then , ccNexfin system apply standardized fashion accord manufacturer recommendation : appropriately size finger cuff select place around patient 's middle finger . The wrist unit heart reference sensor ( HRS ) place around patient 's wrist ring finger respectively . The system zeroed , sensor end HRS place level patient 's heart , allow compensation hydrostatic pressure difference finger heart . The ccNexfin calculate display value initial post-operative CO , Cardiac Index ( CI ) , SV . One 5 minute end VE , hemodynamic parameter measure . Should bolus fluid administer , FR basic hemodynamic variable measure , upon administration VE order treat team . 2 . Prediction FR administration VE order treat team A fluid challenge 250 ml Lactated Ringer 's solution ( Baxter , Lactated Ringer 's Injection , USP , 1000 mL VIAFLEX Plastic Container ) administer 5 minute research assistant VE . One 5 minute follow end fluid challenge , basic hemodynamic value ( describe ) , well CO , CI , SV obtain ccNexfin system , record . An increase SV least 15 % 1 minute end fluid challenge consider clinically significant . Upon termination fluid challenge , decision weather proceed VE take treat physician base standard sign measure hypovolemia ccNexfin SV CO measurement obtain fluid challenge . The proportion patient identify fluid responsive VE compare proportion patient respond fluid challenge . The research assistant available measure FR 6.30 AM 7.30 PM every day patient hospitalization . For patient safety , research assistant must arrive bedside within ten minute page , order measure FR VE . Intravenous fluid administer without measure CO administer fluid challenge : 1. research assistant able arrive bedside within ten minute ; 2. treat physician considers immediate administration intravenous fluid necessary . CO measurement take administer blood product . Blood product administration ( erythrocyte , platelet , fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate ) also discretion staff anesthetist ( PACU ) discretion surgical team ( surgical ward ) . 3 . Daily assessment FR After surgery PACU , daily ( breakfast ) duration patient 's hospital stay research assistant administer fluid challenge . As described , CO , CI , SV measure research assistant use ccNexfin system , assess FR . A fluid challenge 250 ml Lactated Ringer 's solution ( Baxter , Lactated Ringer 's Injection , USP , 1000 mL VIAFLEX Plastic Container ) administer 5 minute . One 5 minute follow fluid challenge completion , basic hemodynamic value ( describe ) , well CO , CI , SV obtain ccNexfin system , record . An increase SV least 15 % 1 minute end fluid challenge consider clinically significant . Daily assessment FR , regardless whether patient receive intravenous fluid , determine FR associate increase risk complication and/or prolonged hospital stay . All ccNexfin value obtain VE fluid challenge blind treat anesthetist , surgical team nursing team .</detailed_description>
