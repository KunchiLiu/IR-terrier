	<brief_summary>This Phase 1/2a dose-escalation study E6201 , dual MEK1 FLT3 inhibitor , subject advance hematologic malignancy document FLT3 mutation . The Phase1 portion study safety run-in ( 30 subject ) establish recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . The Ph . 2a portion study evaluate two specific patient group : Cohort 1 enroll 26 patient relapsed refractory AML confirm FLT3 mutation ( without Ras mutation ) without prior exposure FLT3 inhibitor Cohort 2 enroll 26 patient relapsed refractory AML confirm FLT3 mutation ( without Ras mutation ) prior exposure FLT3 inhibitor . Cohort 3 enroll 10 patient relapsed refractory AML confirm Ras mutation FLT3 mutation . Cohorts 1 2 expansion phase incorporate Simon 2-stage optimal design . A total N=92 subject enrol study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase 1 ( Safety Run-In ) : Following Screening , total 30 subject 5 dose cohort enrol establish RP2D . The safety run-in phase standard 3+3 cohort design . Phase 2a ( Expansion ) : Once Phase 1 Safety Run-In portion study complete RP2D establish , additional subject enrol Phase 2 Expansion portion three cohort . Cohort 1 enroll 26 patient relapsed refractory AML confirm FLT3 mutation ( without Ras mutation ) without prior exposure FLT3 inhibitor . Cohort 2 enroll 26 patient relapsed refractory AML confirm FLT3 mutation ( without Ras mutation ) prior exposure FLT3 inhibitor . Cohort 3 enroll 10 patient relapsed refractory AML confirm Ras mutation FLT3 mutation . Cohort 1 2 Expansion Phase incorporate Simon 2-stage optimal design . Subjects AML enrol Phase 1 portion study RP2D count towards Phase 2a accrual appropriate cohort . Subjects receive E6201 weekly bi-weekly 28-day schedule , schedule dose level establish safety run-in portion study . Disease assessment , include analysis blood bone marrow aspirate , perform end Cycles 1 3 every 2 cycle thereafter . Disease assessment may make time point discretion Investigator . Subjects demonstrate objective response allow continue therapy E6201 progression disease , observation unacceptable adverse event , intercurrent illness change patient 's condition prevents study participation . ECGs perform study . Blood also collect study hematology , serum chemistry , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics assessment . Bone marrow collect assessment disease response mutational status .</detailed_description>
