	<criteria>1 . Confirmed diagnosis MPS 7 base leukocyte fibroblast glucuronidase enzyme assay , genetic testing . 2 . Under 5 year age time informed consent . 3 . Written inform consent Legally Authorized Representative nature study explain , prior researchrelated procedure . 1 . Undergone successful bone marrow stem cell transplant evidence degree detectable chimaerism donor cell . 2 . Any known hypersensitivity rhGUS excipients , judgment Investigator , place subject increase risk adverse effect . 3 . Use investigational product ( drug device combination ) UX003 within 30 day prior Screening , requirement investigational agent prior completion schedule study assessment time study . 4 . Has condition severity acuity , opinion Investigator , may allow safe study participation . For patient hydrops fetalis , ongoing intervention manage fluid balance continue ; addition ERT consider fluidoverload risk , individual exclude . 5 . Has concurrent disease condition , view Investigator , place subject high risk poor treatment compliance complete study , would interfere study participation affect safety . Since hydropic patient high rate mortality , risk death prior 1 year age consider sufficient exclude patient study compliance .</criteria>
