	<brief_title>The Effect Miswak Chewing Sticks Oral Helicobacter Pylori Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim / Primary objective : To elucidate relationship chew miswak stick H. Pylori infection oral cavity . Specific Objectives To find prevalence oral H.Pylori among Saudi Population To compare reduction count oral H. Pylori among tooth brush user miswak user Secondary Objectives 1 ) To elucidate count type microbiota present tooth brush miswak use . MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Area : The study would conduct College Dentistry , KSAU-HS , Riyadh , KSA . Study Subjects : The study sample would select regular dental patient visit College Dentistry , KSAU-HS , Saudi Arabia . The inclusion criterion would : subject age &gt; 18yrs , &gt; 24 teeth physically/mentally healthy . Oral plaque sample would obtain patient willing participate . As part initial screening plaque sample would collect sent screen oral microbiota Microbiology Biochemistry Department College Medicine , KSAU-HS , NGHA , Riyadh . Here , basic microbial culturing ( rapid urease test ) would perform detect presence oral H.Pylori . Volunteers test positive H. Pylori infection rapid urease test would invite participate study . Study Design : This single blind randomized clinical trial . Data Collection method , instrument use , measurement : The subject would interview information would collect socio demographic characteristic ( Age , gender , socio-economic status , education , occupation ) , diet , related past medical dental history . In addition , oral plaque sample would send 16S rRNA gene sequence baseline reading . The main outcome variable would change time microbiologic data within group . Thus , change number H.Pylori would compare two group regular predetermine interval ( end 1st week , 2nd week , 1st month 3rd month ) . The patient would recall regularly plaque sample would collect send 16S rRNA gene sequence . Gene sequence know provide accurate information specie Helicobacter compare method . Sample collection procedure Purification Microbes The plaque would sample deep pocket remove sterile universal curette . If subgingival supragingival plaque present , would sample . The sampling area would isolate saliva gently dry air . The point would immerse 0.5 ml sterile distil water Eppendorf tube ( epTIPS Standard , Eppendorf AG , Hamburg , Germany ) . This serially dilute isolate microbe use spread pour plat method . Different morphotypes purify maintain . Culturing would do use Lactose Broth ( LB ) Nutrient Agar ( NA ) plat . This provide baseline count H.Pylori , helpful compare future count . Rapid Unease Test Initial sample take screen H. pylorus would send rapid unease test ( Campylobacter-like organism CLO test ) . Plaque sample would place reconstituted vial observe color change yellow red ( case positive sample ) usually take less 60 minute . Characterization pure culture base 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis In order identify bacterial specie near taxon , gene sequence would perform . The 16S rRNA gene would amplify genomic DNA , purify sequence describe earlier Shivaji et al . ( 2000 ) . DNA isolated pure culture amplify individually use set primer complementary conserve region 5 ' 3 ' end 16S rRNA gene ( Lane 1991 ) . The forward reverse primer would use : 5'- GAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3 ' 5'-ACGGCTACCT-TGTTACGACTT- 3 ' , respectively . The PCR would perform 50 μL reaction mixture contain 2.5 unit Taq DNA polymerase ( Takara Bio , Kyoto , Japan ) , 1 X PCR buffer 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2 , 200 μmol/L deoxynucleotide , 0.2 μmol/L primer , 10 μL template DNA . PCR would perform Mastercycler ep Eppendorf thermo cycler ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) follow condition : initial denaturation 1 min 95°C follow 25 cycle 94°C 1 min , 52°C 30 , 72°C 1 min possible extension 7 min 72°C.The reaction product view ultraviolet light . After screen gel PCR product would sequence use two primer give also follow set five forward two reverse primer . The forward primer : TAACACATGCAAGTCGAACG ( 50-70 ) ; CTACGGGAGGC-AGCAGTGGG ( 341-361 ) ; CAGCAGCCGCGGTAATAC ( 518-536 ) ; AAACTCAAAG-GAATTGACGG ( 908-928 ) CATGGCTGTCGTCAGCTCGT ( 1053-1073 ) reverse primer GTATTACCGCGGCTGCTG ( 536-518 ) ACGAGCTGACGACA-GCCATG ( 1073-1053 ) select amplify total 1.5 KB 16S rRNA gene . All sequence ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , CA ) . The number give parenthesis refer nucleotide position primer correspond 16S rDNA Escherichia coli ( Hwang , Kim et al . 2011 ) , The 16S rRNA gene sequence obtain subject BLAST sequence similarity search identify near taxon . Data management analysis plan The data would analyze SPSS Windows 17.0 ( IBM SPSS , Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . After completion data entry , data would check error . The chi-square test would use analyze demographic difference two group . ANOVA would apply assess difference various variable . The Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons test would use continuous data , whereas Fisher 's exact test would use compare frequency categorical variable . Ethical Considerations : This study would seek approval Ethical Committee , College Dentistry , King Saud Bin Abdul-Aziz University Health Sciences ( KSAU-HS ) Ethical Committee King Abdullah International Medical Research Center ( KAIMRC ) . Investigators direct patient contact Would sensitize accord International Conference Harmonization 's Good Clinical Practice ( ICH-GCP ) . Before study , participant would inform study objective sign informed consent would obtain .</detailed_description>
