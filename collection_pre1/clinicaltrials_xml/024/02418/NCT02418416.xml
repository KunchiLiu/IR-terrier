	<brief_title>Novel Approach With Double Agent Artificial Oocyte Activation Repeated Fertilization Failure Due Combined Sperm Oocyte Factor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In case undergoes assist reproduction technique specially Intracytoplasmic sperm injection , subgroup patient fail fertilize poorly fertilize , author recommend chemical activation group patient Ca ionophore still Ca ionophore case total fertilization failure low fertilization specially patient 2 separate factor like teratozoospermia poor quality Oocytes investigator decide test effect double activation method use tow agent proven life birth rate Ca ionophore strontium chloride . We Do intracytoplasmic sperm injection immediately activate oocyte Ca Ionophore follow strontium chloride activation monitoring embryogenesis blastocyst formation pregnancy outcome multicenter assessment .</detailed_description>
