	<brief_title>Observational Study Pediatric Rheumatic Diseases : The CARRA Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The original Childhood Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology Research Alliance ( CARRA ) Registry ( Protocol Number : CRNT_REGST01 ) first establish 2010 advance alliance infrastructure , facilitate expand clinical translational pediatric research , transform culture pediatric rheumatology toward universal participation research . This original CARRA Registry refer throughout protocol CARRA Legacy Registry . Through creation sophisticated informatics infrastructure , provision comprehensive site support engagement family , patient , community , CARRA Registry provide opportunity affect child every CARRA Registry site participate high-quality clinical translational research . Continuation CARRA Registry describe protocol support data collection patient pediatric-onset rheumatic disease . The CARRA Registry form basis future CARRA study . In particular , observational registry use answer press question therapeutic use treat pediatric rheumatic disease , include examine safety question . The Duke Clinical Research Institute ( DCRI ) serve CARRA Clinical Data Coordinating Center ( CDCC ) protocol . Traditional exposure-based post-marketing registry individual therapeutic agent juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatic disease inadequate answer important safety question many reason : - Sample size small detect uncommon important event - No unexposed comparators exist evaluate risk attributable underlying disease - Duration follow-up individual patient short evaluate many potential delayed adverse event ( AEs ) - Sample size inadequate assess myriad complex dynamic concurrent medication regimens common treatment rheumatic disease - Selective patient enrollment limit evaluation co-morbid condition patient factor These limitation prevent patient , family , provider understand true risk benefit therapy order make appropriate inform decision . They also prevent drug manufacturer regulatory agency conduct informed review market product disease . A registry base disease diagnosis rather specific therapeutic agent overcomes many limitation exposure-based single-agent registry assessment delayed uncommon safety event . Indeed , data consolidate disease-based registry `` ... could provide information necessary individual company satisfy post-marketing requirement commitment obviate need individual product registry '' ( letter United States ( US ) Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) CARRA , 21 December 2010 9 December 2011 ) . This protocol detail foundation registry meet objective . The CARRA Registry aim detect understand epidemiology important AEs , include delayed uncommon . Subjects follow active CARRA Registry sit eligible enrollment , regardless past current treatment . Each subject follow prospectively goal 10 year duration ; study continue indefinitely resource allow continue need exists . Data systematically collect , include important patient factor , therapy , serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , protocol-defined event special interest . Selected safety event ( e.g. , malignancy ) adjudicate panel expert via review medical record . The CARRA Registry , disease-based prospective observational registry , enable detection potential safety signal hypothesis-driven , rigorous , adequately-controlled pharmacoepidemiologic study important AEs association therapeutic agent . In addition answer question safety therapeutic , data collect CARRA Registry anticipate serve many valuable us . Within confines observational study design , effectiveness therapeutic agent may examine short- long-term clinical patient-centered outcome . The Registry data collection platform Consensus Treatment Plan research pediatric rheumatic disease . Medication use pediatric rheumatic disease dynamic well characterize . The CARRA Registry represent powerful data source follow drug use pattern provide opportunity study predictor medication use . Important outcome likely influenced factor addition therapy ( e.g. , disease severity ) CARRA Registry position help answer types question . Patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) generate patient outside context clinical encounter may collect Registry provide rich , additional dimension data well understand rheumatic disease . Practitioners may review clinical data site part quality improvement approach well outcomes . Analyses CARRA Registry data aim provide result guide therapeutic decision make affected child , family , provider improve regulatory efficiency reduce cost . Ultimately , approach might serve model successful collaboration research community network , industry , public agency promote effective efficient evaluation drug device across regulatory continuum .</detailed_description>
