	<brief_summary>Previous work indicate 2 month androgen pre-treatment may equip preantral follicle FSH receptor increase cohort follicle survive recruitable antral stage . In regard may result increase oocyte yield reproductive outcome woman poor ovarian response . These finding provide strong rationale definitive large RCT . The TTRANSPORT study include 400 woman poor ovarian response randomize receive pre-treatment transdermal testosterone gel placebo order provide conclusive evidence regard superiority transdermal testosterone pre-treatment management poor ovarian responder fulfil Bologna criterion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testosterone TRANSdermal Gel Poor Ovarian Responders Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies primates show treatment testosterone increase number grow follicle , lead proliferation granulosa theca cell , finally reduce apoptosis granulosa cell ( Vendola et al. , 1999 ; Weil et al. , 1999 ) . These study suggest androgen may specific action pre-antral small antral follicle , prior serve substrate estradiol synthesis large follicle regard influence responsiveness ovary gonadotropins amplify effect FSH ovary . Despite available evidence , 3 small RCTs evaluate effect transdermal testosterone infertile patient poor ovarian response stimulation . A pooled analysis study demonstrate benefit clinical ongoing pregnancy rate testosterone pre-treated patient ( González-Comadran et al. , 2012 ) . However , two trial considerably small , whereas restrict testosterone administration 5 21 day prior ovarian stimulation . Evidence basic research early trial suggest androgen administer least 2 month initiation ovarian stimulation ( Casson PR , 2000 ) , order affect preantral follicle equip FSH receptor attempt large cohort follicle survive recruitable antral stage . Taking account promising result recently conduct small RCTS , investigator decide perform double blind placebo control randomize control trial , adequate sample size , order test effect administration transdermal testosterone poor ovarian responder fulfil Bologna criterion , 2 month prior ovarian stimulation long agonist protocol . The daily dose transdermal testosterone gel ( TTG ) 0.55gr ( 5.5mg testosterone/day ) . The specific dose select base previous pharmacokinetic study woman accord daily application 5 mg transdermal testosterone cream ( Fooladi , 2014 ) TTG ( Singh et al . 2006 , Nathorst-Böös et al. , 2005 ) likely restore fT level premenopausal reference range . Although side effect describe pre-treatment high dose 12.5mg TTG 21 day previous randomize control trial ( Kim et al. , 2011 ) , likely high dos result supraphysiological TT fT level . Therefore dose 0.55gr TTG ( 5.5mg testosterone/day ) select T-TRANSPORT trial since restore TT fT level level within upper normal reference range .</detailed_description>

Two three follow criterion essential order classify patient poor ovarian responder : advanced maternal age ( ≥40 year ) risk factor poor ovarian response poor ovarian response ( ≤3 oocytes conventional stimulation protocol ) abnormal ovarian reserve test ( AFC &lt; 7 follicle ) Perimenopausal woman amenorrhea regular cycle Basal FSH &gt; 20 IU/l Uterine abnormalities Recent history current untreated endocrine abnormality ; Unilateral bilateral hydrosalpinx ( visible USS , unless clip ) ; Contraindications use gonadotropin ; Recent history severe disease require regular treatment Use androgens last 3 month Patients shBG value &lt; 20nmol/L &gt; 160nmol/L Azoospermia ( sperm derive Fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) Testicular sperm extraction ( TESE ) )</criteria>
