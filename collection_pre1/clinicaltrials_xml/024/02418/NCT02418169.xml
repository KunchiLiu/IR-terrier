	<brief_title>Association Between Craniofacial Fractures Brain Injuries : Diagnostic Therapeutic Considerations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A part mild TBIs remain undiagnosed . Therefore primary diagnostics trauma patient need improved . According study , part trauma patient ' concomitant injury n't diagnose emergency room ( ER ) diagnose later clinic . In addition difficult diagnostics treatment patient demand close co- operation many speciality . The aim study evaluate association TBIs facial fracture . The real amount facial fracture patient severe TBI clinical significance fracture evaluate . Also number patient facial fracture concomitant TBI evaluate . The aim find amount patient miss diagnosis . Other aims determine effect type location facial fracture in- cidence severity TBI . With help result would possible improve comprehensive diagnostics early treatment patient facial fracture TBI . The retrospective prospective data patient TBI and/or facial fracture collect- ed Turku University Hospital . The comparison two group give information amount patient miss diagnosis TBI facial fracture . The result utilise plan strategy comprehensive diagnostics treatment patient .
