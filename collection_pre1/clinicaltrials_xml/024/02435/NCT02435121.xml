	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To determine objective response rate ( ORR ) . Secondary Objectives : To assess duration response ( DR ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . To evaluate global safety profile . To determine pharmacokinetic profile . To assess clinical utility fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) assay selection patient mesenchymal-epithelial hybridization ( MET ) gene amplification . To assess lung cancer symptom , health-related quality life treatment satisfaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assessing Efficacy Safety SAR125844 NSCLC Patients With MET Amplification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration study 1 patient include screen period 3 week , 3-week treatment cycle ( ) follow-up period . The patient treat 6 cycle case response observe , treatment may continue beyond 6 cycle case partial response/complete response ( PR/CR ) significant clinical benefit progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity , willingness stop study treatment study termination sponsor . After completion study treatment patient follow every 6 week death study cut-off date , whichever come first . For patient went-off study treatment prior disease progression document , date disease progression anticancer treatment collect follow-up visit . The cut-off date corresponds date treat patient 3 post-baseline tumor assessment early discontinue whatever reason . Beyond cut-off date , patient continue study treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity patient 's refusal , provide clinical benefit establish .</detailed_description>
