	<brief_summary>Continuation antipsychotic drug treatment least 12 month remission first psychotic episode represent gold clinical standard , recommend international treatment guideline . Numerous study show risk relapse significantly increase , drug treatment terminate prematurely . However , minority patient achieve functional remission , even fully comply treatment . Long-term adverse effect currently available drug , specifically brain grey matter loss development supersensitivity psychosis , might outweigh benefit . Thus , current standard long-term maintenance antipsychotic treatment , primary goal relapse prevention , question . Here investigator hypothesise intermittent antipsychotic treatment ( target exclusively positive symptom ) initiate first psychotic episode associate less regional global brain ( grey matter ) volume loss period twelve month continuous antipsychotic treatment . Furthermore , investigator hypothesise target treatment approach associate well functional outcome ( few negative symptom , well cognitive performance , good quality life ) continuous antipsychotic treatment , although latter initially associate few relapse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient first episode schizophrenia admit hospital participate consortium undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) soon possible admission . Ideally , procedure perform initiation antipsychotic treatment ( benzodiazepine allow ) . If possible clinical reason , antipsychotic treatment start MRI acquire within three day initiation drug treatment . The choice antipsychotic make treat physician . All approve antipsychotic permit , include first-generation antipsychotic haloperidol flupenthixol . This base recommendation British NICE guideline : `` In nine randomized control trial ( RCTs ) total 1,801 participant first-episode early schizophrenia ( include people recent onset schizophrenia people never treat antipsychotic medication ) , evidence suggest clinically significant difference efficacy antipsychotic drug examine . '' ( NICE 2009 , p. 105 ) . However , since second-generation antipsychotic ( SGA ) consider first-line treatment schizophrenia accord German S3 guideline , assume 80 % patient treat SGA . As soon positive symptom sufficiently control , medication completely taper within four week . Sufficient control positive symptom define follow : `` delusion '' ( Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) item 1 ) , `` hallucinatory behaviour '' ( PANSS item 3 ) , `` suspiciousness/persecution '' ( PANSS item 6 ) `` absent '' `` mild '' ( score 1 2 ) . The PANSS Positive score ( 7 item ) must 18 . Patients experimental group reach remission accord definition switch another antipsychotic accord clinical standard .
