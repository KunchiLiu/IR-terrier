	<criteria>1 . Patient present MRA , CTA angiographically confirm , wide neck ( &gt; 4 mm dome neck ratio &lt; 2 ) intracranial aneurysm locate bifurcation 2 . The target aneurysm vessel diameter 2.7 mm 4.5mm . 3 . The patient 18 year old time consent 4 . The patient sign IRB/EC approve informed consent form 5 . In opinion physician , placement PulseRider technically feasible clinically indicate 6 . Subject mental capacity willing able comply protocol requirement followup 1 . Unstable neurological deficit ( condition worsen within last 90 day ) 2 . Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ( SAH ) within last 60 day 3 . Irreversible bleed disorder 4. mRS score ≥3 5 . Patient another aneurysm , Investigator 's opinion , require treatment within follow period ( 365 day ) 6 . Platelet count &lt; 100 x 103 cells/mm3or know platelet dysfunction 7 . Inability tolerate , adverse reaction contraindication take aspirin clopidogrel 8 . A history contrast allergy medically control 9 . Known allergy nickel 10 . Relative contraindication angiography ( e.g. , serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL ) 11 . Woman childbearing potential provide negative pregnancy test 12 . Evidence active infection ( fever temperature &gt; 38°C and/or WBC &gt; 15,000 ) 13 . Other condition heart , blood , brain intracranial vessel carry high risk neurologic event 14 . Evidence disease condition expect compromise survival ability complete followup assessment 365day followup period 15 . Extracranial stenosis great 50 % parent artery require access lesion 16 . Intracranial stenosis great 50 % treated vessel 17 . Extreme vessel tortuosity prohibits appropriate control microguide wire and/or PulseRider delivery wire</criteria>
