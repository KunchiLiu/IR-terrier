	<brief_summary>There surgical procedure help child intractable fecal incontinence gain continence stool construction tube connects abdominal wall colon near appendix . This tube allow easy administration enema solution first part colon . Putting enema solution tube colon call antegrade continence enema ACE show work well help child prevent stool accident . The purpose study compare large volume ACE flush use salt water solution call normal saline small volume ACE flush use liquid glycerin . The aim study : 1 ) find effective dose flush frequency solution ; 2 ) compare solution give best dose take least amount time clear colon stool , least side effect , effective prevent stool accident ; 3 ) determine administration either ACE flush solution affect colon health bacteria colon .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fecal incontinence past time toilet train devastate affected child . Antegrade continence enema ( ACE ) therapy administer catheterizable stoma surgically place cecum help child intractable fecal incontinence attain continence stool . There number retrospective study demonstrate variable effectiveness rate ACE therapy . This variability may due use flush . There prospective trial evaluate effectiveness different flushing regimen . . The catheterizable stoma use antegrade administration enema solution frequently make bring appendix abdominal wall place skin-level device ( button ) cecum . ACE therapy administration appendix cecum potential disrupt gut microbial ecosystem , cause dysbiosis immune dysfunction . The effect ACE administration colonic microbiome mucosal immunity investigate . This pilot study compare high volume normal saline ( NS ) flush low volume USP glycerin flush . The primary aim study compare solution , give optimal dose frequency , deliver least amount time , few side effect , promote high degree fecal continence quality life , determine administration antegrade enema solution appendicostomy/cecostomy affect gut microbiota .</detailed_description>
