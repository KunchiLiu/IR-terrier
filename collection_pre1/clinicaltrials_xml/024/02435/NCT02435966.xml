	<brief_title>Dry Needling Patients With Chronic Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective single-blind randomize controlled trial , design assess efficacy dry needling treatment chronic neck pain . The treatment regimes simulate standard physiotherapy administer real clinical setting . Patients intervention group receive combination manual therapy dry needling ( 40mmx0,32 guide needle ) . There two control group . In first one , patient receive combination manual therapy sham dry needling . In second control group , patient receive treatment order assess natural history disease . Patients receive two treatment session interval 7 day follow 30 day . The primary outcome subjective pain assess Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . Secondary outcome pressure pain threshold ( assessed manual algometer ) , neck range motion ( assessed goniometer ) Neck Disability Index ( standardize questionnaire ) . Measurements take pre post-test first second treatment session , plus follow-up , except Neck Disability Index ( begin second treatment ) . In non-treated group , patient measure time interval . The sample size calculate detect VAS difference 2 point , minimally clinically important difference establish literature . Then double order avoid possible dropout . The trial take place private practice Madrid ( Physios , c/Valverde 26 ) . Patients randomized computer program . Patients explore active trigger point upper trapezius levator scapula . They meet criteria identification establish Travell &amp; Simons Trigger point manual . The investigator also seek trigger point follow Travell &amp; Simons ' pain map two muscle , identify five trigger point area . The investigator select active , taking pressure pain threshold measurement active trigger point , normalize value accord normal threshold five area two muscle . The normal threshold assess pilot study healthy patient . The investigator administer either dry sham dry needle active ( one low pain threshold ) throughout trial . Dry needle apply follow Hong 's technique 40mmx0,32 guide needle , physiotherapist 4 year experience technique .</detailed_description>
