	<brief_title>The Sequential Oral Sensory Approach Limited Food Repertoire Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Feeding problem child diagnose autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) find vary 46-89 % , significant variability feeding pattern . Feeding problem lead failure thrive , nutritional deficiency , growth retardation , social deficit poor academic achievement . Common feed problem typify limited food repertoire , food refusal high frequency single food intake . The etiology feed problem child ASD multifactorial include sensory issue , perseveration , avoidance novel stimuli food intolerance . No single aetiology assign limited food repertoire child diagnose ASD . A recent meta-analysis feeding problem nutritional intake child diagnose ASD reveals child ASD feed problem compare peer ( odds ratio 5.11 , 95 % Confidence interval ( CI ) 3.74-6.97 ) . There significantly low intake calcium protein . Children diagnose ASD limit food repertoire compare typically develop child ( 19.0 ( 5.0 ) food eat vs. 22.5 ( 4.6 ) food eaten , p value 0.0003 ) evidence nutritional inadequacy poor bone growth . The impact feed problem extend home environment may contribute parental stress affect bonding/ attachment child caregiver mealtimes . This phenomenon explore depth current research . Behavioural intervention use interdisciplinary team model hallmark intervention treatment feed problem child diagnose ASD . However limited research data available field . Behavioural intervention approach describe literature include stimulus control , positive reinforcement , negative reinforcement , discrimination training , extinction , punishment desensitization . Positive reinforcement-based intervention , physical guidance , non-removal spoon technique find useful base case report . These intervention require highly structured environment , costly time parent involve management plan , thus limit generalizability . There consensus regard technique superior effective . There three publish interventional study directly address feed problem ASD . These span intensive inpatient management behavioural patient base curriculum . A retrospective chart review 37 child 2 year period see group intervention session use Sequential Oral Sensory ( SOS ) approach show promise increase food variability intake . The Sequential Oral Sensory ( SOS ) approach multidisciplinary program assess treat child feed weight problem . This program use systematic desensitization hierarchy skill necessary child progress eat various food texture . The technique patient control , patient `` allow move away '' exposure . The goal therapy maintain compete response face increase incremental exposure . The SOS approach effective present affordable treatment option , natural outpatient set utilizes parental participation supervision may translate generalizability home environment . Given prevalence feed challenge ASD explore option undertaken give suggested implication .</detailed_description>
