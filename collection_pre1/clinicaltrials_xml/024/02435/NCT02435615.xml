Easy use point care test need improve dengue diagnosis . Oral fluid collection may simple , non-invasive way diagnose dengue community . However , currently unknown oral fluid accurate way diagnose dengue use specialize oral fluid collector could help improve dengue diagnosis . In study , investigator analyze oral fluid suspect dengue patient compare serum sample dengue diagnosis .

	<brief_title>Diagnosing Dengue : Evaluating Utility Oral Fluid Dengue Diagnosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dengue continue spread threaten approximately 3.6 billion people . It crucial adequately recognize dengue start early intervention . Dengue virus ( DENV ) infection typically confirm virus isolation nucleic acid detection , require train personnel advance facility limit develop country . Detection antibodies serve viable cheap diagnostic alternative , one method oral fluid . Detecting DENV antibody oral fluid accomplish . The utility oral fluid attractive specimen acquire faster , non-invasive manner suitable child needle-phobic adult . One challenge use oral fluid dengue diagnosis typically , oral fluid contains analytes find blood , albeit low concentration , thus need protein concentration oral fluid use diagnosis . A device capable collect oral fluid Sani-Sal® oral fluid collector , use successfully rapid diagnostics HIV . It unique device claim concentrate oral fluid protein , decrease oral fluid viscosity , stimulate salivation . These property make Sani-Sal® potentially valuable diagnosis DENV field concentrate antibody identify early infection . Furthermore , dengue commonly misdiagnosed undiagnosed give vary clinical manifestation , lack patient health seek behavior , lack incentive physician confirm report case . Knowledge health-seeking behavior dengue patient remain limited . We also assess patient practitioner perception regard dengue diagnostics , care , report consider utility novel diagnostic technology . Lastly , seek understand role governance communicable disease surveillance , report information flow . This application seek approval pilot study seek determine whether SaniSal® useful DENV diagnosis concentrate DENV IgM antibodies NS1 antigen . The study also like explore knowledge , attitude , practice health seek behavior patient , understand dengue training , diagnosis reporting amongst practitioner . The study conduct partnership Instituto Nacional de Diabetes ( INDEN ) Dr. Roberto Reid Cabral 's Children 's Hospital Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic—where dengue endemic . The utility oral-fluid diagnostics promising : serve efficient tool point-of-care practice alternative blood-draw . If study show saliva equally effective detection DENV blood ELISA confirmatory test , mitigate limitation serum test . This result increase rapid diagnostic confirmation suspect case , improve patient comfort care assist target vector control . This coupled insight policy , perception behavior surround DENV help improve point-of-care diagnostics , report surveillance , community education effort epidemics endemic country Caribbean region .</detailed_description>
