	<detailed_description>This PI initiate , randomize clinical trial exercise vs. usual care among men opt active surveillance prostate cancer . The AS RCT study randomize control trial 16-weeks aerobic exercise ( e.g. , brisk walking ) vs. usual care among 150 men prostate cancer active surveillance . After obtain write informed consent , enrolled subject schedule baseline assessment . The men randomize Intervention Arm engage individually tailor aerobic exercise program ( home-based walking ) follow principle aerobic exercise training guideline adult recommend American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) . The men Control Arm ask continue typical exercise practice 16 week . Men arm ask complete questionnaire baseline week 16 , month 12 &amp; 24 . Specimens biopsy review investigator ' collaborator , GenomeDx , RNA characterization assessment genomic risk score . There also non-randomized observational component study collect biospecimens , survey , data , administer one CPET . Individuals enrol group include meet eligibility criterion RCT , wish RCT , interested participate lifestyle research . This group also provide u large heterogeneous population follow long term examine association exercise , biomarkers , fitness metric , clinical psychosocial outcome .</detailed_description>
