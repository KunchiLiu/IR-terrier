	<brief_summary>Background : - Inflammation body react infection injury . . Infections inflammation brain nerve serious . There always good test detect . Researchers want learn disease affect brain nerve develop good test treatment . Objective : - To learn inflammation infection hurt brain nervous system . Eligibility : - People least 2 year old diagnosis suspect diagnosis nervous system infection inflammation . Design : - For participant , clinician outside NIH collect blood , tissue , sample . These send NIH analyze . - Other participant several visit NIH . Children may test . - Participants : - Medical history . - Physical neurological exam . - Blood urine sample collect . - Saliva collect . They chew piece sterile cotton one minute . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . The scanner metal cylinder strong magnetic field . Participants lie table slide cylinder . Participants get contrast agent intravenous ( IV ) catheter MRI . A needle use guide thin plastic tube ( catheter ) arm vein . - Lumbar puncture . Skin numb needle inserted space bone back . Fluid remove . - Some participant may optional study procedure . These may include eye test , memory think testing , test electrodes head , skin biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study examine natural course infectious inflammatory disease nervous system , identify causative associate pathogen unknown , generally good understand underlie immunological , genetic pathophysiologic mechanism cause contribute disease ultimate neurological outcome . Study Population : The study population patient least 2 year old know suspected infection inflammation nervous system . Subjects recruit referral NIH . Design : This longitudinal case series standardize research data collection predefined time point . Subjects schedule visit NIH either outpatient inpatient . The core research evaluation include : comprehensive history neurological examination ; blood , urine , saliva collection ; neuroimaging ; lumbar puncture . All subject willing able ask return least 1-year follow visit . Subjects eligible longitudinal follow clinical phenotype fully characterize subject ill participate evaluation . Additionally , also enroll subject know suspected infection inflammation nervous system biological sample collect outside clinician process retain research analysis . Outcome Measures : The study outcomes primarily characterization vary inflammatory infectious nervous system disease . These characterization include : clinical phenotype biomarkers .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : At time enrollment , subject : 1 . Have know suspected infection inflammation nervous system base clinical imaging data provide referral facility . For purpose study , neuroinfectious disease neuroinflammation define follow : 1. fever nervous system sign symptom ( exclude delirium ) 2. neurological symptom accompany cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) evidence inflammation ( may include pleocytosis , hypoglycorrachia , elevate protein , evidence intrathecal immune activation include IgG index presence oligoclonal band ) 3. systemic infection inflammatory disease neurological involvement 4. neuroimaging suggestive infection inflammation ( example , presence contrastenhancing lesion CT MRI ) 5. clinical presentation suggestive infection inflammatory process nervous system without good explanation 2 . Be willing participate protocol procedure , unless clinically contraindicate 3 . Be willing provide inform consent , either directly via appoint legally authorize representative 4 . Be willing consent collection clinical data biological sample cryopreservation 5 . Be least 2 year old INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PROCESSING OF BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES ONLY : At time enrollment , subject : 1 . Have know suspected infection inflammation nervous system base clinical imaging data provide referral facility .

Be least 2 year old EXCLUSION CRITERIA : At time enrollment , subject : 1 . Not clinically significant medical condition , best judgment investigator , may expose patient undue risk harm prevent patient complete study ( example include , limited , ischemic cardiomyopathy , clot disorder , brittle diabetes ) 2 . Not acute unstable medical condition , best judgement investigator , would difficult handle NIH Clinical Center 3 . Not clearlyestablished diagnosis wellcharacterized disease entity validate treatment algorithm propose resource investment , opinion investigator , would contribute advancement knowledge EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PROCESSING OF BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES ONLY : At time enrollment , subject : 1 . A clearlyestablished diagnosis wellcharacterized disease entity validate treatment algorithm propose resource investment , opinion investigator , would contribute advancement knowledge</criteria>
