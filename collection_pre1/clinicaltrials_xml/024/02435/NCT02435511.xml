	<brief_summary>CommunityRx health information technology-based innovation , start patient-health care provider encounter , facilitate self-care coordination patient , caregiver , provider . The CommunityRx database interfaces electronic medical record provide patient `` HealtheRx . '' A HealtheRx list community-based self-care resource tailor patient health need ( e.g. , person diabetes receive information podiatrist , nutrition class , resource need manage diabetes ) . CommunityRx aim measurably improve health health care reduce health care cost especially underserved health care setting . Specifically , propose research aim 1 ) evaluate impact CommunityRx health care utilization , cost , health , patient-centered outcome program participant compare control ; 2 ) examine flow spread information primary agent include : program participant , community health information expert , healthcare provider , community-based service provider ( business organization provide self-care resource ) ; 3 ) build use agent-based model test distribute impact , include economic effect , CommunityRx system adoption demonstration area predict performance time conduct experiment vary assumption agent , environment , population-level characteristic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CommunityRx connect health care self-care . CommunityRx begin medical encounter function like e-prescribing system , model medication e-prescribing.9 Rather send medication prescription patient 's pharmacy , HealtheRx `` prescription '' automatically generate point care , deliver patient paper ( electronic ) form store Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) future reference . The HealtheRx ontologically-generated , driven standard demographic ( eg . age , gender , address , language ) data field EMR customize patient problems/diagnoses like `` homelessness , '' `` obesity . '' Like e-prescribing medicine , CommunityRx involve prescribe , fulfillment ( patient sign Weight Watchers class ) , administration ( patient participates weight loss program ) ( Fig . 2 ) .10 The HealtheRx prescription primary information agent system , driven simple ontologic rule generate complexity , include iteration CommunityRx system , human agent interact self-care information . CommunityRx best understood part complex adaptive system . The HealtheRx , contrast drug prescription , design specifically enhance interpersonal aspect patient-physician encounter , inform agent self-care resource . A patient receives HealtheRx contact Community Health Information Specialist ( CHIS ) . She seek self-care resource . Data capture CommunityRx system patient referral need distribute community-based service provider ( CBSPs ) form quarterly report deliver CBSP contact cultivate CHIS . These data efficiently reveal CBSPs real-time need gap self-care resource . The investigator hypothesize data use CBSPs time ensure supply . Youth generate community resource data employment MAPSCorps also gain insight community resource engage CBSP personnel CHIS gather data . Youth spread information network community resource increase use resource . MAPSCorps data community resource share publicly ( www.healtherx.org , www.southsidehealth.org , www.dondeesta.org ) . Self-care becomes efficient . Supply meet demand . Patients provider time resource devote salubrious activity CBSPs become strong . Over time , transparency market self-care resource increase competition quality . This hypothetical dynamic example emergent self-organization complex adaptive system . The intervention start simple encounter , govern simple rule , patient health care provider . As number encounter grow , previously siloed sector - health care self-care - evolve new kind formation far efficient community current state . CommunityRx drive new formation multiple agent unaware complexity produce : `` …the self-organized structure simply emerge result individual thing , independently . '' In evaluate economic effect CommunityRx adoption , agent-based modeling ( ABM ) test close attractor state , end-point CommunityRx system configuration ( set assume behavior design intervention ) , come Pareto efficient point equilibrium . The effect CommunityRx intervention non-linear , involve interaction feedback loop , therefore require complex system model approach evaluation . A . Purpose Hypothesis Data input agent base modeling ( ABM ) come range source , include empirical quantitative qualitative data , data literature , expert opinion . Because CommunityRx target people age ( 0-99 yr , date ) , prospective , experimental , community-based design ( eg . RCT ) ass outcomes age stratum would informative patient agent ( investigator expect age-group difference behavior , social network , outcome ) cost-prohibitive . ABM accommodate assumption make base important , specific , population subgroup ( `` testbed '' ) , include many agent , allow multiple simulation assess impact variation assumption much large diverse population system-wide model include . A cost-effectiveness analysis need understand true economic impact CommunityRx total cost burden disease . In addition , research team bring clinical research expertise specialize interest middle-age older adult population chronic disease . Focusing subgroup build track record meaningfully extend contribution gerontology geriatrics field . Specifically , aim ( associate hypothesis ) research include : Aim 1 . Evaluate impact CommunityRx health care utilization , cost , health , patient-centered outcome program participant ( patient receive care clinical demonstration site live 16 zip code area ) compare control ( patient receive health care demonstration site , live outside 16 zip code area ) , special focus middle-age older adult . Aim 1a . Evaluate impact CommunityRx health care utilization , health care cost , health outcome program participant ( patient receive care clinical demonstration site live 16 zip code area ) compare control ( patient receive health care demonstration site , live outside 11 zip code area ) age . NOTE : This aim fund separately register clinicaltrials.gov separately ( see ID 1C1CMS330997 ) . Hypothesis : CommunityRx decrease emergency/inpatient care utilization , decrease percent per beneficiary per year ( % PBPY ) cost improve health . Aim 1b . Evaluate impact CommunityRx system patient-centered outcome randomize control trail 200 program participant age 45-74 compare 200 control . Hypothesis : CommunityRx associate clinically meaningful improvement : ) self-care behavior ; b ) perceive care quality ; c ) quality life . Aim 1c . Characterize economic value care augment CommunityRx system compare usual care , base prospective participant-control study describe Aim 1b . Hypothesis : Compared usual care , care augment CommunityRx system cost-effective commonly accept medical device treatment . Aim 2 . Examine flow spread information primary agent include : program participant , community health information specialist , healthcare provider , community-based service provider ( business organization provide self-care resource ) . Hypotheses : 1 ) Among CBSPs receive high volume CommunityRx referral people ≥45 year old ( &gt; 1000/year ) , CommunityRx produce self-reported increase : ) knowledge community resource especially old adult , b ) referral CBSPs , c ) old client volume , ) aging-related goods/services /programs inventory ; 2 ) Delivery CommunityRx intervention point medical care produce knowledge self-care resource community spread secondary agent include member patient provider social network . Aim 3 . Build use agent-based model test distribute impact , include economic effect , CommunityRx adoption demonstration area predict performance time conduct experiment vary assumption agent , environment , population-level characteristic . Hypotheses : 1 ) The system-level value CommunityRx great value quantify % PBPY health care utilization saving project increase population age ; 2 ) Experiments run systems-based model predict quantify impact strategy optimize CommunityRx performance improvement , sustainability , spread setting ; 3 ) Systems-Based Modeling effective efficient tool large-scale evaluation health information technology-based intervention improve health health care .</detailed_description>
