	<brief_summary>Background : Patients degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis usually present low back pain , muscle spasm weakness , radicular symptom , intermittent claudication , insomnia , even urine stool incontinence . There research effectiveness core spine stabilization exercise , balance training , balance effect wear lumbar corset patient . Purpose : To investigate 1 ) correlation dynamic balance degree disability characteristic spinopelvic alignment . 2 ) potential predictor dynamic spino-pelvic instability , 3 ) effectiveness core spine stabilization exercise , balance training balance effect wear lumbar corset patient degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis . Method : Patients older 50 year age lumbar spondylitis degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis , diagnose KUB lateral radiography lumbar-sacral spine neutral , flexion-extension , recruit . Among , seventy patient degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis recruit experimental group thirty-five patient lumbar spondylitis recruit control group . Exclusion criteria patient old 80 year age , stroke , spinal cord injury , head injury neurological deficit , previous operation vertebra fracture , pelvis low limb , isthmic lumbar spondylolisthesis , cognitive impairment . All subject receive Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , Oswestry Disability Index , Quebec back pain disability scale , postural stability test , 75 % limit stability test , modify clinical test sensory integration , evaluation fall risk test Biodex balance system begin end program . Both control experimental group receive rehabilitation training , include hot packing , interferential therapy , core spine stabilization exercise lower extremity strengthen exercise 2-3 time week , 8 week , 15 session total . Patients experimental group randomly assign either balance training group group without balance training . The balance training include weight shift train random control train Biodex balance system . A balance effect wear lumbar corset evaluate begin program . The investigator follow patient telephone 3 month program completion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Rehabilitation Outcome Patients With Lumbar Spondylolisthesis . A Prospective Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects Seventy patient lumbar spondylolisthesis randomly assign group treat balance training without balance training , another thirty-five age-matched lumbar spondylitis without spondylolisthesis assign control group . The clinical history , age , gender , body weight , body height , job , symptom sign , Visual Analogue Scalce ( VAS ) , Questionnairem ( Quebec back pain disability scale ) Oswestry Disability Index record base rehabilitation program . Every subject sign inform consent , obtain Institutional Review Board Chang Gung Memorial Hospital . Physical examination It include duration , pain intensity , neurologic deficit , muscle power lower limb , deep tendon reflex , sensation , stretch sign nerve conduction velocity , electromyography examination . Radiography All subject receive Kidney Ureter Bladder ( KUB ) stand lateral radiography lumbar-sacral spine neutral , determine pelvic incidence , pelvic tilt , sacral slope etc . Furthermore patient spondylolisthesis receive flexion-extension lumbar-sacral spine determine degree translational motion vertebra . Rehabilitation Correct body posture lift technique instruct . After patient 's back pain subside degree le 5 visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , balance test assess use Biodex Balance System ( BBS ) , include postual stability test , limit stability test , modify clinical test sensory intergration fall risk test . The spondylolisthesis patient assess wear without wear lumbar corset begin program , test random order . The tester BBS blind patient 's grouping . The anterio-posterior , medial-lateral stability index overall stability index etc record . Both group receive 2-3 time week , 8 week , 15 session total . Each session include 15-minute hot packing , 15-minutes interferential therapy , 25 minute core spine stablilzation exercise low extremity strengthen exercise stationary bicycle . And patient experimental group randomly assign either balance training group group without balance training . The balance training include weight shift train random control train Biodex balance system . A balance effect wear lumbar corset evaluate begin program . Balance test 1 . Postual stability test : Patients stand barefoot platform slight knee flexion , look straight ahead arm across chest platform , subject ask maintain quiet stance platform second initialization . Six stability trial perform eye open eye close period 20 second , 3 trial per state , 10-second count rest countdown trial . 2 . Limits stabitiy ( LOS ) test ( 75 % LOS ) : indicator dynamic control within normalize envelope . Nine target blink random order screen . Patient shift body weight move cursor frorm center target blink target back quickly little deviation possible . The overall direction control overall , forward , backward , right , leave , forward/right , forward/right , backward/right backward/left record . 3 . Modified clinical test sensory intergration : It consist first condition : eye open firm surface , second condition : eye close firm surface , third condition : eye open foam surface fourth condition : eye close foam surface 4 . Fall risk test : identify high potential fall risk patient . Rehabilitation program ( Home base outpatient training ) Education : Both home base outpatient training patient instruct use superficial heat relief back pain , muscle spasm ; correct posture activity daily live ( sit , stand , sleep , work drive ) , lift technique , avoidance certain movement posture , prolong stand sitting , slouch soft armchair , sag bed mattress , wear high heel carry heavy object . And lumbar corset stabilization spine recommend . Outpatient program : Two three time week , 15 treatment session , 60 minute per session , 8 week . It include hot pack and/or interferential therapy 15 minute . Exercise ( 25 min ) begin short warm-up aerobic exercise , upper back shoulder extension exercise , pectoral stretching exercise , back extension exercise , combine deep-breathing exercise ; core strengthening program , include cat camel , abdominal hollowing , bridge , dead bug , quadruped etc . The exercise 3 session 10-15 repetition . Balance train Balance training : rehabilitation program ( total 15 session , 2-3 time week ) 1 . Weight shift train Guiding move point ( ) quarter one quarter three , ( b ) quarter two quarter four , ( c ) parallel vertical line feedback screen ( anterior-posterior direction ) 2 . Random train It ideal motor control vestibular training . Static mode : work within sway envelope move cursor attempt keep within move target . Dynamic mode : use hip , knee ankle strategy manipulate move palteform 's cursor within random move target .</detailed_description>
