	<brief_summary>Appropriate delivery quality healthcare require constant monitoring patient follow , particularly presence chronic disease . This approach improve leading edge tool support diagnosis , well prediction , identification monitoring adverse event available . COMOESTAS aim develop innovative Information Communications Technology ( ICT ) system allow patient chronic condition receive continuous personalize treatment . The whole system base advanced , `` one '' Alerting Decision Support System follow patient diagnosis support physician manage therapy , control relevant event impact patient safety activate specific procedure select threshold exceed . In frame chronic neurological disorder , Medication Overuse Headache ( MOH ) common condition major cause disability . MOH curable , outcome hamper high risk relapse . It , therefore , perfect example disorder benefit ICT-assisted approach develop innovative system service monitor chronic condition . COMOESTAS goal achieve improve integrate traditional paper headache diary calendar innovative ICT tool take account complex issue accompany peculiar form headache , make patient key node entire process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medication Overuse Headache ( MOH ) Innovative Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It multicentre parallel group study . The two arm clinical protocol 1 ) classic approach MOH 2 ) Interactive Electronic Patient Record ( IEPR ) -based approach MOH . Each arm last 12 month . MOH diagnose accord 2006 MOH-R criterion International Headache Society report : A. Headache present &gt; 15 days/month . B . Regular overuse &gt; 3 month one acute symptomatic drug : 1 . Ergotamine , triptans , opioids combination analgesic medication &gt; 10 days/month regular basis &gt; 3 month . 2 . Simple analgesic combination ergotamine , triptans , analgesic opioids &gt; 15 days/month regular basis &gt; 3 month without overuse ( &gt; 10 day ) single class alone . C. Headache develop markedly worsen medication overuse . The IEPR approach preliminarily test validated small group patient month 6-12 ( pilot validation ) . Each patient evaluate period 7 month . Classic approach Visit 0 : patient examine , suspect suffer MOH , ask fill diary month order quantify parameter MOH ( day headache , acute drug consume , etc. ) . Patient report MOH-R criterion fulfil previous 2 month . Visit 1 : Patient return Centre , diary data analyze record , , criterion MOH-R diagnosis fulfil exclusion criterion rule , patient enrol COMOESTAS protocol . Detoxification : following visit 1 , patient undergoes detoxification accord protocol Appendix 1 . In subsequent 2 month patient instructed record headache characteristic consumption symptomatic drug paper diary . Visit 2 ( 2 month detoxification ) : patient visit ; diary check ; therapy successful ( patient longer overuse acute medication headache ) patient schedule follow-up visit 4 month . The patient ask keep recording headache characteristic consumption symptomatic drug paper diary next 4 month inform telephone contact 2 month . Visit 3 ( 6 month detoxification ) : patient visit , diary data collect . Study end . IEPR approach Visit 0 : patient examine , minimum data set IEPR MOH satisfy , patient ask record headache characteristic well acute drug consumption paper diary month order ass baseline parameter MOH ( day headache , acute drug consume , etc. ) . Patient report MOH-R criterion fulfil previous 2 month . Visit 1 : Patient return Centre , diary data analyze record , , criterion MOH diagnosis confirm criterion exclusion rule , patient enrol COMOESTAS protocol . Detoxification : following Visit 1 , patient undergoes detoxification accord protocol adopt classic approach . During detoxification phase , patient instruct use electronic diary ask fill electronic diary regular basis ( preferably daily least weekly ) next 6 month . Visit 2 ( 2 month detoxification ) : patient visit ; therapy successful ( patient longer overuse acute medication headache ) , MOH diagnosis patient schedule follow-up visit 4 month inform telephone contact 2 month . The patient ask keep filling electronic diary next 4 month . Visit 3 : patient visit . Study end .</detailed_description>
