	<brief_summary>This randomize , open-label , multicenter , two arm , phase II study evaluate treatment compliance change serum ferritin deferasirox granule formulation deferasirox DT formulation child adolescent age ≥ 2 &lt; 18 year enrollment transfusion-dependent anemia require chelation therapy due iron overload , demonstrate effect improve compliance iron burden . Randomization stratify age group ( 2 &lt; 10 year , 10 &lt; 18 year ) prior iron chelation therapy ( Yes/ No ) . There two study phase include 1 year core phase patient randomize 48 week treatment period either Deferasirox DT granule , optional extension phase patient receive granule 5 year . Patients demonstrate benefit granule DT core phase , and/or express wish continue optional extension phase granule , offer possibility local access new formulation ( granule FCT ) 5 year , whichever occurs first .</brief_summary>

Applicable core phase . Once core phase patient turn 18 year still consider eligible , also participation optional extension phase . Any transfusiondependent anemia associate iron overload require iron chelation therapy history transfusion approximately 20 PRBC unit treatment goal reduce iron burden ( 300mL PRBC = 1 unit adult whereas 4 ml/kg PRBC consider 1 unit child ) .
