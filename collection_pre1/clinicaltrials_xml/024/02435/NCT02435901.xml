	<brief_title>HSCT For Patients With High Risk Hemoglobinopathies Using Reduced Intensity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard myeloablative regimen toxic non-hematopoietic tissue associate treatment relate mortality morbidity ( TRM ) . Preparative regimen myeloablative associate greatly decrease incidence TRM . In addition provide less toxic regimen , reduce intensity chemotherapy preparative regimen also remain immunosuppressive enough allow donor engraftment . Recent report non-myeloablative regimen result engraftment allogeneic stem cell hematological malignancy raise possibility condition regimen might useful achieve engraftment non hematological disorder . In effort achieve stable engraftment suitable donor stem cell source minimize toxicity investigator develop new reduce intensity condition regimen high risk hemoglobinopathy main aim significantly suppress recipient 's immune system facilitate engraftment . Non-myeloablative reduced-intensity immunosuppressive preparative regimen achieve stable , mixed chimerism engraftment successful allogeneic bone marrow transplant .</detailed_description>
