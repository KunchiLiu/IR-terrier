	<detailed_description>General Approach : This study employ randomize , control design use outcomes two separate post-tests , one first teach session one 4 week second intervention . Design The investigator attempt find whether combination basic science education use 1-hour additive microskills- building method along compare/ contrast model versus 1-hour traditional case-based format would improve performance visual recognition test hematology question . A final test 4 week cross-over two group also help investigator analyze whether order exposure teach method would impact final performance . Sampling , include sample size statistical power : Sample size 40-50 resident physician meet inclusion criterion study . There enough data literature effectively determine power , use convenience sample large feasible group ( around 40 ) . Collection data : Data collect excel spreadsheet permanently de-identified spreadsheet ; keep password-protected site . Information management analysis software : Data enter password protect excel spreadsheet study participant assign unique identifier code use link data . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS version 20 . Data entry , edit management , include handle data collection form , different version data , data storage disposition : Paper survey test collect , record lock ; destroy 2 year termination study . A paired t-test use compare two sample mean significance . Quality Control / Assurance : Pretest post-tests check gold standard , hospital board-certified hematopathologist , check quality slide . Bias data collection , measurement analysis : Given small number participant expect , Type 1 error ( failure detect difference group one exist ) possible , study possibly underpowered .</detailed_description>
