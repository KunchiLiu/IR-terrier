	<brief_summary>Limiting brain death-induced organ injury systemic anti- inflammatory medical management allow improvement quality transplant organ , result , clinical improvement post-transplant outcome represent decrease incidence delay graft function ( DGF ) transplantation . The specifc aim evaluate effect C1INH ( CINRYZE ) donor pre-treatment strategy decrease systemic inflammation decrease incidence DGF Expanded Criteria Donors ( ECD ) , currently identify donor Kidney Donor Profile Index ( KDPI ) 85 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CINRYZE Donor Pre-treatment Strategy Kidney Recipients KDPI &gt; 85 % Organs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , single-center double-blinded study . Donor Pre-treatment Strategy : The main objective identify low dose allow least 80 % decrease activity classic pathway Mannose-Binding Lectin ( MBL ) pathway complement . The main objective parallel observation non-human primate animal receive kidney donor activity classic MBL pathways complement reduce least 50 % use C1 inhibitor display mild delay graft function transplantation . This trial specifically design evaluate beneficial effect C1INH kidney high rate delay graft function ( donor meet criterion expand criterion kidney ) . The nomenclature Expanded Criteria Donors ( ECD ) donor replace use Kidney Donor Profile Index ( KDPI ) . Kidneys KDPI 85 % consider equivalent old nomenclature ECD donor . The selection potential donor part study limit population donor KDPI 85 % . Participation group randomly assign . C1INH vehicle treatment administer within 6 hour brain death declaration . A total 36 subject divide 4 group : Group 1 : Control group : standard donor management + vehicle treatment ( n=9 ) Group 2 : Standard donor management + C1INH dose 200 U/Kg IV single dose ( n=9 ) Group 3 : Standard donor management + C1INH dose 500 U/Kg IV single dose ( n=9 ) Group 4 : Standard donor management + C1INH dose 200 units/kg IV single dose heparin 20 units/kg/h IV maintenance organ recovery ( n=9 ) . ( Heparin glycosaminoglycans show profound effect regulation complement activity vitro vivo combine C1INH . For purpose , C1INH 200 units/kg C1INH combination heparin use potentially reduce cost intervention . Based preliminary data obtain animal model , heparin dose 20units/kg administer combination C1INH . This dose represent approximately 0.25 units/ml , test minimally alter partial thromboplastin time combination two drug use . When drug use preclinical model ( pig ) , increase synergistic inhibition classic pathway ( approximately 50 % great ) observe compare animal C1INH use alone . )</detailed_description>
