	<brief_summary>The objective proposal determine effect resistance exercise training locomotor muscle function , exercise capacity , exertional symptom , quality life HF patient preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Resistance Training HFpEF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In randomize control pilot study resistance exercise training patient HFpEF , investigator recruit 24 HFpEF patient randomize resistance exercise training ( RT - n=12 ) resistance exercise training ( standard care control group [ CTL ] - n=12 ) . The investigator baseline follow-up measure clinical characteristic , leg muscle strength , quality life , lean muscle mass ( body composition via DXA include segmental lean mass ) , maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test ( peak VO2 , peak work , ventilatory efficiency ) , constant-load submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise test speckle track echocardiography ( exertional dyspnea fatigue match workload , cardiac output , diastolic function , leave ventricular strain , ventilation , gas exchange , locomotor muscle neural feedback ) . Participants ask make 4 separate study visit . Those randomized undergo Resistance Training expect make visit well .</detailed_description>
