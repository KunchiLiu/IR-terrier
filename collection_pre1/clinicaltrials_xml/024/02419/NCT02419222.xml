	<brief_title>Feasibility Using Prism Adaptation Treat Spatial Neglect Motor Function Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research project study design address motor cognitive change stroke , two common stroke disability . For example : two third patient report loss upper limb function major problem stroke spatial neglect occur 350,000 US right hemisphere stroke survivor annually . These two impairment treat , lead immediate impairment basic life activity , long term functional disability , increase risk fall increase healthcare cost . The literature display many strong research study trialed use multiple treatment approach remediate spatial neglect , include prism adaptation treatment ( PAT ) , result positive result . Similar finding result treatment study attempt remediate upper extremity ( UE ) . However , group patient test study ( spatial neglect UE dysfunction ) one stroke past medical history unremarkable . Rehabilitation professional help client type stroke achieve improve quality life help increase independence remediate impairment . In addition , professional need know effect PAT stroke survivor multiple lesion patient commonly treat clinical setting . Also , investigate whether use PAT , promise easy administer treatment , remediate spatial neglect also increase spontaneous UE movement limb affect stroke influence motor-intentional aiming error . Thus , pilot research proposal , researcher intend first investigate feasibility two week treatment stroke survivor multiple lesion second verify PAT improve spatial neglect jointly increase spontaneous movement UE .</detailed_description>
