	<detailed_description>Tumor vaccine represent promise area clinical investigation solid tumor base evidence clinical activity minimal toxicity . The underlying hypothesis research immunization tumor neoantigens effectively require elicit antigen-reactive T cell capable recognize eliminate cancer . Moreover , quantitative qualitative improvement CD8 immunity necessary ( sufficient ) clinical response improve survival . The goal study build prior clinical trial result melanoma study immune response tumor neoantigens patient stage 1 NSCLC .</detailed_description>
