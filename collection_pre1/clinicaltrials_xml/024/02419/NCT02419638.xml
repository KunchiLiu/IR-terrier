	<detailed_description>Primary objective To compare two commonly use MS medication , IFN β-1a subcutaneous three time per week ( Rebif ) oral twice daily dimethyl fumarate ( Tecfidera ) , mean number new enlarge T2 lesion 6 month adult relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis prescribe medication receive 6 month MRI scan standard care . Key secondary objective To compare Rebif vs. Tecfidera reduce T2 lesion volume , number T1 black hole , gadolinium-enhancing lesion , brain parenchymal fraction , brain white matter fraction brain gray matter fraction 6 month MRI . Other secondary objective - To compare two treatment follow clinical efficacy measure routinely obtain part clinical practice : Expanded disability status score ( EDSS ) , ambulation index ( AI ) , disease step number relapse . In addition obtain MSFC-4 , addition AI routinely do , include symbol digit modality test ( SDMT ) , low contrast visual acuity , 9 hole peg test . - To compare adherence two treatment use adherence question . Tertiary objective - To compare two treatment optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) visual acuity measure . - To compare follow patient report outcome : MSQOL-54 ( MSQOL54 ) , Modified MOS Social Support Survey ( MSSS ) , Modified Fatigue Impact Scale ( MFIS ) , Center Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) . - To compare cognitive function use brief repeatable battery neuropsychological test Multiple Sclerosis ( BRB ) include follow cognitive measure : Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( SDMT ) , Selective Reminding Test ( SRT ) , 10/36 Spatial Recall Test ( 10/36 ) , Controlled Oral Word Association Test ( COWAT ) . - To compare follow Pharmacoeconomic outcome : Healthcare Utilization Costs , QUALY , Unscheduled visit ( office , ER , hospital ) , out-of-pocket expense ( e.g. , durable medical equipment , copays ) , Work Productivity Activity Impairment ( WPAI ) , Treatment satisfaction questionnaire ( Treatment Satisfaction Medication Questionnaire ( TSQM ) ) Design : The study single center , 6-month , randomize , parallel-group , single blind study compare two FDA approve treatment MS ( Rebif Tecfidera ) adults relapsing-remitting MS. 120 subject treat medication ( total 240 patient ) . Randomization ensure balance patient group prevent bias . Patients prescribed medication treat physician follow patient open fashion part standard care MS include obtain MRI image 6 month . At 6 month , patient neurologic exam independent examine physician administration questionaires study staff blind treatment . Methods : Relapsing-remitting patient begin medication deem suitable treatment Rebif Tecfidera part standard care MS explain nature study , inform consent obtain . They undergo baseline visit randomize one two treatment . Blood sample biomarker study collect baseline visit 6 month . MRI obtain prior therapy 6 month part standard care . Following completion 6 month study period , subject able continue either two treatment switch another agent accord preference follow discussion treat MS neurologist . Subjects discontinue treatment prior 6 month period free begin another therapy . Upon discontinuation treatment , subject complete end study ( EOS ) visit soon possible follow duration 6-month treatment phase .</detailed_description>
