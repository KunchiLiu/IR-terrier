Exclusion criterion : Patient may attend protocol accord investigator opinion . Pregnancy lactate . Isolated prolactin produce tumour . Overproduction gonadotropin . Carcinoids ie ectopic corticotrophin realise factor ( CRF ) production . Known suspect allergy trial product relate product . Controls : Adult patient Thyroid associate ophthalmopathy ( TAO ) iv steroid infusion ( part another study see protocol ) - Study variable : Tumour detection , Tracer uptake Standardised uptake value ( SUV ) max ( SUVmax ) , SUV hotspot SUV mean region interest ( ROIs ) Time schedule : Recruitment patient 2015-2017 .

	<detailed_description>Background The common cause pituitary insufficiency pituitary adenoma ( PA ) . PA may divide hormone produce PAs non-functioning PAs ( NFPA ) . Normal pituitary tissue , well tissue PAs , express somatostatin receptor ( sst ) . Five subtypes sst receptor characterize . Magnetic resonance tomography ( MRI ) present anatomy , vivo diagnostics somatostatin receptor scintigraphy ( SRS ) position emission tomography ( PET ) reflect functional property tissue . The SRS earlier evaluate diagnostics pituitary disease low discriminative ability differ tumor tissue normal pituitary tissue even though secretory tumor NFPA see . The superiority PET diagnostics compare SRS base higher spatial resolution high tumor background ratio . Therefore large interest study Gallium 68 DOTATOC ( Ga-PET ) small tumour exhibit sst , pituitary , high resolution essential discriminate normal tissue evaluate residual tumor tissue postoperatively . Aim project To evaluate Ga-PET management pituitary tumor seek answer follow question : 1 . Is method value primary diagnostics PAs ? Does Ga-PET contribute functional information give conventional MRI ? 2 . Is method value follow-up , detection residual tumor tissue , increase possibility differ scar tissue true tumor ? 3 . Can relapse PA detect earlier Ga-PET conventional MRI ? 4 . Are sub-groups easier detect others ? ? 5 . Can pathological-anatomical finding immunochemical expression sst correlate PET finding ? 6 . Can treatment somatostatin analogue design PET investigation sst analysis ? Method The aim recruit 10 patient acromegaly ( GH-producing PA ) , 10 patient Cushing 's disease ( ACTH-producing PA ) , 5 patient TSH-producing PA ( TSHoma ) 20 patient NFPA Ga-PET pituitary surgery . In Cushing patient , TSHomas NFPA Ga-PET also dome 3 year postoperatively detect recurrence . At surgery , pituitary tissue take investigate hormonal expression , sst molecular genetic study . At PET occasion blood specimens patient collected future analysis . They keep freezer . If difficulty separate Ga-Pet up-take tumor normal pituitary tissue tumor expression may enhance somatostatin injection Ga-PET suppress normal tissue . The pituitary PET pituitary tumour patient compare pituitary patient thyroid associate tumour perform PET accord similar protocol Another study Significance This study pilot study . Ga-PET use pituitary tumor know study patient gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor pituitary see GA-PET . This `` proof concept '' . It address clinical problem management pituitary tumor . If question address study answer advantage PET , PET may routine investigation patient may avoid invasive procedure repeat MRI . In addition , patient may better information regard cure . If , treatment may tailor sst receptor expression . This great importance patient health care system .</detailed_description>
