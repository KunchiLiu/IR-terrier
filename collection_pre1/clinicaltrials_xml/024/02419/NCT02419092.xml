	<brief_summary>UPDATED May 2016 : Originally study design include investigation effect bioactive compound resveratrol compare placebo tablet CPAP treatment . Due few subject OSA estimate pre-study , therefore , difficulty recruit process investigator find necessary descale study design . Hence , discontinue resveratrol CPAP intervention focus cross-sectional investigation metabolic change subject without OSA effect weight loss bariatric surgery inflammation , OSA severity , metabolism arterial stiffness . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disorder especially among obese individual patient type 2 diabetes . OSA associate increased morbidity mortality . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) standard treatment . Also weight loss know reduce severity OSA , especially bariatric surgery proven effective massive weight loss . The investigator hypothesize OSA via pro-inflammatory response various tissue cause low-grade inflammation ultimately induce associate co-morbidities . The investigator hypothesize massive weight loss bariatric surgery beneficial effect severity OSA , inflammatory status improve insulin sensitivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>UPDATED May 2016 : Originally study design include investigation effect bioactive compound resveratrol compare placebo tablet CPAP treatment . Due few subject OSA estimate pre-study , therefore , difficulty recruit process investigator find necessary descale study design . Hence , discontinue resveratrol CPAP intervention focus cross-sectional investigation metabolic change subject without OSA effect weight loss bariatric surgery inflammation , OSA severity , metabolism arterial stiffness . OSA cause insulin resistance seem aggravate obesity relate comorbidities hypertension , dyslipidemia increase risk development type 2 diabetes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . More mechanism may involve pathogenesis negative effect OSA hypoxia-induced low-grade inflammation may play central role since level inflammatory marker generally elevate OSA . The tissue responsible systemic alteration know , however , adipose tissue might good candidate since know study human adipose tissue influence systemic inflammation . Some study even describe small significant anti-inflammatory effect beneficial effect glucose metabolism follow CPAP treatment . In addition , weight loss patient OSA know reduce severity completely eliminate OSA . The purpose study primarily investigate : 1. metabolic change adipose liver tissue induce OSA order well understand OSA negatively affect whole-body metabolism 2. effect weight loss bariatric surgery systemic inflammation , metabolism severity OSA 24 subject schedule undergo bariatric surgery recruit . They screen OSA . 12 subject without OSA 12 subject OSA include examine surgery 6 month post-surgery . The investigator look change : - Inflammation-markers - Biochemical marker fat sugar-metabolism - Gene-expression adipose liver-tissue - Severity OSA - Pulse-wave velocity</detailed_description>
