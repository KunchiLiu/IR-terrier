	<criteria>adult ( age 18 70 year old ) U.S. military Veterans military service Operations Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) , Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) , New Dawn ( OND ) sustain traumatic head injury diagnose report symptom consistent chronic ( &gt; 3 month ) posttraumatic headache attribute traumatic injury sustain part military service . We focus chronic PTHA due low likelihood headache remission 3 month , disability associate chronic PTHA , high prevalence chronic versus acute PTHA Veteran population . A positive PTHA diagnosis indicate individual de novo headache onset within 3 month concussion exacerbation preexist headache symptom ( increased frequency , duration , intensity ) within 3 month traumatic injury . This consistent exist ICHDIII criterion PTHA inclusion base either preexist diagnosis chronic PTHA document Veteran 's medical record PRC/PSC provider Neurologist ( e.g. , ICD10 code G44.329 ) screen one PRC/PSC coPIs Veteran report symptoms consistent chronic PTHA never document her/his medical record .
