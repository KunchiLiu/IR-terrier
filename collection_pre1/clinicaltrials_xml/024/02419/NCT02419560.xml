	<brief_title>Optimal Dose Finding Study ABT-199 Ibrutinib MCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , study open 4 clinical site . The purpose study determine optimal dose scheme combination ibrutinib ABT-199 treatment relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) . The main criterion eligibility MCL measurable disease relapse refractory least 1 chemotherapy-containing regimen previously treat ibrutinib . This dose finding study use continual reassessment method , account toxicity efficacy combination agent , determine optimal combination approve treatment ibrutinib investigational agent ABT-199 . This study accrue patient two stage . In initial stage , subject accrue dose cohort increase dosage ABT-199 combination ibrutinib . The modeling initiate 1 subject experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . During model stage , treatment assignment make base model prediction . Subjects remain treatment progression unacceptable toxicity , monitor safety treatment interval . Safety evaluate incidence adverse event number discontinuation due AEs . Efficacy endpoint include Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) , Complete Response Rate ( CRR ) , minimal residual disease response rate , survival ( PFS OS ) . The study also include exploratory analysis gene expression pattern subject progress treatment .</detailed_description>
