	<brief_summary>Introduction : Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) cytokine pro-inflammatory effect immune system . In acute MI IL-6 level rapidly increase response ischemia inflammation . Tocilizumab humanize monoclonal antibody interleukin-6 receptor ( IL-6R ) . The use tocilizumab within first 24 hour admission acute MI could reduce 30 day mortality . Methods : This randomize , placebo control trial assign subject within 24 hour admission treatment either 162 mg tocilizumab subcutaneously placebo addition usual pharmacologic interventional standard care acute MI ( ST segment elevation MI non-ST segment elevation MI ) . Outcomes : The primary outcome difference 30 day ( plus/minus 5 day ) occurrence major adverse cardiac event ( define later protocol ) placebo Tocilizumab treat group . Secondary outcome assess include length hospitalization , readmission rate day 30 , CRP level 0 hour , 24 hour , 48 hour , 30 day follow treatment , safety Tocilizumab focus rate know side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) cytokine pro-inflammatory effect immune system . Cytokines broad loose category small protein ( ~5-20 kDa ) important cell signal - release cell affect behavior cell , sometimes release cell . IL-6 important mediator fever acute phase response . IL-6 responsible stimulate acute phase protein synthesis well production neutrophil bone marrow . The acute-phase response detectable change acute phase protein , class protein whose plasma concentration increase decrease response inflammation . IL-6 secrete T cell macrophages stimulate immune response infection trauma , especially burn tissue damage lead inflammation . Smooth muscle cell tunica medium many blood vessel also produce IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokine . IL-6 capable cross blood-brain barrier trigger production Prostaglandin E2 hypothalamus , thereby change body 's temperature set point . In muscle fatty tissue , IL-6 stimulate energy mobilization lead increase body temperature . IL-6 secrete macrophage response specific microbial molecule , refer pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( PAMPs ) . IL-6 also produce adipocytes think reason obese individual higher endogenous level CRP . IL-6 signal cell-surface type I cytokine receptor complex consist ligand-binding IL-6Rα chain ( CD126 ) signal-transducing component gp130 ( also call CD130 ) . CD130 common signal transducer several cytokine expression CD126 restrict certain tissue . As IL-6 interacts receptor , trigger gp130 IL-6R protein form complex , thus activate receptor . These complex bring together intracellular region gp130 initiate signal transduction cascade certain transcription factor . Acute Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) occur myocardial ischemia , diminish blood supply heart muscle , exceed critical threshold overwhelms myocardial cellular repair mechanism design maintain normal function . Ischemia critical threshold level extend period result irreversible myocardial cell damage death . A common clinical diagnostic classification scheme base electrocardiographic finding mean distinguish two type acute MI , one mark ST elevation ( STEMI ) one ( NSTEMI ) . In acute MI IL-6 level rapidly increase response ischemia inflammation . In one study , plasma IL-6 level increase sample point admission discharge patient acute MI compare IL-6 level control . Cardiac catheterization influence plasma IL-6 level . In another study , patient acute MI demonstrate peak IL-6 level day 1 2 decline rapidly low , although normalize , level hospitalization 6 12 week . It also demonstrate elevated level IL-6 associate bad outcome acute MI . In one study elevate IL-6 level day 1 day 30 independent predictor adverse event . In another study , univariante analysis , baseline IL-6 related death recurrent non-fatal acute coronary syndrome . Another study demonstrate significant correlation increase IL-6 level impair leave ventricle systolic diastolic function supportive role IL-6 post-infarction cardiac damage . This group also demonstrate increased level IL-6 acute MI independent predictor leave ventricle systolic diastolic dysfunction 6 month MI .</detailed_description>
