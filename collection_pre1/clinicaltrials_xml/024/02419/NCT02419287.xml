	<brief_title>Pilot Study Crizotinib Relapsed ALK+ Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Rationale Crizotinib selective ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor c-Met/HGFR ALK receptor tyrosine kinases oncogenic variant ( eg . c-Met/HGFR mutation NPM-ALK fusion protein ) . Consistent mechanism action , Crizotinib inhibit phosphorylation c-Met/HGFR NPM-ALK kinase target dependent function tumour cell vitro vivo . This compound clinically evaluate oncology indication c-Met/HGFR NPM-ALK dysregulated include , limited renal , lung , gastric , brain , prostate , head , neck cancer , multiple myeloma , select lymphoma . Crizotinib demonstrate preclinical antitumour activity , include mark cytoreduction , several tumour model express activated c-Met/HGFR NPM-ALK , support rationale study clinical trial . Collective PK/PD model efficacy data demonstrate : 1. near complete inhibition ( free plasma IC90 ) c-Met/HGFR activity entire dosing interval necessary achieve robust antitumour effect , demonstrate several year ago imatinib ; 2. target efficacious free plasma concentration range determine 8.1 12.8 nM ( 3.7 5.8 ng/mL ) . The project efficacious dose human estimate 70 100 mg daily . Additional safety efficacy data present 2010 ASCO meeting ( Tan et al. , Bang et al . ) confirm data : plasma concentration exceed efficacious level obtain patient receive least 100 mg/day crizotinib ; addition objective tumour regression observe &gt; 50 % 82 advanced lung cancer patient whose tumour positive EML4/ALK fusion . Therefore treatment ALK+ lymphomas crizotinib represent rational attempt treat human cancer inactivation oncogenic mechanism . When administer 11 patient affect relapsed resistant ALK+ lymphoma , crizotinib obtain Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) 10/11 ( 91 % ) include 9 Complete Responses ( CR , 82 % ) 1 Partial Response . Disease status late follow-up ( June 2013 ) follow : 4 CR ( month 17+ , 26+ , 31+ , 36+ ) 3 death due progression ; 1 patient CR crizotinib receive alloBMT 2 patient ( treat post alloBMT ) still CR stop crizotinib ; 1 patient CR brentuximab . Progression Free Survival ( PSF ) Overall Survival rate 3 year 63.6 % 72.7 % . Crizotinib exert potent antitumor activity advance ALK+ lymphoma produce durable response population heavily pre-treated patient . In addition study demonstrate PCR-based detection NPM-ALK fusion peripheral blood may effective method monitor disease response progression . Although crizotinib show activity , relapse occur typically within 5 month start treatment support mutation like I1171N . Objectives Primary Define objective response rate ( ORR ) duration subject ALK+ lymphoma resistant refractory standard cytotoxic treatment , accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . Secondary - Define progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) ALK+ lymphoma patient treat crizotinib , resistant refractory standard cytotoxic treatment . Determine toxicity profile crizotinib ALK+ lymphoma patient resistant refractory standard cytotoxic treatment . - Determine Quality Life ( QoL ) population patient use EORTC - C30 Quality Life questionnaire . - Study molecular mechanism resistance crizotinib . Study design This phase II study open 12 eligible patient anaplastic large cell lymphoma confirm ALK rearrangement . Enrollment start February 2015 last 24 month . All patient must pretreated least one line standard cytotoxic chemotherapy must demonstrate progression ( regardless initial response ) last treatment . Subject selection Before clinical procedure , patient sign Informed Consent . Every patient include protocol respect inclusion/exclusion criterion . Study procedure The study begin screen period ass eligibility , include 28 day prior first dose crizotinib . The treatment period begin Day 1 Cycle 1 . Assessments tumor response perform 1 month , 2 month ( Q-RT-PCR NPM/ALK ) , 3 month every 12 week , start first day treatment crizotinib . After 1 year treatment , assessment collect every six month . From begin third year , assessment perform yearly till end study . Clinical , laboratory assessment , Quantitative Real-Time PCR ( Q-RT-PCR ) tumor image perform described Appendix 1 . Treatment continue patient experience unacceptable toxicity progressive disease ( PD ) , start new anti-cancer therapy dy . When patient discontinues study treatment EOT visit must perform within 7 day last dose crizotinib . Patients contact safety follow-up 30 day last dose crizotinib . During follow phase , patient contact year obtain information pertain survival status death , loss follow-up , withdrawal consent survival follow-up , end study . Patients need visit clinic survival follow-up . Study Treatment Patients receive crizotinib dose 250 mg BID administer orally . Crizotinib take approximately time day . In case toxicity , possible proceed dose reduction temporary interruption crizotinib accord attach table ( Appendix 2 ) . No dose escalation schedule . The metabolism crizotinib predominantly mediate CYP3A isozymes human liver microsomes hepatocytes . Co-administration drug CYP3A inhibitor inducer may change plasma concentration crizotinib human . Concomitant use potent CYP3A inhibitor inducer allow .</detailed_description>
