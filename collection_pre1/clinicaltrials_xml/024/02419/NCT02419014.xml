	<detailed_description>Restless Legs Syndrome ( RLS ) chronic neurologic disease cause painful distress dysesthesias low extremity night affect sleep quality greatly influence general overall health . Leading theory cause RLS symptom point deficiency central nervous system dopamine level . Cranial Electrical Stimulation ( CES ) therapy show affect activity dopaminergic region brain . The purpose study assess feasibility efficacy CES therapy management symptom RLS . The overall study design use mixed method . The specific aim experimental analysis ( 1 ) determine feasibility implementation CES treatment regimen population military beneficiary RLS monitoring level interest study , recruitment time , attrition rate , adherence study protocol ; ( 2 ) gather preliminary data use CES compare difference RLS symptom severity quality life individual randomize one three study group : usual care group , inactive ( sham ) device group , active CES device group . Because personal impact live RLS explore fully publish literature , third aim ( 3 ) describe experience individual cop chronic symptom RLS impact disorder quality life . Measurements RLS symptom severity quality life collect period 8 week group difference time analyze use mixed linear model . Qualitative interview data analyze use descriptive phenomenological method . Findings study inform design implementation large study establish effectiveness CES RLS symptom . Qualitative finding provide much need information priority future research clinical management base patient ' perspective . The ultimate goal research identify evaluate comparative effectiveness non-pharmacological treatment RLS symptom management .</detailed_description>
