	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND One common feature human movement variability across multiple repetition rhythmic task ( 1 ) . In human , many periodic signal , gait , heartbeat , respiratory neuronal activity characterize temporal complexity , fluctuate complex manner time . Although fluctuation cycle could appear vary randomly , without apparent correlation cycle , healthy system possess memory precede value series display complex temporal structure . In order ass variability physiological time series , several mathematical method use . On one hand , classical mathematical method , usually apply short time series ( ten data point ) , quantify fluctuation magnitude set value independently order distribution , compute standard deviation ( SD ) coefficient variation ( CV ) . On hand , complex mathematical method , apply long time series ( ≥512 cycle ) , use assess fluctuation dynamic time ( 3 ) . These latter method demonstrate variability numerous physiological signal ( cardiac respiratory rhythm locomotor activity e.g . ) exhibit long-range autocorrelations , whereby statistical inter-dependency cycle span large number cycle ( 14 ) . This temporal organization variability thus intrinsic property within numerous biological system . Moreover , could provide insight neurophysiological organization regulation system ( 32 ) . Recent study claim fluctuation , include optimal range , would represent underlie physiologic capability make flexible adaptation everyday stress place human body ( 32 ) . Therefore , presence temporal dynamic think critical marker health breakdown index pathological condition ( 18 , 25 , 32 ) . In human heart rate instance , deviation optimum variability either direction randomness ( atrial fibrillation e.g . ) over-regularity ( congestive heart failure e.g . ) indicate loss adaptive capability system ( 9 , 32 ) . Alongside , central nervous system diseases influence variability , especially , gait . Indeed , neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson Huntington diseases characterize , among others , modification walk variability ( observed breakdown long-range autocorrelations ) high risk fall . Although origin long-range autocorrelation remain unknown , breakdown disease suggest central control mechanism ( 8 , 11 , 13 , 16 , 17 , 36 ) . RESEARCH PROJECT Affecting 1 % population age 60 , Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) one common neurodegenerative disorder . PD progressive nature , patient face increased difficulty activity daily live various aspect mobility gait , transfer , balance , posture . Ultimately , lead decrease independence , inactivity , social isolation , result reduce quality life . Consequently , improvement locomotion one important aim management PD . The management PD traditionally center drug therapy , levodopa view `` gold standard '' treatment . However , even optimal medical management , parkinsonian patient experience deterioration body function , daily activity participation . For reason , support increase inclusion rehabilitation therapy adjuvant pharmacological neurosurgical treatment . Indeed , regular physical activity slow progression decrease fall risk . Moreover , exercise demonstrate effectiveness preservation functional ability prevention complication ( cardiovascular , osteoporosis , … ) . Until , study include analysis variability functional assessment patient present neurological disease , PD . Yet , walk disorder fall represent important cost society also sizeable individual risk morbi/mortality . An appropriate rehabilitation program allow reduction risk cost result disorder . The investigator hypothesize analysis walk variability could useful clinical tool assessment fall risk assessment tool therapeutic effectiveness ( medication and/or physical exercise ) PD . Therefore , aim study ( 1 ) ass influence physical exercise human walk variability ( 2 ) study potential correlation walk ability neurological impairment parkinsonian patient . Patients The investigator recruit 50 patient idiopathic Parkinson 's disease department Neurology Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc ( Brussels , Belgium ) The study approve ethic committee . All patient give inform write consent study . Eligibility criterion : diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson ( accord Brain Bank criterion United Kingdom Parkinson 's Disease Society ) , disease severity ( accord modify Hoehn &amp; Yahr stag I IV ) , absence dementia ( Minimal Mini Mental State Examination score 24 high ) , stable drug usage last 4 week adequate vision hearing , achieve use corrective lens and/or hear aid require . Patients exclude severe co-morbidity , neurological problem , acute medical problem ( e.g . MI , diabetes ) joint problem affect mobility , unpredictable `` Off '' -periods ( score &gt; 2 , MDS-UPDRS item 4.5 ) . Procedure The present study control , randomize , single blind clinical study crossover design . The control group change usual physical activity whereas intervention group benefit physical exercise program . This latter include 30 session circuit-group train 60 min ( twice week ) spread 15 week . Then , two group cross . According recent guideline , program include specific work balance , posture , gait , fitness , dual task stretch . All session perform adequate intensity ( i.e . 60-80 % predict maximal heart rate ) . At least 512 cycle record ( high sampling rate ( 512 Hz ) ) treadmill self-selected comfortable speed use unidimensional accelerometer tap right lateral malleolus . Functional assessment base 3 domain International Classification Functioning , Disability Health ( ICF ) Patients assess intervention ( T0 ) 15 ( T1 ) , 30 ( T2 ) , 45 ( T3 ) 60 week ( T4 ) among 3 ICF domain : Impairments assess MDS-UPDRS , instrument gait analysis ( kinematic , kinetic , electromyographic energetic ) ( 18 ) , 6 minute walk distance , 10 meter walk test , ABC-Scale BESTest ( include Functional Reach Test , Push &amp; Release Get Up &amp; Go test ) . Activities , participation quality life evaluate Impact Participation Autonomy Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) fall diary . Walking variability analysis Revolution time variability appreciate classical complex mathematical method . Classical mathematical method ( standard deviation , coefficient variation ) allow evaluate fluctuation magnitude , complex mathematical method ( long-range autocorrelations ) assess dynamic fluctuation time ( 3 ) . The presence long-range autocorrelations evaluate use integrated approach propose Rangarajan Ding validate Crevecoeur et al . context physiological time series . These method describe great detail elsewhere . Briefly , Hurst exponent ( H ) calculate use rescaled range analysis α exponent evaluate use power spectral density time series . For time series , method apply sequence 512 consecutive gait stride . In theory , exponent H α asymptotically related relation H. Hence , integrate approach consist separately compute H α , verify two parameter consistent equation d=H- ( 1+α ) /2=0 . A value ≤ 0.10 consider acceptable since asymptotic parameter evaluate finite time series . In summary , follow three condition must satisfy conclude presence long-range autocorrelations : H &gt; 0.5 ; α significantly different 0 low 1 ; ≤ 0.10 When inconsistency appear H α , investigator use randomly shuffle surrogate data test reject null hypothesis series investigation temporal structure ( i.e . uncorrelated random process ) . PERSPECTIVES By study influence physical exercise human walk variability potential correlation walk ability neurological impairment parkinsonian patient , investigator hope demonstrate analysis walk variability could use clinical tool assessment fall risk assessment tool therapeutic effectiveness ( medication and/or physical exercise ) PD .</detailed_description>
