	<brief_summary>Hepatitis E virus single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus genome approximately 7.2kb length . The HEV genome cap 5 ' end follow small untranslated region 27 nucleotide polyadenalated 3 ' end precede another UTR 65 nucleotide . HEV three open read frame : ORF1 , ORF2 ORF3 encode structural non- structural protein . ORF1 large one , approximately 5,000 nt length , locate 5 ' end encodes important protein replication process ( methyltransferase , papain-like cysteine protease , helicase , RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ) . A noncoding , hypervariable region within ORF1 display substantial genetic diversity ; region seem modulate efficiency HEV replication . Notably , difference genome size among different HEV strain confine mainly region .ORF2 locate 3 ' end , encode structural capsid proteins 660 amino acid contain three potential glycosylation site . The ORF2 protein contain multiple immunogenic site neutralize antibody direct al. , .The essential region protein immunogenicity 452aa-617aa neutralizing epitope recently show conformational .ORF3 locate two read frame encodes small phosphoprotein 123 amino acid . Its exact function yet determine , however , multiple function propose . It think interact cellular mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase extracellular kinase , promote cell survival activation intracellular signal pathway .Moreover , bind ORF3 encode protein host-specific protein seem influence pathogenesis HEV infection .A schematic draw HEV genome describe Figure 1 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General aim To identify overall subgroup‚Äêspecific HEV sero-prevalence Israel examine association HEV seropositivity putative risk factor . 3.2 Specific aim - To determine sero-prevalence Israeli healthy population . - To quantify sero-prevalence HEV infection Israeli healthy population age , gender , ethnicity , religion . - To present seroprevalence five specific group ( farmer swine veterinary , unexplained acute hepatitis , immunosuppressed transplant recipient , immunosuppressed HIV patient ) identify specific population group high risk HEV sero-prevalence . - To identify risk factor associate increase risk HEV sero-prevalence immunosuppressed transplant patient . - To identify risk factor associate increase risk HEV sero-prevalence farmer swine veterinary . - To identify molecular characteristic HEV Israel investigate similarity previously publish HEV sequence . - To identify incidence HEV seroconversion/ infection transplant recipient . ( sero-negative pre-transplanted patient test consistently HEV Ab 's HEV RNA transplantation )</detailed_description>
