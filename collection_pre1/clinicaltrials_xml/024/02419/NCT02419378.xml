	<brief_summary>Alemtuzumab active agent drug call Lemtrada® . In European Union , Lemtrada® approve treatment particular form multiple sclerosis ( call relapse remit form ) . The excellent efficacy drug justifies administration albeit high risk considerable side effect . In context , call secondary ( occur administration Lemtrada® ) autoimmune diseases particular importance . In disease immune system act structure body ; reason still unknown . Autoimmune diseases may even occur several year treatment Lemtrada® . Therefore , patient receive drug need undergo intensive long term health monitoring . This study aim elucidate mechanism cause positive negative effect Lemtrada® . The study include patient , suffer multiple sclerosis indicate treated Lemtrada® . All patient receive drug accord official recommendation .</brief_summary>
