	<detailed_description>Anal fissure ( AF ) common among child attend pediatric surgery clinic frequently associate painful defecation , stool withhold constipation affect 1 % -30 % pediatric population . Constipated child consume low fiber diet , come low socioeconomic family tend obese . The reason anal fissure develop still largely unclear , however pathogenesis point initial anal trauma cause hard stool lead anal sphincter hypertonia spasm cause local ischemia non-healing ulcer . It clear posterior anal canal affect part local anal ischemia . Current medical therapy chronic anal fissure focus alleviate two main pathology use anal sphincter relax topical ointment laxative treat associate constipation . The classical text book describe treatment AF focus increase fiber intake treat underlying constipation . Jensen et al , find treat first episode anal fissure bran effective local anesthetic steroid . The American Society Colon Rectal Surgeons practice parameter suggest increase fluid fiber ingestion , use sitz bath , necessary use stool softener safe side effect initial therapy patient anal fissure . There many recent randomize trial describe effectiveness Nitroglycerin ( NTG ) , Botulinum toxin injection topical calcium channel blocker Diltiazem ( DTZ ) adult pediatric . A systematic review available randomized trial agent show topical agent marginally well placebo [ 15 ] . Furthermore , trial demonstrate effectiveness topical agent laxatives usage either well control lactulose main agent use . In child , many recent randomize trial demonstrate superior effectiveness PEG lactulose consequently ; think treat AF PEG likely improve success rate lead persistent log-term fissure heal . Most adult pediatric RCTs demonstrate effectiveness topical agent heal AF , focus compare various topical agent placebo treat AF , however effectiveness comparison placebo never demonstrate patient place effective laxative PEG . We hypothesize replace lactulose effective laxative PEG sole agent treat AF eliminate effectiveness therefore need add topical sphincter relax agent DTZ NTG . Laxative-only treatment likely convenient cost-effective .</detailed_description>
