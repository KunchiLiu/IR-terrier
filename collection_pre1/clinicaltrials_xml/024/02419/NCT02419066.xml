	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Aim 1 : Determine level , pattern , correlate objectively measure ART adherence early advanced-stage disease , among pregnant non-pregnant individual , determine need nature intervention support early ART adherence Uganda South Africa . Outcomes include : ) average adherence , ii ) incidence 28-day period &lt; 80 % adherence , iii ) number ART interruption &gt; 72 hour ( could lead loss viral suppression ) , iv ) detectable HIV RNA &gt; 400 copies/Ml 6 12 month . Guided prior work Theory Vulnerable Populations , hypothesize incomplete adherence associate ) early-stage , asymptomatic disease , b ) pregnancy postpartum period , c ) multiple social economic factor . Individuals CD4 200-350 study order efficiently identify difference extremes early advanced disease . Aim 2 : Given know importance social network social support adherence advanced-stage disease RLS , determine extent social network cohesion , HIV serostatus disclosure within network , receipt social support explain differential ART adherence early advanced-stage disease . We hypothesize : ) compare people advanced-stage disease , people early-stage disease less cohesive social network , disclose seropositivity few network member , receive less social support ; ii ) social network cohesion , serostatus disclosure , social support associate great ART adherence ; iii ) association explain significant portion differential ART adherence early versus advanced-stage disease . Additionally , although factor well establish previously Uganda , prospective data need account secular trend related treatment expansion comparable data need South Africa . Aim 3 : We use qualitative method identify , describe explain influence ART adherence early-stage disease guide intervention development . In-depth understanding influence ART adherence among individual early-stage HIV disease inform focus need ART adherence intervention population . We conduct in-depth , adherence-focused qualitative interview ( ) 50 HIV+ men non-pregnant woman , ( b ) 50 HIV+ pregnant woman , initiate ART early-stage disease . Interviews pregnant woman may post-partum time interview . Equal number individual two group draw Uganda South Africa sit . Study Procedures Aims 1 , 2 : Upon recruitment , participant receive baseline interview phlebotomy . Women &lt; 50 year give urine pregnancy test . Participants give Wisepill device , instruct use use training procedure establish prior study group . The RA fill Wisepill device antiretroviral medication . If feasible acceptable participant , participant driven place residence global positioning system ( GPS ) mapping ( give GPS-measured distance associate clinic visit adherence ) . If available , exist GPS map data may use lieu drive participant 's place residence collect GPS coordinate . Structured interview conduct enrollment , 6 12 month . Interviews typically take place clinic . If feasible desirable , may offer home another location participant 's choosing . It explain clearly participant adequate cellular reception reliable data transmission via Wisepill device need bring Wisepill device clinic pharmacy refill emphasize . Additionally , permanently move area 60 km clinic , disenrolled study . The 6 12-month follow visit hold separately routine clinic visit avoid potential influence routine clinic attendance and/or adherence ( e.g. , easy transportation high motivation attend due study visit incentive ) . Participants may seek phone home study procedure attend schedule 6 12-month clinic visit . Individuals may also contact study team become aware technical problem Wisepill device . In event , study team try reach participant phone , unable , may go participant 's house assess technical difficulty . As noted , participant see baseline , 6 month , 12 month structure interview , phlebotomy ( viral load , sample storage ) , woman , pregnancy testing . Because dynamic relationship adherence HIV RNA suppression , first year critical period adherence great decline adherence usually see first year , full year observation plan determine stage disease associate adherence . Structured interview cover follow topic : demographic , health status , socio-economic status , structural barrier clinic access , food security , physical mental health , depression , cop , sexual behavior , transactional sex/intimate partner violence , beliefs/satisfaction , necessity/concerns , alcohol recreational drug use , stigma , adherence , medical mistrust/conspiracy . We also define social network . Adherence measure real-time Wisepill device , automatically capture report , daily via cellular technology , participant 's medication adherence data . A second signal transmit daily report battery level confirm device functionality . Aim 3 : We use purposeful sample systematically represent subgroup early disease adherers ( low high ) create condition in-depth qualitative analysis . Starting 6 month follow-up , identify large cohort participant , 25 pregnant early disease adherers 25 non-pregnant early disease adherers two ( Ugandan South African ) study site ( total qualitative sample size = 100 individual ) . Interviews pregnant woman may occur post-partum period . Each qualitative participant take part single , in-depth individual interview conduct research assistant train collection depth qualitative interview . Interviews target actual adherence experience behavior interviewee systematically cover range relevant topic , include : ( ) circumstance pills take ( dose behavior ) ; ( 2 ) miss dos happen ; ( 3 ) obstacle impede adherence ; ( 3 ) help adherence ( social support ) . Interviews transcribe English , need , produce qualitative data set 100 interview transcript .</detailed_description>
