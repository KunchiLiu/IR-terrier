	<brief_summary>The purpose study find safety sirolimus individual HIV infection also treat ART . The investigator want learn whether sirolimus decrease inflammation immune activation body ; whether sirolimus change level HIV participant ' blood ; sirolimus interacts ART blood . Sirolimus approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) prevent organ rejection patient age 13 year old receive kidney transplant . Sirolimus also use prevention complication stem cell transplant treatment certain kind cancer HIV-infected patient .</brief_summary>
