	<brief_title>Effects Parent-child Interactive Intervention Preventing Children 's Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children expose environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) global concern public health . Home environment , especially parental smoking , identify major expose source child . Therefore parent ' involvement become critical prevent program .

A clustered randomized control trial administer 75 parent school-aged child ( ITT ) child ( parent-child dyad ) six primary school New Taipei City , Taiwan . Parent-child dyads intervention group receive parent-child interactive program comprising three weekly group session one individual telephone counsel session , administer 4 week group session . The participant control group receive write material related tobacco information mail four time time period place intervention session . The parent-child interactive intervention develop accord Transtheoretical Model I-change Model . The main focus intervention instill knowledge regard mechanism harmful effect ETS , correct people 's perception smoke pattern lead ETS exposure home effective ineffective strategy reduce ETS , assist parent-child dyad formulate strategy maintain smoke-free home . The write material mail participant control group include information ETS adverse effect , smoke behavior cause ETS home , smoke cessation . The outcome indicator measure baseline , 8 week , 20 week . The primary outcome include child 's exposure ETS home prevention child 's ETS exposure . Children 's exposure ETS home measure parent smoke home presence child last 7 day , child 's urinary cotinine level . The final collection child 's urine perform 6 month intervention rather 3 month intervention delay receive urine cotinine measurement kit . Prevention ETS exposure measure Parent-reported preventing strategy child-reported avoid behavior . The second outcome include parent/children report knowledge attitude toward ETS , parents-reported family 's anti-ETS climate influence , children-reported self-efficacy avoid ETS exposure . Collected data analyze Chi-square test generalize estimate equation . A pre-and-posttest pilot study 10 parent-child dyad two primary school conduct study .</detailed_description>
