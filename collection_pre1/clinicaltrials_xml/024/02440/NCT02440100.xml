	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrollment study : 1 . For Part 1 Part 3 specific : Healthy female subject non childbearing potential male subject , time screening , age 18 55 year , inclusive ( Healthy define clinically relevant abnormality identify detailed medical history , full physical examination , include blood pressure pulse rate measurement , 12 lead ECG clinical laboratory test ) . 2 . For Part 2 specific : Female subject non childbearing potential male subject , time screening , age 65 85 year , inclusive . Subjects must good health determine Investigator base detailed medical history , full physical examination ( include blood pressure pulse rate measurement ) , 12 lead ECG clinical laboratory test . Subjects mild , chronic , stable disease eg , control hypertension , non insulin dependent diabetes , osteoarthritis may enrol deem medically prudent investigator . Subjects take daily prescription non prescription medication management acceptable chronic medical condition must stable dose , define non change dose 3 month prior first dose study medication plan change conduct study . 3 . Female subject non childbearing potential must meet least one follow criterion : Achieved postmenopausal status , define follow : cessation regular menses least 12 consecutive month alternative pathological physiological cause ; status may confirm serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level confirm post menopausal state ; Have undergone document hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy ; Have medically confirm ovarian failure .
