	<brief_title>Basic Care Revisited : Early Nutrition Intervention Outpatients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early screening treatment malnutrition vital . The prevalence malnutrition hospital admission slightly decrease last year . ( Halfens , 2007 ) This indicate screen intervention early course develop disease , e.g . outpatient clinic , prevent severe malnutrition decrease amount complexity care . ( Jonkers-Schuitema et al. , 2011 ; Leistra et al. , 2009 ) . Screening malnutrition nutrition intervention outpatient clinic however , daily practice . Leistra et al . ( 2009 ) show 17 % severely undernourished patient 4 % moderately undernourished patient receive form dietetic treatment outpatient clinic . Early nursing nutrition intervention study well . Aim : To investigate feasibility effectiveness screen early nursing intervention malnutrition outpatient need surgery . Design : Multicentre cluster randomize controlled trial design surgical outpatient clinic two hospital ( one academic one non-academic ) . The intervention randomly assign half outpatient clinic , patient cluster nurse , work outpatient clinic . The remain nurse patient serve control group . Nursing teams nurse work multiple team exclude . Nurses train use MUST-Screening nutrition care plan . Study population : Patients visit outpatient clinic , plan operation , one academic one non-academic hospital ( n=150 ) . Description intervention : The early nursing nutrition intervention include malnutrition screening ( outpatient clinic visit ) MUST . If patient intervention group ´at risk malnutrition´ ´malnourished´ , standardise nutrition care plan ( include nutritional drink energy protein rich meal , tailor individual patient requirement ) discuss patient nurse . Control patient receive usual care ( nutrition care plan ) . The intervention period 6 month . Outcome : Primary : Up 6 month , BMI measure three point time : 1 ) outpatient clinic , 2 ) hospitalisation , 3 ) discharge . Also , intake nutrient measure 2 day outpatient clinic visit . Average time frame patient 5 week , intervention control group . Secondary : Up 6 month , Length Stay ( LOS ) health-related quality life ( EQ-5D ) measure discharge , CQ satisfaction nutritional care &amp; care general measure outpatient clinic hospitalisation . Average time frame patient 5 week , intervention control group . To evaluate cost intervention , nurse time investment patient risk observe 30 patient per group combine average cost arrive preliminary cost usual care early nutrition intervention . To evaluate process , nurse interview ( n=6 ) collect data manner intervention change nurse care . Statistical analysis : Data analyse intention-to-treat basis . Results cluster ward level . In study subject baseline follow-up , therefore use linear mixed model repeat measurement , `` nurse '' random effect , BMI main outcome , group , time group x time interaction fix effect .</detailed_description>
