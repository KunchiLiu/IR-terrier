	<detailed_description>Amputation limb life-altering event profound physical , psychological , social implication . To address functional , vocational , recreational need , people low limb amputation ( LLA ) often provide prosthesis artificial leg . While use prosthesis allow individual achieve basic level functional mobility , absence anatomical foot ankle still impair physical performance . As result , people LLA regularly exhibit decreased walking speed , diminish endurance , restrict ability participate desire life situation . Over past three decade , increasingly sophisticated prosthetic foot design develop prosthetics industry replace amputated structure leg . Contemporary , energy store foot ( ESF ) employ advanced material unique geometric design improve walk performance endurance user . Although prosthetic limb ESF allow people LLA potential return active lifestyle , even advance ESF significantly reduce increase energy demand require walking compare conventional prosthetic foot . Commercially-available running-specific foot ( RSF ) like Össur Cheetah ( Össur , Reykjavik , Iceland ) allow people LLA participate athletic activity sport event . RSF provide significantly enhance performance , compare traditional ESF , extend length increase stiffness prosthetic keel ( forefoot ) . RSF also include heel , use run activity . Although transtibial runner RSF exhibit endurance level similar non-amputees , RSF design allow biomechanical movement provide stability need use foot walking ( level uneven terrain ) . A novel modify running-specific foot ( mRSF ) develop integrate performance RSF utility ESF . The mRSF combine run keel ( forefoot ) RSF walk heel ESF . The mRSF use walking , run , routine daily activity . Preliminary feedback mRSF suggest user experience improve overall function high satisfaction device . However , empirical evidence need support prescription prosthetic foot clinical facility . The goal study therefore evaluate endurance , walk performance , mobility , perceive exertion transtibial prosthesis user ( i.e. , study participant ) walk conventional ESF mRSF . Results compare determine mRSF provide superior performance ESF , commonly prescribe active individual LLA .</detailed_description>
