	<brief_title>Longitudinal Analysis And Sample Collection To Evaluate PML Risk Host Markers PML Risk Host Markers PML Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The underlie etiology association natalizumab therapy increase risk progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) remain unknown . It possible persistently high natalizumab level lead sustain immune-modulation suppression result increase PML risk . Since 2010 conduct three investigator initiate trial ( IITs ) center measure serum natalizumab concentration , lymphocyte alpha 4 integrin saturation , biomarkers understand association marker PML risk . A number patient participate clinical trial still infuse . These study demonstrate plasma natalizumab concentration continue rise time plateau effect yet clearly delineate . Improved drug clearance patient higher body weight describe prescribe information . We accumulate preliminary data suggest patient low body weight may higher risk PML may relate high drug concentration saturation see group . Dose extension may viable option low drug concentration ( pharmacokinetic , PK ) saturation ( pharmacodynamic , PD ) patient low body weight potentially impact PML incidence . In addition PK/PD natalizumab , host related biomarkers may allow specific PML risk stratification . Further validation biomarkers critical understanding utility .</detailed_description>
