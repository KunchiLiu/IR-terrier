	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate use SPY Elite System assess real-time tissue perfusion low extremity amputation sit develop parameter predict heal amputation time surgery . This pilot study see Spy Elite System capable record accurate measurement amputation sit allow correlation healing . If study show promise device , investigator would plan large study data would assess operating room time acquisition revision perform need base finding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Assess Use Spy Elite Assessment Amputation Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pilot study prospective cohort study consent subject require knee knee amputation . The study start 18 subject assess proof concept . If correlation identify , new proposal submit large cohort . Our hypothesis Spy Elite System help identify area poor tissue perfusion time low extremity amputation , predict future potential wound heal complication . Primary outcome variable include wound heal 30 day , intra-operative image amputation site use Spy Elite System . Secondary outcome variable include level amputation , 30-day wound healing complication , readmission rate , need revision , subject demographic co-morbidities . Subjects agree participation undergo amputation operate suite per routine . The Spy Elite System implement final wound closure prior dress placement . A single injection 10 mg Indocyanine Green administer , follow 10 ml bolus normal saline per manufacturer IFU recommendation ( Attachments B , C , D ) . Recording Spy Elite Device save analysis . Also , digital photograph surgical wound save comparison . No change operative management base Spy Elite System take place study . At subject routine 30-day follow appointment , wound assess complication , digital photograph incision save , secondary endpoint obtain . Possible correlation perfusion value Spy Elite System record wound heal analyze Investigators . The value know photo take investigator compare ischemic area normal area base collected photograph .</detailed_description>
