	<detailed_description>Nowadays Cesarean section become popular surgery worldwide consumption hospital resource continuous need decrease cost , work load medical stuff engagement . One common problem need control pain post operatively , issue increase work load pain management team increase lead patient satisfaction . ( 1,2,3 ) The presence adjuvant add conventional anesthetic medication prolong duration action decrease need frequent post-operative analgesic . ( 4,5 ) The idea add catheter place epidural catheter still quite limitation regard patient compliance , delay ambulation high cost , limitation redirect anesthetist use adjuvant single shot block prolong duration decrease need subsequent analgesic . ( 6 ) Dexamethasone prove effective adjuvant prolongation nerve block question regard proper route dose ( 7,8,9,10 ) . This study test usage dexamethasone different dos ( 4 8 mg ) either locally intravenously ( I.V . ) local anesthetic TAP ( transversus abdominis plane ) block prolong duration block decrease need post-operative analgesic .</detailed_description>
