	<brief_title>Standardized Ambulatory Neurorehabilitation Program Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic inflammatory disease central nervous system ( CNS ) common cause non-traumatic disability young adult western country . The incidence MS low childhood increase age 18 , reach peak 20 40 year ( mean age 30 year ) woman affect approximately 2-5 year earlier men . In Switzerland incidence think 4:100.000 approximately 12.500 affected patient . Despite increase therapeutic option ameliorate disease course , patient suffer persistent neurological deficit time . Neurologic symptom manifold highly variable amongst patient . They include loss vision , sensorimotor defect , impaired manual dexterity , ataxia , apraxia , gait disturbance , bladder- bowl problem , fatigue , cognitive dysfunction others , alone , combination , lead disability MS patient . Disability MS negative impact patient life 's impairing activity daily live ( ADL ) quality life ( QoL ) lead loss work need provide care . This result tremendous socioeconomic burden . Disease-modifying treatment prevent disability progression variable extent . However drug available ameliorate persistent disability MS . Therefore , exercise training well physical occupational therapy important symptomatic treatment MS . Intensive task orient circuit train show effective stroke improve gait , several ADL . Some pilot randomize control trial MS demonstrate exercise training able improve muscular strength , aerobic capacity ambulatory performance well fatigue , balance gait . Furthermore , specific therapy improve manual dexterity , coordination mobilization MS patient well . Although , far randomized trial do prove effectiveness task orient circuit training MS . Physical occupational therapy usually perform close patient home therapist different professional background non-standardized way . The investigator therefore aim develop standardized comprehensive ambulatory neurorehabilitation program , integrate task orient circuit training MS patient improve disability , ADL QoL easily adopt ambulatory hospital setting . Objective To evaluate impact standardized comprehensive ambulatory neurorehabilitation program disability patient multiple sclerosis measure performance base test upper low extremity patient record outcome measure regard function upper low extremity , activity daily live quality life . The investigator hypothesize train program improve disability , activity daily live quality live MS patient . Methods Prospective double center , randomize , cross-over study . Consecutive MS patient complain disability affect ADL and/or QoL recruit participate comprehensive ambulatory neurorehabilitation program . Afterwards baseline measurement perform patient randomize 1:1 early treatment group delay treatment group group four use seal envelope . The early treatment group start neurorehabilitation program whereas delay treatment group , patient put wait list two month . After two month , outcome measurement collect . Patients early treatment group stop neurorehabilitation program patient delayed treatment group start neurorehabilitation program two month ( `` cross-over design '' ) . Two month end program , group retested .</detailed_description>
