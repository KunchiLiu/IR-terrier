	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 , Dose Escalation , Cohort Expansion Study To Evaluate The Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics And Preliminary Efficacy Of ASN002 In Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoma And Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two part . Part A dose escalation study determine safe tolerable dose ASN002 subject relapse refractory lymphoma , advance solid tumor . Part A also characterize pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics ASN002 blood sampling . Subjects Part B enroll lymphoma subject , consist three cohort ( Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma , Follicular Lymphoma , Mantle Cell Lymphoma ) . Subjects treat high safe tolerable dose determine Part A study determine preliminary efficacy lymphoma . Subjects may continue receive ASN002 1 year absence severe side effect disease progression .</detailed_description>
