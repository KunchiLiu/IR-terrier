	<brief_summary>The iLink Study examine whether Conditional Economic Incentive ( CEI ) may effective tool improve linkage HIV treatment care follow referral antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) service mobile health clinic Cape Town , South Africa . The study examine feasibility acceptability use R300 ( approximately $ 25 April 2015 ) voucher - exchange cash upon initiation ART within 3 month - increase uptake ART among men woman live low-income area . This pilot study ( n=64 ) include randomise control trial , follow-up telephone call medical record review , in-depth interview .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>iLink ( Incentives Linkage ART ) Study : A Mixed-methods Study Improve Linkage HIV Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initiation combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) remain serious challenge globally , particularly South Africa , country large population people live HIV worldwide ( UNAIDS 2012 ) . South Africa large ART programme globally , yet half needing ART South Africa receive treatment 2011 ( Johnson 2012 ) . Early initiation ART improve treatment outcome reduce AIDS-related morbidity mortality . Recent study demonstrate secondary benefit ART prevent HIV transmission reduce viral load thus transmissibility ( Cohen et al . 2011 ; Montaner et al . 2010 ; Tanser et al . 2013 ) . Despite personal public health benefit ART , South African study show large loss follow-up stage require ART initiation : ( 1 ) initial CD4 count test return result ; ( 2 ) attend ART readiness counselling ; ( 3 ) return initiate ART ( April et al . 2009 ; Bassett et al . 2010 ; Kranzer et al . 2010 ; Larson et al . 2010 ; Losina et al . 2010 ) . Novel intervention urgently need improve linkage HIV treatment care post-diagnosis , increase ART coverage reduce AIDS-related morbidity mortality , HIV incidence . Improving ART coverage therefore priority many region world , particularly sub-Saharan Africa , AIDS remain key development challenge . Interventions base theory field behavioural economics , hybrid principle psychology economics ( Bickel et al . 1995 ) , great potential help strengthen contribution psychology improve ART outcome . Conditional economic incentive ( CEIs ) , financial incentive give upon completion outcome objectively measure ( i.e . ART initiation ) , potential leverage two theoretical principle behavioural economics improve ART initiation . First , instead completely rational accurate , decision-making view inherently bias due multitude social-cognitive affective factor play role cost-benefit analysis , emotion , personal belief , contextual factor ( Fiske &amp; Taylor 2008 ) . In word , people 's prefer outcome largely determine salient contextual need ( Operario et al . 2013 ) . Second , people tendency give great value reward present near future distant future ( phenomenon economist term temporal discounting ) therefore decision-making favour immediate reward heavily discount future outcomes . This pose challenge ART initiation future benefit ART may value less individual 's immediate need , especially individual currently perceive relatively healthy . A CEI may help overcome challenge ART initiation increase immediate benefit . A CEI may therefore help 'nudge ' individual initiate ART alter cost-benefit ratio benefit ART ( i.e . immediate financial reward future health reward ) outweigh immediate cost ART initiation , transport , time work , long wait line fear stigma . The application CEIs address HIV prevention treatment problem still infancy , successfully employ improve adherence ART ( Rosen et al . 2007 ; Sorensen et al . 2007 ; Javanbakht et al . 2010 ) , increase HIV test uptake collection HIV test result ( Thornton 2008 ) , reduce risky sexual behaviour ( Baird et al . 2012 ) . This evidence indicate small incentives-based intervention 'nudge ' individual towards adopt healthier behaviour . The propose research make significant contribution knowledge demand creation HIV treatment prevention service examine whether CEIs may also effective tool improve linkage HIV treatment care follow referral ART service . The propose research examine feasibility acceptability use CEIs increase uptake ART among men woman refer ART service . Our long-term collaborative goal utilize result pilot study prepare grant application fully-powered RCT examine whether CEIs increase ART initiation . Objectives To examine acceptability feasibility incentive intervention aim increase uptake ART among men woman refer ART ( CD4 &lt; 500 WHO stage 4 ) mobile health clinic . Acceptability - Did participant find randomization process fair acceptable ? - Was intervention incentive motivate encouraged uptake ART ? - Was incentive amount type acceptable ? - Were individual control arm discourage ART initiation felt linkage care effort reward ? - Were case patient unsatisfied disappointed consequence study ( eg . receive incentive , yet think ) ? Feasibility - Is possible recruit men woman study day refer ART ? - Is possible track individual recruit individual in-depth interview ? - Is possible implement study plan : - Did randomization process work ? - Did participant understand incentive system ? - Did participant believe would actually receive incentive ? - Did incentive delivery method work ? - What potential individual game incentive system ? Did individual find method receive money without start ART ? Potential Efficacy - Is ART initiation likely among men woman offer incentive compare men woman offer incentive ? - Is early ART initiation likely among men woman offer incentive compare men woman offer incentive ? - Does retention care ART initiation differ among men woman offer incentive compare men woman offer incentive ? - What potential incentive improve ART initiation give participant behavioural intention regard ART initiation barrier ART initiation ?</detailed_description>
