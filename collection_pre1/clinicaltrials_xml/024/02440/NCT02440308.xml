	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study use gallium-68 ( 68Ga ) -DOTA-Bombesin positron emission tomography ( PET ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) image patient prostate cancer . PET use radioactive substance call 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin , attache tumor cell specific receptor surface . The PET scanner take picture capture radioactive drug `` lighting '' attach tumor cell , may help doctor recognize difference tumor healthy prostate tissue . MRI use radio wave magnet make picture area inside body . Using 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin diagnostic procedure , PET/MRI , may allow doctor identify small tumor standard image .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate feasibility biodistribution 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin ( BAY 86-7548 68Ga-DOTA RM2 ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin intravenously ( IV ) undergo PET/MRI approximately 60 later . After completion study , patient follow 24 hour 1 week .</detailed_description>
