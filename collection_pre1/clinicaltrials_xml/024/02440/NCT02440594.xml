	<detailed_description>Despite advance assessment treatment behavioral health disorder among old adult , disorder remain inadequately diagnose manage later life . This trouble light fact behavioral health issue often serve catalyst variety negative psychosocial physical health outcome later life , include change social network functioning , physical disability morbidity , loss independence , institutionalization . Factors limit provider resource conduct frequent monitoring , variability patient preference symptom severity , patient ' lack treatment acceptance engagement , low medication adherence , formal informal social support aid , logistic issue ( e.g. , transportation , finance , etc . ) work concert influence patient identification disease management . Yet , factor difficult address manage condition use traditional mental health ( MH ) care delivery model rely primarily referral specialty care and/or face-to-face contact . Recognizing traditional MH care delivery model treatment strategy address practice- patient-level logistical issue particularly relevant behavioral health care , frequent clinical visit monitor therapeutic contact key component successful treatment patient , investigator adopt strategy deliver disease management way telephone assessment . The Behavioral Health Laboratory ( BHL ) flexible dynamic telephone-based clinical service design help identify manage behavioral health issue . The principle program include : MH key component overall physical health ; need make early MH screening , assessment , referral service part common practice ; value utilize technology access deliver MH care ; importance research- evidence-based practice . An untoward outcome effort improve rate treatment increase sometimes inappropriate use psychotropic medication . Among general population , use psychotropic medication rate psychotropic polypharmacy continue rise , increase use medication anxiety depression primary care specialty care . The rate use raise concern regard inappropriate prescribing among elderly . Results investigator ' initial program care management service PACE/PACENET cardholder support concern relate psychotropic medication prescription elderly also raise additional question off-label inappropriate prescribing . The program result indicate PACE/PACENET population mostly female mean age 78.1 year ( SD 7.0 ) , SF-12 Physical Component Score 41.6 . The average Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9 ) score antidepressant 6.1 ( 5.4 ) , statistically significant difference medication group ( F ( 2.436 ) =2.14 , p=0.12 ) ; 9 ( 6.3 % ) receive anxiolytic meet criterion anxiety disorder , significantly different medication class ( x2 ( 2 ) =1.77 , p=0.41 ) . Overall , 208 ( 47.4 % ) participant sample meet criterion mental health disorder , include 80 ( 55.9 % ) receiving anxiolytic . Thus , purpose current project evaluate impact PACE/PACENET BHL clinical program older Pennsylvanians evaluate feasibility impact enhancement current clinical program . The clinical contract service target PACE/PACENET beneficiary newly prescribe antidepressant , antipsychotic , and/or anxiolytic , , appropriate , caregiver . In order obtain representative sample PACE/PACENET enrollee , PACE/PACENET program us stratify sample method identification referral eligible beneficiary PACE/PACENET BHL Clinical Program . Stratification conduct respect two variable -- county medication type , individual randomly select stratum . Current clinical participant sample contact specifically research purpose . The research portion project relate evaluation enrol clinical program delivery evaluation enhancement current program . The PACE/PACENET BHL Research Participants : 1 . Enhanced BHL Program Participants : Upon completion initial PACE/PACENET BHL Program interview , investigator randomly select subset 2400 enrollee Enhanced BHL Program invite enrollee participate Enhanced Program . If enrollee able complete full initial BHL interview due cognitive impairment ( either identify cognitive screening caregiver report ) , caregiver may invite participate caregiver component Enhanced BHL Program , Telehealth Education Program ( TEP ) Module . 2 . BHL Program Evaluations : Participants recruit evaluation component BHL Programs ( Standard Enhanced ) fall follow category : 1 . Evaluation BHL Clinical Data : In order examine factor participant clinical sociodemographic characteristic , process care , prescription refill , use service , investigator ask 6000 enrollee permission use clinical data collect BHL interview . To accomplish component evaluation , investigator orally consent individual least begin Core interview allow use clinical data research purpose . Participants need consent use clinical data prerequisite participate clinical program . The clinical data include prescription data supply PACE/PACENET program . 2 . 3/6 Month Outcome Evaluation : In order examine long-term outcome , participant complete initial clinical interview offer participation outcome evaluation 3 6 month . Subject Recruitment Screening : 1 . BHL Clinical Data Evaluation : Following completion initial PACE/PACENET BHL clinical assessment ( i.e. , `` Core assessment '' ) , enrollees ask permission use clinical data collect BHL interview . 2 . Enhanced Program Recruitment : Following completion initial PACE/PACENET BHL clinical assessment , subset enrollee ask participate Enhanced BHL Program . Randomization Enhanced Program occur within stratum determine index medication type Core interview assessment outcome ( i.e. , clinically significant depression and/or anxiety symptom , clinically significant symptom , cognitive impairment ) . After obtain informed consent , separate simple randomization protocol follow within substratum enrollee . For substratum every participant offer participation Enhanced BHL Program . 3 . 3/6 Month Outcome Evaluation Recruitment : Following completion initial PACE/PACENET clinical assessment agreement participation Enhanced Program Standard Clinical Program , enrollees caregiver ask participate evaluation BHL program 3 6 month initial PACE/PACENET BHL clinical interview . Study Procedures : The Enhanced BHL Program : 1 . The Enhanced BHL Program : Upon completion Core interview , subset enrollee randomly select participate Enhanced BHL Program ( i.e. , Enhanced Monitoring Module Enhanced Care Management Module ) . For enrollees report clinically significant mental health symptom Enhanced Program consist Standard Monitoring Module enhance discussion continue versus discontinue medication . The Behavioral Health Provider ( BHP ) follow-up enrollee 6 week discus continue versus discontinue medication . For enrollees report clinically significant depression , anxiety , and/or pain symptom Enhanced Program consist Care Management . The model incorporate use BHP expertise mental health assessment well versed delivery algorithm-based management strategy disorder depression anxiety . The role BHP facilitate treatment provide informal psychosocial therapy , use motivational interviewing technique , manner consistent Agency Health Care Policy Research ( AHCPR ) guideline . The BHP monitor encourage patient acceptance adherence treatment recommendation support , education , motivational engagement . The BHP initiate care management enrollee respond initial treatment clinically need base initial Core interview need assessment . The BHP also use problem solve therapy assist patient . The frequency number contact individual vary ; individual typically engage 1-2 contact per month several month . Written update provide prescribe clinician , clinically indicate . In case caregiver complete initial interview endorse cognitive impairment care-recipient enrollee , random sample caregiver offer participation Enhanced BHL Telehealth Education Program ( TEP ) . TEP exist , manualized program develop validate caregiver veteran moderate severe dementia . The program consist various module seek provide education psychosocial support individual care old adult moderate severe cognitive impairment . Based response Caregiver Core Interview participant preference , BHP caregiver determine TEP module cover course TEP . If module identify relevant ( caregiver decline module ) , BHP still follow-up caregiver , offer unstructured supportive phone call . Delivering program telephone allow access education support without manage difficulty get enrollee house find supervision enrollee order attend face-to-face session . 2 . 3/6 Month Outcome Evaluation : In order evaluate individual-level outcome rate clinical improvement 3 6 month , investigator attempt collect follow-up data enrollees/caregivers complete initial PACE/PACENET BHL Clinical Program assessment . Using data extract enrollee follow-up assessment , investigator examine psychological , behavioral , cognitive symptom , physical disability , health care utilization , access community resource . Using data extract caregiver follow-up assessment , investigator able evaluate care recipient ' behavioral , psychological , cognitive symptom level physical functioning , addition caregiver burden safety concern .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . To eligible Enhanced BHL Program , inclusion criterion participate initial telephone assessment part current PACE/PACENET BHL Clinical Program . If patient complete full assessment due cognitive , hearing , speech impairment , patient may identify caregiver complete Caregiver Interview . To eligible TEP ( caregiver support group ) component Enhanced Care , enrollee must exhibit cognitive impairment ; Caregiver Interview complete , response caregiver regard enrollee 's cognition ( score 2 great `` AD8 Dementia Screening Interview '' and/or dementia diagnosis ) use indication impairment lieu enrollee 's BOMC score . 2 . Similarly , eligible BHL Program Evaluations ( i.e. , BHL Clinical Data Evaluation , 3/6 Month Outcome Evaluation ) , inclusion criterion participate initial telephone assessment part current PACE/PACENET BHL Clinical Program . As , enrollees complete initial assessment still eligible caregiver available complete Caregiver Interview . 3 . Enrollment current PACE/PACENET BHL Clinical Program . Though part research program , current program target older , communitydwelling adult ( i.e. , 65 year old ) enrol PACE/PACENET program , fill least one new prescription antidepressant , antipsychotic , and/or anxiolytic medication . The BHL program require basic ability communicate telephone ; either enrollee identify caregiver must meet criterion participation BHL Clinical Program . Exclusion criterion participation Enhanced BHL Program 3/6 Month Outcome Evaluation : 1. severe cognitive impairment ( BOMC score 14 great ) absence caregiver , and/or 2. endorsement psychosis mania initial clinical interview , and/or 3. PHQ score 25 great , and/or 4. positive drug abuse screen , and/or 5. alcohol dependence . Enrollees endorse mentioned exclusion offer assistance referral community specialtycare resource part PACE/PACENET BHL Clinical Program . Exclusion criterion caregiver participation TEP component Enhanced Care lack report cognitive impairment Caregiver interview complete .</criteria>
