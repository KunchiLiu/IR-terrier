	<brief_summary>STUDY DESIGN : This retrospective , multi-reader , multi-case , ( MRMC ) randomize reader study . OBJECTIVE : Primary : The primary objective clinical study prove user aid ClearRead CT InSight ( CRCTI ) superior unaided reader detect actionable lung nodule . Secondary : The secondary objective clinical study prove reader 's reading time significantly increase aided CRCTI . NUMBER OF SUBJECTS : Retrospective CT study approximately 300 patient include study . Approximately 100 true positive case 200 normal case . NUMBER OF READERS : A reader study least ten ( 10 ) participate radiologist ( US Board Certified ) conduct . PRIMARY ENDPOINTS : Scores give radiologist without ClearRead CT Insight record compare true status study-cases . The frequency score method ( Unaided , Aided ) tabulate LROC curve construct along sensitivity , specificity , PPV , NPV clinical action . Additionally , machine nodule detection rate false positive per patient normal case measure . PATIENT POPULATION : The study target approximately one hundred ( 100 ) patient whose CT nodules show cancer two hundred ( 200 ) normal patient . The patient population consistent national lung cancer screening protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A reader study least ten ( 10 ) participate radiologist conduct . A localized receiver operate characteristic curve use evaluate radiologist ' diagnostic performance ( term trade-off sensitivity specificity decision criterion change ) detection lung nodule lung CTs without usage ClearRead CT Insight ( CRCTI ) system . The time need review interpretation case also record . An initial ( baseline ) interpretation make radiologist base Lung CT original form . At minimum one month later , radiologist interpret image view pair CRCTI CT series : Two set CT image ( standard CADe mark process vessel suppression present either one large monitor two adjacent monitor . During baseline read radiologist mark location actionable nodule assign score . The radiologist also indicate recommend method follow-up ( Contrast CT , PET-CT , CT Follow-up , Biopsy ) . During second reading session ( concurrent read ) , radiologist present standard appear CT computer-aided detection ( CADe ) mark place vessel suppressed slice vessel suppress view ( right image ) . The second image , vessel suppress , grayed radiologist move mouse second panel . The radiologist mark location . These may may correspond location CAD marker . As , radiologist assign level suspicious mark indicate need , , additional diagnostic action ( CT Follow-up , Contrast CT , PET-CT , Biopsy ) . Based level suspicion nodule associate likelihood rating , LROC curve construct baseline concurrent read significance difference calculate . The recommendation action ( CT Follow-up , Contrast CT , PET-CT , Biopsy ) use calculate sensitivity specificity , PPV NPV . Number types case : Retrospective lung CT image series approximately 300 patient include study . Approximately one hundred ( 100 ) patient pathology confirm cancer approximately two hundred ( 200 ) patient CTs associate normal patient . Also include nodule image actionable nodule acted time , detect act base subsequent CT . These prior image nodule identify location `` current '' image confirm radiologist expert panel ( use majority three decision criterion ) . The selected sample , randomly select large pool CT case enrich follow way : 1 . Lung nodule ( cancer study ) tumor size T1a ( 20 mm less ) . The proportion nodules 20 mm less may increase since investigator expect major impact software . 2 . Non-Solid ( ground glass ) nodules added sample ( base availability ) determine performance system non-solid nodule . For group , sufficient case , investigator may include benign ( non-malignant ) non-solid nodule . 3 . In project , investigator perform Machine Test ClearRead CT Insight algorithm follow reader performance evaluation study . Riverain provide system configure operating point set use reader study configuration `` open '' system use machine test FROC generation . Arm 1 : baseline read ( secondary content ) Arm 2 : concurrent , CAD augment read . 1. st Arm : Do baseline ( measure time , reader score region accord action suspiciousness ) - mark location concern 2. nd Arm : Concurrent read ( measure time , reader score region accord action suspiciousness ) - mark location concern The primary study hypothesis adjunctive use ClearRead CT Insight superior use standard lung CT image alone , measure area LROC curve . STATISTICAL ANALYSES Accuracy To evaluate hypothesis superiority term improvement accuracy ClearRead CT Insight vs. unaided , mixed effect model ( DBM ) implement ( similar model outline Dorfman , Berbaum Metz , 1997 ) , variance component include account reader , case , reader case , reader modality , case modality reader case modality . However , anticipate three-way interaction inestimable subsequently drop statistical model . Specifically , hypothesis test superiority ClearRead CT Insight vs. unaided : H0 : AUCunaided - AUCClearRead CT Insight ≥ 0.0 vs. HA : AUCunaided - AUCClearRead CT Insight &lt; 0 The AUC LROC primary endpoint evaluate accuracy test interest two-sided 95 % confidence interval effect modality ( i.e . ClearRead CT Insight minus unaided ) . Significance conclude upper bound two-sided 95 % confidence interval include zero . If null hypothesis ( H0 ) reject , alternative hypothesis ( HA ) accept superiority use ClearRead CT Insight system establish . Time The second co-primary objective evaluate reduction time spend per image ClearRead CT Insight vs. unaided . Specifically , hypothesis test superiority ClearRead CT Insight vs. unaided : H0= Tunaided - TClearRead CT Insight ≤ 0 vs. HA= Tunaided - TClearRead CT Insight &gt; 0 To evaluate hypothesis non-inferiority term improve read time ClearRead CT Insight vs. unaided , mixed effect model implement ( similar model outline Dorfman , Berbaum Metz , 1992 ) , variance component include account reader , case , reader case , reader modality , case modality reader case modality . However , anticipate three-way interaction inestimable subsequently drop statistical model . The read time test use two-sided 95 % confidence interval effect modality ( i.e . ClearRead minus unaided ) . Significance conclude upper bound two-sided 95 % confidence interval include zero . With either analysis , use mixed model could modify employ bootstrap sample approach model assumption DBM method violate . The upper 95 % confidence limit difference area curve would calculate use 10,000 bootstrap MultiReader MultiCase ( MRMC ) ROC method . POWER AND SAMPLE SIZE The power detect difference AUC LROC curve propose statistical analysis use current design baseline , i.e . 300 case , correspond image read 10 reader , assess simulation study . Specifically , model outline used simulate 500 datasets across range effect size , power define proportion datasets yield significant p-value test fixed effect modality . The method Dorfman , Berbaum Metz , 1992 ( DBM ) implement utilizing statistical mixed model theory jackknife estimate . These simulation require assumption regard magnitude variance component associate different random effect . As pilot study obtain estimate variance component conduct , variance component estimate Riverain study SoftView 510 ( k ) ( Record # BSSI-PR-09-00006 ) use similar technology propose ClearRead CT Insight device use power simulation . Please note variance component scale total variance represent proportion total variance explain component . All power estimate dependent upon appropriateness assume variance component .</detailed_description>
