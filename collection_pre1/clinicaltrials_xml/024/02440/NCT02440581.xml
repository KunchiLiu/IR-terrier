	<brief_summary>Renal osteodystrophy ( ROD ) represent bone histologic abnormality result loss renal function . It start early loss kidney function see virtually chronic end stage kidney disease patient dialysis ( CKD-5D ) . A major component ROD bone loss lead chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) associate osteoporosis . Debilitating hip fracture occur patient CKD rate 4.4 time higher general population , associate high cost , morbidity annual mortality 64 % . CKD osteoporosis distinctly different post-menopausal osteoporosis . Presently , uniformly accept CKD osteoporosis treatment protocol exist challenge relate racially specific bone turnover state . Therefore , physician reluctant treat disorder despite profound impact health quality life , association vascular calcification . These vascular calcification confer increase risk cardiovascular event major cause 20 % annual mortality rate CKD-5D patient . The goal propose control randomize study test concept CKD osteoporosis successfully treat treatment individualized patient ' turnover status . The study demonstrate reversal bone loss achieve increase bone formation low turnover patient , reduce bone resorption normal high turnover patient . A second aim study provide new information whether treatment also retard progression vascular calcification . Blood test measure FGF23 , indicator Wnt pathway activity , bone resorption formation follow understand potential mechanism evaluate usefulness prediction change bone mass vascular calcification . CKD-5D patient establish osteoporosis enrol one two treatment arm base bone turnover status . Each arm adaptively randomize race , age gender treatment control group . In low turnover arm , teriparatide combine cinacalcet give , normal high turnover arm , alendronate administer . Bone mineral density measure baseline one year treatment quantitative compute tomography . Calcifications coronary , aorta heart valve also measure time multi-detector computed tomography . If proof-of-concept study successful , offer heretofore unavailable treatment osteoporosis CKD-5D patient thus change prevail clinical practice paradigm . This provide immediate benefit CKD patient reduce fracture risk , bone pain , cardiovascular risk , greatly improve quality life . These improvement also convey major socioeconomic benefit decrease high associate treatment cost . The propose study highly relevant National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ' mission disseminate science-based information improve health quality life patient endocrine , metabolic kidney disease .</brief_summary>

( The current routine clinical practice dialysis clinic check calcidiol status twice yearly supplement vitamin D accord serum calcidiol level . It therefore unlikely substantial number patient exclude due exclusion criterion . )</criteria>
