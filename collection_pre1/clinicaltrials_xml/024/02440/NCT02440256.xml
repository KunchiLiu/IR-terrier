	<detailed_description>The public health response HIV/AIDS epidemic turn focus mean optimize health care delivery , re-engineering delivery system maximize case identification , well access sustain engagement antiretroviral treatment . Opioid Substitution Treatment ( OST ) provide critical opportunity HIV test linkage antiretroviral treatment . The EHOST study cluster-randomized , stepped-wedge trial evaluate prescriber-focused intervention increase HIV test rate , optimize antiretroviral treatment re-engagement retention outcome among individual engage OST . The study encompass drug treatment clinic currently admit patient treatment opioid dependence across province British Columbia , think treat 90 % OST caseload . The trial execute 24-month period , group clinic receive intervention 6-month interval . Evaluation effectiveness propose intervention conduct entirely exist data collection mechanism , focus three primary outcome : ( ) HIV test rate among know HIV positive ; ( ii ) rate Highly Active Antiretroviral ( HAART ) initiation among HAART ; ( iii ) rate HAART continuation among HAART . Despite randomized delivery intervention , difference-in-differences analytical framework apply adjust potential residual heterogeneity patient case mix , volume , quality care across OST clinic . Facilitated establish collaboration key stakeholder across province , hypothesize EHOST intervention optimize HIV test care within marginalize hard-to-reach population .</detailed_description>
