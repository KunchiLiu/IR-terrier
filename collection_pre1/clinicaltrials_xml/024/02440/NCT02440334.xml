	<brief_summary>The purpose propose trial determine whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) use assess recurrence renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) cryoablation compare contrast enhance CT MR ( standard evaluation ) . This study involve off-label use FDA-approved ultrasound contrast agent , Optison flow vascularity . CEUS perform two three dimensional ultrasound examine post-cryoablation vascularity change screen recurrent disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two Three Dimensional Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Screening Renal Cell Carcinoma Recurrence Following Cryoablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects eligible trial enrollment identify Thomas Jefferson University Urology group patient population subject active surveillance recurrence previously cryoablated RCC . A research coordinator explain study patient . The patient give time consider risk benefit study ask question participation . The coordinator review consent form patient patient give form review . The patient , coordinator , study investigator sign consent form . The patient give copy sign consent form record . Screening assessment perform prior CEUS image . Trial participant presence inclusion criterion absence exclusion criterion verify provide medical history . A full demographic profile , know drug allergy intolerance , review subject 's medical/surgical history record . If subject woman childbearing age , urine pregnancy test ( result make available subject prior study initiation ) . All contrast injection supervise board certify physician . Resuscitation equipment train personnel immediate proximity patient CEUS exam . The ultrasound examination perform qualified sonographer . Ultrasound exam take place morning prior patient 's 8 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 month CT/MRI follow ( schedule part clinical care ) consultation Jefferson 's Urology clinic ( patient image perform outside Jefferson ) . Procedures equipment trial use accordance typical clinical procedure . All trial procedure conduct accordance Good Clinical Practice . For ultrasound examination , patient ask lie supine position catheter place superficial vein ( preferably antecubital vein ) . Acoustic couple gel apply area interest . A state art ultrasound scanner 2D 3D curvilinear probe use . A baseline ultrasound grayscale scan use identify tumor evaluate follow criterion : size , shape , orientation lesion ; echogenicity compare surround tissue . Standard power Doppler lesion also perform . When possible , previous MR/CT data upload onto scanner order perform image fusion ultrasound guidance imaging . The distribution color signal overall color content tumor evaluate compare pattern amount color normal surround tissue . Following baseline scanning , patient receive 1 ml intravenous injection Optison ( GE Healthcare , Princeton , NJ ) peripheral vein follow renal mass image 2D CHI ( nonlinear contrast imaging package ) . Ten minute 2D CEUS exam , patient receive second bolus injection Optison follow 3D CHI ( use curvilinear 3D array ) . All contrast injection supervise board certify physician . Resuscitation equipment train personnel immediate proximity patient contrast-enhanced ultrasound exam . Digital clip exams record contrast agent wash-in wash-out phase least two minute store later use . The subject monitor adverse reaction 30 minute . If patient wish continue participate study , eligible CEUS exams future clinically schedule follow exam long take place within study timeframe . Patients monitor AEs 30 minute contrast administration . All procedure perform accord standard care . No patient monitoring require side effect Optison acute nature renal toxicity report .</detailed_description>
