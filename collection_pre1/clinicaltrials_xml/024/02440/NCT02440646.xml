	<detailed_description>The retrospective study show atherosclerotic plaque responsible future acute coronary syndrome angiographically mild , lesion-related risk factor major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) poorly understood . Pathological study show thrombotic coronary occlusion rupture lipid-rich atheroma thin fibrous layer intimal tissue cover necrotic core ( thin-cap fibroatheroma ) common cause myocardial infarction death cardiac cause . However , prospective identification thin-cap fibroatheromas achieve , part imaging tool identify vivo exist recently ( Stone GW , et al , 2011 ; doi : 10.1056/NEJMoa1002358 ) . Both CTA 3D QCA provide u potential non-invasive imaging atherosclerotic lesion , accuracy safety remain keystone limitation approach . CTA unique advantage detect non-calcifying plaque addition calcify lesion , thus allow direct visualisation early atherosclerosis stage lipid fibrous atheroma , risk factor future coronary event . Long-term study report increase risk adverse outcome associate vulnerable fibroatheroma , whereas calcify lesion tend remain rather stable . Studies investigate accuracy , outcome , thus , diagnostic benefit coronary CTA chest pain patient scarce ( Plank F , et al , 2014 ; doi:10.1136/openhrt-2014-000096 ) . The accuracy three dimensional ( 3D ) QCA recently develop overcome 2D QCA limitation , however , accuracy precision 3D QCA measurement different stage lesion establish ( Kan J , et al , 2014 ) . In prospective cohort single-center observational study REALITY , 720-1080 chest pain patient ( 'all-comers ' REALITY registry CTA patient , Ural Institute Cardiology , Yekaterinburg , Russia ; www.cardio-burg.ru ) without acute coronary syndrome enrol admitted chest pain outpatient center ( The Heart Clinics , Yekaterinburg , Russia ; www.hclinic.ru ) September 2010 May 2015 underwent functional testing compute tomography angiography , and/ 3D quantitative coronary angiography without percutaneous coronary intervention . Subsequent plaque burden/ % stenosis ( plaque burden culprit non-culprit lesion calculate lesion volume ( vessel volume-lumen volume ) /lumen volume x 100 ; variable adjust CTA 3D QCA due technical limitation ; correlation PB variable ( include composition atheroma ) assess ) , major adverse cardiovascular event ( death cardiac cause , cardiac arrest , myocardial infarction , rehospitalization due unstable progressive angina ) judge relate either originally treat ( culprit ) lesion untreated ( non-culprit ) lesion . Moreover , clinical potential CTA vs 3D QCA two real-world patient flow Chest Pain center estimate special focus safety ( contrast-induced nephropathy , radiocontrast-induced thyroid dysfunction , radiation dose ) . The diagnostic accuracy CTA 3D QCA analyze deceased patient . The follow-up period achieve 3-5 year retro- prospectively collected clinical event image outcome determine hospital , 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 month first image examination . The independent ethic expertise provide Ural Medical University , Yekaterinburg , Russia ( www.usma.ru ) . The monitoring clinical data image well CoreLab expertise ( software Medis Medical Imaging Systems B.V. : QAngio XA , QAngio XA 3D RE , QAngio CT RE ) provide De Haar Research Foundation , Rotterdam , Netherlands . Patients provide Coronary Passport ( REALITY Registry ) include data complex examination 128-slice CT , two interview risk factor modification recommendation , lab screening ( serum fasting glucose , asparagine transaminase , alanine transaminase , total bilirubin , carbamide/ urea , creatinine , total cholesterol , triglyceride , LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , VLDL cholesterol ) , complete blood count , ECG , Echo . The Registry patient test HeartAge , SCORE , Duke ACC/ AHA , Duke - DCS , Diamond-Forrester - DFM , The Seattle Angina Questionnaire - SAQ , Duke Activity Status Index -DASI , EQ-5D-5L . Patients screen major risk factor modification : unhealthy blood cholesterol level , high blood pressure , smoking , insulin resistance , diabetes , overweight obesity , lack physical activity , unhealthy diet ( element Mediterranean call 'Russian ' diet ) , old age , genetic lifestyle factor , family history early heart disease . Moreover factor CRP , sleep apnea , stress alcohol consumption assess .
