	<detailed_description>Rationale project : Cognitive difficulty may occur chronic pain , potentially indicative compromise functioning frontal brain region , also result great difficulty control pain , increase rumination worry . Discovering successful method strengthen neural system may improve cognitive skill important daily life maximise therapeutic outcome . Research question : In people experience cognitive deficit due pain condition : 1 . Can neurocognitive ability improve ? 2 . Can improvement bring good daily function general ? 3 . If training protocol improve cognition , also effect pain reduction , i.e. , extent pain interfere person 's life ? Aim : The overarch aim research determine whether cognitive function improve via training protocol people experience cognitive difficulty relate chronic pain . Design : This randomise controlled trial examine effect cognitive training compare active control . The investigator aim enrol 40 participant chronic pain study : 20 training , 20 active control . This sample size chosen base power analysis moderate effect size , consistent sample size exist cognitive training literature , though similar study far do chronic pain population . Both group complete respective study activity 3 time per week , 45 minute time , across 8 week . They assess complete 8-week period , within day completion . Procedures : 40 participant recruit via Caulfield Pain Management Research Centre . After decide participate meeting inclusion criterion , participant invite attend first on-site assessment session Monash University , Clayton . The first assessment session include overview train program demonstration task , overview active control activity ( applicable ) . Both assessment session involve detailed assessment cognition , pain , mood . The cognitive training protocol run use pre-validated software delivers brain training `` game '' . The game design visually interesting engaging , varied session comprise multiple different game , avoid boredom . They begin easy-to-follow instruction demonstration , participant progress , difficulty automatically increase correspondence performance , avoid ceiling plateau effect . Participants assign program target multiple facet cognition find compromise chronic pain state , include divide attention , work memory , mentally plan sequence item form pattern complete puzzle , response inhibition . This software accessible via internet desktop laptop computer , tablet device . All training session complete home . The researcher hold master account , allow log monitor participant progress compliance training . The active control group provide variety video watch , content style documentaries general interest topic nature , travel , culture , history . These also visually stimulate engage , involve increment difficulty . They may provide distraction pain may relax . Throughout protocol , researcher weekly contact participant phone video call . Keeping regular contact way maintain engagement research team , help boost motivation allow participant express issue may protocol .</detailed_description>
