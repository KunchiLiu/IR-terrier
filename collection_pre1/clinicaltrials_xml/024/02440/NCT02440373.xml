	<brief_summary>Cytochrome c mitochondrial protein play key role energy metabolism . When mitochondrion injure , cytochrome c may leave mitochondrion reach bloodstream . The investigator plan investigate whether circulate cytochrome c level may serve biomarker traumatic injury correlating ( 1 ) severity traumatic injury , ( 2 ) development organ dysfunction , ( 3 ) clinical outcome . The Trauma Services ALGH enroll 8 month 100 consecutive trauma patient require intubation mechanical ventilation survive hospital admission . The Resuscitation Institute RFUMS measure cytochrome c level plasma take upon hospital admission subsequently 24 , 48 , 72 hour , additional plasma store marker define late time . Blood cytochrome c level analyze relation severity traumatic injury , development organ dysfunction , clinical outcome include survival functional status ( adjust covariates age , gender , type trauma , time stabilization , comorbidities , etc . ) use information obtain part routine medical care . Successful completion project support blood cytochrome c biomarker traumatic injury could use identify severity , predict outcome , ass novel mitochondrial protective strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose determine whether plasma cytochrome c could serve clinical biomarker traumatic injury examine relationship plasma level cytochrome c severity initial injury upon arrival hospital , subsequent development organ dysfunction , clinical outcome . Cytochrome c mitochondrial protein play crucial role energy metabolism enable transfer electron complex III ( i.e. , cytochrome c reductase ) complex IV ( cytochrome c oxidase ) . Upon mitochondrial injury contingent severity , cytochrome c may release cytosol subsequently bloodstream . The rationale project stem : ( 1 ) observation Resuscitation Institute animal model cardiac arrest resuscitation plasma cytochrome c correlate directly severity post-resuscitation leave ventricular dysfunction inversely survival ( 2 ) observation others report correlation plasma cytochrome c severity organ injury . The investigator hypothesize plasma cytochrome c measure upon arrival hospital reflect severity initial traumatic injury result aggregate effect direct injury organ , ischemic injury consequent blood loss , delay stabilization , preexistent comorbidity - factor injure mitochondrion . The investigator hypothesize initial cytochrome c plasma level combine level measure subsequent three day hospitalization correlate development organ dysfunction , clinical outcome . The current proposal structure three specific aim : Specific Aim 1 ( collection blood sample clinical data ) : For aim investigator plan enroll 100 consecutive trauma victim admit Advocate Lutheran General Hospital ( ALGH ) period 8 month present single multisystem injury meet specific entry exclusion criterion develop ensure broad range injury severity . Blood sample within 15 minute hospital arrival ( e.g. , Emergency Department Operating Room ) subsequently 24 , 48 , 72 hour . Plasma separate stored −80 °C subsequent batch measurement cytochrome c ( marker mitochondrial injury may become available time analysis ) Resuscitation Institute Rosalind Franklin Univer-sity Medicine Science ( RFUMS ) . Clinical data extract tool use clinically - include Illinois Trauma Registry Worksheet medical record - use : ( ) record severity initial traumatic injury calculate Trauma Score - Injury Severity Score ( TRISS ) along detailed assessment individual organ injury ; ( ii ) estimate severity blood loss base base deficit transfusion need ; ( iii ) determine subsequent development organ dysfunction calculate Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score ( MODS ) Sequential Organ Failure Score ; ( iv ) ass outcomes measure length stay Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) , length stay hospital , survival upon hospital discharge , functional status upon hospital discharge . Specific Aim 2 ( analysis plasma cytochrome c ) : Frozen sample arterial plasma , store −80°C ALGH , transfer Resuscitation Institute RFU cytochrome c measure use electrochemiluminescence . Specific Aim 3 ( statistical analysis model ) : A database devoid patient identifier create merge clinical information value plasma cytochrome c level marker become available . Considering pilot nature project , statistical modeling analysis primarily exploratory focus identify relationship plasma cytochrome c level upon hospital arrival clinical element contribute severity primary traumatic injury . The analysis modeling also include examine predictive value initial subsequent plasma cytochrome c level development organ dysfunction clinical outcome . The long-term goal project develop plasma cytochrome c biomarker traumatic injury clinical condition associate mitochondrial injury could use bedside - i.e. , develop point care assay - ( 1 ) assess severity illness , ( 2 ) prognostication outcome , ( 3 ) clinical re-search novel therapeutic intervention aim reduce mitochondrial injury .</detailed_description>
