	<brief_summary>Severe Alcoholic hepatitis , define modify Maddrey 's Discriminant Function ( DF ) ≥32 , associate significant morbidity mortality . ( 1,2 ) Of various treatment modality evaluate treatment Severe Alcoholic hepatitis ( SAH ) , Corticosteroids extensively study . ( 1 ) Five 13 Randomized control trial , four 5 meta-analysis show survival benefit Corticosteroids , especially patient DF ≥32 and/ Hepatic Encephalopathy . ( 1-4 ) However , role Corticosteroids Severe Alcoholic hepatitis still remain somewhat controversial . ( 5-6 ) Corticosteroids therapy consider ideal option author beneficial effect seem confine highly select minority group inhibitory effect corticosteroid liver inflammation outweigh side effect weaken defense infection , anti-anabolic effect , possible ulcer promote effect . ( 6 ) Corticosteroids supposedly contraindicate DF &gt; 54 MELD &gt; 24 . ( 7 ) This need confirm . Also Corticosteroids contraindicate patient renal failure , gastro-intestinal bleed , pancreatitis active sepsis . Therefore , constant effort evaluate new therapy SAH . In recent trial , combination glucocorticoid plus N-acetylcysteine find improve one month survival patient Severe Alcoholic hepatitis , compare glucocorticoid alone . However six month survival different group . ( 8 ) Bovine Colostrum rich protein , immunoglobulin , lactoferrin growth factor . Recent study suggest Colostrum component , immunoglobulin growth factor benefit physically active person treatment autoimmune disorder . It use treatment wide variety gastrointestinal condition , include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gut injury , H pylorus infection , immune deficiency relate diarrhea well infective diarrhea . ( 9 ) The guideline American College Gastroenterology ( 10 ) author ( 11 ) suggest combination Corticosteroids drug , different mechanism action , may beneficial reduce mortality severe alcoholic hepatitis . Hence , investigator plan compare efficacy combine therapy Corticosteroids Bovine colostrum versus Corticosteroids alone treatment severe alcoholic hepatitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Combination Therapy Corticosteroids Bovine Colostrum Versus Corticosteroids Placebo : Randomized Double Blind Placebo Controlled Trial Treatment Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diagnosis : The diagnosis Alcoholic hepatitis make follow criterion ( 12 ) I . Chronic active alcohol abuse - &gt; 80 grams/ day male &gt; 20 grams/day female . Alcohol use evaluate AUDIT score [ EASL guideline ( 13 ) ] II . Duration jaundice &lt; 3 month III . Serum Bilirubin &gt; 5 mg/dl IV . AST/ALT &gt; 2:1 V. AST &lt; 300 IU/L VI . Prolonged PTI/INR VII . Neutrophilic leucocytosis VIII . Liver biopsy ( In many case possible ) . Assessment Severity Maddrey 's Discriminant Function ( 14 ) Discriminant Function Index ( DFI ) originally describe Maddrey colleague placebo control study ass benefit Corticosteroids patient AH . The original formula 4.6 x prothrombin time ( second ) + serum Bilirubin ( mg/dl ) . Subsequently score modified 1986 call Modified Discriminant Function ( DF ) . DF = 4.6 x ( Patient 's PT - Control PT ) + serum bilirubin ( mg/dl ) . Untreated patient DF &gt; 32 survival 68 % . The American College Gastroenterology ( 9 ) recommend patient MDF &gt; 32 / Encephalopathy treat Corticosteriods . MELD score ( 15 ) The model end stage liver disease ( MELD ) score predicts survival patient cirrhosis use prioritize patient liver transplantation . MELD score = ( 0.957 x log serum creatinine + 0.378 x log serum bilirubin + 1.120 x log INR + 0.643 ) x 10 . The advantage MELD score use INR place PT . The INR comparable uniform across laboratory worldwide . The American Association Study Liver Diseases recommend MELD score &gt; 20 predicts SAH criterion initiate treatment . Serial monitoring MELD score change 2 point first week treatment independently predict mortality . GAHS score ( 16 ) Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score ( GAHS ) include age , peripheral Total Leucocyte Count , serum Bilirubin ( day 1 6-9 ) , blood urea nitrogen PT . It good predictor mortality 28 day MDF . GAHS score &gt; 9 extremely poor prognosis unless treated Corticosteroids . The drawback lack international validation . LILLE 'S model ( 17 ) It use predict mortality SAH . ( If score 0.45 CS stop ) The diagnosis SAH make follow criterion 1 . MDF &gt; 32 , 2 . MELD &gt; 20 Treatment Abstinence alcohol This important factor predict outcome survive acute alcoholic hepatitis ( AH ) episode . The incidence recidivism recovery first episode AH varies 10 - 70 % . Abstinence reinforce give patient oral/enteral Baclofen ( GABA B receptor agonist ) Nutrition Enteral nutrition prefer mode supplemental nutrition . This turn decrease risk bacterial endotoxin translocation result less infection endotoxemia . Pooled data 5 RCT 's AH demonstrate improved nutritional status compare standard dietary intake , without improve survival rate . ( 17 ) The patient give 40kcal/kg diet along 1.5gm/kg protiens , emphasize breakfast night time snack regular oral diet . Frequent interval feed give improved nitrogen balance . Bcomplex multivitamins supplementation provide patient ( EASL guideline 13 ) Pharmacotherapy Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis Corticosteroids Corticosteroids extensively use treatment Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis . 6/13 Randomized Controlled Trials 4/6 meta-analysis support use Corticosteroids Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis . Oral Prednisolone 40mg daily parenteral methylprednisolone ( patient unable take orally ) 32 mg intravenously daily 4 week standard therapy . A Lille score &gt; 0.45 7 day treatment Corticosteroids indication non-response , increased susceptibility infection diminish survival . ( 18,19 ) The Corticosteroids stop Lilli score &gt; 0.45 . Pentoxifylline Pentoxifylline phosphodiesterase inhibitor . It give orally dose 400mg thrice day 28 day . In pivotal study 101 patient SAH ( 20 ) , associate survival benefit 50 % . In another study , find superior Corticosteroids . ( 21 ) In recent study involve 50 patient center ( 21 ) , investigator find 20 % vs 40 % mortality patient treat Pentoxifylline versus control , 4 week treatment . Acute kidney injury cause death 20 % compare 70 % patient Pentoxifylline group versus control . Pentoxifylline induce recovery renal &amp; hepatic function trend towards increase survival . However , metanalysis 5 Randomized Controlled Trials fail show benefit Pentoxifylline . ( 22 ) In large recent trial , Corticosteriods plus Pentoxifylline 4 week treatment compare prednisolone alone , result improve 6-month survival . ( 23 ) N-Acetylcyteine N-acetylcysteine could value antioxidant treatment acute alcoholic hepatitis , thiol group N-acetylcysteine able reduce level free radical . Administration N-acetylcysteine might reconstitute glutathione stock hepatocytes . At present , N-acetylcysteine use treatment acetaminophen induce hepatitis . Intravenous acetylcysteine often used antidote acetaminophen overdose due ability increase level glutathione ; however , also use treat non-acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure ( NAI-ALF ) severe alcoholic hepatitis prevent contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) . Although i.v . oral formulation acetylcysteine evaluate indication , study examine i.v . form . Intravenous Acetylcysteine use treatment NAI-ALF improve oxygenation liver . A trial evaluate efficacy glucocorticoid plus N-acetylcysteine , compare glucocorticoid alone , patient SAH ( 24 ) report improved one month survival combine treatment group . Bovine colostrum Bovine colostrum ( BC ) first milk produce birth particularly rich immunoglobulin , antimicrobial peptide ( lactoferrin lacto peroxidase ) bioactive molecule , include growth factor important nutrition , growth development newborn infant also passive immunity . BC produce cow first one day post parturition . This `` early '' milk nutrient profile immunological composition substantially different 'mature ' milk . It contain macronutrient like protein , carbohydrate , oligosaccharide , fat micronutrient like vitamin mineral , also growth factor , anti-microbial compound immune regulate constituent either present mature milk present substantially low concentration . ( 25,26 ) Bovine colostrum use treatment HIV-positive patient chronic diarrhea , ( 27 ) rotavirus diarrhea child . ( 28 ) Available evidence suggest beneficial effect supplementation bovine colostrum improve body composition , aspects athletic performance , diarrhea person immune-deficiency syndrome , NSAID-induced gastrointestinal ulcer , acute phase response occur secondary surgery . Specific hyperimmune BC , produce high neutralizing titer activity Cryptosporidia , H. pylorus , measles , rotavirus , Shigella sp. , appear clinical utility condition associate infectious organism . ( 29 ) Historically colostrum use various illness India well abroad thousand year . Ayurvedic physician India use bovine colostrum medicinal spiritual purpose since cow first domesticate . By late 18th century , Western medicine start take interest colostrum study potential health benefit . As consequence , prescribe many condition , include immune system enhancement . Interestingly , development penicillin artificial antibiotic 20th century , colostrum commonly use fight bacterial infection . In early 20th century note antibody level first milk produce birth much high level find milk produce 72 hour later . There 2000 publish scientific article document safety efficacy use colostrum . This seemingly perfect food show non-species specific . ( 30 ) In 2005 , report safe effective repair tissue well enhance immunity . ( 31 ) The use BC dietary supplement increase substantially past decade . BC harvest within first hour calve dairy animal . The herd cow keep close supervision good state hygiene without exposure antibody , pesticide anthelmintic . The colostrum collect within 24 hour contain maximum substance less amount , colostrum collect later quantity contain less immunoglobins . ( 31 ) Colostrum contain growth factor help build lean muscle , include insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-I &amp; IGF-II ) growth hormone ( GH ) . IGF-I , find naturally colostrum , natural hormone capable promote muscle growth . The IGFs human cow identical , BC actually contain great concentration IGF-I human colostrum . This fact make BC attractive bodybuilder , athletes others seek gain muscle mass . According study conduct Finland , IGF-1 induces protein synthesis , lead increase lean muscle mass without correspond rise adipose ( fat ) tissue . The growth factor colostrum `` shift fuel utilization carbohydrate fat . It mean body burn fat , include fat make carbohydrate protein consume , produce fuel efficiently . ( 32 ) Bovine hormone factor like gastrin play role trophic factor mucosal growth stomach . GLP-2 show general trophic response gut . Peptide growth factor colostrum influence maintenance mucosal mass integrity . EGF stimulate cell proinfection also influence crypt fission . ( 25 ) While BC consider rich source Ig , growth factor , lactoferrin , currently specific standard exist define BC dietary supplement respect actual constituent amount constituent . The following constituent generally present bovine colostrum : macronutrients ; vitamin ; mineral ; Ig ( IgG , IgM , IgA - include secretory form ) ; cytokine include interleukin-1beta ( IL-1β ) , interleukin- 6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) , interferon-gamma ( INF-γ ) ; growth factor include insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) I II , transform growth factor-beta ( TGF-β ) , epidermal growth factor ; lactoperoxidase ; lactoferrin . Depending health cow , feed practice follow , collection period , processing/concentration practice utilize specific manufacturer , actual range quantity specific macro- micronutrient , Ig , cytokine , growth factor , compound might vary considerably . ( 35,36,37 ) BC contain relatively high amount Ig . Typically , Ig general , IgG specifically , constitute large contribution protein content BC , lactalbumin casein contribute less amount . Mean percentages fat , protein , lactose colostrum 6.7 , 14.9 , 2.5 , respectively . ( 38 ) Other report estimate Ig concentration bovine mammary secretion range IgG1 ( 52-87 g/L ) , IgG2 ( 1.6-2.1 g/L ) , IgM ( 3.7-6.1 g/L ) , IgA ( 3.2-6.2 g/L ) . ( 39,40 ) As rule , Ig contribution decline substantially BC collect 24 hour post-parturition amount lactalbumin casein increase proportionately .
