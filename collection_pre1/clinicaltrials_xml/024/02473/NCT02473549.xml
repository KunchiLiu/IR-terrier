	<brief_summary>Many individual often leave problem move arm hand , month even year stroke . Recent progress research suggest application non-invasive brain stimulation , transcranial direct current stimulation ( TDCS ) , conjunction rehabilitation exercise improve person 's ability move stroke . However , problem n't work everyone , researcher know . One reason may TDCS currently apply use one-size-fits-all approach . Researchers apply type TDCS everyone , assume stroke affect everyone way . But , researcher know case . For example , person likely different amount damage brain region control movement . A good understanding stroke uniquely affect person 's brain help u know correct type TDCS apply person . Therefore , objective research determine whether amount damage brain region control movement predict type TDCS effective help person improve ability move . Participants undergo 1 session magnetic resonance imaging , three session TDCS .</brief_summary>
