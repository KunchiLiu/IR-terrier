	<brief_summary>The goal antiretroviral therapy maintain undetectable plasma viral load , present condition prevent progression disease , improve immune restoration prevent emergence viral resistance mutation . In addition individual benefit , antiretroviral treatment reduces transmission HIV infect person sexual partner . There date alternative strategy antiretroviral treatment antiretroviral therapy , even extend , allow viral eradication . The need maintain antiretroviral therapy life raise long-term safety concern , even late molecule . Also , one key issue clinical research whether reach undetectable viral load , antiretroviral treatment reduce order reduce exposure molecule . Indeed , treatment `` maintenance '' could potentially need small antiviral potency . On hand , reduction antiretroviral treatment reduces cost , important consideration light new global recommendation treatment patient T-cells CD4 500 / mm3 . The alleviation antiretroviral therapy either reduce number molecule make monotherapies dual therapy , realize intermittent treatment reduce dos molecule randomize ENCORE -1 show equivalence dose Efavirenz 400mg instead 600mg naive patient . Atalow study sense lower dose Atazanavir / Ritonavir combination two NRTI reduce exposure molecule cost maintain undetectable viral load .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Efficacy Reduced Dose Atazanavir HIV-1-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protease inhibitor ( PIs ) key treatment current therapeutic strategy . They major quality antiviral potency high genetic barrier . However , long-term use associate gastrointestinal side effect , metabolic disorder ( lipid , carbohydrate , lipohypertrophy ) cardiovascular comorbidities , renal bone . The decrease IP dos would reduce predominantly concentration-dependent toxicity . Atazanavir ( Reyataz ) first protease inhibitor daily approved 2003 treatment HIV patient . Its favorable safety profile , ease making effectiveness make treatment widely use recommend first line . Atazanavir recommend Europe naïve patient 300 mg dose daily boost ritonavir 100 mg pretreated patient 300 mg boost 100mg ritonavir dose 400 boost mg combination two antiretroviral drug . After oral administration , atazanavir rapidly absorb improved variable bioavailability food intake ( 40 % increase Cmin ) dependent gastric potential hydrogen ( pH ) . Atazanavir highly bind plasma protein ( 86 % ) largely metabolise isoform 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) cytochrome P450 . There great variability pharmacokinetics atazanavir patient due inter-individual variability expression function CYP3A4 . Co-administration ritonavir increase 11.9 time Cmin decrease interindividual variability . The major effect ritonavir decrease hepatic clearance atazanavir . Its half-life elimination 8.6 hour administer 300 mg 100 mg ritonavir . 90 % inhibitory concentration atazanavir adjust plasma protein binding ( PBA EC90 ) 14ng / ml . At standard dose 300 mg take 100 mg ritonavir daily , mean trough concentration steady state accord research 526 ng / ml 862 ng / ml HIV patient . Residual therapeutic level ( Cmin ) must great 150 ng / ml . The relationship residual plasma concentration virologic response demonstrate naive patient pharmacokinetic substudy BMS 089 . If inhibitor atazanavir best tolerate lipid map protease responsible specific side effect hyperbilirubinemia nephrolithiasis , concentration-dependent side effect . Indeed , atazanavir responsible reversible elevation unconjugated bilirubin , inhibit glucuronide conjugation bilirubin UGT1A1 . This effect , easily conceal patient , important annoy side effect may interfere treatment adherence . This hyperbilirubinemia concentration-dependent , elevate bilirubin common grade 3-4 , atazanavir C min great 760 ng / ml ( 600 850 ng / ml accord study ) . No boosted atazanavir may use caution . Indeed , use avoid patient history failure virological resistance mutation patient poor adherence patient take drug could interfere atazanavir . Pharmacokinetic study dose 400 mg without ritonavir show concentration expect minimum concentration 150 mg / l 60 % case . In addition , use boost atazanavir tenofovir little studied require close monitoring pharmacological give interaction two molecule ( decrease approximately 25 % concentration atazanavir without ritonavir combination tenofovir . Finally , INDUMA study , virologic rebound strategy . Monotherapy atazanavir recommend light study show virological failure strategy . The evaluation atazanavir / r 200/100 healthy patient present CROI meeting 2001 Phase II study show mean Cmin 378 ng / ml ( SD = 286 EC ) . A retrospective cohort study 14 Thai patient virologic success switch atazanavir / r 200/100 show maintenance CV le 50 copy / ml median follow-up 68 week ( range 12-165 week ) . Five patient dose atazanavir Cmin great 150 ng / ml ( mean Cmin = 572 ng / ml ) . The lipid profile improve significantly . A pharmacokinetic study 22 Thai patient atazanavir / r 300/100 switch atazanavir / r 200/100 2 NRTIs show minimum concentration reduce 48.6 % remain minimum therapeutic concentration 150 ng / ml ( mean Cmin = 700 ng / ml EC = 470 ) . A case study conduct 14 Italian patient ( 10 Caucasian 4 African origin ) virologic suppression ( CV 50 copy / ml ) atazanavir / r 300/100 mg + 2 NRTI show maintenance viral efficacy switch atazanavir / r 200/100 1 year average follow-up . Atazanavir C min Cmin except 2 patient ( whose viral load remain 50 copy / ml ) , mean Cmin 713ng / ml . Bilirubin decrease switch . Recently , pharmacokinetic simulation study perform majority Caucasian patient atazanavir / r dose 300/50 mg , 200/50 mg 200/100 mg . The low concentration atazanavir dose reduction 200/100 average 520 ng / ml ( EC = 448 ) remain recommended Cmin . In total , four dose reduction study atazanavir / r 200/100 treatment-experienced patient virologic average Cmin 520 713ng / ml , well therapeutic Cmin . The decrease atazanavir dose show significant decrease serum bilirubin 14.88μmol / l 2 week . This test within overall reflection optimization antiretroviral therapy . In view exist data Pharmacology data Italian Thai switch patient atazanavir / r 200/100 mg , ATALOW study hypothesize low dose atazanavir / r 200 / 100 mg able maintain undetectable viral load treatment-experienced patient virologic success . The expected benefit reduction dose atazanavir / r 200/100 mg + would : - A good tolerance especially term bilirubin - A robust strategy use boost atazanavir possibility use tenofovir combination NRTI . - The simplicity take day - Reduced cost ( 2,730 euros less per patient per year ) .</detailed_description>
