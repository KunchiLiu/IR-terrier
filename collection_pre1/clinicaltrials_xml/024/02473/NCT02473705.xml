	<brief_title>Pathways Improving Functional Capacity Older Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) high morbidity mortality cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Both condition common old patient . Reduced exercise capacity predict poor outcomes patient CVD2 CKD . Although exercise tolerance impair CKD4 limit improvement patient possible . A critical gap knowledge optimize exercise capacity patient improve quality possibly length life . In CKD , structure function skeletal muscle derange . In addition , energy production mitochondrion fall age , various disease also reduce CKD . Recent study group report difference mitochondrial function associate variance physical ability , exercise capacity , gait speed . In preliminary data , patient enter Cardiac Rehabilitation ( CR ) Stage III CKD [ glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 ] decrease improvement exercise capacity compare normal GFR ( Δ1.7 vs 2.7 Metabolic Equivalents Exercise METs , p &lt; 0.05 ) despite degree adherence . Exercise capacity CR patient reduce GFR great n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n-3 PUFA ) users non-users [ Δ MET 2.0 ( 1.4-2.5 ) v 1.4 ( 1.1-1.7 ) , p &lt; 0.05 ] , suggest n-3 PUFA exercise may better exercise alone . With beneficial clinical effect CKD , n-3 PUFA extensively investigate dialysis population . In patient population , include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease dilate cardiomyopathy daily ingestion/use n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n-3 PUFA ) fish oil improves exercise capacity . This intervention safe , simple well-tolerated . Multiple line evidence suggest muscle mitochondrial function improve exercise n-3 PUFA supplementation.Such treatment may improve mitochondrial bioenergetics various mechanism include up-regulation mitochondrial biogenesis gene involve mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation , well increase mitochondrial content , function . Flow mediate vasodilation impaired CKD . It may improve n-3 PUFA supplementation could alternative mechanism improve oxygen delivery muscle old patient CAD CKD non-CKD population . A possible benefit n-3 PUFA suppression inflammation . Current practice , however , enter patient CAD CKD standard CR without prescription n-3 PUFA . Experimental epidemiological study indicate acidemia metabolic acidosis associate development progression CKD increase mortality patient . Metabolic acidosis associate CKD also contribute skeletal muscle atrophy activation ubiquitin-proteasome axis . Even slight correction acidosis improve anabolic state muscle downregulation ubiquitin-proteasome system . Clinically , bicarbonate supplementation may improve muscle function . This intervention also safe , simple well-tolerated . Given muscular function abnormal CKD n-3 PUFA bicarbonate supplementation show improve muscular function exercise capacity , purpose investigation study effect substance exercise capacity patient CAD CKD . The investigator propose double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , 2x2 factorial design , pilot study n-3 PUFA and/or oral bicarbonate use older ( age &gt; 60 year ) CAD patient concomitant CKD enrol standard , 3-month CR program . The investigator assess effect intervention exercise capacity , marker inflammation serum bicarbonate concentration . The investigator 's goal obtain 8 evaluable patient per group . Exercise capacity measure Oxygen ( VO2 ) peak . Response bicarbonate monitor serum bicarbonate concentration . Since CKD may adversely affect muscle function acidosis and/or mitochondrial function , investigator 's propose may mechanisms poor exercise capacity patient . The investigator 's overarch hypothesis exercise capacity response CR old patient CKD may modifiable concomitant n-3 PUFA and/or bicarbonate use suppress acidosis .</detailed_description>
