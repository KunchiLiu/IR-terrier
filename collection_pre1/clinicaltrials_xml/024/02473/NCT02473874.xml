	<brief_summary>The purpose study obtain skin spectroscopic data two image system . Comparison group : - Skin Spect dermoscope - Spatially modulate quantitative spectrometer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Imaging System Between Spatially Modulated Quantitative Spectroscopy Skin Spect Dermoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher compare spectroscopic data two system well relative concentration melanin , oxy- deoxy- hemoglobin calculate measurement . Skin Spect measure large area skin , whereas Spatially modulate quantitative spectrometer point-based measurement.Therefore , large nevi require multiple Spatially modulate quantitative spectrometer measurement comparison correspond sub-regions large Skin Spect measurement . Only sub-regions image data Skin Spect match location Spatially modulate quantitative spectrometer acquire data use correlation study . This researcher ensure spectral data collect two instrument collect spatial location , lesion heterogeneity present .</detailed_description>
