	<brief_summary>Neuraxial analgesia ( commonly continuous epidural combine spinal epidural ) effective modality available pain relief labor . Accidental dural puncture ( ADP ) large bore epidural needle result post-dural puncture headache ( PDPH ) one significant source anesthesia-related morbidity parturients . Epidural blood patch ( EBP ) gold standard treatment PDPH , although almost always effective , result another ADP , well low back pain low extremity pain . For reason , effective measure prevent PDPH ADP occurs would highly valuable . One small study 50 woman randomly allocate receive 2 epidural injection morphine saline , demonstrate beneficial effect epidural morphine decrease incidence PDPH . This study aim determine efficacy 2 dos neuraxial ( either epidural ( EPID ) intrathecal ) preservative-free morphine ( PFM ) prevent headache ADP parturients .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double blind clinical trial . Subjects ASA I II woman ( per American Society Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System ASA ) age 18 year old , know ADP epidural needle placement neuraxial labor analgesia , either intrathecal catheter epidural catheter situ . Patients randomize either receive PFM placebo ( sterile normal saline ( NS SAL ) ) . For patient epidural catheter , group `` EPID PFM '' receive 3 mg ( 6 ml ) PFM , follow 3 ml sterile normal saline administer epidural catheter . The placebo group , `` EPID NS '' , receive 6 ml sterile normal saline via epidural catheter follow another 3 ml NS . For patient intrathecal catheter , group , `` IT PFM '' receive 200 microgram ( mcg ) ( 0.4 ml ) preservative-free morphine , follow flush catheter 2 ml sterile saline . The placebo group receive 0.4 ml 2 ml sterile normal saline intrathecal catheter . Sixteen 24 hour receive first study drug , patient group visit investigator , daily thereafter hospital admission . They evaluate presence headache , analgesia requirement , need EBP severity opioid side effect . As long patient afebrile , experience severe opioid side effect catheter place intact , patient receive identical study drug ( total two dos ) . The epidural/intrathecal catheter remove immediately second administration study drug . After discharge , patient follow daily telephone minimum 5 day receive last dose study drug remain headache free , minimum 3 day resolution PDPH . Statistical Design : This prospective randomize double blind clinical trial . The primary outcome incidence PDPH 48 hour ADP . The primary outcome trial incidence PDPH 48 hour ADP . We consider difference incidence PDPH placebo treatment group 25 % significant , base finding Al Metwalli et al . ( Anaesthesia . 2008 ; 63 ( 8 ) :847-50 ) , meta-analysis Heesen et al . ( Int J Obstet Anesth . 2013 ; 22 ( 1 ) :26-30 ) . Estimates PDPH rate ADP range 50 85 % . Our rate CUMC past several year 66 % ( OB Anesthesia Division QA data ) . For calculation sample size , determine absolute 25 % decrease PDPH would clinically significant ( i.e. , 66 % ~40 % ) . For power 90 % alpha 0.05 , require 83 subject per group ( 2 epidural group compare , 2 spinal group compare ) . We specifically power comparison spinal epidural group , although likely able . We therefore , aim recruit 100 subject per group ( total 400 across center ) assume 10-15 % subject may lose inadvertent withdrawal catheter , subject withdrawal , lose follow discharge . This intended multicenter study involve 5 academic tertiary hospital , &gt; 2,000 vaginal delivery per year . Since rate accidental dural puncture 1 2 % , estimate able recruit 100 subject per year . Categorical data ( presence absence dural puncture headache , need epidural blood patch ) analyze use Chi-square analysis .</detailed_description>
