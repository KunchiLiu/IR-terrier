	<brief_title>Thymosin Alpha 1 Prevention Pancreatic Infection Following Severe Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Background &amp; Rationale : Infected pancreatic necrosis relate septic complication major cause death patient acute pancreatitis1 , therefore prevention pancreatic infection great clinical value treatment AP . Immunosuppression disorder characterize decreased HLA-DR expression unbalance CD3/CD4+/CD8+ T cell PBMC think associate development pancreatic infection2 , 3 . Thymosin alpha 1 show immunomodulatory property effect prevent pancreatic infection well studied4 . Aim This Study : To evaluate effect TA1 use early phase prevent pancreatic infection , immunomodulation clinical outcome patient AP . Sample Size Estimation : The prevalence pancreatic infection report around 25 % AP episodes . To demonstrate 40 % reduction prevalence pancreatic infection 80 % power two-sided alpha level .05 , project estimate sample size 500 participant . Considering possible 2 % withdraw , plan randomize 510 patient total .</detailed_description>
