	<brief_title>A Window Opportunity Study KTN3379 Surgically Resectable Head Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label study patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) schedule surgery . Two cohort SCCHN patient , HPV negative HPV positive , treated KTN3379 evaluate effect ErbB3 phosphorylation biomarkers tumor tissue . The KTN3379 treatment duration within expect window time elapse initial patient evaluation surgeon performance surgery . Paired preoperative postoperative tumor specimen analyse allow evaluation proliferation , ErbB3 relate biomarkers , pErbB3 modulation pharmacodynamic change downstream molecular pathway .</detailed_description>
