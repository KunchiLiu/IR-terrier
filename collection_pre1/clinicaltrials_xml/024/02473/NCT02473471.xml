	<detailed_description>This study randomize , split mouth design control trial 1:1 allocation ratio . One resident ( A.A ) , calibrate main supervisor ( S.M ) , reliable recruiting subject , undertake orthodontic treatment supervision . The eligibility case reevaluate main supervisor ( E.M ) start treatment . Split mouth design utilized MOPs randomly assign patient ' leave right side eliminate possibility uneven occlusal force habitual occlusion predominantly 1 side also eliminate biological variability subject . The allocation sequence conceal researcher ( A.A ) enrol assess participant sequentially number , opaque , seal stapled envelope participant 's name date birth write intervention . Allocation concealment seek prevent selection bias , protect assignment sequence allocation . A Ethical approval grant Jordan University science technology research center , permission give postgraduate dental clinic Jordan University science technology , Irbid , Jordan . We hypothesize 50 % increased rate tooth movement MOP group would produce clinically significant difference . The sample size calculate depend type I error frequency 5 % . According power analysis assume large effect size difference group 50 % acceleration rate tooth movement , power analysis yield total sample size estimate 44 sample conventional alpha-level ( p = 0.05 ) desire power ( 1 - Î² err prob ) 0.90 , yield 22 sample per group ( mean 22 patient represent 22 MOP group 22 Control group ) . Assuming overall attrition rate 15 % , initial recruitment target total 55 sample 18 patient per group . All calculation perform computer application G-Power ( Erdfelder et al. , 1996 )</detailed_description>
