	<brief_summary>Excessive tiredness ( fatigue ) common problem cancer patient affect quality life negatively . There limited knowledge physical mechanism cause fatigue , medical treatment . Physical activity reduce inconvenience , investigator need learn type intensity exercise work best well motivate patient exercise . The overall aim , evaluate efficacy cost-effectiveness individually tailor high ( H ) low/medium ( LM ) intensity physical training , without behavioural medicine ( BM ) support strategy , adjuvant oncological treatment ; Cancer Related Fatigue ( CRF ) , Quality Life ( QoL ) , mood disturbance , adherence cancer treatment , adverse effect , disease outcome , return daily life complete treatment return work . The investigator also describe change inflammatory marker cytokine related physical training gene expression follow training investigate whether serve mediator effect physical training CRF QoL . This evaluated newly diagnose breast , colorectal prostate cancer patient adjuvant therapy three different centre Sweden ; Uppsala , Lund/Malmö Linköping . A 2x2 factorial design use , 600 patient randomised H , H+BM , LM LM+BM . Patients train two time per week 6 month . This project give ; new knowledge aspect individual gain improved well-being quality life , facilitate return work , possibly reduce risk cancer recurrence . This turn would result low burden health care system , reduced societal cost positive impact public health . Implementation result clinical practice facilitate close collaboration researcher clinician , fact study perform clinical setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose Aims The main aim determine effect high low intensity physical training without integrated behavioral medicine support strategy prevent minimize cancer relate fatigue ( CRF ) , improve health relate quality life ( QoL ) understand role inflammation cytokine development maintenance CRF , well increase knowledge respect cost-effectiveness rehabilitation program . This evaluated newly diagnose breast , colorectal prostate cancer patient adjuvant therapy three different center Sweden ; Uppsala , Lund/Malmö Linköping one Norway . More specifically , investigator ' objective : 1 . Investigate effect high intensity training compare low intensity training patient report outcome ( CRF primary endpoint ) , chemotherapy/radiation completion rate , medical ( oncology ) adverse effect , physical activity daily function , adjuvant treatment long-term-follow . In addition , effect course disease ( e.g time relapse ) . 2 . Investigate supplemental behavioural medicine support strategy increase adherence exercise adjuvant therapy increase maintenance physical activity behaviour decrease sedentary time long run . 3 . Explore role change inflammatory marker cytokine related physical training follow train investigate whether serve mediator effect physical training CRF QoL . 4 . Pursue investigation direct role cytokine secrete work muscle , inhibit cancer cell growth induce apoptosis . 5 . Evaluate health economic issue ; cost effectiveness intervention , health production individual wellbeing . In Phys-Can , investigator implement rigorously design adequately power randomized longitudinal multicenter clinical trial , physical training behavioral medicine support intervention . The highly multi- interdisciplinary international consortium behind proposal excellent position perform international interdisciplinary competence- network-building activity generate valid , high quality data cover area include project , basic biomedical data patient report outcomes ( PROs ) , i.e . bench bedside . This unique health care science . Study design A 2x2 factorial design use . With design investigator study main effect interaction factor ( group ) . Patients randomize one follow group ; A ) individually tailor high intensity training twice week ( H+BM ) without behavioral medicine support strategy ( H ) B ) individually tailor low intensity training twice week ( L+BM ) without behavioral medicine support strategy ( L ) . Study sample/procedure Patients , recently diagnose breast cancer , colorectal cancer prostate cancer schedule adjuvant therapy Uppsala , Lund/Malmö , Linköping Haukeland University hospital consecutively include study . Based power calculation , 612 patient include . All patient exercise twice week 6 month equal extensive adjuvant treatment period . It also optimal period achieve physical training effect establish physical activity behavior . Physical training guidance train coach offer twice week . Training intensity 40-50 % ( low intensity group ) 80-90 % ( high intensity group ) maximal cardiorespiratory fitness/muscular strength . Physical training session consist cardiorespiratory resistance exercise . Every four week , progress resistance training evaluate mean strength test , absolute intensity adjust accordingly Motivational self-regulatory behavioral medicine support strategy ( motivational self-regulatory strategy ) provide H+BM L+BM group i.e . strategy enhance engagement high low intensity exercise program respectively , maintain health enhance physical activity completion program .</detailed_description>
