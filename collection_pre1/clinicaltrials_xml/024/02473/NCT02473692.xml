	<detailed_description>Objective 1 . To examine feasibility user usage patterns/demand online intervention design enhance adherence optimize abortive medication-use migraineurs . Goal 1 : To evaluate practical utility Internet-based user environment host intervention design increase knowledge facilitate adherence optimize abortive medication use . Hypothesis 1A : That Internet-based user environment appropriately suit deliver adherence intervention , turn , could make widely accessible readily employ . Hypothesis 1B : That high proportion patient refer adherence facilitation Web site actually visit make use adherence intervention Web site . Hypothesis 1C : That Web-based intervention initiate , low attrition rate observe majority patient complete intervention . Objective 2 . To examine efficacy online adherence facilitation medication optimization intervention increase knowledge optimal abortive medication-use . Goal 2 : To conduct pilot trial examine efficacy adherence medication optimization intervention improve knowledge medication-use behavior wide range migraine sufferer . Hypothesis 2A : That patient complete Web-based intervention demonstrate improve knowledge optimal abortive medication strategy post-treatment knowledge maintain follow-up .
