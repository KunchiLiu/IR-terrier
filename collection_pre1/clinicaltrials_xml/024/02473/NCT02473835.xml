	<brief_summary>Overweight obesity major problem complication cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes mellitus pose great burden healthcare system . There accumulate evidence support obesity chronic inflammatory disorder mediate part expansion adipose ( fat ) tissue . In addition adipocytes ( fat cell ) , adipose tissue contain whole range cell type include immune ( white blood ) cell . The relative proportion immune cell subpopulation interaction different cell type within adipose tissue may important development type 2 diabetes . Previous research investigator suggest may important difference activation status certain immune cell locate adipose tissue increase overweight production leptin - appetite regulate hormone . Properties adipose tissue inflammatory cell locate within may therefore sensitive change nutritional status . The purpose present study investigate change T cell activation adipose tissue alongside immunometabolic property short period diet compare change blood . Participants include male age 35-55 year old meet criterion inclusion . After take preliminary measurement monitor normal daily activity , participant reduce calorie intake 50 % normal intake/requirements 3 consecutive day attend 1 session Laboratory test 1 period take place Physiology Laboratories University Bath . It hop investigate immunometabolic response within adipose tissue follow acute nutritional challenge help lead good understand development disease associate overweight ultimately help development effective method prevention treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim research investigate whether immunometabolic property adipose tissue inflammatory cell locate within modify short term change nutritional status . Following advertisement study , interested potential participant ask contact Chief Investigator information via email/telephone correspondence . There initial assessment eligibility base inclusion/exclusion criterion , requirement meet , potential participant invite meeting discuss trial . After read participant information sheet see flowchart outline timeline study , would like take part , ask sign consent form . Dates schedule preliminary anthropometric measurement , 1 week diet physical activity monitor 3 day calorie restriction trial date either side . Preliminary measurement : Preliminary test include anthropometric measurement height , weight , waist hip circumference , sagittal waist height blood pressure . Participants also body composition precisely assess use dual energy X-ray absorptiometer ( DEXA ) . These measurement take place University Bath Physiology Laboratories . Monitoring energy balance : For 1 week , participant fit physical activity monitor ( Actiheart™ ) ask record correspond diary physical activity period aid interpretation allow accurate calculation average daily activity energy expenditure . Participants also ask record food drink intake period correspond energy intake period analyse thus 'energy balance ' estimate . Participants make conscious change normal lifestyle habits/routines period . This analysis use write 'diet prescription ' 3 day ensure participant receive 50 % 'normal ' calorie intake use food would normally consume . Main trial day 1 : In 2 day prior first main trial day , participant refrain perform strenuous physical activity . In 24 hour prior , participant also refrain consume alcohol caffeine . Participants arrive Physiology Resting Laboratory morning follow 10 hour fast ( approximately 8 ) blood pressure measure saliva sample collect . A cannula insert forearm vein baseline blood sample ( ) take analysis metabolic/inflammatory marker isolation T cell . A fat sample also obtain use needle aspiration technique . The participant ask consume glucose drink consist 75 g anhydrous glucose ( 113 mL Polycal 87 mL water ) cannula blood sample take every 15 minute follow 2 hour . Intervention - 3 day calorie restriction : For follow 3 day , participant instruct consume diet calculate 50 % 'normal ' energy intake reduce proportion normal diet consume . No strenuous physical activity perform participant last 2 day 3 day period final day intervention , caffeine alcohol consume . Main trial day 2 : The following day 3 day calorie restriction , participant arrive laboratory time main trial day 1 ( minimise variation time sample collection ) undergo exactly procedure . Analysis : On day trial whole blood analyse white blood cell count . Plasma serum sample extract whole blood via centrifugation store −80 degree C. Monocytes T lymphocytes ( population white blood cell ) also isolated whole blood store later assess change proportion activation follow calorie restriction period . In fat sample , separate portion either adipose tissue adipocytes ( isolated cell within adipose tissue use digestion method ) culture medium collect late investigation . The remain cell adipose tissue ( SVF ) also store later analysis cell population activation use flow cytometry , expression/secretion analysis . mRNA expression also examine adipose tissue .</detailed_description>
