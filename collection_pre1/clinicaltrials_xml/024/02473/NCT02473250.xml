	<brief_summary>This study subject diagnosis bipolar disorder depression time recruitment . It involve brain imaging MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) PET scan ( positron emission tomography ) treatment antidepressant . The medication involve add SSRI ( either celexa/citalopram prozac/fluoxetine ) mood stabilizer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prediction Clinical Response SSRI Treatment Bipolar Disorder Using Serotonin 1A Receptor PET Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder associate alteration chemical brain , include one name serotonin . Treatment depression bipolar disorder accomplish increase serotonin function medication name selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI 's ) . Serotonin signal brain occur receptor way similar lock key , serotonin key receptor lock . One important receptor serotonin 1A ( 5-HT1A ) receptor . This receptor find abnormal bipolar disorder period depression , measure type brain imaging call positron emission tomography ( PET ) . The amount brain 5-HT1A receptor measure imaging also associate well depressed patient major depressive disorder respond SSRI medication . This project measure 5-HT1A receptor bipolar depressed individual use PET radiotracer [ 11C ] -CUMI-101 evaluate ability brain image signal predict patient respond SSRI treatment add mood stabilizer .</detailed_description>
