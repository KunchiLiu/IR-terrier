	<brief_title>The Serotonin Transporter Availability Prognosing Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) Treatment Detecting MDD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Serotonin transporter ( SERT ) play important role pathophysiology psychiatric disorder anxiety depression primary target selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) posit exert effect treat psychiatric disorder aforementioned mechanism . I-123-ADAM selective radioligand image SERT use SPECT . Research show display extremely high bind affinity SERT sit . Previous literature also suggest potential role I-123-ADAM SPECT useful understand serotonin system affect depression . This study aim evaluate SERT availability mean I-123-ADAM SPECT imaging study drug-free subject prognosing MDD treatment assist detect MDD . Methods : We enrol patient major depressive disorder free prior antidepressant medication least 5 time elimination half-lives healthy control . The patient major depressive disorder ( N=28 ) receive I-123-ADAM SPECT pharmacological intervention Sertraline HCl treatment period six week . All healthy subject ( N=27 ) basal I-123-ADAM SPECT . The relationship improvement depressive symptom basal SERT availability prognosis MDD subject treat Sertraline HCl analyze . In addition , association efficacy treatment Sertraline HCl change SERT availability also investigate . The control group select order distinguish difference basal SERT bind potential I-123-ADAM healthy MDD subject .</detailed_description>
