	<criteria>Male female age 18 65 year , inclusive . Be good general health determine medical history , physical examination Screening investigation , take regular medication . A body mass index ( BMI ) range 18 30 kg/m2 , inclusive , weigh 50 100 kg , inclusive . BMI calculate weight [ kg ] / ( height [ ] ) *2 . Female subject must nonchildbearing potential follow : Must postmenopausal ( last menstrual period least 12 month Screening , follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] test Screening confirms postmenopausal status ) ; Must surgically sterile undergone hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral salpingectomy and/or bilateral tubal ligation . Willing comply study restriction , include use contraception , concomitant medication dietary lifestyle restriction . Possessing sufficient intelligence understand nature study hazard participate , ability communicate satisfactorily Investigator participate , comply requirement , entire study . Have give write consent participate reading ICF , opportunity discus study Investigator his/her delegate . Have give write consent his/her data enter The Overvolunteering Prevention System . Clinically relevant abnormal history , physical finding , ECG find laboratory value could interfere objective study safety subject . Presence history acute chronic illness , include ( limited ) liver kidney disease , hypertension , seizure , know impairment endocrine , specific bodyorgan dysfunction . Presence history severe adverse reaction medicine . Presence history malignant disease . Acute chronic infectious disease , include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus C virus ( HCV ) infection . Surgery ( eg , stomach bypass ) medical condition might affect absorption medicine . Significant illness within 4 week dose study medication . Participation another clinical trial new chemical entity prescription medicine within previous 3 month , unwilling abstain participate clinical trial study 3 month receipt study medication . Participation another clinical study DS1971a . Blood pressure ( BP ) heart rate semisupine position Screening examination outside range 90 140 mmHg systolic , 40 90 mmHg diastolic ; heart rate 40 100 beats/min . Subjects Stage 1 hypertension ( systolic 140 160 mmHg ; diastolic 90 100 mmHg ) may enrol provide evidence endorgan damage , diabetes 10 year cardiovascular risk &gt; 20 % . Abnormal ECG waveform morphology Screening would preclude accurate measurement uncorrected QT interval ( QT ) duration . QT interval heart rate correct use Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) interval duration &gt; 430 msec men &gt; 450 msec woman , obtain average measurement duplicate Screening ECGs . Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m*2 absolute creatinine value upper limit normal range . eGFR estimate Screening use Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation . Poor metaboliser genotype status CYP2C9 CYP2C19 ( Note : exclusion criterion ensure study population sensitive metabolic interaction ) . Use prescription medicine , counter ( OTC ) medication , herbal remedy ( St John 's Wort ) , food know strong inhibitor strong inducer CYP enzyme ( also know CYP450 enzyme ) 30 day dose study medication ; use prescription OTC medicine , include dietary supplement herbal remedy , 7 day first dose study medication . Consumption certain food beverage dose throughout study period . Loss 400 mL blood plasma , platelet blood component 3 month first dose study medication , unwilling abstain study 3 month receipt study medication . Abuse drug alcohol past , intake 21 unit alcohol weekly ( men ) 14 unit alcohol weekly ( woman ) . Use tobacco product nicotine contain product 3 month dose study medication . Likely possibility subject cooperate requirement protocol . Objection General Practitioner subject enter study .</criteria>
