	<detailed_description>This phase I , randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled safety , illness , infection study new experimental human challenge stock Norovirus genogroup II , genotype 2 ( GII.2 ) isolate designate Snow Mountain virus ( SMV ) , administer healthy adult 18-49 year age . Groups 11 subject admit inpatient hospital research unit , challenge live SMV placebo oral administration , remain isolation unit least 4 day follow challenge . The study duration 18-24 month . Subjects follow post-challenge safety , reactogenicity , illness ( primary objective ) , secondary exploratory objective include infection immune response . There multiple clinical assessment collection blood , emesis , saliva , stool specimen . The primary objective evaluate safety reactogenicity GII.2 Snow Mountain norovirus challenge stock determine safe optimal challenge dose GII.2 Snow Mountain norovirus achieve illness high proportion subject . The secondary objective determine rate infection study participant norovirus GII.2 challenge , determine quantity duration virus shed stool RT-qPCR , conduct time-to-event analysis estimate median time cessation shed use Kaplan-Meier method , determine modify Vesikari score measure gastroenteritis severity , determine GII.2 Snow Mountain norovirus-specific Immunoglobulin titer ELISA challenge , determine effect pre-existing GII.2 Snow Mountain norovirus-specific immunoglobulin serum saliva rate infection , determine total GII.2 Snow Mountain norovirus-specific IgA- IgG-Secreting Cells circulation ELISpot assay , optimal challenge dose determine secretor positive subject : investigate safety illness rate use dose GII.2 challenge stock secretor negative subject .</detailed_description>
