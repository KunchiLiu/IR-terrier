	<brief_summary>Background : - Gene therapy way treat prevent disease use gene . It monitor closely regulators long-term , unexpected side effect . NIH require try contact people treat gene therapy least annually 15 year . This see bad side effect . This trial include therapy patient previously treat gene-therapy trial NCI Experimental Transplantation Immunology Branch longer enrol original gene therapy clinical trial . Objective : - To collect long-term follow-up data people gene transfer study . This follow-up required regulator . Eligibility : - People age 18 old previous NCI Experimental Transplantation Immunology Branch gene therapy research study . Design : - After get genetically modify cell , participant : - Have blood drawn 3 , 6 , 12 month later . - Have annual clinic visit next 4 year . They physical exam . They answer question sign neurological , autoimmune , blood disorder , new cancer . Blood &lt; TAB &gt; may draw . - Be call email annually next 10 year . They answer health question . Blood sample may need take . - Participants ask current address phone number . They also ask address phone number 1 2 people know whereabouts . One family member possible , - At time participant death , researcher request permission family autopsy .</brief_summary>
