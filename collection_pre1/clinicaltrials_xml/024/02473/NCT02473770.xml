	<brief_summary>Background : - Disasters like earthquake , flood , oil spill give people health problem . Workers respond disaster ( like police firefighter ) directly expose contaminant emergency response . So could greatest risk problem . Researchers want gather data worker right go disaster . They hope help understand health effect disaster . Objectives : - To answer question health effect disaster exposure . To create participant registry collect biological sample health data . Eligibility : - People least 21 year age send disaster area emergency response . Design : - Participants 1 study visit . - Participants answer question : - Contact information - Health , lifestyle , emotion - Medical history - Disaster response activity - Things expose environment - Participants may blood collected vein arm . - Participants may give biological sample . These may urine , saliva , cheek cell , nail clipping , hair . - Participants short physical exam . They may hip waist measured clothes . The amount oxygen blood may measure sensor finger ear . - Participants may lung function test . They take deep breath exhale strongly . - Participants ask agree contact later update contact data learn future study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Acquisition Pre- Post-Incident Disaster Data</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disasters frequently associate environmental exposure socioeconomic disruption may lead short- long-term health consequence . Disaster response worker potentially great risk adverse outcome due direct exposure hazardous environmental contaminant emergency response process . The importance conduct disaster responder research immediate aftermath disaster become widely recognize , numerous barrier also recognize . The Rapid Acquisition Pre- Post-Incident Disaster Data ( RAPIDD ) protocol aim address gap register characterize cohort disaster response worker early disaster response phase obtain baseline characteristic . Disaster response worker deploy disaster area conduct emergency response activity target enrollment . Disaster responder may include police , fire , emergency medical personnel , well responder group public health personnel worker involve environmental remediation restoration activity . The primary objective RAPIDD study create research registry comprise disaster response worker rostered immediately deployment disaster area . Important secondary aim administer questionnaire collect biological sample characterize cohort manner allow future prospective analysis association disaster exposures health outcome . In order achieve aim , develop protocol , operational manual , questionnaire , data collection system , train plan , tool reduce time require initiate disaster research . We also obtain scientific regulatory approval protocol advance disaster hope expedite amendment , clarification research , minimize delay associate various review cycle . In order characterize cohort prior involvement response activity could lead disaster-related exposure , attempt collect wide range questionnaire data , clinical measurement biological sample . Questionnaires may cover topic include contact information , demographic , socioeconomic status , medical history , current physical mental health status , occupational exposure , alcohol tobacco use lifestyle factor . Biological specimen collect may include follow : blood , urine , nail clipping , saliva , buccal cell hair . Clinical measurement may include vital sign , anthropometric measurement spirometry . By seek IRB regulatory approval carry research advance , anticipate able submit expedite amendment clarify research plan specific disaster research initiate early response phase . However , early phase disaster situation , may safe feasible collect data need fully characterize cohort response worker . In situation , data collection may limit rostering limited self-collection biospecimens . As response effort stabilize becomes know potential exposure related adverse health outcome , intend expand data collection effort , seek expedite regulatory approval .</detailed_description>
