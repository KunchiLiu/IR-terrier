	<brief_title>Correlation Between Placental Thickness Second Third Trimester Fetal Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator make certain appropriate inform consent process place ensure potential research subject , authorize representative , fully inform nature objective study , potential risk benefit study participation , right research subject . All laboratory specimen , evaluation form , report , video recording , record leave site include unique personal data maintain subject confidentiality . All patient provide informed write consent fully instruct investigation.The study approve ethical committee Ain Shams University . All recruit woman observe 1st trimester screen antenatal clinic assess baseline demographic obstetric data include age , parity , body mass index ( BMI ) past medical event . Smoking , alcohol drug use also determine . At second third trimester ( 15-20 30-34 week gestation respectively ) , maternal weight , weight gain , BMI , BMI gain data ultrasound examination record . At time delivery assessment maternal weight mention , birth weight ( gram ) , fetal sex , mode delivery take . All pregnant woman underwent ultrasound evaluation placental thickness time second trimester ( 15-20 week gestation ) well third trimester ( 30-34 week gestation ) . All sonographic examination perform trans-abdominal use Medison X4 ultrasound machine Trans abdominal4.0 megahertz ( MHz ) probe The Special Care Center Fetus Unit Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital . The placental thickness measure place ultrasound transducer perpendicularly plane placenta , area cord insertion , near mid-placental portion describe Hoddick et al.12 . Each evaluation perform one two experienced sonographers hospital minimum inter- intra-observer variability . After delivery , placenta weigh gram previously describe Azpurua et al.2 . Fetal weight ( primary objective ) neonatal status morbidity include baby Apgar score , fetal distress fetal death admission neonatal intensive care unit also determine . All examination data record perform two senior resident physician . ( secondary objective )</detailed_description>
