	<brief_summary>This study randomize control cross trial exercise train taxane-containing chemotherapy treatment breast cancer . Forty-three woman stage I-III breast cancer randomize immediate delay thrice weekly exercise train 8-12 week . The immediate exercise group exercise taxane chemotherapy delay group start exercise 2 week completion treatment . This design allow assessment effect exercise vs usual care treatment , plus comparison training response vs. chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose The purpose study evaluate effect aerobic resistance exercise training relative usual care taxane-containing chemotherapy treatment breast cancer . Hypotheses Relative usual care , aerobic resistance exercise train taxane-containing chemotherapy treatment breast cancer : 1. mitigate experience patient report outcomes 2. reduce medical management taxane side effect adverse event 3. attenuate autonomic dysfunction maintain rest cardiovascular function cardiovascular response exercise 4 ) Objectives The primary aim study determine whether aerobic resistance exercise train taxane-containing chemotherapy treatment reduce patient-reported side effect , medical management clinical adverse event report relative usual care . The secondary aim determine whether aerobic resistance exercise train taxane-containing chemotherapy attenuate occurrence index autonomic dysfunction relative usual care . 5 ) Research method This study randomize control trial crossover . The intervention consist aerobic , resistance balance training three time week . Forty-three woman stage I-III breast cancer diagnosis schedule receive taxane-containing chemotherapy randomize immediate delay exercise ( stratified treatment protocol ) . Potential participant refer oncologist referral , self-referred recruitment poster , social medium word mouth . 6 ) Statistical analysis The primary outcome measure EORTC CIPN subscale patient-reported symptom relate neurotoxic chemotherapy . Secondary outcome measure include measure autonomic dysfunction include heart rate blood pressure variability , medical management taxane-related side effect , clinical adverse event related treatment . The chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) sub-scale EORTC Quality life Questionnaire use primary outcome measure determine sample size . G*Power 3.0.10 use estimate sample size independent t-tests two group ( 2-week post chemotherapy time point ) . At thirty-six participant , 80 % power detect medium ( d=0.6 ) effect size EORTC CIPN-20 subscale alpha 0.05 ( one-tailed ) . An additional 20 % recruit allow dropout non-adherence , make final total sample size goal 43 participant . Baseline characteristic outcome measure two group compare independent t-tests . To assess effect exercise intervention treatment , independent t-tests use compare outcome measure two week post completion taxane chemotherapy difference exist group baseline measure . For exercise group , outcome measure time point 2 compare time point 3 use pair t-tests assess maintenance time . Independent t-tests first use determine whether significant difference exist group three exploratory measure time point . If difference exist , data combine , analyze repeat measure analysis variance determine whether difference exist .</detailed_description>
