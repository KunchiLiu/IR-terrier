	<brief_title>Varenicline Treatment Excessive Daytime Sleepiness Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance common Parkinson 's disease include excessive daytime sleepiness report 50 % patient . Relatively little therapeutic research address problem excessive daytime sleepiness current treatment largely aim reduce dose dopaminergic medication try maintain sufficient motor control unfortunately often fail . Apart degeneration dopaminergic neuron , decrease cholinergic projection brain arousal area may least partly responsible occurrence excessive daytime sleepiness Parkinson 's disease . Smoking narcoleptic patient diminishes sleep attack excessive daytime sleepiness , thus one may hypothesize nicotinergic stimulation brain arousal area may improve excessive daytime sleepiness Parkinson 's disease . Therefore effect varenicline , alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor partial agonist , excessive daytime sleepiness Parkinson 's disease study placebo-controlled cross-over study .</detailed_description>
