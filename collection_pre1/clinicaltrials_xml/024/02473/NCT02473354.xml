	<brief_summary>Purpose Study : ( 1 ) To classify individual subject 's ventilatory response term respiratory depression bolus remifentanil normoxic hyperoxic condition . ( 2 ) Measurement specific respiratory parameter predict opioid-induced respiratory depression ( OIRD ) response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictors Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression ( OIRD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use FDA approve drug ( remifentanil , oxygen carbon dioxide ) investigational manner study also develop diagnostic test currently investigational . Investigational mean FDA approve use drug manner diagnostic test develop . Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression ( OIRD ) recognize potentially life threaten cause substantial morbidity ( poor health ) mortality ( death ) . Respiratory depression amount breathe minute fall normal . Opioids medication widely use treat acute ( lasting hour day ) chronic ( lasting month ) pain , within outside hospital setting . Opioids use outside prescribed circumstance result misuse abuse . Even within control environment acute hospital care difficult identify individual risk OIRD , many possess physical characteristic , obesity obstructive sleep apnea ( stop breathing duringsleep ) , may predispose OIRD . In absence ability easily identify at-risk individual Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation suggest patient receive opioids must consider risk OIRD therefore require appropriate monitoring . Even fully awake , normal response breathe gas mixture contain carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) increase amount breathe . The effect similar breathe paper bag . This call Hypercapnic Ventilatory Response ( HCVR ) measure . Not everyone respond identical manner - difference HCVR one person next . But individual 's baseline HCVR measure , change baseline also measure . This study do : ( 1 ) classify rate individual subject 's ventilatory ( breathe ) response term respiratory depression bolus potent opioid ( similar morphine , often refer narcotic ) . The opioid use study Remifentanil commonly use operating room . Remifentanil give normoxic ( breathe room air [ 21 % Oxygen ] ) hyperoxic ( breathe 50 % oxygen ) condition ( 2 ) determine measurement specific respiratory parameter predict OIRD response .</detailed_description>
