	<detailed_description>This study consist 2 phase : IGIV-C Run-in Phase Corticosteroid Tapering/IGIV-C Maintenance Phase . In Run-in Phase , subject receive total 3 dos IGIV-C ( 1 load dose 2 g/kg 2 maintenance dos 1 g/kg ) maintain stable dose corticosteroid . In CS Tapering/IGIV-C Maintenance Phase , subject continue 1 g/kg IGIV-C begin prescribe CS taper regimen CS dose decrease every 3 week . Approximately 60 subject plan enrol study across multiple center North America Europe . The total duration study participation subject 45 week .</detailed_description>
