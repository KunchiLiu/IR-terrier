	<brief_summary>Research goal include evaluate relative impact maternal nutritional status versus recent dietary intake breast milk micronutrient composition , evaluate impact maternal lipid base nutrient supplement ( LNS ) breast milk micronutrient composition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Term Response Breast Milk Micronutrient Concentrations Lipid Based Nutrient Supplement Guatemalan Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include cross sectional interventional component . Maternal dietary intake nutritional status compare breast milk micronutrient composition cross sectional manner . The short term effect maternal dietary intake breast milk micronutrient composition examine use intervention control diet LNS . Infants test-weighed LNS intervention order calculate infant micronutrient intake control LNS intervention day . Mother-infant dyad recruit study order receive 3 treatment randomize . All mother receive treatment . The mother invite clinic 4 separate occasion . During first study visit , maternal blood collect , anthropometric index assess , food frequency demographic characteristic survey administer . During 2-4 visit , LNS intervention take place . Mothers arrive clinic fast , fast milk collection occur . Subsequently , mother provide 3 meal base local food low-nutrient density . Milk collect 8 hour infant feed ( ad libitum ) . A 24 hour dietary recall conduct . Mothers receive 1 ) LNS , 2 ) A single dose LNS breakfast , 3 ) A single dose LNS split 3 part meal throughout day . Infants test weigh feed calculate nutrient intake breast milk impact different supplementation scheme nutrient intake .</detailed_description>
