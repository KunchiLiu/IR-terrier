	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate clinical colour vision assessment fit best preschool child school child . The investigator go investigate child know colour vision affect ocular disease , well healthy child without colour vision deficiency . The goal compare usability validity three different clinical test colour vision assessment already well establish adult yet child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Different Color Vision Tests Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colour vision important part visual perception . There exist hereditary acquire form colour vision deficiency . Hereditary form affect 8 % male 0.4 % female . Acquired form occur due disease affect retina , optic nerve part brain involve colour vision optic tract visual cortex . Early diagnosis colour vision deficiency especially important child provide prompt aid parent , teacher person take care . Moreover colour vision deficiency early sign begin progressive ocular disease . Colour vision assessment part standard clinical test ophthalmology . In child , colour vision assessment difficult , test develop adult . The investigator go investigate suitability test child . It plan investigate 40 child without colour vision deficiency 40 child know colour vision deficiency . The data collection take 1 year . The study involve ophthalmologic examination assessment 3 different colour vision test . All examination non-invasive , perform last total 1 1.5 hour . The visual acuity assess eye chart refraction measurement follow slit lamp examination front section eye optical examination eyeground . The three coulour vision test part standard repertoire Institute ophthalmology University hospital Zürich . Each colour vision test perform test run twice study examination . In first test child ask recognize known geometrical figure picture chart . The second test involve recognition color cap third test computer-assisted examination child denote position colour area screen . In child know optical disease perform additionally optical coherence tomography quantify disease base morphological change retinal layer . Therefore pupil dilate application specific eye drops medication . This lead transient decrease visual acuity 2-4 hour . The child drive bicycle time interval . The principal Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) similar medical ultrasonics . However OCT , use light wave instead ultrasound wave , allow exact examination retinal cell layer . All examination perform study standardize procedure Institute Ophthalmology University hospital Zürich . No risks harm expect relation plan examination . No payment ask study related examination . Neither patient health insurance arise additional cost related participation study .</detailed_description>
