	<criteria>Adult male female 18 year age . Clinical diagnosis RP , base upon one following : clinical feature , electrophysiological measure genetic testing , available ( genetic confirmation obligatory ) . Best correct Visual acuity 20/200 worse study eye ( N.B . patient differ acuity eye , bad eye enrol study eye ) . Medically able undergo vitrectomy subretinal injection , surgery may require general anesthesia . Good general health define : Normal serum chemistry hematology . Out normal range laboratory finding deem clinical significant acceptable . No history malignancy , except nonmelanoma skin cancer ; premalignant condition cancer situ . Negative serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B ( HBV ) , hepatitis C ( HCV ) Female patient childbearing potential must use reliable method contraception ( e.g . oral contraceptive condom , intrauterine device ( IUD ) condom , diaphragm spermicide condom ) study . Females childbearing potential must confirm negative pregnancy test time treatment . Males must willing use barrier spermicide contraception study . Ability give write informed consent evidence signature patient consent form , communicate well investigator comply expectation study . The presence ocular disease ocular medium opacity , opinion investigator , precludes accurate evaluation study . Prior vitrectomy study eye Patients history amblyopia exclude High myopia ( &gt; 6 diopter ) study eye Cataract surgery study within 3 month Participation within 6 month clinical trial involve drug device treatment No prior stem cell injection part body Use systemic immunosuppressive agent six month prior treatment</criteria>
