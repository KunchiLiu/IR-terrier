	<brief_title>Patient-Centered Pain Care Using Artificial Intelligence Mobile Health Tools</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) one effective treatment chronic low back pain . However , half Veterans access train CBT therapist , program expansion costly . Moreover , VA CBT program consist 10 weekly hour-long session deliver use approach out-of-sync stepped-care model design ensure scarce resource use effectively efficiently possible . Data prior CBT trial document substantial variation patient ' need extend treatment , characteristic effective program vary significantly . Some patient improve first session others need extensive contact . After initially establish behavioral plan , still Veterans may able reach behavioral symptom goal use personalized combination manual , short follow-up contact therapist , automate telephone monitoring self-care support call . In partnership National Pain Management Program , investigator propose apply state-of-the-art principle `` reinforcement learning '' ( field artificial intelligence AI use successfully robotics on-line consumer target ) develop evidence-based , personalized CBT pain management service automatically adapt Veteran 's unique change need ( AI-CBT ) . AI-CBT use feedback patient progress pain-related functioning measure daily via pedometer step-counts automatically personalize intensity type patient support ; thereby ensure scarce therapist resource use efficiently possible potentially allow program fix budget serve many Veterans . The specific aim study : ( 1 ) demonstrate AI-CBT non-inferior pain-related outcome compare standard telephone CBT ; ( 2 ) document AI-CBT achieves outcomes efficient use scarce clinician resource evidence less overall therapist time increase use VA health service ; ( 3 ) demonstrate intervention 's impact proximal outcomes associate treatment response , include program engagement , pain management skill acquisition , satisfaction care , patient ' likelihood dropout . The investigator use qualitative interview patient , clinician , VA operational partner ensure service feature maximize scalability , broad scale adoption , impact . 278 patient chronic low back pain recruit VA Connecticut Healthcare System VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System , randomized standard 10-sessions telephone CBT versus AI-CBT . All patient begin weekly hour-long telephone counseling , patient AI-CBT group , demonstrate significant treatment response step less resource-intensive alternative hour-long contact , include : ( ) 15 minute contact therapist , ( b ) CBT clinician feedback provide via interactive voice response call ( IVR ) . The AI engine learn work best term patient ' personally-tailored treatment plan base daily feedback via IVR patient ' pedometer-measured step count well CBT skill practice physical functioning . The AI algorithm investigator use design efficient possible , system learn work best give patient base collective experience similar patient well individual 's history . The investigator 's hypothesis AI-CBT result pain-related functional outcome bad ( possibly well ) standard approach , scale back intensity contact result marginal gain pain control , AI-CBT approach significantly less costly term therapy time . Secondary hypothesis AI-CBT result great patient engagement patient satisfaction . Outcomes measure three six month post recruitment include pain-related interference , treatment satisfaction , treatment dropout .</detailed_description>
