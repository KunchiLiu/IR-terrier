	<brief_summary>No treatment exist Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) cell loss late wet AMD dry AMD . The differentiation RPE cell patient derive iPSC offer valuable source tissue transplantation form AMD may form basis future treatment option term cell transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Production iPSC Derived RPE Cells Transplantation AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It show adult human skin cell human blood cell reprogrammed become stem cell . This type stem cell call induced Pluripotent Stem Cell ( iPSC ) .It show specifically type stem cell produce adult human skin cell blood cell turn convert Retinal Pigment Epithelial ( RPE ) cell . These RPE cell important cell type human retina abnormal ultimately lose Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) . Although show possible make RPE cell adult human skin , do level fulfil regulatory requirement human transplantation AMD . This feasibility study involve 10 patient . The efficiency create iPSC-Derived RPE cell patient 's skin blood examine . A sample size 10 patient allow u potentially consolidate safety efficacy method order create cell within context future transplantation trial .</detailed_description>
