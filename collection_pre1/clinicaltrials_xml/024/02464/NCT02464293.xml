	<brief_title>A Pilot Evaluation Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy People With Huntington 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Huntingdon 's disease ( HD ) genetic neurodegenerative condition cause problem movement , coordination cognitive functioning , emotional difficulty also commonly experience . It believe affect around five ten 100,000 people European descent , recent UK estimate high 11.2-13.5 . Each child affect person 50 % chance inherit condition . As age diagnosis typically around 35-55 , time diagnosis death around 20 year , diagnose often see parent affected condition . Many people various stage HD ( include carry gene pre-symptomatic ) experience low mood , anxiety psychological difficulty . Indeed , alongside functional capacity , mood may one main factor contribute health relate quality life , discrete motor problem , cognitive impairment . In addition , report patient suggest emotional social concern important individual condition pre-symptomatic stage , concern remain throughout disease course . Medication may effective alleviate psychological difficulty people , efficacy conclusively proven suitable . Psychological intervention may provide alternative additional way alleviate distress . Although commonly presumed biological factor main determinant psychological distress people HD , several study indicate , may indeed important , psychological factor also significant . For example belief disease cop mechanism associate poor mental health high level depression . Such psychological belief cop pattern adaptively change use psychological intervention , example cognitive-based psychological therapy . Little progress report development psychological intervention HD despite fact people HD express interest psychological approach currently successfully developed people neurological condition ( e.g. , people Parkinson 's disease ) . It therefore propose pilot mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT ) , although originally develop help people remit depression relapse , increasingly use help people current difficulty . It also pilot people Parkinson 's disease find acceptable intervention report improvement self-management psychological wellbeing . In general , MBCT also record gain include improved sleep quality social functioning . It also receive sufficient evidence recommend approach UK NICE guideline people history depression . MBCT also reduce anxiety provide group support . There also indication mindfulness train improve neurocognitive functioning , even people neurodegenerative disease . Finally , psychological therapy subgroup within European Huntington 's Disease Network recently form , thus indicate rise interest psychological approach timely nature work . Hence study provide first indication whether MBCT , therapeutic approach establish evidence base , would acceptable useful people HD . In order meet aim , MBCT deliver two group , one individual carry gene pre-symptomatic one individual begin experience symptom early stage disease course . Approaches outcome evaluation incremental , low cost study , e.g. , qualitative investigation case study , conduct investment randomise control trial consider . Thus study follow guidance collect qualitative quantitative data . The qualitative data analyse use interpretative phenomenological analysis , methodology previously use qualitative study MBCT . Semi-structured interview provide data acceptability intervention detail account participant ' experience intervention provide . This inform whether MBCT intervention need change adapted trial . The quantitative data use provide basic pre post intervention comparison number outcome variable relevant MBCT , hypothesis performance measure improve post training . These data also use estimate effect size trial suitably power . Given considerable physical , cognitive emotional consequence disease , HD affect person HD , also live , even pre-clinical phase . Family member often become caregiver reduce quality life result , include experience low mood . In fact , caregiver burden caregiver depression associate depression person HD , alongside motor disturbance , depression person HD one main predictor caregiver burden . Partners people HD also experience reduce satisfaction relationship , sometimes person HD . Thus study also investigate view family member ( e.g . partner , parent , child ) person participate intervention . As intervention aim alleviate psychological distress person HD , hypothesise turn also effect family member 's wellbeing . Also , high level mindfulness associate high level satisfaction partner relationship , perhaps due adaptive conflict resolution well emotional recognition management . Participants MBCT report increase empathy perspective taking , able respond mindfully relationship . Thus increase mindfulness person HD may benefit family social relationship . In addition , caregiver ' view symptom quality life person HD may always match person HD . Furthermore , certain symptom change beneficial person HD may caregiver , thus caregiver offer alternative perspective wellbeing ( include behavioural psychological change ) person HD . Both qualitative quantitative data collect family member close friend person HD , person available willing take part . Semi-structured interview family member explore perception acceptability intervention experience person HD , well impact family member personally wider family system . Data collect pre post intervention ass change psychological wellbeing , caregiver burden family relationship , hypothesis wellbeing relationship improve post training caregiver burden decrease .</detailed_description>
