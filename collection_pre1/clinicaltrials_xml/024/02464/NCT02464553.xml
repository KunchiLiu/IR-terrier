	<brief_summary>In prospective multi-centre double-blind trial effect X-ray examination control periradicular therapy examine ( approximately 300 ) adult patient low back pain pain cause foraminal stenosis radiculopathy spinal stenosis . A periradicular therapy ( PRT ) special radiological , low-risk therapy chronic back pain cause wear tear cervical , thoracic , lumbar spine herniated disc disc bulge . Partially pain might also radiate hip extremity cause radicular symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EuroPainClinicsÂ® Study I ( Prospective Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Controlled periradicular therapy ( PRT ) microinvasive interventional pain release procedure . Advantage target pain therapy exact administration effective drug nerve root area thoracic , lumbar sacral spine . It use like effective treatment patient radicular pain cause foraminal stenosis radiculopathy spinal stenosis . Spinal stenosis narrow space spine cause pressure spinal cord nerve . Discogenic radicular irritation syndrome usually cause protrusion intervertebral disc prolapse disc . The common lumbar sacral radiculopathy could exactly verify CT magnetic resonance imaging . The big profit best response therapy patient resistant physiotherapy per oral medicament therapy . Intervertebral space verification provide X-ray examination imaging . Than place Tuohy needle insert . Position Tuohy needle verify application low dose contrast . When right position needle secure effective drug administer : local anesthetic - Bupivacaine 0,25 % ( 1-2ml ) together corticosteroid injection -Depo-Medrol ( 40mg ) . PRT involve several medicable effect : anaesthetic - positive effect pain transmission nerve fiber , antichemical - limitation chemical product sequester disc , Anti-edematous - reduction root nerve oedema , antiphlogistic - inhibition phospholipase A2 , antifibrotic - reduction scar production . Trial compare group patient fulfilment inclusion criterion 's undergo microinvasive interventional pain release procedure - PRT . The first group patient undergo PRT procedure intervertebral space responsible skin dermatome pain radiate . Second group patient undergo double PRT procedure intervertebral space responsible skin dermatome pain radiate also intervertebral space usually disc lesion responsible origin pain localize . After first visit ambulance patient study inform . After agreement patient study involve . Specific unique nine digit number assign patient . Then patient randomize group special evaluate software create especially study . Patients agree type PRT ( one level two level ) inform end study . This way patient blind . Second examination provide 6 month . Patients begin introduced doctor unique number . Doctor blind dispose information microinvasive procedure examine patient . Data collect : ( Visual analogue scale , pain radiate dermatome , global pain scale , change analgesics drug consumption ) . All acquire information note special anonymous protocol . Also patient anonymously fulfill Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire . The third examination provide 12 month way . Patients begin introduced doctor unique number . Doctor blind dispose information microinvasive procedure examine patient . Data collect : ( Visual analogue scale , dermatome pain radiating , global pain scale , change analgesics drug consumption ) . All acquire information note special anonymous protocol . Also patient anonymously fulfill Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire ( ODI ) . If patient need see doctor reason deterioration pain feel ODI increase 10 % patient 's origin ODI value one PRT allow spinal space respond pain radiate dermatome first six month patient inclusion trial . Under condition another PRT allow next six month . When ODI increase 10 % patient 's origin ODI value 1 PRT six month interval need , patient exclude study .</detailed_description>
