	<brief_summary>The high rate adverse event , include overdose , result opioid pain medication use threaten quality safety pain care Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) elsewhere critical public health problem United States . Pain highly common condition among VHA patient , opioid therapy constitutes primary mode pain treatment . This study seek address issue conduct randomize controlled trial brief conversation improve opioid safety among Veteran patient receive long-term opioid therapy . Veterans receive opioid therapy pain primary care recruit randomize receive either single session motivational intervention focus safe opioid use equal attention control condition . The primary hypothesis motivational intervention improve opioid safety , decrease risk behavior , aberrant opioid use , total quantity opioids prescribe relative control condition . Study finding inform effort ensure safety well-being Veteran patient pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adverse outcome , include overdose , related opioid use increase represent significant threat safety quality VHA pain care well national public health concern . Efforts underway change opioid prescribing behavior , concurrent strategy need address patient behavior decrease opioid safety thus increase opioid overdose risk . Overdoses result range behavior , include take prescribed , use multiple substance synergistic effect , injecting/snorting crush pill get high . Factors mental health condition find increase risk overdose among Veterans receive opioids pain . Given range risk behavior relevant patient factor , tailor opioid risk reduction strategy urgently need . Motivational enhancement ( ME ) evidence-based strategy use tailor enact behavior change improve self-efficacy motivation . Recent VHA initiatives increase behavioral health provider primary care , Primary Care-Mental Health Integration ( PC-MHI ) , provide clear opportunity deliver ME intervention many patient treat long-term pain primary care . Although impact ME overdose risk behavior unknown , use ME approach improve opioid safety reduce risk behavior potentially well-suited context long-term opioid pain care , total immediate discontinuation opioid use often unfeasible . The propose Prescription Opioid Safety Trial ( POST ) study randomize control trial brief , tailor ME conversation incorporate cognitive behavioral strategy increase pain cop aim improve patient ' opioid safety . The study recruit 450 patient primary care clinic VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System . Patients long-term opioid use , define treatment least 90 day 120+ day supply , prescribe opioid dos 50 morphine-equivalent mg/day great ( indicator overdose risk ) screen recruit study . Participants randomize either intervention ( n = 225 ) enhance usual care ( EUC ) condition ( n = 225 ) . Pharmacy record patient self-report assessed baseline 3- , 6- , 12-month follow-ups measure key outcomes . The specific aim : Aim 1 ) examine patient randomly assign brief opioid safety intervention report reduce overdose risk behavior ( e.g. , high dose , concurrent alcohol use , concurrent drug/medication use , return normal dose break use ) one year follow-up compare patient assign equal attention EUC . Aim 2 ) examine patient randomly assign brief opioid safety intervention lower total quantity opioids prescribe ( pharmacy fill record ) aberrant opioid use ( e.g. , use reason pain , obtain opioids someone primary provider ) one year follow-up compare patient assign equal attention EUC . The study two secondary aim : 1 ) examine patient randomly assign brief intervention few non-fatal overdoses medication-related adverse event ( emergency department visit , over-sedation , injury ) , good functioning , often store dispose opioids safely compare patient assign EUC ; 2 ) examine mediator ( motivation self-efficacy ) moderator ( OIF/OEF/OND status , baseline mental health ) intervention effect .</detailed_description>
