	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) aggressive subtype show high risk locoregional recurrence ( LRR ) distant metastasis ( DM ) . The equivalent impact breast-conserving therapy ( BCT ) mastectomy disease-free survival patient early breast cancer establish number large randomize controlled trial meta-analysis . However , ongoing dispute exist whether TNBC good candidate BCT . PURPOSE : This prospective , randomize , open , single-center Phase III clinical study conduct compare efficacy safety breast-conserving therapy mastectomy treat Chinese patient early TNBC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY POPULATION : Operable patient T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer OBJECTIVES : Primary To assess impact breast-conserving therapy disease-free survival compare mastectomy patient T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer . Secondary To assess impact breast-conserving therapy locoregional recurrence-free survival ( LRRFS ) distant metastasis-free survival ( DMFS ) compare mastectomy patient T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer . OUTLINE : This prospective , randomize , open , single-center Phase III clinical study . Patients undergo either lumpectomy mastectomy surgical axillary staging lesion resect negative margin base result randomization generate computer . Patients stage I II receive adjuvant chemotherapy use TC TAC regimen respectively . Since tumor small 5cm metastatic lymph node less 4 , patient undergo mastectomy receive radiation therapy . On hand , within 4-8 week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo breast-conserving surgery receive radiation therapy follow : ( 1 ) N0 : Radiation therapy whole breast ( +boost tumor bed ) consideration partial breast irradiation select patient ; ( 2 ) N1 : Radiation therapy whole breast ( +boost tumor bed ) , infraclavicular region , supraclavicular area without radiation therapy internal mammary node . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year 6 month year 3-5 .</detailed_description>
