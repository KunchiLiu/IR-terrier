	<brief_summary>Mechanically ventilated patient Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) highly susceptible sleep disruption . Several study last 15 year demonstrate extremely poor sleep quality abnormal sleep pattern evaluate polysomnography ( PSG ) device ( gold standard method evaluate sleep quality quantity ) . Discontinuation mechanical ventilation consider soon possible patient 's condition start improve . A patient 's ability wean mechanical ventilator assess use two step approach include Rapid Shallow Breathing Index ( RSBI ) calculation spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) determine likelihood success failure consider endotracheal extubation . The rate weaning failure first SBT attempt report 35-55 % . The reason wean failure may complex multifactorial . An association sleep disruption wean outcome never study . The goal study look association poor sleep quality failure wean attempt . This study observational , physiological study investigate sleep quality quantity patient wean record standard PSG ( 17:00 08:00 ) night wean attempt . Sleep characteristic patient fail pass wean attempt compare . In addition , compare sleep pattern endotracheal extubation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This clinical physiological study take place period 2-14 day , depend participant . Assessment readiness wean use RSBI calculation SBT standard practice ICU , decision perform one make ICU team . They usually perform morning 08:00 10:00 . The RSBI calculation perform disconnect patient ventilator 2-3 minute measure breathe frequency average tidal volume 1 minute . A value RSBI index &lt; 100-105 breaths/min×L predict possible successful SBT . The SBT perform use flow-by technique ( Pressure Support ( PS ) /Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) 0/0 cmH2O ) 30 120 minute Fraction Inspired Oxygen ( FiO2 ) 0.5 RSBI index &lt; 100-105 breaths/min×L . A T-piece trial give reliable assessment wean capability , often reserve challenging patient . Using flow-by ( PS/CPAP 0/0 cmH2O ) give similar indication wean capability comparison T-piece , allow Respiratory Therapists keep equipment monitor tidal volume minute ventilation throughout test . During SBT , respiratory hemodynamic parameter continuously monitor . Determining success failure SBT perform clinical team . For patient pass SBT , decision extubation make ICU clinical team independently study . For purpose study , daily screen perform afternoon Respiratory Therapist identify patient RSBI calculation SBT follow day . On night prior plan wean assessment , sleep architecture record use standard PSG ( electroencephalography , right left electrooculography , submental electromyography electrocardiography ) 17:00 8:00 . Pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) end-tidal carbon dioxide ( EtCO2 ) transcutaneous partial pressure carbon dioxide ( PtcCO2 ) record continuously PSG . For patient pass RSBI index SBT extubated successfully , PSG record repeat night . If patient pass SBT extubated , wait new extubation attempt within next 48 hour . If extubation perform within next 48 hour , PSG record repeat night extubation . If extubation delay , PSG perform . For patient fail 1st RSBI fail 1st SBT , PSG record repeat night next wean attempt night extubation happen within maximum two week 1st SBT . Assessment delirium perform use Confusion Assessment Method Intensive Care Unit ( CAM-ICU ) twice daily ( 08:00 18:00 ) day 0 extubation .</detailed_description>
