	<brief_summary>In EffTox dose escalation study , 3 dose level test . The optimal dose ( OD ) rSIFN-co determine use EffTox design . Additional subject cohort enrol subject current dose level complete 28 day without DLT . The optimal dose ( OD ) determine evaluation safety cohort disease response RECIST 1.1 8 week . Once OD determine , enrollment continue least 9 subject total accrued OD . Pharmacokinetics rSIFN-co conduct test dose level characterize dose proportionality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The initial cohort 3 subject . Escalation next dose continue unless subject experience DLT , time cohort expand 6 subject . Provided one DLT cohort , dose escalate . However , 2 DLTs cohort 6 subject , previous dose level expand total 9 subject . If none dose level acceptable study completion ( i.e. , &gt; 33 % subject experience DLT ) , OD identify , drug warrant investigation .</detailed_description>
