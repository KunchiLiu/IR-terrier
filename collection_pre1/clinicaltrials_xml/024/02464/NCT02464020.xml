	<brief_summary>The goal study assess oral vancomycin restore normal bile acid metabolism people Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Inflammatory Bowel Disease . Study participant provide blood stool sample order evaluate bile acid metabolism short course vancomycin assess change . The investigator also assess blood stool healthy people , people IBD ( without PSC ) control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Characterize Bile Acid Metabolism Dysbiosis Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ( PSC ) chronic inflammatory fibrotic disease intra extrahepatic duct unknown etiology predominately occur people Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) . One hypothesis alter microbiome ( bacteria gut ) people IBD responsible inflammation liver see PSC . Bile acid ( BAs ) represent unique mechanism communication host intestinal microbiome liver . Synthesized liver , bile acid metabolize intestinal bacteria hydroxylases secondary BAs re-enter portal circulation . Altered metabolism BAs associate gallstone colorectal cancer hypothesize play role inflammatory response certain disease IBD PSC . IBD associate impairment bile acid ( BA ) metabolism . In addition BAs play role regulate bacterial growth intestine thus effect integrity intestinal mucosa , essential component IBD . Perturbations system could increase bacterial translocation portal system due loss protective mucosal factor bacterial overgrowth . The overall goal study ass change BAs metabolism follow administration oral vancomycin . The investigator also describe relationship intestinal microbiome BA metabolism PSC/IBD .</detailed_description>
