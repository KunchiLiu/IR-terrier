	<brief_summary>An estimated 10 percent primary breast , prostate , lung , thyroid renal cell tumor metastasize spine . The majority tumor detect surgical intervention require patient receive radiation therapy symptomatic relief . Complete pain control , duration pain control , high recurrence rate soft tissue complication make radiation less ideal treatment . Also , pre-operative radiation therapy significant negative predictor surgical outcome . To improve treatment option patient advanced cancer spinal lesion research team investigate new minimally invasive therapy know photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) target metastatic spine lesion limit side effect . PDT involve use photo-activated chemotherapeutic agent , give intravenously stimulate non-thermal wavelength-specific light allow selective ablation tumor tissue . The light delivered spine small fiber optic cable use diode laser . By combine canine porcine study investigators strong evidence support PDT safe effective treatment metastatic tumor spine . PDT target , repeatable , minimally invasive limited local systemic side effect . Its use would enhance treatment option patient advanced stage cancer .

	<detailed_description>There 1.5 million case cancer report year North America significant number patient eventually suffer metastasis spine present extremely challenge problem clinician patient . Primary tumor commonly affect spine include breast , prostate , lung , thyroid renal cell cancer . Estimates large clinical series report least 10 percent rate metastasis spine common tumor . These lesion extremely painful significantly affect quality life advance stage cancer patient . The majority tumor detect surgical intervention require patient receive radiation therapy spine lesion symptomatic relief . However , complete pain control , duration pain control along high recurrence rate lesion soft tissue complication make radiation less ideal treatment . In addition , pre-operative radiation therapy significant negative prognosticator surgical outcome . To improve treatment option patient advanced cancer spinal lesion research team investigate new minimally invasive therapy , know photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) target metastatic spine lesion directly limited side effect . PDT involve use photo-activated chemotherapeutic agent , benzoporphyrin derivative ( verteporfin/Visudyne ) give intravenously stimulate non-thermal wavelength-specific light allow selective ablation tumor tissue . The light delivered spine small fiber optic cable ( out diameter 0.98mm , inner core 0.5mm mm ) use diode laser . Visudyne FDA Health Canada approve photosensizer use one million patient treatment age relate macular degeneration , lead cause blindness elderly . To investigate use PDT spinal metastasis investigator initially develop bioluminescent metastatic rodent model use human breast cancer metastasize spine . Using model determine PDT effective treating metastatic breast cancer lesion spine . The research team next utilized non-tumor bearing canine porcine model determine treatment could safely deliver spine conduct light dosimetry analysis . The safety PDT intra-operatively assess use somatosensory evoked potential post-treatment clinical examination magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The effect PDT spine analyze compare pre-operative post-operative MR image correlate turn histological analysis . None animal suffer weakness complication use PDT around spinal cord . During study investigator develop plan , delivery instrumentation methodology deliver PDT spinal tumor methodology combine therapy vertebroplasty , percutaneous method stabilize spine . In addition , separate set study , highgrade osteosarcomas canine treat determine effect PDT large bone tumor . The result study provided comparison pre post-treatment effect see MRI histological analysis . The volume effect see osteosarcoma 25cm ( cub ) comparable volume effect require complete treatment spinal lesion . By combine canine porcine study strong evidence PDT safe effective treatment metastatic tumor spine . PDT many advantage current therapy ; target , repeatable , minimally invasive limited local systemic side effect . Its use would enhance treatment option patient advanced stage cancer . The goal present study demonstrate PDT safely effectively give treat spinal metastasis patient advanced stage cancer . The study pilot study determine safe accurate treatment 30 patient spinal metastasis multiple lesion fail radiation surgical intervention . The effectiveness treatment determine clinical radiographic endpoint recurrence survival also determine . The investigator intend demonstrate PDT provide minimally invasive method low morbidity mortality spinal tumor ablate later stabilize vertebroplasty , optimize quality life provide effective treatment devastate manifestation advance stage cancer .</detailed_description>
