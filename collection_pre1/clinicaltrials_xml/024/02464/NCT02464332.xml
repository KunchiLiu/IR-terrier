	<brief_summary>Many type cancer primarily treat surgery patient survival directly relate extent tumor able remove . It often difficult surgeon distinguish tumor tissue normal tissue , failure surgically remove cancer-affected lymph node residual cancer surgical margin reduce patient 's chance survival . Moreover , damage adjacent normal tissue surgery result significant morbidity . The investigator hypothesize BLZ-100 improve surgical outcome allow surgeon visualize edge tumor small group cancer cell spread sit real-time operate . This safety study assess safety BLZ-100 patient soft tissue sarcoma undergo surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study BLZ-100 Adult Subjects With Sarcoma Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects provide voluntary write informed consent screen eligibility . Subjects meet inclusion none exclusion criterion eligible participate . This two part study : Part 1 - Dose Finding : Subjects require arrive phase 1 unit dose 2-3 day prior plan surgical excision . Two dose level BLZ-100 ( 3 mg 12 mg ) evaluate total 6 subject 2-3 day post-dose imaging interval ( also define Intermediate Imaging interval ) . Part 2 - Imaging Interval Assessment : The BLZ-100 dose evaluate Part 2 determine Protocol Steering Committee follow completion Part 1 . In Part 2 , 15 additional subject randomize one three image interval group ( 6 subject per group ) : Early Imaging ( within 1 day post BLZ-100 dose ) , Intermediate Imaging ( 2-3 day post BLZ-100 dose ) , Late Imaging ( 4-7 day post BLZ-100 dose ) . Subjects require arrive phase 1 unit dose 1 7 day prior plan surgical excision , depend image interval randomize . Following dosing , subject monitor safety .</detailed_description>
