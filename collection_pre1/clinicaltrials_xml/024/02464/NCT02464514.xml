	<detailed_description>Obesity continue prevalent health concern affect every race American population . Studies show obese child likely become obese adult . Also , recent study report significant year life lose due impact obese adult . Thus , insight pathogenesis childhood obesity preventative measure need combat inevitable increase worldwide incidence obesity associate co-morbidities . Ghrelin 28 amino acid acylated peptide endogenous ligand growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHS-R ) , hypothalamic G-protein-coupled receptor . Enteroendocrine cell ( X/A-like cell ) stomach major site ghrelin synthesis , although minor proportion ghrelin synthesis occur site hypothalamus , pituitary , duodenum , jejunum lung . Secreted response meal , ghrelin stimulates feed activation anabolic neuron hypothalamic arcuate nucleus co-express neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) agouti-related protein ( Agrp ) . Ghrelin relay information GI tract specific nuclei hypothalamus via gastric afferent vagal nerve . Studies rodents support premise ghrelin involve energy balance . In human , physiological level ghrelin influence energy homeostasis humans.The rise plasma ghrelin concentration fasting may play role meal initiation body weight regulation . Nearly forms obesity associate low ghrelin level . Paradoxically , researcher discover ghrelin level adult child PWS 3-5 time higher age- BMI-matched control . Hyperghrelinemia may thus play causal role hyperphagia obesity PWS . The hyperghrelinemia child PWS provide unique model explore hormonal metabolic effect orexigenic hormone normal pathologic condtions . An important question address propose research include macro-nutrient regulation ghrelin normal child child PWS . As ghrelin antagonist consider potential future anti-obesity agent , essential gain understanding developmental , nutritional hormonal regulation important orexigenic hormone child .</detailed_description>
