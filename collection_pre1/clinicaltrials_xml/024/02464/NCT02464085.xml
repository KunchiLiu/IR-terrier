	<detailed_description>The main goal program research advance understand severely damage brain change first 12-months post stroke . The prevalence severity stroke related arm disability increase prospect optimal recovery poor . Studies demonstrate stroke survivor severe disability lack early indicator ( &lt; 7-days &lt; 1-month post-stroke ) good prognosis , active movement shoulder wrist integrity corticospinal tract . This propagated clinical belief cohort unlikely functionally benefit rehabilitation effort . However , possible indicator potential recovery - either neuroanatomical clinical - may present individual severe stroke later , beyond early time-period . Indeed , increase evidence potential ongoing improvement motor performance response intensive intervention undertaken 6-months post-stroke . This therefore , implies degree untapped recovery potential . However , study longitudinally explore potential indicator recovery severe cohort , dynamic capacity severely damage remains unknown . Thus , need determine 'who recovers ' , 'who recover ' , 'why ' able promote optimal arm recovery people severe impairment stroke . We assess stroke survivor &lt; 4-weeks , 3-months , 6-months 12-months post stroke use range neuroimaging clinical outcome measure . The finding study build foundation personalize health care option people severe arm impairment post stroke .</detailed_description>
