	<detailed_description>Objective : To compare umbilical cord gas subject receive oxygen 10L/min via simple facemask subject receive room air present schedule cesarean section . The investigator hypothesize umbilical artery pH level significantly lower oxygenated group . Primary outcome : umbilical artery pH level oxygenate versus room air group Secondary outcome : Apgars , respiratory distress syndrome , necrotizing enterocolitis , interventricular hemorrhage , intubation , number NICU day neonatal mortality . Methods : Only term elective c-section approach study consent . Once enrolled subject randomize either receive 10L/min via simple facemask room air . Once regional anesthesia complete , facemask oxygen place . The time oxygen administration uterine incision least 10 min . At time delivery umbilical cord gas collect process within one hour delivery . Inclusion criterion : - 18 year old - Scheduled cesarean section - Singleton - Term gestation ; 37 0/7 week gestation great Exclusion criterion : - Maternal lung disease include asthma - Evidence hypoxemia prior enrollment - Intrauterine growth restriction - Chronic hypertension - Preeclampsia - Fetal anomaly - Breech position - Multiple Gestation Statistical analysis : Subjects randomize via block randomization . The estimated umbilical arterial pH schedule cesarean section room air group 7.31 . To identify 0.05 great difference control treatment group , power 0.8 , alpha 0.05 investigator would need 64 subject total . To account drop investigator intend enroll total 70 subject .</detailed_description>
