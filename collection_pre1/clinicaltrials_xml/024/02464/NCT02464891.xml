	<brief_title>Complement Inhibition aHUS Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inherited defect determine uncontrolled activation alternative complement pathway well documented atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome ( aHUS ) patient . Research recent year identify 120 different mutation , account around 40 % -60 % case , gene encode complement factor H ( CFH ) , membrane cofactor protein ( MCP ) , complement factor I ( CFI ) , C3 , complement factor B ( CFB ) , thrombomodulin ( THBD ) . A therapeutic approach could administration molecule pharmacologically target complement activation , primary common pathogenic mechanism genetic form aHUS . Eculizumab successfully use prophylaxis aHUS recurrence subject plasma dependent plasma resistant disease renal transplant recipient high risk recurrence due CFH , CFI , C3 complement gene mutation . However drug must administer chronically drug space discontinuance associate disease recurrence graft . The C5aR receptor antagonist CCX168 could present appeal alternative eculizumab post-transplant prophylaxis aHUS recurrence since orally administrable low cost good . In addition , CCX168 theoretically associate low risk infection eculizumab since former target C5b leave terminal complement pathway intact .</detailed_description>
