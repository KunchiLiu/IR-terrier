	<brief_title>New Oral Direct Anticoagulants Patients 80 Years Old Over : Population Pharmacokinetics Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several new oral direct anticoagulant recently market . A main indication take drug atrial fibrillation , everyday practice , patient atrial fibrillation old people . However , , limit , study provide data pharmacology new oral direct anticoagulant old person . Furthermore , limit data strongly suggest , old patient , mean concentration , overall exposition half-live drug increase , compare young people . This study try good define wether pharmacology 3 drug ( dabigatran , rivaroxaban apixaban ) actually significantly different old patient ( 80 ) extend . The investigator also try characterize main determinant ( age , weight , renal function , co-morbidities , etc ) variability observe individual response drug study . The method employ population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study . This , many people ( project 225 patient ) blood sample data pool use statistical method specific kind study . Each patient one five blood sample , take te time routine blood analysis , determine plasma concentration study drug . In addition , patient follow thrombotic haemorrhagic event 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
