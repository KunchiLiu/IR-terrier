	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether INO-4212 component INO-4201 INO-4202 administer intramuscularly ( IM ) intradermally ( ID ) follow electroporation ( EP ) well tolerate immunogenic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Study INO-4212 With Without INO-9012 , Administered IM ID Followed Electroporation Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study test safety , tolerability , immunogenicity DNA vaccine , INO-4212 component INO-4201 INO-4202 healthy volunteer . INO-4201 contains DNA sequence code past Ebola Zaire virus outbreak strain , INO-4202 contain DNA sequence code current Ebola virus outbreak strain . When give together , DNA vaccine call INO-4212 contains DNA sequence previous current outbreak strain . Another ingredient call INO-9012 contains DNA sequence interleukin-12 , give subset subject help boost body 's immune response give vaccine . Following administration vaccine , specialize medical device , CELLECTRA® , deliver brief electrical pulse process know electroporation ( EP ) , help move DNA cell efficiently . The study evaluate whether INO-4212 component may able generate protective immunity Ebola Zaire , evaluate relative ability IM versus ID administration elicit immune response evaluate whether vaccine administer INO-9012 generate great immune response . The Ebola vaccine study test approximately 240 healthy adult volunteer .</detailed_description>
