	<brief_summary>This Phase II studyis design investigate antitumor activity term objective response rate ( ORR ) tipifarnib 18 subject advanced Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma ( PTCL ) . The total number patient could extend 30 pending degree response observe interim analysis . Tipifarnib administer disease progression follow approximately every 12 week survival either death 12 month accrual last study subject , whichever occur first .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase II study investigate antitumor activity term ORR tipifarnib subject relapse refractory PTCL . Up 30 subject may enrol study . A two-stage study design use order minimize number study subject treat tipifarnib consider sufficiently efficacious grant development subject population . Tumor response assessment conduct accord IWC and/or mSWAT criterion . Tumor assessment perform approximately every 8 week cycle 2-6 least approximately every 12 week thereafter ( Cycles 9 , 12 , 15 , etc . ) , continue disease progression . Subjects experience complete response may consider transplantation . Upon disease progression , subject follow approximately every 12 week survival use subsequent therapy either death 12 month accrual last study subject , whichever occur first . All subject followed-up safety treatment approximately 30 day ( 30 +/- 7 day ) treatment discontinuation immediately initiation another anti-cancer therapy , whichever occur first . Additional follow may implement subject recovers emergent treatment related toxicity adverse event consider irreversible investigator .</detailed_description>
