	<brief_summary>Diarrhea common problem pediatric population . Children cancer especially increase risk gastrointestinal infection-related morbidity mortality due ongoing immunosuppression . However , epidemiology diarrheal illness immunocompromised child poorly understood . In past , many case gastroenteritis go undiagnosed , largely due lack sensitive diagnostic test presumption large proportion case due treatment , rather infection . The availability new diagnostic test detect many gastrointestinal pathogen simultaneously offer first opportunity gain comprehensive picture cause infectious diarrhea child cancer . Researchers St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital want learn epidemiology diarrheal diseases pediatric oncology patient utilize broadly multiplexed , automate PCR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study plan enroll participant two group : - GROUP 1 : Participants hematologic malignancy solid tumor . - Participants agree take part research study stool sample collect diagnosis ( baseline sample ) month thereafter 12 month time enrollment . Stool sample screen different type microbe may present . For participant develop diarrhea 12 month , three additional stool sample collect Day 0 , Day 7 Day 14 ; two blood sample mid-turbinate nasal swab collect well Day 0 Day 7 first observed diarrheal episode screen additional microbe may cause diarrhea . - GROUP 2 : Participants hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) patient . - Participants agree take part research study stool sample collect within one week prior conditional chemotherapy ( baseline sample ) weekly thereafter total 16 week ( pre- early post-engraftment period ) , follow monthly 8 month . Stool sample screen different type microbe may present . For participant develop diarrhea , three additional stool sample collect Day 0 , Day 7 Day 14 ; two blood sample mid-turbinate nasal swab collect well Day 0 Day 7 first observed diarrheal episode screen additional microbe may cause diarrhea . For GROUP 2 participant , two diarrheal episode study per patient : first diarrheal episode pre-engraftment period , first diarrheal episode post-engraftment period . Participants change cancer treatment plan enrol study : Group 1 participant experience change cancer treatment plan necessitate allogeneic stem cell transplant take study group 1 offer opportunity consent group 2 Participants choose enroll group 2 complete 12-month study requirement define protocol group 2 participant . General health information participant medical record health-related information symptom also obtain time collection sample . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To assess prevalence microbial pathogen stool pediatric oncology patient diarrheal illness . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To describe clinical course , symptomatology , morbidity mortality associate diarrheal disease pediatric oncology patient St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital . - Evaluate performance multiplex polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay diagnosis infectious diarrhea comparison standard care method .</detailed_description>
