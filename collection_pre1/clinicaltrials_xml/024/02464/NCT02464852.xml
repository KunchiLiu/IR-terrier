	<brief_title>Assessment Effects Sheffield Support Snood MND Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor Neurone Disease ( MND ) neurodegenerative disorder lead progressive weakness limb , bulbar respiratory muscle . The common form disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) . Severe weakness neck extensor muscle common patient ALS . Those patient advise wear cervical collar , improve neck posture social interaction . However main limit commercially available collar design immobilize neck , make uncomfortable strenuous wear long time . The aim study evaluate effect MND patient new collar specifically design people affect neck weakness : Sheffield Support Snood . The assessment perform use inertial sensor since allow measurement perform real life setting ( clinics/home ) reduce discomfort patient . Subjects ask perform series active head movement ( flexion , extension , axial rotation , lateral bending ) without collar range movement measure two case use assess support offer collar . Since MND patient difficulty perform active head movement due severe weakness extensor muscle , without involvement neck flexor , study also investigate activation muscle subject perform active head movement . A wireless surface electromyographic system ( sEMG ) use purpose . Patients able perform series activity daily living ( ADL , ie : drinking , eat , wash hand ) ask perform task without collar . The support perceive subject perform ADL evaluate questionnaire specifically develop study .</detailed_description>
