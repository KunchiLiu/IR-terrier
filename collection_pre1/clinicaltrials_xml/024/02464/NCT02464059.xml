	<brief_summary>This proposal evaluate potential mechanism increase risk lung function impairment , cathelicidin level , well determine vitamin D replacement alter pathway . This study improve understand factor lead chronic lung disease . If effective , application would also provide justification study vitamin D therapy improve lung health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cathelicidin Vitamin D : Impact Populations At-Risk With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Understanding mechanism lead decrement lung function , physiologic hallmark obstructive lung disease include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , necessary inform intervention improve lung health . The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin , primary regulator vitamin D , implicate development progression chronic lung disease . In study , investigator evaluate effect oral vitamin D supplementation lung cathelicidin level human . Cathelicidin bactericidal inflammatory activity lung regulate vitamin D level . The investigator hypothesize oral vitamin D supplementation raise cathelicidin level pulmonary compartment , thereby restore lung cathelicidin deficiency . To test hypothesis , investigator recruit two ongoing cohort study : 1 ) At Johns Hopkins , Subpopulations Intermediate Outcome Measures COPD Study study individual establish COPD 2 ) University North Carolina Chapel Hill pulmonary general medicine clinic recruit smoker normal lung function . The investigator measure blood lung lavage cathelicidin level 40 vitamin D insufficient individual ( 20 cohort ) eight week oral vitamin D supplementation determine effect vitamin D supplementation cathelicidin level .</detailed_description>
