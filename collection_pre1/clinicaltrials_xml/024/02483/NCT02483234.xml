	<brief_summary>Purpose rationale : To define role IL-17 mediator structural bone lesion psoriasis patient patient PsA . Primary Objective improvement PsAMRIS synovitis score baseline vs. week 24 . Drug test Secukinumab 300 mg administer weekly 4 week , 4 weekly s.c. duration total 24 week . Indication study Psoriasis ( Pso ) psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients eligible inclusion study fulfill follow criterion : Subjects take DMARDs ( e.g . MTX ) allow continue medication dose stable least 4 week baseline remain stable dose Week 24 . Subjects previously treat TNFα inhibitor ( investigational approve ) allow entry study appropriate washout period prior randomization PsA patient : Diagnosis PsA classify CASPAR criterion symptoms least 6 month moderate severe PsA must Baseline ≥3 tender joint 78 ≥3 swell 76 ( dactylitis digit count one joint ) Rheumatoid factor antiCCP antibody negative screening Subjects PsA take NSAIDs least 4 week prior randomization inadequate control symptoms least one dose stop due intolerance NSAIDs Subjects take corticosteroid must stable dose ≤10 mg/day prednisone equivalent least 2 week baseline remain stable dose Week 24 Psoriasis patient : moderateto severe psoriasis ( PASI &gt; 6 ) diagnosis PsA inflammatory and/or structural lesion and/or erosion MRI/HRqCT scan • Chest Xray chest MRI evidence ongoing infectious malignant process , obtain within 3 month prior screen evaluate qualified physician Subjects take high potency opioid analgesic ( e.g . methadone , hydromorphone , morphine ) Previous exposure secukinumab biologic drug directly target IL17 IL17 receptor Ongoing use prohibit psoriasis treatment / medication ( e.g. , topical corticosteroid , UV therapy ) baseline . The following wash period need observe : Oral topical retinoids 4 week Photochemotherapy ( e.g . PUVA ) 4 week Phototherapy ( UVA UVB ) 2 week Topical skin treatment ( except face , scalp genital area screening , corticosteroid mild moderate potency ) 2 week Subjects ever receive biologic immunomodulating agent except target TNFα IL23p40 , investigational approve Previous treatment celldepleting therapy include limited antiCD20 , investigational agent ( e.g. , CAMPATH , antiCD4 , antiCD5 , antiCD3 , antiCD19 ) Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unwilling use effective contraception study minimum 20 week stop treatment . Effective contraception define either : Barrier method : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicide ( available ) . Spermicides alone barrier method contraception use alone The following method consider effective barrier method also acceptable : Total abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle subject [ Periodic abstinence ( e.g . calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception ] Female sterilization : surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment Use establish oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception , intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) . In case use oral contraception woman stabile pill minimum 12 week take study treatment . Active ongoing inflammatory disease PsA might confound evaluation benefit secukinumab therapy Underlying metabolic , hematologic , renal , hepatic , pulmonary , neurologic , endocrine , cardiac , infectious gastrointestinal condition opinion investigator immunocompromises subject and/or place subject unacceptable risk participation immunomodulatory therapy History clinically significant liver disease liver injury indicate abnormal liver function test SGOT ( AST ) , SGPT ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase , serum bilirubin . The investigator guide follow criterion : Any single parameter may exceed 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . A single parameter elevate include 2 x ULN rechecked soon possible , case , least prior enrollment/randomization , rule lab error If total bilirubin concentration increase 2 x ULN , total bilirubin differentiate direct indirect react bilirubin . In case , serum bilirubin exceed value 1.6 mg/dL ( 27 µmol/L ) Screening total WBC count &lt; 3,000/µL , platelet &lt; 100,000/µL neutrophil &lt; 1,500/µL hemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dL ( 85g/L ) Active systemic infection last two week ( exception : common cold ) prior randomization History ongoing , chronic recurrent infectious disease evidence tuberculosis infection define either positive PPD skin test ( size induration measure 4872 hour , positive result define induration ≥ 5mm accord local practice/guidelines ) positive QuantiFERON TBGold test indicate assessment schedule Table 1 : Assessment Schedule ( Screening week 24 ) . Subjects positive test may participate study work ( accord local practice/guidelines ) establish conclusively subject evidence active tuberculosis . If presence latent tuberculosis establish treatment accord local country guideline must initiate . Known infection HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C screen randomization History lymphoproliferative disease know malignancy history malignancy organ system within past 5 year ( except basal cell carcinoma actinic keratoses treat evidence recurrence past 3 month , carcinoma situ cervix noninvasive malignant colon polyp remove ) History evidence ongoing alcohol drug abuse , within last six month randomization Plans administration live vaccine study period within 6 week precede randomization .</criteria>
