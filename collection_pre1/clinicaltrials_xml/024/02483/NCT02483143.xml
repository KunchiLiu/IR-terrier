	<brief_summary>Study objective : The purpose study compare role prophylactic protocol N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) plus normal saline , sodium bicarbonate ( NaHCO3 ) plus normal saline intravenous normal saline ( NS ) alone prevention contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) compute tomography pulmonary angiography ( CTPA ) emergency patient suspect pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . Materials method : This study plan randomize , double blind , placebo control clinical research . Patients present emergency department within 1-year period , undergo CTPA suspicion PE one risk factor development CIN include study . The NAC group receive 1 ml/3 mgr NAC+NS solution 1 h CTPA 1 ml/kg per hour minimum 6 h CTPA . The NaHCO3 group receive 132 mEq NaHCO3+NS solution 1 h CTPA 1 ml/kg per hour minimum 6h CTPA . The normal saline ( NS ) group receive 3 ml/kg NS 1 h CTPA 1 ml/kg per hour NS minimum 6 h CTPA . CIN evaluate primary outcome , moderate renal injury ( defined 100 % increase serum creatinine level ) , severe renal insufficiency require hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis ) in-hospital mortality secondary outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NAC , NaHCO3 NS Prophylaxis CTPA ED Suspicion PE : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design Setting This randomize , double blind , placebo control study perform emergency department tertiary care university hospital Turkey receive &gt; 100,000 patient presentation annually . Approval grant Karadeniz Technical University institutional ethical committee . Written informed consent receive patient enrol . The data collect period commence 1 February 2014 , study period last 1 year 1 February 2015 . Selection Participants Patients undergo contrast enhance thoracic tomography due suspect PE , age 18 , measureable basal creatinine level pre-tomography measurable serum creatinine level 48-72 h post-tomography one risk factor CIN cite enrol . The risk factor pre-existing renal dysfunction ( Cre 1.4 mg/dl high calculate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) , diabetes mellitus , hypertension receive treatment , hypotension ( SBP &lt; 90 mmHg ) , coronary artery disease , history nephrotoxic drug use ( NSAID , cisplatin , aminoglycoside , amphotericin B ) , liver disease , congestive heart failure ( active history thereof ) , age 65 , anemia ( Htc &lt; 30 % ) . Patients refuse participate provide inform consent , end stage renal patient already peritoneal dialysis hemodialysis , pregnant woman , subject know allergy N-acetylcysteine Na-bicarbonate , patient require NAC therapy Na-bicarbonate therapy exist additional disease , patient expose contrast material reason previous 2 day exclude . In addition , study protocol consider physician responsible treatment emergency department liable delay medical care adverse effect , drug protocol think contraindicate , patient also exclude . Interventions Computer-based block randomization employ randomize subject . Three group , A , B C establish , represent drug branch treatment code . The diagnostic approach algorithm apply patient suspected PE planning treatment PE base 2014 ESC Guidelines diagnosis management acute pulmonary embolism . In NAC group ; 3 gr NAC make 1000 ml NS ; 1 ml/3 mgr NAC solution obtain 3 ml/kg NAC+NS solution administer 1 h CTPA 1 ml/kg per hour NAC+NS solution administer minimum 6 h CTPA . In NaHCO3 group ; 132 mEq NaHCO3 make 1000 ml NS ; 3 ml/kg NaHCO3+NS solution administer 1 h CTPA 1 ml/kg per hour NaHCO3+NS solution administer minimum 6 h CTPA . In NS group : 3 ml/kg NS administer 1 h CTPA 1 ml/kg per hour administer minimum 6 h CTPA . Clinical follow-up Post-CTPA prophylactic infusion maintain least 6 h. Patients unable complete period remove study include analysis . Patients regularly observe physician responsible patient monitoring author blind prophylactic alternative receive throughout study . Creatinine measurement require determine CIN development 48 72 h perform department patient hospitalize , discharge patient invited return emergency department venous blood specimen collect use phlebotomy . Outcome Measures CIN development ( increase â‰¥25 % 0.5 mg/dl creatinine level 48-72 h contrast exposure compare basal level ) evaluate primary outcome study . A secondary outcome assess moderate renal injury develop hospitalization ( defined 100 % increase serum creatinine level , severe renal failure require hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis ) in-hospital mortality . Patients monitor throughout hospitalization either discharge mortality .</detailed_description>
