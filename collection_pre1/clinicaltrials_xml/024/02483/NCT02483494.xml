	<brief_summary>Aim . To develop examine effectiveness APN-led telehealth rehabilitative programme transitional nursing therapeutic readmission rate health relate outcome amongst patient Acute Myocardial Infarction ( AMI ) post discharge . Design . Randomized control trial repeat measure . Methodology . A consecutive sample 172 patient AMI recruit tertiary hospital Singapore . Participants randomise two group . The experimental group ( ALTRA ) receive APN-led telehealth rehabilitative programme upon discharge addition standard care . The control group receive standard follow-up care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ischaemic heart disease third lead cause death illness hospitalisation Singapore . Epidemiological data show incidence acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) stand around 7000 plus Singapore . In United States , nearly 20 % patient AMI readmitted within 30 day discharge cause healthcare system huge financial burden . These readmission show associated low patient satisfaction less inefficient healthcare . Cardiac rehabilitation proven effective strategy improve quality life reduce readmission . However , structure programme comprise clinical review , education exercise , poor uptake rate vary reason . It important new strategy explore developed cater change need patient population . One utilize telemedicine combination Advanced Practice Nurse deliver care remotely . This substudy IMMACULATE STUDY ( NCT02468349 ) detail find .</detailed_description>
