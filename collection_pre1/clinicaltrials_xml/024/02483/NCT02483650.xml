	<brief_summary>The purpose Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Registry ( HBOTR ) provide real world patient outcome side effect information electronic health record submit specialty specific hyperbaric registry part `` Stage 2 Meaningful Use , '' include data provide meet PQRS requirement via registry 's QCDR mission . Goals include understand value HBOT among patient treat variety condition relation frequency severity HBOT side effect . While randomize , control trial establish efficacy treatment like HBOT , routinely exclude patient co-morbid condition common patient see usual clinical practice , result RCTs usually non-generalizable . Real world data use well understand effectiveness HBOT among typical patient , well risk associate treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Registry ( HBOTR ) Wounds provide comparative effectiveness data patient understand whether clinical practice guideline follow use HBOT . Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy ( HBOT ) use oxygen great one atmosphere ( sea level ) pressure administer place entire patient pressurize vessel patient breathe 100 % oxygen . The minimum treatment pressure evidence support use among condition approve Undersea Hyperbaric Medical society 2.0 atmosphere absolute ( 2 ATA ) inspire partial pressure oxygen approximately 1,520 mmHg . Hyperbaric treatment provide less 100 % inspired oxygen treatment pressure and/or provide inspire partial pressure oxygen le 760 mmHg hyperbaric therapy . Topically applied oxygen hyperbaric oxygen therapy . Oxygen drug well-defined dose response curve well acute chronic drug effect . HBOT also side effect include oxygen toxicity many organ system . The physiological effect hyperbaric oxygen therapy well study . Effectiveness real world patient best current option understand role HBOT wound heal . Hospital base outpatient wound center participate US Wound Registry agree provide data part quality initiatives meet Stage 2 Meaningful use criterion . The HBOTR subset USWR ( Chronic Disease Registry ) data . All patient data participate hyperbaric center transmit USWR data use designated benchmarking , satisfy requirement PQRS advance practitioner , data need UHMS respond governmental agency . Data use effectiveness research HIPAA de-identified .</detailed_description>
