	<brief_title>The Effects Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Transcranial Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Chronic Lower Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As result sustain operation Afghanistan Iraq , increase number U.S. military personnel Veterans need effective pain management treatment . Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) common pain condition among return Veterans associate high level opioid analgesic prescribing VA clinic . Although opioids effective acute pain , effective long-term treatment strategy . Furthermore , opioids associate significantly increase risk misuse , addiction , diversion , overdose death . Consequently , critical need development alternative , effective treatment CLBP implement VA-based healthcare setting . The propose study answer critical question regard ability Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) augment effect cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) pain , elucidate possible mechanism underlie improved outcome . tDCS inexpensive highly portable , make scalable tool add current CBT intervention within VA healthcare system . This study particular advantage build directly positive preliminary finding among civilian lead multi-disciplinary team expert successfully collaborate past uniquely qualified implement type investigation . The primary objective propose Stage II study evaluate effect CBT combination tDCS ( 1 ) improve pain functionality , ( 2 ) reduce severity opioid use disorder , ( 3 ) reduce impairment associate mental health area ( e.g. , depression , anxiety , PTSD , sleep ) . The investigator also determine effect treatment neural activity cognitive limbic brain region involve pain regulation use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , examine relationship opioid use severity . Secondary objective evaluate acute lab-based pain marker neural correlate improvement chronic pain use quantitative sensory test . In order accomplish investigator : use manualized , evidence-based CBT intervention already widely-disseminated within VA system ; employ randomize , between-groups , double-blind experimental design ; examine standardize , repeat , dependent measure change : ( ) clinical outcome pain , opioid substance use disorder ( e.g. , alcohol , illicit drug , prescription drug ) , depression , anxiety , sleep PTSD symptomatology ; ( b ) process variable participant satisfaction , quality life treatment retention . The result study provide important information regard two non-pharmacologic , evidence-based intervention ( CBT tDCS ) , help inform policy program well serve need U.S. military personnel , Veterans , family . The finding study may help reduce public health cost morbidity/mortality associate chronic pain co-morbid prescription opiate use disorder among nation 's Veterans .</detailed_description>
