	<brief_summary>Corneal abrasion associate significant discomfort 24-48 hr heal phase . Current practice guideline discourage use topical anesthetic treat patient due concern medication may prevent proper corneal epithelial healing . These concern base primarily decade old animal base research . However , recent evidence suggest topical anaesthetic safe effective way manage patient pain short term . This study investigate effect topical 0.5 % tetracaine corneal heal pain management patient corneal abrasion first 48 hour . This prospective , double blind , randomize , control study 260 adult uncomplicated acute corneal injury present tertiary acute care setting Kingston . Patients randomly assign receive either 0.5 % tetracaine saline addition usual care outpatient . They follow ophthalmology emergency eye clinic ass heal 36-48hrs . acute care visit . The primary outcome assessment pain measure every 4 hour 48 hr . use 10mm Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . Secondary outcome include assessment corneal healing , use adjunct pain medication , time lose work/usual activity , quality sleep , ability read SF12 quality life questionnaire . This study well inform safety effectiveness short-term tetracaine usage patient simple corneal abrasion optimal treatment patient future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Tetracaine Pain Management Corneal Healing Patients With Acute Corneal Abrasion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corneal abrasion commonly encounter eye injury present acute care setting account 10 % new ophthalmological presentation eye accident department , primary care office , emergency department . Patients complain severe eye pain , foreign body sensation , pain blinking , photophobia . Corneal abrasion defect epithelial layer occur secondary mechanical ocular surface trauma . Common cause corneal abrasion include fingernail injury , tree branch , projectile piece metal , wood , glass injure become embed cornea . . Though associated significant discomfort , prognosis simple corneal abrasion usually excellent , full recovery within 24-48 hour . Untreated abrasion , particularly associate retain foreign body , lead complication corneal ulcer , prolong pain , visual acuity loss . Currently , standard approach treat corneal abrasion include removal foreign body present , oral analgesic pain control , topical antibiotic . Traditional guideline ophthalmologist advocate use topical anesthetic due concern corneal epithelial heal potential patient miss important clinical clue indicate rare development secondary corneal infection , well potential long term misuse lead severe corneal ulceration perforation . Previous study , primarily use animal model , find delay corneal epithelial heal topical anaesthetic , particularly repeat prolonged usage . Several case study describe impaired corneal epithelial heal ulceration prolong use abuse topical anesthetic drop ( 0.05 % proparacaine HCl ) . There report topical anesthetic ( TA ) induce corneal damage include punctate epitheliopathy , corneal lysis , perforation , persistent epithelial defect , ocular inflammation . It think local anesthetic inhibit mitosis cellular migration , prevent proper re-epithelialization cornea . However , recent year number randomize clinical trial case study human subject show appropriate application restrict short term usage , topical anesthetic delay wound heal increase risk corneal ulceration . A recent prospective , randomize , double-blind trial look effect topical anesthetic epithelial heal pain management patient uncomplicated corneal abrasion . The study include 116 patient present emergency department give either 1 % tetracaine HCl control artificial tear . The study find change corneal heal rate persistent symptom little benefit pain relief measure 48 hr . A previous prospective randomize study compare 0.05 % proparacaine placebo show significant decrease report pain topical anesthetic use compare control change corneal healing . Another study evaluate effect 1 % tetracaine pain management photorefractive keratectomy also report significant pain reduction topical anesthetic use delay epithelial healing . Controversy continue exist utility topical anesthetic manage pain safety affect corneal healing . Contemporary study short term topical anesthetic use , note , show adverse effect heal . Differential effect pain management found . Yet investigator believe Waldman study measure pain delayed time abrasion would expect healed . Clinicians Queen 's Department Emergency Medicine generally prescribe topical anesthetic corneal abrasion believe evidence demonstrate efficacy safety would change practice pattern benefit patient injury centre . The investigator also hope study good address problem inadequate participant enrollment retention previous study encounter . 1.3 - Research Question In adult emergency department patient acute corneal abrasion , application 0.5 % tetracaine effective short-term management pain associate adverse effect heal ? 1.4 - Hypothesis Based review exist literature effect topical anesthetic , investigator hypothesize short-term controlled usage tetracaine effective way manage patient pain affect corneal healing .</detailed_description>
