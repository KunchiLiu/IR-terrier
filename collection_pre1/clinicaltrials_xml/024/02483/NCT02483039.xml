	<brief_title>Nephrologist Follow-up Versus Usual Care After Acute Kidney Injury Hospitalization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Survivors acute kidney injury ( AKI ) increase risk chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) death , inconsistent follow-up care . Our team develop test model deliver structure follow-up kidney care ( AKI Follow-up Clinic ) feasible sustainable , standardized assessment base upon clinical practice guideline transferable set . This study randomize patient Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) stage 2-3 AKI AKI Follow-up Clinic usual care ( control group ) . The usual care group letter outline AKI diagnosis mail family physician ; usual care group may still refer nephrologist healthcare provider desire , participant access AKI Follow-up Clinic pathway . The primary outcome development major adverse kidney event ( MAKE ) , composite death , chronic dialysis , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) decline . Outcomes ascertain one year follow-up , AKI Follow-up Clinic patient transition back family doctor general nephrologist base upon pre-specified graduation criterion . Participants also follow use local hospital electronic resource Institute Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) administrative database order ass long-term impact early nephrologist follow-up AKI outcome .</detailed_description>
