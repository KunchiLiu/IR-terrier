	<brief_summary>Blood transfusion require patient undergoing craniosynostosis repair due significant amount blood loss . Irradiated non-irradiated transfusion many risk involve include elevated potassium level graft versus host disease ( TA-GVHD ) . Irradiated blood able destroy leukocytes responsible TA-GVHD , adversely cause elevated extracellular potassium due hemolysis RBC 's . When blood transfuse , may introduce much extracellular potassium ( &gt; 6.5 meq/L ) patient cause interference heart 's conduction system significantly increase risk hemodynamic change , cardiac arrhythmia , cardiac arrest . Hyperkalemia rapid transfusion occurs much frequently TA-GVHD ; however , complication under-reported . The study aim evaluate risk irradiate versus non-irradiated blood patient age 6 month undergoing craniosynostosis repair . This do comparing level extracellular potassium pre-transfusion , transfusion , immediately transfusion , 30 minute completion transfusion . The investigator hypothesize patient receive irradiated blood increase extracellular potassium level compare receive non-irradiated blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients age 2 6 month age undergo sagittal synostosis repair split two group participate prospective pilot study . The purpose study examine extracellular potassium level patient receive irradiate blood versus non-irradiated blood . Enrollment occur 24 month period 20 patient enrol . The patient names , medical record number identifier keep strictly confidential . Patients receive irradiated non-irradiated blood base age . Patients 4 month age receive irradiate blood product , per hospital protocol , patient 4 month age receive non-irradiated blood product . Patients receive standard surgical practice craniosynostosis repair receive blood transfusion discretion anesthesiologist surgeon . All blood transfuse analyzed prior transfusion . The patient 's extracellular potassium level record pre-transfusion , 30 minute interval transfusion , post-transfusion . The collect data compare test correlation extracellular potassium level , type blood transfuse , amount calcium administer . There minimal risk harm associate study . All surgical procedure run typical risk infection , bleed complication could occur operation . The blood transfusion may also increase patient 's risk graft versus host disease , hyperkalemia , cardiac anomaly . These case document respond accord anesthesiologist surgeon 's preference . Materials information necessary carry experiment include : patient age , sex , weight , type blood transfuse ( ABO non-irradiated/irradiated ) , vital sign , operate time , amount blood lose , adverse event , length stay . Patients decline participation study change anesthetic post-operative care .</detailed_description>
