	<brief_summary>Deficits ankle control stroke lead foot drop , result inefficient , aberrant gait elevate fall risk . Using novel ankle robot newly invent adaptive control system , study test whether robotic assist treadmill train improve gait balance function chronic stroke survivor foot drop impairment . It hypothesize , compare treadmill train alone , integrate adaptive ankle robotics treadmill train reduce drop foot independent overground walking , result great mobility , improved postural control reduce fall risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal investigate novel ankle robot ( anklebot ) adaptive control approach integrate treadmill train reduce foot drop improve mobility function chronic hemiparetic stroke survivor . Currently , stroke survivor foot drop train live cane assistive device , often ankle foot orthotics ( AFOs ) safety . Neither mediate task-practice neuromotor recovery . The investigator develop adaptive anklebot controller detect gait cycle sub-events precise timing grade robotics assist enable deficit severity adjust ankle motor learn context walking . The investigator 's pilot finding show 6 week treadmill train anklebot ( TMR ) time assist swing phase dorsiflexion , effective treadmill alone ( TM ) improve free-walking swing dorsiflexion foot strike , floor-walking speed , benefit retain 6 week post-training . Notably , swing-phase TMR training improve paretic leg push-off , reduce center-of-pressure sway stand balance , indicate potential benefit element gait balance , beyond robotically target toward foot drop . This randomized study investigate hypothesis 6 week TMR effective durably improve gait biomechanics , static dynamic balance , mobility function chronic stroke survivor dorsiflexion deficit , compare TM alone . Aims determine compare effectiveness 6 week TMR vs. TM alone : 1 . Independent gait function indexed gait velocity , swing-phase DF , terminal stance push . 2 . Balance function indexed measure postural sway ( CoP ) , asymmetric load quiet standing , peak paretic A-P force non-paretic gait initiation , standardized scale balance fall risk . 3 . Long-term mobility outcome , assess repeat measure key gait balance outcomes 6 week 3 month formal training cessation .</detailed_description>
