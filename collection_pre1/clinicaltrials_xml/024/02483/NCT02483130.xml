	<brief_summary>A double-blind , placebo control , crossover study determine whether single dose N-acetylcysteine ( nutritional supplement ) reduce brain glutamate level patient psychotic disorder . Secondary outcome determine pattern alteration brain perfusion activity follow single dose N-acetylcysteine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect N-acetylcysteine Brain Glutamate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This physiological , proof-of-concept study design investigate whether single administration N-acetylcysteine reduce brain glutamate level people psychotic disorder . Previous research suggest poor response antipsychotic may link increased level glutamate brain ( Egerton et al. , 2012Í¾ Demjaha , Egerton et al. , 2013 ) . Reducing brain glutamate level may therefore therapeutic . This study test whether possible reduce brain glutamate level psychotic disorder . This small pilot study determine whether single administration NAC reduce brain glutamate level psychosis . At time , also examine effect NAC brain rest perfusion activity , gain information NAC may act . This study recruit participant previous diagnosis psychotic disorder . There three study visit , 1-2 week apart . The first visit involve physical health check , blood sample interview assess current symptom confirm medical history . On second third visit participant MRI scan , last one hour , take capsule contain either 2400mg NAC placebo .</detailed_description>
