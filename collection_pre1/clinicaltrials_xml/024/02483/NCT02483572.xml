	<brief_summary>Children intellectual disability often display severe destructive behavior ( e.g. , aggression , self-injury ) pose risk others represent barrier community integration . Destructive behavior often treat behavioral intervention derive functional analysis , use identify antecedent consequence occasion reinforce destructive behavior . One treatment call functional communication training ( FCT ) , involve extinction destructive behavior reinforcement alternative communication response consequence previously reinforce destructive behavior . Results epidemiological study meta-analyses indicate treatment base functional analysis , like FCT , typically reduce destructive behavior 90 % effective treatment . However , many study use within-subject experimental design demonstrate control treatment effect . Replication effect FCT typically show subject-by-subject basis relatively small number patient ( e.g. , one four patient ) . No study demonstrate effectiveness FCT treatment destructive behavior across large group child . The goal study compare FCT ( use clinically majority investigator ' patient consider best practice treat destructive behavior occur social reason [ e.g. , access attention , preferred toy , escape unpleasant activity ] ) waitlist control group across large number child destructive behavior evaluate generality FCT effectiveness . The investigator evaluate rate destructive behavior patient pretest baseline follow FCT ( approximately four month later ) and/or waitlist control duration ( , approximately four month later ) . All child assign waitlist-control condition offer FCT service investigator ' clinic end four-month waitlist period . These child test follow four month FCT ( i.e. , posttest ) . Therefore , child assign FCT condition test twice ( one pretest one posttest ) , child assign waitlist-control condition test thrice ( one pretest , second pretest follow four-month waitlist period , one posttest ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Severe Destructive Behavior : FCT Versus Wait-List Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose current investigation evaluate generality FCT treatment severe destructive behavior . Again , effectiveness FCT treat destructive behavior demonstrate repeatedly investigator ' clinic clinic . The investigator specifically interested examine percentage population might benefit FCT , well identify subject characteristic child FCT effective . Children intellectual disability often display severe destructive behavior ( e.g. , aggression , self-injury ) pose significant risk self others represent overwhelm barrier community integration . These destructive behavior often treat behavioral intervention derive functional analysis , use identify environmental antecedent consequence occasion reinforce destructive behavior . One treatment call functional communication training ( FCT ) , involve extinction destructive behavior reinforcement alternative communication response consequence previously reinforce destructive behavior . Results epidemiological study meta-analyses indicate treatment base functional analysis , like FCT , typically reduce destructive behavior 90 % much effective treatment . Despite impressive finding , randomize , control trial evaluate effectiveness FCT . The goal study determine robustness FCT reduce severe destructive behavior compare waitlist control group .</detailed_description>
