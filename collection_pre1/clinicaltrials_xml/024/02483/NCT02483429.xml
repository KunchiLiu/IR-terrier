	<detailed_description>AVERT multicenter , Phase II clinical trial compare novel diagnostic strategy ( VRT ) standard ED diagnostic care three performance site . The Specific Aims assess diagnostic accuracy , diagnostic workup cost , estimate short-term impact correct diagnosis anticipation large , definitive Phase III trial . Adult ED patient chief symptom vertigo , dizziness , unsteadiness , new previous 7 day , undergo on-site vestibular function test train research personnel use portable , quantitative VOG recording device . Research personnel also record focus symptom history bedside hear test . Eligible patient least one pathologic vestibular eye movement find randomize VRT standard ED care . The VRT arm relies automate algorithm interpret VOG result , thereby determine patient-specific clinical care pathway . For safety , VRT-arm study subject undergo stroke protocol MRI release . All subject arm undergo confirmatory test one week , include vestibular specialist exam 3-Tesla research MRI combine stroke internal auditory canal protocol . All patient arm also undergo 30-day phone follow-up medical record review confirm diagnosis . Clinical finding , ED diagnose , diagnostic resource utilization , treatment apply , clinical event follow-up record . A multidisciplinary , mask , expert panel adjudicate final diagnosis .</detailed_description>
