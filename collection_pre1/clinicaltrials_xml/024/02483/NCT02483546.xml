	<brief_summary>High fidelity Simulation spread anesthesiology discipline internal medicine , pediatrics , emergency medicine . Over past decade , use simulation medical education increase exponentially . The term `` simulation '' span wide variety format , low-tech actor portray standardized patient high-fidelity mannequin-based human patient simulation ( HPS ) . HPS able simulate realistic patient encounter give real-time , physiologically accurate feedback . Studies thus far show use simulation training medical student resident helpful strengthen student ' knowledge evaluate performance . Students appreciate simulation-based education `` opportunity learn new skill safe environment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , control trial simulation- base educational intervention design increase medicine student 's clinical skill cardiac arrest procedure .The investigator include 181 fifth-year medical student rotate emergency department Fattouma Bourguiba University hospital Monastir ( Tunisia ) period January 2013 January 2014.Students randomize two group use random number generator intervention group ( simulatortrained , n = 99 ) control group ( traditionally teach , n =82 ) . The investigator conduct prospective , randomize , non-blinded study determine whether simulation base training superior traditional teaching assessment management simulate patient present myocardial infarction ( MI ) complicate ventricular fibrillation .</detailed_description>
