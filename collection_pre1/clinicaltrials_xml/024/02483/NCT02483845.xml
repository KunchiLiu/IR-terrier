	<brief_summary>Muscle biopsy patient Inclusion Body Myositis ( IBM ) demonstrate T-cell predominant inflammatory infiltrate , therefore , new agent target T -cell mediate cell death may novel treatment IBM . Such agent capable prevent T-cell movement vasculature , natalizumab , may beneficial IBM patient . Six patient recruited participate phase I trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natalizumab Inclusion Body Myositis ( IBM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I open label , non-placebo control trial evaluate safety efficacy natalizumab patient IBM . Pre post treatment muscle biopsy include measurement degree inflammation well type inflammatory cell measure . The investigator also assess quality life , inclusion body myositis functional rating score ( IBM-FRS ) , patient physician global impression change . Manual muscle test quantitative dynamometry also evaluate see patient 's strength improve . Patients eligible participate sign consent form muscle biopsy perform baseline end study . Physical neurological exam , well IBM-FRS , safety lab conduct collect monthly visit . Patients start natalizumab therapy 300mg intravenously every 4 week 24 week . All study relate procedure conduct Phoenix Neurological Associates , well infusion muscle biopsy</detailed_description>
