	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate safety diagnostic performance 68Ga label PET tracer [ 68Ga ] RM2 detection localization primary prostate cancer confirm histopathology prostate standard truth . This open-label , multi center PET/CT ( positron emission tomography/computed tomography ) non-randomized study . The study comprise 2 part interim analysis Part 1 . In Part 1 total 30 subject biopsy-proven primary prostate cancer enrol . Three stratum patient first part enrol base pretreatment recurrence risk assessment accord NCCN guideline : 10 patient low , 10 patient intermediate 10 patient high pretreatment risk recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET/CT Imaging Study Safety Diagnostic Performance 68GaRM2 Patients With Primary Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For inclusion , prostate cancer need histologically confirm MRI PET/CT [ 18F ] -choline ( 18F-choline mandatory ) available comparison . Diagnostic [ 68Ga ] RM2 inject intravenously subject , PET/CT image perform . Images assess visually quantitatively . Subjects schedule subsequent prostatectomy within 4 week PET scan . Prostate cancer confirm histopathological step-section analysis follow prostatectomy use Standard Truth . Based result initial 30 patient , expansion cohort 50 patient Part 2 enrolled increase safety tolerability database characterize uptake [ 68Ga ] RM2 specific subset .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written inform consent . Patients diagnosis primary prostate cancer prostate cancer histologically confirm result histology available . Patient plan prostatectomy ( within 4 week follow [ 68Ga ] RM2 scan ) . Patient MRI , [ 18F ] choline PET/CT ( available ) , primary detection stag image result available ( Note : [ 18F ] choline PET/CT optional ) MRI examination already schedule time screen visit date prostatectomy . The MRI [ 18F ] choline PET/CT refer criterion 5 perform preferably within 5 day prior plan image [ 68Ga ] RM2 . The maximum interval MRI [ 18F ] choline PET/CT treatment [ 68Ga ] RM2 PET/CT 6 week . However , require , MRI examination also perform [ 68Ga ] RM2 PET/CT , already schedule time screen visit date prostatectomy . No chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biopsy immune/biologic therapy MRI [ 18F ] choline PET/CT ( perform ) [ 68Ga ] RM2 PET/CT perform schedule . NOTE : If MRI perform [ 68Ga ] RM2 PET/CT , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biopsy immune/biologic therapy [ 68Ga ] RM2 PET/CT MRI examination allow . Recovery ( exclude alopecia ) previous surgery , radiation , chemotherapy ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status 02 ( see Attachments ) . No clinically relevant deviation renal function determine Cockcroft Gault method use serum creatinine screening . No malfunction equivalent CTC ( Common toxicity criterion ) toxicity grade &gt; 2 liver ( ALT ; bilirubin ) . Life expectancy least 3 month . Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease prostate cancer ( e.g . poorly control diabetes , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 12 month prior plan injection [ 68Ga ] RM2 , unstable uncontrolled hypertension , chronic renal hepatic disease , severe pulmonary disease ) could compromise participation study . Known sensitivity study drug component preparation . Patient custody order authority court law . Patient relative investigator , student investigator otherwise dependent . Patient participate another clinical study involve administration investigational drug time well precede 4 week radiotracer administration . Participation another clinical study involve administration investigational drug end within precede 4 week radiotracer administration . Unwillingness inability comply protocol . Patient fulfil criterion opinion investigator preclude participation scientific reason , reason compliance , reason patient 's safety . Hematological biochemical parameter outside normal range consider clinically significant investigator , i.e . CTC ( Common toxicity criterion ) toxicity grade &gt; 2 . Minor deviation lab parameter consider evaluate physician clinically significant respect safety interpretation study result consider exclusion criterion . History significant occupational exposure ionize radiation monitor occupational radiation exposure ( accord recommendation current guideline ) . Donation blood within 12 week plasmapheresis within 2 week radiotracer Administration .</criteria>
