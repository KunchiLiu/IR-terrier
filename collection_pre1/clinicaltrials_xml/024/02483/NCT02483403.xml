	<brief_title>Longitudinal 3He Magnetic Resonance Imaging Healthy Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Briefly , single four hour visit , subject perform : 1 ) physical exam , 2 ) full pulmonary function test , 3 ) cycle ergometry , 4 ) dyspnea exertion score use Borg scale , 5 ) BOLD Questionnaire 6 ) 3He MRI bronchodilation deep inspiration , potentially 25 minute inhalation 2 puff ( 200 µg ) short-acting bronchodilator salbutamol subject respond 3He MRI ventilation improvement deep inhalation . Hand-held spirometry perform post deep inspiration , post salbutamol receive salbutamol . Subjects first provide write informed consent screen MRI compatibility complete dyspnea exertion scale , full pulmonary function test . A physical exam include vital sign medical smoke history perform . Subjects complete Bold Occupational Questionnaire rest approximately 15 minute cycle ergometry , include pre-and-post Borg scale evaluation . After completion cycle ergometry , subject rest upright 15 minute prepare MRI perform 3 occasion within 1 hour : 1 ) deep inspiration , 2 ) 3 minute later deep inspiration , 3 ) 25 minute later inhalation 2 puff salbutamol subject respond deep inhalation . Images obtain post deep inhalation assess spot determine administration salbutamol require resolve ventilation defect . Hand-held spirometry also perform post deep inspiration post salbutamol receive salbutamol .</detailed_description>
