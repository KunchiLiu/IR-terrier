	<detailed_description>Study Design : Part A Randomized , open-label study treatment naïve treatment experience adult chronic genotype 4 HCV infection . Treatment-naïve define never receive treatment HCV interferon ( IFN ) , RBV , approve experimental HCV specific direct acting antiviral . Treatment-experienced define : 1 . IFN Intolerant 2 . Non-response 3 . Relapse/Breakthrough It plan 40 + 40 subject enrol study approximate even number treatment naïve treatment experienced subject enrol across 2 treatment arm : Arm 1 Sofosbuvir 400 mg daily +RBV ( 1000 mg/day ) 12-24 week Arm 2 Single Dose ( 2 tablet ) daily tablet contain SOF 200 mg , RBV 500 mg , Natural anti-hemolytic ( AH ) 200 mg 12-24 week Treatment assignment stratify accord prior treatment experience presence absence cirrhosis . Cohorts : Cohort single-arm , open-label , non-randomized design subject complete treatment Part A study SOF+RBV 12-24 week Part B study single dose EHCV ( 2 Tablet ) contain SOF/RBV/AH FDC 12-24 week . Diagnosis Main Eligibility Criteria : HCV RNA &gt; 104 IU/mL HCV RNA &gt; LLOQ achieve SVR 12 complete prior treatment study chronic genotype 4 HCV infection . Treatment-naïve treatment experience adult , male non-pregnant/non-lactating female subject , age 18 year old . See Section 1 1.2 protocol detail Inclusion Exclusion criterion . Study Procedures/ Frequency : Study visit subject occur screening , Baseline/Day 1 . On-treatment visit occur follow : • Part A , Arm 1 2 - end Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 All subject complete 4-Week Post-treatment visit regardless treatment duration . Subjects HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ continue 12 Week 24 Week Post treatment visit unless confirmed viral relapse occur time subject early terminate study . Screening assessment include safety laboratory test ( chemistry , hematology , coagulation , urinalysis ) , 12 lead ECG , HCV RNA , serology ( HBV , HIV ) , hemoglobin A1c , urine drug screen , liver image , serum B-hCG ( female subject child-bearing potential ) , physical examination ( height bodyweight ) , vital sign , medical history , concomitant medication , adverse event . In addition , subject screen Part A Part B ( Cohort 1 ) HCV genotyping IL28B genotyping perform . On-treatment assessment include safety laboratory test ( chemistry , hematology , coagulation ) , HCV RNA , urine pregnancy test ( female subject child-bearing potential ) , physical examination , vital sign , concomitant medication , adverse event . Post-treatment assessment include HCV RNA , urine pregnancy test ( female subject child-bearing potential ) , vital sign , concomitant medication , adverse event . Samples collect Baseline/Day 1 every visit Plasma sample collect treatment visit pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis study drug ( Part A ) . Untested sample archive 10 year . Test Product , Dose , Mode Administration : SOF manufacture 400 mg tablet oral administration . Subjects take 1 tablet total dose 400 mg orally daily morning RBV ( 1000 mg ) splitted 2 dos daily 600 mg morning 400 mg even food 12-24 week . The fixed dose EHCV combination Single Dose ( 2 tablet ) daily tablet contain SOF 200 mg , RBV 500 mg , Natural anti-hemolytic ( AH ) 200 mg . Subjects take 2 tablet food 12-24 week . Reference Therapy , Dose , Mode Administration : None Criteria Evaluation : Safety : Adverse event collect baseline 4 Week Post-Treatment Visit AEs relate study procedure , collect subject sign consent form . Clinical laboratory test perform treatment 12 Week Post-Treatment Visit . Efficacy : Efficacy evaluate use schedule assessment HCV RNA perform use COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Test , v2.0 Use High Pure System . PK Part A . A single PK blood sample collect study visit Treatment . Statistical Methods : The primary efficacy endpoint SVR12 ( ie , HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ 12 week post-treatment ) subject randomize treat . No statistical hypothesis test perform . For two treatment group , 2-sided 95 % confidence interval use exact binomial distribution construct . Part A : With sample size 40 subject arm , two side 95 % exact confidence interval extend 29 % length . Part B : With sample size 40 subject treatment group Cohort 1 , 2-sided 95 % exact confidence interval extend 32 % length . Secondary efficacy endpoint include proportion subject SVR4 SVR24 . All continuous endpoint summarize use 8 number summary ( n , mean , standard deviation , median , Q1 , Q3 , minimum , maximum ) treatment duration . All categorical endpoint summarize number percentage subject meet endpoint definition . Safety endpoint analyze number percent subject event abnormalities categorical value use 8 number summary ( n , mean , standard deviation , median , Q1 , Q3 , minimum , maximum ) continuous data treatment group . Data Part B analyze separately Part A may report separately . This study conduct accordance guideline Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs ) include archive essential document .</detailed_description>
