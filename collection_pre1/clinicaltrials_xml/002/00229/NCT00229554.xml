	<detailed_description>Background / Rationale : Despite strong evidence effectiveness cost-effectiveness variety colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen method reduce CRC mortality , current CRC screening rate fall far level need significantly impact CRC mortality . Unfortunately , however , exist literature patient CRC screen behavior yet provide sufficient evidence base make sound recommendation regard effectively improve upon rate VA . This study inform future CRC screen promotion effort make important scientific contribution exist literature : ( ) delineate relative contribution patient cognitive , environmental background factor CRC screen behavior use multi-level , theory drive analysis approach nationally representative sample , ( b ) identifying determinant variation CRC screen behavior across vulnerable population subgroup . Objective ( ) : The overall goal study address significant gap exist evidence base order inform development effective patient-directed intervention increase CRC screen among veteran age 50 old . This accomplished use data collect mail patient survey theory-based analysis approach uncover key barrier screen adherence identify fruitful intervention approach modify . The specific primary objective study : ( 1 ) Estimate relative effect patient cognitive ( knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy ) , environmental ( social network medical care characteristic ) , background ( demographic , health status , prior screen experience ) factor CRC screen behavior ; ( 2 ) Identify factor contribute disparity CRC screen behavior race/ethnicity patient characteristic ; ( 3 ) Identify analysis : ( ) priority population subgroup target future intervention ( i.e. , great risk fail screen ) , ( b ) priority factor target future intervention ( i.e. , strongly associate CRC screen also prevalent target population amenable intervention , well likely ameliorate race disparity ) . Secondary objective include : ( 1 ) assess patient value preference regard various CRC screen modality option , ( 2 ) estimate stage readiness adopt CRC screen study population , ( 3 ) validating measure CRC knowledge self-reported screening behavior . Methods : This observational study base nationally representative , cross-sectional mail survey 3,744 male female veteran age 50-75 one primary care visit VA Medical facility past two year . The survey sample drawn use two stage procedure first randomly select 24 VA facility stratify size racial mix select simple random sample 156 eligible veteran sample facility . Prior national survey , pilot survey conduct purpose refining study instrument study protocol . The sample consist 900 randomly select veteran Minneapolis VA Medical Center meeting sample eligibility criterion use national mail survey . The mailed patient questionnaire , make primarily previously validate measure , include measure self-reported CRC screening behavior ; patient demographic , health , social network medical care characteristic ; CRC screen knowledge , attitude , social norm self-efficacy ; attitude toward medical care . Additional measure organizational-level CRC screening practice recently complete VA facility survey link patient survey.The primary outcome whether patient currently compliant CRC screening guideline ( i.e. , receive either fecal occult blood test past year , sigmoidoscopy double contrast barium enema past five year , colonoscopy past ten year ) . The primary analysis test ( use logistic regression multi-level , structural equation model approach ) specific hypotheses association measure patient background , cognitive environmental factor interaction . Additional analysis conduct include multinomial logistic regression ass patient screen mode preference determinant , logistic multinomial logistics regression analyse interaction determine whether observe pattern CRC screen behavior vary race . Status : Completed</detailed_description>
