	<brief_summary>MAIN : The benefit treat high blood pressure successfully normal level heart function regardless particular combination drug use . SECONDARY : Measurement heart function use comprehensive ultrasound image method ( Echocardiography ) objective test functional ability well predictor change heart function successful hypertension treatment , subjective sign heart failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Diuretic-based With Non-diuretic Based Hypertension Therapy Using Echocardiographic Measures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Successful treatment hypertension single medication rare . On average successful treatment require 2 medication . These medication work different method . One idea behind use combination medication hypertension benefit additive . There unresolved question whether observed benefit simply related effective treatment hypertension , whether medication special benefit independent blood pressure lower . Each contention justify clinical trial . However trial common flaw hypertension either effectively control treated subject , magnitude blood pressure change treatment different group compare . The result one large blood pressure clinical trial call ALLHAT trial recently fuel debate . The ALLHAT trial utilize subjective symptom sign heart failure , call FRAMINGHAM score , determine abnormal heart function , imply diuretic ( water pill ) superior new drug reduce frequency abnormal heart function . This study share flaw previous trial equal blood pressure lower group . Nevertheless provide evidence argue notion new drug well old drug like diuretic . Shortly publication ALLHAT , another trial call ANBP publish show group drug least effective ALLHAT superior diuretic prevent important cardiovascular outcome . Hence , currently clear difference various drug combination , effective equal blood pressure lower achieve . Another finding may confound clinical trial rely subjective score heart dysfunction ALLHAT , significant proportion subject advance heart disease unaware heart problem hence probably seek attention . This raise concern true frequency abnormal heart function might report study . Using modern tool Echocardiography , complete assessment heart dysfunction obtain . In addition objective test heart function 6-minute walk distance could yield reliable assessment worsen improvement heart function perform serially treated subject . In view discussion , study hypertension effectively similarly control could use answer question regard different effect various drug combination . Such study propose .</detailed_description>
