	<brief_summary>Cholera remain important cause diarrhoeal illness death Asia , Africa Latin America . Antimicrobial therapy important adjunct fluid therapy management patient cholera , give patient clinically moderate-to-severe disease since reduce diarrhoea duration stool volume half . Current therapy cholera limit increase prevalence multiply-resistant strain Vibrio cholerae O1 O139 . Tetracycline doxycycline drug choice treat cholera , multiply-resistant strain present area cholera endemic epidemic . There thus need identify alternative drug effect treat disease . Azithromycin , new macrolide agent , active in-vitro V. cholerae , attain high concentration gut lumen , long half-life , well tolerate erythromycin , old macrolide . In study compare efficacy single , 1.0 g oral dos azithromycin ciprofloxacin male patient , age 18-60 year , cholera due V. cholerae O1 O139 . Patients typical “ Rice watery ” stool cholera , sign severe dehydration characteristic cholera vibrio dark-field stool microscopy . Patients coexist illness may confound assessment efficacy safety eligible . Only patient V. cholerae O1 O139 isolate pre-therapy stool and/or rectal swab culture remain hospital entire duration study eligible efficacy evaluation . A write informed consent obtain patient enrollment study . Patients hospitalize full 5 day , ask return follow evaluation 7 day discharge . After initial rehydration , patient observe 4 hour , ³ 20 ml/kg watery stools period enrol study . Treatment random , blind study staff patient . Clinical success therapy define resolution watery stool within 48 hour administration study drug , bacteriologic success define inability isolate V. cholerae O1 O139 fecal/rectal swab culture patient 48 hour therapy , i.e . day 3 subsequent day study . Patients therapy clinically fails treat 3 day effective alternate drug without open study code . Ninety one evaluable patient require group show power 80 % type I error 5 % two treatment regimen equivalent ( i.e . 95 % confidence interval difference efficacy two group great 10 % ) . If single-dose azithromycin therapy find effective provide important option treatment V. cholerae infection , especially cause multiply-resistant strain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 182 evaluable patient ( positive stool culture V. cholerae O1 V. cholerae O139 remain study full 5 day ) require study . Patients meet initial entry criterion admit study ward ICDDR , B , weigh ( Dehydration Weight ) , assess hydration status rehydrated use intravenous polyelectrolyte solution ( “ Dhaka Solution ” contain 133 mmol/l sodium , 13 mmol/l potassium , 98 mmol/l chloride 48 mmol/l bicarbonate ) 3-hour period accordance WHO guideline [ 53 ] , re-weighed ( Rehydration Weight ) . Rice-based oral rehydration salt ( ORS ) solution ( sodium 90 mmol/l , potassium 20 mmol/l , chloride 80 mmol/l , bicarbonate 30 mmol/l , rice powder 50 gram per litre ) use primary maintenance fluid initial rehydration accomplish , however , intravenous polyelectrolyte solution use maintenance fluid patient excessive vomit ( usually &gt; 4 episode per hour ) rapid stool loss ( usually &gt; 10 ml/kg.hour ) , unable drink enough ORS solution maintenance hydration . Patients allow drink plain water ad libitum initial rehydration . All fluid intake output rehydration ( throughout study ) record . A stool specimen collect patient dark-field microscopic examination document presence V. cholerae . Following rehydration , stool output measure 4-hour period maintenance phase , call “ Observation Period ” , stool output ³ 20 ml/kg period also V. cholerae demonstrate stool dark-field examination consider eligible enrollment study provide voluntary informed consent . This observation period help establish patient enrolled study moderate severe disease , potential impact therapy evaluate ( therapy likely appear effective mild disease ) . On final enrollment study , complete history physical examination perform , finding record pre-designed data collection form . Patients enter study randomly assign receive either single , 1 gram oral dose azithromycin single , 1 gram oral dose ciprofloxacin . Patients enter study assign consecutive study number previously randomly assign one two treatment regimen , randomization do use computer generate random number list fixed block length 4 . Study drug administer completion four-hour observation period , least 2 hour last food intake . The time administer study drug consider beginning ( “ 0 ” hour ) study . For patient vomit within 10 minute ingestion study drug , dose study drug repeat . For purpose , study drug available duplicate . Such event record , data patient carefully evaluate . The study drug prepare identical form allow blind treatment . Randomization do Pfizer , USA also provide cod study drug . Patients hospitalize 5 complete day count time administration study drug ( Each consecutive , 24-period constitute day ) . The following clinical laboratory evaluation do study patient : - Body Weight : On initial entry study , initial rehydration , “ 0 ” hour study ( coincide administration study drug ) , 24 hour interval begin time administration study drug . - History physical examination : On admission , initial rehydration , “ 0 ” hour study , least daily hospitalization . This also include evaluation potential adverse event . - Vital sign : Oral temperature , pulse respiratory rate , blood pressure record admission ( dehydrate ) , rehydration , end 4-hour observation period ( “ 0 ” hour study ) , every 6 hour administration study drug . - Measurement stool volume : Will do rehydration period , four hour observation period , 6-hour period administration study drug . - Characterization stool : Individual stool categorize either watery soft form ; bad stool character 6 hour study period use categorize time period . - Stool culture V. cholerae O1 , O139 non-Ol ; Shigella Salmonella : Will do admission , study day two follow . - Rectal swab culture V. cholerae O1 O139 : Will do admission , study day . - Hematological study : Serum electrolytes , creatinine serum Sp . gr. , haematocrit determine rehydration , 24 hour administration study drug ( 3.0 ml blood required test time , i.e . total 9.0 ml blood ) . Complete blood count , platelet count do administration study drug , however , may also do subsequently clinically indicate . - Pharmacokinetic study : For first 40 patient enrol study , venous blood obtain determination serum concentration study drug either follow time interval administration study drug- 3 , 12 , 24 48 hour . An indwelling catheter two way stop cock introduce avoid repeat venipuncture take 3 hour administration study drug ; subsequent blood sampling do individual venipuncture . This require 1.0 ml venous blood , serum separate stored -70EC assayed . For determination stool concentration study drug , aliquot stool ( About 5.0 ml ) obtain stool collect 6 hour period first two day study , like serum , store analyze . - Handling Treatment Failures : If study treatment judge fail clinically patient treat 3 day agent azithromycin ciprofloxacin isolate V. cholerae find susceptible . The treatment code broken patient . Patients microbiological failure treat suitable drug determine antimicrobial susceptibility isolates .</detailed_description>
