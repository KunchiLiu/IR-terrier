	<brief_title>Study AVI-4065 Healthy Volunteers Chronic Active HCV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) common blood-borne infection United States worldwide public health problem epidemic proportion . Benign acute phase infection , HCV infection usually become chronic 70 % originally infect . Chronic HCV infection lead inflammation liver ( hepatitis ) , cirrhosis , end-stage liver disease , hepatocellular carcinoma . In United States alone , 2.7 million individual chronic HCV hepatitis . Standard treatment chronic HCV hepatitis combination therapy 24 48 week alpha interferon ribavirin . This combination limit efficacy , poor tolerability , significant expense term drug ancillary laboratory test . It well recognize new treatment option need efficacious , potent , less toxic , less expensive . AVI BioPharma pursue discovery drug HCV use proprietary Neugene® Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomer ( PMO ) synthetic chemistry . Neugene ( PMO ) compound , drug class , consider safe human activate complement , alter clot time , bind α-adrenergic receptor ( produce hypotension ) like phosphorothioate antisense compound . One PMO , AVI-4065 , identify likely inhibit 5 genotype HCV base vitro vivo animal model . There specific data confirm AVI-4065 inhibit HCV RNA dependent PNA polymerase ( RdRp encode NS5 ) HCV protease ( NS3 ) , non-competitive inhibitory fashion . The 50 percent Effective Concentration ( EC50 ) 308 nM , efficacy nearly 100 % 3 μM . These data suggest AVI-4065 capable inhibit HCV protein translation robust manner concentration achievable patient . In rigorous GLP safety pharmacology toxicity model variety animal specie dosage level 5 time maximum anticipated human dosage level , inclusive non-human primate , AVI-4065 consider safe , well tolerate without dose-limiting toxicity . Additionally , AVI-4065 Injection safe well-tolerated three dose-escalating group 31 healthy volunteer ( Part I ) serious adverse event . Adverse event occur , self-limited mild moderate require intervention ; observation hold true first HCV patient receive AVI-4065 Injection . AVI BioPharma 's first human use AVI-4065 Injection involve open-label , multi-center , exploratory , dose escalate design healthy adult volunteer . The objective part study ass safety , tolerability design potentially therapeutic dosage regimen . The objective second part study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics signal HCV virus response cohort HCV patient volunteer interferon ribavirin treatment failure . The ability drug effect baseline HCV RNA level study duration evaluate use conventional PCR-based assay . If promising result phase clinical trial ( viz. , 2 log decrease HCV RNA level baseline within study surveillance ) , provide rational basis additional clinical test AVI-4065 Injection among HCV patient treatment refractory ( viz. , relapsers non-responders ) .</detailed_description>
