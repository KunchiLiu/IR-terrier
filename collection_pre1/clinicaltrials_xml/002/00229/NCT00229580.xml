DEMOGRAPHICS : We eleven men one female enroll study . The mean age participant 55 year old . Five subject identify African American Black seven identify Caucasian White . Half ( N=6 ) group divorce 42 % ( N=5 ) group unemployed time enrol study . Over half ( 58 % ) subject complete college lifetime .

TREATMENT ACCEPTABILITY : After follow-up appointment ask subject ( N=7 ) rate acceptance study intervention session 14 different item range feeling discussion session rating therapist meet throughout study . Items scored scale 1-7 . At final follow-up 71 % ( N=5 ) report session valuable easy complete . Ninety percent ( N=6 ) subject complete follow-up also report therapist helpful caring towards session .</detailed_description>
