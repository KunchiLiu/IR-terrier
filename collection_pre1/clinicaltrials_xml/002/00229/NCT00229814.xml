	<brief_summary>Tectal plate glioma relatively rare tumor childhood report incidence 10 % . Their typical clinical presentation symptom sign hydrocephalus often incidentally diagnosed image work-up child hydrocephalus . Tectal tumor child comprise subcategory brainstem tumor unique clinical , image , spectroscopic feature . There debate whether truly represent brainstem tumor whether site benign cellular overgrowth . The majority tumor pathologically benign show minimal growth . Not tectal plate tumor , however , typically benign course . Some manifest aggressive behavior . There report past attempt analyze histology behavior tumor . None prior series look tumor include Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) analysis . It interest accord tumor occur brainstem usually indicate histology behavior . Although absolute , know tumor poor prognosis versus extremely good prognosis depend location brainstem . Yet always case act typical fashion MRS prove helpful . This study do look region brain , call tectal plate , child . This part brain involved tumor . Because location tectal plate , usually difficult risky get biopsy ( tissue sample ) area . Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) non-invasive imaging technique look chemical make brain . MRS may allow u good understand nature behavior tumor . However , order understand disease area , need look normal chemical make brain child without tectal plate tumor . Healthy patient ask participate normal volunteer . We anticipate total 10 12 normal volunteer MRS study .</brief_summary>
