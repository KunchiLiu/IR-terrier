	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study TAK-128 Treating Subjects With Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polyneuropathy frequent complication diabetes ; affect individual prolong hyperglycemia , diabetic neuropathy common develop world . Chronic , insidious , distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy autonomic impairment typical form diabetic neuropathy . Less common , florid presentation include autonomic symptom painful neuropathy . Although many patient relatively symptom , chronic polyneuropathy autonomic dysfunction predispose neurotrophic foot ulceration ; consequently , diabetes lead cause amputation today . Diabetic neuropathy dying-back polyneuropathy distal degeneration long nerve fiber advance centripetal direction . Multiple histopathological change observe , progressive fiber loss hallmark diabetic polyneuropathy . Other important feature include endothelial cell basement membrane thickening , segmental demyelination remyelination , axonal atrophy . Similar pathological change observe type 1 type 2 diabetes . The severity neuropathy indicate stage nerve fiber loss determine clinical , electrophysiological , quantitative sensory threshold feature disorder . The functional measure electrophysiological quantitative sensory threshold reflect morphological change clinical feature . Diabetic polyneuropathy etiologically relate prolonged hyperglycemia multiple consequence . Although strict glycemic control prevent neuropathy type 1 patient maintain many year , similar intervention type 2 diabetes mellitus less successful . Type 2 patient may neuropathy considerable nerve fiber loss time diagnosis unsuspected hyperglycemia precede year . Reversal establish neuropathy strict glycemic control certain occur , even maintain many year . Co-morbid disease often interfere strict management type 2 diabetes . Even among type 1 diabetes , minority patient successful maintain prolonged euglycemia . TAK-128 novel synthetic compound develop treatment diabetic neuropathy .</detailed_description>
