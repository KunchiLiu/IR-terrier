	<brief_title>Nasal Lavage Study : Comparing Single Versus Multi Sample Lavages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasal lavage relatively simple way measure degree upper airway inflammation . It useful research noninvasive , relatively discomfort-free , simple perform . Yet standardized method collect upper airway cell . The definition nasal lavage differ widely research group . The method , pool modification , choose trial base commonly use Naclerio technique . Upper airway inflammation link broad spectrum disease : nasal polyposis , seasonal perennial allergic rhinitis , vasomotor non-allergic rhinitis , sinusitis . Assessing degree upper airway inflammation objective measure obvious clinical research benefit . For example , nasal polyp contain large number activate eosinophils - 20 % constituent nasal polyp tissue . Allergic rhinitis also associate elevated inflammatory cell count - eosinophil , basophil , mast cell , lymphocytes mediator . The impact treatment nasal inflammation key factor evaluation new nasal polyp allergic rhinitis therapy . Therefore imperative nasal inflammation measurement evaluate reliability . As nasal inflammation present variety disease , cross section subject enrol trial . Nasal lavages perform nasal polyp subject , perennial allergic rhinitis subject , normal subject . This project ass repeatability single sample lavage comparison repeatability modify version , i.e . lavage sample conduct three time , 15 minute apart , pool , combine . We expect find high eosinophil count patient nasal polyposis , intermediate level patient perennial allergic rhinitis low level normal subject , base previous work . This project single-centre , randomize trial involve three set seven subject - polyp subject , perennial allergic rhinitis subject , normal . All subject blind assessment outcome measurement . The study comprise four clinic appointment . Appointments schedule seven 10 day apart . All subject randomly assign lavage sample group baseline visit . Group one consist single sample lavage visit one , multiple sample lavage visit two , single sample lavage visit three , multiple sample lavage visit four . Group two reverse order .</detailed_description>
