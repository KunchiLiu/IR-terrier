	<brief_summary>Clinical measurement renal function generally perform use either laboratory test nuclear medicine technique , however , technique suffer limitation . Notably lab test assess global , rather individual kidney , function nuclear medicine test demand perform well . Children brain tumor often treat chemotherapeutic order try kill cancer . Amongst known side effect drug use chemotherapy fact may damage kidney . For reason function kidney assess use laboratory test 3 6 month interval treatment . In addition , problem mention test also require separate visit hospital . Children brain tumor undergo chemotherapy also routinely contrast-enhanced MRI brain perform interval three month order evaluate response tumor chemotherapy . Recently , MRI techniques develop evaluate single kidney renal function . The aim study establish single MRI exam use assess effect chemotherapy tumor renal function . The result MRI measurement single kidney renal function would combine provide measure global renal function would compare obtained laboratory test . The MRI exam require require extra 10 minute scanning time affect rest MRI exam way . This study perform validate new technique measure kidney function . Patients ask volunteer study require serial contrast enhance MR scan monitor response chemotherapy . Because chemo-therapeutic agent toxic kidney patient 's kidney function also evaluate use conventional method , result test compare obtain use MRI . We plan study 50 child study . The additional procedure measure renal function add 10 minute duration MRI exam effect routine brain study . If validate propose MRI technique would allow renal function evaluate time routine , contrast enhance MRI exam would avoid additional test use radioactive tracer urine collection 24 hour . If successful , MRI could use measure single kidney renal function patient undergo routine MRI exam simply extend scan time maximum 10 minute . This would save patient additional visit hospital would advantage measure single kidney , rather global , renal function .</brief_summary>
