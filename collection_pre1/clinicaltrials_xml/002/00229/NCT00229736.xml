	<brief_title>A Study AAV-hAADC-2 Subjects With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient Parkinson 's disease , part brain call substantia nigra progressively lose ability send dopamine signal striatum . To compensate loss striatal dopamine , patient take L-dopa , approved drug convert dopamine essential enzyme - AADC . With time , however , brain loses remain ability convert L-dopa dopamine thus drug become progressively less effective . In therapy study , gene cod enzyme convert L-dopa dopamine ( AADC ) insert common , non-pathogenic virus ( AAV ) &gt; 90 % human expose . The AAV help transport AADC brain cell . AAV-hAADC-2 , investigational drug study , injected striatum surgical procedure . Patients undergo procedure would continue take L-dopa ; AAV-hAADC-2 intend provide , directly brain , miss enzyme need convert L-dopa dopamine .</detailed_description>
