	<brief_title>Comparing Treatment Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome Using Gabapentin Versus Lorazepam</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In current protocol evaluate new generation anticonvulsant agent , gabapentin . Gabapentin significantly interact alcohol medication , abuse potential , excreted kidney liver . The primary aim present application evaluate efficacy gabapentin comparison lorazepam ( benzodiazepine gold standard ) acute outpatient treatment alcohol withdrawal ( AW ) . In addition , evaluation lorazepam “ rebound ” effect observe current funding period replicate compare response gabapentin . Also , acoustic startle response use evaluate neurobiological effect medication underlie AW-related CNS excitation , immediately AW . In addition , effect history multiple detoxification parameter withdrawal symptom , CNS excitability , relapse alcohol use , crave alcohol , response medication treatment explore .</detailed_description>
