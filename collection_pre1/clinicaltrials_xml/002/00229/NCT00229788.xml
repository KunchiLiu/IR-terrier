	<detailed_description>Objective 1 : For child develop graft failure follow cardiac transplantation , retransplantation often consider . While center report equivalent result retransplantation compare primary transplantation , strategy remain controversial . We seek examine outcome follow re-transplantation child identify risk factor mortality . Objective 2 : Adult African-Americans report low survival follow heart solid-organ transplantation . The relationship recipient race survival follow pediatric heart transplantation previously report . Methods : We would like review United Network Organ Sharing database . We plan review database record heart transplantation subject &lt; 18 year age 1987 2004 . Indications retransplantation patient race characteristic collect evaluate . Analysis perform use proportional hazard regression control potential risk factor . The contribution economic disparity , insurance status HLA mismatch disparity outcome also explore .</detailed_description>
