	<detailed_description>There trend surgery , general , toward minimal invasion . This include transition laparoscopy/thoracoscopy open procedure , well reduction incision size open procedure . The goal minimally invasive technique reduce morbidity length hospital stay , consequent reduction hospital cost . There cardiac operation currently perform minimally invasive technique . One repair atrial septal defect , perform though small skin incision partial rather full sternotomy . Another ligation patent ductus arteriosus , perform muscle-sparing thoracotomy rather full thoracotomy . Both technique minimize scar heal time require post-operative recovery . We need confident affected outcome adversely . We need evaluate length incision base patient weight , operative time , hospital length stay , pain medicine requirement , complication cost . Hopefully , data lead new minimally invasive standard care without reduction outcome . We review chart November 1 , 2004 Children 's Healthcare Atlanta .</detailed_description>
