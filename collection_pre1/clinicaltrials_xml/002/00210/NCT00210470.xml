	<brief_summary>IRX-2 design activate body 's immune system well fight invasion head neck cancer . In pre-clinical study , IRX-2 show activate number different cell immune system . IRX-2 previously test study 13 patient advanced head neck cancer previously treat failed chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy . The trial specifically design test safety IRX-2 . Researchers find IRX-2 appear major side effect . Also , researcher believe study less advanced head neck cancer patient could useful obtain data safety IRX-2 well data possible effect tumor patient survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Clinical Trial Safety Effects IRX-2 Treating Patients With Operable Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IRX-2 biologic product contain multiple cytokine produce pharmaceutical standard phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) stimulate mononuclear cell obtain normal healthy donor . The IRX-2 regimen combination 2-week course IRX-2 , initial low dose cyclophosphamide 3-week course indomethacin zinc supplementation . The present study base large part observation make exploratory Phase 1-2 study safety efficacy IRX-2 regimen perform Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia ( INCAN ) , Mexico 's National Cancer Institute . Patients head neck ( HN ) squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) treat IRX-2 regimen , neoadjuvant therapy prior surgery advanced disease . Three different dos dose schedule study . Evaluation clinical safety include regular clinical laboratory evaluation . In patient treat surgery , evaluation tumor response undertaken comparison tumor size IRX-2 regimen . This study provide preliminary evidence safety possible efficacy IRX-2 pre-surgical , neoadjuvant treatment HN SCC . The regimen well tolerated patient , histological clinical tumor response observe . The current study utilizes IRX-2 regimen evaluate recent Phase 1 trial patient recurrent , refractory HN SCC perform INCAN University Kentucky , safety IRX-2 regimen study evidence clinical activity observe 2 10 refractory patient .</detailed_description>
