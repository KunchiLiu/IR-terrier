	<detailed_description>MS associate fatigue , attention problem , number cognitive difficulty . There treatment approve yet treat problem . Although certain immunomodulatory treatment may slow progression cogntiive difficulty , therapy progression new onset problem . Therefore , order treat problem , likely adjunctive medication focus fatigue cognition need . We hypothesize addition Provigil exist immunomodulatory agent ( Avonex ) lead improve fatigue , attention , overall cognition MS patient attention problem . Study Period : 6 12-month competitive enrollment period , two group ( Avonex Avonex +Provigil 200 mg QD ) undergo baseline ( prior start Provigil ) , 2-month , 4-month neuropsychological evaluation . Total length study , initiate , ( include 2 month preparation period , 6 12-month competitive enrollment period final four-month visit ) 12 18 month . Primary Objective : To investigate whether Provigil combination Avonex safe , tolerable patient RRMS . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine whether Provigil ( modafinil ) combination Avonex ( interferon Î²-1a ) useful treat deficit attention , measure objective neuropsychological test , patient RR-MS 2 . To determine whether combination therapy ( Avonex +Provigil ) favorably impact domain cognition reliant attention ( e.g. , memory , psychomotor functioning ) , measure objective neuropsychological test , patient RR-MS 3 . To determine whether improvement fatigue ( related treatment ) predict improvements attention cognitive performance MS patient</detailed_description>
