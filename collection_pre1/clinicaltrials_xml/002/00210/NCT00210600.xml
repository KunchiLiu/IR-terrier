	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , multi-center study . Eligible patient identify screening phase . After randomization , Treatment Phase start Day 1 , Week 1 visit . The entire study period 22 week , screen phase last two week , treatment maximum 16 week , safety follow-up four week . The primary objective study obtain efficacy safety data regard PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) administer 120,000 unit subcutaneously ( sc ) every three week ( q3w ) 2 patient group cancer anemia receive chemotherapy : 1 . Early Intervention Group : PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) treatment start patient hemoglobin ( Hb ) &gt; = 11.0 g/dL &lt; = 12.0 g/dL 2 . Standard Intervention Group : PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) treatment start patient hemoglobin drop &lt; 11 g/dL Hb &lt; 11.0 g/dL study entry . For safety monitoring , patient follow adverse event , hemoglobin ( Hb ) , hematocrit ( Hct ) , blood chemistry blood pressure measurement throughout study . All eligible patient hemoglobin &lt; 12.0 g/dL randomize receive Epoetin alfa injection ( 120,000 Units ) skin every 3 week maximum 16 treatment week .
