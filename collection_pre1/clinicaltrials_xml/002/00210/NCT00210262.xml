	<brief_summary>Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) impose significant burden early mortality decrease quality life 6 % Canadians affect . There grow body research evidence show use certain medication ( ACE inhibitor , blood pressure medication cholesterol lower agent ) reduce major complication diabetes heart , blood vessel kidney disease amputation . Unfortunately research knowledge appear routinely translated clinical practice . The propose study examines effect simple mail intervention patient physician improve use therapy . The strategy test direct patient education emphasis blood pressure lipid control rather use particular drug , physician , provision confidential prescribing feedback together target educational bulletin . With patient physician consent , health care administrative data use examine impact intervention . If successful , study identify low cost reproducible intervention promote use proven preventive therapy clinical practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Promoting Blood Pressure Control Cholesterol Reduction Prevent Major Complications Persons With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preventing major complication cornerstone outpatient management diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . While glycaemic control remain important , recent evidence support role blood pressure lipid use ACE inhibitor reduce complication . Effective intervention require ensure implementation finding . Since optimal DM management involve participation patient provider , strategy improve care reasonably direct toward either group . The propose study explore impact simple mail intervention direct toward patient provider rate use ACE inhibitor , Blood pressure lower drug Cholesterol lower therapy – ABCs - old patient DM . We hypothesize : 1 ) mail intervention include prescriber feedback increase ABCs relative control ; 2 ) intervention direct toward patient provider equally effective promote ABCs among patient select receive intervention 3 ) intervention direct towards cluster patient within physician ’ practice also change care provide physician patient , absence direct intervention physician . Practices 300 randomly select primary care physician Ontario , physician , 10 patient age 65 know DM practice recruit participate . Practices ( physician index patient ) randomize one 3 arm : 1 ) physician intervention , 2 ) patient intervention 3 ) control . In arm 1 , participate physician receive confidential prescribing feedback ABCs , mask intervention , patient receive educational material regard DM eye care . In arm 2 , patient receive mail educational intervention regard blood pressure lipid control physician receive education feedback regard eye care mask intervention . In arm 3 , educational intervention regard hypertension lipid provide patient physician receive eye care intervention . Data source claim data Ontario Drug Benefit Program Ontario Health Insurance Plan Ontario Diabetes Database ( validate , linkable administrative data diabetes registry ) . The primary outcome proportion patient receive ACE inhibitor , proportion receive 2 antihypertensive drug proportion receive lipid lower drug . All prescription receive patient include whether write study physician . The unit analysis physician . Data analyze multilevel logistic model covariates measure physician level outcome measure patient level . The primary analysis include data index patient three arm . A secondary analysis include patient diabetes age 65 within practice participate physician . This project elucidate role prescribe feedback guideline implementation explore novel patient-based approach improve quality diabetes care . The relative simplicity central administration propose strategy suggest , effective , could readily widely implement .</detailed_description>
