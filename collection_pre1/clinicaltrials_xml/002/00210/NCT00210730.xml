	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy epoetin alfa ( PROCRITÂ® ) administer subcutaneously ( sc ) every week ( qw ) vs. epoetin alfa ( PROCRITÂ® ) treatment patient cancer anemic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Duration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate hematologic response patient receive epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) therapy persistent chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression ( anemia ) completion chemotherapy administration compare patient receive weekly epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) immediately cessation chemotherapy . Further , duration treatment necessary achieve endpoint study . A No/Delayed epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) treatment control ( whereby patient control group receive epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) Hb decrease &lt; 10g/dL study ) use establish frequency magnitude change clinical end point may occur epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) treatment continue ( start ) patient residual myelosuppression chemotherapy administration end . A 2:1 randomization use give every patient great chance receive immediate treatment ( 66.6 % epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) treatment vs. 33.3 % No/Delayed epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) treatment ) . The study power show difference two group hematologic response . In study , hematologic response define proportion patient transfusion-free able maintain mean Hb level &gt; = 11 g/dL study without Hb drop &lt; = 10 g/dL and/or transfusion . The study hypothesis immediate epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) treatment would effective treatment anemia No/Delayed epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) treatment patient cancer persistent chemotherapy-induced anemia . Patients randomize 2:1 receive epoetin alf epoetin treatment . The start dose 40,000 Units weekly ( QW ) dose prior study ( 30,000-60,000 Units QW ) . If Hb level decrease &lt; = 10 g/dL , PROCRIT initiate dose 40,000 Units QW .</detailed_description>
