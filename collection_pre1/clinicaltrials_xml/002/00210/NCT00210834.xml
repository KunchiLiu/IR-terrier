	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Epoetin Alfa ( PROCRIT ) Initiated 40,000 Units Every Week Versus 80,000 Units Every Two Weeks Anemic Patients With Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , multi-center study compare end study hemoglobin level Epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT ) 40,000 unit administer subcutaneously every week ( qw ) 80,000 unit subcutaneously every two week ( q2w ) approximately 280 anemic patient cancer receive chemotherapy . The study hypothesis dose regimen PROCRIT 80,000 Units q2w subcutaneously ( sc ) non-inferior dose regimen PROCRIT 40,000 Units qw sc respect change hemoglobin ( Hb ) baseline Study Week 13 patient chemotherapy associate anemia respective dose regimen generally well-tolerated . The patient receive subcutaneous ( skin ) injection Epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT ) one follow dose regimen : 1- Starting dose 40,000 unit sc qw ( every week ) OR 2- Starting dose 80,000 unit sc q2w ( every two week )</detailed_description>
