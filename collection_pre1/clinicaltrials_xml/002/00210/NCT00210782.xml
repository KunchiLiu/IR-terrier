	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effectiveness safety two treatment regimen , topiramate compare phenytoin , prevent seizure patient new-onset epilepsy require rapid initiation antiepileptic drug therapy . Reasons require rapid initiation treatment , rather slowly increase antiepileptic drug effective dose , may include severe frequent seizure , high risk patient recurrent seizure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Effectiveness Safety Topiramate Phenytoin Patients With New Onset Epilepsy Requiring Rapid Initiation Antiepileptic Drug Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , patient recently diagnose epilepsy require rapid initiation treatment randomize receive either phenytoin topiramate . Patients equal chance receive either medication . Phenytoin topiramate approve FDA treatment epilepsy . The first phase study ( last 28 day ) double-blind , mean neither patient physician know medication patient receiving . Phenytoin use accord dose recommendation package insert . Patients randomize phenytoin arm study , receive dose day 1 1000mg phenytoin ( give 3 divided dos ) , initiation dose recommend product labeling . This follow 300mg phenytoin subsequent day . Patients randomized topiramate arm study receive 100mg topiramate day 1 continue receive 100mg subsequent day . This relatively rapid initiation schedule topiramate , anticipate well tolerated represent appropriate regimen comparison patient phenytoin arm study . Patients carefully monitor primary generalized tonic clonic seizure complex partial onset seizure ( two distinct epileptic seizure type ) 28-day double-blind evaluation period trial . If patient experience seizure 28 day period , either take study , offer option receive high dose topiramate open-label fashion . Open-label mean patient physician know medication dose medication patient take . All patient experience seizure 28 day period offer receive open-label topiramate additional 12 week . The study hypothesis proportion patient seizure within 28 day double blind phase study differ 2 treatment group . Topiramate 100 milligram day mouth 4 week ; phenytoin 1000 milligrams start , decrease 300 milligram day mouth 4 week .</detailed_description>
