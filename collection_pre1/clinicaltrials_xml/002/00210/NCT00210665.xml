	<brief_summary>The purpose study facilitate access trabectedin eligible previously treat patient soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) , expect benefit currently available therapeutic option may benefit treatment trabectedin . The safety profile trabectedin evaluate assess potential risk trabectedin treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Provide Access Trabectedin Participants With Locally Advanced Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma Who Have Persistent Recurrent Disease Who Are Not Expected Benefit From Currently Available Standard Care Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single-arm study . It consist 2 Phases : Screening Phase ( 21 day first dose administration ) , Treatment Phase ( patient meet continuation criterion ) . During Treatment Phase , patient receive dose 1.5 mg/m2 trabectedin intravenous formulation administer 24-hour infusion Day 1 suggest 21-day treatment cycle . All patient receive 20 mg dexamethasone ( corticosteroid equivalent dexamethasone ) . Number cycle specify study . Patients may continue receive treatment long obtain overall clinical benefit , ie , clear evidence disease progression unacceptable toxicity , judge investigator . Trabectedin first new class antitumor agent . Previous study trabectedin patient previously treat soft tissue sarcoma suggest treatment trabectedin result tumor shrinkage , disease stabilization , improve survival rate . However , hematologic toxicity , hepatic toxicity , renal impairment also observe patient . The safety profile trabectedin evaluate assess potential risk trabectedin treatment patient previously treat soft tissue sarcoma expect benefit currently available therapeutic option treatment soft tissue sarcoma . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
