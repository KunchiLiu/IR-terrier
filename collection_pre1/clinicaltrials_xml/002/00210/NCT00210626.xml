	<brief_title>Assess Functional Outcomes Anemic , Critically Ill , Trauma Patients When Taking Epoetin Alfa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall study design base assumption maximum increase red blood cell effect often occur subject ICU acutely ill . The study hypothesis high hemoglobin ( red blood cell ) carry oxygen delivers oxygen tissue . This increase ability injured subject tolerate physical exertion involve recuperative process thus recover earlier someone low hemoglobin . One milliliter colorless liquid inject subject skin weekly hospital stay weekly additional 12 week hospital discharge .</detailed_description>
