	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Effectiveness Safety Tramadol HCl/Acetaminophen Versus Placebo Treatment Painful Neuropathy Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study show tramadol HCl effective painful diabetic neuropathy . The treatment neuropathic pain often require use one medication , work different mechanism action , provide best pain relief . The pain-relieving potential tramadol HCl /acetaminophen treatment painful diabetic neuropathy come multiple mechanisms action combination pain medication . This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study . Patients experience painful diabetic neuropathy enrol . There period 3 week patient stop take medication allow study . A 7-day baseline period follow , time patient call Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) system every night bedtime record daily assessment include average daily pain sleep interference . Patients enter double-blind portion study randomize ( like toss coin ) receive either tramadol HCl/acetaminophen placebo . The dose tramadol HCl/acetaminophen placebo gradually increase doctor determine patient take adequate dose ; 1 2 tablet 4 time per day , 8 tablet per day . Every night bedtime double-blind phase , patient call IVR system report assessment average daily pain , sleep interference number tablet study medication take day . At end study , patient taper study medication . The objective study compare analgesic effectiveness safety tramadol HCl/acetaminophen versus placebo treatment painful diabetic neuropathy . 1 2 tramadol HCl ( 37.5 milligram ) /acetaminophen ( 325 milligram ) combination tablet match placebo mouth 4 time day 66 day</detailed_description>
