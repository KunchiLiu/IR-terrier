	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy ( improvement sign symptom ) subcutaneous ( skin ) injection golimumab treatment active psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) . Efficacy measure reduction sign symptom active PsA , include effect joint pain swelling , change x-ray related joint damage , psoriasis skin lesion , physical function , quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy Golimumab Patients With Active Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) agent show effective improve arthritis psoriasis symptom patient active psoriatic arthritis . Golimumab new anti-TNFa agent . This multicenter , randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug placebo take , dosage ) , placebo-controlled , parallel group study compare safety efficacy golimumab 50mg , golimumab 100mg , placebo subcutaneous injection administer every 4 week , subject active PsA . The total duration treatment approximately 5 year . In first portion study , patient randomly assign receive placebo treatment Week 20 injection ; others assign golimumab 50mg golimumab 100mg group Week 20 injection . There `` early escape '' Week 16 study whereby patient meet criterion minimal improvement joint switch golimumab placebo , golimumab dose increase originally assign golimumab 50mg group . At Week 24 , placebo group subject switch golimumab 50mg injection , patient continue receive blind manner either 50 100mg golimumab injection every 4 week first 52 week data fully collect subject ( database lock ) . After 52-week database lock , everyone unblinded golimumab dose , continue receive golimumab treatment Week 252 part long-term extension phase study , option adjust concomitant PsA medication and/or increase dose golimumab . The study hypothesis golimumab effective placebo term reduce sign symptom PsA , measure American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) 20 response Week 14 , inhibit amount damage due PsA see x-rays hand foot Week 24 , maintain acceptable safety profile . Golimumab 50mg , Golimumab 100mg , placebo inject skin every 4 week Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , follow injection either Golimumab 50mg Golimumab 100mg every 4 week , approximately 5 year total duration time first study agent injection .</detailed_description>
