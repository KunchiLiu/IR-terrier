	<brief_summary>This study examine specific gene change patient aniridia , disease iris ( colored part eye ) absent partially absent , correlate change clinical manifestation disease . In aniridia , eye often appear color , large normal pupil . Patients may impair vision cataract , glaucoma , nystagmus ( rapid , involuntary eye movement ) , photophobia ( light sensitivity ) , displace lens , underdeveloped retina , thicken cornea . This study focus particularly corneal change . Patients 4 year old old aniridia may eligible study . Candidates screen family history complete eye examination , include follow : - Visual acuity test use vision chart . - Eye pressure measurement . - Fundus photography examine back eye : The pupil dilate special photograph inside eye take evaluate retina measure change may occur time . The camera flash bright light eye picture . - Slit lamp examination : Evaluation front part eye special microscope call slit lamp biomicroscope . - Corneal thickness measurement . Participants blood draw genetic testing relate aniridia . Relevant medical information , include disease severity complication , obtain time . Family member may also request provide blood sample genetic testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project , Phenotype-Genotype Correlation aniridia , study specific mutation patient aniridia attempt make phenotype-genotype correlation . Specifically , study determine whether specific mutation prevalent aniridic patient predominant involvement corneal epithelium . A blood sample collect individual isolation DNA PAX6 gene sequence analyze . The principal investigator Brian Brooks associate investigator James Fielding Hejtmancik OMGS/OGVFB/NEI Chi-Chao Chan , LI/NEI . Associate Investigators collaborate institution include Edward Holland ( University Cincinnati ) Ali Djalilian ( University Illinois , Chicago ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients meet diagnostic criterion aniridia recruit NEI Collaborating clinic . While diagnosis aniridia expect create significant difficulty , every attempt make document clinical status family member include study , document clinical syndrome least one affected individual slit lamp photography . A total 100 subject recruit study . There specific exclusion criterion young age ( less 4 year old ) may pose difficulty obtain blood .</criteria>
