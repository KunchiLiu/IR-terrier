	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Cetuximab may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving combination chemotherapy without cetuximab surgery may kill remain tumor cell keep colon cancer come back . It yet know whether give combination chemotherapy together cetuximab effective give combination chemotherapy alone treat colon cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study combination chemotherapy cetuximab see well work compare combination chemotherapy alone treat patient stage III colon cancer completely remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Cetuximab Treating Patients With Stage III Colon Cancer That Was Completely Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free survival rate patient completely resect stage III colon cancer treat adjuvant oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil v without cetuximab . Secondary - Compare 3-year disease-free survival rate 5-year overall survival rate patient treat regimen . - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare treatment compliance patient treat regimen . - Determine prognostic factor marker predictive relapse and/or treatment efficacy patient treat regimen . - Compare safety regimens patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize , control , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord obstruction/perforation status ( obstruction perforation v obstruction and/or perforation ) , N stage ( N1 v N2 ) , T stage ( T1-3 v T4 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV continuously 22 hour day 1 2 . - Arm II : Patients receive chemotherapy arm I plus cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 8 . In arm , treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically approximately 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,000 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
