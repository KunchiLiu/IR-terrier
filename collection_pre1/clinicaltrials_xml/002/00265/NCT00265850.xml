	<brief_summary>PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study cetuximab and/or bevacizumab give together combination chemotherapy compare well work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer . RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Cetuximab may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin , oxaliplatin , irinotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving monoclonal antibody together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective cetuximab and/or bevacizumab treat patient colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab and/or Bevacizumab Combined With Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord physician-selected chemotherapy ( FOLFOX FOLFIRI ) , prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( yes v ) , prior pelvic radiotherapy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Primary Objective : - To determine addition cetuximab FOLFIRI FOLFOX chemotherapy prolongs survival compare FOLFIRI FOLFOX bevacizumab patient untreated , advanced metastatic colorectal cancer K-ras wild type tumor . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , time treatment failure ( TTF ) , duration response ( DR ) among patient unresectable advanced metastatic colon cancer treat bevacizumab cetuximab addition chemotherapy FOLFIRI FOLFOX - To evaluate toxicity , particular , 60-day mortality among patient unresectable advanced metastatic colon cancer treat bevacizumab cetuximab addition chemotherapy FOLFIRI FOLFOX - To describe patient unresectable locally advanced metastatic colorectal cancer render `` resectable '' chemotherapy There premedication guideline establish patient assign receive cetuximab . All patient must premedicated diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg ( similar agent ) IV prior first dose cetuximab effort prevent infusion hypersensitivity reaction . Premedication also recommend prior subsequent dos , investigator 's discretion dose diphenhydramine ( similar agent ) may reduce . Pretreatment acetaminophen may also use . There bevacizumab administration instruction patient surgery contemplate require . For patient elective surgery contemplate , bevacizumab discontinue least 8 week prior surgery . Bevacizumab may resume least 4 week follow surgery . Patients undergo complete resection metastatic disease discontinue protocol therapy may receive treatment treat physician 's discretion . For patient non-elective surgery require , hold bevacizumab long possible prior surgery least 6 week follow surgery . Patients receive minimum two cycle therapy . Patients allow receive ancillary therapy per protocol . Treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , surgery curative intent plan . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Locally Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer 1 . Eligible patient must histologically cytologically document adenocarcinoma colon rectum . Patients must either locally advanced ( unresectable ) metastatic disease . Patients resect primary tumor document metastasis eligible . Documentation residual disease CT scan surgeon 's note require patient , histologic confirmation metastasis strongly encourage . 2 . Patients history colorectal cancer treatment surgical resection develop radiological clinical evidence metastatic cancer require separate histological cytological confirmation metastatic disease unless : Either interval great five year elapse primary surgery development metastatic disease The primary cancer stage I. Clinicians consider biopsy lesion establish diagnosis metastatic colorectal cancer case substantial clinical ambiguity regard nature source apparent metastasis . 3 . At time randomization , intent treatment must indicate palliative neoadjuvant chemotherapy potential resection sit metastatic disease . 2 . Only patient wildtype Kras gene determine laboratory SWOG Solid Tumor Repository local CLIAcertified laboratory eligible . Patients mutation Kras gene ineligible .
