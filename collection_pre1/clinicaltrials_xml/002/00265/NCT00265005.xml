	<detailed_description>Hospitalized patient central access device screen . Ninety subject least one occluded lumen central access device eligible . Thirty subject enrol follow age group : 28- &lt; 34 week CGA , 34- &lt; 40 week CGA , 40 week 66 week CGA . Inclusion Criteria Subjects eligible follow criterion meet : - Ability provide write informed consent parent legal guardian comply study assessment full duration study . - Hospitalized premature neonate ( 28- &lt; 34 week CGA ) , term neonate ( 34- &lt; 40 week CGA ) infant ( 40 week 66 week CGA ) . - Presence central access device . All type permanent temporary catheter eligible [ e.g. , central venous catheter ( CVC ) , peripherally-inserted central catheter ( PICC ) , umbilical arterial catheter ( UAC ) , umbilical venous catheter ( UVC ) ] except hemodialysis catheter . The catheter must properly insert evidenced ability use catheter least intend purpose ( i.e. , withdraw blood and/or infuse fluid ) documentation correct catheter placement radiographically within 48 hour catheter become non-patent . - partial total occlusion least one lumen catheter . Exclusion Criteria Subjects meet follow criterion exclude study : - CGA &gt; 66 week - Incorrect catheter placement ( see section 3.1 ) evidence mechanical occlusion - By clinical examination evidence catheter migrate become dislodge . This determine confirm depth catheter position insertion adjust placement . - There evidence mechanical obstruction catheter portion ( ) visible catheter hub skin insertion site ( e.g. , kink twist catheter ) . - Occlusion due suspect drug precipitate opinion investigator - Active internal bleeding , involve intracranial retroperitoneal site , gastrointestinal , genitourinary , respiratory tract - Recent history ( i.e. , &lt; 6 month ) intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) active intracranial process could predispose intracranial bleed - Superficial surface bleeding , observe mainly vascular puncture access site ( e.g. , venous cutdowns , arterial puncture ) site recent surgical intervention - Any following know suspected hemorrhagic event within precede 7 day significant bleeding risk : - Gastrointestinal bleed - Intra-ocular surgery - Any following known event suspect hemorrhagic event within precede 48 hour - Major surgery ( exclude central line placement ) - Organ biopsy - Major trauma - Puncture non-compressible vessel within previous 48 hour - Treatment indomethacin within previous 48 hour - Received fibrinolytic agent within 24 hour enrollment - Known risk embolization , include history leave heart thrombus , mitral stenosis atrial fibrillation , acute pericarditis , subacute bacterial endocarditis - Known hypersensitivity Alteplase component formulation CathfloTM Activase® - Prior enrollment current study - Any condition investigator believe would pose significant hazard subject investigational therapy initiate patient know condition bleed constitutes significant hazard - Participation another interventional investigation trial within previous 30 day - Documented suspected catheter infection - Thrombocytopenia ( i.e . platelet count &lt; 20,000 ) METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT This open-label study subject receive CathfloTM Activase .</detailed_description>
