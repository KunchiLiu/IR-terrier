	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : AZD0530 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving AZD0530 together gemcitabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose AZD0530 give together gemcitabine see well work treat patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Phase I - Determine maximum tolerate dose AZD0530 give combination gemcitabine patient unresectable , locally advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . - Determine toxicity profile dose-limiting toxicity regimen patient . - Determine pharmacokinetic profile regimen patient . - Correlate toxicity profile pharmacokinetics regimen patient . Phase II - Determine objective response rate ( partial complete response ) prolong stable disease rate patient treat regimen . - Determine median survival , 1-year survival , response stable disease duration , time disease progression , clinical benefit response , progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Correlate change serum CTX level ( post-treatment v baseline ) response clinical outcome patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This phase I , open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study AZD0530 follow phase II study . - Phase I : Patients receive oral AZD0530 daily day 1-28 gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive 2 additional course achieve complete response stable partial response . Patients ongoing stable disease receive 6 course . Patients discontinue gemcitabine due unacceptable toxicity complete 6 course therapy may continue receive AZD0530 alone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos AZD0530 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . At least 6 patient treated MTD . - Phase II : Patients receive AZD0530 MTD determine phase I gemcitabine phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
