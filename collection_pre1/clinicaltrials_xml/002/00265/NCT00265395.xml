	<criteria>Adult subject age 18 70 year , either sex . Genotype1 hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) positive subject . Subjects must willing give write informed consent able adhere dose visit schedule . Confirmation liver biopsy availability : Availability liver biopsy perform within 18 month prior Screen visit , pathology report confirm histological diagnosis chronic hepatitis liver cirrhosis . Compensated liver disease follow minimum hematological , biochemical , serological criterion screen visit ( WNL = within normal limit , ULN = Upper Limit Normal ) : Hemoglobin value equal 12 g/dL female 13 g/dL male . White blood cell ( WBCs ) equal 3,000/mm^3 Neutrophil count equal 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count equal 80,000/mm^3 Direct bilirubin 10 % ULN acceptable . Indirect bilirubin 10 % ULN acceptable ( unless nonhepatitis related factor Gilbert 's disease explain indirect bilirubin rise ) . In case indirect bilirubin less equal 3.0 mg/dL ( less equal 51.3 µmol/L ) Albumin 10 % ULN acceptable . Serum creatinine 10 % ULN acceptable . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level ULN Screen . At Screen Visit , fast glucose must 70140 mg/dL . Results 116140 mg/dL require repeat fast glucose less 140 mg/dL HbA1C le equal 8.5 % . HbA1C must less equal 8.5 % diabetic subject ( whether medication diet control ) . Antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) must less equal 1:320 . Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) WNL whether euthyroid subject subject require medical treatment . ( subject require medication maintain TSH level within normal limit eligible inclusion/exclusion criterion meet ) . Confirmation principal investigator subinvestigator sexually active female childbearing potential practicing adequate contraception . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding must either postmenopausal , surgically sterile use 2 method birth control . While abstinence sexual activity certain method prevent pregnancy , female patient childbearing potential anticipate possibility become sexually active male partner must use combination follow 2 method : Contraceptive pill intrauterine device ( IUD ) depot hormonal preparation ( ring , injection implant ) A barrier method contraception diaphragm , sponge spermicide , condom , method birth control consider acceptable study physician . Contraceptive measure review female subject visit . Dual method contraception must use 1 month prior start treatment 6 month treatment discontinuation . A serum pregnancy test obtain Screen Visit prior initiation treatment must negative . Confirmation principal investigator subinvestigator sexually active male subject practice method contraception consider acceptable ( vasectomy , condom plus spermicide , plus relationship female partner practice acceptable method contraception ) . Contraception must use treatment period seven month ( 6 month , accord local label ) completion therapy , include condom use male subject pregnant partner . For subject history hypertension diabetes , write clearance ophthalmologist obtain prior treatment start . Pregnant woman , woman plan become pregnant , male subject whose partner want become pregnant , breastfeeding woman . Previous treatment chronic hepatitis C antiviral immunomodulating agent interferon ribavirin product , whether alone combination . Subjects weigh 125 kg . Suspected hypersensitivity interferon ribavirin product . Participation clinical trial within 30 day prior screen study . Coinfection hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , . Any cause liver disease chronic hepatitis C , include limited : Hemochromatosis Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency Wilson 's disease Autoimmune hepatitis Alcoholic liver disease Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) Drugrelated liver disease Active malignant disease suspicion history malignant disease within five previous year ( except adequately treat basal cell carcinoma ) . Known coagulation diseases hemophilia ; hemoglobin disease ( e.g . thalassemia ) . Known glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency Evidence advance liver disease history presence ascites , bleed varix , hepatic encephalopathy . Subjects organ transplant , except corneal hair transplant . Any known preexisting medical condition could interfere subject 's participation completion study , : Preexisting psychiatric condition , especially moderate severe depression , history severe psychiatric disorder , psychosis , suicidal ideation , suicide attempt . Severe depression include follow : Hospitalization depression Electroconvulsive therapy depression , Depression cause prolonged absence work significantly alter daily function . Subjects mild depression may consider entry study provide pretreatment assessment demonstrate subject 's emotional status clinically stable , case management plan must formulate subject ; management plan become part subject 's medical record . Craniocerebral trauma concussion , active seizure disorder require medication . Clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormalities and/or cardiovascular dysfunction within 6 previous month ( e.g. , angina , congestive heart failure , recent myocardial infarction , significant arrhythmia ) .

Cirrhotic subject whose ultrasound confirm hepatocellular carcinoma . Any condition , investigator 's opinion , could determine subject 's participation study indicate could interfere subject 's participation completion study . Subjacent disease potentially would require systematic administration steroid Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus</criteria>
