	<brief_summary>Previous work laboratory , many others , show body weight regulate . When anyone , fat thin , try maintain reduce body weight , many system affect energy balance ( skeletal muscle , neuroendocrine , autonomic system ) conspire slow metabolic rate thus favor regain lose weight . Individuals leptin deficiency remarkably similar weight-reduced individual . Their metabolism , thyroid hormone , sympathetic nervous system activity low despite obesity . While administration leptin leptin-deficient human result substantial weight loss increase energy expenditure . However , leptin administration leptin-sufficient human usual body weight little effect weight unless give dose 10-20 time would consider normal physiological range . This study examine hypothesis leptin `` read '' various system regulate energy balance indicator much energy store body perceives weight-reduced state condition relative leptin insufficiency . Within model , restoration leptin level present prior weight loss relieve much metabolic opposition keep weight . Preliminary study support hypothesis . Healthy lean overweight subject admiited General Clinical Research Center Columbia University Medical College place liquid formula diet . Calories adjust weight stable subject undergo test neuroendocrine , autonomic , metabolic function . All subject undergo in-patient 10 % weight reduction . Subjects study single blind placebo control design study usual weight maintain 10 % reduced weight . At either usual weight reduce state subject undergo single blind crossover placebo/control study receive placebo , lepin injection isocaloric diet either usual weight follow 10 % weight loss . Leptin injection give dos restore 8AM circulate leptin concentration present initial body weight .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The failure obesity treatment sustain weight reduction widely recognize . The central hypothesis study : 1 . ) Energy neuroendocrine homeostastic system alter maintenance reduce body weight manner favor weight regain ; 2 . ) These change occur weight-reduced individual state relative leptin deficiency due loss body fat ; 3 . ) Therefore change accompany maintenance reduce body weight reverse circulate leptin concentration restore present prior weight reduction.. Maintenance reduce body weight associate integrated autonomic neuroendocrine change reduce energy expenditure increase food intake manner similar see rodent human deficient , resistant , adipocyte-derived hormone leptin . Systemic leptin administration leptin-deficient rodent human revers metabolic ( hypometabolism , hyperphagia ) , autonomic ( increase parasympathetic decrease sympathetic nervous system tone ) , neuroendocrine ( increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity , decrease hypothalamic-pituitary -thyroidal -gonadal axis activity ) change characterize leptin-deficient state . The proposed study focus neuroendocrine , autonomic , metabolic change characterize reduced-obese individual , effect phenotypes restoration circulate concentration leptin level present prior weight loss . Healthy lean overweight subject admiited General Clinical Research Center Columbia University Medical College place liquid formula diet . Calories adjust weight stable subject undergo test neuroendocrine , autonomic , metabolic function . All subject undergo in-patient 10 % weight reduction . Subjects study single blind placebo control design study usual weight maintain 10 % reduced weight . At either usual weight reduce state subject undergo single blind crossover placebo/control study receive placebo , lepin injection isocaloric diet either usual weight follow 10 % weight loss . Leptin injection give dos restore 8AM circulate leptin concentration present initial body weight . During study period , subject undergo detailed evaluation 1 . ) energy expenditure ( 11 day differential excretion heavy isotope water , indirect calorimetry rest energy expenditure , non-resting energy expenditure , thermic effect feeding , time spent physical activity ) ; 2 . ) autonomic nervous system tone ( serial blockade sympathetic parasympathetic input , heart rate variability analyse , urinary catecholamine excretion ) ; 3 . ) hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid , -adrenal -gonadal , axis function ; 4 . ) adipose tissue gene expression ; 5 . ) molecule ( e.g. , adiponectin , ghrelin , PYY ) may influence neuroendocrine metabolic function . We predict leptin administration reverse metabolic , autonomic , neuroendocrine phenotype characterize weight-reduced state . The result study delineate physiology body weight regulation leptin .</detailed_description>
