	<detailed_description>Physical disability poor health often accompany knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) , particularly people age . This decline function quality life complex phenomenon associate numerous factor include pain , poor physical fitness , obesity , co-morbidity , low self-efficacy lower extremity impairment . Furthermore , effect age , well study OA , must consider . In addition functional loss associate knee OA aging , low level daily physical activity exercise common problem population arthritis major reason activity limitation . Evidence accumulate exercise enhance health quality life modify number factor associated disability . There , however , little specific information guide exercise prescription diverse population people knee OA . Although general benefit exercise demonstrate , time focus research question specific type exercise produce specific effect ; particular exercise useful . Additionally , exercise show short term benefit , best maintain gain sustain exercise behavior self-directed community setting virtually untested . These question relevant people knee OA , become even important people grow old , become sedentary great risk frailty , poor health disability . This study design : determine efficacy specific type exercise examine effect train physiologic adaptation physical performance ; determine effectiveness comprehensive exercise protocol perform supervised non-medical setting , describe interaction personal characteristic disease severity individual response particular exercise regimen .</detailed_description>
