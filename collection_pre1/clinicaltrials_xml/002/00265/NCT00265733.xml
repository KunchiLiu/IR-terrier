	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel poliglumex capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give paclitaxel poliglumex together capecitabine work treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Poliglumex Capecitabine Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess tumor response rate adverse event profile patient metastatic , HER2 negative breast cancer treat paclitaxel poliglumex ( CT-2103 ; Xyotax™ ) capecitabine . - Examine distribution disease-free progression time survival time patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive paclitaxel poliglumex IV ( CT-2103 ; Xyotax™ ) 10-20 minute day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
