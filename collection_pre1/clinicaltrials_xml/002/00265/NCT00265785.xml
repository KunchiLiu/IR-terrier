	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , pemetrexed disodium , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Pemetrexed disodium may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well pemetrexed disodium work treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0526 : Pemetrexed Disodium Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess overall survival patient select stage IIIB IV bronchoalveolar carcinoma treat pemetrexed disodium . Secondary - Evaluate progression-free survival patient treated drug . - Evaluate response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , partial complete ) subset patient measurable disease treat drug use standard RECIST criterion computer assist image analysis . - Evaluate frequency severity toxicities patient treated drug . - Perform molecular correlative study patient tissue investigate potential predictor efficacy . ( This complete study close due poor accrual . ) OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord prior treatment gefitinib erlotinib ( yes v ) . Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenous ( IV ) day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 99 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
