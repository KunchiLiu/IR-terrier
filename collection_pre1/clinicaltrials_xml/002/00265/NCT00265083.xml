	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy subcutaneous injection ( skin ) golimumab treatment active ankylose spondylitis [ AS ( arthritis spine ) ] . Efficacy measure reduction sign symptom active AS , include effect back pain stiffness , physical function , range motion spine , quality life , rate spine damage fusion x-ray .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy Golimumab Subjects With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) agent show effective treatment patient active ankylose spondylitis ( arthritis spine ) respond conventional therapy . Golimumab new anti-TNFa agent . This multicenter , randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug placebo take , dosage ) , placebo-controlled , parallel group study compare safety efficacy golimumab 50mg , golimumab 100mg , placebo subcutaneous ( skin ) injection administer every 4 week , patient active AS . The total duration treatment approximately 5 year . In first portion study , patient randomly assign receive placebo treatment Week 20 injection ; others assign golimumab 50mg golimumab 100mg group Week 20 injection . There `` early escape '' Week 16 study whereby patient meet criterion little improvement AS symptom switch golimumab placebo , golimumab dose increase originally assign golimumab 50mg group . At Week 24 , placebo group patient switch golimumab 50mg injection , patient continue receive blind manner either 50 100mg golimumab injection every 4 week first 104 week data fully collect patient ( database lock ) . After 104-week database lock , everyone unblinded golimumab dose , continue receive golimumab treatment Week 252 part long-term extension phase study , option adjust concomitant AS medication and/or increase dose golimumab . The study hypothesis golimumab effective placebo treat sign symptom AS , measure ASsessment Ankylosing Spondlitis ( ASAS ) 20 response criterion . Golimumab 50mg , Golimumab 100mg , placebo inject skin every 4 week Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , follow injection either Golimumab 50mg Golimumab 100mg every 4 week approximately 5 year total duration time first study agent injection .</detailed_description>
