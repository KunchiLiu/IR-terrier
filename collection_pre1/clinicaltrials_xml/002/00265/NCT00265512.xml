	<detailed_description>Background : The prevalence substance use disorder ( SUD ) VA rise , make SUD ( ) among commonly diagnose disorder VA. A substantial body data attests effectiveness substance use disorder treatment ; predictor consistently associate positive addiction treatment outcomes duration . Despite body evidence support length treatment one strong predictor long-term SUD outcome , 36 % SUD treatment program VA meet continue care performance criterion specify Office Quality Performance . The propose randomized clinical trial investigate whether substance use disorder patient assign telephone case monitoring ( TCM ) continue care well attend face-to-face continue care usual ( CCAU ) ( standard outpatient care ) . Objectives : The objective research test , randomize clinical trial , whether in-person CCAU follow intensive outpatient SUD treatment lead good SUD outcome compare TCM . In addition , investigate whether continue care condition interacts distance provider telephone case monitoring ( TCM ) produce increasingly strong result relative continue care usual ( CCAU ) distance care increase . Should find interaction , test whether interaction due TCM produce well proximal outcome level participation continue care satisfaction treatment . Finally , investigate cost provide telephone care relative continue care usual . Methods : The design study randomize controlled trial telephone case monitor versus face-to-face continue care usual 2 site 500 patient per site recruit 1.5 year total 1000 patient . Patients involve intervention 6 month data collection occur baseline , 3 , 6 12 month via mail survey . Data interest include self-report substance use , psychiatric symptom , quality life . Data analysis conduct use hierarchical linear modeling . Status : Patient recruitment end . Treatment follow-up on-going .</detailed_description>
