	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use exemestane , letrozole , anastrozole , may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Giving exemestane , letrozole , anastrozole surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . It yet know whether exemestane , letrozole , anastrozole effective treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study exemestane , letrozole , anastrozole compare well work treat postmenopausal woman undergo surgery stage II stage III breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exemestane , Letrozole , Anastrozole Treating Postmenopausal Women Who Are Undergoing Surgery Stage II Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether anastrozole , exemestane , letrozole administer 16 18 week neoadjuvant endocrine treatment postmenopausal patient stage II stage III estrogen receptor ( ER ) -positive breast cancer choose aromatase inhibitor arm future study compare neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) treatment neoadjuvant chemotherapy . ( Cohort A ) - To determine whether patient high Ki-67 value ( &gt; 10 % ) 2 week neoadjuvant AI treatment experience high expect pathological response rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( 20 % ) would typically observe postmenopausal patient unselected ER+ rich tumor ( estimate 5 % ) , indicate early assessment proliferation useful approach identification chemotherapy sensitive subgroup ER+ tumor . ( Cohort B [ patient enrol 375th patient ] ) Secondary - Compare neoadjuvant treatment regimens relative rate improvement surgical outcome patient consider marginal Breast Conservation Surgery prior therapy . ( Cohort A ) - Compare neoadjuvant treatment regimens relative rate improvement surgical outcome patient designate candidate Mastectomy prior therapy . ( Cohort A ) - Compare relative safety neoadjuvant treatment regimen term report adverse event . ( Cohort A ) - To compare tumor pathologic size neoadjuvant treatment regimen , compare rate pathological complete response . ( Cohort A ) - To compare tumor pathologic size neoadjuvant treatment regimen , compare rate down-staging stage I . ( Cohort A ) - Compare incidence metastatic lymph node involvement three arm study patient lymph node dissection end neoadjuvant treatment . ( Cohort A ) - Compare neoadjuvant treatment regimen relative clinical response rate . ( Cohort B ) - Compare neoadjuvant treatment regimen relative progression-free survival . ( Cohort A B ) - Compare neoadjuvant treatment regimen relative overall survival . ( Cohort A B ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study comprise cohort A ( phase III study ) cohort B ( phase II study ) . Once cohort A accrual met ( 375 patient ) , subsequent patient enrol cohort B . Patients cohort stratify accord T stage ( T2 vs T3 v T4 ) , randomize 1 3 aromatase inhibition ( AI ) treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral exemestane daily 16-18 week . - Arm II : Patients receive oral letrozole daily 16-18 week . - Arm III : Patients receive oral anastrozole daily 16-18 week . Patients cohort B undergo breast biopsy 2-4 week AI treatment analysis Ki-67 level . Patients Ki-67 level ≤ 10 % continue AI treatment . Patients Ki-67 level &gt; 10 % ( high ) give option switch neoadjuvant chemotherapy undergo immediate breast surgery . After completion AI therapy , patient undergo partial radical mastectomy lumpectomy without lymph node dissection . After surgery , patient follow periodically 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 610 patient ( 375 cohort A 235 cohort B ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
