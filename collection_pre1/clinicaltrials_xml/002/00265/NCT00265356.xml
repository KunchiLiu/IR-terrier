	<brief_summary>The purpose trial improve management patient potentially surgically curable colorectal cancer liver metastasis . The primary objective determine impact pre-operative positron emission tomography ( PET ) patient assess resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases conventional imaging ( compute tomography ( CT ) abdomen/thorax , colonoscopy ) , determine proportion patient change management result PET .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Prior Liver Resection Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer remain leading cause death men woman . A significant number patient colorectal cancer either present , subsequently develop , liver metastasis . In contrast many epithelial solid tumour , resection colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis result long-term survival even cure . However , despite state art CT imaging , 60-75 % patient appear limited disease amenable surgical resection eventually die extra-hepatic recurrent hepatic metastasis . If occult micrometastatic disease become evident liver resection could detect reliably pre-operative assessment , patient harbor widespread disease could spar non-curative liver resection . This one present challenge liver surgery . PET image potential improve detection hepatic extra-hepatic metastatic disease , detect conventional imaging modality . This prospective , multicenter trial enroll patient colorectal cancer liver metastasis consider resectable , base CT scan thorax , abdomen pelvis , demonstrate evidence extra-hepatic disease . A full colonoscopy within precede 12 month ensure local recurrence , primary cancer time plan liver resection . These patient randomize PET scan .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic proof previous colorectal adenocarcinoma ( carcinoid , squamous cell cancer , gastrointestinal stromal tumor , lymphoma ) 2 . Contrastenhanced spiral CT scan thorax , triphasic CT scan abdomen pelvis perform within 30 day ( plus 14 day ) randomization demonstrate resectable metastasis ( e ) isolate liver 3 . Full colonoscopy perform within precede 18 month show evidence malignancy ( synchronous colorectal primary expect removed time liver resection ) 4 . Age 18 year 1 . Extrahepatic disease include enlarge portal lymph node CT 2 . Prior liver resection 3 . Previous radiofrequency ablation malignant liver lesion 4 . Systemic chemotherapy within three week prior randomization 5 . Radiotherapy within two month prior randomization 6 . Significant concurrent medical problem ( e.g. , uncontrolled diabetes , active cardiac disease , significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) make patient unfit surgery 7 . Pregnant lactate female 8 . Unable lie supine image PET 9 . Previously treat cancer nonmelanocytic skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix , unless diseasefree 5 year great 10 . Patients , time initial evaluation , already undergone whole body PET within 6 month prior randomization</criteria>
