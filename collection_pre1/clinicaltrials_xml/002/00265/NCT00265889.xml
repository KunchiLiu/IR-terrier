	<brief_title>Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Progressive Recurrent Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine 3-year progression-free survival patient progressive recurrent Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat tandem autologous stem cell transplantation ( 2 course high-dose therapy autologous stem cell rescue ) . - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine toxic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This pilot study . Patients stratify accord risk ( poor risk [ primary progressive , recurrent , resistant relapse ] v good risk [ first recurrence ] ) . - Salvage therapy ( patient relapse disease achieve previous complete response ) : Patients receive least 2 course salvage chemotherapy radiotherapy . - Autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection : Patients undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection . Patients inadequate number collect stem cell remove study . - First preparative regimen : Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV continuously 16 hour day -1 . - First autologous stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) : Patients undergo autologous SCT day 0 . They also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) IV 30 minute daily begin day 5 continue blood count recover . At least 4-8 week later , patient proceed second preparative regimen . - Second preparative regimen : Patients receive high-dose carmustine IV 1-2 hour day -6 , -5 , -4 , etoposide IV 4 hour day -3 , cyclophosphamide IV 2 hour day -2 . Beginning 36-48 hour later , patient proceed second autologous SCT ( day 0 ) . - Second autologous SCT : Patients undergo second autologous SCT day 0 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) IV 30 minute daily begin day 5 continue blood count recover . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 34 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
