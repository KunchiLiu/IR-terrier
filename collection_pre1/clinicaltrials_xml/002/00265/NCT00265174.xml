	<brief_summary>Numerous study document ability tumor shed DNA blood stream . Circulating DNA thus recover analysis , represent surrogate tumor material test potential application disease diagnosis prognosis . Detection genetic alternation one important test cancer patient since offen correlate clinical course , prognosis chemosensitivity primary brain tumor . Currently brain tumor patient molecular aberration analyze tumor tissue obtain surgery biopsy . Paucity pathologic sample poor fixation technique often make tissue sample unassessable molecular aberration . Therefore , ability extract tumor DNA peripheral blood hold great clinical significance . Still , molecular aberration evaluate serum DNA correlate verified comparison standard evaluation perform tumor sample . Our study aim evaluate feasibility use serum DNA routine diagnosis tumor molecular aberration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Backround : Genetic epigenetic abrasion like loss hetherozygosity hypermethylation gene promoter common aberration glioma . Detection aberration serve diagnostic prognostic tool . Examples : 1. oligodendrogliomas patient combine 1p/19q LOH within tumor respond well chemotherapy well prognosis , whereas LOH chromosome 10q marker bad prognosis . 2 . GBM patient hypermethylation promoter methyl-guanine-methyl-transferase ( MGMT ) tumor respond well alkylating agent good prognosis . As sample material diagnosis easily accessible minimally invasive procedure , much interest potential use nucleic acid marker blood patient cancer . It demonstrate LOH well hypermethylation could detect plasma/serum patient variety malignancy , suggest circulate tumor-associated DNA blood patient key determinant predict genetic epigenetic abrasion tumor . Objectives study : Main objective : find whether genetic abrasion serum DNA represent tumor DNA patient brain tumor . Is tumor DNA detect serum high grade tumor also low grade tumor ? Methods : Blood serum tumor patient obtain anonymously , patient sign consent form , prior surgery part procedure tissue collection brain tumor bank Hadassah . Part tumor stain hematoxylin-and-eosin Histopathologic diagnosis perform pathologist . DNA extract whole blood , serum tumor patient low grade high grade glioma . In order determine whether serum DNA represent tumor DNA , LOH 1p,19q,10q,17p,13q , 9p well methylation status MGMT promoter test DNA sample blood , serum tumor .</detailed_description>
