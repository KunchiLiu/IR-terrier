	<detailed_description>Most existing cardiac rehabilitation program little ability expand participation use traditional delivery model emphasize supervise , facility-based program . Futhermore , facility base program promote physical activity behavior patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) limit impact patient unwilling travel 30-40 minute participate program . CardioFit off-site , 26 week web-based physical activity coaching service people heart disease . Within CardioFit program , patient assign on-line `` coach '' receive customize exercise program base medical history , personal goal preference . A randomized control trial ( RCT ) plan evaluate effectiveness web-based intervention increase physical activity level usual care patient CAD . This study third phase three-phase research program examine intervention promote physical activity secondary prevention Cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
