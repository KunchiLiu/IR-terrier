	<brief_title>A Study CNTO 328 Subjects With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study use type drug call anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody , also know CNTO 328 . CNTO 328 new experimental drug . This study try good understand safety , tolerability ( side effect ) , distribution drug blood stream . The effect CNTO 328 patient renal cell carcinoma currently unknown . However , recent data show treatment another anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody reduce symptoms renal cell carcinoma . The study divide 3 part . Part 1 phase I portion study evaluate safety CNTO 328 subject metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Part 2 3 evaluate efficacy safety drug patient population .</detailed_description>
