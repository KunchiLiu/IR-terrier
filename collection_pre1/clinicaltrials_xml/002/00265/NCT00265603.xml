	<brief_title>Safety Study : Combined Modality Treatment Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death men woman United States . It estimate 170,000 new case lung cancer United States 150,000 death annually . Surgical excision currently treatment choice patient operable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , minority patient present early stage , surgically resectable disease . Most patient present advanced disease confine chest , surgically resectable ( Stage IIIB ) , metastatic disease ( Stage IV ) . Conventional treatment stage IIIB NSCLC concurrent sequential radiation therapy chemotherapy , standard treatment stage IV disease chemotherapy therapy alone , radiation therapy palliative adjunctive treatment . Currently , five-year survival rate patient Stage IIIB IV disease , treat untreated , less 15 % . We propose herein Phase I trial ass safety Transimmunization component combine modality treatment stage IIIB IV NSCLC incorporate immunotherapy radiotherapy . Extracorporeal photochemotherapy ( ECP ) , photopheresis , originally introduce management patient cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . In fifteen year since become first FDA approve tumor-targeting selective immunotherapy treatment cancer , induce partial response majority erythrodermic CTCL patient residual immunocompetence administer ( 150 center , 250,000 time ) throughout US Europe . Although combined modality data limit use ECP radiation , one study demonstrate disease free survival ( DFS ) cause specific survival ( CSS ) advantage ( adjust B1 status stage ) patient erythrodermic mycosis fungoides receive combination ECP total skin electron beam therapy ( TSEBT ) compare TSBET without ECP . In subset patient , persistent complete remission result therapy , suggest powerful clinically relevant cytotoxic anti-tumor immune response initiate . ECP distinguish form anti-cancer immunotherapy efficacy safety , evolution limit mystery mechanism . Recently , key cellular component ECP 's efficacy , namely simultaneous induction apoptosis malignant T cell monocyte-to-dendritic cell ( DC ) conversion , recognize . Repetitive cycle leukocyte adherence dissociation plastic ( i.e . acrylic ) face ECP flow system device lead synchronous differentiation , within single day , process monocyte extraordinarily large number ( 250 million ) immature DCs capable internalize apoptotic malignant cell process expressed tumor antigen . This engineer phenomenon may mimic normal conversion monocyte DCs insinuate endothelial cell enter interstitial space . Recently , find overnight co-incubation two population induce cell , prior re-infusion , allow efficient cell-to-cell contact processing apoptotic malignant T cell newly form DCs , thus provide rich source tumor-loaded DCs available tumor antigen likely process without need chemically isolate know identity . We term result transfer immunize tumor antigen DC capable stimulate specific anti-cancer immune response `` Transimmunization . '' By incubate patient 's treated cell overnight , rather return within two hour photopheresis , standard , able increase yield dendritic cell . Rather expose DCs malignant cell vitro ( overnight culture ) occur treatment CTCL , propose intravenously return DCs patient-after overnight incubation effort drive dendritic cell maturation-while patient undergo course radiation therapy NSCLC . Radiation therapy induces cellular death via several mechanisms-including Apoptosis . Since intravenous return ECP-induced DCs would first ( via right heart ) passage lung microvasculature , theorize DCs may gain access tumor . Direct anti-tumor effect DCs , well uptake tumor cells/fragments subsequent induction anti-tumor response potential beneficial consequence treatment . The treatment involve extracorporeal exposure leukapheresed leukocytes ultraviolet A activate 8-methoxypsoralen , molecule naturally occur small quantity variety plant product , include lime celery . When biologically inert furocoumarin transiently activate ultraviolet A energy , temporarily transform alkylating agent bind pyrimidine base DNA . Since single 8-MOP molecule bivalent , cross-links sister strand DNA form , inhibit mitosis gene function . It important note tumor cell present mix ( case leukemic cutaneous T cell lymphoma ) , therefore induced via 8-MOP/UVA exposure undergo apoptosis , normal peripheral T cell 8-MOP/UVA-induced apoptotic pathway consider critical driving monocyte DC differentiation . KLH ( depyrogenated , endotoxin-free ; Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. , San Diego , CA ) add concentration 10 mg/ml DC-rich leukocyte culture prior overnight culture . The cell place CO2 incubator 37° C overnight . The incubator commit solely purpose ; patient 's cell overnight ; lock . The following morning , patient 's cell wash ( i.e . centrifuge , re-suspended 250 ml normal saline , centrifugate second time ) prior re-suspended 250 mL normal saline infusion . The cell return patient intravenous infusion . Side effect standard photopheresis extremely limit required cessation photopheresis le 1 % subject . These side effect commonly include transient hypotension , due transient depletion intravascular volume , reversible reinfusion blood , occasional difficulty cannulate antecubital vein , fever hour follow infusion treat cell elevation serum uric acid , correctable oral allopurinol administration . The current Phase I trial transimmunization management advance CTCL 26 individual suggest improved potency conventional photopheresis , maintain excellent safety profile . As antecedent photopheresis , remarkably adverse reaction experience transimmunization , none subject Phase I trial experience limit toxicity require cessation therapy .</detailed_description>
