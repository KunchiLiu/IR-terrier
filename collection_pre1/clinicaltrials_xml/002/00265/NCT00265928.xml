	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving bortezomib together rituximab may effective treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together rituximab work treat patient relapsed refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , include Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Rituximab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess safety tolerability bortezomib rituximab patient relapse refractory , B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . - Determine overall response rate ( partial response , complete response unconfirmed , complete response ) patient . Secondary - Estimate duration response patient treat regimen . - Estimate time disease progression patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second weekly week 1-4 rituximab IV 5-6 hour weekly week 1-5* . Treatment repeat every 5 week 2 course . Patients achieve stable disease well receive additional 4 course bortezomib alone . NOTE : *Patients receive rituximab week 1-3 course 2 treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically least 18 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 46 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
