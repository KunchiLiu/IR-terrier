	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Cisplatin may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving radiation therapy cisplatin together cetuximab may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether radiation therapy cisplatin effective without cetuximab treat head neck cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy , cisplatin , cetuximab see well work compare radiation therapy cisplatin treat patient stage III stage IV head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Cisplatin With Without Cetuximab Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate whether addition cetuximab concurrent radiation-cisplatin regimen improve disease-free survival patient stage III IV squamous cell carcinoma oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx . Secondary - Determine impact addition cetuximab concurrent radiation-cisplatin regimen overall survival , local-regional control , acute late toxic effect , quality life , health utility patient . - Correlate expression epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) down-stream molecule outcome patient participate component trial . - Correlate pre-treatment PET scan finding disease-free survival , overall survival , local-regional control patient participate component trial . - Correlate post-treatment PET scan finding nodal response nodal relapse patient participate component trial . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord primary site ( larynx v non-larynx ) , nodal stage ( N0 v N1 , N2a , N2b v N2c , N3 ) , Zubrod performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , use intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) ( vs yes ) , pre-treatment PET/CT scan ( vs yes ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo either 3D-conformal radiotherapy IMRT twice day , 5 6 day week , 6 week . Patients also receive cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 22 ( week 1 4 ) radiotherapy . - Arm II : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour week 0-7 . Beginning week 1 , patient also undergo radiotherapy receive cisplatin arm I . In arm , patient persistent nodal disease ( stage ) ( i.e. , residual palpable radiographic abnormality ) undergo neck dissection* approximately 9-10 week completion treatment . NOTE : *A neck dissection optional patient multiple lymph node lymph node &gt; 3 cm diameter achieve complete clinical radiographic response neck . Quality life assess baseline , last 2 week treatment , 3 12 month start treatment , annually 4 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 720 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
