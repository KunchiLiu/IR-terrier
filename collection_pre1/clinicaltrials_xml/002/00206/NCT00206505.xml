	<detailed_description>Systemic chemotherapy operable breast cancer significantly decrease risk relapse death . However , possible identify patient outset likely respond adjuvant treatment type treatment use . Adjuvant treatment give surgery ( neoadjuvant therapy ) number theoretical advantage breast cancer , include reduction requirement mastectomy . Access primary tumor early treatment allow vivo test change molecular marker repeat biopsy may occur successful treatment . Established prognostic factor like tumor size nodal involvement important indicator breast cancer relapse survival show predictive sensitivity treatment . Estrogen receptor ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PgR ) expression predict response tamoxifen endocrine treatment . However , predictive marker chemotherapy establish . Overexpression c-erbB-2 associate decreased response CMF chemotherapy ( cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , 5-fluorouracil ) study . Accumulation aberrant protein express mutated tumor suppressor gene p53 product may associate relative resistance cytotoxic therapy . Tissue growth kinetics determine balance program cell death ( apoptosis ) cell proliferation , alteration two may regard key element uncontrolled growth malignant tumor . In vitro experiment suggest many anti-cancer agent achieve effect induce apoptosis . Mechanisms suppress process may , therefore , important development intrinsic acquire chemotherapy resistance . A clinical study report increase label apoptotic leukemic cell treatment . In breast cancer biopsy specimen , chemotherapy find induce apoptosis within first 24 hour treatment . Measurement biological molecular marker exposure may , therefore , allow early prediction likelihood response systemic therapy . Preoperative chemotherapy show result change biomarkers , change , correlate tumor response , may early predictor clinical outcome . New treatment strategy need improve clinical outcome breast cancer patient high risk recurrence . Even best present combination chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery , disease recurrence death least 60 % population . Thus , new strategy need improve survival . Recent advance may improve clinical outcome include use taxoids ( paclitaxel docetaxel ) , new class cytotoxic agent , report high response rate standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
