	<brief_title>The Role Amylin Glucagon T1DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To develop new treatment approach prevention hypo hyperglycemia child type 1diabetes . Background/Rationale : The diabetes control complication trial ( DCCT ) show improve blood sugar control individual type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) stop delay onset long-term complication . As result study , intensive management control blood sugar glycosylated hemoglobin near normal safely possible advocate . However , hypoglycemia increase 3 fold DCCT study major limit factor gain `` tight '' control blood sugar T1DM . Description Project : In health individual , `` meal '' blood sugar level carefully control . Insulin ( hormone lower blood sugar ) glucagon ( hormone raise blood sugar ) play key role maintain careful balance . Recently understand hormone call amylin also contribute careful meal blood glucose balance . Amylin immediate meal period work reduce glucagon , turn reduces liver release store sugar blood stream . In T1DM , lack insulin failure glucagon suppression lead hyperglycemia immediately follow food eaten . Also , glucagon regulate correctly meal . The glucagon normally produce body increase response hypoglycemia thus interfere delicate balance glucose production glucose use . Therefore , difficult get normal blood sugar someone type1 diabetes . Currently , treatment mild moderate hypoglycemia cause sudden feeling race heart , feel sweaty , weak hungry eat drink carbohydrate awake person . Severe hypoglycemia ( unconsciousness due low blood sugar ) treat glucagon shot . Unfortunately , treatment prevent mild severe hypoglycemia . The purpose study see give pramlintide ( manmade amylin ) insulin meal would lower hyperglycemia glucagon shoot give late `` meal '' time would prevent hypoglycemia allow blood sugar level improve people T1DM . The study outline proposal might help develop new treatment option target `` meal '' hyperglycemia high blood glucose meal hypoglycemia child . This study first time investigate role glucagon causation hyperglycemia role prevention hypoglycemia . Relevance Type 1 diabetes : Using naturally occur hormone dysregulated deficient T1DM wish restore normal glucose concentration T1DM . Such treatment successful would major breakthrough prevention hyper hypoglycemia decrease short long-term complication associate T1DM .</detailed_description>
