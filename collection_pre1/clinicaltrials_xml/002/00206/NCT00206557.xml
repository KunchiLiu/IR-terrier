	<brief_summary>The aim project investigate use raloxifene ( new form estrogen ) treatment schizophrenia postmenopausal woman . Raloxifene selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) mean affect central nervous system effect estrogen ( eg : improving emotional symptom , memory , information processing concentration ) , without adversely affect reproductive tissue / organs breast , uterus ovaries.We conduct double blind placebo control 3 month duration study compare psychotic symptom response three group postmenopausal woman schizophrenia . One group receive standard antipsychotic medication plus 60mg Raloxifene , second group receive standard antipsychotic medication plus Hormone Therapy ( estradiol 2mg oral per day + dyhydroprogesterone 10mg oral per day ) third group receive standard antipsychotic medication plus oral placebo . Hypothesis 1 : That woman receive adjunctive raloxifene HT would quicker recovery psychotic symptom , measure rating scale , compare woman receive adjunctive placebo.Hypothesis 2 : That Raloxifene group would well cognitive improvement two group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Estrogen hypothesise protective woman early onset severe symptom schizophrenia ( Hafner,1991 ; Seeman , 1992 ) . This “ estrogen hypothesis ” derive epidemiological , clinical animal study . Following result study , conduct study ( Kulkarni et al 1996 ) group premenopausal woman schizophrenia give 0.02mg oral estradiol adjunct antipsychotic drug treatment 8 week compare progress similar group receive antipsychotic drug . The group receive estrogen make significantly rapid recovery acute psychotic symptom also report improvement general health status . Subsequently , conduct 4 week double blind , placebo control study use 100 microgram estradiol skin patch . We find 12 pre-menopausal woman receive estradiol adjunct significantly low total PANSS BPRS score 12 woman receive placebo patch plus antipsychotic medication . ( Kulkarni et al 2000 ) . The major potential risk use estrogen longer-term adjunctive treatment pre-menopausal woman schizophrenia appear potential harmful effect estrogen action breast uterine tissue . Our study brief reason , use estrogen without progesterone 8 week 4 week period . With recent advent selective estrogen receptor modulators , particular raloxifene hydrochloride , potential harness positive estrogenic effect CNS neurotransmitter system without affect breast uterine tissue . While CNS effect raloxifene fully study , action mediate bind estrogen receptor thereby regulate gene expression ligand , tissue gene specific . By inference , raloxifene would expect impact dopamine serotonin pathways similar fashion conjugate estrogen . A study ( Nickleisen et al 1999 ) effect raloxifene cognition healthy , postmenopausal woman find slight increase verbal memory performance one month high dose treatment , difference find 12 month treatment . There study woman cognitive impairment treatment effect would likely apparent . Similarly , clinical study date investigate effect raloxifene psychotic symptom . To end , put forward investigator initiate clinical trial proposal investigate effect adjunctive raloxifene psychotic symptom woman schizophrenia . The aim project study effect raloxifene adjunct antipsychotic medication postmenopausal woman schizophrenia mean develop novel , safe adjunctive treatment woman schizophrenia improve quality life .</detailed_description>
