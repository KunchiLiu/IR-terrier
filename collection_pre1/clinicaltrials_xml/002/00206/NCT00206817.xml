	<brief_title>Rapid Assessment Cardiac Markers Evaluation Acute Coronary Syndrome ( RACE-ACS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The correct diagnosis acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) remain frequent significant challenge emergency physician . Over eight million chest pain patient present annually despite promising advance diagnosis , four percent ACS patient mistakenly discharge home . While history physical , cardiac risk factor assessment , ECG , cardiac marker determination include assessment risk stratification patient present possible ACS , assessment clearly far perfect . Improved rapid accurate mean assessment population ED clearly needed.ED patient chest discomfort screen approach study enrollment . Consenting patient meet study inclusion exclusion criterion enrol . Point-of-care serial cardiac marker measurement perform . Based web-based computerized randomization system , half ( 50 % ) patient willundergo routine central laboratory test . Half ( 50 % ) patient undergopoint-of-care marker perform ED addition routine central laboratory testing.In second group , central laboratory test result blind ED physicianuntil disposition time . BNP blind report physician first 500 patient ( Phase I ) . After first 500 patient enrol , interim analysis perform determine clinical utility BNP patient assessment . After physician education result , trial resume remain 500 patient ( Phase II ) . In Phase II , BNP level provide physician use time randomization format.The patient medical record follow period thirty day sixmonths enrollment .</detailed_description>
