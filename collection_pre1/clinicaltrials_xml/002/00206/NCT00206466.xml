	<detailed_description>Breast cancer systemic chemotherapy : Systemic chemotherapy operable breast cancer significantly decrease risk relapse death . However , possible identify patient outset likely respond adjuvant treatment type treatment use . Adjuvant treatment give surgery ( neoadjuvant therapy ) number advantage breast cancer , include reduction requirement mastectomy . Access primary tumor early treatment allow vivo test predictive marker obtain core biopsy occur successful treatment . Predictive marker breast cancer : Prognostic factor like tumor size nodal involvement important indicator breast cancer survival show predictive sensitivity chemotherapy . With endocrine therapy , prime example predictive marker estrogen receptor ( ER ) expression , predict response tamoxifen endocrine treatment . However , predictive marker chemotherapy establish . Overexpression c-erbB-2 might associate decreased response CMF increase response anthracycline-based treatment , observation still contentious . Expression topoisomerase II may also reflect responsiveness anthracycline chemotherapy . Recently , emerge data also suggest c-erbB2 may marker taxane sensitivity . As , lack predictive biomarkers could give early information effective chemotherapy whether additional treatment might beneficial . A test chemotherapy sensitivity , equivalent ER predict response endocrine therapy , would greatly facilitate treatment decision ideal scenario , treatment individual patient could base specific feature disease . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy : Preoperative chemotherapy large tumor ( &gt; 3cm ) inoperable breast cancer well establish standard care locally advance breast cancer . Data large series patient demonstrate preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy lead significant reduction tumor size ( downstaging ) improve rate cosmetic result breast-conserving surgery . A recent large randomize trial involve 1,523 patient compare preoperative postoperative chemotherapy ( NSABP B-18 ) . Although result study show difference disease-free survival survival woman preoperative postoperative doxorubicin cyclophosphamide chemotherapy , significant downstaging tumor achieve patient receive preoperative therapy able undergo breast-conserving surgery . The rate breast conservation NSABP B-18 85 % patient tumor great 3 cm , le 5 % patient report progressive disease receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . cDNA array : High-Throughput Quantitative Profiling Gene Expression : With advent high-throughput quantitation gene expression cDNA technology , possible study expression many gene simultaneously characterize expression pattern different breast cancer may distinguish molecular phenotype associate clinical response treatment . In recent report , molecular classification leukemia demonstrate . Bone marrow aspirate take 38 patient acute leukemia evaluate expression 6,817 human gene . The 50 best discriminate gene use create predictive index apply new sample find accurately assign AML ALL . Preliminary data differential pattern gene expression responder vs non-responders Taxotere chemotherapy : We conduct pilot study investigate gene expression pattern core biopsy human breast cancer responder non-responders Taxotere chemotherapy . RNA isolate core biopsy primary breast cancer take woman initiation Taxotere chemotherapy . Clinical response assess 12 week treatment . We compare pattern gene expression statistically order identify gene differentially express responder non-responders single chemotherapeutic agent . Overall , gene efficiently cluster tumor 3 group : CR , PR , NR . We select 2337 gene data analysis . As expect , majority gene show heterogeneous expression pattern independent treatment response , six large gene cluster ( approximately 180 gene ) appear predict likelihood response Taxotere therapy . Consistent apoptosis-induction mode action taxanes , responsive tumor appear high expression stress-related protein , mitochondrial protein involve apoptosis ( cytochrome , proteasome subunit ) , high level motility-related microfilament protein ( actin , myosin , tropomyosin ) . Non-responders pattern complex show elevate level microtubule protein presume target Taxotere therapy ( tubulins , tubulin-interacting protein ) elevate level inflammatory-response gene . Surprisingly , non-responders also show elevated proliferation ( KI67 ) oncogene ( ABL1 , MYC JUNB ) expression level . This molecular portrait Taxotere resistance differs expect profile general chemoresistance . Quantitative RT-PCR immunohistochemistry study confirm differential gene pattern expression progress 40 patient .</detailed_description>
