	<brief_summary>The researcher want learn whether ZD1839 improve activity tamoxifen , drug participant receive treatment type breast cancer study . Tamoxifen medicine part standard treatment type breast cancer study . It approve treatment problem . In order help researcher understand cancer respond medicine , researcher take small tissue sample ( biopsy ) breast cancer begin treatment two week treatment , 6 week surgery do part treatment cancer . If participant respond treatment , another biopsy do see participant respond . These sample also collect look different characteristic cancer . The researcher guarantee participant benefit take part study</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) express over-expressed many human solid tumor play important role progression invasion metastasis . The EGFR tyrosine kinase activate bind variety ligands external domain . Autophosphorylation EGFR tyrosine kinase initiate signal cascade feed downstream cell cycle control machinery regulate cell proliferation , reaction major component growth factor-induced proliferation cancer cell . The Erb-B ( HER ) receptor family consist four transmembrane tyrosine kinase : Erb-B1-epithermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR , HER1 ) , Erb-B2/neu ( HER2 ) , Erb-B3 ( HER3 ) , Erb-B4 ( HER4 ) . The ectodomain Erb-B1 , Erb-B3 , Erb-B4 interacts specific set ligand , whereas ligand identify thus far Erb-B2 receptor . Nonetheless , Erb-B2 activate ligand-activated Erb-B coreceptors . Upon ligand bind active domain Erb-B1 , Erb-B3 , Erb-B4 , receptor preferentially recruit Erb-B2 heterodimeric complex Erb-B2 kinase modulate receptor internalization prolong signal transduction . Data emerge Erb-B2 modulates cellular p27 cyclin D1 protein level Ras/MAP kinase PI3K/Akt signaling . Reversible interruption Erb-B2 function trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) show inhibit MAPk reduce MAPk-mediated transcription cyclin D1 . In addition , signal molecule Akt important cell survival pathway . Akt inhibit apoptosis present PI3 kinase pathway , activate EGF family IGF family . Several biologic argument support use EGR inhibitor block HER2 signal . In HER2-overexpressing cell line , HER2 receptor constitutively phosphorylated . This suggest HER2 may transactivated ligand-stimulated EGFR , also present tumor cell . In addition , overexpression HER2 enhance bind EGFR ligands receptor potentiates EGFR signal . HER2 inactivation show impair EGFR- mediate transformation , conversely EGFR block antibody augment growth inhibitory effect antiHER2 antibody cell high level HER2 . Taken together , data suggest EGFR/HER2 crosstalk present subset human tumor interruption EGFR may reduce HER2 signal . Cell cycle progression regulate predominantly cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDKs ) , turn control family CDK inhibitory protein include P27KIP1 P21CIP1-WAF1 . Pathways involve CDK inhibitor commonly destructive cancer cell . ZD1839 orally active , selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor block signal transduction pathway implicate cancer cell proliferation , survival , host-dependent process promote cancer growth . In preclinical study , ZD1839 cause tumor growth delay range cancer cell line xenograft , tumor regression observe high dos . ZD1839 also show inhibit proliferation DCIS together significantly increase apoptosis tissue . Data different cell line xenografts suggest ZD1839 may act via dose-dependent growth inhibition increase apoptosis , may even potentiate activity cytotoxic chemotherapy . In one phase II multicenter study , 63 woman metastatic breast cancer could number previous chemotherapy hormonal regimen treat oral daily dose 500 mg ZD1839 disease progression , intolerable toxicity , withdrawal consent . Dosage reduction 250 mg daily allow toxicity . The primary end point clinical benefit rate ( complete response + partial response [ modify ICC/WHO criterion ] + stable disease ) 6 month . There 1 partial response 2 patient stable disease 4 month ( 4 month 1 patient 7+ month ) , total 4.8 % clinical benefit . An additional 4 patient stable disease last 1 2 month , another 2 patient stable disease last 1 month , result overall 14.3 % partial response stable disease heavily pre-treated population ; 15 % treatment 4 8+ month , 2 patient stayed treatment , despite progression , significant bone pain palliation . Preliminary efficacy toxicity data another phase II trial 22 ER-positive ER-negative patient report conference . In study , patient could 1 previous chemotherapy regimen experience disease progression tamoxifen give 500 mg ZD1839 daily . Two patient partial response 10 stable disease 4 week . In trial toxicity profile identical see patient NSCLC .</detailed_description>
