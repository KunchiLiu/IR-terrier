	<brief_summary>The purpose study see give growth hormone Lupron along thyroid hormone improve final height patient long term hypothyroidism . Lupron medicine use delay puberty prevent early closure grow bone might increase growth potential . Growth hormone use restore growth rate . This study include child `` short term '' `` long term '' hypothyroidism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Growth Hormone GnRH Agonist Adolescents With Acquired Hypothyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothyroidism often associate growth failure . It take several year slow growth notice . This growth retardation typically severe progressive . Thyroid hormone necessary normal growth . Treatment thyroxine ( thyroid hormone ) result rapid catch-up growth , mostly happen first 18 month . Growth accompany increase bone age , mean early fusion ( closure grow bone ) bone reduce growth potential . For example , patient , 10 year old bone age 12 year , growth potential 12 year old stop grow 2 year earlier 10 year old patient . According literature , prolong juvenile hypothyroidism ( low thyroid condition ) result permanent loss height 70 % catch-up growth generally achieve thyroxine replacement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients clinical biochemical evidence hypothyroidism , T4 le 5.0 ng /dl , fT4 less 1.0 mcg/dl TSH 10 . Patients prolong hypothyroidism growth failure delay bone age least 2 SD mean . Patients short term hypothyroidism normal growth velocity bone age . 2 . Females 8 16 year old . 3 . Males 9 17 year old . 4 . Patients without chronic medical condition . 5 . Availability parent guardian attend study visit patient actively involved patient treatment plan . 6 . Give write informed consent prior study specific screen procedure understand patient right withdraw study time without penalty . 1 . Taking medication affect growth . ( eg . Systemic corticosteroid , anabolic steroid ) 2 . Experiencing health problems/conditions affect growth rate growth hormone deficiency , Cushing Syndrome , rickets , chronic disease . 3 . Patients condition contraindication GH therapy would include condition active tumor , impair glucose tolerance , neurofibromatosis ( worsen neurofibromatosis ) , hypertrophy tonsil adenoid sleep apnea . Contraindications patient GNRHa therapy would include severe systemic reaction GNRHa rare , osteopenia , osteoporosis , delay puberty worsen condition . 4 . Moving location patient able follow pediatric endocrinologist . 5 . Patient willing continue study .</criteria>
