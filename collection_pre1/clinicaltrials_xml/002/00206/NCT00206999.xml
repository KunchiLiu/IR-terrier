	<brief_summary>We want compare relation two different psychophysiological paradigm ( PrePulse Inhibition startle response = PPI P50 suppression ) . Additionally , want test effect combine serotonin- noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor , imipramine , measure . The primary hypothesis PPI P50 gate would correlate baseline . The secondary hypothesis increase noradrenergic serotonergic activity would disrupt PPI well P50 gating .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Schizophrenic patient exhibit impairment filter sensory information , assess use prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) acoustic startle response P50 suppression paradigm . In treatment negative symptom depressive syndrome course schizophrenia antidepressant often combine antipsychotic medication . However , antidepressant increase monoaminergic activity , turn suggest decrease sensory gating , although presumption mostly base result animal study . Currently , little known monoaminergic modulation sensory filtering human , report find literature show discrepancies animal study . The current study design study effect increase monoaminergic activity sensory filter habituation healthy volunteer . In double-blind , placebo control cross-over design , twenty healthy male volunteer receive either placebo dose 50 mg imipramine ( dual act antidepressant ) , test P50 suppression- , PPI- , habituation startle reflex paradigm .</detailed_description>
