	<brief_summary>In study , plan examine difference effect blood glucose control patient either conventional insulin therapy ( i.e . use NPH Humalog twice daily , inject separately ) intensive insulin management ( IIM-several shot short act Glargine insulin ) . Those IIM mix insulin Glargine short-acting insulin analog prior inject . The Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) result use monitor blood glucose control 6 month period . Twice course study , continuous glucose monitor system ( CGMS-a device size pager record blood sugar reading every 5 minute ) use record change blood glucose level occur 72-hour period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The landmark report diabetes control complication trial ( DCCT ) trial show intensive management delay and/or prevents complication small vessel associate Type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) . To achieve goal DCCT , number new insulin analog ( man-made insulin ) incorporate management patient T1DM . These insulin analog gain importance ability overcome major obstacle intensive insulin therapy , namely low blood glucose . In particular , insulin Glargine , consider basal insulin , extensively used management alternative continuous insulin therapy inject tissue skin . The major drawback use insulin Glargine give separate injection mixed insulin . This result undesirable administration multiple insulin injection child diabetes make therapeutic plan complex adhere treatment plan difficult . In previous study , ( accept publication lead diabetes journal , Diabetes Care ) , demonstrate , use continuous glucose monitoring system , significant difference glucose concentration ( ie . high low blood glucose episode ) insulin Glargine administer either mixed short-acting insulin analog give separate injection .</detailed_description>
