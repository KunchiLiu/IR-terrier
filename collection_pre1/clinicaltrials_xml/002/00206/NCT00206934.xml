	<brief_title>The Effects Increased Central Serotonergic Activity Information Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous study point increase serotoninergic activity schizophrenia . Additionally , patient schizophrenia often show reduced filtering sensory information , reflect reduced P50 suppression reduce prepulse inhibition startle refex ( PPI ) . Currently , report literature effect serotonergic agonist sensory gate human inconclusive . In initial study perform laboratory , however , find reduce P50 suppression follow administration imipramine ( combine serotonin- noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor ) healthy volunteer . This result provide evidence involvement either serotonergic , noradrenergic , combination pathway sensory gate . In numerous animal study however , sensory gating reduced agonist 5-HT , suggest serotonergic , rather noradrenergic , involvement sensory gating . Therefore , follow-up study , effect selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( escitalopram ) investigate sensory gate parameter healthy volunteer . To extend data initial study , subject additionally test two psychophysiological parameter attention usually find disturbed patient schizophrenia , i.e . mismatch negativity selective attention . The design double blind , placebo control experiment , single dose escitalopram placebo give healthy , non-smoking male volunteer two occasion , separate least week , subject test psychophysiological test battery .</detailed_description>
