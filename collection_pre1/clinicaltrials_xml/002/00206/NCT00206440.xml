	<brief_title>Nexium Study To Suppress Nausea During Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Breast Cancer The American Cancer Society estimate approximately 215,990 new case breast cancer diagnose woman 2004 United States . Breast cancer common malignancy woman United States second lead cause cancer death woman . Treatment option breast cancer evolve extensive surgical approach breast-conserving technique use adjuvant neo-adjuvant chemotherapy , radiation , endocrine therapy reduce risk recurrence . 2 . Chemotherapy Breast Cancer The use adjuvant chemotherapy well establish routine part care breast cancer . Chemotherapy reduce woman 's risk recurrence 25-30 % . The amount risk reduction depend patient 's age , nodal status , hormone receptor status . Anthracycline-based chemotherapy standard treatment breast cancer doxorubicin frequently use agent group . Currently commonly use chemotherapy regimens breast cancer include : * doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide ( AC ) * fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide ( FAC ) * cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil ( CMF ) * docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide ( TAC ) * fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) * single agent taxanes ( paclitaxel docetaxel ) Except taxanes , agent know cause significant nausea vomit administration . Cancer drug differ quantitatively qualitatively emetogenic potential . Emetogenic potential influence chemotherapy-related characteristic patient characteristic . 3 . Gastrointestinal Side Effects Chemotherapy Nausea vomit follow administration chemotherapy cancer among significant feared side effect patient undergoing treatment . Despite continued advance pharmacology , ability prevent control nausea , vomit , retch remains problem patient . Research confirm chemotherapy relate nausea vomit negatively affect quality life . Among patient , level nausea vomit varies effect quality life . It difficult substantiate degree effect , show even serotonin antagonist , patient still rank nausea bothersome chemotherapy side effect , vomit ranked third fifth bothersome . The risk chemotherapy induce nausea vomit related anti-neoplastic agent administer patient related factor . Emetogenic potential affect intrinsic emetogenicity chemotherapy drug , combination agent , dos administer rate administration . Patient related factor include : 1. gender-increased risk female 2. age-increased risk young , premenopausal patient 3. history alcohol intake-low chronic intake decrease risk 4. history motion sickness-increases risk 5. hyperemesis pregnancy-increases risk . Emesis complex phenomenon characterize three component : nausea , vomit , retch . Nausea subjective phenomenon unpleasant sensation epigastrium back throat may may culminate vomiting ; also describe feel `` sick stomach . '' Nausea exist insofar defined patient . Vomiting forceful expulsion content stomach , duodenum jejunum oral cavity result change intrathoracic positive pressure . It also describe `` throwing . '' Retching , also call `` dry heave , '' attempt vomit without expel material . Drugs use improve control nausea vomit include serotonin antagonist , dopamine antagonist ( metoclopramide , prochlorperazine ) , corticosteroid , benzodiazepine , phenothiazine . The American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) develop clinical practice guideline management chemotherapy-induced nausea vomit base emetogenic potential agent administer . For combination moderate emetogenic potential , acute emesis manage corticosteroid serotonin receptor antagonist . Serotonin receptor antagonist currently available include ondansetron , granisetron , dolasetron . Studies indicate equally effective management chemotherapy-related nausea/vomiting/retching . Delayed emesis ( great 24 hour post-chemotherapy ) control number agent include steroid , serotonin receptor antagonist metoclopramide . Recommended combination include dexamethasone , 8 mg 2-3 day , 4 mg 1-2 day metoclopramide , 20-40 mg twice daily four time daily 3-4 day , Zofran 8 mg twice daily 3 day . With combination chemotherapy , patient receive antiemetic regimen appropriate chemotherapy agent high emetic risk . Drugs use improve control nausea vomit include serotonin antagonist , dopamine antagonist ( metoclopramide , prochlorperazine ) , corticosteroid , benzodiazepine , phenothiazine .

With combination chemotherapy , patient receive antiemetic regimen appropriate chemotherapy agent high emetic risk . Studies do standard antiemetic woman undergo treatment anthracycline-based chemotherapy breast cancer show success rate emetic control range 60-65 % . 4 . Measurement Nausea , Vomiting , Retching It remain difficult compare clinical study nausea vomit variety measurement tool utilized variable time period monitor follow chemotherapy . The ideal tool would include assessment : 1. duration severity nausea 2. frequency , duration , severity vomiting/retching 3. number antiemetic utilized 4. impact nausea vomit quality life 5. adverse effect experience 5 . Proton Pump Inhibitors Despite utilization antiemetic recommend ASCO , approximately one-third patient undergo anthracycline-based chemotherapy still develop nausea vomit . A current therapeutic challenge find prove method control nausea vomit chemotherapy . Although pathophysiology nausea vomit well understood , know chemotherapy cause damage gastrointestinal ( GI ) mucosa . The pathobiology mucosal damage review Blijlevens divide four phase : inflammatory phase , epithelial phase , ulcerative/bacteriological phase heal phase . This mucosal injury usually self-limiting complete cycle injury heal last approximately 2-3 week . The mucosal damage increase patient receive chemotherapy corticosteroid breast cancer patient require pre-medications . Since cytotoxic chemotherapy damage mucosal line , leave GI mucosa expose normal acid-producing gastric parietal cell . The resultant damage see endoscopically patient receive chemotherapy cytosine arabinoside . Hence , suppression acid secretion gastric parietal cell reduce mucosal injury relate symptom . Historical therapy gastrointestinal distress include anticholinergic , well H-2 receptor antagonist , help reduce acid secretion . H-2 receptor blocker effective block histamine drive acid secretion , despite target action , acid production continue alternative pathway . Recently group new agent know proton pump inhibitor develop target final common pathway acid secretion . These agent know act directly H+/K+-ATPase gastric parietal cell . Since agent act directly final stimulatory pathway , provide rapid symptom resolution reliable heal gastroesophageal reflux disease peptic ulcer disease . To date , two large clinical trial perform evaluate effectiveness proton pump inhibitor prevent mucosal injury . The first trial select 182 patient breast cancer ( 77 pt ) colon cancer ( 105 pt ) receive cyclophosphamide , methotrexate 5-FU ( CMF ) , 5-FU , respectively . These patient randomize receive either omeprazole ( 20 mg daily ) , misoprostol ( prostaglandin analogue ) ( 400 mg twice daily ) , placebo ( daily ) two full course chemotherapy ( 56 day ) . Endoscopic evaluation ( EGD ) perform one week prior initiation chemotherapy one week end second cycle chemotherapy compare number erosions/ulcers stomach duodenum . The omeprazole group lower frequency degree erosion compare placebo misoprostol . Symptoms epigastric pain heartburn also significantly less omeprazole patient . A second study perform group evaluate patient breast colon cancer ( n=228 ) receive either CMF 5-FU . These patient randomize receive omeprazole 20 mg daily , ranitidine 300 mg daily ( H2 blocker ) , placebo daily 56 day . EGD perform , cycle 1 cycle 2 chemotherapy . The omeprazole group experience low frequency ulcer ( n=2 ) , follow ranitidine group ( n=8 ) , placebo group ( n=18 ) . Symptoms epigastric pain heartburn also significantly less omeprazole arm ( n=11 ) compare ranitidine ( n=13 ) placebo ( n=24 ) arm . Chemotherapy delay placebo ranitidine group , patient receive omeprazole . These two trial demonstrate ability proton pump inhibitor ( omeprazole ) limit mucosal injury induce chemotherapy . Protecting mucosa damage also appear significantly decrease frequency upper GI symptom . It note nausea vomit assess either trial since various antiemetic give chemotherapy . Esomeprazole magnesium late proton pump inhibitor develop . It unique S- isomer omeprazole , , good bioavailability elevate level compare racemic omeprazole . Since proton pump last step acid production , blockade pump cause reduction gastric acidity . This effect dose relate dose 20-40mg daily . Esomeprazole currently clinically indicate treatment erosive esophagitis symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease . In addition , approve treat Helicobacter pylorus patient duodenal ulcer disease conjunction either amoxicillin clarithromycin amoxicillin .</detailed_description>
