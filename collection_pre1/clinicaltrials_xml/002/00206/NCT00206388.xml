	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To find high dose monthly intravenous Zometa give daily low dos cyclophosphamide mouth child recurrent refractory neuroblastoma without cause severe side effect . 2 . To find side effect see give Zometa cyclophosphamide schedule different dose level . 3 . To measure blood urine level Zometa treatment 4 . To preliminarily evaluate antitumor activity Zometa concomitant oral cyclophosphamide child recurrent and/or refractory neuroblastoma within confines Phase I study . 5 . To measure effect Zometa marker bone breakdown found urine , blood , bone marrow 6 . To measure effect Zometa immune system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronic Acid ( ZOMETA ) With Cyclophosphamide With Neuroblastoma Cortical Bone Involvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Zoledronic Acid ( Zometa ) , new generation , highly potent bisphosphonate use treat osteoporosis hypercalcemia malignancy , widely use adult malignancy potential bone metastasis breast cancer , multiple myeloma prostate cancer . Bisphosphonates modulate bone environment toxicity osteoclasts result decrease bone resorption . Zometa first bisphosphonate affect osteolytic osteoblastic metastatic lesion . In several large randomize study adults recurrent advanced malignancy , patient randomize Zometa delay progression bone metastases less morbidity ( skeletal relate event ) compare either placebo pamidronate . The toxicity profile Zometa adult tolerable include hypocalcemia , temperature rise , nausea . The concern toxicity decline renal function appear related cumulative dose dose rate administration . In pre-clinical study bisphosphonates delayed progression osteolytic lesion neuroblastoma tumor xenografted immunocompromised mouse combination Zometa low dose cyclophosphamide appear prolong overall survival . The primary aim study evaluate maximum tolerate dose Zometa combine low dose oral cyclophosphamide child recurrent refractory neuroblastoma . We also evaluate pharmacokinetics Zometa child neuroblastoma examine effect Zometa marker bone resorption , cytokine bone-related growth factor .</detailed_description>
