	<brief_title>Anti-Estrogens - A Potential Treatment Bipolar Affective Disorder Women ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Bipolar Affective Disorder remain illness high morbidity mortality . Mood stabilizer lithium sodium valproate describe anti-manic effect target protein kinase C ( PKC ) isozymes ( Manji Lenos , 1999 ) . In rat chronically treat lithium , reduction major PKC substrate MARCKS reduction hippocampus expression two protein kinase isozymes , alpha epsilon . Manji et al . ( 1999 ) postulate PKC inhibitor tamoxifen estrogen antagonist might represent novel class therapeutic agent treatment mania . Clinical support use `` anti-estrogens '' treat mania find case report Nelson ( 1998 ) , Goldstein ( 1986 ) , describe use danazol case mania , Chouinard et al ( 1987 ) describe use estrogen progesterone case mania . A recent preliminary trial Bebchuk et al , ( 2000 ) , demonstrate adjunctive tamoxifen improve manic symptom seven patient . A limitation trial fail standardise treatment agent use , include lithium , antidepressant , anxiolytic anti-psychotic medication . Mania woman also note cyclic variation , poorly document largely anecdotal . This need study , since preponderance affective disorder woman , propose conduct study woman active symptom mania . OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To test compare use two adjunctive hormonal agent 28 day three-arm double-blind , placebo-controlled study treatment acute mania hypomania . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To examine impact hormonal treatment PKC pathway woman mania . To document observed cyclical variation presentation mania hypomania woman bipolar affective disorder schizoaffective disorder . ETHICS REVIEW AND INFORMED CONSENT ETHICS APPROVAL The protocol study approve Southern Health Multidisciplinary Ethics Committee The Alfred Ethics Committee . INFORMED CONSENT Only patient able give inform consent , ( ie . Able demonstrate understand objective study implication role ) , recruit study . Patients extremely psychotic disturbed approach enter study . Involuntary patient able give inform consent able participate possible guardian relative contact notified patient 's involvement . Patients advised participation voluntary free withdraw study stage CONFIDENTIALITY Once patient agrees participate study , assign code number ensure anonymity . All file identify patient code number . Patient 's file store locked filing cabinet access available researcher . Information patient restrict researcher directly involve patient 's treating doctor . STUDY POPULATION NUMBERS A target number 60 patient recruit 3 year . Patients recruit inpatient outpatient setting . WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA - Patients free withdraw study stage without offer explanation . - Patients experience adverse effect , opinion investigator , serious ( i.e . life threatening , require hospitalisation medical treatment ) withdrawn study immediately . All patient withdraw followed adverse event resolve . STUDY TREATMENTS CONCOMITANT TREATMENTS All patient participate standard in-patient outpatient psychosocial therapy activity advise treatment team . All patient receive psychotropic non-psychotropic medication per treatment team order . All medication receive study record include analysis . STUDY MEDICATION Tamoxifen . One third patient randomise receive adjunctive Tamoxifen 40mg/day 28 day . The Tamoxifen administer within plain capsule maintain `` blind '' treatment arm . Progesterone . One third patient randomise receive adjunctive Provera ( progesterone ) 20mg/day . The Progesterone administer within plain capsule identical use Tamoxifen . Placebo . The remain one third patient randomise receive adjunctive placebo ( inert substance ) . The placebo substance administer within plain capsule identical use Tamoxifen Progesterone . MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS Medication side effect minimise study short duration trial ( 28 day ) , dose level use , careful monitoring side effect visit . Possible side effect Tamoxifen include ; hot flush , nausea , liver enzyme change , fluid retention , spot , change blood clot profile , light-headedness . Possible side effect progesterone ( medroxyprogesterone acetate ) include ; nausea , breast tenderness , change liver enzymes , blood clot profile change , acne light-headedness.Patients withdraw consent time study . STUDY EVALUATIONS STRUCTURED CLINICAL INTERVIEW FOR DSM-IV ( SCID ) The structured clinical interview DSM-III-R ( SCID-R Spitzer et al . 1990 see appendix D ) use confirm diagnosis patient enter study . This perform treat doctor prior randomisation . It consist structure interview doctor ask set question regard symptom rate reply three point scale 1 = absent false 3 = threshold true . CLINICIAN ADMINISTERED RATING SCALE FOR MANIA ( CARS - M ) The CARS-M scale devise specifically measure symptom Mania associate BPAD . It administer structured clinical interview . The scale comprise 15 item assess severity manic psychotic symptomatology . POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOM SCHEDULE ( PANSS ) The PANSS ( Kay et al . 1987 ) perform screening/baseline evaluation visit . The PANSS consist Positive Scale ( 7 positive symptom construct ) , Negative Scale ( 7 negative symptom construct ) General Psychopathology Scale ( 16 symptom construct ) . For patient , scale administer rater time day . MONTGOMERY ASBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE ( MADRS ) The MADRS ten item rating scale rating level depression . Each item rat 7-point scale 0 6 , 0 indicates absence symptom 6 indicates extreme presence symptom . The time frame scale previous four week . ABNORMAL INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENT SCALE ( AIMS ) The AIMS complete screening/baseline evaluation visit . The scale consist 10 item , rat 4-point scale severity . SIMPSON-ANGUS SCALE ( SAS ) The SAS complete screening/baseline evaluation visit . This scale consist list 10 symptom , rat 5-point scale severity . BARNES AKATHISIA RATING SCALE The presence severity akathisia evaluate baseline follow-up visit Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale . The scale consist four item ( objective observation akathisia investigator , subjective feeling restlessness patient , patient distress due akathisia , global evaluation akathisia ) . MENSTRUAL CYCLE INTERVIEW To collect information patient 's menstrual history well current menstrual status , Menstrual Cycle Interview administer pre-menopausal patient . This interview consist 13 question related patient menstrual cycle associate issue . The questionnaire use conjunction serum hormone level determine menstrual cycle phase . The questionnaire administer baseline conclusion trial . Patients also ask keep menstrual calendar register onset cessation menstruation . LABORATORY TESTS A blood sample collect baseline visit measure : 1 . Serum mood stabiliser level . 2 . PKC activity , use 32P-labelled phosphate transfer technique platelet . To analysed site Mental Health Research Institute . 3 . Hormone assay estrogen , progesterone , luteinising hormone , follicle stimulate hormone prolactin . These level give indication anti-estrogen activity . REPEATABLE BATTERY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS ( RBANS ) To evaluate cognitive function RBANS administer baseline conclusion trial . The RBANS comprise 12 subtests use calculate five index score ( Immediate Memory ; Visuospatial/Constructional ; Language ; Attention ; , Delayed Memory ) total score . SAFETY ASPECTS ADVERSE EVENTS All adverse event record investigator visit . Any adverse event occur course study follow patient completes study time adverse event resolve . SCHEDULE OF PATIENT VISITS SCREENING Patients screen soon admission possible . After patient deem eligible enter study , inform consent obtain . No study procedure implement prior attainment inform consent . Where possible , baseline visit complete time screen visit . EVALUATION VISITS A total five evaluation visit perform baseline , week 1 , 2 , 3 &amp; 4 . All visit perform +/- 2 day schedule visit date . At evaluation visit researcher check record adverse event , perform psychopathology rating scale , collect blood sample hormone assay . Participants reimburse $ 20 per visit cover cost travel . STUDY MANAGEMENT DATA RECORDING All data gather entered patient file patient code number . Files store research unit lock filing cabinet . Data enter computer do use patient code number identification . A separate booklet use record data collect screening , baseline , evaluation visit . All file retain hospital period 15 year completion discontinuation trial .</detailed_description>
