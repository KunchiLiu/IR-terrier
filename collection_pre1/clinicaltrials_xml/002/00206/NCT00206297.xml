	<detailed_description>The Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) show improve blood sugar control individual Type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) stop delay onset long-term complication . As result study , intensive insulin management aim control blood sugar glycosylated hemoglobin ( 3 month blood glucose average test ) near normal safely possible . However , hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) increase three fold DCCT study major limit factor gain `` tight '' control blood sugar T1DM . In healthy individual , `` meal '' blood sugar level carefully control . Insulin ( hormone lower blood sugar ) glucagon ( hormone raise blood sugar ) play key role maintain careful balance . In T1DM , lack insulin failure glucagon suppression ( keep glucagon make much ) . This lead hyperglycemia ( high blood sugar ) right eat food . Also , glucagon control correctly meal . The glucagon , normally produce body , increase person T1DM low blood sugar . This interfere balance much glucose make much glucose use . Therefore , glucagon fails protect low blood sugar people T1DM . This make difficult normal blood sugar someone T1DM . This imbalance may due another hormone call amylin . This hormone may low people T1DM . Amylin produce pancreas ( part body make insulin ) cell produce insulin also lack person T1DM . Amylin work lower glucagon meal . This keep liver letting store sugar blood stream right eat . Pramlintide man-made amylin give subcutaneous shot ( skin ) similar insulin . At present , pramlintide receive FDA approval . Studies perform adult show add amylin T1DM , use pramlintide , lower high level glucagon make meal . This result improve `` meal '' high blood sugar overall blood sugar control . Currently , pramlintide adult give separate injection insulin , meal , three time day . When give bolus shot ( one dose shot give ) child young adult , seem cause immediate low blood sugar meal . The low blood sugar may cause `` slow '' food digestion pramlintide . Another possible cause low blood sugar may way pramlintide give ( bolus shot versus dual wave infusion ) .</detailed_description>
