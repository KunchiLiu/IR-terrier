	<brief_summary>We , investigator Baylor Breast Care Cancer , study learn well Taxotere make tumor become small . We also study find well Taxotere treat type breast cancer patient . We ask patient take part study locally advance breast cancer . Women breast cancer usually receive chemotherapy medicine reduce shrink cancer surgery take cancer . If patient choose take part study , receive Taxotere combination cyclophosphamide doxorubicin . These medicine part standard good medical care type breast cancer . They approve treatment problem . To help u learn patient ' cancer respond medicine , take small tissue sample ( biopsy ) patient ' breast cancer begin treatment , one day first dose treatment , week first three week treatment , surgery do part treatment cancer . These sample collect also look biology patient ' cancer . We also use new method call cDNA array technology , let u look thousand gene ( cod information inside cancer cell ) . By look different gene breast cancer , may learn important information cancer respond chemotherapy medicine . We hope learn different gene pattern patient whose tumor shrink shrink chemotherapy medicine . This information may help u , future , choose right medicine woman breast cancer high chance cancer shrink chemotherapy medicine . We know patient benefit take part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extension Neoadjuvant Taxotere : Study Effects Taxotere Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New treatment strategy need improve clinical outcome breast cancer patient high risk tumor recurrence . Even best present combination chemotherapy , radiotherapy surgery , five-year rate disease recurrence death least 60 % patient locally advance breast cancer . Recent advance may improve clinical outcome include use taxanes ( paclitaxel docetaxel ) , new class cytotoxic agent , report high response rate standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy . Understanding vivo mechanism action chemotherapeutic agent would also allow rational combination agent . For example , apoptosis main mechanism therapeutic action , future development restore function p53 gene therapy treatment apoptosis regulate molecule may prove important future advance treatment cancer . If specific therapeutic target pathway identify , new molecule selective action target may develop , may potential decreased toxicity increase efficacy . To end , undertook Phase II clinical trial neoadjuvant docetaxel ( Taxotere ) patient locally advance breast cancer ( H-8448 ) , primary goal define clinical efficacy biologic effect docetaxel . The secondary aim study identify distinctive gene expression pattern predictive response docetaxel chemotherapy . For , propose use microarray expression technology ( Affymetrix U95A ) ally validation technology ( e.g. , IHC , western blot , quantitative RT-PCR ) identify validate pattern gene expression associate chemotherapy sensitivity resistance . The purpose Phase II extension study determine biologic effect docetaxel ( Taxotere ) , identify gene expression profile predictive response , describe efficacy Taxotere woman locally advance breast cancer . In addition surgical operability clinical response , endpoint include comparison histologic molecular marker sequential core biopsy primary breast cancer patient receive Taxotere . Expression array use identify validate pattern gene expression associate Taxotere sensitivity resistance . Clinical study : A diagnostic core biopsy perform prestudy , tissue obtain available analysis . Other required baseline investigation , include CBC , kidney function test , liver function test , EKG , pregnancy test , part standard care . Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) 100 mg/m2 administer day 1 . A core biopsy perform one day chemotherapy ( day 2 ) day 8 , 15 22 . On day 22 , repeat core biopsy , second cycle docetaxel ( Taxotere ) chemotherapy ( 100 mg/m2 ) give . Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) give three-weekly total four cycle . Primary surgery conduct , operable , follow completion neoadjuvant treatment . Adjuvant AC ( doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 , every three week ) four cycle administer . Adjuvant radiotherapy consider follow completion AC chemotherapy . Patients whose tumor ER and/or PgR positive would commence tamoxifen five year completion AC chemotherapy . Core biopsy : Core biopsy biologic marker evaluation perform prestudy ( excess diagnostic biopsy ) , day 2 , 8 , 15 , 22 follow entry study . Tissue analysis also obtain surgery . Prestudy biopsy specimen surgery part standard care , four additional biopsy perform solely research purpose . Thus , total six biopsy obtain : prestudy , day 2 , day 8 , day 15 , day 22 , surgery . Biologic marker assess : Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) may produce therapeutic response induction program cell death inhibition cell division . Hence , apoptosis TUNEL assay regulatory molecule ( p53 , bcl-2 bax ) measure . Proliferation assess measure Ki67 . From animal model , antiangiogenic effect docetaxel ( Taxotere ) describe , would assess clinical sample measure VEGF microvessel counting ( CD31 ) . Remaining frozen tissue snap frozen store temporarily liquid nitrogen microarray analysis . Side effect chemotherapy part standard care . The chemotherapy treatment use protocol widely use breast cancer patient represent effective treatment condition . Some known effect chemotherapy include neutropenia , infection , anemia , cardiotoxicity , congestive heart failure , alopecia , nail discoloration , nausea , vomit , fatigue , loss appetite . Side effect core biopsy : Risks associate breast biopsy include bleeding , bruising , mild discomfort , infection . Discomfort minor complication four additional biopsy procedure minimize use experienced personnel .</detailed_description>
