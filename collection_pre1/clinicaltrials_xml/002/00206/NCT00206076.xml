	<brief_title>Mycophenolate Mofetil Immunosuppression Without/With Reduced Dose Calcineurin Inhibitor Long After Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most liver transplant recipient receive immunosuppressive drug regimen contain either cyclosporine tacrolimus . Although drug revolutionize transplantation , many patient long-term use major cause serious side effect , include kidney failure , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , and/or neurologic side effect . Stopping reduce dose cyclosporine tacrolimus ameliorate side effect may increase risk rejection . Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , safe effective immunosuppressant cause side effect , typically use combination cyclosporine tacrolimus . Attempts liver transplant recipient use mycophenolate mofetil alone reduce dose cyclosporine tacrolimus successful patient developed rejection , patient suffer liver failure . Most rejection liver transplantation easy successfully treat increased immunosuppression , treatment may carry risk increased susceptibility infection . There yet large trial adequately assess safety efficacy use mycophenolate mofetil way ( alone reduce dose calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) ) . The purpose trial evaluate whether mycophenolate mofetil monotherapy reduce dose cyclosporine tacrolimus long-term liver transplantation safe decrease side effect relate calcineurin inhibitor use . Only liver recipient expect relatively low risk develop rejection and/or liver failure eligible trial . Some reason consider low risk stable liver function , transplant year , one few prior rejection episode , non-autoimmune liver disease , currently require low dose/level cyclosporine tacrolimus , plan use high dose mycophenolate mofetil exclude patient fail attain target value mycophenolic acid area concentration-time curve ( MPA AUC - MycoPhenolic Acid Area Under Curve ) . Eligible patient randomize receive either mycophenolate mofetil monotherapy ( MMF ; CNI discontinue ) , mycophenolate mofetil half baseline dose calcineurin inhibitor ( MMF ; CNI decrease ) . The primary outcome biopsy proven rejection secondary outcome include patient graft survival , adverse event , hepatic profile , blood pressure , renal function , diabetes , lipid profile . Additionally , mycophenolic acid concentration measure ; mycophenolate mofetil monotherapy trial provide unique opportunity study implication monitoring . Patients follow 12 month ; 16 visit trial .</detailed_description>
