	<brief_title>Taxotere Adriamycin/Cytoxan ( AC ) Validation Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Large clinical trial confirm value systemic adjuvant therapy decrease risk recurrence death patient early breast cancer . However , need identify breast cancer patient benefit adjuvant therapy , spar others side effect futile treatment , spur research predictive marker chemotherapy sensitivity resistance . In adjuvant setting , extremely large trial long follow-up would require prospectively validate predictive value biomarkers chemotherapy sensitivity resistance . In part response directly observable . Preoperative chemotherapy large tumor ( &gt; 3cm ) inoperable breast cancer well establish standard care locally advance breast cancer . Data large series patient demonstrate preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy lead significant reduction tumor size ( downstaging ) improve rate cosmetic result breast- conserve surgery . The degree response neoadjuvant therapy show predict improve overall survival . This therefore attractive setting study predictor response tissue accessible pre- therapeutic biopsy tumor response directly observable . In early proof-of-principle pilot study single agent neoadjuvant docetaxol , identify predictive gene expression pattern , , use leave-one-cross validation , method internal validation , demonstrate pattern likely accurately discriminate responder non-responders ( Chang , J.C. , et al. , Gene expression profile prediction therapeutic response docetaxel patient breast cancer . Lancet , 2003 . 362 ( 9381 ) : p. 362-9 ) . A similar pilot study neoadjuvant AC undertaken collaborator UK suggest different profile predictive AC response . In order definitively determine predictive pattern regimen ( T AC ) use improve technology RNA preparation large , comprehensive gene expression array , undertook randomize Phase II trial two widely use regimen ( Protocol H-11624 - A RANDOMIZED MULTICENTER TRIAL OF NEOADJUVANT TAXOTERE AND ADRIAMYCIN/CYTOXAN ( AC ) : A BIOLOGIC CORRELATIVE STUDY ) . The trial near completion , recruit 90 patient expect 120 patient . To date , risk associate study modest , unexpected adverse event . The laboratory work well underway give every indication clinically useful classifier predict treatment efficacy result .</detailed_description>
