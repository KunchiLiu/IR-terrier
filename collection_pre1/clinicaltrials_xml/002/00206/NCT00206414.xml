	<brief_title>Arimidex/Faslodex/Iressa Study : A Trial Using Arimidex , Faslodex Iressa Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last three decade , steady shift occur management breast cancer . Because traditionally view local disease , many advocate use radical surgery achieve maximum survival benefit . This view slowly replace broad biologic view recognizes often systemic nature breast cancer , even appear localized breast . Results randomize clinical trial demonstrate less extensive surgery lumpectomy plus radiation therapy optimal local management early breast cancer . In addition le radical approach surgical treatment breast cancer , randomize clinical trial establish value postoperative ( adjuvant ) systemic therapy improve overall survival eradicate micrometastatic disease , major cause mortality breast cancer . An improved survival show use chemotherapy well antiestrogen tamoxifen adjuvant setting confirm overview analysis Early Breast Cancer Trialist Collaborative Group . Despite well-documented benefit adjuvant systemic therapy , effective prevent death breast cancer patient candidate treatment . The worth therapy judge retrospect upon disease relapse , time breast cancer nearly always incurable . Currently , reliable method predict success failure particular postoperative treatment modality well way predict optimize outcome need . Preoperative ( primary , neoadjuvant ) systemic therapy alternative approach base strong rationale . With tumor still place directly accessible , form therapy allow direct observation response treatment may predict likelihood control distant micrometastatic disease also enable sample tissue explore molecular correlate response also mechanisms action therapeutic agent . Furthermore , allow early identification patient refractory disease might benefit alternative treatment develop macrometastatic disease miss opportunity cure . Primary systemic therapy also help facilitate surgery debulking disease patient initially inoperable tumor , well improve odds breast conservation . A pivotal trial establish role preoperative systemic therapy NSABP trial B-187 . In trial , woman localize breast cancer randomize receive Adriamycin , Cytoxan ( AC ) either preoperatively postoperatively . There difference two group disease-free overall survival . Furthermore , quantify tumor response preoperatively allow prediction patient outcome term disease-free overall survival . Specifically , patient achieve pathologic complete response , i.e. , complete disappearance invasive cancer pathologic examination , best outcome , establish role response valid surrogate predictor sensitivity distant micrometastatic disease chemotherapy subsequent clinical outcome . In addition , breast-conserving surgery frequently perform preoperative treatment group , advantage postoperative treatment approach . Most importantly , however , NSABP trial B-18 show conclusively primary systemic therapy safe place patient disadvantage delay primary surgical treatment . Another large , multicenter prospective trial conduct European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) confirm finding NSABP trial B-18 . Primary study objective : - To determine clinical response rate primary breast cancer combination Arimidex , Faslodex , Iressa Secondary study objective : - To study molecular change response treatment - To determine pathologic response rate - To assess tolerability safety combination regimen</detailed_description>

WHO performance status 3 4 8 . As judged investigator , uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , significant cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 9 . Evidence significant clinical disorder laboratory find make undesirable subject participate clinical trial . 10 . Concomitant use phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampicin , barbiturate , St. John 's wort 11 . Concurrent treatment estrogens progestin . Patients must stop drug least two week prior study entry . 12 . Treatment nonapproved investigational drug within 30 day Day 1 study treatment 13 . Platelet count less 75,000 14 . In opinion investigator , bleed diathesis anticoagulation therapy would preclude intramuscular injection . 15 . History hypersensitivity castor oil 16 . Any evidence clinically active interstitial lung disease ( patient chronic stable radiographic change asymptomatic need exclude ) . 17 . Patients recurrent breast cancer . Patients contralateral second primary breast cancer eligible .</criteria>
