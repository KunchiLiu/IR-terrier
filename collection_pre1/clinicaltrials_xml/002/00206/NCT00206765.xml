	<brief_title>Risperidone vs. Paroxetine Panic Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Risperidone atypical antipsychotic drug act antagonist 5-HT2A/2C D2 receptor ( Chouignard et al , 1993 ; Marder &amp; Meibach , 1994 ) . In serotonergic activity , risperidone resembles atypical antidepressant 5HT2-antagonist nefazodone ( Bakish et al , 1993 ) 5HT2-antagonist ritanserine ( Lima &amp; Moncrieff , 2000 ; Preskorn 1995 ) . Nefazodone treat anxiety symptom induces le agitation reuptake blocker ( Fawcett et al , 1995 ) ritanserin show effectiveness treatment dysthymia clinical trial . Moreover , risperidone increase release dopamine norepinephrine prefrontal cortex ( Zhang et al , 2000 ) , activity pharmacological agent associate antidepressant , anxiolytic , antipanic property ( Thase , 2002 ) . Therefore , risperidone potential effective treatment either Generalized Anxiety Disorder , Panic Disorder , Major Depressive Disorder Panic Attacks ( DSM-IV , 1994 ) single agent . Moreover , due D2 5-HT2A/2C antagonism prove antipsychotic efficacy , drug could uniquely effective severe panic attack psychotic feature para-psychotic feature ( Galynker et al , 1996 ) . Consistent supposition , Marder et al ( 1997 ) report patient schizophrenia , risperidone produce significantly great improvement haloperidol PANSS score measure anxiety depression . Our clinical experience 50 patient panic attack show low dose risperidone , similar lorazepam , reduce eliminate anxiety panic , often first dose . Risperidone effective patient experience obsessive , intrusive , anxiety-inducing thought . In contrast lorazepam , risperidone treatment result build tolerance drug disinhibition . We observe extrapyramidal side effect patient treat risperidone panic attack . Thus , preliminary clinical data indicate due efficacy , quick onset action , absence addictive potential , lack side effect , risperidone could superior benzodiazepine SSRIs treatment panic attack , particularly severe panic attack . Moreover , risperidone potential first line drug treatment symptom . Consequently , present , clinical study risperidone treatment panic attack indicate great potential value . We therefore propose exploratory open label single-blind trial risperidone vs. paroxetine treatment panic attack . Hypothesis/Objectives Objective One . To compare efficacy risperidone paroxetine treatment panic attack patient Panic Disorder Major Depressive Disorder Panic attack . Hypothesis One : Risperidone efficacious treatment panic symptom patient group . Some patient improve within 24 hr . Objective Two . To compare side effect profile risperidone vs. paroxetine treatment panic attack . Hypothesis Two : Risperidone , compare paroxetine , cause le sexual side effect , anxiety , restlessness . There difference extrapyramidal side effect paroxetine risperidone group . Objective Three . To compare response rate risperidone vs. paroxetine treatment panic attack . Hypothesis Three : Patients panic attack respond significantly faster risperidone paroxetine . Objective Four . To examine demographic clinical predictor robust response risperidone treatment use appropriate statistical analysis individual scale item treatment response rate . Hypothesis Four : The subgroup patient panic attack high score item reflect somatic anxiety , ruminative intrusive thinking , nocturnal panic attack show good response risperidone therapy patient low score item . If study hypothesis confirm , future research could include randomize , double blind fix dose study risperidone sole agent treatment panic disorder Phase IV trial aim determine effectiveness 0.125 mg 0.0675 mg dose risperidone treatment anxiety panic attack . Study Population The patient population consist psychiatric outpatient meet criterion DSM-IV diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder Panic Attacks Panic Disorder . The subject recruit Center Treatment Affective Disorders Anxiety Trauma Center Department Psychiatry Beth Israel Medical center provide care 900 patient . At present , patient ethnic racial mix 50 % Hispanic , 15 % African American , 32.5 % Caucasian 2.5 % Asian . The gender distribution approximately 33 % male 67 % female . The outpatient payer mix 20 % Medicare , 74 % Medicaid 6 % combine . Of patient , approximately 40 % ( 360 ) manifest panic attack . Based previous experience recruitment research study , expect 10-12 % patient ( 36-42 ) meeting diagnostic criterion also meet inclusion exclusion criterion , sign inform consent participate study . We expect recruit 40 patient per year complete study 3 year . Inclusion Criteria 1 . Males female , age 21-55 . 2 . Ability sign inform consent 3 . Diagnosis Panic Disorder , MDD Panic attack , single episode , recurrent , chronic 4 . HAM-A score &gt; 17 Exclusion Criteria 1 . Alcohol substance abuse within last 6 month 2 . Current diagnosis Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 3 . Current diagnosis Schizophrenia , Schizoaffective Disorder , Bipolar Mood Disorder 4 . Use antipsychotic medication two month precede enrollment study 5 . Changes antidepressant mood stabilizer dose two month precede enrollment study 6 . Previous adverse reaction risperidone paroxetine . Study Design Drug Regimens The study 8-week parallel comparison ( blinded rater ) risperidone paroxetine treatment three group patient panic attack . Each group consist 30 subject . After sign informed consent , subject randomly assign open manner treatment risperidone paroxetine alone . Arm 1 : Treatment risperidone flexible-dose initiated 0.25 mg po qhs . For subject achieve remission panic symptom , dose increase 0.5 mg po qhs day 3 . For subject experienced morning sedation , dose decrease 0.125-mg po qhs day 3 . Arm 2 : Treatment Paroxetine flexible-dose initiate 10-mg po qhs . For subject experienced morning sedation , dose decrease 5-mg po qhs day 3 . For subject achieve remission panic symptom , dose increase 20-mg po qhs . For subject achieve remission panic symptom , dose increase 40-mg po qhs need . Arm 3 : Treatment Paroxetine fix dose schedule initiate 10 mg po qhs day 1 . On day 3 increase 20 mg po qhs . On day 7 increase 30 mg po qhs . Most patient respond average therapeutic dose 30 mg paroxetine.. This ensure subgroup subject receive optimum therapeutic dose Paroxetine also aid titrate Paroxetine equivalent dose Risperidone . Patients randomized arm , respond side effect take study refer regular psychiatric treatment . The subject receive fix dose antidepressant mood stabilizer prior enrollment study continue medication throughout study . No dose adjustment antidepressant mood stabilizer allow . At end study , participant choose continue study medication care one study physicians one psychiatrists Psychiatric outpatient service adult Beth Israel Medical Center 16 Street First Avenue , 2 Bernstein . Those wish stop study medication end study able supervision one study physician . Paroxetine tapered two-week period avoid SSRI withdrawal . Risperidone stop abruptly since withdrawal symptom report literature make risperidone taper unnecessary . Assessments evaluate mood improvement perform rater blind medication status daily basis first three day every day first two week . The assessment ( please see Appendix 1 assessment battery ) continue weekly rest study . All study participant ' provide psychiatric treatment , free charge , clinic , one month follow end study . At end one-month period , assist find psychiatric care . Travel expense reimburse subject participate study . Data Analysis We calculate Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficient ( r ) treatment outcome variable group . This enable u determine degree association treatment outcome . More importantly , interpret ( r ) Binomial Effect Size Display ( BESD ) ( Rosenthal , 1991 ) . The BESD enable u estimate clinically meaningful improvement rate estimate number people would improve result treatment . Power Analysis Precision Analysis As state , measure effect size Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficient ( r ) . For study chose effect size r = .50 small effect size would clinically meaningful , calculate would need sample size 26 , obtain power 81 % , 95.0 % confidence interval ( r = .13 r = .75 ) would include zero . ( Rosenthal , 1991 ) .</detailed_description>
