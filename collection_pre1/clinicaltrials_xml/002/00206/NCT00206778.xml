	<brief_title>Six Month Trial Lamotrigine v . Sodium Valproate Treatment Mixed Mania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mixed mania clinically distinct affective state likely severe classical euphoric mania longer episode duration . Mixed mania associate long duration illness , suicidality , poor outcome ( McElroy et al , 1995 ) . Although present universally agree definition mixed state , 40-60 % patient acute manic state also meet criterion either major depression dysphoria ( Dilsaver et al,1999 ; Calabrese et al , 1999 ; Secunda et al,1985 ; Sporn Sacks,1997 ) . Dilsaver al ( 1999 ) factor analytic study manic symptom able differentiate dysphoric depress mania . Patients depress mania ( 30 % patient mania ) manic patient euphoric mania also meet criterion Major depressive disorder . Patients dysphoric mania less manic less depressed , irritable depressed euphoric manic patient . At present accepted treatment algorithm mixed affective state include depressed dysphoric mania Dilsaver definition . Currently use antimanic agent ( lorazepam , typical antipsychotic , olanzapine ) mood stablizers ( lithium , divlaproex sodium ) little antidepressant activity . Therefore , treatment mixed mania frequently result emergence bipolar depression often treatment-refractory . Thus urgent need effective treatment mixed mania result bipolar depression . Lamotrigine anticonvulsant prolongs refractory phase voltage sensitive channel , action associate antimanic property ( Hurly , 2002 ; Sporn Sacks , 1997 ; Calabrese et al ; 1999 , Normann et al ; 2002 ) . Lamotrigine postulate decrease glutamate release act voltage-sensitive sodium channel refractory phase , stabilize presynaptic neuronal membrane inhibit pathologic release glutamate . As abnormality glutamatergic system implicate depression , NMDA receptor antagonist reverse anxiety depression various stress model , lamotrigine could act antidepressant . . Thus , lamotrigine potential antimanic antidepressant activity ( ref , see Sporn Sacks , 1997 ) , theory uniquely effective mixed mania ( Dilsaver et al , 1999 ) . Indeed , clinical trial review detail Hurley ( 2002 ) , demonstrate lamotrigine somewhat effective antimanic agent , significant antidepressant activity bipolar depression . Lamotrigine use combination agent monotherapy , response rate depress , mixed rapid cycle state similar , range 52 % 63 % . With slow dose titration ( 6 week ) , side effect incidence exfoliative dermatitis 1 500 . Of note , although Sporn Sachs ( 1997 ) report switch depression rapid cycling , incidence . In institution , lamotrigine effective treatment mixed mania bipolar depression patient receive standard maintenance treatment Bipolar Mood Disorder . Lamotrigine worsen agitation two elderly patient symptom irritable mania . Based evidence , appear lamotrigine , either combination proven antimanic agent monotherapy , uniquely suit agent choice treatment mixed mania . Therefore , propose randomize open-label trial lamotrigine vs. standard care sodium valpoate treatment mixed mania . Within framework , follow study 's hypothesis objective : Hypothesis/Objectives Objective One . To compare efficacy lamotrigine sodium valproate ( standard care ) treatment depressive symptom acute mania patient Bipolar Mood Disorder . Hypothesis One : Lamotrigine effective sodium valproate treatment depressive symptom acute mixed mania . Objective Two . To compare efficacy lamotrigine sodium valproate treatment manic symptom acute mixed mania . Hypothesis Two : Lamotrigine sodium valproate equally effective treatment manic symptom acute mixed mania measure Young Mania Rating Scale score . Objective Three . To compare efficacy lamotrigine sodium valproate maintenance treatment patient bipolar mood disorder recent past episode mixed mania . Hypothesis Three : ( ) The lamlotrigine efficacious sodium valproate maintenance treatment patient bipolar mood disorder recent past episode mixed mania . ( ii ) The lamotrigine patient low relapse rate . ( iii ) The lamotrigine patient low rate depression patient treat sodium valproate . Objective Four : To compare side effect profile lamotrigine treatment mixed mania sodium valproate treatment mixed mania patient bipolar mood disorder recent past episode mixed mania . Hypothesis four : Lamotrigine acute treatment result comparable side effect profile sodium valproate lamotrigine maintenance treatment superior sodium valproate . Methods We plan study two eighteen-subject group ( 36 subject total ) male female study participant age 18 65 1 1/2 year period . The subject enrol inpatient unit Beth Israel Medical Center St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center ( Continuum Health Partners ) follow Center Treatment Affective Disorders Department Psychiatry BIMC . An independent evaluator ( Paul Teusink , M.D . ) affiliate study determine capacity consent . We select patient would least one prior manic episode meet inclusion exclusion criterion depress acute mania ( Dilsaver et al , 1999 ) . The study criterion acute episode irritable depress mania Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) score least 11 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) score least 18 72 hour prior enter study . Patient could randomize study medication she/he come clinic lamotrigine Sodium valprole , she/he low blood level drug . The study two phase . Phase 1 , The Acute Phase . Index medication schedule . Following randomization , first 8-week phase , index manic episode treat either adjust lamotrigine sodium valproate start 25 mg po daily increase biweekly maximal dose 200 mg/day . Dose escalation schedule : week 1-2 25 mg po qd , week 3-4 25 mg po bid , week 5-6 50 mg po bid , week 7-8 100 mg po bid . The dose could decrease low 50 mg/day reduce side effect rash . The sodium valproate treatment initiate load dose 20 mg/kg , dose adjust 250 mg/day increment achieve therapeutic level 100-120 mcg/kg . Concomitant medication schedule . If patient receive mood stabilizer lithium , , carbamazepine , gabapentine , trileptal , lamotrigine sodium valproate beginning study , medication discontinue 72 hour informed consent provide . The following medication permit acute phase trial : clozaril , depot neuroleptic antipsychotic , antidepressant benzodiazepine lorazepam . Rescue medication . Since neuroleptic lorazepam liberally allow treatment acute manic symptom , rescue medication necessary acute phase . Crossover design subject treatment failure . If subject 's condition deteriorate randomization lamotrigine valporate , subject cross arm study , i.e . fail sodium valproate treat lamotrigine vise versa vise versa . Subjects fail crossover switch remove study . Deterioration define three-point worsening patient 's YMRS score last 72 hour . Outcome measure . The severity illness measure Young Mania Rating Scale ( MRS ) , Hamilton Rating scale depression , CGI rating scale . The primary outcome measure YMRS total score change baseline endpoint Phase 1 . The secondary outcome measure HRSD total score change CGI score change baseline Phase 1 endpoint . Other secondary outcome measure amount incidence seclusion restraint , length hospital stay , medical indeces HgA1C , weight change , lipid profile Phase 2 , The Maintenance Phase . If two month treatment patient improve 50 % compare initial level YMRS , HDRS YMRS &lt; 11 , HDRS &lt; 18 patient transfer Maintenance Phase . Index Medication Schedule . The acute phase follow 4 month maintenance phase . In maintenance phase , medication lorazepam ( &lt; 4 mg/ day dose ) lamotrigine sodium valproate type initial 4 week period . In last 3 month study lamotrigine subject receive lamotrigine monotherapy . The dose adjust study physician clinically necessary within dose range Phase 1 . The sodium valproate dose maintain achieve therapeutic level 50-100 mcg/ml . The subject follow weekly first 5 week study . For rest study subject follow biweekly Rescue medication schedule . During maintenance phase , lorazepam taper minimal dose would allow nightly sleep least 8 hr . The dose adjustment do weekly accord follow dose reduction schedule : 4 mg - 3 mg - 2 mg - 1 mg - 0 5 mg - 0 mg take five week depend initial dose . Outcome measure . The primary outcome measure number time either manic depressive episode . The secondary outcome measure average change baseline YMRS , HRSD , CGI score baseline endpoint Phase 2 . We also evaluate medication side effect , need adjunct lorazepam treatment , reason premature discontinuation , demographic data , medical endpoint ( HgbA1C , weight change , lipid profile ) . We use SPSS appropriate statistical method statistical analysis . Study Population The patient population consist psychiatric inpatient Beth Israel Medical Center St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center , meet criterion DSM-IV diagnosis Bipolar Mood Disorder I , manic episode . At present , patient ethnic racial mix 26 % Hispanic , 30 % African American , 45 % Caucasian . The gender distribution 46 % male , 54 % female . The inpatient payer mix 26 % Medicare 50 % Medicaid . The average length stay three unit 19 day patient 26 day patient without co-morbid substance use . In 1999-2001 , inpatient unit BIMC register average 1500 yearly admission , 1350 age 17-65 . Upon admission , approximately 200 patient carry diagnosis Bipolar Mood Disorder I , manic episode , without comorbid substance abuse . The inpatient unit Saint Lukes Roosevelt admit 100 manic patient yearly . If admission demographic remain unchanged 2003 , expect 40 patient per year meet diagnostic inclusion criterion study . Based previous experience recruitment research study , expect 30 % patient meet diagnostic criterion also meet inclusion exclusion criterion , sign inform consent participate study . Therefore expect recruit 36 patient per year complete study accrual 18 month . We plan complete data analysis acute phase within one year . Inclusion Criteria 1 . Males female , age 18-65 . 2 . Ability sign inform consent 3 . Diagnosis Bipolar Mood Disorder I , manic episode . 4 . Mania Rating Scale ( MRS ) score least 11 5 . HDRS score least 18 6 . Global Assessment Scale ( GAS ) score 60 . Exclusion Criteria 1 ) Alcohol substance abuse within last 6 month 2 ) Current diagnosis Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 3 ) Current diagnosis Schizophrenia Schizoaffective Disorder 4 ) Previous adverse reaction allergy lamotrigine sodium valproate Study Design Drug Regimens The study month open label parallel comparison ( blinded rater ) combination therapy lamotrigine 25-200 mg/day ( flexible dosing ) sodium valproate ( flexible dosing ) monotherapy treatment mixed mania two group patient Bipolar Mood Disorder I .
