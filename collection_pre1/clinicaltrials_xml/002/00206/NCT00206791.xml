	<detailed_description>A lot osseous substitution product already use fill osseous defect order prevent loss osseous envisage prejudicial . Synthetic calcium phosphate ceramic ( particularly granulate form ) already show osteoconduction potential human different site . But difficult put granule little place . The injectable form calcium phosphate granule “ ready use ” easier use allow diminution risk infection surgery , permit homogeneity biomaterial . Injectable form calcium phosphate granule already show biocompatibility biofunctionality animal . The purpose study study biocompatibility biofunctionality biomaterial injectable form filling little loss osseous substance various origin charge act biomaterial .</detailed_description>
