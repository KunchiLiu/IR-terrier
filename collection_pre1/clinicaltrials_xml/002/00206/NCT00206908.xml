	<brief_summary>This project design evaluate clinical utility novel blood test , Triage Stroke Panel , aid diagnosis assessment stroke . The Triage Stroke Panel test device , use Triage MeterPlus , rapid , point-of-care immunoassay . The test measure concentration various analytes present EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood plasma , specifically B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , fibrin degradation product contain D-Dimer , matrix metalloproteiase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , S-100B . The test utilizes proprietary algorithm automatic calculation single Multimarker Index ( MMX ) result individual biomarker value . The MMX result evaluate use aid assessment diagnosis stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To date , commercially available blood test approve United States use aid assessment diagnosis stroke . There various report scientific literature describe ability various biomarkers predict identify stroke , varied success . A biomarker panel approach , similar use evaluation chest pain patient ( troponin I , CK-MB , myoglobin ) enhance diagnostic accuracy , particularly panel include protein marker associate various component disease pathophysiology . This study involve retrospective analysis data collect patient present acute focal neurological deficit , suspect cerebral ischemia , suspect intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hour symptom onset last know well time enrol study . Blood sample collect enrollment serially 72 hr . time onset last know well time . The study population also include subset patient subarachnoid hemorrhage , additional sample collect daily day 3 day 14 ( clinical site participate vasospasm substudy ) evaluation cerebral vasospasm . The patient 's participation study complete sample collect discharged hospital , whichever occur first . All blood sample analyze use Triage Stroke Panel test . Measurements perform clinical site Biosite ( subject test device availability ) . In order minimize bias eliminate significant risk patient , physician blind Triage Stroke Panel result course study . Completed case report form ( CRFs ) freeze plasma sample transfer Biosite .</detailed_description>
