	<detailed_description>The EGFR/HER family transmembrane type I receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes play important role fundamental cell process like cell proliferation , differentiation , survival . These receptor tyrosine kinase , include HER1 ( epidermal growth factor receptor , EGFR ) , HER2 ( HER2/neu , c-erbB2 ) , HER3 HER4 contain extracellular domain intracellular protein tyrosine kinase core . Aberrant HER1 HER2 signal causally associate cancer cell proliferation survival . HER1 express over-expressed many human solid tumor play important role progression invasion metastases.. The association HER2 overexpression poor prognosis node-positive advanced breast cancer show number study . Based association member HER1/HER2 family worse clinical outcome , antibodies small molecule specifically target receptor tyrosine kinase develop therapeutic efficacy . Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) highly purify recombinant DNA-derived humanize monoclonal antibody selectively bind high affinity extracellular domain HER2 receptor . Pivotal multicenter efficacy trial metastatic patient show improved response rate disease-free survival patient receive trastuzumab addition chemotherapy . One study open-labeled , multicenter , randomize phase III study evaluate addition trastuzumab standard first-line chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer . This study randomize 469 patient metastatic disease chemotherapy without trastuzumab . Results study show survival patient receive trastuzumab plus chemotherapy almost twice long chemotherapy alone ( 7.2 vs. 4.5 month , p &lt; 0.0001 ) . As dimerization important signal transduction , therapy target one member HER family may great anti-tumor effect . Recently , data trastuzumab plus IMC-C224 human ovarian cancer cell show great growth inhibition compare either monoclonal antibody alone . GW572016 orally active dual HER1/HER2 kinase inhibitor block signal transduction pathway . This dual inhibition attractive therapeutic strategy epithelial cancer , ligand-induced HER1/HER2 dimerization trigger potent proliferative survival signal . In vitro study GW572016 show marked activity , lead growth arrest apoptosis HER1 HER2 overexpressing cell line . GW572016 markedly reduce tyrosine phosphorylation HER1 HER2 , activation MAP kinase Akt , downstream effector proliferation survival , respectively . In vitro study HER-2 overexpressing cell line demonstrate synergistic activity GW572016 combine taxanes . Phase I study GW572016 taxanes complete , result demonstrate small molecule inhibitor may safely combine chemotherapy unanticipated side effect . The EGFR/HER family transmembrane type I receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes play important role fundamental cell process like cell proliferation , differentiation , survival . These receptor tyrosine kinase , include HER1 ( epidermal growth factor receptor , EGFR ) , HER2 ( HER2/neu , c-erbB2 ) , HER3 HER4 contain extracellular domain intracellular protein tyrosine kinase core .

In vitro study HER-2 overexpressing cell line demonstrate synergistic activity GW572016 combine taxanes . Phase I study GW572016 taxanes complete , result demonstrate small molecule inhibitor may safely combine chemotherapy unanticipated side effect . As type I tyrosine kinase involve various aspect cell growth survival , potent quinazoline pyrido- [ 3,4-d ] -pyrimidine small molecule ( GW572016 ) HER1 HER2 develop show potent vitro inhibition HER1 HER2 tumor cell line . Mouse xenograft model BT474 HN5 cell line also show growth inhibition dose-responsive manner . In addition , GW572016 cause reduction HER1 HER2 autophosphorylation , indicate interference signal pathway . GW572016 inhibit baseline activation HER1 HER2 , also show interrupt downstream activation Erk1/2 MAP kinases Akt . HER1 express over-expressed many human solid tumor play important role progression invasion metastases.. The association HER2 overexpression poor prognosis node-positive advanced breast cancer show number study . Based association member HER1/HER2 family worse clinical outcome , antibodies small molecule specifically target receptor tyrosine kinase develop therapeutic efficacy . Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) highly purify recombinant DNA-derived humanize monoclonal antibody selectively bind high affinity extracellular domain HER2 receptor . Pivotal multicenter efficacy trial metastatic patient show improved response rate disease-free survival patient receive trastuzumab addition chemotherapy . One study open-labeled , multicenter , randomize phase III study evaluate addition trastuzumab standard first-line chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer . This study randomize 469 patient metastatic disease chemotherapy without trastuzumab . Results study show survival patient receive trastuzumab plus chemotherapy almost twice long chemotherapy alone ( 7.2 vs. 4.5 month , p &lt; 0.0001 ) . We complete first single-agent neoadjuvant trastuzumab study human breast cancer . The specific aim study firstly , define clinical efficacy trastuzumab , secondly , determine mechanism action human breast cancer specimen . From September 1999 June 2003 , 27 patient HER2 overexpressing locally advance breast cancer without gross metastatic disease , consider phase II study neoadjuvant trastuzumab . At presentation , median tumor size large 8x8 cm2 ( range 4x4 cm2 25x20 cm2 ) . We expect measurable evidence tumor regression short treatment duration . However , regression product bidimensional tumor measurement median decrease -20.0 % ( range 0 , -60.4 % , p=0.0001 ) observe primary tumor 3 week single agent trastuzumab . Most surprisingly , partial response observe 26 % ( 7/27 ) . Minor response see 44 % ( 12/27 ) , stable disease 30 % ( 8/27 ) . No tumor increase size 3-week period . This first neoadjuvant trastuzumab monotherapy study treatment-naive patient HER2 overexpressing breast cancer . The clinical efficacy tumor reduction patient present large initial tumor indicate monoclonal antibody safely administer single agent without fear tumor progression . When study first start , uncertainty clinical efficacy neoadjuvant single agent trastuzumab limit duration 3 week . It seem likely true response rate would higher therapy continue several month . Based data , longer treatment duration HER2 target therapy , like GW572016 , give single agent investigate clinical trial careful monitoring patient assess activity set . Aim 1 : To demonstrate clinical efficacy GW572016 give neoadjuvant therapy single agent patient treatment-naive , locally advanced HER2 overexpressing breast cancer . We aim discover true response rate inhibit HER1/2 signal transduction GW572016 breast cancer patient . Aim 2 : To determine GW572016 inhibits HER1 HER2 signal situ.The mechanism therapeutic action GW572016 fully understand .</detailed_description>
