	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Schizophrenia severe mental disorder affect two percent adult population . Patients present variety symptom include hallucination , delusion bizarre behaviour develop additional `` negative '' symptom amotivational state poverty think . Schizophrenia generally think organic brain disorder psychosocial determinant course outcome . The illness appear heterogenous group patient present distinct differ pattern psychopathology illness course . Part heterogeneity include distinct male female subtypes schizophrenia . In recent time , gender difference schizophrenia receive attention , particular epidemiological psychopathological perspective . Hormonal study utilise investigate underlying neuroendocrine disturbance schizophrenia , information study use development new gender specific treatment strategy . Overall treatment schizophrenia remain gender-blind . The main gender difference observe schizophrenia international consensus include later age onset woman , good response neuroleptic woman , treatment resistant negative symptom men . Women also demonstrate vulnerability psychotic episode menopause , post-partum period low estrogen phase menstrual cycle . From clinical observation , Seeman Lang hypothesise estrogen may provide `` protection '' early onset severe schizophrenia woman , thereby account increase vulnerability lifetime monthly low estrogen phase . Findings basic clinical research warrant investigation hypothesis estrogen protective effect woman female life cycle , also menstrual cycle . We conduct clinical trial patient schizophrenia use estrogen treatment many year , international reputation work area . Initially , conduct open clinical trial acutely ill schizophrenic woman add 0.02mg oral estradiol antipsychotic drug treatment 11 woman . Their response compare seven woman receive antipsychotic drug alone . The estrogen adjunct group show dramatic earlier improvement , significant reduction positive psychotic symptom day 3 treatment . This suggest estradiol may act catalyst treatment could prove important adjunctive treatment therapy schizophrenia . Subsequent early pilot study , conduct double blind placebo control 3-arm study 100mcg , 50mcg estradiol placebo transdermal adjunctive patch . Published Schizophrenia Research ( 2001 ) , result show 100mcg estradiol adjunct afford best outcomes . RESEARCH OBJECTIVES : To investigate usefulness estradiol adjunctive treatment schizophrenia , compare change psychopathology one group patient receive standard antipsychotic drug treatment plus placebo skin patch second match group receive standard antipsychotic drug treatment plus 100mcg estradiol patch double blind , 28 day , control trial . ETHICS REVIEW AND INFORMED CONSENT : The protocol study approve Alfred Ethics Committee . Only patient able give inform consent , i.e . able demonstrate understand objective study implication role , recruit study . Patients extremely psychotic disturbed approach enter study . Involuntary patient able give inform consent able participate possible guardian relative contact notified patient ' involvement . Patients advised participation voluntary free withdraw study stage . CONFIDENTIALITY : Patients ' identity remain anonymous time . Once patient agrees participate study , assign code number ensure anonymity . Information subject restrict researcher directly involve , unless clear management issue , case information share treatment team . Patients ' file store locked filing cabinet access available researcher . All test result share patient family / guardian . STUDY POPULATION : A target number 100 patient recruited three-year period equal number allocate group . Patients recruit inpatient outpatient setting patient may recruit centre provide approval gain appropriate controlling body . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Female patient current DSM 4 diagnosis Schizophrenia , Schizoaffective Schizophreniform Disorder . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : - Female patient pregnant lactate . - Female patient postpartum psychosis relate disorder - Female patient know abnormality hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal-axis , thyroid dysfunction , central nervous system tumour . - Female patient take estrogen preparation oral contraceptive pill . - Female patient whose psychotic illness directly due illicit drug history substance abuse dependence last 6 month . Females significant unstable medical illness cardiovascular disease , renal disease , Addisons disease , thromboembolic disorder , epilepsy , diabetes etc . - Post-menopausal pre-menarche female patient . WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA : Patients free withdraw study stage without offer explanation . Patients experience adverse effect , opinion investigator , serious ( i.e . life threatening , require hospitalisation medical treatment ) withdrawn study immediately . All patient withdraw followed adverse event resolve . STUDY TREATMENTS CONCOMITANT TREATMENTS : All patient participate standard in-patient outpatient psychosocial therapy activity advise treatment team . All patient receive psychotropic non-psychotropic medication per treatment team order . All medication receive study record include analysis . STUDY MEDICATION : The study involve addition transdermal 100mcg estradiol ( transdermal placebo- inactive substance ) standard antipsychotic treatment 4 week . The length trial 1 menstrual cycle , short period estrogen use . Most side effect commonly associate estrogen use relate long term administration thus applicable study . STUDY MEASUREMENTS : The PANSS ( Kay et al . 1987 ) perform screening/baseline evaluation visit . The PANSS consist Positive Scale ( 7 positive symptom construct ) , Negative Scale ( 7 negative symptom construct ) General Psychopathology Scale ( 16 symptom construct ) . This scale primary outcome measure trial . In addition PANSS , Adverse Symptom Checklist , Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale , Simpson Angus Scale serum hormone measurement complete visit . Cognitive testing perform monthly . Participants assess baseline , day 7 , day 14 , day 21 day 28 . DATA MANAGEMENT : All data gather entered patient file patient code number . Files store research unit lock filing cabinet . Data enter computer do use patient code number identification . A separate booklet use record data collect screening , baseline , evaluation visit . All file retain hospital period 15 year completion discontinuation trial .</detailed_description>
