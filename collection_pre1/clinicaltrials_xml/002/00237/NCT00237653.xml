	<brief_summary>The main objective study demonstrate relevance Valganciclovir recurrent bout cryptogenic inflammatory bowel disease infection cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) . The goal obtain 90 % ( Valganciclovir treat patient ) versus 50 % ( placebo treat patient ) remission 3 month ( include discontinuation corticoid reduce dose 20 mg prednisone equivalence ) , without relapse 6 following month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MICI-CMV : Valganciclovir Recurrent Bouts Cryptogenic Inflammatory Bowel Diseases With Infection Cytomegalovirus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) DNA virus herpes virus family . It pass human even infection widespread ( 50 80 % people older 35 CMV immunoglobulin G positive ) often asymptomatic immunocompetent people . However , immunocompromised people , infection take particular frequency , expression seriousness , high frequency attack digestive track ( CMV colitis ) . For immunocompetent people , colitis cause feverish bloody diarrhea associate abdominal pain . Colitis diagnosis often late case complication report ( digestive bleeding , toxic giant colon perforation ) . The endoscopic aspect colitis specific diagnosis base serology , anatomopathology immunochemistry . Recently , PCR approach allow sensitive diagnosis . CMV INVOLVEMENT IN CIBD PHYSIOPATHOLOGY : Even though CMV involvement colitis rare sure immunocompetent people , involvement CIBD trigger morbidity solve yet . Some author think infection CMV may act CIBD trigger factor ; since 2 case CMV colitis coincide onset CIBD report . For author , infection CMV act direct pathogenicity cause ulcerative lesion colonic mucosa imitates CIBD without trigger . A third hypothesis infection CMV aggravate inflammatory bowel disease act exacerbate factor . In case , people suffer CIBD highly-exposed infection CMV due immunosuppressive treatment ( corticoid , cyclosporine , azathioprin , methotrexate ) inflammation ( suppose proning factor ) . CMV AND POUCHITIS : Pouchitis common long-term complication total proctocolectomy . Usually , cure antibiotic therapy , 15 % case become chronic turn onto refractory pouchitis difficult cure . Infection CMV imitate chronic pouchitis clinical endoscopic view . In case , show Valganciclovir treatment ( 10mg/kg/day ) lead significant improvement 21 day treatment period . CONCLUSION : Infection CMV seem play important role take account CIBD physiopathogeny . Probably underestimated since necessarily search , could trigger factor treatment resistance factor . Immunosuppressive drug use towards recurrent bout , particularly cyclosporine , favor viral reactivation . Then , recurrent bout CIBD may complicate CMV infection . That could interest establish relevance antiviral treatment recurrent bout CIBD infection CMV . The main objective study demonstrate relevance Valganciclovir recurrent bout Cryptogenic Inflammatory Bowel Diseases infection Cytomegalovirus . The goal obtain 90 % ( Valganciclovir treat patient ) versus 50 % ( placebo treat patient ) remission 3 month ( include discontinuation corticoid reduce dose 20 mg prednisone equivalence ) , without relapse 6 following month . Secondary objective : - Reversal CMV immunoglobulin G serology PCR result colonic biopsy . - Improvement appearance histological lesion - Reduction number colectomies - Evaluation Valganciclovir tolerance side effect</detailed_description>
