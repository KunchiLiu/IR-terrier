	<brief_summary>The study look 2 hypothesis 2 patient group : 1 . Are experienced endoscopists well detect subtle lesion ( polyp ) line colon ( large bowel ) less experienced endoscopists ? 2 . Do exist new technique highlight lesion line bowel improve endoscopists ability spot ? This test use video footage endoscopies 2 patient group : normal colon linig colitis ( bowel line inflamation )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Experience Enhancement : Improving Colonoscopic Polyp Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer second commonest cause cancer death . In majority case preceeded precancerous lesion call adenoma ( commonly know polyp ) . Patients colitis specially high risk colorectal cancer estimate 18 % 30 year disease . Detection removal adenoma colonoscopy show reduce death rate colorectal cancer . However , despite meticulous examination `` miss rate '' adenoma colonoscopy range 6-15 % back-to-back colonoscopy study . The nature polyps well pedunculated ( cherry like ) flat depress make difficult see may also contribute `` miss rate '' . The factor affect whether endoscopist see polyp well study . Polyp detection rate vary widely , even amongst expert . Endoscopist experience assume improve polyp detection rate ; however one study least experienced endoscopists find polyp . Techniques highlight lesion advanced recent year . Chromoendoscopy , spray dye bowel lining , show help pick pre-cancerous polyp one three study normal patient seem definitely helpful colitis . Autofluorescence endoscopy narrow band image use light filter produce false colour image bowel line polyp stand . These technique use success oesophagus stomach little work available colon . High definition endoscopy produce clear image may also help polyp detection . This study aim collect video colonoscopy colonoscope remove . This main time polyp look . Some videos subtle polyp . The study re-examine re-video area use one technique may make polyp stand well . The aim get videos polyp without technique highlight lesion normal colon colitis . These video show endoscopist differ experience test ability spot lesion depend experience see technique make lesion stand help see lesion easily .</detailed_description>
