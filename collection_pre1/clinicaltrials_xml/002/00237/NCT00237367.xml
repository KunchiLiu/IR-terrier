	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare pharmacodynamics ( way drug work body ) rabeprazole pantoprazole intragastric acidity esophageal acid exposure gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) patient nighttime heartburn . Patients give one dose medication washout period 6 13 day dos ( `` washout period '' mean receive proton pump inhibitor medication 6-13 day , allow 1st dose completely leave body ) . Rabeprazole approve United States short-term treatment ( 4-8 week ) heal symptomatic relief erosive ulcerative GERD symptom daytime nighttime heartburn , maintenance heal erosive ulcerative GERD , treatment symptomatic GERD . The dosage regimen GERD indication 20 mg day . Other indication include heal duodenal ulcer , Helicobacter pylori eradication reduce risk duodenal ulcer recurrence , treatment pathological hypersecretory condition include Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome . The common side effect rabeprazole headache . In clinical trial headache assess possibly related rabeprazole 2.4 % subject vs. 1.6 % placebo . Pantoprazole dose 40 mg day indicate short-term treatment ( 8 week ) heal symptomatic relief erosive esophagitis , maintenance heal erosive esophagitis reduction relapse rate daytime nighttime heartburn symptom patient GERD . Other indication include pathological hypersecretory condition include Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome . The common side effect headache diarrhea .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Rabeprazole Pantoprazole Stomach Acid Esophageal Acid Exposure Patients With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) History Nighttime Heartburn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare effect single dose two drug , rabeprazole pantoprazole , reduce amount acid stomach esophagus subject GERD . This study conduct one investigational center . The investigator blind ( know whether patient take rabeprazole pantoprazole ) . The study comparative , randomize , single dose , two-way crossover , pharmacodynamic study examine effectiveness rabeprazole pantoprazole stomach acidity esophageal acid exposure GERD patient nighttime heartburn . Patients randomize ( like toss coin ) one two sequence receive study medication ; either one dose rabeprazole first treatment period follow one dose pantoprazole second treatment period one dose pantoprazole first treatment period follow one dose rabeprazole second treatment period . The study measure acid level stomach esophagus change one dose either study medication . The primary endpoint percent time stomach pH great 4 ( pH level consider normal ) 24-hour period single dose study medication . Another endpoint 24-hour esophageal reflux time single dose study medication . The esophageal acid exposure determine measure much acid flow backwards stomach esophagus . Patients participate two 48-hour treatment period intragastric ( stomach ) esophageal pH record 8-second interval use probe insert nose stomach . The two treatment period separate washout period 6 13 day . On day treatment period , patient dose morning . During treatment period , patient receive placebo Day 1 , active treatment ( either rabeprazole pantoprazole ) Day 2 . The main objective study compare effect single dose rabeprazole 20 milligram pantoprazole 40 milligram intragastric acidity esophageal acid exposure GERD patient history nighttime heartburn safety monitor study . Rabeprazole 20 milligram tablet mouth ; pantoprazole 40 milligram tablet mouth</detailed_description>
