	<detailed_description>Bipolar II disorder largely unstudied , much less know treatment comparison Bipolar I disorder . While establish mood stabilizer treat prevent subsequent episode hypomania , chronic recurrent depression harder treat prevent . In general treatment depression Bipolar II patient often complicate clinical unanimity approach follow . Administration proven antidepressant would seem appropriate often use , use often involve number difficulty . Among : - antidepressant efficacy establish unipolar patient extrapolation Bipolar II patient do without empirical support - Bipolar II patient switch hypomanic behavior response antidepressant treatment give monotherapy - even mood stabilizer concomitantly give , switch hypomanic state still occur antidepressant add - antidepressant cause cycle acceleration induce rapid cycling give Bipolar II patient - non-response loss response common reaction antidepressant Bipolar II patient This study also assess tolerability Geodon treatment patient diagnose Bipolar II disorder currently meet criterion Major Depressive Episode examine incidence adverse event withdrawal rate due adverse event . This open-label study . Subjects treat 8 week Geodon , start dose 20 mg twice per day . The maximum dose 60 mg twice per day .
