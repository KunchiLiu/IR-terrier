	<brief_summary>Heparin drug widely use prevent treat blood clotting . Individuals undergo cardiopulmonary bypass surgery administer high dos heparin , develop antibody drug . This immune response lead formation blood clot , set stage potential heart attack stroke . The purpose study evaluate often immune response heparin lead formation blood clot individual heart surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heparin drug widely use prevent treat blood clotting . However , heparin also cause serious adverse event . Individuals undergo cardiopulmonary bypass surgery administer therefore exposed high dos heparin . Studies show 61 % cardiac bypass patient develop elevated level antibody heparin-PF4 surgery . This immune response may activate blood platelet , possibly result blood clot . These clot often develop legs lung , may lead heart attack stroke . The frequency reaction yet determine definitively . This study evaluate incidence immune response heparin-PF4 lead formation blood clot individual heart surgery . Participants study recruit prior schedule cardiac bypass surgery . They first complete structure pre-operative interview collect baseline measure demographic , comorbidities , history heparin exposure , prior thromboembolic event . Immediately prior surgery , blood sample take assess individual 's platelet count level antibody heparin-PF4 . Following operation , participant follow daily ass heparin exposure , platelet count , blood clotting . Subsequent blood sample take 5 day 1 month follow surgery evaluate individual 's platelet count level heparin-PF4 antibody . Additionally , participant undergo structure interview 1 3 month post-surgery evaluate incidence outcome related heparin-PF4 antibody .</detailed_description>
