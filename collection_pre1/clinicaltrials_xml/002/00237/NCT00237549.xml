	<brief_title>The ADDITION Study . Intensive Treatment People With Screen Detected Diabetes Primary Care .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims : - To develop evaluate strategy early detection type 2 diabetes different country different population . - To study whether multifactorial treatment strategy reduce CVD-mortality reduce incidence macro- microvascular complication . The treatment strategy consist motivational interviewing , encourage behavioural change ( dietary advises , physical activity , smoke cessation ) intensive pharmacological treatment blood pressure , blood glucose , serum lipid - To identify genetic marker predict development diabetic complication - To evaluate health economical consequence screen early intervention type 2 diabetes Design method : The study investigator initiate design study , initiate Denmark two principal investigator , plan conduct collaboration four center Denmark , UK Netherlands . The study two element : screening study subsequent intervention study . In screen study , feasibility result country specific model identify undiagnosed individual Type 2 diabetes evaluate . In treatment study effect routine care general practice accord local national guideline compare intensive ADDITION protocol , include structure lifestyle education ( dietary modification , increase physical activity smoke cessation ) intensive treatment blood glucose , blood pressure lipid , prophylactic aspirin without motivational interviewing , mortality , macrovascular microvascular disease . Furthermore impact treatment health status , treatment satisfaction health service cost also assess . Methodology - Screening study : In Denmark &gt; 300 primary care physicians 5 different county ( Copenhagen , Aarhus , Ringkøbing , Ribe Sønderjylland ) participate study . Diabetes-related information send individual age 40-69 year enrolled practice . A questionnaire ( diabetes risk score29 ) include age , gender , family history type 2 diabetes ; obesity ; physical activity previously diagnose hypertension use . Individuals score high questionnaire encourage contact physician examination random blood glucose ( RGB ) HbA1c . A step-wise strategy base RBG , HbA1c , FPG OGTT use diagnose diabetes In Netherlands people age 50-69 year list participate primary care physician invite fill diabetes risk questionnaire base risk factor Denmark . Those high risk type 2 diabetes request come screening visit centre set near general practice . A stepwise screen strategy base RBG , FPG OGTT use diagnose diabetes In UK , different strategy use Cambridgeshire Leicester . In Cambridgeshire search computerise general practice record perform , use simple validate risk score , base routine general practice data ( age , gender , prescribed medication body mass index ) , identify people age 40-69 year high risk undiagnosed diabetes30 . Those high score undergo stepwise screen strategy base RBG , FPG OGTT use diagnose diabetes In Leicester white European subject age 40-75 year Asian , black Chinese subject age 25-75 year invite restrict geographical region within Leicester . All attendant undergo OGTT first screen step ( unless FPG &gt; 7.0 mmol/l ) Diagnostic procedure : The diagnostic procedure include stepwise procedure minimize work-load general practitioner include questionnaire , random capillary blood glucose HbA1c screening instrument follow fast capillary blood glucose ( FCBG ) oral glucose tolerance test everyone marginally elevate FCBG . The diagnostic criterion follow recent World Health Organization guideline ( 31 ) base two diagnostic glucose value measure independent day . Exclusion criterion : Participants exclude already diabetes , pregnant lactate severe psychotic illness , house bound illness likely survival less one year . Outcome measure : Outcome measure screen study include measure efficacy screen campaign , objective health status patient newly identify campaign , feasibility report primary care physician , economic impact benefit programme . Furthermore substudy explore psycho-social ethical aspect screen programme . Methodology - Intervention study : All patient diagnose part screen programme invite enter ADDITION-study . The study include minimum 3000 patient screen detect diabetes . The general practice randomise routine care group ( standard care give GP ) intervention group feature target driven , intensive multifactorial approach treatment . The study open , multicentre , parallel group trial randomisation general practice . Patients screen recruited period January 1st 2000 June 30th 2006 . The end follow July 1st 2009 . Participation base informed consent accordance Declaration Helsinki . Intensive Treatment strategy : The intensive multifactorial treatment include lifestyle advice ( concern diet , physical activity , medication adherence tobacco cessation ) , prescription aspirin stepwise increase pharmacological treatment blood glucose , blood pressure lipid , accord strict target ( appendix 1 ) . The treatment target follow : - HbA1c &lt; 7.0 - Total cholesterol &lt; 5.0 mmol/l ( 4.5 mmol/l CVD present ) statin everyone total cholesterol &gt; 3.5 mmol/l - Blood pressure &lt; 135/85 - Aspirin 75- 150 mg/day everyone antihypertensive treatment Behavioural advice include - Smoking cessation - Physical activity 30 min./day - Healthy diet ( low fat , 600g fruit vegetables/day ) The treatment target may intensify study accord result clinical trial publish study period , aim strive treatment target base intensive guideline available . Within intensive group randomisation allocate 50 % patient country specific intervention concerned improve adherence lifestyle change medication . This intervention , include use motivational interviewing ) deliver either trained facilitator ( UK The Netherlands ) training practitioner ( Denmark ) , base client-centred non-directive counseling style help patient explore resolve ambivalence stimulate lifestyle change , appropriate diabetes self-care adherence medical treatment 32,33 . Pharmacological treatment : The decision pharmaceutical drug use individual patient make clinician study target drive trial compare different specific drug . The clinician provide recommendation treatment strategy ( appendix 1 ) , base balance treatment effect , side-effects cost . The main priority achievement treatment target flexible lifestyle low rate side effect hypoglycaemia weight gain . Therapies adjust 2 4-weekly interval target reach , thereafter every 3 month . HbA1c take every third month , antidiabetic drug adjust accord blood glucose measurement interim . Outcome measure : see section . Sample size statistical power : Based level risk conservative-treatment arm UKPDS , expect event rate 3 % per year combine endpoint ( all-cause mortality , nonfatal myocardial infarction , stroke , revascularisation amputation ) . With sample size 1350 patient arm ( standard versus intensive treatment ) study allow detection 30 % risk reduction intervention group significance level 5 % mean duration follow-up 5 year . Timescale : The screening study begin late 2000 end June 30th 2006 . Patients enrol treatment study follow diagnosis screen study : thus treatment study proceeds along evaluation phase screen study . The follow-up continue July 1st 2009 . Ethics safety : The Scientific Ethics Committee involved county Denmark Multipractice Study Committee accept project , study approve ethical committee UK Netherlands . A data safety monitoring committee access end point data ( unblinded ) 1 , 3 5 year , study terminate composite end point ( include : Cardiovascular death , non-fatal MI , non-fatal stroke , revascularisation amputation ) demonstrate clear advantage intensive versus standard treatment ( p &lt; 0.001 ) clear advantage standard versus intensive treatment ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . Perspectives trial : The result study immediate national international relevance policy decision screen diabetes , subsequent intensive treatment . If study show screen early intervention markedly reduce risk develop premature CVD , study potential important impact individual patient level well societal level . If study fail show effect screen early intensive treatment would direct impact future recommendation screen treatment regimen , study could lead significant saving show strict treatment target essential early phase disease . The result sub-study inform approach health promotion management chronic disease risk , strategy support adherence applicable diabetes also chronic disease .
