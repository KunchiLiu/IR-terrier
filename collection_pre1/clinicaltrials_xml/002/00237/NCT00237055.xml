	<brief_summary>Six site Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Consortium ( plus 2 additional site ) participate study . The participate site Principal Investigator ( PI ) , Emory University School Medicine , Atlanta , GA ( Benjamin D. Gold , MD ) ; Texas Children 's Hospital / Baylor College Medicine ( George Ferry , MD Tony Olive , MD ) ; Children 's Hospital Philadelphia , Philadelphia , PA ( Bob Baldassano , MD ) ; University Chicago Children 's Hospital , Chicago , IL ( Barbara Kirschner , MD ) ; University California , San Francisco ( Mel Heyman , MD ) ; Mass General Hospital / Harvard University ( Harland Winter , MD ) ; V.A . Stanford University School Medicine , Stanford , CA ( David Relman , MD ) ; Children 's Center For Digestive Healthcare , Atlanta , GA ( Stanley Cohen , MD ) ; Centers Disease Control Prevention , Atlanta , GA ( Drs . Jeannette Guarner , Siobhan O'Connor Thomas Shinnick ) The duration study 2 yr . Objectives : 1 . Improve method collect biopsy colon ileum , tissue storage technique best method detect specific infection child Crohn 's disease ; 2 . Determine specific infectious agent common child Crohn 's disease , ; 3 . Determine type child Crohn 's disease ( e.g. , child live Boston , African American child ) may risk get infection . The study design involve child age 6 month 17 11/12 year age undergoing clinically-indicated colonoscopy . Subjects group case control . - Any child age 6 mo 17 11/12 year age , undergo clinically-indicated colonoscopy determine treat physician , eligible enrollment . About 500 patient enrol study . - Cases consist child within defined age group , undergo diagnostic colonoscopy definitive diagnosis Crohn 's disease . - Children diagnosis indeterminate colitis ulcerative colitis purpose R03 , exclude case initial analysis , tissue specimen bank subsequent evaluation infectious agent . - Controls consist child within defined age group , undergo clinically indicate colonoscopy diagnose Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis indeterminate colitis ( e.g. , juvenile polyp , irritable bowel syndrome functional bowel disease ) . - Stool specimen ( 5ml/1 tsp ) collect test different type bacteria - A questionnaire administer research volunteer . - Each subject 's medical information ( i.e . diagnosis , disease stage , laboratory result ) store electronically separate access-based database . A unique identifier assign patient enter study also use blind specimen analyze pathologist molecular assay infectious agent . - Colonoscopy perform treat pediatric gastroenterologist biopsy obtain usual standard care . - Clinical biopsy rectum , leave , right , transverse colon cecum place formalin contain vial per standard care clinical pathologist diagnostic evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , include CD ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , estimate affect approximately 1 - 2 million Americans . Recent study strongly suggest disorder increase prevalence develop develop country , first generation immigrant industrialized nation . Changing epidemiology IBD implies , addition genetic susceptibility disease , environmental trigger exposure likely impact disease expression . However , specific pathobiology etiology IBD remain unclear . Knowledge host genetic basis IBD advance , include characterization novel susceptibility gene adult adolescent CD ( NOD2/CARD-15 ) locate pericentromeric region chromosome 16 . Recent study implicate NOD2/CARD-15 susceptibility CD , also suggest link innate immune response bacterial component development disease . Thus , well-designed investigation infectious etiology CD , sufficient power detect difference infection IBD non-IBD patient , critically need . Yet , deficiency methods tool study still exist . Both infectious noninfectious mechanism pathogenesis remain plausible unconfirmed . To date , scientific evidence conclude whether one infectious pathogens trigger determines development outcomes CD UC . Persistent exposure `` normal resident flora '' abnormally permeable gut might also conceivably determine disease . Thus carefully design investigation apply systematically evaluate , reliable reproducible detection assay need confirm disprove infectious hypothesis causation . The first step pilot study validates study design complementary assay ( morphology- , molecular- culture-based ) uniformly applies target patient control tissue ( i.e. , pediatric endoscopic biopsy ) . It must focus newly diagnose CD ( surrogate `` incident '' CD ) well-characterized group patient appropriate , well-selected control meet uniform case control definition . It must develop reproducible method ensure result different study compare appropriate clinical interpretation make order translate research result treatment prevention strategy decrease burden CD . At time , deficiency methodology laboratory technology impede successful conduct interpretation need study causality . Based age onset , newly diagnose child IBD , may closer trigger immunopathogenic event initiate inflammatory response adult . They may also represent unique population study environmental factor ( e.g. , infection ) , i.e. , young age usually bring short less complicated exposure history confound analysis . It reasonable postulate single agent polymicrobial insult , genetically susceptible host , may determine development course CD may easier identify infectious determinant childhood CD . We hypothesize adequate collection intestinal tissue biopsy uniformly define pediatric CD case control validation sensitive specific laboratory tool detect potential infectious trigger CD particular specimen type need test causality infection CD . The Pedi IBDC , 6 large , geographically diverse U.S. center represent excellent platform investigate potential infectious factor CD , annually evaluate record clinical epidemiologic data ~288 newly diagnose pediatric CD case comprehensive data repository . The Pedi IBDC system assess safety efficacy research . The Consortium also provide pool case control implement standardized specimen collection technique well-conceived algorithm . The R03 assemble research team draw wide range expertise institutional resource epidemiology , infectious disease pathology , molecular microbiology , mycobacteriology virology , conduct clinical trial . The multi-disciplinary expertise proposal test validate small endoscopic biopsy histopathology molecular microbial detection assay previously validate alternative paraffin-embedded frozen tissue . The R03 funding mechanism facilitate tissue collection banking technique evaluation panel assay detect select infectious agent range thought cause CD speculate etiologic , non-pathogenic commensal know undetermined pathogen . Therefore , specific study aim : 1. standardize collection ( e.g. , anatomic site biopsy origin , biopsy number collection technique ) , process bank gastrointestinal tissue biopsy obtain clinically-indicated endoscopy well-characterized child CD follow Pedi IBDC ; 2. verify standardize definition appropriate control , evaluate `` non-diseased '' biopsy case clinically-indicated biopsy child without IBD ( e.g. , juvenile polyposis , Hirschsprung 's disease ) improve design future study ; 3. standardize validate pediatric biopsy detection method identify potential infectious risk factor CD parallel , pair complementary pathology-based ( IHC ) , broad range amplification-based molecular ( PCR ) organism-specific ( e.g. , MAP ) molecular analysis , primary culture tissue specimens take well-defined case control . Additionally , molecular characterization microbiota feces case control compare microbial detection respective tissue biopsy . Successful completion goal provide platform imminent comprehensive investigation characterize clinically relevant microbial risk factor CD child quite possibly adult patient .</detailed_description>
