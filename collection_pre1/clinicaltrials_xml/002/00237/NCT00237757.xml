	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Team Functioning Patient Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The benefit team treatment widely accept . Prior research show rehabilitation team go work make difference patient treat . However , little information , specifically , team result patient able . The objective clinical trial test whether team training intervention stroke rehabilitation associate improved patient outcome . We conduct cluster randomize trial 31 rehabilitation unit compare stroke outcome intervention control group . thirty-one VA medical center 237 clinical staff 16 control team 227 staff 15 intervention team . There 487 stroke patient treat teams intervention . The intervention consist multiphase , staff training program deliver six month , include : off-site workshop emphasize team dynamic , problem solving , use performance feedback data ; action plan process improvement ; telephone videoconference consultation . Control intervention team receive site- specific team performance profile recommendation use information modify team process . The main outcome measure consist three patient outcome : functional improvement measure change motor item Function Independence Measure ( FIM ) , community discharge , length stay ( LOS ) . For primary ( stroke ) secondary analysis ( patient ) , significant difference improvement functional outcome two group , percentage stroke patient gain median FIM gain 23 point increase significantly intervention group ( difference increase = 13.6 % , P=0.032 ) . There significant difference LOS rate community discharge . Stroke patient treat staff participate team training program likely make functional gain treated staff receive information . This study randomize cluster trial test used workshop train rehabilitation staff . Patients treat trained team compare patient treated team workshop train . Stroke patient</detailed_description>
