	<detailed_description>Urea cycle disorder group rare genetic disease affect protein break body . UCDs cause deficiency one six enzyme two mitochondrial membrane transporter responsible remove ammonia , waste product protein metabolism , bloodstream . Normally , ammonia convert urea remove body form urine . In UCDs , however , ammonia accumulates unchecked remove body . It reach brain blood , cause irreversible brain damage and/or death . All UCDs , except one ( ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ) , inherit recessive trait . The purpose study perform long-term analysis large group individual various UCDs . Biochemical status , growth , cognitive function assess . Survival cognitive outcome two commonly use form treatment , alternate pathway therapy transplantation , evaluate . In addition , study identify biochemical change may predict future metabolic imbalance may correct clinical symptom develop . This observational study fund 2019 . All participant attend initial study visit , include medical diet history , physical neurological examination , psychological testing , blood test . Participants follow subsequent study visit , last 2-3 hour . Individuals neonatal onset UCD assess every 3 month age 2 every 6 month thereafter . Individuals late onset UCD evaluate every 6 month . Psychological test take place every 2 year . Psychological test take 30 minute ( young child ) 3 hour , depend test battery .</detailed_description>
