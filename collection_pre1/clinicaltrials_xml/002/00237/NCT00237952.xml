	<brief_summary>Background The relationship long-term heavy lead exposure chronic interstitial nephropathy well recognize previous literature . Several epidemiological study demonstrate positive association blood lead level age relate decrease renal function general population suggest environmental low-level lead exposure may accelerate progression renal function healthy person . In addition , previous work suggest environmental lead exposure may correlate progressive renal insufficiency lead chelation therapy repeat lead chelation may improve slow progressive renal insufficiency non-diabetic patient chronic renal disease . However , Diabetes mellitus increase prevalence worldwide currently estimate affect 6.5 percent population United States . In addition , diabetes common cause end-stage renal disease many country , account 40 percent case . It still unknown relationship long-term environmental lead exposure progressive renal insufficiency patient type II diabetes diabetic nephropathy . Methods Ninety patints type II diabetes diabetic nephropathy ( serum creatinine level 1.5 mg per deciliter 3.9 mg per deciliter ) normal body lead burden history exposure lead metal observe 24 month . Then , 50 subject high normal body lead burden ( least 80 μg less 600 μg ) randomly assign study control group . For three month , 25 patient study group receive lead-chelation therapy calcium disodium EDTA weekly body lead burden fallsl 50 μg , 25 control group receive weekly placebo . During ensue 12 month , renal function regularly follow every 3 month EDTA mobilization test assess every 6 month . If body lead burden study group patient increase 60μg , chelation therapy perform body burden le 60 μg . The primary end point increase serum creatinine level 2 time base-line value observation period . A secondary end point change renal function follow period .</brief_summary>
