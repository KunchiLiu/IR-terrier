	<brief_summary>Asthma gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) common disorder , although usually lethal , high morbidity , high healthcare cost . Recent study demonstrate asthma GERD often co-exists , co-existence frequent chance . Therefore , study characterize association condition , , help development intervention positively impact outcome patient , critically need . Subjects participate study require age 4-11 year old . This protocol propose enroll 100 child asthma , inhale steroid poor asthma control , define basis frequent symptom , excessive beta-agonists use , frequent asthma episode . The purpose research study : 1 . Determine , whether child symptomatic , poorly control , asthma assign treatment PPI ( Proton Pump Inhibitor ) , few asthma exacerbation similar participant assign placebo similar duration time 2 . Determine whether child treat Lansoprazole ( i.e. , proton pump inhibitor ) : long time first exacerbation , improve lung function , improve asthma symptom score , improve quality life , decrease rescue inhaler use , asthma medication , reduce emergency room/urgent care/ physician office visit asthma relate . 3 . Determine whether subgroup symptomatic asthmatic , show great benefit PPI 's , identify .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>GERD asthma likely co-exist , may pathogenetically link . However , controversial whether GERD per se important risk factor severe asthma , whether treatment GERD and/or GERD symptoms improve asthma control . In addition , publish data often asthmatic treat anti-secretory agent proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) GERD . However , preliminary survey American Lung Association 's Asthma Clinical Research Centers consortium show diverse practice pattern among clinic 15 % child 20 % - 30 % adult prescribe medical treatment ( unpublished data ) . The NIH Expert Panel The Diagnosis Management Asthma , recommend `` …for patient poorly control asthma , particularly nocturnal component , investigation gastroesophageal reflux may warrant even absence suggestive symptom '' . The American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) workshop severe refractory asthma , conclude GERD `` …could contribute severity '' asthma recommend patient severe refractory asthma undergo esophageal pH probe monitor evaluate presence GERD '' . Noticeably absent `` expert panel '' document randomize placebo control trial data population , properly design clinical trial information pediatric population clear case control definition GERD asthma . The American Gastroenterological Association recommend ambulatory pH probe monitoring adult patient reflux-triggered asthma ; , date develop recommendation child 20 . While reasonable recommendation , convince evidence GERD common patient severe asthma mild asthma , treatment reflux decrease asthma severity . PPIs , effective treatment GERD ( i.e. , resolve symptom mucosal disease ) , retail cost $ 100 $ 153 per month . However , recent hospital data demonstrate anti-reflux surgery perform increase rate child respiratory manifestation GERD sizeable cost long term outcome study date . Thus , estimate cost diagnose treat GERD symptomatic asthmatic range $ 1 $ 8 billion dollar per year poorly control asthmatic investigate treated . Therefore , randomize control clinical trial critically need reduce overall healthcare cost public health burden two chronic condition .</detailed_description>
