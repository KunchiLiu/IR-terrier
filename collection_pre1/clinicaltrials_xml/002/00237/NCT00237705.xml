	<brief_summary>Concussion define temporary disturbance brain function follow blow head . It may involve loss consciousness usually result post concussive headache ( PCH ) immediately injury . Between 30 50 percent patient concussion develop postconcussive syndrome ( PCS ) consist symptom headache , variety debilitating symptom last several week month . The objective study determine metoclopramide , drug commonly use treatment migraine headache , effective relieve PCH prevent PCS . Eligible patient history concussion result headache within past 24 hour . Patients rate pain standard scale treat one two intravenous dos either metoclopramide saltwater placebo . They contact telephone 1 , 4 8 week later order determine develop postconcussive syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Metoclopramide Treatment Post Concussive Headache : Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES The primary objective study prospectively evaluate effect metoclopramide ED patient minor head injury . The primary hypothesis administration intravenous metoclopramide effective relieving symptom acute post traumatic headache ED patient minor head injury . The secondary hypothesis administration intravenous metoclopramide also effective reduce incidence chronic post-concussive syndrome ED patient minor head injury . The research question `` Does administration intravenous metoclopramide dose 10 20 mg adult ED patient experience headache follow minor head injury result significant decrease pain severity measure 10cm visual analogue scale , compare placebo ? '' RESEARCH METHODOLOGY This prospective , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial . Only patient meet follow inclusion criterion recruit : 1 . History blunt head trauma within precede 24 hour 2 . Immediate transient post traumatic impairment neurological function alteration consciousness , amnesia , disorientation , disturbance vision equilibrium . 3 . Onset headache within one hour trauma . 4 . Significant intra-cranial injury exclude CT scan clinical assessment . Exclusion criterion include age less equal 16 year , know suspected pregnancy , know hypersensitivity intolerance metoclopramide , inability give inform consent , know gastrointestinal hemorrhage , perforation obstruction , know seizure disorder , know pheochromocytoma , concurrent significant CNS depression due drug alcohol , concurrent treatment psychiatric illness . Patients randomize ask grade headache pain severity 10-cm non-hatched visual analog scale ( VAS ) administration study drug . They receive either 10 mg ( 2ml ) metoclopramide 2 ml saline placebo . After 15 minute complete VAS . If headache satisfactorily relieve offer second dose study drug VAS complete 30 minute later . Patients contact 1 , 4 8 week later order complete telephone questionnaire ass PCS symptom . The primary comparison proportion patient achieve significant pain relief two study arm difference 20 % great proportion consider clinically significant . A t-test two proportion use p less equal 0.05 consider statistically significant . Secondary outcomes evaluated hypothesis generate purpose use appropriate parametric non-parametric statistic correction multiple comparison need .</detailed_description>
