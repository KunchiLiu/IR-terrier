	<detailed_description>Detailed Description Background : There 65 million Americans 8.5 million veteran diagnosed hypertension ; yet 31 % hypertensive patient blood pressure ( BP ) effective control ( &lt; 140/90 mm/Hg ) . Uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cerebral vascular accident , coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction , renal failure , congestive heart failure , mortality . Despite damaging impact hypertension availability well-defined therapy widely accept target value BP , intervention improve BP control limit success . Objectives : The study one first compare three intervention design improve BP control : behavioral educational intervention , evidence-based medication management intervention , combine intervention patient poor BP control define home BP monitoring . The primary hypothesis : 1 ) Patients receive behavioral intervention show improve rate BP control compare control group 18 month follow-up ; 2 ) Patients receive hypertension medication management intervention show improve rate BP control compare control group 18 month follow-up ; , 3 ) Patients receive combine intervention show high rate BP control compare patient 18 month follow-up . Methods : A three-year randomized control trial among veteran poor BP control test three intervention three VA primary care clinic propose improve BP control . We test intervention use home BP monitor four group design administer via telephone : 1 ) control group - group hypertensive patient receive usual care ; 2 ) Nurse-administered tailored behavioral intervention previously test ( HSR &amp; D grant IIR 20-034 ) ; 3 ) Nurse-administered medication management accord hypertension decision support system use VA 's Computerized Medical Record System ( VA HSR &amp; D grant CPI 99275 ) ; 4 ) combination tailor behavioral medication management intervention . A random sample hypertensive patient poor BP control baseline consent randomly allocate one four arm . The intervention activate home BP monitoring indicate inadequate BP control . Patients assign behavioral intervention receive tailor self-management intervention promote adherence medication , information risk hypertension health behavior periodic telephone contact . Patients receive feedback recent BP value , continuous patient education , monitor supported enhance treatment adherence . Patients randomized medication management arm hypertension regimen change nurse use hypertension decision support system develop validated VA . Medication recommendation generate base JNC 7 VA 's hypertension treatment guideline also individualized patient ' comorbid illness , laboratory value , element patient ' clinical status . Medication management base home BP monitoring deliver telephone . The nurse part extend primary care team communicates change patient ' primary care provider via study physician . The primary outcome dichotomous measure represent whether patient 's BP control : &gt; 140/90 mm/Hg ( non-diabetic ) &gt; 130/80 mm/Hg ( diabetic ) . Measures make six-month interval 18 month ( 4 total measurement ) . We model outcome measure evaluate intervention use mixed effect model dichotomous outcome . Status : Primary study enrollment begin May 5 , 2006 complete November 2007 . We randomize 591 participant study . Baseline recruitment complete November 2007 . Participants ' complete six month follow-up interview June 2008 12 month follow-up December 2008 . 18 month follow-up complete June 2009 . Study grant extension complete two goal : 1 ) investigate sustainability BP control completion intervention , , 2 ) examine aspects intervention work work use qualitative interview . Background/Rationale : Despite impact hypertension availability well-defined therapy widely accept target value blood pressure ( BP ) , intervention improve BP control limit success . Objectives : The study one first compare three intervention design improve BP control : behavioral educational intervention , evidence-based medication management intervention , combine intervention patient poor BP control define home BP monitoring . We receive 11 month extension evaluate 3 key component study ( sustainability BP effect , qualitative evaluation intervention , evaluation support material use ensure literacy level cultural sensitivity . ) Methods : A 4-arm randomized trial 18-month follow-up . Patents select primary care clinic Durham VA Medical Center . Of eligible patient , 591 individual randomize either usual care one three telephone-based intervention group . The intervention phone call trigger base home BP value transmit via telemonitoring device . Patients instructed take BP three time week transmit study team . Behavioral management involve promote health behavior . Medication management involve adjustment hypertension medication study physician nurse base hypertension treatment guideline . The primary outcome change BP control measure six-month interval 18 month . For sustainability extension study , additional collection BP value , use qualitative analysis examine audio interview . Status : Sustainability phase recruitment begin May 1 , 2010 end Aug 15 , 2010 . Analyses continue .</detailed_description>
