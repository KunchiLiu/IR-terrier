	<detailed_description>Objectives : To compare efficacy Leukine Neupogen treatment patient receive cisplatin gemcitabine regionally advance metastatic urothelial cancer regard reduction grade 3 4 neutropenia . Secondary objective include comparison : hematologic non-hematologic toxicity , anti-tumor effect , dose intensity , quality life treatment arm . Methodology : The study multi-institutional , randomize , phase III study patient regionally advance metastatic urothelial cancer . All patient receive chemotherapy cisplatin plus gemcitabine six 21-day cycle . Patients receive hematopoietic growth factor support either Leukine ( Arm A ) , Neupogen ( Arm B ) . Rates anti-tumor response incidence toxicity treatment arm provide comparison efficacy safety hematopoietic support regimen . Patient Population : Patients enrol ( n=100 ) study receive diagnosis regionally advance metastatic urothelial cancer bladder , ureter , renal pelvis undergone previous systemic chemotherapy . Approximately 50 patient enrol treatment arm . Main Criteria Inclusion : Inclusion criterion study specify patient evaluable , biopsy-proven , surgically unresectable , regionally advanced , metastatic urothelial cancer bladder , ureter , renal pelvis . Additionally , patient must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2 adequate bone marrow , renal , hepatic function . Patients undergone previous systemic chemotherapy exclude study . Test Product , Dose , Mode Administration : All patient receive chemotherapeutic treatment cisplatin ( 70 mg/kg ) intravenously Day 1 gemcitabine ( 1000 mg/m2 ) intravenously Days 1 , 8 , 15 21-day cycle . Patients randomize receive either Leukine ( 250 µg/m2 ) Neupogen ( 5 µg/kg ) subcutaneously Days 2-6 , 9-13 , 16-20 cycle . Duration Treatment : Patients receive maximum six 21-day cycle treatment . The overall trial , include follow-up , expect 3 year duration . Criteria Evaluation : Efficacy assess , incidence grade 3 4 toxicity , evaluation complete partial response , time progression , overall disease specific survival , plan v administer dos , quality life . Safety assess , vital sign , physical examination , clinical laboratory evaluation , report adverse event .</detailed_description>
