	<brief_title>Brain Coordination Changes Induced By Robotics FES Treatment Following Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods . Up ninety-six chronic stroke subject ( &gt; 12 month post stroke ) randomize one treatment group : Wrist/hand Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) +whole arm motor learn group ; shoulder/elbow robotics + whole arm motor learn group ; whole arm motor learn group . For group , treatment offer 5 hrs/day , 5 days/week , 12 week . All three treatment group receive motor learn therapy . For Wrist/hand FES+whole arm motor learn group , addition FES treatment . For Shoulder/elbow robotics + whole arm motor learn group addition robotics training . Outcome measure collect week 1 , 6 , 12 , three month end treatment . Measures include muscle strength ( Manual Muscle Testing ) ; coordination joint movement ( Fugl-Meyer Coordination Scale ) ; motor control target acquisition , pathway maintenance ; smoothness movement ( robotics measure ) ; performance 13 functional task ( Arm Motor Ability Test ) ; quality life ( Stroke Impact Scale ) . Measures brain function non-invasive include cognitive planning time , cognitive effort level , location brain activity simple shoulder arm movement . Changes brain function measure reflect plasticity adaptability response treatment .</detailed_description>
