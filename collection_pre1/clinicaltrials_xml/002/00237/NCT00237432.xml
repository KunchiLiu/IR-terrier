	<brief_title>Study Immune Response Hepatitis C Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infect approximately 200 million people worldwide . About 30 % infected individual require treatment clear virus , remainder become chronically infected HCV . Both resolution protection correlate presence HCV-specific T cell response . The researcher believe dendritic cell ( DCs ) play role determine T-cells respond virus . They believe virus able modify function cell cause inactivation T cell would otherwise react virus . By characterize phenotype function DCs patient spontaneously resolve infection patient become chronically infected investigator hope learn pathogenesis HCV . People interested participate study complete history general medical examination begin study . Testing communicable disease , include hepatitis B , syphilis HIV do . If disease find inform offer counsel . Following screening , procedure call leukapheresis , white blood cell remove , red blood cell return . The procedure take approximately 3 hour similar blood donation . The leukapheresis do day admission hospital outside blood collection company train nurse certified equipment . Some aspect study experimental mean fluid cell collect studied analyzed determine precisely body 's immune system respond virus . These test experimental part usual routine care patient .</detailed_description>
