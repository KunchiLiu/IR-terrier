	<brief_summary>The cause interstitial cystitis unknown . However , tends run family suggest may genetic susceptibility disease . For instance , disease find 17 time commonly first-degree relative ( parent , sibling , child ) patient interstitial cystitis general population . Furthermore , one twin interstitial cystitis , disease much common identical co-twins fraternal co-twins . This evidence suggest , family , gene make person susceptible interstitial cystitis pass one generation next . The University Maryland School Medicine National Institutes Health perform study identify gene susceptibility interstitial cystitis . This study entitle Maryland Genetics Interstitial Cystitis ( MaGIC ) study . The MaGIC study investigate several hundred family two blood relative interstitial cystitis . The study seek find change gene find far commonly family member interstitial cystitis disease.Identifying gene lead well understanding cause interstitial cystitis . Finding cause first step find cure . This national study conduct telephone mail , participate entirely home .</brief_summary>
