Current therapy AS mainly NSAIDs physiotherapy oft insufficient . Treatment TNF-alpha blocking agent infliximab show definite clinical efficacy patient active AS short- long-term-basis 2 year . We want show treatment infliximab long-term basis 4 year safe efficient prevent radiographic progression long period time .

	<detailed_description>Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) chronic inflammatory disease unknown etiology involve sacroiliac joint , axial skeleton , entheses peripheral joint . Chronic inflammation entheses lead new bone formation , syndesmophytes ankylosis joint , primarily axial skeleton . This lead dramatic loss range motion disability . The disease may also nonskeletal manifestation include uveitis , carditis , pulmonary fibrosis cardiac conduction abnormality . Current therapy AS mainly NSAIDs physiotherapy often insufficient . Clinical outcome conventional therapy good , 50-70 % patient progress fusion spine 10 15 year . Treatment TNF-alpha blocking agent infliximab show definite clinical efficacy patient active ankylose spondylitis short- long-term basis 2 year . There limited data available efficacy safety long-term anti-TNF therapy 3 year , outcome discontinuation anti-TNF therapy effect anti-TNF therapy radiographic progression long period time . The ASSERT trial 2 year international randomize placebo control trial evaluate efficacy safety ot treatment infliximab patient active severe AS . The EASIC trial initiate follow European participant ASSERT trial least additional 2 year treatment combine systematic data collection .</detailed_description>
