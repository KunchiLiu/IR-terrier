	<detailed_description>This study design demonstrate safety efficacy use protective device/drug prevent renal injury renal artery stenting ( RAS ) ass whether preventative effect measurable , differential treatment effect either device alone combination . Specific goal study include : - To establish device drug safety - To identify appropriate marker renal injury - To measure effectiveness drug device - To enable design FDA efficacy trial renal artery stenting inclusive device drug The study address four follow hypothesis : - AngioGuard™ distal protection device provide significant protection atheroembolization RAS procedure measure affected kidney GFR 1 month procedure . - Abciximab ( ReoPro ) offer protection platelet aggregation embolization measure affected kidney GFR 1 month procedure . - AngioGuard™ Abciximab safe , alone combination . - Is interaction effect AngioGuard™ ReoPro efficacy safety ?</detailed_description>
