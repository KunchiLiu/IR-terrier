	<brief_summary>In patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , disease cause nonsense mutation ( premature stop codon ) gene make cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( CFTR ) protein . PTC124 show partially restore CFTR production animal CF due nonsense mutation . The main purpose study understand whether PTC124 safely increase functional CFTR protein cell patient CF due nonsense mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PTC124 Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , patient CF due nonsense mutation treat new investigational drug call PTC124 . Evaluation procedure ( history , physical examination , blood urine test assess organ function , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , chest x-ray , CF-specific test ) determine patient qualifies study perform within 21 day prior start treatment . Eligible patient elect enroll study participate two 28-day treatment follow-up period ( 56 day total ) . Within first 28-day period , PTC124 treatment take 3 time per day meal 14 day dose 4 mg/kg ( breakfast ) , 4 mg/kg ( lunch ) 8 mg/kg ( dinner ) ; interval 14 day without treatment . Within second 28-day period , PTC124 treatment take 3 time per day meal 14 day dose 10 mg/kg ( breakfast ) , 10 mg/kg ( lunch ) 20 mg/kg ( dinner ) ; interval 14 day without treatment . There 2-night stay clinical research center begin end 14 day PTC124 treatment , mean four 2-night stay clinical research center study . During study , PTC124 efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetics evaluate periodically measurement transepithelial potential difference ( TEPD ) , nasal mucosal brush assess cellular CFTR mRNA protein , medical history , physical examination , blood test , urinalysis , ECGs , chest x-ray , pulmonary function test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis CF base document evidence conclusively abnormal sweat test ( sweat chloride &gt; 60 mEq/liter ) . Abnormal chloride secretion measure TEPD ( less 5 mV TEPD assessment chloride secretion chloridefree amiloride isoproterenol ) . Presence nonsense mutation one alleles CFTR gene . Age ≥18 year . Body weight ≥40 kg . FEV1 ≥40 % predicted age , gender , height ( Knudson standard ) . Oxygen saturation ( measure pulse oximetry ) ≥92 % room air . Willingness male female patient , surgically sterile , abstain sexual intercourse employ barrier medical method contraception study drug administration followup period . Negative pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential ) . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , drug administration plan , study procedure , study restriction . Ability provide write informed consent . Prior ongoing medical condition , medical history , physical finding , ECG finding , laboratory abnormality , investigator 's opinion , could adversely affect safety patient , make unlikely course treatment followup would complete , could impair assessment study result . Ongoing acute illness include acute upper low respiratory infection within 2 week start study treatment . History major complication lung disease within 2 month prior start study treatment . Abnormalities screen chest xray suggest clinically significant active pulmonary disease CF , new , significant abnormality may indicative clinically significant active pulmonary involvement secondary CF . Positive hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody test , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) test . Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL . Serum albumin &lt; 2.5 g/dL . Abnormal liver function ( serum ALT , AST , GGT , alkaline phosphatase , LDH , total bilirubin &gt; upper limit normal ) . Abnormal renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ) . Pregnancy breastfeed . History solid organ hematological transplantation . Exposure another investigational drug within 14 day prior start study treatment . Ongoing participation therapeutic clinical trial . Ongoing use thiazolidinedione peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma ( PPAR γ ) agonists , eg , rosiglitazone ( Avandia® equivalent ) pioglitazone ( Actos® equivalent ) Change intranasal medication ( include use corticosteroid , cromolyn , ipratropium bromide , phenylephrine , oxymetazoline ) within 14 day prior start study treatment . Change treatment systemic inhale corticosteroid within 14 day prior start study treatment . Use requirement inhale gentamicin amikacin within 14 day prior start study treatment study treatment . Requirement systemic aminoglycoside antibiotic within 14 day prior start study treatment .</criteria>
