	<detailed_description>Pneumonia lead cause death hospital-acquired infection . Intubation mechanical ventilation greatly increase risk bacterial ventilator associate pneumonia . Growth potentially pathogenic bacteria dental plaque critically ill patient provide nidus infection microorganism show responsible development Ventilator Associated Pneumonia . Since organisms concentrated dental plaque , removal organisms oral cavity oral care intervention theoretically attractive method reduce risk development Ventilator Associated Pneumonia . However , evidence-based protocol oral care mechanically ventilate patient available . Results study potential improve nursing care , positively affect patient well-being , morbidity , mortality , health care cost .</detailed_description>
