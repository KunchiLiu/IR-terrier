	<detailed_description>Prematurity-associated respiratory failure grow public health problem . Although mortality drop advance perinatal care , condition consumes considerable healthcare resource increasingly associate worrisome long-term morbidity , developmental delay , family burden . Inhaled nitric oxide ( iNO ) , selective pulmonary vasodilator improve short-term outcome term neonates respiratory failure , may benefit premature infant . Consequently , NHLBI-funded randomize control trial ( iNO RCT- NHLBI U01 HL064857 ) assess effect iNO combine end-point mortality oxygen dependency 36 week post conceptional age 800 infant prematurity-associated respiratory failure . However , prematurity-associated respiratory failure different etiology respiratory failure term infant wide array long-term consequence may affect iNO capture exist study design . We therefore extend enhance follow-up NHLBI iNO RCT . Specifically , assess effect INO use : # 1 . - long-term clinical childhood developmental outcomes ; # 2 . - family burden , ; # 3 . - healthcare cost prematurity-associated respiratory failure . Under aim # 4 , use data aim # 1-3 assess cost-effectiveness iNO ventilate premature infant . We achieve aim augment NHLBI iNO RCT data collection : . ) survival follow-up average 4 1/2 year ; ii . ) comprehensive , standardize follow-up clinic visit 1 , 2 , 3 4 1/2 year assess clinical outcome , childhood development , family burden ; iii . ) structure telephone interview parent every 3 month year 1 every 6 month thereafter average 4Â½ year assess chronic morbidity post-discharge healthcare use ; iv . ) collection detailed hospital bill primary hospitalization , ; v. ) comprehensive analysis plan . This study allow u determine long-term consequence iNO therapy condition , aid clinician , family , policymakers immediately affect care critically ill infant . By combine NHLBI iNO RCT , take advantage important opportunity gather prospective long-term outcome data randomize fashion . Our proposal significantly increase return investment RCT great understanding impact iNO therapy societal perspective . Neonatal intensive care change dramatically last ten year . This study also provide contemporary information long-term outcome prematurity-associated respiratory failure follow modern management . Finally , data allow assessment robustness early proxy subsequent outcomes , key future study design area .</detailed_description>
