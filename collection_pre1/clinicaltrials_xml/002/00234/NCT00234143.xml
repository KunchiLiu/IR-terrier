	<brief_summary>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acquire clonal disorder bone marrow . The clinical consequence MDS bone marrow failure predisposition develop acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) . Patients 'low risk MDS ' less 10 % myeloblast marrow include World Health Organization ( WHO ) subtypes refractory anaemia ( RA ) , refractory anaemia ring sideroblast ( RARS ) refractory anaemia excess blasts-I ( RAEB-I ) . This group patient relatively low risk leukaemic transformation major clinical problem manifestation bone marrow failure . Up 80 % patient become red cell transfusion dependent . To date , curative therapy allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Unfortunately , median age diagnosis &gt; 65 year exclude type therapy patient MDS . The aim treatment , therefore , supportive therapy . Long term red cell transfusion therapy carry problem acute transfusion reaction : iron overload , alloantibody formation , poor venous access risk transfusion transmit infection . With time , patient require increase frequency transfusion obtain decreased length benefit transfusion . The quality life patient significantly reduce . Alternative therapy , therefore , aim promote effective haemopoiesis reduce need red cell transfusion may improve quality life , reduce use expensive resource red cell iron chelation , perhaps enhance survival . Combined darbepoetin alfa ( Aranesp ) plus G-CSF ( Neupogen ; filgrastim ) low risk MDS well best supportive care , respect haemoglobin quality life . The study ass : - cost approach - long-term outcome - clinical/laboratory parameter allow early cessation therapy patient destine respond</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : - To compare Quality Life Low-risk MDS patient randomise receive prolonged treatment EPO alone , EPO G-CSF best supportive care alone . Secondary objective : - To compare haemoglobin response transfusion requirement patient arm . - To compare economics cost treat patient arm , order derive cost : benefit analysis . - To assess utility prognostic factor predictive factor assessment , particular predictive model propose Hellstrom-Lindberg . STUDY DESIGN : This trial multi-centre , randomise , triple arm , open-label trial EPO alone ( best supportive care ) , EPO plus G-CSF ( best supportive care ) best supportive care patient low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome symptomatic anaemia and/or red cell transfusion dependence . Screening procedure take place within 42 day randomisation . Patients randomise 1:1:1 ratio EPO best supportive care , EPO G-CSF best supportive care , best supportive care . Patients randomised drug therapy arm receive EPO subcutaneously every fortnight ± G-CSF least weekly , together red cell transfusion supportive care require . Patients randomise `` best supportive care '' receive red cell transfusion supportive care require . Study visit select study investigation occur every 4 week first 24 week , 36 52 week . Quality life ( FACT-An EQ-5D ) measure use arm study . Analysis &amp; Reporting : Data analyse reported endpoint final patient complete 52 week follow-up . Data Monitoring Committee : An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) ensure safety patient enrol trial . This group MRC Leukaemia LDMEC ( Chair : Prof. Gordon Murray ) . The DMC meet commencement recruitment formulate guideline safety efficacy monitoring . The DMC provide report meeting TSC . The DMC meet least annually frequently need . Central Morphology Review : Bone marrow biopsies/aspirates patient sent central morphology review determine eligibility study . All screen aspirate biopsy review centrally confirm diagnosis MDS categorisation WHO/FAB subtype . On-study end study bone marrows also review . In addition , centralise test specialist investigation perform . STUDY ENDPOINTS : Primary end point : - Quality life 24 week ( FACT-An &amp; EQ-5D - latter use health economic analysis ) Secondary end point : - Quality life 12 , 36 52 week ( FACT-An &amp; EQ-5D ) - Overall erythroid response ( major minor ) 24 week ( main analysis point ) also 12 52 week , define International Working Group ( IWG ) criteria - Incidence disease progression ( i.e . RAEB AML ) - Overall survival - Economic cost manage anaemia arm study . STUDY DURATION : Patients monitor study endpoint 52 week . Patients respond EPO ± G-CSF remain therapy 52 week . Beyond 52 week , patient follow indefinitely order assess duration response , incidence disease progression overall survival ( Office National Statistics ) . TOTAL SAMPLE SIZE : Three hundred &amp; sixty ( 360 ) patient , one hundred &amp; twenty ( 120 ) arm . DOSING REGIMEN : The treatment schedule use concept 'frontloading ' give patient high dos EPO start therapy order induce response quickly possible . The long-acting nature darbepoetin alpha avoids excessive frequency injection , allow delivery high dos EPO . At week 24 , response achieve , study treatment deem fail stopped patient receive 'best supportive care ' . Darbepoetin ( 120 patient ) : - EPO ( Aranesp® ) 500 mcg s.c. every 2 week . 1 . If rapid response obtain ( Hb increase &gt; = 2 g/dl 4 week period ) , titrate dose frequency EPO . 2 . If major response , titrate EPO low dose frequency maintain response . - At 24 week : 1 . If response , stop EPO give supportive therapy . 2 . If minor response , continue EPO 500 mcg every 2 week s.c. 3 . If major response , titrate EPO low dose frequency maintain response . Darbepoetine Filgrastim ( 120 patient ) : - G-CSF ( Neupogen® ) 300 mcg s.c. twice week , 3-4 day apart . - EPO ( Aranesp® ) 500 mcg s.c. every 2 week . 1 . If rapid response obtain ( Hb increase &gt; = 2 g/dl 4 week period ) , titrate dose frequency EPO . 2 . If major response , titrate EPO G-CSF low dose frequency maintain response . - At 24 week : 1 . If response , stop EPO G-CSF give supportive therapy . 2 . If minor response , continue EPO 500 mcg every 2 week s.c. G-CSF 300 mcg s.c. twice week , 3-4 day apart . 3 . If major response , titrate EPO G-CSF low dose frequency maintain response . Best Supportive Care ( 120 patient ) : Patients randomise growth factor treatment receive best supportive care , define : - Red cell transfusion support achieve predict post-transfusion haemoglobin 11.0 12.0 g/dl quantity &amp; frequency trough haemoglobin never &lt; 8.0 g/dl OR - patient never excessively symptomatic , accord local transfusion guidelines/policy . STUDY DRUG SUPPLIES : Darbepoetin ( Aranesp® ) pre-filled syrinx 500 mcg filgrastim ( Neupogen® ) pre-filled syrinx 300 mcg supply Amgen ( UK ) provide free charge . SAFETY ASSESSMENTS : - Vital sign - Physical examination - Clinical laboratory assessment - Concomitant medication - Adverse event EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS : - Quality life assessment - Number frequency red cell transfusion - Clinical laboratory assessment - Bone marrow aspirate assessment</detailed_description>
