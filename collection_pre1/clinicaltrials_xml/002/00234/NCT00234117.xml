	<brief_title>Improvement Bronchial Asthma Patients With Extraesophageal Reflux After Acid Suppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease consider role course asthma , show improvement symptom adequate acid suppression therapy . It important consider establish presence GERD patient asthma specially , fail respond conventional asthma management . It believe two mechanism may play role association Bronchial Asthma GERD , commonly microaspiration acid cause bronchoconstriction , second increase vagal tone . Establishing adequate timely diagnosis confirm exclude relationship two entity asthmatic patient first step towards effective patient management . The next important consideration establish correct acid suppression therapy monitoring response therapy objective test Pulmonary Function Testing ( PFT ) esophageal pH testing . Since real `` normal '' physiologic reflux measure patient extresophageal manifestation see patient `` classic '' reflux total time exposure acid ( pH &lt; 4 ) less 5 % consider normal , patient necessary establish strict pH control classic GERD . Achieving complete acid control population expect require high dos medication use patient classic reflux extraesophageal manifestation . Thus develop study assess response 20 mg BID dose Rabeprazole measure pH monitoring follow improvement Pulmonary Function Testing ( objective measure ) , well symptomatic response .</detailed_description>
