	<brief_summary>The hypothesis test position change withdrawal phase colonoscopy lead high adenoma ( polyp ) detection rate well distension colon . Since adenomas precancerous lesion enhance adenoma detection increase success colorectal cancer screen programme . This study provide evidence value position change encourage endoscopist adopt position change routine practice . May 2007 : protocol amendment include additional prospective analysis use High Definition TV ( HDTV ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adenoma Detection Rate With Position Change Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer second commonest cause cancer death . In majority case precede precancerous lesion call adenoma ( commonly know polyp ) . Detection removal adenoma colonoscopy show reduce mortality colorectal cancer . The success impend colorectal cancer screen programme reduce cancer mortality average-risk population depend optimal adenoma detection colonoscopy . The detection adenomas show vary different endoscopist . Some factor report affect adenoma detection rate include time spend viewing , adequacy bowel preparation time spend clean colonic mucosa excess fluid . Careful examination proximal side flexure , fold valve endoscopist equally important . However , even careful examination adenoma detection rate show vary endoscopist 8.6 % 15.9 % . Previous experience training may contribute difference . Some endoscopist adopt regular change position procedure maximize distension colon . Better luminal distension enhances mucosal view detection small adenoma . The validity approach never test propose factor may contribute difference adenoma detection rate . Patients randomise either position 1 first position 2 vice versa examine twice . During one withdrawal colon examine participant leave lateral position ( position 1 ) position change ( position 2 ) vice versa . May 2007 : protocol amendment include additional prospective analysis use High Definition TV ( HDTV ) . No patient data collection involve .</detailed_description>
