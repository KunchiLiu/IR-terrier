	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) common inflammatory rheumatic disease characterize joint inflammation ( clinical involvement ) , osteo-cartilaginous lesion ( structural damage ) generally bone involvement . All feature lead great disability . Because represent major problem public health care system , RA select one main objective government next five year . RA patient respond DMARDs require treatment TNF-a blocking agent . However , information available predict clinical , structural bone responses new drug responsible severe side-effects . Moreover , particularly expensive since yearly cost estimate 75000 112500 k euro G4 region . The purpose present research project determine potential predictive factor response new TNF-a blocker ie adalimumab . To address question , several investigation perform include measurement different blood marker , particularly bone marker , well-defined autoantibody new autoantibody population identify proteomic analysis , large-scale analysis gene expression cDNA array blood mononuclear cell , use different imaging tool . The criteria judgement clinical , structural bone responses new agent . This study require recruitment 100 patient receive adalimumab 1-year period . At end study , hope identify predictive factor response adalimumab , lead good management TNF-a blocker . Indeed , prescribe patient likely respond drug . Thus , study allow elaborate theranostic algorithm . Such approach great benefit patient : rapid efficacy , less severe side-reactions low cost .</brief_summary>
