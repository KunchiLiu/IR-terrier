	<brief_summary>We conduct randomize control trial adjuvant interferon therapy patient predominantly hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) investigate whether prognosis hepatic resection could improve . Since February 1999 , patient residual disease hepatic resection HCC randomly assign stratification pTNM stage receive treatment ( control group ) , interferon alpha-2b 10 MIU/m2 ( IFN-I group ) 30 MIU/m2 ( IFN-II group ) thrice weekly 16 week . Enrollment IFN-II group terminate January 2000 adverse effect result treatment discontinuation first 6 patient . By June 2002 , 40 patient enrol control group IFN-I group . The baseline clinical , laboratory tumor characteristic group comparable . The 1- 5-year survival rate 85 % 61 % , respectively control group 97 % 79 % , respectively IFN-I group ( P=0.137 ) . After adjust confound prognostic factor Cox model , relative risk death interferon treatment 0.42 ( 95 % CI 0.17 - 1.05 ; P=0.063 ) . Exploratory subset analysis show adjuvant interferon survival benefit pTNM stage I/II tumor ( 5-year survival 90 % group ; P=0.917 ) prevent early recurrence improve 5-year survival patient stage III/IVA tumor 24 % 68 % ( P=0.038 ) . In conclusion , group patient predominantly hepatitis B-related HCC , adjuvant interferon therapy prevent early recurrence improve survival pTNM stage III/IVA tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Background Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) second common cause cancer death Hong Kong majority hepatitis B relate . Hepatic resection remain therapeutic option offer patient chance long-term survival . Although safety hepatectomy improve , postoperative recurrence frequent . Depending size primary tumor , recent report Japan , France Hong Kong1 show postoperative recurrence rate 20 64 % one year 57 81 % 3 year . While hepatic remnant predominant site recurrence , involvement extrahepatic organ infrequent . There three possible mechanism development recurrent disease : ) residual tumor cell due inadequate resection margin ii ) subclinical metastasis occur hepatic resection iii ) metachronous multicentric hepatocarcinogenesis may relate underlie necroinflammation chronic active hepatitis oncogenic activity hepatitis virus . The surgeon 's attempt prevent recurrence extensive resection prohibit need preserve hepatic function . Futhermore , even major hepatic resection guarantee freedom recurrence since metachronous multicentric tumor develop entire liver . Theorectically , total hepatectomy liver transplantation remove subclinical metastasis liver prevent metachronous lesion . Unfortunately , immunosuppressive therapy , recurrence frequent tumor grow rapidly , thus , illustrate importance host immune surveillance prevent development recurrence . The use postoperative regional systemic chemotherapy report . Although retrospective study show encouraging result , limited number prospective trial . The favourable result use oral 1-hexylcarbomyl-5-fluorouracil multi-center trial report Yamamoto colleague questionable since treatment suspend due side-effects 44 % patient . Our single-center prospective randomise study perform Queen Mary Hospital ( QMH ) use combination transarterial chemoembolisation systemic epirubicin show higher extrahepatic recurrence rate bad outcome use adjuvant chemotherapy . The reason failure adjuvant chemotherapy include : ) HCC slow-growing hence cytotoxic drug resistant . ii ) associate liver cirrhosis limit maximum tolerated intensity chemotherapy iii ) anticancer agent may adversely affect host immunity 2 . Interferon alpha-2b Interferon alpha-2b recombinant form human interferon . Interferons cytokine possess anti-viral , anti-proliferative immunodulatory effect . Interferon may halt replication hepatitis B hepatitis C virus , thus , reduce severity chronic active hepatitis . The histologic activity chronic active hepatitis important risk factor recurrence relate metachronous multicentric hepatocarcinogenesis use interferon show reduce incidence HCC patient cirrhosis due hepatitis C possibly hepatitis B. Interferon powerful anti-proliferative effect hepatoma cell-line PLC/PRF/5 dose-dependent manner in-vitro in-vivo . The use interferon apply patient inoperable HCC tumour regression rate survival rate superior placebo-control chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell patient HCC considerably reduce cytotoxicity hepatoma cell line . Interferon show normalise T-lymphocyte subpopullation enhance cytotoxic activity HBsAg-producing hepatoma cell line in-vitro . 3 . Interferon adverse effect Interferon alpha-2b register treatment HCC chronic hepatitis B Hong Kong . In patient unresectable HCC , interferon much low incidence fatal side-effects compare doxorubicin . Most patient experience flu-like symptom include fever , headache , fatigue myalgia usually subside spontaneously continuation treatment . Less common serious adverse effect include alopecia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , depression , irritability , mental deterioration . The adverse effect dose-dependent majority reversible reduction dosage . The use high-dose interferon well-tolerated clinical trial involve patient unresectable HCC . 4 . Rationale Interferon anti-viral , anti-proliferative immunodulatory activity . It use clinically treatment unresectable HCC well viral hepatitis B C. It potentially reduce incidence recurrence due residual tumour cell metachronous multicentric disease patient resection HCC .</detailed_description>
