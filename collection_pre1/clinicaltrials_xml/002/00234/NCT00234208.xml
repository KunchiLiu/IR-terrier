	<brief_title>Early Medical Thoracoscopy Versus Simple Chest Tube Drainage Complicated Parapneumonic Effusion Pleural Empyema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Pleural empyema high morbidity mortality . Until clear method best initially drain pu , especially complicate effusion septa . The objective study compare standard treatment simple chest tube drainage early mini-invasive medical thoracoscopy . In early study medical thoracoscopy safe effective method pleural disease . However prospective data available . Methods We conduct prospective randomize control multicenter study 100 patient complicate parapneumonic effusion septa empyema frank pu . Patients randomize receive either simple chest tube drainage early medical thoracoscopy . The latter perform local anaesthesia analgosedation accord standard set European Study Medical Video-Assisted Thoracoscopy ( ESMEVAT ) -group . Fibrinolysis use routinely . In 20 patient nest study intrapleural pharmacokinetics linezolid antibiotic agent perform . Follow-up structured day 1 , day 7 , discharge 3 month include chest radiograph clinical laboratory evaluation . Outcome Primary outcome medical cure without need secondary intervention death . As secondary outcome measure duration hospital stay , adverse event . Provisional agenda Start study : October 2005 End study : October 2007 Potential outcome &amp; benefit The study clarify role early medical thoracoscopy patient complicate parapneumonic effusion pleural empyema . Different author speculate early intervention could preferable . On hand , many centre worldwide patient primarily treat simple chest tube without pleural fibrinolysis . In case failure simple drainage , mean several `` precious '' day later , invasive procedure need . At moment tight pleural septum form , often surgical VATS thoracotomy general anaesthesia become necessary . Therefore , pivotal study could lead change management patient pleural empyema .</detailed_description>
