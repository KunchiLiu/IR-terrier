	<brief_title>Study Economics Pulmonary Artery Catheter Use Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC ) commonly used device provide hemodynamic data guide care critically ill , patient acute lung injury acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS/ALI ) . Clinicians believe PAC use improve decision-making patient outcome evidence lack recent data suggest PAC may increase mortality well considerably increase cost . In response , NHLBI fund large multicenter trial ( Fluid And Catheter Treatment Trial ( FACTT ) ( N01-HR-46054-46064 ) ) ARDS/ALI patient randomize receive PAC less invasive central venous catheter ( CVC ) receive liberal conservative fluid management protocol response data provide PAC CVC . The primary end-point in-patient mortality . We complement FACTT concurrent economic analysis PAC . Our aim : 1 . ) compare difference study arm long-term survival , quality life , quality-adjusted survival ; 2 . ) compare difference study arm acute care long-term cost ; 3 . ) calculate cost-efficacy PAC use ( i.e. , balance cost effect control environment FACTT trial ) , ; 4 . ) estimate cost-effectiveness `` real-world '' condition produce life-time cost-effectiveness ratio , thereby facilitate comparison result cost-effectiveness analysis . We achieve Aims 1-3 augment FACTT data collection detail information hospital cost , extend survival follow-up minimum one year , post-discharge patient interview determine quality life resource use first year . We achieve Aim 4 construct microsimulation model first calibrate result FACTT publish data life-expectancy cost adjust reflect broad patient case-mix clinical effect PAC use routine clinical practice . We use patient-level data King County Lung Injury Project epidemiology study ( NHLBI HL-96-014 ) adjust case-mix patient-level data large pragmatic trial PAC use United Kingdom adjust clinical effect PAC use . The result adjunct FACTT substantially amplify value data collect provide , first time , robust estimate randomize data economic effect widespread application important technology .</detailed_description>
