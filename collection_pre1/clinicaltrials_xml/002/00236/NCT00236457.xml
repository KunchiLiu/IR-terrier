Patients assess maintenance efficacy , safety , resource use Week 52 ( second part study ) . Efficacy assessment include Structured Clinical Interview - Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( SCI-PANSS ) , overall severity illness measure Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) scale , quality life assess Wisconsin Quality Life Index ( W-QOLI ) . Safety evaluation include incidence adverse event , Simpson Angus Rating Scale extrapyramidal symptom , physical examination , clinical laboratory test ( biochemistry , haematology , urinalysis ) , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) . The primary study hypothesis treatment long-acting risperidone inject intramuscularly every 2 week inferior treatment daily olanzapine term short-term efficacy well tolerated patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . Risperidone injection ( 25mg 50mg ) every 2 week 12 month . Investigator may decrease increase dosage ( max 50mg ) supplement risperidone injection risperidone tablet ( 4mg/day max. ) .
