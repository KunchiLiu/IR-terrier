Opioid tolerant patient define patient take least 1 mg/kg/day 40mg/day oral morphine ( equianalgesic dosage another opioid ) least 25 mcg/hour transdermal fentanyl least 7 day . ( ATC opioid therapy may administer patient control analgesia [ PCA ] ) . The child must experience episode BTP ( define transient flare pain require bolus medication treatment ) follow : Patients cancer must experience average least 1 BTP episode day Patients noncancer related pain must experience average 2 BTP episode day Girls postmenarch sexually active must negative urine pregnancy test entry study , must use medically acceptable method birth control , must agree continue use method duration study ( 30 day participation study ) . Acceptable method birth control include : barrier method spermicide ; steroidal contraceptive ( eg , oral , transdermal , implanted , inject ) conjunction barrier method ; intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; abstinence The child , opinion investigator , able administer ACTIQ treatment effectively ( ie , adequately move unit around mouth suck bite unit ) The child may inpatient outpatient Children exclude participate study 1 follow criterion meet : The child pain uncontrolled therapy , determine investigator , could adversely impact safety patient could compromise treatment ACTIQ . The child know suspected hypersensitivities/allergies contraindication ACTIQ component The child receive monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOIs ) within 14 day first dose study drug administration The child moderate severe oral mucositis The child neuromuscular disease , significant renal impairment , significant hepatic impairment determine investigator The child medical condition receive concomitant medication/therapy would , opinion investigator , compromise patient 's safety compliance study protocol , compromise data collection The child receive experimental drug/therapy .
