During next phase study , patient slowly reduce dose stop take study drug , , patient option take 600 milligram topiramate ( placebo ) 14-week extension study . This study design investigate hypothesis topiramate effective placebo treatment essential tremor measure Clinical Rating Scale Tremor ( TRS ) well tolerate . The TRS three part scale measure tremor location/severity rating , specific motor tasks/function rating , functional disability result tremor . Safety evaluation assess throughout study . Topiramate placebo , start dose 25 mg , gradually increase 12 week 400 mg daily ( two 100-mg tablet take mouth twice day ) continue dose 12 week maintenance phase ; 600 milligram topiramate open-label phase .</detailed_description>
