	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Safety Topiramate Compared With Standard Therapy Patients Newly Diagnosed With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topiramate drug currently widely use treatment seizures adult pediatric patient ( 2 16 year age ) . This randomized , double-blind , parallel-group study evaluate effectiveness safety two dosage topiramate ( 100 200mg per day ) compare standard antiepileptic drug ( carbamazepine valproate ) patient newly diagnose epilepsy . The study compose three phase : baseline ( 7 day ) , double-blind treatment , blind extension . The double-blind phase divide two period : titration , dose drug gradually increase ( approximately 35 day ) , stabilization ( variable duration , regular schedule visit 92 day every 3 month thereafter ) . The dose study drug remain constant stabilization period . In blinded extension , patient complete double blind phase give opportunity take study medication blind fashion ( patient unaware identity drug ) . This phase continue patient leaf study data base double blind phase finalize . The primary assessment effectiveness time first seizure Day 15 study . Safety assessment include frequency adverse event study , result clinical laboratory test ( hematology biochemistry ) , measurement vital sign body weight , physical examination finding . The study hypothesis 200mg dose topiramate superior 100mg dose delay time first seizure well-tolerated . Oral topiramate ( 25milligram [ mg ] 50mg capsule tablet ) , start 25mg/day ( Week 1 ) , increase 100mg 200mg/day ( Week 5 ) .Increasing carbamazepine 600mg/day valproate 1250mg/day ( Week 5 ) .Maximum dosage continue variable time taper 4 week start dose .</detailed_description>
