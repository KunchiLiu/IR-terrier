	<brief_title>A Study Efficacy Safety Topiramate Treatment Obese Patients With Mild Moderate Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topiramate approve treatment obesity . The use topiramate reduce weight obese patient may adjunctive benefit reduce blood pressure subject treat untreated hypertension , background antihypertensive medication . This double-blind , placebo control study investigates long-term efficacy topiramate reduction weight blood pressure obese patient mild-moderate hypertension , safety tolerability topiramate patient population . The study consist 4 phase : 6 week run-in phase ( 2 week screen 4 week single-blind placebo ) , 8 week titration phase ( topiramate group dose increase 16mg/day either 96mg/day 192mg/day ) , 52 week maintenance phase ( patient receive fix dose either topiramate placebo ) 6 week follow-up phase . Beginning enrollment throughout study , subject participate standardized behavioral modification program provide subject lifestyle self-management strategy diet , nutrition physical activity . Effectiveness evaluate multiple measurement change body weight , sit diastolic blood pressure , sit systolic blood pressure , Body Mass Index , number proportion treatment responder , volume leave ventricle heart measure echocardiography , fast lipid profile . Safety evaluation ( incidence severity adverse event , vital sign , 12 lead ECG , clinical laboratory result ) conduct throughout study . The study hypothesis topiramate effective reduce blood pressure obese patient mild moderate hypertension well tolerate . During initial 8 week , dose topiramate placebo gradually increase target dos ( either 48mg twice daily 96mg twice daily mouth ) dose maintain 52 week .</detailed_description>
