	<brief_title>A Study Compare Safety Effectiveness 2 Doses Levofloxacin Given Different Time Periods Patients With Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levofloxacin antibiotic approve FDA treatment sinusitis , chronic bronchitis , skin infection , urinary tract infection , community-acquired pneumonia . This multicenter , double-blind ( neither patient study doctor know dose levofloxacin administer ) study evaluate effectiveness safety two antibiotic regimen treatment community-acquired pneumonia adult patient . A 5-day course 750 milligram levofloxacin give daily compare 10-day course 500 milligram levofloxacin give daily . Patients receive levofloxacin mouth vein depend severity pneumonia . Patients assess 3 day treatment ; treatment discontinue significant improvement note . Patients show sign improvement continue study , assessment study day 12-16 , 17-21 ( posttherapy visit ) , 31-38 ( poststudy visit ) . Effectiveness assess measure ability study drug eliminate bacteria cause pneumonia reduce sign symptom pneumonia . Chest x-rays laboratory test presence bacteria perform study . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , physical examination , laboratory test ) perform throughout study . The study hypothesis levofloxacin administer high dose short duration least effective levofloxacin administer low dose long duration treatment community-acquired pneumonia generally well-tolerated . Levofloxacin , 500 milligram ( mg ) mouth vein daily 10 day 750 mg mouth slowly vein daily 5 day</detailed_description>
