	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Levofloxacin Compared With Imipenem/Cilastatin Patients With Pneumonia Acquired During Hospitalization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advance prevention treatment , hospital-acquired pneumonia remain significant problem second common infection acquire hospital deadly ( 20 % -50 % patient acquire pneumonia hospital die complication pneumonia ) . Levofloxacin show clinical trial effective number different bacteria , include found common uncommon cause pneumonia . This multicenter , open-label study evaluate safety effectiveness levofloxacin compare imipenem/cilastatin , another type antibiotic treatment , patient pneumonia acquire hospital . Patients receive treatment total 7-15 day , initially levofloxacin imipenem/cilastatin , administer slowly vein . If patient respond positively either drug , treatment may change levofloxacin ciprofloxacin ( initially treat imipenem/cilastatin ) , take mouth . Certain additional drug may add needed treat pneumonia cause certain bacteria . Patients show sign improvement continue study , assessment 5-7 day ( posttherapy visit ) 28-32 day completion study drug ( poststudy visit ) . Effectiveness assess measure ability study drug eliminate bacteria cause pneumonia reduce sign symptom pneumonia . Chest x-rays laboratory test bacteria perform throughout study patient ' severity disease rat accord Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) scale . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , physical examination , laboratory test ) perform throughout study . Blood sample draw patient receive levofloxacin determine concentration levofloxacin blood . The study hypothesis levofloxacin least effective imipenem/cilastatin treat hospital-acquired pneumonia generally well-tolerated . Levofloxacin 750 mg administer vein daily imipenem/cilastatin 500mg-1 gram every 6-8 hour . Upon improvement , patient may transition levofloxacin 750mg mouth daily ciprofloxacin 750mg mouth twice daily 7-15 day .</detailed_description>
