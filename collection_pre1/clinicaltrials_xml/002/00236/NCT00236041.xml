	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate efficacy ACTIQ treatment management breakthrough pain ( BTP ) compare placebo treatment child pain receive around-the-clock ( ATC ) opioid therapy require additional therapy BTP episodes . This determined analysis pain intensity ( PI ) , measure Faces Pain Scale-Revised ( FPS-R ) administer 15 minute start unit study drug optimal ACTIQ dosage . The secondary objective : - evaluate characteristic BTP child pain , include response treatment - evaluate efficacy ACTIQ treatment compare placebo treatment child regard time adequate analgesia utilizing stop watch measure time unit study drug double blind phase - evaluate efficacy ACTIQ treatment compare placebo treatment child assess occurrence inadequate analgesia assess use rescue medication - evaluate efficacy ACTIQ treatment compare placebo treatment child assess number patient withdraw study inadequate analgesia - evaluate efficacy ACTIQ treatment compare placebo treatment child assess duration analgesic effect use FPS-R administer approximately 30 , 45 , 60 minute start unit study drug optimal dosage obtain - determine distribution optimal dos ACTIQ treatment child age group ( 3 6 year , 6 11 year , 11 16 year ) - establish safe effective titration scheme ACTIQ child open label phase - evaluate safety ACTIQ treatment child assessment adverse event , clinical laboratory assessment ( serum chemistry hematology ) , vital sign measurement ( include blood pressure , heart rate , respiration rate ) , hemoglobin-oxygen saturation level ( SpO2 , measure via pulse oximetry ) , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , physical examination , level sedation ( measure University Michigan Sedation Scale [ UMSS ] ) - characterize pharmacokinetics profile ACTIQ ( fentanyl citrate ) child - investigate exposure efficacy relationship plasma concentration fentanyl clinical measure analgesia</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent parent legal guardian patient assent , appropriate , obtain . ( Lack assent overturn . ) 2 . The child age 3 16 year weigh least 15 kg . 3 . The child must use ATC opioid therapy pain associated cancer opioidtolerant . NOTE : This requirement define patient receive least 1 mg/kg/day 40 mg/day oral morphine ( equianalgesic dosage another opioid ) least 25 mcg/hour transdermal fentanyl least 7 day , ( ATC opioid therapy may administer patientcontrolled analgesia [ PCA ] ) . 4 . The child must experience episode BTP ( define transient flare pain require bolus medication treatment ) follow : 1. patient cancer must experience average least 1 BTP episode day . 2. patient noncancer related pain must experience average 2 BTP episode day . 5 . The child average daily pain score 6 less ( 10 ) FPSR . 6 . Girls postmenarche sexually active must negative urine pregnancy test prior baseline visit , must use medically acceptable method birth control , must agree continue use method duration study ( 30 day participation study ) . Acceptable method birth control include : barrier method spermicide ; steroidal contraceptive ( eg , oral , transdermal , implanted , inject ) conjunction barrier method ; intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; abstinence . 7 . The child , opinion investigator , able administer ACTIQ treatment effectively ( ie , adequately move unit around mouth sucking , bite , unit ) . 8 . The child must inpatient . 1 . The child pain uncontrolled therapy , determine investigator , could adversely impact safety patient could compromise treatment ACTIQ . 2 . The child know suspected hypersensitivities/allergies contraindication ACTIQ component . 3 . The child receive monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOIs ) within 14 day first ACTIQ treatment . 4 . The child moderate severe oral mucositis . 5 . The child neuromuscular disease , significant renal impairment , significant hepatic impairment determine investigator . 6 . The child medical condition receive concomitant medication/therapy would , opinion investigator , compromise patient 's safety compliance study protocol , compromise data collection . 7 . The child receive experimental drug/therapy within 14 day first ACTIQ treatment . NOTE : Children may participate concurrently another study study require experimental drug therapy . 8 . A child 's exacerbation pain associated medical procedure ( radiation therapy , wound dressing , bone marrow aspiration ) . 9 . The child receive treatment , opinion investigator , could interfere pain response . 10 . For female patient childbearing potential : pregnant lactating . ( Any female patient become pregnant study withdrawn study . ) 11 . The child , opinion investigator , developmental delay would interfere use ACTIQ therapy .</criteria>
