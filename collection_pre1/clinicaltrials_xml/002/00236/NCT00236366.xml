	<brief_title>A Study Effect Pain Control Treatment With Fentanyl , Administered Through Skin , Compared With Placebo Patients With Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic , non-cancer pain may result injury illness , osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis , cause suffer reduction quality life . Opioids , fentanyl , beneficial potent pain-relieving drug patient continuous pain . This double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled study compare pain relief , effect safety , functionality , quality life treatment fentanyl administer skin via adhesive patch ( `` transdermal system '' ) therapy placebo patient osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Specifically , patient moderate severe pain induced osteoarthritis treatment traditional pain medication ( accord World Health Organization [ WHO ] pain ladder , include weak opioids ) fail provide adequate pain relief , eligible enroll . After screen , patient enter 1-week Run-In period , prior treatment weak opioids , without non-opioid pain medication , continue . After period , patient moderate severe pain randomize fentanyl adhesive patch placebo Double-Blind ( Treatment ) phase 6 week . All patient , include discontinue withdraw study , enter Tapering-Off period , medication reduce gradually . Assessments effectiveness include : Pain relief , determine Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) mean electronic pain diary updated patient least twice daily ; functionality , assess Western Ontario McMaster Universities ( WOMAC ) Osteoarthritis Index ; quality life , measure SF-36 Quality Life Questionnaire . Safety assessment include identification possible withdrawal symptom end Tapering-Off period , measurement vital sign state interval , incidence adverse event throughout study . The study hypothesis patient osteoarthritis hip knee whose pain adequately control pain-relieving medication show improvement pain control treatment fentanyl transdermal system . Fentanyl patch deliver 25 micrograms/hour 100 micrograms/hour , change every 3 day , 6 week ; dos may adjust adequate pain control ; anti-nausea tablet ( Metoclopramide , 10 milligram [ mg ] , paracetamol tablet ( 500 mg ; maximum 4 grams/day ) supplementary pain control</detailed_description>
