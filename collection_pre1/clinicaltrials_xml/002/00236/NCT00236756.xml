	<brief_title>A Study Efficacy Safety Topiramate add-on Therapy Treatment Epilepsy Patients With Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lennox-Gastaut syndrome severe form epilepsy usually develop child 4 year age younger . It characterize several seizure type developmental delay . Tonic seizure , muscle tone greatly increase body , arm legs make sudden stiffening movement , particularly common Lennox-Gastaut syndrome . Although atonic seizure , sudden loss muscle tone strength , occur individual syndrome . Control seizures difficult usually resistant antiepileptic drug . Topiramate drug currently widely use treatment seizures adult pediatric patient ( 2 16 year age ) . This randomized , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled study evaluate efficacy safety topiramate add-on therapy patient Lennox-Gastaut syndrome . The study compose two phase : baseline ( 28 day ) double-blind treatment ( approximately 11 week ) . Patients guardians/parents give diary record information seizures occur study . During baseline phase , patient continue receive antiepileptic drug taking . The double-blind phase divide two period : titration , topiramate dose gradually increase ( 21 day ) ( patient 's antiepileptic drug continue ; dose remains ) maintenance ( 56 day ) . The dose topiramate patient 's antiepileptic drug remain constant maintenance period . Based investigator 's judgment , patient complete double-blind period could enrol extension phase study . The primary assessment effectiveness percent reduction baseline seizure rate ( type seizure ) double-blind phase . Safety assessment include frequency adverse event , result clinical laboratory test ( hematology , biochemistry , urinalysis ) , measurement vital sign body weight , physical examination electrocardiogram finding , neurological examination . The study hypothesis topiramate superior placebo reduce seizure rate baseline double blind phase study well tolerate . Topiramate ( 25milligram [ mg ] 100mg tablet ) placebo , take mouth , start dose 1mg/kilogram ( kg ) /day , gradually increase 3 week total dose 6mg/kg/day ( give twice daily equal oral dos 8 week ) . Maximum daily dose &lt; =600mg/day .</detailed_description>
