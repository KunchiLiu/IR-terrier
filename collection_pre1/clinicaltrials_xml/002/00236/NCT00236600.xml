	<brief_title>A Study Efficacy Safety Topiramate Maintaining Weight Loss Obese Patients Following Intensive , Non-Pharmacologic Weight Loss Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although dietary modification couple increased exercise prefer treatment obesity , lifestyle change alone often insufficient achieve maintain weight reduction obese patient . Topiramate approve treatment obesity . This double-blind , placebo control study evaluate effectiveness safety topiramate maintain weight loss achieve intensive non-drug weight reduction program . Enrolled patient undergo run-in phase ( 8 week intensive non-drug weight reduction therapy consist low calorie diet , behavioral modification program , exercise program ) . Those patient achieve weight loss &gt; = 8 % enrollment body weight meet eligibility criterion randomize either 96mg 192mg topiramate , placebo . After 8 week dose titration , patient receive one year treatment . Effectiveness assess body weight , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , number proportion 5 % , 10 % 15 % weight loss responder , number proportion patient maintain 50 % , 75 % , 100 % weight lose run-in phase , waist hip circumference , fast lipid profile , fast plasma glucose , HbA1c , fast insulin , two-hour glucose tolerance test , uric acid level , blood pressure , body composition , echocardiography , Health Related Quality Life score . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , electrocardiogram , vital sign , etc ) perform throughout study . The study hypothesis topiramate effective placebo maintain weight reduction obese patient follow intensive non-drug weight reduction program . During initial 8 week , dos topiramate placebo gradually increase target dos ( either 96mg 192mg ) daily mouth dos maintain one year .</detailed_description>
