	<brief_title>Dipyridamole/Magnesium To Improve Sickle Cell Hydration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaso-occlusive episode common problem experience patient SCA frequent reason hospital admission well visit clinic emergency department . Many cellular , humoral , vascular factor influence initiation propagation vaso-occlusion sickle cell . Among tendency sickle cell ( SS RBC ) become dehydrated accompanying increase hemoglobin ( Hb ) concentration . Since sickle hemoglobin ( Hb S ) concentration control rate polymerization , cellular dehydration play key role sickle cell pathology . Two separate interdependent cation transport mechanism affect sickle cell hydration , first involve abnormal KCl cotransport ( KCC ) , second sickle-induced ( SI ) passive leak permit influx calcium ion ( Ca++ ) activate Gardos pathway , Ca++-dependent K channel . Early investigation aim inhibit KCC magnesium ( Mg ) Gardos pathway clotrimazole meet partial success . We recently show vitro dipyridamole also inhibit SI pathway . Strategies design block formation dense , dehydrated cell would offer important therapeutic option might decrease number severity vaso-occlusive episode patient . Drawing information gain two decade research cation transport SS RBC , include unique discovery make Center dipyridamole inhibits SI cation leak , propose study combine therapy use two transport inhibitor aim reduce SS RBC dehydration .</detailed_description>
