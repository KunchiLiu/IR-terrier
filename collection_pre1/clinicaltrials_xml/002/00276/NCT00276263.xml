	<brief_title>Sarcosine Preventive Therapy Individuals At High Risk Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia neurodevelopmental disorder affect approximately 1 % general population continue one major challenge modern medicine due tremendous human suffer economic cost involve . Once diagnosis schizophrenia relate chronic psychosis make , majority patient partially respond presently available pharmacological treatment afflict long-standing deficit affect aspect mental functioning . This unfavourable outcome highlight importance preventive treatment schizophrenia relate psychosis . The notion early pharmacological intervention prodromal phase disorder dual aim : 1 ) treat active prodromal symptom 2 ) prevent deterioration progression toward full-blown disorder chronicity . Overall , raise possibility preventing , delay ameliorate onset diagnosable disorder . This type intervention , although already use medical branch potentially ground-breaking mental health delivery system , systematically assess past . Recently , development improve criterion detect individual high risk develop schizophrenia relate psychosis , lead first clinical trial assess role atypical antipsychotic ( i.e. , risperidone olanzapine ) subject . The result study indicate significant clinical benefit nay derive early intervention also point drawback expose patient early stage illness antipsychotic drug associate debilitating ( i.e . motor , metabolic ) side effect . The overall aim propose project ass efficacy safety N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor ( NMDAR ) modulator , glycine transport inhibitor sarcosine ( N-methylglycine ) treatment individual fulfil schizophrenia prodromal syndrome criterion . NMDAR 's dysfunction play cardinal role schizophrenia pathophysiology establishment neurodevelopmental deficit . During last decade demonstrate pharmacological treatment compound enhance NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission due agonistic activity NMDAR-associated glycine site ( e.g . glycine , D-serine ) lead significant symptom reduction chronic schizophrenia patient . Furthermore , preliminary finding suggest glycine treatment may also beneficial patient high risk develop schizophrenia . By increase glycine synaptic level , sarcosine may generate improve therapeutic effect high risk individual . Sarcosine natural amino acid already show reduce positive , negative cognitive symptomatology chronic well acute schizophrenia patient . Advantages sarcosine vs. glycine site agonist use include relatively low dose require lack known side effect . Synthetic compound conceptually similar sarcosine presently various stage development major pharmacological company . In proposed project , three-year period , 60 individual fulfil prodromal criterion randomly enter 16 week parallel group , double-blind , placebo control trial 2 gr/day sarcosine , optional 8 week open-label extension . Clinical , neurocognitive , electrophysiological , amino acid ( i.e . glycine , serine , glutamate ) level genetic assessment perform study . The specific aim propose project : 1 ) ass efficacy safety sarcosine active treatment prodromal symptom , 2 ) ass sarcosine effect term relevant amino acid serum level , neurocognitive performance relevant brain electrophysiological parameter 3 ) supply preliminary data regard capacity sarcosine treatment delay/prevent conversion full blow psychotic disorder . The overall importance propose project consist potential lay foundation innovative type treatment schizophrenia prodromal state .</detailed_description>
