	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study give radiation therapy combination chemotherapy see well work treat patient clinically radiologically progressive low-grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Clinically Radiologically Progressive Low-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Provide comprehensive treatment strategy child adolescents low-grade glioma tumour location histology . - Provide standardized treatment indication treatment recommendation non-surgical therapy child adolescent low grade glioma without associate neurofibrosis-type 1 ( NF1 ) diagnosis observation . - Determine overall , event-free , progression-free survival . - Radiotherapy arm : . Determine progression free survival old child without NF1 treat radiotherapy use modern technique plan treatment . b . Determine reduction rate intensity possible late effect therapy organ risk optimize planning treatment . - Chemotherapy arm : . Determine progression free survival young child without NF1 treat chemotherapy randomize either 2-drug 3-drug induction regimen . b . Determine distribution response week 24 ( induction ) young child without NF1 treat chemotherapy randomize either 2-drug 3-drug induction regimen . c. Determine progression free survival child NF1treated chemotherapy . - Determine influence clinical histological finding overall survival , progression-free event-free survival patient . - Determine prospectively late effect tumor therapy patient . OUTLINE : This partially randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Children completely resect tumor , incompletely resected tumor , clinically/neuroradiologically diagnosed tumor , severe symptom diagnosis , observe follow-up . Children unresectable/incompletely-resectable tumor , relapse disease observe follow incomplete initial resection neuroradiologic diagnosis clinical and/or neuro-radiologic progression receive non-surgical therapy . This non-surgical therapy either chemotherapy ( child younger 8 year neurofibrosis-type 1 [ NF1 ] ) radiotherapy ( child older 8 year ) . - Chemotherapy : Within chemotherapy arm , patient without NF1 randomize receive 1 2 induction chemotherapy regimen . Patients NF1 receive two-drug induction therapy arm I . - Arm I ( two-drug induction therapy [ vincristine-carboplatin ] ) : Patients receive induction therapy comprise vincristine IV day 1 week 1-10 week 13 , 17 , 21 carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 week 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 17 , 21 . - Arm II ( three-drug induction therapy [ vincristine-carboplatin-etoposide ] ) : Patients receive vincristine carboplatin two-drug induction therapy . Patients also receive etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-3 week 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 . Beginning week 25 , patient chemotherapy arm receive consolidation therapy comprise vincristine IV day 1 , 8 , 15 carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 9 course . Patients experience disease progression allergic reaction carboplatin receive vincristine IV day 1 , 8 , 15 either cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1 cisplatin IV 3 hour day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 5 course . All patient chemotherapy arm receive total 18 month treatment . - Radiotherapy : Conventional external beam fractionate radiotherapy give standard dos child receive radiotherapy . Brachytherapy give , tumor suitable type treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 520 patient accrue randomized arm study .</detailed_description>

Data patient may register learn therapeutic intervention may prove useful patient develop separate strategy future Patients choroid plexus papilloma enter SIOPCPT study ( Prof. Dr. J. Wolff , M.D . Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , Texas ) PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : No preexist impairment health status , make conduct study impossible ethically unwise No evidence pregnancy lactation period Pregnancy prevent fertile adolescent girl chemotherapy reliable contraception method ( e.g. , hormonal contraception ) PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : The tumor pretreated chemotherapy radiotherapy Children treat chemotherapy radiotherapy prior enter study evaluate separately Previous treatment steroid consider chemotherapeutic treatment Surgery type extent allow Prior surgical resection tumor allow Participation another clinical study concurrently study ( e.g. , endocrinologic study ) allow provide interfering present treatment strategy No concurrent chemotherapy Concurrent medication associate condition ( e.g. , hormone replacement , anticonvulsant ) contain cytostatic drug allow INCLUSION CRITERIA Age : child adolescent completion 18th year life . Histology : low grade glioma accord ICD O Code Children chiasmatichypothalamic tumor may eligible without histological diagnosis , neuroradiologic finding meet unequivocal criterion presence low grade glioma . Primary tumor localization : intracranial and/or spinal cord . Dissemination : Children present disseminate low grade glioma eligible study .
