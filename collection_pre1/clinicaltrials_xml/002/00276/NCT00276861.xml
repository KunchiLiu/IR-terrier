	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine oxaliplatin work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together oxaliplatin work second-line therapy treat patient metastatic recurrent colon cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Oxaliplatin Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine complete response partial response rate patient recurrent progressive colon cancer treat gemcitabine hydrochloride oxaliplatin . Secondary - Determine overall failure-free survival patient treat chemotherapy regimen . - Determine duration response ( complete partial ) patient treat regimen . - Determine percentage patient experience 50 % fall serum carcinoembryonic antigen level baseline elevation &gt; 5 U/mL receive regimen . - Evaluate toxicity associate administration regimen patient . OUTLINE : This non-randomized study . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 100 minute day 1 oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 2 . Courses repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 27 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
