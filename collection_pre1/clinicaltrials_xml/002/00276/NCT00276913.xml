	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To determine safety , toxicity maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) intravenous STA-5312 administer weekly ( 3 4 week ) subject advance metastatic solid tumor . - To determine pharmacokinetics STA-5312 . Secondary Objective : • To assess antitumor activity STA-5312 administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study STA-5312 Subjects With Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I open-label , dose-escalation safety study subject refractory non hematologic malignancy . STA-5312 administer intravenously . Administration anticipate take 1 hour , although infusion time may extend appropriate large infusion volume . A treatment cycle 4 week weekly infusion STA 5312 first 3 week 4 week cycle . The planned treatment schedule 2 cycle STA-5312 treatment ( 8 week ) . Decisions regard dose escalation DLT determination make base observation first cycle therapy . Subjects tolerate treatment may eligible continue receive additional cycle STA 5312 per investigator 's medical judgment . Evaluation antitumor response perform every 2 cycle STA 5312 administration . The initial dose level STA 5312 6 mg/m2 . The start dose level chosen base preclinical animal study use alternate day dose x 3/week alternate week . The dose level 6 mg/m2 represent less 1/10 weekly dose ( 3 mg/m2 x 3 ) demonstrate severe toxicity . Subsequent dose escalation follow accelerate titration design 8 mg/m2 cohort complete No few 3 patient enrol dose level . Once DLT observe cohort expand least six subject . If one-third least 6 subject treat dose level experience DLT , dose escalation terminate . The dose consider MTD expand least 12 subject collect additional safety pharmacokinetic data . No intrasubject dose escalation occur .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male female subject age least 18 year histologicallyconfirmed non hematological malignancy metastatic unresectable standard therapy exist . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance status 02 . Peripheral neuropathy less Grade 2 National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCI CTC ) version 3 adverse event scale . Subjects must acceptable organ marrow function Screening Period define . ( Note : Subjects must meet criterion predose visit receive additional dos STA5312 ) . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great 1500 cells/µL Platelets great 100,000/µL Total bilirubin must &lt; 1.5 time ULN Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≤3 time ULN less 5 time ULN subject liver metastasis Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤3 time ULN less 5 time ULN subject liver metastasis Adequate renal function ( serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL ) . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) without evidence clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia active ischemia determine investigator . Documented cardiac ejection fraction great 50 % obtain within 30 day administration first dose . The effect STA5312 develop human fetus unknown . Therefore , woman childbearing potential ( defined woman 50 year age history amenorrhea &lt; 12 month prior study entry ) must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should female subject become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Subjects chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study Subjects previous highdose chemotherapy autologous allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Subjects primary brain tumor active brain metastasis exclude . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis receive corticosteroid anticonvulsant eligible . History stroke within 6 month treatment significant neurological limitation . Use investigational agent within 4 week study enrollment . History severe allergic reaction excipients ( e.g . Tween 80/polysorbate 80 ) , include severe hypersensitivity reaction define great Grade 3 base NCI CTC version 3 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive subject receive combination antiretroviral therapy , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , ventricular arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
