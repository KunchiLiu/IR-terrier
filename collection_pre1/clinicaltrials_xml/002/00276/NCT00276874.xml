Participants require refrain use non-study drug , nicotine , undergo daily urine breathalyzer test . Questionnaires use assess drug effect cocaine craving , computerize test measure motor function performance . Heart rate blood pressure monitor periodically ; electrocardiogram ( ECG ) record continuously monitor heart electrical activity . Following end experiment , participant offer referral drug abuse treatment program . The first experiment last 9 week enroll 8 individual addict cocaine . Participants take part daily session receive vary dos cocaine aripiprazole , alone combination . This provide important information regard safety tolerability cocaine-aripiprazole combination . The second experiment last 10 week enroll 12 individual addict cocaine . Participants take part various phase , last several day . The phase include cocaine sampling phase ; cocaine acquisition phase participant receive monetary reward distinguish cocaine placebo ; placebo phase ; aripiprazole maintenance phase ; cocaine dose response phase ability aripiprazole reduce cocaine 's stimulating effect examine ; washout phase drug give . Cocaine aripiprazole dos determine result first experiment . The third experiment last 8 week enroll 12 individual addict cocaine . A self-administration procedure design model relapse use assess effect prim dos cocaine subsequent cocaine-taking behavior , alone follow aripiprazole treatment . Participants assign receive placebo first part study follow aripiprazole remainder study vice versa . During experimental session , participant receive specify amount cocaine , act prim dose . Next , participant choose receive either another similar dose cocaine money . This follow washout phase several sampling-choice session differ amount cocaine .
