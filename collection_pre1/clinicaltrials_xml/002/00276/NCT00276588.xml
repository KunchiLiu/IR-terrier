	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , carboplatin , paclitaxel work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together carboplatin follow paclitaxel work treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Carboplatin Followed Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy tolerability gemcitabine hydrochloride carboplatin follow paclitaxel patient stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer regard response rate , median survival , one year survival . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Part 1 : Patients receive carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course . In week 7 , patient proceed part 2 regardless disease response . - Part 2 : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1-3 hour weekly 6 week . Treatment repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 46 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
