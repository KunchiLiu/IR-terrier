	<brief_summary>The Vulvar Vestibulitis Clinical Trial ( VVCT ) randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind clinical trial . We study clinical efficacy four medical treatment vulvar vestibulitis : topical lidocaine , oral desipramine , combine lidocaine desipramine , placebo cream capsule . Desipramine tricyclic antidepressant commonly use clinician treatment several chronic pain condition demonstrate optimal side effect profile compare tricyclic antidepressant . Topical lidocaine also find beneficial vulvar vestibulitis treatment small study . It hypothesize combine use oral desipramine topical lidocaine therapeutically effective either one good placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Vulvar Vestibulitis Clinical Trial ( VVCT ) randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded clinical trial study clinical efficacy four medical treatment vulvar vestibulitis : 1 ) topical lidocaine , 2 ) oral desipramine , 3 ) combine lidocaine desipramine , 4 ) placebo cream capsule . The duration study drug last 12 week post-intervention follow-up 6 12 month . We plan enroll 128 subject university-based clinical program University Rochester ( UR ) .Primary outcome variable compare report pain `` Tampon Test '' ( mean Weeks -2 , -1 , 0 ) , prior randomization report pain `` Tampon Test '' ( mean Weeks 10 , 11 , 12 ) . The dependent ( primary outcome ) variable defined percent change mean `` Tampon test '' pain Weeks ( 10 , 11 , 12 ) Weeks ( -2 , -1 0 ) . The primary analysis 2X2 factorial design involve fit Analysis Covariance ( ANCOVA ) regression model percent change mean `` Tampon test '' pain two treatment variable predictor adjust covariate age . We test interaction two treatment ANCOVA model significant .05 level . If interaction effect significant , drop model conclusion draw model main effect . If significant , model interaction adopt . SAS PROC GLM use analysis . In case non-significant interaction , primary analysis base ANCOVA model main effect treatment adjust age . Since two treatment investigation , primary analysis use Bonferroni correction , i.e . set alpha level 0.025 ( two-sided ) determine statistical significance . The significance main effect treatment assess t-tests ANCOVA model . The aim primary analysis determine whether treatment superior placebo , hypotheses hold , double treatment therapy effective additive effect assumption ANCOVA model . The ANCOVA model compare subject receive treatment subject , irrespective whether receive treatment , adjust treatment age subject , powerful find individual treatment effect study . If interaction treatment significant , ANCOVA model interaction estimate treatment effect four group . This model able test 6 contrast four combination . A hierarchical ( gatekeeping ) test strategy maintain family-wise error rate adopt following : first stage compare desipramine lidocaine individually placebo multiplicity-adjusted p-values . If significant difference ( one null hypothesis reject ) find either individual agent , analysis proceed second-stage hypothesis compare effect active desipramine/active lidocaine treatment double placebo . If significant difference ( null hypothesis reject ) find combined therapy placebo base multiplicity-adjusted p-value , final ( tertiary ) stage comparison perform compare combine therapy individual therapy . In hierarchical ( gatekeeping ) testing procedure , inference stage depend acceptance rejection null hypotheses previously stage , stage serf gatekeeper stage later sequence . In strategy model significant interaction effect , least one hypothesis reject , next stage hypothesis test , family-wise error rate control .05 level . Secondary analysis include subset analysis , comparison double-active treatment group others ( placebo single-treatment group ) percent change mean `` Tampon test '' well standardized pain measure Brief Pain Inventory McGill Pain Questionnaire . This explore active desipramine/active lidocaine treatment advantage may show ANCOVA model . The secondary analysis explore supportive evidence primary objective trial , confirmatory conclusion need . In secondary analysis , confidence interval statistical test exploratory nature claim intend . Primary secondary outcome variable analyze accord modify `` intention treat '' `` last observation carry forward '' . The sample analyze primary outcome include first three few pre-randomization Tampon Test measure last three few post-randomization Tampon Test measure , include study Week 12 . The subject sample analyzed drug safety/side effect include subject take least one dose study drug .</detailed_description>
