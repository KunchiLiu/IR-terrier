	<brief_summary>The primary objective study : - Determine safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) IPI-504 GIST STS patient fail prior therapy - Recommend dose subsequent study IPI-504</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study IPI-504 Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ( GIST ) Soft Tissue Sarcomas ( STS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IPI-504 novel , water-soluble analog 17-AAG potent inhibitor Hsp90 . Hsp90 's role cell control proper folding , function , viability various `` client '' protein . Many client protein ( AKT , Her-2 , Bcr-Abl , PDGFR-Î± , c-Kit ) oncoproteins important cell signal protein . In patient GIST , mutation tyrosine kinase receptor Kit play critical role pathogenesis disease . Inhibition Kit signal tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib ( IM ) effective treatment GIST patient . However , new mutation arise Kit confer resistance IM treatment result disease progression . Kit client protein Hsp90 sensitive IPI-504 . In Soft Tissue Sarcomas , may genetic abnormality lead expression certain protein drive growth cancer . These cancer-driving protein may stimulate HSP90 . This provide scientific rationale Phase 1 clinical test IPI-504 patient advanced GIST STS fail prior therapy .</detailed_description>
