	<brief_summary>This research work important cure/control HIV infection . The objective treatment case HIV patient essentially bring viral load closer undetectable level . The study depend potential influence 'Kallunk Oxide ' CD4+ T cell effectiveness surface HIV-1 . The basic study break surface protein directly inhibit protein 's increased function , CD4+T cell also CD3 CD8+ T cell , appropriate antidote . The 'Yogaprabhava ' , drug 's effectiveness , progressive immunity diet lifestyle easily study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research individual investigator initiate meritorious project identify potential role safe effective use Complementary Alternative Medicine CAM treatment HIV infection . This modest Phase-I phase II clinical trial intervention Studies . In case HIV infection , study formulate 20 random number batch . The Principal Investigator ( PI ) select inform consented patient recruit study adhere Helsinki Declaration . Selection subject : HIV patient CD3 , CD4 , CD8 + T cell count &gt; 450 cu/mm^3 enrol Wing No : 1 group . HIV patient CD+ T cell count &gt; 450 cu/mm^3 recruit basic Arm study . The select Arm - 1 research , specific potential milestone baseline CD+T cell count &gt; 450 cu/mm^3 determine outcomes previously conduct Observational Phase-1 study data . The statistical evaluation laboratory parameter exist group measure Immune Cells Count Assay . The prolonged viral suppression reversal HIV seropositivity ultimate research outcome study evaluate safety efficacy drug . Absolute assay Viral Load , Lymphocyte Enumeration , Western Blot blood test convince mean value reference range method adopt laboratory study . The drug administer optimal dos 200 mg 500 mg study subject , respectively , 8 17 year old child 18 65 year old Men Women anticipate 500 Female 500 Male participant . The ELISA/P-24 test use confirm HIV-seropositivity . The patient safe effective optimum dose primary come measure Viral Load assay Immune Cells Count assay secondary outcome measure . The randomized number arrange single patient 's clinical record . Patient 's body weight , CD4 T cell count , skin thickness , body measurement , blood pressure , temperature , pulse rate , anti body count , hematological examination investigate treatment period . The well-designed research team mind symptom nausea , fatigue , weight loss , sweat , shortness breath , joint pain etc Side effect treatment , , could carefully note . On entry end study , biochemical investigation urine examination , serum lipoprotein cholesterol individually note . Patient 's temperature , digestion complaint , chill , etc could treat medicine restrict diet without use mutton soup , milk , cow ghee . The study reduce patient 's stress well depression also manage productivity , emotional well , immunity quality life practice treatment . The study handle transparent privacy environment recruit HIV-infected people India . Dosage : HIV patient administer daily dose sample size product , 500 mg adult 200 mg child ( 8 year old ) , one course . Controlled Nourished diet : All patient adhere nourished diet protocol . The controlled diet milk ( 1/2 cup ) , rice wheat food product , cow ghee , green gram , mutton soup , prepared black pepper add vegetable food . Restriction : HIV-Patients use salt , oil , mustard , tamarind fish item within 10 day medication use . Drug Administration : HIV- patient use one drug `` Kallunk oxide ( Immunotherapy ) '' calcined/or oxidize molecule . The powder form sample size medicine put 1/2 cup hotter water ( adjuvant ) . Precaution : No precaution need . Patients use sediment bottom cup .</detailed_description>
