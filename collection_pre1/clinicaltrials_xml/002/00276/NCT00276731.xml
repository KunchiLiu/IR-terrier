	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy follow surgery alone effective combination chemotherapy follow surgery radiation therapy treat neuroblastoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study combination chemotherapy follow surgery see well work compare combination chemotherapy follow surgery radiation therapy treat young patient stage II stage III neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Followed By Surgery With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Young Patients With Stage II Stage III Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare local control event-free overall survival young patient stage IIB III neuroblastoma treat neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy follow surgery v without radiotherapy . - Determine toxic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize study . - Induction combination chemotherapy : Patients receive vincristine IV cyclophosphamide IV day 1 . Patients also receive cisplatin IV continuously 24 hour day 1 etoposide IV 4 hour day 2 course 1 , 3 , 5 carboplatin IV 1 hour etoposide IV 4 hour day 1 course 2 4 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients proceed surgery unless complete resection do initial stag complete response maintain . - Surgery : Patients undergo biopsy surgical resection tumor 2-3 week completion induction combination chemotherapy . - Post-surgical treatment : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive two additional course combination chemotherapy comprise vincristine , cisplatin , etoposide , cyclophosphamide course 6 vincristine , carboplatin , etoposide , cyclophosphamide course 7 . - Arm II : Patients undergo radiotherapy 2-4 week surgery . Beginning 3 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive chemotherapy arm I After completion study treatment , patient evaluate periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 150 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
