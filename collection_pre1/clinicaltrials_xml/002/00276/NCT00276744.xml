PURPOSE : This phase II trial study individualized drug treatment selection process , base laboratory result , treat patient pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individualized Drug Treatment Selection Process Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Establish tumor xenografts patient resectable adenocarcinoma pancreas undergo surgical resection Johns Hopkins Hospital . - Determine activity series 10 anticancer drug tumor ex vivo study . - Determine response rate , time treatment failure , 6-month survival rate patient whose tumor xenografted treated mouse treat active agent identify model . - Define determinant susceptibility resistance drug xenografted tumor . OUTLINE : - Part I ( surgical resection , tumor xenograft generation , drug selection ) : Patients undergo surgical resection . The resected tumor tissue implant laboratory mouse generate tumor xenograft . The mouse treat series 10 approved anticancer drug , whose anticancer activity rank least effective base response tumor xenograft . The effective drug identify individual patient . Patients drug find effective remove study . Patients develop progressive disease surgical resection mouse data available proceed part II . - Part II ( individual patient treatment ) : Patients receive effective drug identify part I absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The drug may include bortezomib , capecitabine , cetuximab , docetaxel , erlotinib hydrochloride , gemcitabine hydrochloride , irinotecan hydrochloride , mitomycin C , sirolimus , thalidomide . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
