	<detailed_description>Excess body fat , hallmark obesity major risk factor development insulin resistance ( decreased insulin sensitivity ) , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease . Previous study show South Asians ( people originate Indian subcontinent ) appear particularly prone develop diabetes heart disease compare white Caucasians European origin . In Canada , Study Health Assessment Risk Ethnic group ( SHARE ) , observed random selection South Asian European individual , South Asians twice much type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease significantly insulin resistant Europeans despite similar body mass index ( BMI ) waist circumference . It possible increased propensity South Asians develop insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease relate great total body fat and/or increase visceral fat addition possible biological difference adipose tissue skeletal muscle tissue . The primary objective study therefore determine difference among age , sex , BMI-matched people South Asian European Caucasian descent body composition ( specifically total body fat , lean body mass ) fat distribution ( fat store body ) . This study therefore test hypothesis similar BMI , South Asians total body fat less lean body mass age sex-matched European Caucasians . The secondary objective study look difference two ethnic group biological level , include : difference visceral fat , adipose tissue morphology , imflammation adipokine production , skeletal muscle fat content , fatty acid oxidation mitochondrial activity .</detailed_description>
