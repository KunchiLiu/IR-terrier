	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine central feature Therapeutic Workplace , abstinence reinforcement contingency , critical initiate cocaine abstinence injection drug use methadone patient use cocaine consistently methadone treatment . All subject initially invite attend Therapeutic Workplace initial period , abstinence require work time . During initial period , voucher contingent workplace attendance performance training program . Subjects ( n=70 ) attend workplace consistently first 4 week treatment , continue use cocaine randomly assign Work Only Abstinence Plus Work group . Subjects Work Only group continue able work independent urinalysis result . However , subject Abstinence Plus Work group require provide urine sample show evidence recent cocaine abstinence . Subjects group invite stay workplace 6 month . We expect subject Abstinence Work group achieve high rate abstinence subject Work Only group . This result would show abstinence reinforcement contingency ( i.e. , requirement provide cocaine-free urine sample work earn voucher ) important initiation abstinence study population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods Setting Materials This study conduct Center Learning Health , treatment-research unit Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center , Baltimore , MD . The therapeutic workplace include workplace sign-in station urinalysis laboratory , three workroom ( associated staff space ) training occur . When participant arrive workplace day , report workplace sign-in station locate entrance urinalysis laboratory . Staff sit laboratory side entrance workplace sign-in station desk , equip Dell personal computer electronic barcode reader ( Unitech速 Barcode Slot Reader model # MS140I-2 , St Louis , MO ) . Urine breath sample collect tested urinalysis laboratory . Breath sample test alcohol AlcoSensor III ( Intoximeter , St. Louis , MO ) . Females provide urine sample directly Commode Specimen Containers ( Catalog # 00077 , Sage Products , Inc. , Crystal Lake , IL ) place directly toilet . The urine sample temperature test transferred storage cup . Males provide sample directly paper cup , temperature test transferred storage cup . All urine sample temperature test use F-1500 Electronic Thermometer ( Sherwood Medical , St. Louis , MO ) . The urinalysis laboratory contain Abbott AxSYM速 immunoassay system urine testing . The AxSYM速 employ fluorescent polarization immunoassay ( FPIA ) technology ( Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Park , IL ) . Participants receive therapeutic workplace training program three workroom ( total 161 m2 ) contain total 47 individual three-sided workstation ( 155 cm tall x 64 cm deep x 126 cm wide ) . Each workstation equip desktop ( 60 cm deep x 121 cm wide ) ; height adjustable chair arm ; Dell personal computer , keyboard mouse . Keyboards cover removable plastic cover ( Protect Keyboard Cover , West Bountiful , UT ) paint black letter key could read type . Each participant give water bottle , headphone listen music CDs train personal computer , cooler store lunch , picture frame personalize workstation . The three workroom open central area ( 31 m2 ) workroom assistant sit monitor activity participant workroom . Participants pass central staff area enter leave workroom . The central area equip three desk , personal computer . Each desk also equip Unitech速 electronic barcode slot reader . All participant staff computer interconnect high-speed ( T1 ) line central Dell PowerEdge server . All typing , keypad data entry training program ; monitor work time earnings ; voucher system controlled custom web-based therapeutic workplace software application program reside one PowerEdge server ( Silverman et al. , 2005 ) . Recruitment Participant Selection The Western Institutional Review Board approve study . Participants enrol study April 2003 November 2003 . To recruit participant , flyer letter distribute 11 Baltimore City methadone program invite unemployed adult methadone treatment apply enroll study provide job skill train monetary voucher . Research staff also visit methadone treatment program describe study methadone treatment staff ( e.g. , counselor ) . Interested individual approach call research staff first complete anonymous brief screen interview ask 8 question design determine quickly might eligible study . Some question add conceal eligibility requirement . The interview ask individual ' age , marital status , employment status , drug route administration use past 30 day , type drug abuse treatment currently receive , whether receive welfare benefit , much earn employment past 30 day , whether several medical condition ( e.g. , asthma , HIV ) . Brief screen interview conduct phone , person methadone treatment program , person Center Learning Health . Applicants invited participate full screening interview report 18 year old , unemployed , injected heroin cocaine , use cocaine crack past 30 day , currently enrol methadone maintenance treatment Baltimore City . Full screen interview . At begin full screening interview , participant invite sign initial screen consent form . Participants required pas write quiz detail consent form participate . Participants also require read paragraph consent form aloud read least 80 % word correctly continue full screening interview . Baseline period . Eligible participant invite attend workplace 4 hour every weekday 8 week . Mandatory urine sample collect prior work every Monday , Wednesday Friday . All sample test cocaine opiate . During first 4 week , participant could attend workplace independent urinalysis result earn base pay $ 8.00 per hour plus pay performance training program . To encourage brief break , participant could earn 5 minute pay break every 55 minute work . Pay earn voucher exchangeable good service . At end baseline , participant attend workplace least 50 % workday , provide least two cocaine-positive urine sample , still enrol methadone treatment invite participate main randomize control portion study . Other participant could continue work 4 additional week , require provide urine sample indicate recent abstinence opiate cocaine work . Experimental Design Groups Stratification random assignment . Participants enrol main study ( N = 56 ) randomly assign Work Only ( n = 28 ) Abstinence &amp; Work ( n = 28 ) group . Immediately prior actual assignment , study coordinator , direct contact participant , randomize participant use computer program stratification procedure ( similar Silverman et al. , 2004 ) base ) whether 75 % participant 's baseline urine sample test positive cocaine ( Y/N ) , b ) whether 100 % participant 's baseline urine sample test positive cocaine ( Y/N ) . Study group . Both group invite attend workplace throughout 26-week intervention period . Participants group continue provide mandatory urine sample could earn base performance pay . Both group also receive feedback result urinalysis test . The two group differ participant Abstinence &amp; Work group require provide urine sample indicate recent cocaine abstinence ( i.e. , decrease urinary benzoylecgonine concentration 20 % per day last sample provide benzoylecgonine concentration 300 ng/mL ; adapt procedure develop Preston , Schuster , Silverman &amp; Cone , 1997 ) gain access workplace maintain maximum base pay $ 8.00 per hour . If participant ever provide urine sample meet criterion recent cocaine abstinence participant fail provide schedule sample , participant allow work day participant 's base pay decrease $ 1.00 per hour . In addition , participant require provide urine sample every workday participant provide sample meet abstinence requirement . After participant 's base pay reset , increase $ 1.00 per hour maximum $ 8.00 per hour every day participant meet cocaine abstinence requirement work least 5 minute . The voucher system schedule escalate reinforcement sustain abstinence workplace attendence adapt system develop Higgins et al. , 1991 . General Workplace Procedures Urine collection , test feedback . After sign workplace mandatory urine day ( typically Monday , Wednesday Friday week ) , participant require provide urine breath sample observation same-gender research staff member . Urine collection perform use well-developed elaborate urine-collection procedure design ensure collection valid urine sample . Urine sample test cocaine opiate . For participant provide evidence recent cocaine abstinence enter workroom , immediately participant provide urine sample , sample test result ( i.e. , quantitative value ng/mL benzoylecgonine dichotomous result negative positive opiate ) enter therapeutic workplace software . The software automatically determine whether sample meet cocaine abstinence criterion day , display message report result determination , print feedback graph give participant . The feedback graph show log scale benzoylecgonine concentration sample provide participant consecutive calendar day , along line indicate criterion cocaine abstinence day . In addition , text box print side graph indicate result current day include benzoylecgonine concentration , whether sample test negative positive opiate , participant grant access workplace . If sample meet cocaine abstinence requirement , sign-in station assistant give participant bar-coded picture ID card bring workroom assistant gain entrance participant 's workroom . During condition contingency cocaine abstinence gain access workplace ( i.e. , baseline period intervention period Work Only participant ) , immediately participant provide urine sample sample test , sign-in station assistant hand participant bar-coded picture ID card bring workroom assistant gain entrance participant 's workroom . Later day , participant 's sample test , result enter therapeutic workplace software , feedback graph ( identical one described ) print deliver participant .</detailed_description>
