	<brief_title>Effectiveness Alternative Approaches Providing Spectacles Tanzanian Secondary School Students</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Worldwide uncorrected significant refractive error ( RE ) among common cause visual impairment . This combined effectiveness simplicity correct RE provide spectacle make correction RE one priorities Vision 2020 . However , little information available effective strategy identify deliver optical service affect individual develop country Aim The aim study compare effectiveness two intervention , namely provide free spectacle prescription student insufficiently correct uncorrected significant refractive error Objectives 1 . To estimate prevalence type significant refractive error secondary school child Tanzania , determine unmet need spectacles 2 . To compare effectiveness provide free spectacle vs. offer prescription . This judged proportion student need spectacle wear spectacle 3 6 month prescription 3 . To explore attitude spectacles reason non-compliance Methods The study take place Dar e Salaam , Tanzania January September 2004 . 52 school randomly select 2 intervention group ( Group A B ) use random selection stratify school status ( government vs. private ) . Students screen significant refractive error . A socio-economic questionnaire administer student . Students need spectacle Group A school receive free spectacle ( intervention A ) , student group B school receive prescription spectacle ( intervention B ) . Students follow 3 6 month spectacle provision/prescription check compliance explore reason non-compliance . Main analyse data prevalence visual impairment cause , risk factor myopia , compliance spectacle 3 6 month . Results 1 . Prevalence impair visual acuity cause 6,904 student screen eye team . 2.9 % student uncorrected poor VA , 2.3 % poor presenting VA 0.6 % still poor VA best correction . The main cause visual impairment significant refractive error ( 84 % ) . The prevalence uncorrected significant RE secondary school student Dar es Salaam low 1.8 % . Even assume student unconfirmed poor present screen eyesight ( 0.8 % ) uncorrected significant RE unlikely maximum prevalence would estimate 2.6 % . 2 . Compliance spectacles Students actually purchase spectacle twice likely wear 3 6 month student receive free spectacle , small proportion purchase ( 3 month : 30 % ; 6 month : 45 % ) . Only 46 % student receive free spectacle wear school 3 month 53 % 6 month . Significant independent predictor student wear spectacle school 3 6 month prescription provision free spectacle : - Having purchase spectacle ( less likely , OR=0.07 0.42 ) - Bilateral good presenting vision , mild refractive error undercorrected significant error ( less likely unilateral visual impairment ) unilateral visual impairment ( less likely bilateral visual impairment ; OR=0.47 step ) - Myopia compare astigmatism hyperopia , severe enough impair distance vision ( likely , OR= 68 â€“infinity ) The majority student go purchase spectacle seem purchase soon prescription . 3 . Risk factor myopia Female sex , non-African ethnicity professional mother independent significant risk factor myopia population . These finding similar risk factor myopia find population . Conclusions/ Recommendation 1 . Significant refractive error common cause avoidable visual impairment Tanzanian secondary school student Dar e Salaam . However , prevalence uncorrected bilateral unilateral significant refractive error Form 1 student low ( less 3 % ) make value screen RE population questionable . Screening seem even less justified one consider 46 % student provide free spectacle wear spectacle school three month later . If student ask purchase spectacle , proportion even low 26 % . 2 . Similar study different cultural setting need explore compliance reason non-compliance spectacle child , poor compliance make value screen programme questionable .</detailed_description>
