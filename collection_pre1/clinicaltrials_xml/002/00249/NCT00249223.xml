The study compose screen visit , follow two study phase : 8-week run-in period 12-week double-blind period . In run-in phase , patient discontinue antipsychotic drug , begin receive oral risperidone , stay optimal oral risperidone dose determine patient 4 week start double-blind period . Patients randomize either risperidone tablet injectable risperidone formulation dose level establish last 4 week run-in . For next 12 week patient receive injection risperidone every 2 week plus daily oral dos placebo receive placebo injection every 2 week plus daily oral dos resperidone tablet . The primary measure effectiveness change baseline total score Positive Negative Syndrome Scale Schizophrenia ( PANSS ) , rating scale measure symptoms schizophrenia . Additional efficacy test include Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) , rating system use evaluate severity clinical change patient various disease affect brain . Safety evaluation include incidence adverse event , result clinical laboratory test ( hematology , biochemistry , urinalysis ) , measurement vital sign body weight , physical examination electrocardiogram ( ECG ) finding , clinical examination injection area ( buttock ) , Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale ( ESRS ) , scale use measure effect antipsychotic medication motor function patient . The study hypothesis injectable formulation risperidone less effective oral risperidone tablet . The injectable formulation risperidone consider less effective oral risperidone improvement total PANSS injectable risperidone 6 point bad improvement oral risperidone . Risperidone injection ( 25 , 50 75milligrams [ mg ] ) start Day 1 double-blind phase , every 2 week ( total 12 week ) 2 , 4 , 6mg/day risperidone tablet , start Day 1 run-in period continue rest study .</detailed_description>
