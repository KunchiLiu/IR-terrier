In study , researcher want determine combine program endurance weight training exercise well standard amount endurance exercise even high amount endurance exercise breast cancer survivor receive chemotherapy . The study experimental design researcher breast cancer survivor participate one three different exercise program .

	<brief_title>Trial Combined Aerobic Resistance Exercise Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Aerobic exercise show improve physical fitness quality life ( QoL ) breast cancer survivor receive chemotherapy study date examine addition resistance exercise aerobic exercise population . Resistance exercise proven important adjunct aerobic exercise cardiac rehabilitation population although trial control total volume exercise . PURPOSE : The primary purpose present trial compare effect combine aerobic resistance exercise program ( COMB ) standard moderate volume aerobic exercise ( STAN ) high volume aerobic exercise ( HIGH ) control total volume exercise COMB arm . METHODS : The study prospective , three-armed , randomize control trial conduct Edmonton ( coordinate center ) , Ottawa , Vancouver . Participants 300 breast cancer survivor schedule receive adjuvant chemotherapy . All three exercise group ask perform supervise exercise 3 days/week length chemotherapy treatment . The STAN group ask perform approximately 500 kilocalories/week self-selected aerobic activity ( e.g. , treadmill , cycle ergometer , elliptical ) . This arm trial consider standard care base emerge consensus recent systematic review recommendation major cancer agency . The HIGH group ask complete approximately 1,000 kilocalories/week self-selected aerobic activity . The COMB group ask complete 1,000 kilocalories/week split equally aerobic resistance exercise . The primary endpoint trial change physical functioning baseline post intervention assess physical functioning subscale Short Form ( SF ) 36 scale . Secondary endpoint include cardiorespiratory fitness ( maximal treadmill test ) , muscular strength ( 8 repetition maximum test ) , muscular endurance ( standard load test 50 % estimate baseline maximum ) , body composition ( DEXA scan ) , psychological distress , sleep quality , exercise adherence , chemotherapy completion rate . RELEVANCE : An important issue breast cancer survivor receive chemotherapy whether advantage increase volume aerobic exercise add resistance exercise standard aerobic exercise program . If advantage , important breast cancer survivor receive optimal exercise prescription maximize ability cope chemotherapy treatment maintain physical function QoL difficult time .</detailed_description>
