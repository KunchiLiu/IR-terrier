	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Levofloxacin Compared Ticarcillin/Clavulanate Alone Followed Amoxicillin/Clavulanate Treatment Complicated Skin Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levofloxacin antibiotic evaluate clinical trial use treatment many type infection include respiratory tract , urinary tract , uncomplicated skin infection . Levofloxacin may take mouth administer slowly vein show safe effective administer daily . This multicenter , open-label study evaluate safety effectiveness single daily oral intravenous dose levofloxacin compare multiple daily intravenous dos another antibiotic , ticarcillin/clavulanate give alone followed oral amoxicillin/clavulanate , treatment bacterial skin infection . Patients receive 750 mg levofloxacin mouth intravenously 7 - 14 day , 3.1 gram ticarcillin/clavulanate intravenously 7 - 14 day . Patients receive levofloxacin intravenously may switch receive levofloxacin mouth ; patient receive ticarcillin/clavulanate intravenously may switch 875 mg amoxicillin/clavulanate give mouth , twice daily , significant improvement note . Patients assess 3 - 4 day treatment ; treatment discontinue significant improvement note . Patients show sign improvement continue study , assessments 2 - 5 day ( post-therapy visit ) 3 - 4 week ( post-study visit ) completion study drug . The primary measure effectiveness clinical response rate assess 2 - 5 day last dose antibiotic treatment , categorize response cure , improve , fail . Laboratory test presence bacteria perform throughout study . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , physical examination , laboratory test ) perform throughout study . The study hypothesis single daily dose levofloxacin least effective multiple daily dos ticarcillin/clavulanate alone follow amoxicillin/clavulanate treatment skin infection , well tolerate . Levofloxacin 750 mg intravenously mouth , daily 7 - 14 day , ticarcillin/clavulanate 3.1 gram intravenously every 4 - 6 hour , may switch amoxicillin/clavulanate 875 mg mouth , twice daily , total duration 7 - 14 day .</detailed_description>
