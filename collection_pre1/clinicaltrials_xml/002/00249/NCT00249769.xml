	<brief_title>Determining Safety Efficacy Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine When Given With Measles Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Japanese encephalitis lead cause viral neurological disease disability Asia . The severity sequela , together volume case , make JE important cause viral encephalitis world . Approximately 3 billion people—including 700 million children—live Asian area risk JE . JE commonly infect child age 1 15 year , also infect adult area virus newly introduce . More 50,000 case report annually cause estimate 10,000 15,000 death . This figure believe represent small proportion disease burden actually exist . An effective vaccine exist since 1941 , reach poor country Asia . During 60 year vaccine available , JE infect estimate 10.5 million child , result 3 million death 4 million child live long-term disability . Control disease limit due poor disease surveillance , limited unstable vaccine supply , lack guidance programmatic support immunization , limited advocacy . A successful vaccine safe , efficacious , affordable , administer single dose , easily incorporate routine Expanded Programmes Immunization ( EPI ) program . This study help ensure safety SA 14-14-2 simultaneously administer measles vaccine , pave way use routine EPI program . If candidate becomes widely available , drastically increase feasibility routine JE immunization Asia , reduce devastate death disability cause disease . In addition impact low-income country , vaccine allow country purchase vaccine—such Thailand , Vietnam , Sri Lanka , India—to recover health care dollar , improve present program , address unmet health care need .</detailed_description>
