	<brief_title>Aerobic Exercise Training &amp; Autonomic System In Patients After Myocardial Infarction Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imbalance autonomic cardiovascular function show increase risk ventricular arrhythmia sudden death patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , myocardial infarction stroke . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) reflect autonomic tone heart . Under condition increase sympathetic adrenergic tone reduce parasympathetic activity . The effect aerobic rehabilitation Sympathetic-parasympathetic control examine . exercise training alters sympatho-vagal control heart rate variability ( HRV ) towards parasympathetic dominance patient acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) diabetic patient . To knowledge , post-stroke patient issue n't investigate . It known different people react differently physical training . There difference opinion literature concern function Genetic parameter , Polymorphism ACE ( Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ) , hemodynamic Reactions follow Physical Activity whether connection Polymorphism physical performance.. Objectives To examine effect Aerobic Physical Activity function Autonomic System patient Myocardial Infarction Stroke . A secondary objective examine whether possible predict patient benefit physical activity ( exercise training ) , take account , genetic factor Polymorphism ACE ( Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ) Research Population The research subject include ) patient Myocardial Infarction age 20 - 80 , underwent percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , b ) patient first Stroke age 20 - 80 , two month stroke , NIH Stroke Score 6 - 20 able cooperate follow instruction . Methods Part A This research examine effect Aerobic Physical Activity function Autonomic Nervous System various physiological clinical factor B.P. , blood sugar level , tryglycerides , HDL , LDL , CRP aerobic physical fitness , 70 cardiac patient participate Heart Rehabilitation Program Hadassah Hospital Mt . Scopus 30 post Stroke patient . Control Group I Includes 70 cardiac patient 30 post Stroke patient , thate NOT include Exercise Training Program ARE suitable regard age , sex , clinical background . Group II Includes 30 healthy individual , suitable research group regard age sex , know cardio-vascular disease participate Aerobic Exercise Training Program 3 month . At commencement end research : Patients research control group undergo follow test : - 1 . Stress Test 2 . Measurement Heart Rate Variability mean `` Holter '' monitor . 3 . General Blood test ( Triglycerides , HDL , LDL , sugar HB.A1C.CRP ) 4 . Quality life accord SF questionnaire . 5 . B.P Pulse rest . 6 . NIH Stroke Scale 7 . MAS ( Motor Assessment Scale ) . 8 . FIM ( Functional Independence Scale ) 9 . Walking Speed Test ; ( distance cover two minute ) comfortable speed . During test patient connect Polar Watch ( heart rate monitor ) check Heart Rate . Physical ( Exercise ) Training 1 . Each patient receive personal training program optimal heart rate determine result stress test accord Borg scale - scale assessing , subjectively , train intensity level . RPE ( Rating perceive exertion scale ) 2 . Duration program : 3 month , 2 session week , session last 60 minute . 3 . Session include 15 minute warm-up , main part - aerobic workout exercise machine 35 minute , relaxation 10 minute . 4 . The main part include work follow fitness machine ; treadmill , bicycle arm ergometria . 5 . The heart rate monitor constantly train , mean Polar Watch . 6 . At start end session , blood pressure measure , necessary also session . 7 . The intensity effort examine mean Borg Scale ( RPE ) subjective assessment level difficulty . Part B Blood test end train program include test ACE Insertion/Deletion Polymorphism .</detailed_description>
