	<brief_summary>Breast nipple aspirate fluid ( NAF ) useful non-invasive monitoring breast . NAF show exhibit large inter-individual difference lipid peroxidation . Unfortunately , yield epithelial cell NAF low . More recently , breast ductal lavage approve clinical use . Nuclear morphologic feature breast biopsy show previously prognostic value breast cancer risk . In woman without cancer , may subtle change breast epithelial cell define computer-assisted measurement . The subject select study 98 woman biopsy-confirmed proliferative breast disease . These woman slightly increase breast cancer risk , exhibit high mean level cholesterol cholesterol oxide NAF woman non-proliferative histology breast . Levels 8-isoprostane , cholesterol , fatty acid , fat-soluble micronutrient 2,6-cyclolycopene-4,5-diol quantify breast NAF obtain breast lavage . These measure choose base potential relationship dietary intake oxidative stress , relevant application method dietary prevention studies.The investigator characterize morphology breast epithelial cell lavage use quantitative image cytometry capture nuclear cellular area , diameter , roundness , perimeter , nuclear : cytoplasmic area ratio . Correlations evaluate measure morphologic feature analyte NAF . The impact various clinical , demographic dietary factor cellular morphology also explore .

	<detailed_description>WHY THE STUDY IS BEING DONE Breast nipple aspirate fluid ( NAF ) obtain non-invasively woman , make analysis fluid relevant study breast cancer risk . The inter-individual variation lipid oxidation product ( type damage fat ) NAF 100-fold , oxidation product likely toxic effect breast epithelial cell . During breast ductal lavage , NAF first aspirate , duct produce fluid subject lavage obtain epithelial cell . The nuclear feature ( morphology ) cell examine . Nuclear morphology quantitative method observe subtle change nuclear feature , measure benign breast biopsy show prognostic value breast cancer risk . This exploratory study help establish feasibility use measure endpoint dietary intervention study . Since difference lipid oxidation level NAF markedly large , reasonable believe must influence nuclear morphology . These measure also applicable investigation seek examine impact certain genetic polymorphism environmental exposure biomarkers oxidative stress breast cancer risk . We study woman diagnose previously proliferative breast disease . These woman may good candidate dietary prevention study since somewhat increase risk breast cancer , receive little beyond surgery treatment , show high level lipid oxidation breast woman diagnosis . WHAT WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH We hope determine feasibility obtain analyze NAF breast epithelial cell woman benign proliferative breast disease . These woman increase breast cancer risk , composition NAF , bath breast duct may affect morphological feature nuclei breast epithelial cell . If level lipid oxidation product higher woman large nucleus ( risk factor breast cancer ) , intervention reduce oxidative stress cancer risk may plan future . The aim : 1 . To determine level fat , damage oxidized fat , oxidize damage vitamin vitamin ( 8-isoprostane , cholesterol , fatty acid , tocopherol , carotenoid 2,6-cyclolycopene-4,5-diol ) quantify breast NAF obtain breast lavage . Levels NAF compare blood . These measure choose base potential relationship dietary intake oxidative stress level , relevant intervention study . Tocopherols carotenoid dietary antioxidant , certain fatty acid oxidize readily others . Both 8-isoprostane 2,6-cyclolycopene-4,5-diol appear marker oxidative stress . 2 . To obtain breast lavage fluid woman proliferative breast disease characterize nuclear morphology breast epithelial cell breast lavage fluid . We quantify various measure commonly use biopsy include nuclear diameter , circumference , area , roundness nuclear : cytoplasmic area ratio . These measure show related breast cancer risk . If sufficient cell , analysis oxidative DNA damage make use comet assay . 3 . To examine whether nuclear morphology associate level oxidative stress NAF . Correlations evaluate level 8-isoprostane , cholesterol , specific fatty acid , 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diol fat-soluble micronutrient . The potential influence diet , demographic factor nature previous biopsy diagnosis nuclear morphology also examine sub-aim effort well understand difference among woman nuclear morphology epithelial cell ductal lavage . The material gather research purpose : Consent Form Health Status Questionnaire Food Frequency Questionnaire Height body weight Breast nipple aspirate fluid Breast lavage fluid 10-ml Blood sample biopsy date , diagnosis history medical problem medical chart SAMPLE SIZE It desire equip study variable interest determine within coefficient variation ( CV ) 25 % , 90 % confidence . Sixty subject would yield estimate mean level 8 9 study variable within CV 25 % , 90 % confidence . The one exception highly variable 8-isoprostane measure , whose mean level could estimate within CV 37 % , 90 % confidence . HOW THE STUDY WILL BE CONDUCTED A total 75 woman recruit study roughly 13 month ( ten month year 1 3 month year 2 ) clinician . She confirm patient chart previous diagnosis proliferative breast disease , obtain type breast disease diagnose , long ago diagnose near month , breast health problem could affect lavage result . The study subject fill questionnaire , weigh measure height , donate 10-ml blood sample undergo breast lavage procedure . During lavage procedure , breast nipple fluid lavage fluid collect . Breast ductal lavage important new procedure use help determine woman 's risk breast cancer . It attractive diagnostic method since associate little discomfort . At present , use certain woman think high-risk breast cancer . During ductal lavage procedure , fluid-producing duct must first identify . This do first free duct nipple surface keratin plug , woman use massage produce fluid . This fluid , call nipple aspirate fluid ( NAF ) , bathe breast duct collect analysis propose project . Once ducts produce NAF identify , physician lavage duct . The lavage fluid wash breast cell evaluate pathologist determine whether normal . The entire procedure do use anesthetic nipple surface initially lavage fluid minimize discomfort , level discomfort generally less mammogram . An early indicator breast cancer risk may characteristics epithelial cell lavage fluid . These breast cell dislodge upon lavage , place onto slide pathologist examines abnormality . Beyond pathological diagnosis , may subtle change appearance cell . Changes size shape cell nucleus measure use computer-driven microscope quantitative image analysis software . Increases nuclear area , diameter perimeter less uniform roundness nuclei know associate breast cancer higher grade . These kind measure also measure breast biopsy either normal hyperplastic , woman large nuclei completely benign breast biopsy likely develop breast cancer 1-33 year later . One factor may affect shape nucleus breast cell level oxidative stress breast . The breast fluid rich fat , lipid , certain kind lipid easily oxidize . NAF also contain vitamin obtain fruit vegetable function antioxidant stop lipid oxidation . For example , carotenoid react harmful oxidant form oxidized carotenoid . We therefore measure level one lipid peroxidation marker one oxidize carotenoid NAF marker oxidative stress . We also measure fatty acid level level un-oxidized carotenoid . We determine difference composition NAF related measure nuclear shape make breast cell . The breast NAF blood analyze cholesterol use spectrophotometric kit . Fatty acid analyze use gas chromatography . Total 8-isoprostanes analyze immunoassay kit . Micronutrients vitamins analyzed high pressure liquid chromatography . Nuclear morphology analyze computer-driven microscope . DNA damage breast cell analyze use gel electrophoresis lysed cell ( comet assay ) . Statistical analysis allow u determine NAF blood measure related nuclear measure .</detailed_description>
