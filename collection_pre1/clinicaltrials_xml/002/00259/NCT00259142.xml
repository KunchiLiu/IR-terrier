	<brief_summary>Malaria remain major cause morbidity mortality particularly among child &lt; 5 year Uganda . Due inaccessibility many child die reach health facility . The Home Based Management Fever ( HBMF ) strategy adopt Uganda mean improve access early appropriate treatment fever community level . Pre-packed chloroquine sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( HOMAPAK ) provide Community Drug Distributors ( CDDs ) . Initial evaluation show underutilization CDDs ( 15 % ) . This cast doubt community acceptability , accessibility well feasibility cost effectiveness . This 3-year project intend compare community acceptability cost effectiveness two HOMAPAK distribution method . The current CDD-based HOMAPAK distribution versus home-based HOMAPAK distribution . The study hypothesis `` home-based HOMAPAK distribution acceptable community cost effective CDD base HOMAPAK A non randomise community study conduct two sub-counties Mukono district . In control arm , HOMAPAKs distribute CDDs intervention arm , HOMAPAKs directly distribute caretaker home . The study population caretaker child &lt; 5 year . At baseline survey ( Phase 1 ) sample size 657 study area ass common drug stock home treat malaria health seek behaviour malaria child &lt; 5 year determine prevalence malaria parasitaemia anaemia among child &lt; 5 year . Phase 2 include intervention . The village assign either control intervention arm . Anaemia malaria parasitaemia among child fever assess active case finding . The impact either distribution system accessibility , acceptability , sustainability , compliance , cost effectiveness malaria morbidity assess evaluation phase . Health education message malaria prevention treatment give community . Drug misuse limit distribute HOMAPAKs accord number child &lt; 5years household .

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis distribute HOMAPAK directly caretakers acceptable community , cost effective result reduce malaria morbidity among child &lt; 5 year distribution CDDs . General Objective : To compare community malaria seek behaviour two drug distribution method HOMAPAK order provide information use enhance HBMF strategy . Specific Objectives : 1 . To assess trend types number antimalarial stock use among child &lt; 5 year two study area 2 . To assess pattern health seek behaviour community fever among child five year age . 3 . To assess incidence malaria , associate morbidity ( anaemia ) two study area . 4 . To compare community acceptability two drug distribution method HOMAPAK aspect , utilisation service , drug compliance , coverage accessibility . 5 . To assess cost compare cost effectiveness two drug distribution method HOMAPAK malaria morbidity community . Study area population : The study conduct Kayunga district , locate 80 km northeast Kampala total population 800000 ( Uganda Housing Population Census , 2002 ) 20 % &lt; 5 year . It hyperendemic malaria . The study population consist child &lt; 5 year caretaker . The study area without HOMAPAK distribute . Study design : Household base intervention study . Two drug distribution method HOMAPAK compare . In Control arm , HOMAPAKs distribute conventional HOMAPAK distribution method ( i.e CDDs ) Intervention arm , HOMAPAKs distribute directly caretaker . A Baseline survey ass pattern health seek behaviour &lt; 5 child fever . Types antimalarial stock home establish . The prevalence malaria anaemia among child &lt; 5 year establish . In intervention phase two different HOMAPAK distribution method implement monitor . Active case find malaria case combine passive surveillance . A structured questionnaire administer caretaker finger prick blood sample Hb malaria parasitaemia drawn child . Malaria record health facility review number malaria case see clinical outcome . In evaluation phase impact drug distribution method antimalarial stock home , health seek behaviour outcome measure . Sample size : Baseline evaluation phase The sample size ( n ) estimate accord Kirkwood Sterne ( 2003 ) compare two mean . The required sample size 597 per group . To cater loss follow , 10 % sample size add thus give total 657 per group . Methods The Intervention Phase The study population consist caretaker child five year age Control Intervention arm . Two CDDs village train give HOMAPAKs . In Control Arm CDDs keep HOMAPAKs distribute caretaker seek care child . In contrast intervention area , CDDs distribute drug home child &lt; 5 year age . The CDDs act RELAY POINTS HOMAPAKs . All village study parish either arm include . Activities : Community sensitisation/selection CDDs Through village meeting community inform project request select two people train CDDs . Two district trainer conduct train workshop . Item include : role CDD , issue malaria ( importance , cause , clinical presentation , case management &amp; prevention ) , HOMAPAK dosage , counsel ( preventive , compliance ) , referral case , record keep ( HMIS , drug stock ) , recognition child fever her/him , determine pre-pack give , record treatment drug storage . Procurement distribution HOMAPAK HOMAPAKs procure MoH supply CDDs study community . The CDDs control arm give drug caretaker seek care , intervention arm distribute appropriate HOMAPAKs HH child &lt; 5 year . In order prevent drug misuse , CDDs intervention group instruct replenish stock household caretaker produce use packet HOMAPAK . Monitoring case malaria Three field assistant ( FAs ) station community weekly survey households child either malaria history fever previous 7 day . A case malaria child , either currently fever ( axillary temperature &gt; 37.5 C ) parasitaemia ) history fever 48 hour prior survey plus parasitaemia . Information regard health-seeking behaviour caretaker child fever related cost obtain use questionnaire . Finger prick blood sample Hb malaria parasitaemia take child . The Hb obtain use portable haemoglobin photometer ( HemoCue ) thick malaria slide examine microscope . The FAs give appropriate information regard malaria control treatment caretaker . Monitoring Supervision project activity Project activity monitor supervised project staff , district health team , community . The project staff join district team quarterly support supervision visit . The PI district supervisor fortnightly supervision study area . During supervisory visit , meeting CDDs community leader hold discuss progress project activity . Meetings also hold FAs Field Supervisors . Patient record drug stock card health facility CDDs review . The Evaluation Phase : To assess impact distribution method pattern health seek behaviour caretaker fever among child &lt; 5 year , acceptability relate cost household government , antimalarial stock home , malaria morbidity among child &lt; 5 year , second KAP Survey conduct 2 year implementation project , village , comparable sample 657 caretaker child &lt; 5 year study area use structure questionnaire FGD guide . Sampling : Two sub county ( SC ) district similar demographic socio-economic characteristic purposely select . 50 % parish SC randomly select . Baseline Evaluation phase : In order least 30 household ( HH ) village , total 17 village select sampled parish sub county use probability proportionate size sampling . At village level list HH village obtain chairman village . The 30HH select randomly . Appointments make caretaker agree time interview . In case caretaker refuse participate , replace . In case select HH child &lt; 5 year , replace one neighbourhood child . In case one eligible caretaker select HH like polygamous home , one respondent select use ballot method . A similar procedure apply case one eligible child HH . After seek informed consent respondent , interview conducted.Participants FGDs purposely select parish HH part structure questionnaire . Two FGDs men Two woman conduct separately . Intervention phase : All household child &lt; 5 year study village control intervention arm Outcome Measures : Patterns health seek behaviour - Types health service use , factor affect utilisation formal health service ( individual , community , health system base etc ) Utilisation antimalarial community - Types antimalarial drug use malaria among five child - Number antimalarial drug use treatment episode fever - % change type number antimalarial drug stock home Acceptability - Proportion under-five child fever give HOMAPAKS - Proportion caretaker use HOMAPAKS first choice treatment fever - Proportion caretaker able correctly use HOMAPAKs Accessibility - Proportion child get treatment HOMAPAK within 24 hour onset fever - % week year without stock-outs HOMAPAKs - % drug distributor always available - % household HOMAPAKS future episodes fever Feasibility/Sustainability - % distributors/households satisfactory drug storage , % household expire HOMAPAK Compliance - Proportion febrile under-five child get appropriate treatment - % caretaker show correct dosage child - % under-five child give HOMAPAK fever/malaria - proportion five get appropriate referral Coverage - Proportion five child fever get treatment HOMAPAK Cost &amp; cost-effectiveness - Average cost incur MoH deliver HOMAPAK HH level - Average cost incurred MoH treatment severe malaria case health facility - Average Costs incur house hold level seek care case malaria - Average cost household treat case severe malaria health facility - Cost effective ratio case severe malaria avert health facility level - Cost effective ratio case blood transfusion avert health facility level Malaria morbidity - % increase mean Hb level - % decrease prevalence intensity parasitaemia - % decrease severe malaria case ( HIS )</detailed_description>
