	<brief_summary>This study test safety efficacy TroVax patient undergo surgical resection colorectal cancer liver metastasis . TroVax potentially work encourage immune system react 5T4 protein surface bowel cancer cell . The immune system able recognise 5T4 kill cell carry . The hope tumour cell start grow main tumour surgically remove , immune system would able find destroy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect TroVax Patients Having Colorectal Cancer With Liver Metastases Removed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment metastatic colorectal cancer depend site disease . The prognosis patient poor although cure obtain disease localise operable . Patients metastatic disease confine liver may achieve cure rate 20 % 60 % metastasis resited , risk micrometastatic disease persist post-operatively . TroVax consist highly attenuate vaccinia virus ( modify vaccinia Ankara ) contain human tumour associate antigen ST4 . The human oncofetal antigen 5T4 surface glycoprotein express placental tissue , also wide range human carcinoma include colorectal renal carcinoma . 5T4 exhibit low level expression normal tissue thus suitable target immune therapy cancer . This study evaluate first time man immunological effect TroVax vaccine locally within target tumour peripheral blood . Tolerability vaccine also assess . Patients receive 2 intramuscular injection TroVax 2 week interval follow surgery 10 day later . Two vaccination give 4 8 week surgery . Patients show response first four vaccination give 2 additional vaccination 20 28 week post surgery .</detailed_description>
