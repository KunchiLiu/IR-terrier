Hypothesis : Caregivers intervention group report decrease frequency occurrence target behavior 4-months comparison caregiver control group . 4 . Test maintenance effect intervention 6-months caregiver upset burden target disruptive behavior . Hypothesis : Compared usual care , caregiver intervention maintain reduced upset burden report less occurrence target behavior 4 6-months . 5 . Assess cost intervention cost effectiveness . We also receive funding conduct supplementary study evaluate effect nurse intervention behavior reduction caregiver distress .

	<criteria>Caregivers eligible study participation : family member 21 year age old ( male female ) , live care recipient , able participate interview English telephone home , plan live area 6 month , report high level upset behavior follow . We use Agitated Behavior Dementia Scale ( ABID ) ,62 16item psychometrically valid scale behavioral occurrence associate caregiver upset . We choose scale six primary scale use measure behavior give behavior closely match intent intervention plan test . The behavior include list earlier plus one additional behavior , repetitive vocalization . For 17 behavior occur past week ( purpose screen eligibility , use yes/no response format ) , caregiver ask level upset ( 0 = , 1 = little , 2 = moderately , 3 = much 4 = extremely ) . Caregivers consider eligible obtain total sum score `` 3 '' high use follow algorithm : Caregivers must report least one behavior ( `` 3 '' ) extremely ( `` 4 '' ) upset , caregiver must report three behavior one behavior cause least moderate ( `` 2 '' ) level upset one behavior cause least little upset . Thus , caregiver score `` 1 '' ( little upset ) three behavioral occurrence consider eligible study . That , criterion exclude caregiver upset little upset . We also require care recipient : 1 ) NINCDSADRDA diagnosis ( physician generate ) dementia Minimental State Examination ( MMSE ) score &lt; 23 . A caregiver exclude caregiver care recipient : terminal illness life expectancy &lt; 6 month , active treatment cancer , &gt; 3 acute medical hospitalization past year . Caregivers also exclude : currently involve another clinical trial psychosocial educational intervention caregiver ; plan place family member nursing home within next 6months . Carerecipients also exclude : schizophrenia bipolar disorder , dementia secondary probable head trauma , MMSE score = 0 consider bedbound , define confinement bed chair least 22 hour day least four previous seven day , nurse home admission plan occur within six month enrol clinical trial pharmacological treatment agitation . These criterion exclude caregiver ADRD patient severe stage disease process may benefit propose intervention .</criteria>
