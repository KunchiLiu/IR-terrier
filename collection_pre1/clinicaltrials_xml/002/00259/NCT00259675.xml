	<brief_title>Alternating Cycles Carboplatin/Gemcitabine Carboplatin/Taxol Advanced Stage NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death men woman USA , account 28 % cancer death 2002 ( 1 ) . In stage IV patient stage III disease chemotherapy widely use primary aim prolong survival /or palliating symptom . A meta analysis clinical study randomize patient best supportive care chemotherapy conclude Cisplatin base chemotherapy result potential gain median survival increase 1-year survival rate compare supportive care alone ( 2 ) . Combination chemotherapy regimen ( Platinum/Taxanes , Platinum/Gemcitabine , Platinum/Vinca alkaloid ) demonstrate response rate 30-50 % median survival approximately 10 month , one year survival rate around 40 % , 2 year survival 10 % patient advance Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) ( 3,4 ) . Therefore important continue search new agents/combinations use improve overall prognosis patient . Rationale use alternate cycle chemotherapy : Emergence progressive recurrent disease consequence selection overgrowth pre-existent , drug resistant cell treatment . Based mechanism somatic cell mutation , Goldie Coldman ( 5,6 ) propose model emergence drug resistant cell tumor . Their model propose alternate non-cross-resistant combination would prevent overgrowth resistant cancer cell improve probability tumor control cure . Their recommendation assume two non-cross-resistant regimen equal similar efficacy drug contain two combination could administer together one single regimen . There instance Clinical Oncology two regimen similar efficacy exist tumor type . Since apparently equivalent chemotherapy regimen exist treatment NSCLC , Goldie Coldman hypothesis could also test tumor type . Historically , SWOG conduct phase III trial randomize patient FOMi ( 5-Fluorouracil/Vincristine/MitomycinC ) , CAP ( Cyclophosphamide/Doxorubicin/Cisplatin ) third arm FOMi/CAP , alternate two combination . Response rate 26 % , 17 % 22 % , respectively , statistically significantly different ( P=0 .247 ) . Survival report 20 , 24 23 week , respectively . Statistically survival FOMi/CAP treat patient superior FOMi treat ( P=0.024 ) CAP treat ( P=0.23 ) patient ( 7 ) . Since , several study attempt improve upon response rate survival advance NSCLC use regimen alternate cycle non-cross-resistant therapy ( 8,9,10,11 ) . These regimen yield overall response rate 21-49 % , median survival 20-48 wks acceptable toxicity . Though several study do evaluate clinical response lung cancer use alternate chemotherapy , none study evaluate clinical response alternate Paclitaxel Gemcitabine base treatment two effective chemotherapy regimen use currently . In study Platinum combination include one agent , result well achieve Platinum alone combine early generation agent Vindesine Etoposide ( 12 ) . Current evidence suggest combination Paclitaxel Gemcitabine Cisplatin Carboplatin among active palliative treatment advance NSCLC . With combination Cisplatin Gemcitabine response rate phase II trial range 30-54 % , median survival time approximately 8-15 month I year survival rate 34-61 % ( 13,14 ) . Myelosuppression major toxicity , Cisplatin associate nonhematologic gastrointestinal , renal neurologic effect also problematic . Attempts reduce toxicity associate Cisplatin/ Gemcitabine regimen include replace Cisplatin Carboplatin , platinum analog possess similar efficacy hematologic effect , lack non hematologic toxicity commonly experience Cisplatin therapy ( 15,16 ) . Furthermore Carboplatin administer need prehydration avoid renal toxicity . In several phase II study Carboplatin/Gemcitabine regimen patient stage IIIB IV NSCLC , objective response rate range 25 % -59 % , median survival 10-16 month ( 17,18 ) . In phase II trial , Carrato et al ( 19 ) compare 21 day 28-day schedule Gemcitabine/Carboplatin regimen 75 advanced NSCLC patient . Patients receive Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 day 1,8 15 Carboplatin AUC 5 day 1 every 28 day , modify regimen omit day 15 Gemcitabine dose repeat cycle every 21 day . Incidence grade 3 4 neutropenia 52 % 38 % , respectively 28 day regimen , decrease 39 % 23 % modified regimen . Significant reduction rate grade 3 4 thrombocytopenia note 45 % 61 % , respectively , 28 day cohort 24 % ( P=0.04 ) 17 % ( P=0.002 ) respectively , 21 day group . Response rate ( 46 % 37 % , respectively ) median survival time ( 38 wks schedule ) maintain group patient . Furthermore , high dose intensity Gemcitabine Carboplatin achieve every 3 wk v every 4 wk schedule ( Gemcitabine 1,133 v 1,002 mg/wk : Carboplatin 162 v 124 mg/wk ) ( 20 ) . Results current phase III trial ( 21,22 ) also consistent show good activity tolerability Carboplatin/Gemcitabine combination advance NSCLC , establish regimen appeal approach treat disease . On basis discussion choose Carboplatin/Gemcitabine one doublets use study . The doublet use study Carboplatin/Paclitaxel . Several study show response rate approximately 30 % median survival 8-11 month ( 23,24,25 ) . Toxicity mild . Grades 3,4 neutropenia , thrombocytopenia anemia see 15 % , 2 % 5 % respectively ( 25 ) . Dose find study ( 26,27 ) Paclitaxel Carboplatin advance NSCLC show dos Paclitaxel high 175 mg/m2 prolongs median time progression cause neurotoxicity leucopenia . Also , good response rate , long overall well one-year survival see high dose Paclitaxel statistically significant . Rationale use Gemcitabine Paclitaxel ( alternatively regimen ) NSCLC provide antitumor activity , different mechanism cytotoxicity different toxicity profile . In in-vitro study ( 28 ) Jensen PB et al show collateral sensitivity Paclitaxel Gemcitabine seven resistant small cell lung cancer cell line . The importance evaluate impact therapy quality life ( QOL ) patient malignancy demonstrate recent literature ( 29 ) . Patients advance NSCLC suffer variety treatment related challenge expectation cure . Hence , particularly important compare treatment alternative survival endpoint also QOL . Therefore , propose incorporate QOL evaluation propose clinical trial . QOL instrument use FACT-L ( version 4 ) . The FACT-L validated 36-item Likert instrument combine relative frequency symptomatic/quality life problem patient perceive relative importance issue ( 30 ) . Can use Taxotere second line agent patient receive Paclitaxel first line agent ? In comparison best supportive care , Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) show benefit overall survival second line treatment NSCLC ( 31,32 ) . Patients prior exposure paclitaxel exclude TAX 317 trial ( 29 ) . But TAX 320 trial ( 30 ) many patient receive Paclitaxel prior enrollment ( 31 % patient Docetaxel 100 mg arm , 42 % patient Docetaxel 75 mg arm 41 % patient control arm . Authors able evaluate retrospectively , impact , , prior Paclitaxel exposure may response survival Docetaxel . Partial response rate equivalent cohort 91 patient receive prior Paclitaxel ( 10.5 % ) group 157 patient receive prior Paclitaxel ( 8.5 % ) . In similar analysis survival data , prior Paclitaxel therapy bearing survival advantage see Docetaxel .</detailed_description>
