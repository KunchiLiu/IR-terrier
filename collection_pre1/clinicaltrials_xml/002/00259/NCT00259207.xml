	<brief_title>Pulmonary Valve Replacement Large Right Ventricular Outflow Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary regurgitation common complication late complete correction tetralogy Fallot . It progressively lead right ventricular dilatation strongly associate ventricular arrhythmia , sudden death right ventricular insufficiency . Pulmonary valve replacement reduces rate complication precise timing procedure remain unknown . Moreover , pulmonary valve replacement , even occurrence symptom , n't allow total recovery patient . Reasons know , cardiopulmonary bypass well late referral surgery incriminate explain persistence right ventricular dysfunction surgical valvular . Therefore , strategy avoid cardiopulmonary bypass could potentially preserve right ventricular function meantime reduce hospitalisation length morbid-mortality . For last six year , others develop technique percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation . Encouraging result report treatment fail right ventricular pulmonary artery conduit , present indication limit innovative technique could offer patient require pulmonary valve replacement . In particular , date , conventional surgery approach patient large pulmonary trunk 22 mm diameter . We idea collaborate surgeon try improve outcome valvular patient . We would like investigate hybrid strategy patient large right ventricular outflow tract inaccessible solely transcatheter technique . The studied technique associate surgical pulmonary artery banding without cardiopulmonary bypass immediately follow transventricular transvenous pulmonary valve insertion use conventional valved stent . The purpose randomize study evaluate benefit risk medico-surgical hybrid strategy , compare strategy hybrid approach conventional surgery extracorporeal circulation term right ventricular function recovery .</detailed_description>
