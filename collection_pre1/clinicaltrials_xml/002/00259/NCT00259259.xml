	<detailed_description>Background Obesity major health problem worldwide , risk factor several chronic disorder . Even small change energy intake , lead positive balance may lead weight gain time . Thus , slight modification food intake , inclusion food effect energy balance , may prevent weight gain even facilitate weight loss . Replacing dietary fat low-calorie fat ( LCF ) , modify triglyceride medium long chain PUFA.may efficient way reduce body fat . Bray et al . ( 2002 ) show sustained weight loss ~6 kg 9 month period one-third fat-reduced diet ( 25 % fat ) replace olestra . This weight loss solely explain decreased caloric content olestra . Thus , inhibition appetite lead low food intake , may potential mechanism observed weight loss . A reduced absorption LCF leave undigested fatty acid middle low intestine , may generate increased feeling satiety decrease caloric intake due regulate peptide hormone ( CCK , GLP-1 , etc. ) . In addition , intraduodenal fatty acid may also promote distension stomach distension intestine , well-known gastrointestinal signal control mechanism food intake . Taken together , addition acute reduction caloric intake , LCF may encourage gastrointestinal hormone response promote beneficial effect appetite regulation energy balance . Aims To evaluate short-term effect LCF Primary : - Appetite sensation meal ( VAS ) - Postprandiel secretion appetite regulate hormone - Ad libitum caloric intake 4,5-h subsequent fix meal Secondary : â€¢ Palatability test meal</detailed_description>
