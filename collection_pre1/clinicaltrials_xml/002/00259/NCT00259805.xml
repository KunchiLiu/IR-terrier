	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Use Rituximab Treatment Chronic Focal Encephalitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Focal Encephalitis ( Rasmussen 's Encephalitis ) condition characterize progressive hemiparesis , cognitive decline ( include loss language skills language dominant hemisphere involve ) epileptic seizure typically refractory medical treatment ( Rasmussen ) . Attempts control seizures anticonvulsant ineffective effective treatment date hemispherectomy ( surgical removal half brain ) . Children CFE undergo cortical resection hemispherectomies demonstrate inflammatory histopathology consist perivascular lymphocytic cuffing , gliosis , neuronal loss , microglial nodule later laminar necrosis spongy degeneration Rituximab genetically engineer , chimeric ; murine/human monoclonal antibody direct CD20 antigen find surface normal malignant pre-B mature B cell . It approve FDA 1997 treatment relapse refractory low grade follicular , CD20+ , B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) . Rituximab bind specifically CD20 antigen express surface normal malignant pre-B mature B cell . In vitro mechanism action study demonstrate Fc portion Rituximab bind human complement lead cell lysis target cell complement-dependent cytotoxicity . Additionally , demonstrate Rituximab significant activity assay antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( Reff et al . 1994 ) . More recently , Rituximab show induce apoptosis vitro DHL-4 , human B cell lymphoma line ( Maloney et al . 1997 ) . The relative extent individual mechanism account observe depletion normal malignant B cell vivo unknown . While CFE represent small percentage patient epilepsy , devastate progressive nature disease adequate treatment , relegate child relentless loss cognitive motor skill , continue seizure . Recent evidence suggest condition immune mediate include development antibody direct various brain component include glutamate receptor ( GluR3 ) ( Rogers ) . Brain sample patient CFE demonstrate immunoreactivity IgG , C4 C8 , MAC ( Andrews Whitney ) involvement B T-lymphocytes . Evidence support role clonally expand B lymphocytes find Baranzini . By analyze T-cell receptor expression brain lesion use PCR investigator also demonstrate local immune response CFE include restrict T-cell population probably expand precursor T-cells respond discrete antigenic epitope ( Li ) . Following demonstration antibody direct brain element CFE , patient treat plasma exchange produce significant improvement seizure frequency , cognition hemiparesis , lend support hypothesis circulate antibody contribute disease pathogenesis . Subsequently attempt modify disease immune modification ( plasmaphoresis , steroid , gamma globulin ) demonstrate modest improvement improvement short-lived affected natural progression disease . This pilot study propose directly attack cell ( B-cells ) think instrumental development condition . Should approach treat CFE successful major impact child 's life .</detailed_description>
