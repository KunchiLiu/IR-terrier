	<brief_summary>This Phase I , dose escalation study EM-1421 administer intravenous infusion ( IV ) five consecutive day every 28 day patient solid tumor refractory current therapy . There previous human study intravenous ( one 's vein ) EM-1421 treatment ; however , lab research ( research test tube and/or animal ) suggest EM-1421 show activity tumor animal . This activity animal model suggest EM-1421 may useful chemotherapy human cancer . The primary objective study determine safety maximum tolerate dose EM-1421 give intravenous infusion . The efficacy treatment also measure .</brief_summary>
