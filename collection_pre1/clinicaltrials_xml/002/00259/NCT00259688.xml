	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The prevalence sleep apnea great pregnant woman preeclampsia pregnant woman without preeclampsia.The presence sleep apnea associate poor blood pressure control , worsen blood pressure sleep evidence fetal distress . The usual treatment sleep apnea patient breathe pressurize air mask . This call continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . In preeclamptic woman sleep apnea , use CPAP result improve blood pressure control reduce fetal distress .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Study Sleep Apnea Women With Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea common adult population . In middle age men , presence sleep apnea correlate hypertension , cardiovascular disease mood disorder . Sleep apnea well study woman even less known sleep apnea pregnant woman . However , preliminary evidence suggest incidence quite high , particularly woman severe preeclampsia . We propose perform sleep study 30 woman preeclampsia 30 healthy pregnant control . In addition usual sleep study monitoring , also measure beat-to-beat blood pressure non-invasive monitoring continuous electronic fetal monitoring . Women find sleep apnea repeat study CPAP therapy apply , provide CPAP therapy nightly use home .</detailed_description>
