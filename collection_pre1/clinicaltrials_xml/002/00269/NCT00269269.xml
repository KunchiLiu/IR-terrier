	<brief_title>Conditioned Placebo Effects Treatment Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study compare unconditioned conditioned effect placebo capsule treatment patient borderline hypertension ( BH ) . The use placebos routine trial antihypertensive medication , placebo nearly always give active drug , study rely traditional clinic measurement blood pressure ( BP ) . However , ambulatory BP monitoring ( ABPM ) gold standard evaluate effectiveness antihypertensive treatment , placebo effect ABP mostly negligible . However , also evidence placebo give active drug , may profound effect . A long series animal human study co-principal investigator ( Dr. Ader ) show learn classically condition placebo effect may genuinely therapeutic effect . One study , provide basis current study , find placebo give active drug lower home BP , ABP evaluate . The current study extend previous one , perform Community Health Centers , culturally diverse , economically disadvantage population . 120 patient untreated BH BPs monitor clinic , home , ABP record . After 4-week run-in period telephone-linked home monitoring ( continue throughout study ) randomize 3 group : drug , active drug ( beta blocker-diuretic combination ) , match placebo . This enable evaluation unconditioned placebo effect . For next 4 week 3 group receive active drug . ABPM clinic BP measure end period . For final period patient group randomize drug placebo . ABPM clinic BP measure 2 week , home BP continue BP return 140/90 mmHg . It hypothesize condition placebo effect result delay return BP pretreatment level , inclusion No Drug group distinguish effect drug washout . To promote assess compliance medication , electronic container ( MEMscaps ) use . The demonstration condition placebo effect produce sustain reduction BP could result economical treatment few side effect .</detailed_description>
