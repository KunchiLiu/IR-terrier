	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Epoetin Alfa Versus Placebo Patients With Persistent Anemia Result Cancer Treatment With Cisplatin , Platinum-containing Chemotherapy Drug</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing treatment cisplatin-containing chemotherapy frequently develop significant anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; = 10.5 grams/deciliter ) . Agents increase amount hemoglobin cancer patient undergoing treatment cisplatin-containing cyclic chemotherapy may improve patient ' reduce physical strength reduce stamina result anemia , increase patient ' ability continue chemotherapy , improve patient ' overall qualify life . Epoetin alfa genetically engineer form natural hormone ( erythropoietin ) use treat anemia stimulate red blood cell production . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multicenter study . This study evaluate safety effectiveness epoetin alfa treat patient develop persistent anemia result treatment aggressive cisplatin-containing cyclic chemotherapy ( every 3 4 week ) cancer type ( except rapid severe onset leukemias malignancy bone marrow spleen ) . The study consist &lt; = 7 day screening period patient ' eligibility determine , 12-week double-blind treatment period , optional open-label treatment period . Eligible patient randomly assign one two treatment group : epoetin alfa 150 units/kilogram comparable volume placebo , give injection beneath skin . Patients treat study medication 3 time weekly 12 week . Two 3 weekly dos study medication may self-administered patient home ; patient visit health professional least weekly administer dose ( ) . The dose study medication may increase decreased discretion physician , base result blood test . Depending patient 's chemotherapy cycle , return study site every 3 4 week administration study medication . During open-label treatment period , patient choose continue receive 3 injection per week epoetin alfa skin , completion chemotherapy treatment . Safety evaluation , include laboratory test , vital sign , report adverse event , physical examination , electrocardiogram , perform throughout study . Effectiveness study drug determine number transfusion patient require change blood test result ( hemoglobin , hematocrit , immature red blood cell ) start study end study . The study hypothesis epoetin alfa , effectively placebo , stimulate adequate production red blood cell elevate hemoglobin level cancer patient anemic result undergo treatment aggressive cisplatin-containing cyclic chemotherapy . Double-blind : Epoetin alfa 150 units/kilogram , match volume placebo , inject beneath skin 3 time weekly 12 week . Open-label : Epoetin alfa dose receive end double-blind study inject beneath skin 3 time weekly remain cycle chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
