	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study design build ACCESS Study , prospective pregnancy cohort study begin 2003 cohort birth age four . The present study include two new aim regard interaction stress genetic environmental variable , reflect comprehensive conceptualization multiple mechanism stress contribute asthma . In addition , current study proposes follow cohort age three . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study examine role psychosocial stressor system biology framework consider multiple biologic pathway stress contribute asthma . The investigator study independent effect stress asthma/wheeze phenotypes early childhood also consider stress modifier physical environmental factor ( allergen , cigarette smoking , diesel-related air pollutant ) genetic predisposition asthma risk . They determine independent effect maternal stress ( prenatal postnatal ) early childhood asthma phenotype . They hypothesize multi-life stressor prevalent disadvantage population cumulatively influence immune system development airway inflammation early life , thus make population susceptible environmental factor genetic risk factor explain , part , observe asthma disparity associate SES race/ethnicity . They take multi-level approach , measure individual-level stress ( negative life event , perceive stress , pregnancy anxiety ) community-level stress [ neighborhood disadvantage ( e.g. , percent subject live poverty , percent unemployed ) , diminish social capital , high crime/violence rate ] . They also assess influence stress infant hormonal stress response T-helper cell differentiation reflect cytokine profile IgE expression ( topic pro inflammatory phenotype ) . Additional physical environmental ( indoor allergen , diesel-related air pollutant , tobacco smoke ) genetic factor assess give influence immune response expression early childhood asthma/wheeze . This interdisciplinary approach unique researcher consider context physical exposure host susceptibility occur , analyze multiplicative joint effect consider multiple biologic pathway , consistent NIH roadmap objective .</detailed_description>
