	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Oral Levofloxacin Compared With Cefuroxime Axetil Treatment Adults With Persistent Bronchitis Experiencing Rapid Onset Severe Worsening Symptoms Caused Bacteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , parallel group , multicenter study determine safety effectiveness 500 mg levofloxacin ( daily 5 - 7 day ) compare 250 mg cefuroxime axetil ( every 12 hour 10 day ) adults chronic bronchitis experience rapid onset severe worsen symptom cause bacteria . The study consist 3 visit : one visit screen enrollment , 2 visit assessment safety effectiveness ( one visit Days 3 - 5 study one visit [ post-therapy ] 5 - 7 day last dose study drug ) . The total duration patient participation study approximately 2 week . The primary efficacy assessment clinical response 5 - 7 day last dose study drug , ( categorize cure , improve , fail ) base upon change sign symptom . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , physical examination , laboratory test ) perform throughout study . The study hypothesis treatment levofloxacin least effective well tolerate treatment cefuroxime axetil adult patient chronic bronchitis experience sudden worsening symptom cause bacterial infection . Levofloxacin 500 mg mouth daily 5 - 7 day , cefuroxime axetil 250 mg mouth every 12 hour 10 day</detailed_description>
