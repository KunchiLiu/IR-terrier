At National Naval Medical Center , well-established treatment option , full array technique employ , primarily painful condition , often back pain . This study seek clarify mechanisms action efficacy one specific treatment option , prone distraction , relief subacute sciatica due radiographically confirm herniated disc , compare side-posture manipulation standard medical management . Prone lumbar distraction utilize specialize table motorize continual motion distraction . This table multiple mechanical articulation use place patient wide variety position . Patients treat continuous motion distraction place prone table position maximum comfort centralization symptom . Side posture manipulation widely practice , standard chiropractic technique , show provide considerable clinical improvement patient sciatica .
