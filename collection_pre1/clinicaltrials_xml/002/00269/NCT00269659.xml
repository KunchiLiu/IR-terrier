	<brief_summary>A left bundle branch block ( LBBB ) relate abnormal cardiac conduction mechanical asynchrony associate hypertension coronary artery disease . Improved evaluation leave ventricular ( LV ) mechanical asynchrony need , increase number patient LBBB heart failure . A variety pattern mechanical activation observe LBBB patient . Novel image modality tissue Doppler imaging , real-time 3D echocardiography cardiovascular magnetic resonance image provide information regional global LV function healthy subject , patient without LBBB heart failure , patient LBBB without heart failure , patient LBBB heart failure . The investigator want evaluate different patient group novel image modality want compare novel image modality . The investigator hypothesize , group , difference concern regional global LV function measurable . Each novel imaging technique advantage limitation comparable measure regional global LV function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Effects Left Bundle Branch Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within time period 3 year evaluate different group patient measure regional global cardiac function . Therefore , develop echocardiography screening-protocol use conventional 2D echocardiography conventional Doppler echocardiography , extend tissue Doppler image real-time 3D echo acquisition . In limited group patient perform specially design cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging protocol use artificially induced grid-lines evaluate regional global cardiac function . Patients refer hospital evaluation LBBB heart failure . We ask would like undergo echocardiography cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging . After year want repeat measurement small group patient re-evaluate regional global cardiac function . All patient sinus rhythm adequate acoustic window . Patients contraindication cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging .</detailed_description>
