	<brief_title>Increasing Adherence Asthma Medication Urban Teens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Low-income , minority teenager disproportionately high rate asthma morbidity , include excess risk emergency department ( ED ) care , hospitalization , death asthma , compare white adolescent . Research group others document non-adherence asthma treatment regimens common among high-risk , inner city family asthma , poor adherence prescribe therapy play significant contribute role asthma morbidity . Inner-city adolescent asthma particular risk non-adherence , yet population remain understudied . While asthma self-management training show promise achieve improvement adherence asthma , intervention study explicitly target adolescent , particularly inner-city . Urban child typically assume primary control asthma management late childhood/early adolescence . At time , adolescent ' effort achieve autonomy peer-acceptance may result increase health risk behavior , include poor asthma self-management . Developmentally-appropriate asthma self-management intervention need target unique challenge adolescence . Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) promise interventional approach use client-centered , non-directive approach enhance motivation change health behavior . MI techniques developmentally consistent need early adolescent . MI assume health important factor motivate teen , rather acknowledge incorporates motivator within context teen 's life , thus intervention strategy flexibility adapt unique life circumstance stressor face urban adolescent . We propose evaluate relative effectiveness MI-focused self-management intervention ( MI+SM ) compare self-management ( SM ) intervention contain asthma education self-monitoring strategy sample 226 child age 10-15 year treat asthma ED . Our primary hypothesis MI+SM , compare SM alone , result great improvement medication adherence 3- 6-months post-randomization , measure electronic medication monitoring . Secondary outcome include self-reported medication adherence , symptom free day , urgent health care utilization asthma , caregiver/adolescent quality life . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Participants randomly assign 1 ) Self-Management ( SM ; Standard Care Group ) 2 ) Motivational Interviewing plus Self-Management Training ( MI+SM ; Intervention Group ) . The duration intervention condition 5 home visit 2 month . Follow-up measure collect family 3- 6-months post-randomization .</detailed_description>
