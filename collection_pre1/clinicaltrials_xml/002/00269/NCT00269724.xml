	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy OROS® Oxybutynin Chloride Treatment Urge Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence refers involuntary loss urine sufficient amount consider social health problem . It under-reported under-treated patient often ashamed embarrassed discuss condition clinician may also fail ask patient incontinence . This multi-center , open-label study include dose conversion dose determination evaluate safety OROS® oxybutynin chloride clinically acceptable dose . There three study period : Run-in , Dose Conversion/Determination , Maintenance . During 1-week Run-in Period , baseline incontinence , urinary frequency , health relate quality-of-life data collect . During Dose Conversion/Determination Period , previous urge urinary incontinence medication discontinue patient start OROS® oxybutynin chloride . The dose titrate clinically acceptable dose 5-mg increment 7 ± 3 day interval possible maximum dose 30 mg/day . The clinically acceptable dose define either minimum effective dose ( i.e. , dose patient incontinent episode last 2 day dose interval ) dose provide best balance symptomatic improvement side effect . Patients take immediate-release oxybutynin enrollment start dose titration OROS® oxybutynin chloride dose equal immediate-release oxybutynin dose ; others start 5 mg per day OROS® ( oxybutynin chloride ) . After clinically acceptable dose establish , patient continue additional week dose confirm appropriate . Then patient enters 12-week Maintenance Period evaluate whether urge urinary incontinence reduction achieve begin maintenance persist . The primary outcome study evaluation safety OROS® oxybutynin chloride . Safety assessment include incidence adverse event , physical examination medical history , clinical laboratory test , urinalysis , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , vital sign , Physician 's Anticholinergic Effects Assessment ( P-ACEA ) , assessment complete physician severe intolerable anticholinergic effect occur . OROS® oxybutynin chloride ( 5 mg 10 mg system ) : One five system take orally per day ( 5 mg per day maximum 30 mg per day ) single morning dose . The duration Maintenance Period study 12 week .</detailed_description>
