	<brief_title>Efficacy Fentanyl Transdermal Therapeutic System ( TTS ) Management Pain Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Moderate severe pain experienced one-third cancer patient intermediate stage disease . Currently used medication treatment moderate severe pain due cancer often provide inadequate pain relief require repeat oral administration narcotic . Providing prolonged , safe effective pain relief continuous basis would major therapeutic advance management cancer pain . This open-label pilot study evaluate safety effectiveness fentanyl Transdermal Therapeutic System ( TTS ) management chronic pain patient cancer . The initial dose fentanyl transdermal patch calculate base upon equi-analgesic potency ratio narcotic use prior study entry . Four dosage strength fentanyl transdermal patch available study medication , nominal delivery rate 100 , 75 , 50 25 microgram fentanyl per hour . Multiple transdermal patch wear high dos require . Morphine sulfate available need rescue medication treat breakthrough pain . After initial application , dose titrated patient within hospital set course 3 day , long necessary achieve adequate pain control . Changes dose titration occur frequently every 24 hour . After appropriate dose reach , transdermal patch replace every 72 hour new transdermal patch , apply fresh skin site . When discharge , patient enter 3-week program twice weekly nursing visit monitor patient progress . Patients evaluate designated time interval pain intensity , vital sign , serum fentanyl concentration . Records keep concomitant medication administer study adverse event . After completion 3-week program , patient give opportunity remain fentanyl Transdermal Therapeutic System ( TTS ) long-term treatment chronic pain . The TTS ( fentanyl ) transdermal patch start dose calculate base upon equi-analgesic potency ratio narcotic use prior study entry , titrate need achieve adequate pain control . The patch replace every 72 hour . The treatment phase 3 week .</detailed_description>
