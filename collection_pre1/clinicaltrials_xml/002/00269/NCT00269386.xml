	<detailed_description>WHAT IS THE PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED ? Lack effective cure Crohn 's disease . Effective symptomatic treatment Crohn 's disease achieve approximately 60-80 % use corticosteroid [ 1 ] similar response enteral intravenous feeding . The benefit usually short-term however , 50 % relapsing within year [ 2 ] 90 % patient ileocaecal disease eventually require least one surgical operation [ 3 ] . The cause Crohn 's disease unknown commonly believe due way bacteria : either unusual response normal intestinal flora possibly specific infection atypical bacterium . It typify histologically presence granuloma ( 75 % case ) closely resemble intestinal tuberculosis , radiologically histologically . A search Mycobacteria produce conflict result one centre claim Mycobacterium paratuberculosis DNA detect majority case [ 4 ] others find Mycobacterial DNA 10 % [ 5 ] . Studies show variety organism include normal intestinal bacteria yeast grow Crohn 's disease mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes within lymph node manufacture antibody direct broad range bacterial antigen widely hold view wide range micro-organisms invade mucosa Crohn 's disease , possibly result breakdown normal mucosal barrier [ 6 ] . WHAT IS THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED ? That clarithromycin may effective therapy Crohn 's disease . It broad spectrum antibiotic particularly good penetration macrophage [ 7 ] may therefore effective eradicate organism centre granulomatous reaction Crohn 's disease . There also evidence suggest macrolide antibiotic stimulate macrophage proliferation , phagocytosis , chemotaxis cytocidal activitity [ 8 ] . WHY IS A TRIAL NEEDED NOW ? Open label study show promising result Clarithromycin . A study publish abstract Present 's group New York report response 7/12 ( 58 % ) whose Crohn 's disease activity index ( CDAI ) fell mean 130 point ( range 79-130 ) response clarithromycin 500 mg bd 6 week [ 9 ] . HAS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW BEEN CARRIED OUT AND WHAT WERE THE FINDINGS ? A Medline search `` clarithromycin Crohn 's disease '' yield three response . The first report open-label study combination clarithromycin 250 mg bd ( azithromycin 3 patient ) rifabutin 450 mg per day give mean 18 month 52 patient St George 's Hospital group major protagonist Mycobacterium paratuberculosis hypothesis [ 10 ] . They report response term `` significant fall Harvey Bradshaw Index '' 93 % CDAI report many patient seem rather modest elevation Harvey Bradshaw index entry . Ten patient also receive quinolone antibiotic 5 received clofazimine . The two report clarithromycin Mycobacterium haemophilum infection include least one case apparent Crohn 's disease . Review American Gastroenterological Association abstract past three year yield reference [ 9 ] Australian study triple therapy regimen Mycobacteria consist rifabutin 450 mg per day , clarithromycin 750 mg per day , clofazimine 2 mg per kg . Twelve patient treat 8-12 month 10/12 achieve `` near complete control '' [ 11 ] . HOW WILL THE RESULTS OF THIS TRIAL BE USED ? This trial establish whether clarithromycin effective achieve remission Crohn 's disease would significant advance non-steroid treatment active Crohn 's disease . If significant positive result observe trial prolonged treatment would indicate assess clarithromycin 's effect prevention relapse . WHAT ARE THE PLANNED TRIAL INTERVENTIONS ? Patients receive either ( ) Clarithromycin S/R 1g od ( ii ) placebo tablet identical size , colour taste . WHAT IS THE PROPOSED DURATION OF THE TREATMENT PERIOD ? Clarithromycin placebo therapy continue three month . WILL HEALTH SERVICE RESEARCH ISSUES BE ADDRESSED ? Not Applicable WHAT IS THE PROPOSED FREQUENCY/DURATION OF FOLLOW UP ? Patients review one , two four week monthly follow two month treatment . Follow thereafter gastroenterology outpatient clinic . HOW WILL THE OUTCOME MEASURES BE MEASURED AT FOLLOW-UP ? CDAI calculate baseline subsequent follow patient 's symptom scoring diary , haematocrit weight . Similarly van Hees index calculate serum CRP measure . The IBD quality life questionnaire complete baseline 3 month . Patients also diary card record detail symptom note trial ass adverse effect trial treatment . WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR ALLOCATING PATIENTS TO TRIAL GROUPS ? Randomisation allocate pharmacy department hospital . WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED METHODS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST OTHER SOURCES OF BIAS ? Controls ( know Pharmacy Department ) receive placebo tablet identical size colour taste . Patients stratify accord site disease 3 group : colonic CD , perianal disease others ( ileocolonic , small bowel ) . WHAT IS THE PROPOSED SAMPLE SIZE ? 39 patient group ( active treatment placebo ) give 90 % power exclude response 60 % ( p2 ) compare 20 % ( p1 ) placebo p &lt; 0.05 [ 16 ] . The publish placebo response rate active CD 20 % . WHAT IS THE PLANNED RECRUITMENT RATE ? 5 patient per month ARE THERE LIKELY TO BE ANY PROBLEMS WITH COMPLIANCE ? Compliance assess number return tablet assess good ( &lt; 25 % return , fair 25-50 % return poor ( &gt; 50 % return ) . WHAT IS THE LIKELY RATE OF LOSS TO FOLLOW UP ? 100 % follow achievable . HOW MANY CENTRES WILL BE INVOLVED ? One WHAT IS THE PROPOSED TYPE OF ANALYSIS ? For primary outcome measure difference proportion calculate associated 95 % confidence interval . Formal hypothesis test primary outcome compare chi-square test . Quantitative variable compare use repeat measure analysis take account distribution variable [ 17 ] WHAT IS THE PROPOSED FREQUENCY OF ANALYSIS ? Once completion . ARE THERE ANY PLANNED SUBGROUP ANALYSES ? Data patient stratify group examine separately formal statistical analysis subgroup use test interaction ( Altman DG . Practical Statistics Medical Research . Chapman &amp; Hall . London . 1991 ) . We anticipate though , main outcome data present patient together . WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED RESEARCH COST OF THE TRIAL ? To discuss . Part funding require research nurse drug trial pharmacist . IS THERE AN NHS SERVICE SUPPORT COST OF THIS TRIAL , AND IF SO WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED COST ? The NHS cost would modest , involve routine test full blood count CRP current practice monitoring patient relapse inflammatory bowel disease . OVER WHAT PERIOD IS FUNDING REQUESTED ? Funding request 2 year period cover primary trial . References : 1 . Jarnerot G , Sandberg-Gertzen H , Tysk C. Medical therapy active Crohn 's disease . Ball Clin Gastroenterol 1998 ; 12:73-92 . 2 .
