	<brief_title>Impact Zinc Supplementation Mortality Hospitalizations Children Aged 1 Months 23 Months</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Studies develop country show substantial reduction diarrhoea respiratory morbidity young child receive zinc supplementation . The impact daily zinc supplementation coadministered iron folic acid young child cause hospitalisation mortality comparison iron folic acid alone , evaluate help shape public policy . Design : Randomised double blind trial Setting : Low middle socio-economic urban neighbourhood north north-west Delhi India Participants : 94359 subject age 1 month 23 month Interventions : The subject administer dispersible tablet contain one recommend daily allowance zinc iron folic acid iron folic acid alone , daily 12 month enrolment . Main outcome measure : Hospitalisations capture passive surveillance eight hospital train study physician . Deaths ascertain bimonthly visit household . Results : A third total child low zinc level ( &lt; 60 mg/dL ) one fourth iron deficiency ( haematocrit &lt; 33 % ) baseline . The proportion zinc deficient significantly low post 12 month supplementation , zinc iron folic acid group ( difference proportion -10 % ; 95 % confidence interval -15.6 % -4.4 % , p 0.0005 ) . Only 7.7 % zinc iron folic acid 7.3 % iron folic acid group low haematocrit . Zinc iron folic acid supplementation impact hospitalisation , overall cause-specific . The overall death rate similar two group . Conclusions : The lack mortality impact may real finding could result use low daily zinc dose morbidity prevention trial interaction zinc iron whereby add iron , may adversely affected potential effect zinc immune function morbidity . Future research address iron zinc interaction effect important functional outcome .</detailed_description>
