	<brief_summary>The specific aim study test hypothesis light stimulus concentrate around 467 nm evoke significantly strong therapeutic response SAD patient compare light stimulus concentrate around 657 nm equal photon density . The secondary objective study determine efficacy different color level light order optimize therapeutic benefit , also minimize side effect maintain safety light exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Research Study Treatment Winter Depression With Different Colors Light</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies report many 1 every 5 Americans affect mild severe Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD , winter depression ) . Although exact cause condition unknown , bright light proven effective therapeutic treatment many people SAD . The light source traditionally use treatment SAD produce white light great variability balance wavelength emit across visible spectrum . Although several study attempt test effectiveness different wavelength treatment SAD , device use study employ broad bandwidth light . With technological advancement light emit diode ( LEDs ) production new light therapy equipment much narrow bandwidth light possible . Side effect exposure traditional white light therapy SAD include hypomanic activation , irritability , headache , eyestrain nausea . We hypothesize wavelength light therapy optimize , feasible elicit strong therapeutic benefit low light intensity few side effect . Previous study , approve Jefferson IRB successfully complete laboratory show color light effective treat SAD color .</detailed_description>
