	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Epoetin Alfa Versus Placebo Reduce Need Blood Transfusions Reduce Occurrence Severe Anemia During Time Period Surrounding Total Hip Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major surgical procedure may require blood transfusion operation . Agents increase rate red blood cell production would reduce need blood transfusion reduce occurrence anemia . Epoetin alfa genetically engineer form natural hormone , erythropoietin , use treat anemia stimulate red blood cell production . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multicenter study patient schedule total hip replacement surgery . This study ass effectiveness epoetin alfa ( start either 5 10 day hip replacement surgery continue though 3 day surgery ) reduce need blood transfusion occurrence anemia time period surround surgery . Hip replacement either initial implant surgery second surgery hip . Eligible patient assign one three treatment group . Group 1 receive daily placebo injection skin 14 day ; Group 2 receive long ( 14-day ) course daily epoetin alfa injection skin ; Group 3 receive shorter ( 9-day ) course daily epoetin alfa injection skin . Patients Groups 2 3 receive 300 unit epoetin alfa per kilogram body weight per day daily injection . All patient receive oral iron supplementation begin 3 week prior surgery continue 1 week surgery . All patient also receive low-dose coumadin ( sodium warfarin ) 7 day surgery prevent clot deep vein . Effectiveness determine number patient require transfusion number patient develop anemia ( measure hemoglobin level &lt; 80 gram per liter ) . Effectiveness also determine total number transfusion require , change red blood cell variable ( hemoglobin , hematocrit , number develop red blood cell ( reticulocyte ) , change iron store patient 's blood , intensity nursing care require , well-being assessment ( measure pain , shortness breath , energy level ) , number day hospital surgery . Safety evaluation include incidence blood clot deep vein low limb , incidence severity adverse event , change clinical laboratory test result vital sign . The study hypothesis patient treat epoetin alfa , , hip replacement surgery require few blood transfusion reduce occurrence anemia compare patient treat placebo , short course epoetin alfa dosing ( 9 day ) effective long epoetin alfa course ( 14 day ) . 300 unit epoetin alfa per kilogram ( U/kg ) inject skin 5 10 day surgery , day surgery , 3 day surgery ; placebo injection 14 day . Subjects receive epoetin alfa 5 day also receive placebo 5 day start epoetin alfa .</detailed_description>
