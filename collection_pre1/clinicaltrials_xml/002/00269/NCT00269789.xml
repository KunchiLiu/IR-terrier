	<brief_title>A Comparative Effectiveness Study Evaluating OROS Methylphenidate HCl , Ritalin ( Methylphenidate HCl ) , Placebo Treatment Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) represent common neurobehavioral disorder child , affect 3 % 5 % school-age population . This double-blind , double-dummy , randomize , placebo-controlled , active-controlled , crossover trial child ADHD , compare safety effectiveness ( onset effect , time loss effect overall efficacy ) OROS® Methylphenidate HCl standard immediate-release Ritalin® placebo . During study , patient receive three treatment ( OROS® Methylphenidate HCl 18 , 36 54 milligram per day , Ritalin® 5 , 10 15 milligram three time per day , placebo ) 7 day , assign one three dosage level depend upon prestudy methylphenidate dose regimen . The total study participation patient 21 day . Since ADHD manifest variety setting affect attention behavior , study ass efficacy home , community school , laboratory school setting use numerous assessment design evaluate various aspect disorder . These assessment complete variety raters , include parents/caregivers , community school teacher , laboratory school teacher laboratory school counselor . The primary measure effectiveness community school teacher 's rating IOWA Conners Inattention/Overactivity subscale . Additional measure effectiveness include IOWA Conners ( Inattention/Overactivity Oppositional/Defiance subscale ) rating , SKAMP attention deportment rating , peer interaction behavioral rating , global assessment , accuracy productivity independent assign academic seatwork , assessment positive negative social behavior , classroom rule violation disruptive behavior . Safety evaluation include incidence adverse event , vital sign , sleep quality , appetite , presence/severity tic ( hard-to-control , repeat twitch part body hard-to-control repeat sound word ) . Patients give oral dos : OROS® ( methylphenidate HCl ) either 1 , 2 3 18 milligram tablet daily , Ritalin® 5 , 10 , 15 mg ( encapsulated/single capsule ) three time per day , placebo . There three treatment group , group dose 7 day total 21 day study .</detailed_description>
