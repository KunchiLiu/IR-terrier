	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Efficacy Safety OROS® Oxybutynin That Ditropan® ( Immediate-release Oxybutynin ) Treatment Patients With Urge Mixed Urinary Incontinence .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ditropan® indicate treatment urge urinary incontinence , however patient tend discontinue medication decrease dose due anticholinergic side effect . OROS® oxybutynin , continuous release formulation , expect few anticholinergic side effect Ditropan® may provide equal good efficacy compare Ditropan® . This randomized , multi-center , double-blind , parallel group , dose-escalation study compare efficacy safety OROS® oxybutynin Ditropan® treatment urge mixed urinary incontinence minimum effective dose ( MED ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , maximum allowable dose ( MAD ) permit protocol . Patients treatment group begin study drug treatment oxybutynin dose 5 mg per day . The dose change 5 mg increment 4- 7-day interval , depend safety efficacy current dose . The maximum allowable dose Ditropan® 20 mg per day , maximum daily adult dose specify labeling . Because controlled delivery oxybutynin OROS® dosage form could potentially reduce side effect , believe drug could possibly tolerate dos high 20 mg per day . Consequently , maximum allowable dose OROS® oxybutynin 30 mg per day , administer single daily dose . The primary measure effectiveness include change baseline follow assessment : number urge urinary incontinence episode per week , total number urinary incontinence episode , total void frequency ( normal incontinent ) . Safety evaluation include incidence adverse event , physical examination medical history , clinical laboratory test , urinalysis , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , vital sign , Anticholinergic Effects Assessment ( ACEA ) questionnaire . OROS® ( oxybutynin chloride ) 5 mg tablet , one six tablet per day ( 5 mg/day 30 mg/day ) single morning oral dose 11 day 70 day , Ditropan ( oxybutynin chloride ) 5 mg tablet , one four tablet per day orally ( 5 mg per day 5 mg four time per day ) 10 daysup 61 day .</detailed_description>
