	<brief_summary>Angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor show improve survival reduce risk cardiovascular event group patient follow myocardial infarction . This study design test whether early initiation ( ≤7 day ) ACE inhibitor post-coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) , would reduce cardiovascular event . The trial double-blind , placebo control study 2,553 patient randomly assign quinapril , target dose 40 mg daily placebo , follow 43 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The IMAGINE study double-blind , placebo control , parallel group , randomize , multi-centre international study conduct patient undergone CABG . The research protocol approve ethic committee participate institution , patient give write informed consent . The data collect analysed independent clinical research organization . Patients screen eligibility randomize hospital within seven day post-CABG , except France randomization could occur within ten day post-CABG . Starting November 6 , 2001 , give increase evidence benefit ACE inhibitor patient diabetes renal disease,14 patient require insulin type II diabetes micro-albuminuria longer eligible study . Those already trial treat accord clinical judgement treat physician . Of patient screen 57 site Canada , Netherlands , Belgium France , 2 553 patient ( approximately 5 percent patient screen ) randomize post-operatively quinapril either 10 20 mg , placebo . Randomization do centrally , un-stratified , block-based , computer generate . If tolerate , patient up-titrated 40 mg quinapril placebo equivalent within hospital , tolerate , later post-hospital discharge . Patients follow twenty-four month time invite continue 43 month follow-up , withdrawn wish extend participation trial . The original primary endpoint consist time first occurrence composite cardiovascular death resuscitate cardiac arrest , nonfatal myocardial infarction , coronary revascularization , unstable angina require hospitalization document angina require hospitalization . On January 14 , 2003 , Steering Committee conclude require number endpoint would likely reach without modification primary endpoint . Stroke congestive heart failure require hospitalization thus add primary endpoint sample-size increase 2 500 patient . The secondary endpoint include , 1 ) time first occurrence follow composite cardiovascular death resuscitate cardiac arrest , nonfatal myocardial infarction , coronary revascularization stroke ; 2 ) incidence mention secondary endpoint ; 3 ) time first occurrence composite primary endpoint addition follow : transient ischemic attack , cardiovascular event require hospitalization ; 4 ) incidence secondary endpoint include # 3 ; 5 ) time occurrence death cause . All endpoint adjudicate blinded fashion endpoint committee , base pre-defined definition endpoint .</detailed_description>
