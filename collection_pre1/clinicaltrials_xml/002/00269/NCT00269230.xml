	<brief_summary>People abnormal heart beat , whose heart beat , may need electronic device call pacemaker defibrillator . Furthermore , people whose heart reduce pump ability may need device call cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) device . A CRT device implant surgically skin upper chest area . This device help heart beat regular rhythm send electrical signal ( pace ) directly heart tissue flexible wire call lead . The device may also able stop heart beat fast . Three lead implant chamber heart . Two lead place right side heart . The third lead place left side heart lead study . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy Attain StarFixTM Model 4195 Left Ventricular ( LV ) Lead . This particular model lead special characteristic may help good keep position implant left ventricle . It also `` steroid-eluting '' mean time slowly release small amount medication heart tissue help prevent much swell around area implant .</brief_summary>
