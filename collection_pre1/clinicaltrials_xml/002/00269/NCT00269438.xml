	<brief_title>New Tablet Formulation Dosing Regimen Balsalazide Disodium Mildly Moderately Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary efficacy endpoint proportion subject achieve clinical improvement improvement rectal bleed subscale MMDAI end eight week therapy , clinical improvement define great equal 3 point improvement baseline MMDAI . The secondary endpoint follow : 1 . The change baseline duration treatment total MMDAI score individual MMDAI subscales . 2 . The change baseline Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 8 total MMDAI score individual MMDAI subscale ( endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy Weeks 2 8 ) . 3 . The proportion subject treatment failure , define withdrawal due significant disease progression lack significant improvement , determine Investigator . 4 . The proportion subject mucosal heal Weeks 2 8 , mucosal healing define endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy score 0 1 5 . The proportion subject achieve complete remission Week 2 Week 8 , complete remission define MMDAI score less equal 1 . 6 . The proportion subject improvement baseline Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 8 total MMDAI score individual MMDAI subscale ( endoscopy/sigmoidoscopy Weeks 2 8 ) . 7 . Change baseline Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 8 diarrhea , abdominal discomfort , subjective sense well , record subject ' diary . 8 . The proportion subject achieve clinical remission Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 8 , clinical remission define score 0 rectal bleeding combine score less equal 2 bowel frequency physician assessment use MMDAI . 9 . Time clinical remission , clinical remission define secondary endpoint number eight . Safety endpoint follow : - incidence treatment-emergent AEs group body system evaluate treatment group ; - change baseline clinical laboratory parameter treatment visit treatment group ; - change baseline vital sign measurement treatment visit treatment group .</detailed_description>
