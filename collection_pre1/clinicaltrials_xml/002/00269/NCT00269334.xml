	<brief_summary>The study include two components： ( 1 ) cross-sectional ( Study I ) , ( 2 ) longitudinal treatment trial ( Study II ) . The cross-sectional component include subject initially recruit parent project . Genotyping characteristic compare clinical status ( i.e. , recover vs symptomatic ) . The treatment trial component ( one ) include subset subject ( n = 400 ) remain significantly depress . They randomly assign 8-weeks treatment either citalopram paroxetine . With design , wish test follow hypotheses： Ⅰ . Depressed patient short variant serotonin transporter ( 5HTTLPR ) respond faster good antidepressant compare counterpart long variant . Concurrently , patient 5-HTT Stin2 12/12 allele also show good response compare 10/12 allele . Ⅱ . Depressed patient homozygous deficient less active CYP2D6 CYP2C19 enzyme ( ) likely show treatment emergent side effect compare subject wildtype allele . Specifically , Study II , CYP2D6 polymorphism predict PAR CIT side effect CYP2C19 polymorphism associate CIT PAR side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite remarkable progress recent decade modern psychopharmacotherapy , patient vary substantially response antidepressant , range total remission complete treatment failure . Adverse effect , often bothersome occasionally life-threatening , continue represent significant challenge patient clinician . Mechanisms responsible variability remain poorly understood . In addition , although less appreciated , substantial cross-ethnic variation psychotropic response often exist . Recent development field pharmacogenetics indicate genetic factor may account large part difference response . Specific genetic polymorphism affect function serotonin ( SERT ) system postulate predict effect antidepressant . Similarly , genetic mutation show exert predominant influence expression number drug-metabolizing enzyme , include cytochrome P-450 enzyme ( e.g. , CYP2C19 CYP3A4 ) responsible biotransformation antidepressant . Polymorphisms gene control enzymes find strongly associate propensity various kind side effect . Capitalizing new development , propose study examine predictive value genetic polymorphism 400 patient DSM-IV major depression prospectively treat citalopram ( CIT ) . It postulate mutation affect function SERT predict response CIT , polymorphism CYP2C19 associate side effect profile pharmacokinetics CIT . The propose study represent extension replication 5-year NIH/NIMH collaborative project design initiated 2001 PI , currently ongoing three site U.S. ( “ Ethnic Variations Antidepressant Response ” 1 R01 MH62421 ; 1R01MH626761R01MH62531 , 07/01 - 06/06 ) . In original study , inclusion two comparison group , African Americans Caucasians , whose genetic mutation pattern diverge significantly , allow u examine difference affect antidepressant response pattern whether association “ replicable ” across ethnicity . Results pool derived site , represent rare opportunity compare finding across Taiwanese , African American Caucasian subject comparable diagnosis treat identical protocol .</detailed_description>
