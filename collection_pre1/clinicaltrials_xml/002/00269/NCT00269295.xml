	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether new vaccine typhoid fever safe effective . This study also look effect ( good bad ) new vaccine , Ty800 , volunteer . The study determine high dose Ty800 give without cause severe side effect . About 54 healthy male female , age 18-45 inclusive , Cincinnati metropolitan area enrol study . They study approximately 7 month , include one month screen period , study product administration Day 0 , 10-day hospital stay , outpatient period Days 9-28 4 follow-up visit , safety follow-up phone call 2 6 month hospital discharge . Researchers hope trial help produce vaccine combine high level durable protective immunity simplicity administration minimal reaction vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TY800 Dose Escalation ( Typhoid )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Typhoid fever generalize infection reticuloendothelial system ( spleen , liver , bone marrow ) , gut-associated lymphoid tissue gall bladder cause Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( S typhi ) . Humans known natural host reservoir S typhi . Typhoid bacillus transmit fecal-oral route contaminate drinking water food . The ideal typhoid vaccine would combine high level durable protective immunity simplicity administration minimal reactogenicity . The primary objective study assess safety Ty800 oral typhoid vaccine administer single dose range dos ( 5 x 10^7 , 5 x 10^8 , 5 x 10^9 cfu ) healthy adult subject compare placebo . The primary endpoint safety Ty800 dose level administer compare placebo determine absence bacteremia , absence diagnosis typhoid fever confirm positive blood culture Ty800 vaccine organism , verify null phoP/phoQ phenotype retain isolated shed vaccine organism . Safety variable assess report incidence adverse event ( AE ) , blood culture , change vital sign , physical examination , routine laboratory parameter time vaccine dose level compare placebo . The secondary objective study : evaluate immunogenicity single oral dose administration Ty800 range dose healthy adult subject ; evaluate Ty800 vaccine dose response compare immunogenicity profile dose level ; evaluate shed profile Ty800 determine quantity duration shed dose level . The tertiary objective study include : evaluating , substudy , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) candidate gene , e.g. , IL-8 interferon gamma , may influence immune response persistent shed vaccine organism evaluate induction memory B cell vaccinated subject . This study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose escalation , inpatient phase I/II clinical trial . Three dose level Ty800 vaccine evaluate compare placebo . Prior randomization administration study vaccine , subject undergo screen evaluation . Healthy subject meet study eligibility criterion admit inpatient facility appropriate isolation containment day prior randomization , remain unit approximately 10 consecutive day . Three cohort 18 volunteer , represent 3 escalate dos Ty800 typhoid vaccine challenge . In cohort , 12 volunteer receive Ty800 single oral dose , 6 volunteer receive placebo . Dose escalation occur stepwise fashion dependent upon assessment safety parameter meet criterion advancement next dose . Participants involve study related procedure 7 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy men woman , age 18 45 year , inclusive . Provide voluntary write informed consent prior undergo study specific screening procedure . Must willing remain inpatient study unit least 10 day . Subjects must nonchildbearing potential , childbearing potential ( determined investigator ) must use effective license method birth control ( e.g. , oral contraceptive ; diaphragm condom combination contraceptive jelly , cream , foam ; intrauterine contraceptive device ; DepoProvera® ; skin patch ; vaginal ring cervical cap abstinence ) 30 day prior vaccination must agree continue precaution study 30 day final study visit . A highly effective method birth control define one result low failure rate ( i.e. , less 1 percent per year ) use consistently correctly , implant , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUDs ) , sexual abstinence , vasectomized partner . ICH Guidance Industry M3 Nonclinical Safety Studies Conduct Human Clinical Trials Pharmaceuticals ( April 1997 ) . If subject us abstinence method birth control questionnaire use assure abstinence . Have normal screen laboratory SGPT ( ALT ) , creatinine , sodium , potassium , total white blood count ( WBC ) , hemoglobin , neutrophil , lymphocyte , platelet , urine protein hematuria . Positive serum pregnancy test screen admission ( Day 1 ) . Women pregnant lactate woman childbearing potential agree use acceptable birth control method . History immunocompromised state , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome , autoimmune disease , leukemia , lymphoma , generalized malignancy , undergo longterm chemotherapy , radiation therapy , receive systemic steroid therapy . A history basal cell squamous cell carcinoma cure local excision 5 year ago consider exclusion criterion . Clinically significant history cardiovascular disease , respiratory disease , gall bladder disease , endocrine disorder , liver disease , renal disease , gastrointestinal disease , sickle cell anemia , neurologic illness , psychiatric disorder require chronic medication prior hospitalization . Presence prosthetic cardiac valve intravascular intraarticular prosthetic material . Presence HIV antibody . Presence hepatitis B surface antigen hepatitis C antibody . HLAB27 IgA deficiency . Presence Salmonella specie and/or bacterial parasitic pathogen screen stool examination . History travel S typhi endemic area within last 5 year , history raise child S typhi endemic area , vaccination typhoid fever , infection S typhi , participation typhoid fever clinical trial use S typhi S typhi vector time . United States , Canada , Europe , New Zealand Australia consider endemic area . Clinically abnormal screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) define pathologic Q wave significant STT wave change ; criterion leave ventricular hypertrophy ; nonsinus rhythm exclude isolated premature atrial contraction . Known allergy sensitivity 2 follow antibiotic : ciprofloxacin , amoxicillin , trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole , chloramphenicol , ceftriaxone , quinolones ( e.g. , enoxacin , lomefloxacin , ofloxacin , norfloxacin ) . Known allergy component Ty800 vaccine buffer ( sodium bicarbonate/ascorbic acid ) . Receipt blood/blood product immunoglobulins within 6 month prior screen visit . Donation blood within 2 month . A change subject 's normal stool pattern within 3 month prior screen visit . A normal stool pattern define least week less 4 time day . Regular ( monthly often ) use laxatives include herbal laxative . Any medical illness require new prescription medication hospitalization 45day screening period prior admission inpatient facility temperature great equal 38.0ºC inpatient period prior administer study vaccine . Use antibiotic within 7 day prior study product administration . Use H2 receptor antagonist ( e.g. , Tagamet® , Zantac® , Pepcid® ) , proton pump inhibitor ( e.g. , Prilosec® OTC , Protonix® , Prevacid® ) , prescription acid suppression medication overthecounter ( OTC ) antacid within 72 hour study product administration . Subjects commercial food handler , day care worker , health care worker involve direct patient contact . Subjects young child ( &lt; 2 year ) home household contact immunocompromised , pregnant , breastfeed . Participation investigational drug , device , vaccine trial within 30 day prior screen plan participation within 30 day final study visit . Subjects unable pas write test describe typhoid fever explain requirement clinical trial . Any condition responsibility , medical , psychiatric , social condition occupational responsibility , judgment investigator , would interfere serve contradiction subject 's participation protocol assessment investigational product .
