	<brief_summary>The purpose study provide data effectiveness OROS Methylphenidate Hydrochloride ( HCl ) formulation compare placebo standard immediate-release Ritalin respect improve attention behavior , decrease hyperactivity child Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . Both OROS Methylphenidate HCl Ritalin contain central nervous system stimulant , methylphenidate HCl . The safety associate two methylphenidate formulation also compare placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Effectiveness Safety Study Evaluating OROS Methylphenidate Hydrochloride ( HCl ) , Ritalin ( Methylphenidate HCl ) Placebo Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) represent common neurobehavioral disorder child , affect 3 % 5 % school-age population . Behavioral pediatrician , child psychiatrist , child neurologist indicate referral ADHD may constitute 50 % practice . This double-blind , double-dummy , randomize , placebo-controlled , active-controlled , 3-treatment , 3-period crossover trial compare safety effectiveness ( onset effect , time loss effect overall efficacy ) OROS Methylphenidate Hydrochloride ( HCl ) , standard immediate-release Ritalin placebo . During study , patient receive three treatment ( OROS Methylphenidate HCl 18 , 36 54 milligram per day , Ritalin 5 , 10 15 milligram three time per day , placebo ) 7 day , assign one three dosage level depend upon prestudy methylphenidate dose regimen . The total study participation patient 21 day . Since ADHD manifest variety setting affect attention behavior , study ass efficacy home , community school , laboratory school setting use numerous assessment design evaluate various aspect disorder . These assessment complete variety raters , include parents/caregivers , community school teacher , laboratory school teacher . The primary measure effectiveness community school teacher 's rating IOWA Conners Inattention/Overactivity subscale . Additional measure effectiveness include IOWA Conners ( Inattention/Overactivity Oppositional/Defiance subscale ) rating , SKAMP attention deportment rating , peer interaction behavioral rating , global assessment , SNAP-IV rating , activity level structure activity , accuracy productivity independent assign academic seatwork , home situation questionnaire . Safety evaluation include incidence adverse event , physical examination , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , sleep quality , actigraphy ( sleep latency , duration , arousal ) , appetite , presence/severity tic ( hard-to-control , repeat twitch part body hard-to-control repeat sound word ) . Patients give oral dos : OROS ( methylphenidate HCl ) 1 , 2 , 3 18-milligram tablet daily , Ritalin 5 , 10 , 15 mg ( encapsulated/single capsule ) three time day , placebo . There three treatment group , group dose 7 day total 21 day study .</detailed_description>
