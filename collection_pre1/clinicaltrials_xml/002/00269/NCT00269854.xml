	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Anti-TNF Monoclonal Antibody Patients With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , dose-ranging study follow placebo-controlled , double-blind , repeated-dose extension evaluate effectiveness safety anti-TNF chimeric monoclonal antibody ( cA2 ) compare placebo treatment patient active Crohn 's disease . The primary efficacy outcome study comparison proportion patient achieve clinical response 4-week evaluation . Clinical response define reduction baseline Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) score least 70 point . Additional measurement effectiveness include clinical response time , time loss response , clinical remission time , change Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) , Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( IBDQ ) , Crohn 's Disease Endoscopic Index Severity ( CDEIS ) score C-reactive protein value .
