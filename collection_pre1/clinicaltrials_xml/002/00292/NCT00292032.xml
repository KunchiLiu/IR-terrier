	<detailed_description>Arrhythmias cause congenital acquired abnormality cardiac K+ Na+ channel increasingly recognize cause syncope sudden death . Cardiac arrest absence overt structural heart disease previously consider idiopathic ventricular fibrillation ( IVF ) . The list cause `` unexplained '' cardiac arrest ( UCA ) encompass K+ related abnormality ( Long Short QT , Andersen 's ) , Na+ relate ( Long QT3 , Brugada ) , Ca++ relate ( Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia-CPVT ) , latent cardiomyopathy . These underlying cause cardiac arrest overtly familial 30-60 % case . Clinical detection underlie phenotype crucial direct appropriate treatment , genetic test screen family member . Phenotype recognition range rare genetic condition include non-invasive invasive test demonstrate hallmark individual condition , exclude common cause ischemic idiopathic form cardiomyopathy . The outcome type test assess systematic fashion patient UCA family member . Phenotype-genotype correlation necessary develop optimal diagnostic test probands screen technique family member , result disease-specific therapy . Genetic test patient overt phenotype demonstrate potentially causative mutation 50-75 % LQTS patient , 20 % Brugada 's Syndrome patient . Despite recognize mutation phenotypic expression model , 30-80 % patient negative gene screen despite overt latent clinical disease . The propose project evaluate systematic approach clinical assessment genetic screening patient family UCA suspect inherited arrhythmia involve : 1 . A multicenter registry UCA patient , family member refer patient familial sudden death undergo standardized test evidence primary electrical disease ( PED ) . The single center pilot experience applicant 's institution proven feasibility , accept publication Circulation , indicate novelty . Ten center across Canada agree participate . The target enroll 1500 UCA probands , 1st degree family member . 1st degree relative autopsy negative unexplained sudden death victim . 2 . Long term cardiac monitoring ( 3 year ) select high-risk patient injectable cardiac monitor detect potential substrate and/ore trigger sudden death . 3 . DNA/plasma collection biobanking stratified whole exome sequencing .</detailed_description>
