	<brief_title>A Randomised , Double-blind , Crossover Study Ba679BR Respimat Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 16-week , multi-centre , randomised , double-blind , double-dummy , crossover study 4-week randomise treatment period demonstrate efficacy safety 5 ug Ba 679 BR inhalation solution Respimat compare tiotropium inhalation powder capsule ( 18 ug ) via HandiHaler patient COPD . The two 4-week randomise treatment period separate 4-week washout period . Study Hypothesis : The primary aim trial demonstrate non-inferiority lung function response 5 ug ( 2 actuation 2.5 ug ) Ba679BR Respimat deliver Respimat inhaler daily compare tiotropium ( 18 ug ) inhale powder capsule HandiHaler daily end 4-week treatment period patient COPD . The hypothesis test non-inferiority perform alpha = 0.025 ( one-sided ) . Comparison ( ) : The primary efficacy endpoint trough FEV1 response determine end 4-week period randomise treatment .</detailed_description>
