	<detailed_description>Fecal incontinence ( FI ) devastate condition cause psychological stress , shame , embarrassment , social isolation . It major impact quality life patient family . It complicate medical illness management , major economic consequence contribute early nursing home placement . Although FI affect 2.2 % 11 % general population , magnitude problem underestimate , since patient discuss silent affliction care provider . In uncontrolled study biofeedback FI , include preliminary observation male veteran without anal sphincter injury , improvement observe 80 % patient . However , may appropriate patient . One recent randomize , control trial predominantly ( 93 % woman ) female patient , many ( &gt; 60 % ) post-obstetrical anal sphincter injury , report biofeedback effective medical therapy alone . The trial provide data formulation evidence-based approach treat FI female veteran . There randomize , control data effectiveness biofeedback FI male patient . A randomized , control trial need assess effectiveness multi-component biofeedback therapy versus standard medical therapy man . The immediate objective current proposal evaluate effectiveness biofeedback treatment FI identify baseline patient characteristic predict improvement adequate relief FI symptoms follow treatment . This lead directly long-term goal provide optimal treatment FI tailor biofeedback plus medical therapy patient 's need , base sound clinical evidence . This project prospective , randomize , control clinical trial compare two treatment FI among patient fail medical treatment care primary care provider refer evaluation management current FI . As part standard care , refer patient receive history physical examination , include medical , surgical , FI-specific symptom physical finding ( general , mobility , mental status anorectal examination ) . Those meet inclusion criterion agree participate randomly assign one 2 study arm : 1. medical therapy alone , 2. medical therapy + sphincter strength + sensation + coordination training . Baseline data also include adequate relief measure , incontinence score base bowel habit diary , anorectal parameter base manometric sensory testing , general FI-specific quality life , depression , anxiety , expectation improvement follow treatment . All questionnaire base publish , validated instrument . Patients treat six biweekly session ( 3 month ) . Medical therapy ( six 40 - 60 minute session ) include advice , medication constipation/diarrhea , instruction relate empiric anal sphincter exercise ( group 1 ) . Biofeedback treatment ( six 40 - 60 minute session ) include medical therapy plus component biofeedback ( group 2 ) . Follow data obtain patient end treatment ( 3 month ) mail questionnaire 12 month completion treatment dropout . We determine biofeedback plus medical therapy superior medical therapy alone provide FI symptom relief . The possibility patient report relief FI symptom specific deficit ( ) detect baseline test show ( ) improvement treatment . The influence co-variables result treatment also determine . Our long term goal develop clinically relevant strategy cost-effect management FI VA patient ( predominantly male ) within organizational frame work primary subspecialty care . If biofeedback treatment proven effective , VA patient offer therapy component optimal likelihood success , obvious benefit VA patient abatement silent affliction FI improvement patient satisfaction quality life . Further study focus multi-site cooperative study assess component biofeedback instrumental bringing improvement relief patient specific deficit .</detailed_description>
