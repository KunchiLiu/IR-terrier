	<brief_summary>Background : - The treatment addiction often hinge prevent relapse drug-using behavior , occur high rate even prolong abstinence . Some methadone patient continue abuse cocaine heroin treatment , even extensive psychosocial service . More research need look result earlier study continue drug use methadone treatment , focus result fix vs. flexible dos methadone reduce likelihood continue drug use role monetary voucher incentive continue abstinence illicit substance . Objectives : - To determine combination flexible methadone dose voucher-based contingency management improve rate abstinence heroin cocaine . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age old dependent opioids ( cocaine and/or heroin ) . Design : - The study last 40 week . After initial screening , participant receive daily methadone weekly drug counseling session continue throughout study . - After 6 week methadone treatment , participant continue use heroin cocaine randomize one four group 16 week study . Each group receive flexible fix dose methadone , one two contingency management condition . - Flexible-dose participant receive individualize dose increase , base drug use withdrawal . Fixed-dose participant set specific dose methadone change . - The two contingency management condition monetary voucher give regular cocaine-negative urine sample , voucher independent urine cocaine screen result . - After study phase , participant 10 week standard individual counseling stable dose methadone . Urine sample continue collect , voucher give . - At end study , participant choice transfer community clinic undergoing 10-week taper methadone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Scientific goal . The primary goal determine simultaneous abstinence heroin cocaine elicit combine two approach : flexible methadone dose voucher-based CM . Secondary goal include : 1 ) compare saliva plasma level methadone , cortisol , prolactin predictor treatment outcome ; 2 ) evaluate impact methadone maintenance renal function , lipid profile , cardiac function . Methods . During initial 6-week baseline phase , cocaine-abusing opioid-dependent outpatient participant ( 300 enrol ; 180 evaluable ) stabilize methadone 70 mg/day . At end baseline , participant continue use heroin cocaine randomize one two dose regimen one two CM condition . In flexible-dose regimen , participant receive individualize dose increase ( 15 mg/day ) maximum 190 mg /day , base heroin use withdrawal . In fixed-dose regimen , participant methadone dose increase 100 mg/day remain fix . Dose-group assignment double-blind : investigator determine participant individualize dose increase , pharmacist know participant actually receive . The two CM condition : voucher contingent cocaine-negative urine specimen , noncontingent voucher ( i.e. , voucher independent urine cocaine screen result ) . The main outcome measure percentage urine simultaneously negative cocaine illicit opiates treatment . For concurrently run pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic portion , saliva blood sample take regular interval determine level methadone , cortisol , prolactin predictor treatment outcome . For concurrently run medical-outcomes portion , urine ( renal function ) , blood ( lipid profile ) , ECGs ( cardiac function ) , obtain set interval . Hypothesis . Flexible methadone dose voucher-based CM safe result great simultaneous abstinence heroin cocaine , high treatment retention , high health-related QOL compare fix methadone dose absence CM . Benefits . Participants receive methadone , counseling , medical care charge . The methadone voucher intervention likely reduce participant ' use heroin cocaine . Counseling include management HIV risk behavior . The study incorporate participant safety monitor provide information relevant improve health safety community methadone-maintenance patient . The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic part study benefit participant directly , may lead development useful less invasive drug-monitoring method . Risks . Participants may experience side effect methadone , discomfort methadone withdrawal , discomfort ( , rarely syncope ) blood draw .</detailed_description>
