	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Nasal NK/T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Histologically proven extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma , nasal type accord WHO classification ( must pathology-proven EBV DNA positive well cytoplasmic CD3 + , CD56+ essential diagnostic criterion . ) . Both newly diagnose patient previous chemotherapy-treated patient residual recurrent disease allow . 2 . Any lymphomatous involvement exist nasal cavity and/or paranasal sinus , orbit , Waldeyer 's ring , oral cavity PS ECOG scale 0-2 . 3 . Stage I contiguous stage II , measurable evaluable lymphoma clinical imaging No previous chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . 4 . ANC ≧ 2,000/mm3 , Platelet ≧ 100,000/mm3 peripheral blood . 5 . Age &lt; 70 . 6 . Total bilirubin ＜ 2.5 mg/dl Serum creatinine ≦1.5 mg/dl Blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) ≦ 25 mg/dl 7 . Signed informed consent Exclusion criterion : 1 . Pregnancy lactation period 2 . Severe intercurrent illness , e.g . infection , heart failure 3 . Myocardial infarction within recent 12 month 4 . Known hypersensitivity component drug treatment regimen TREATMENT PLAN Concurrent chemoradiation primary treatment . The treatment start within 2 week registration . The patient intend receive complete radiation dose ( 50 Gy ) 2 course DEP regimen concurrently . The first course DEP regimen must start within one week initiation radiation ( 1st week ) . The second course DEP regimen give 4 week ( i.e . 5th week ) completion first course DEP period radiotherapy . The first evaluation response CT MRI perform 4 week completion second course DEP ( i.e . 9th week ) . If patient respond therapy remain SD situation , DVIP regimen follow immediately every 4 week another 2 course consolidation therapy . If patient progressive , study treatment stop patient off-studied . And proceed salvage therapy DHAP regimen ethical reason . The second evaluation response perform 4 week completion treatment ( i.e . 21st week ) . 1 . Systemic chemotherapy DEP DVIP regimens Schedule Dose DEP ( q4w , CCRT ) Dexamethosone 20 mg/m2/d i.v . Day 1-3 VP-16 75 mg/m2/d i.v . 1h Day 1-3 cisplatin 75 mg/m2/d i.v . 4h Day 1 1.1 Courses repeat every 28 day total 2 course . 1.2 The first second course perform concurrently radiotherapy . 1.3 The first course DEP regimen must start within one week initiation radiation ( 1st week ) . 1.4 The H3-antagonist permitted anti-emetic use . 1.5 G-CSF allow use prophylactically old ( &gt; 60 year old ) patient patient previous ongoing prolonged myelosuppression . Schedule Dose DVIP ( q4w , post R/T ) Dexamethosone 20 mg/m2/d i.v . Day 1-4 VP-16 75 mg/m2/d i.v . 1h Day 1-4 ifosfamide 1.2 mg/m2/d i.v . 2h Day 1-4 mesna 240 mg/m2/d i.v . 0,4,8 hr Day 1-4 cisplatin 20 mg/m2/d i.v . 1h Day 1-4 1.6 Courses repeat every 28 day total 2 course . 1.7 The first course perform 9th week first evaluation response CT MRI . 1.8 The H3-antagonist permitted anti-emetic use . 1.9 G-CSF allow use prophylactically old ( &gt; 60 year old ) patient patient previous ongoing prolonged myelosuppression . 2 . Involved field radiotherapy Guidelines- 2.1 General Guidelines Local radiation give concurrently chemotherapy begin treatment . Radiation give involved field . 1 . Equipment- Only megavoltage equipment source skin distance 80 cm , great use SAD technique . The treatment give via electron beam alone even lesion superficial . 2 . Cessation RT- condition 1 . Grade 4 mucositis progression . 2 . Grade 4 dermatitis RT field progression 3 . WBC less 2000/mm3 4 . Infection , potentially life threaten . 3 . Re-start RT If toxicity subsides infection control . 2.2 Target Volume Gross Tumor Volume ( GTV ) : The GTV define volume tumor presentation define CT , MRI . Uninvolved drain region cover . The treatment give via electron beam alone even lesion superficial . In case discrepancy scan , large volume irradiate . Clinical Target Volume ( CTV ) : This define GTV 1.5cm margin . Include ethmoid sinus medial half maxillary sinus CTV gross tumor locate within nasal cavity . If ethmoid sinus extensively involved clinical radiographic evidence orbital involvement , medial bony boundary orbit usually irradiate possible microscopic disease extension . Planning Target Volume ( PTV ) : For purpose study , margin set error patient movement add CTV . This may vary must least 0.5cm . CRITERIA FOR WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY All patient still complete protocol treatment continuously followed-up study end point . Patients remove study complete protocol major violation . 1 . Completion assign therapy observation . 2 . Disease progression . 3 . Excessive complication toxicity . 4 . Patient death . 5 . Patient withdrawal refusal . 6 . Serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dl 7 . Any ≧ grade III toxicity persist ≧ 3 wks due day</detailed_description>
