	<detailed_description>Over past decade , many new program intend motivate adolescent decrease substance use develop evaluate . There recent shift towards brief intervention youth school ( Brown , 2001 ; D'Amico Fromme , 2002 ) health care setting , emergency room inpatient clinic ( Barnett et al. , 2001 ; Colby et al. , 1998 ; Monti et al. , 1999 ) . Many youth use drug alcohol risk consequence ( Johnston et al. , 2003 ) . The primary care set present unique opportunity intervene substance abuse adolescent 70 % youth age 10-18 visit physician approximately 3 time year ( Gans Newacheck , 1991 ; Monheit Cunningham , 1992 ) . However , many youth screen use setting ( Friedman et al. , 1990 ; Johnson Millstein , 2003 ; Middleman et al. , 1995 ) preventive service significantly recommend level ( Halpern-Felsher et al. , 2000 ; Klein et al. , 2001 ; Ozer et al. , 2001 ) . This may due clinician time constraint insufficient train substance abuse , adolescent fear parent may see record , clinician discomfort ask question substance use ( Blum , 1987 ; Blum et al. , 1996 ; Lustig et al. , 2001 ; Marcell et al. , 2002 ; Middleman et al. , 1995 ) . The present proposal design meet objective Exploratory/Developmental Grants program ( R21 ) study contribute development future , intensive large research program . The objective propose research : 1 ) explore feasibility adapt brief intervention previous work school emergency room use primary care setting , 2 ) ass short-term efficacy intervention primary care set . This project serve first step innovative line research design examine viability utilize brief intervention target adolescent drug use primary care setting . Our objective accomplish follow aim : 1 . Explore feasibility adapt brief intervention high-risk youth primary care ( PC ) setting . We determine barrier facilitative factor associate implement brief intervention PC set focus group high-risk youth ( n=16 ) , parent ( n=8 ) , clinician ( n=8 ) . Intervention content establish modification previous brief intervention work school hospital setting focus group feedback adolescent , clinician , parent . We anticipate intervention take 15 minute implement clinician ( e.g. , nurse ) PC set . The intervention emphasize motivational technique address variety substance , include marijuana , inhalant , alcohol , cigarette . We pilot test intervention small sample high-risk youth ( n=10 ) obtain feedback discern whether intervention difficult implement ( e.g. , time constraint , comfort level ) youth felt receive feedback clinician substance use ( e.g. , helpful ? What topic would like discuss ? ) . We modify content base feedback . 2 . Implement assess short-term efficacy brief intervention high-risk youth PC set . We implement intervention PC set small sample high-risk youth ( n=30 ) assess potential impact short-term outcome ( e.g. , perceive prevalence peer use , self-change effort ) 3-month follow . These youth compare assessment control group ( n=30 ) . This research culminate development longer-term plan implement evaluate intervention intensively large sample . Products include : 1 ) intervention material adapt use high-risk youth primary care setting , 2 ) pilot data intervention feasibility implementation , 3 ) R01 application examine generalizability long-term impact intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1218 year old english speaker screen positive alcohol and/or drug use We use brief screener identify youth highrisk drug alcohol abuse . The CRAFFT develop Knight colleague screen youth alcohol drug use mnemonic base six question asks . The CRAFFT comprise item RAFFT ( Riggs Alario , 1989 ) , DAP ( Drug Alcohol Problems ) ( Klitzner et al. , 1987 ) POSIT ( Problem Oriented Screening Instrument Teenagers ) ( Rahdert , 1991 ) . The CRAFFT brief , highly correlate Personal Involvement Chemicals Scale ( PICS ) , criterion standard ( r = .84 ) , practical use primary care set take minute administer ( Knight et al. , 1999 ) . The measure include follow Yes/No question : 1 ) ever ridden car drive someone ( include ) high use alcohol drug ? , 2 ) ever use alcohol drug relax , feel well , fit ? , 3 ) ever use alcohol drug ( alone ) ? , 4 ) ever forget thing use alcohol drug ? , 5 ) ever get trouble use alcohol drug ? , 6 ) family friends ever tell cut drink drug use ? . The six item cutoff score 2 great sensitivity 92.3 % specificity 82.5 % longterm treatment need ( identified PICS score ) ( Knight et al. , 1999 ) . We use cutoff 1 great , reflect less stringent criterion `` highrisk '' include adolescent potential problem could benefit brief intervention primary care set . spanish speaker outside age range qualify screen questionnaire use alcohol and/or drug</criteria>
