	<brief_summary>Background : - The treatment addiction often hinge prevent relapse drug-using behavior , occur high rate even prolong abstinence . Research show constant reporting personal data-collection device , electronic diary , help prevent relapse reinforce abstinence . This constant reporting know Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) . - The researcher NIDA already complete two major arm study , focus pattern crave drug use methadone maintenance , whether electronic diary could help remind outpatient complete treatment task . An ongoing arm study examine connection among drug craving/use , stress , geographical location . Objective : - To investigate role stress associate geographical location drug craving use . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age old dependent opioids ( cocaine and/or heroin ) . Design : - The study last 28 week . After initial screening , participant receive daily methadone weekly drug counseling session continue throughout study . - After 3 week methadone treatment , participant 15 week EMA record event-triggered craving daily response ( 3 per day ) . EMA consist event-triggered recording ( initiated participant whenever use heroin cocaine , whenever feel urge ) random-signal-triggered recording ( 3 per day ) . During EMA , participant begin voucher-based program encourage abstinence heroin cocaine . - Participants also carry global positioning system ( GPS ) unit record locations 15 week , complete questionnaire stress level specific interval study . - At end study , participant choice transfer community clinic undergoing 8-week taper methadone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real Time Assessment Drug Craving , Use , Abstinence During Outpatient : A Development Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . We already complete original , major arm protocol ( natural-history study crave lapse ) . Still open enrollment second minor arm ( within-subject trial PDA-based treatment-task reminder ) . In third arm enhance assessment mood , stress , geographical location study crave lapse . All arm study develop either two aspect original arm : ( 1 ) Our grow appreciation technical possibility electronic data collection participant daily environment , ( 2 ) grow interest participant provide descriptive data day-to-day experience addiction recovery . The major complete arm protocol provide wealth descriptive data drug crave lapse via Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) , participant carry handheld data-collection device ( electronic diary , EDs ) report , real time , activity mood . Beyond data monitoring , EDs use complement behavioral intervention . The data-collection device additionally program prompt completion therapist-assigned homework exercise ; extend support outside therapy session , clinical outcome may improve . Furthermore , evidence association completion homework exercise therapeutic outcome . Adapting exist homework assignment make engaging may increase homework completion , turn , general compliance therapy ( Arm 2 ) . The rationale third arm study broaden perspective examination natural history drug craving lapse refine assessment geographical location stressor associate . In , intend investigate determinant addiction reducible individual-level trait instead reflective broad socioeconomic problem manifest difference among neighborhood . Scientific goal . Arm 1 ) To investigate relationship putative trigger drug crave lapse ; Arm 2 ) To investigate interactive effect electronic-diary reminder , simplify therapy-assigned homework task , homework completion therapeutic outcome ; Arm 3 ) Using refinement assessment method , investigate role stress associate geographical location drug craving use . Participant population . Arm 2 : 35 cocaine-abusing opioid-dependent outpatient . Arm 3 : 50 cocaine-abusing opioid-dependent outpatient ( separate Arm 2 ) . Target enrollment arm include 40 % woman 60 % minority ( mostly African-American ) . &lt; TAB &gt; Experimental design method . After 3 week stabilization daily methadone , outpatient undergo 25 week EMA . EMA consist event-triggered recording ( initiated participant whenever use heroin cocaine , whenever feel urge ) random-signal-triggered recording ( 3 per day ) . Target quit date heroin cocaine occur , respectively , first third week EMA . Two day cocaine quit date , participant begin 12 week intensive voucher-based contingency management reinforce abstinence heroin cocaine . Arm 2 : During 12 week , within-subjects manipulation occur : participant receive simplify version current counselor-assigned homework task , participant receive daily reminder via PDA complete homework task ( whether standard simplify version ) . The simplified homework task reminder give two separate , counterbalance , three-week block . Arm 3 : Starting week 4 continue week 18 participant answer enhance EMA question regard stress , mood , location , drug craving use . Additionally , participant Arm 3 carry GPS unit record locations 15 week . GPS location examine drug use , crave self-reported mood . They also complete retrospective stress questionnaire week 3 4-week interval throughout completion study : week 7 , 11 , 15 , 19 , 23 , 27 . After 12-week homework ( Arm 2 ) enhance EMA phase ( Arm 3 ) end , participant choice transfer community clinic undergoing eight-week taper methadone . For participant Arm 2 choose detox Archway , EMA may continue . However , participant Arm 3 , EMA GPS data collect pre-detox detox phase ( week 19-28 ) . &lt; TAB &gt; Benefits participant and/or society . Direct benefit participant include psychological pharmacologic assistance decrease illicit drug use . The methadone administer study decrease participant intravenous opiate use . The contingency management psychotherapy procedure may reduce drug use HIV risk behavior . The decrease HIV risk behavior result low incidence HIV disease . Benefits society include increase scientific understanding precipitant process craving , lapse , relapse , improvement ability assess clinical effectiveness relapse-prevention medication future clinical trial . &lt; TAB &gt; Risks participant . Participants methadone may experience side effect sedation , constipation , mild euphoria . The risk overmedication reduce gradually increase dose methadone first week . The methadone dose use Arm 2 protocol , 100 mg , within limit allow FDA guideline within dose range use methadone clinic Baltimore . For Arm 3 protocol , ceiling methadone dose . Methadone dose adjust MRP clinically indicate base participant feedback , withdrawal signs/symptoms , report craving , urine toxicology result . If patient show sign intoxication , MRP reduce methadone dose evidence intoxication subside . Methadone discontinue participant experience severe side effect . Participants withdraw methadone experience opiate withdrawal symptom , symptom minimize long detox period 8 12 week . Other risk inconvenience carry use EDs , possible embarrassment provide urine sample observation , concern collection GPS data .</detailed_description>
