	<brief_title>Immunization With NY-ESO-1 Protein Combined With CpG 7909 Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , fixed-dose study immunization NY-ESO-1 protein combine CpG 7909 adjuvant patient histopathologically confirm metastatic cancer prostate , progressive disease hormonal and/or chemotherapeutic treatment ( duration treatment &gt; 3 month ) . Eligible patient receive vaccination consist 100µg NY-ESO-1 protein combine 2.5 mg CpG 7909 administer intradermally every 3 week 4 dos . Twelve ( 12 ) patient enrol study . Blood sample obtain baseline , prior second , third fourth injection three week fourth injection clinical hematology , biochemistry immune response assessment . Blood sample antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) anti-dsDNA collect baseline end study cycle . A tumor sample , resect prior immunization , test determine NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 expression . DTH test perform NY-ESO-1b HLA-A2+ patient NY-ESO-1 DP4 HLA-DP4+ patient baseline 3-week visit follow second fourth vaccination . NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 specific antibody assess patient Western Blot ELISA . NY-ESO-1 specific CD4+ CD8+ T cell assess ELISPOT analysis patient . Disease status assess baseline 3 week fourth vaccination patient measurable disease . Patients demonstrate stable disease , minor response , partial response , complete response week 13 may continue receive vaccination disease progression . In patient mixed response , single progressive lesion may resect vaccination may continue . Resected metastasis type NY-ESO- and/or LAGE-1 expression .</detailed_description>
