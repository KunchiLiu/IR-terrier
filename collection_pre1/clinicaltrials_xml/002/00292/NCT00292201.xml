This study test hypothesize statin decrease bronchial hyperresponsiveness inflammation , lead improve symptoms patient asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Statin Treatment Patients With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma affect 7 - 12 % population North America result substantial morbidity health care cost . Management asthma focus towards reduce airway inflammation combination avoidance incite trigger pro-inflammatory agent well anti-inflammatory medication . Corticosteroids anti-leukotrienes efficacious , neither universally effective free side effect . Statins , currently widely prescribe use safely improve serum lipid cholesterol , anti-inflammatory property may clinically useful asthma either addition perhaps instead corticosteroid . The objective research proposal conduct randomize placebo control trial 4 week statin therapy patient moderate severe stable asthma . We hypothesize statin may directly reduce airway inflammation and/or contribute anti-inflammatory effect corticosteroid treatment patient . We measure effect statin measure airway sensitivity methacholine , pulmonary function , sputum eosinophil , quality life subject asthma 4 week treatment . Statins may become alternative treatment option act steroid spar agent patient asthma .</detailed_description>
