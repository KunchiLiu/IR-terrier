	<brief_summary>Background : Studies note correlation food sensitivity health disorder . Various commonly see health problem may cause cane sugar since lavishly frequently use people worldwide . Objective : This study evaluate efficacy NAET test instrument detect hypersensitivity cane sugar . Materials Methods : Seventy-four subject volunteer study . They ask write one major health problem , amount sugar consume daily basis know health problem ( ) relate sugar consumption . The following testing modality use study : ( 1 ) . Allergy Symptom-Rating Scale ( ASRS ) ; ( 2 ) . NST Rating Scale ( NSTRS ) ; ( 3 ) . Pulse Difference Rating Scale ( PDRS ) . Test-1 do twice . Tests 2 3 do three time : without contact sugar contact sugar one minute ten minute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NAET速 Testing Devices Detection Hypersensitivity Cane Sugar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NAET速 test device able detect various level sensitivity food substance people ( JNECM Vol . 1 , No.1 &amp; 2 , 2005 ) manifest symptom . Using NAET test device various level sensitivity sugar easily detect people find sensitive sugar advise take strict preventive measure thus help alleviate health problem . Primary Objective Study The study evaluate efficacy NAET速 test device detect sensitivity cane sugar ( intolerance , hypersensitivity , allergy ) group subject sexes prior knowledge health problem relate sugar consumption . Sample Characteristics Eighty subject group medical professional sex come attend medical conference volunteer participate study . These volunteer come different part Japan thus represent large part country . Nine NAET速 practitioner volunteer supervise entire study . An on-site invitation participate study give group 80 medical professional come attend medical conference Tokyo , Japan . The invitation take part study give member morning time registration conference . The 80 subject respond invitation ask complete Allergy Symptom Rating Scale . They ask list approximate amount daily sugar consumption number teaspoon . They also ask record suffer know sugar-related problem past . The five volunteer-subjects know diabetes hypoglycemia exclude study . All 75 subject complete Allergy Symptom Rating Scale form ( ASRS ) initially prior enter study . After enrol study , examiner perform Neuromuscular sensitivity testing ( NST Rating Scale ) subject touching test sample record result . Initial radial pulse take record . ( Detailed information Allergy Symptom-Rating scale ( ASRS ) ; NSTRS , PDRS : Subject ask mark rate symptom word zero ten scale zero=normal ; ten=maximum discomfort ) : 0= allergy ; ( 1-3 ) =1=mild ; ( 4-6 ) = 2=moderate ; ( 7-10 ) =3=severe . After initial testing ( complete ASRS form , NSTRS balance body , initial pulse reading ) one subject give test tube clear liquid ( dissolved sugar ) hand . The examiner test NST subject hold sample-test tube hand result record . The radial pulse also check record . Then ask continue hold sample full ten minute . At end ten minute , assign test NST Pulse different examiner . While still hold test tube hand , radial pulse test record ; NST perfomed record one ask complete another Allergy Symptom Rating Scale . After complete initial test , monitor move subject one time different area one ask continue hold sample-tubes hand follow ten minute . At end ten minute ' wait period test tube hand , subject give another ASRS form record symptoms one time . They also instruct rate symptom zero ten scale . Then monitor usher different examiner check NST radial pulse one time , still hold test tube hand . The result record separate paper monitor collect result send analysis .</detailed_description>
