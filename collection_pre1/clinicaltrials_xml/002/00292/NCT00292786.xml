	<brief_summary>This proposal design achieve follow specific aim test associate hypothesis : AIM 1 : To compare walk ability , stand posture , gait initiation functional standing step twenty child typical development twenty child spastic diplegia hemiplegia , CP . Hypotheses - Children CP demonstrate impair coordination compare child typical development . In addition , child CP demonstrate inappropriate foot contact area , decrease velocity step length compare child typical development . - Children CP demonstrate impair postural control compare child typical development . - Children CP demonstrate impair gait initiation motor program compare child typical development . - Children CP take time complete time go test demonstrate decrease reach distance functional reach test compare child typical development . AIM 2 : Using single-blinded , randomize , control study design , assess ability 12-week at-home electrical stimulation gait training program improve walk ability , stand posture , gait initiation , functional standing stepping , satisfaction walk ability group 10 child spastic diplegia hemiplegia CP compare group 10 child spastic diplegia hemiplegia CP undergo 12-week at-home gait training program without electrical stimulation . Hypotheses - The ES gait train group demonstrate improve joint coordination compare group undergo gait training program without ES . The ES gait train group demonstrate improve foot contact area , increase self-selected walking velocity great step length compare group undergo gait training program without ES . - The ES gait train group demonstrate improve postural control compare group undergo gait training program without ES . - The ES gait train group demonstrate improve gait initiation compare gait train group without ES . - The ES gait train group demonstrate decrease time Timed Up Go increase functional reach compare group undergo gait training program without ES . - The ES gait train group demonstrate great satisfaction self-perceived performance everyday task relate walk function posture measure COPM compare group undergo gait train program without ES .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single blind , randomize , control pre-test/post-test study design ( Figure 4 ) . The twenty child spastic diplegia hemiplegia CP randomize statistician one two treatment group . One group undergo 12-week at-home gait training program ES , subjects/guardians choose either surface percutaneous stimulation subgroup , second group undergo 12-week at-home gait training program without ES . For group , data collect five point : gait training , 4 8 week gait training , conclusion gait training ( 12 week ) , 4 week gait train discontinue ( 16 week post initiation gait training ) . Data collection follow-up point include kinetics kinematics walk , stand posture , gait initiation , plantar pressure , administration Timed Up &amp; Go Functional Reach Test , assessment low extremity muscle strength use hand-held dynamometer . The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure ( COPM ) apply 12-week gait training program 4 week gait train discontinue . For 20 child typical development , data collect ( except COPM ) use comparison pre-training data collect 20 child CP .</detailed_description>
