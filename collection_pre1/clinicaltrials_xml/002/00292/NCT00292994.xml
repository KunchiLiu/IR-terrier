	<brief_summary>The Metabolic Syndrome ( MS ) prevalent American population strongly associate premature coronary disease . Lifestyle intervention , primarily exercise dietary change , foundational treatment strategy independent component MS , intervention thoroughly evaluate MS . Even modest weight loss , set caloric restriction exercise , mark improvement MS parameter note . However , know whether diet weight loss exercise improve metabolic derangement associate MS. We propose study design examine relative impact diet exercise component MS . Furthermore , know psychological factor significantly impact ability patient initiate sustain lifestyle change . We monitor certain psychological state evaluate impact success weight loss sustainability lifestyle change throughout study . Specific Aims : 1 . ) Evaluate relative efficacy diet weight loss exercise improve marker metabolic syndrome . 2 . ) Determine pre-existing psychological factor influence effectiveness diet weight loss exercise marker metabolic syndrome . Design : Adult woman ( &gt; 18 yr ) body-mass index ( BMI )  30 kg/m2 assess MS randomize one three group ( n = 34/group ) , Control ( C ) , diet weight loss alone ( D ) , exercise alone ( E ) . The intervention group participate supervise dietary change design weight loss exercise 6 month . Anthropomorphic , serologic , psychological parameter monitor compare use ANOVA . Hypothesis : As indexed improvement laboratory marker component metabolic syndrome , exercise alone profound positive impact Metabolic Syndrome diet weight loss alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research procedure : The intervention study caloric dietary restriction intend result 10 % reduction body weight within 6 month , supervise aerobic exercise program design improve cardiovascular fitness . The diet weight loss group meet register dietician weekly basis first 2 month bi-weekly duration study education review subject ’ caloric intake . Similarly , exercise group subject participate weekly supervise aerobic exercise session . At visit , food logbook exercise logbook turn study staff review . Prior inclusion study , patient ’ medical record review evidence metabolic syndrome , specifically , recent lipid analysis , blood sugar , weight , height , waist circumference , blood pressure . A self-report history physical examination form , Perceived Behavior Control Scale , Self-Efficacy Scale , Beck Depression Inventory also include part enrollment process ongoing participation . Pre-intervention/initial screen include fast triglyceride , HDL , glucose , hs-CRP , Uric Acid , insulin , plasma creatinine , 24-hour urine collection , blood pressure , waist hip circumference , height , weight , VO2 max estimate sub maximal standardize treadmill exercise test , Beck Depression Inventory , Perceived Behavioral Control Scale , Self-Efficacy Scale Pre-intervention 3-day food record physical activity questionnaire ass baseline diet activity level . During study monitoring : daily exercise log ( exercise group ) , assessed weekly , ( determine intensity , duration , frequency aerobic exercise ) , daily food log ( diet weight loss group ) , assess caloric intake , quarterly 3-day food record , assess caloric intake , composition fat , carbohydrate protein , quarterly blood pressure , weight , height , waist hip circumference , quarterly fasting serum triglyceride , HDL , fast serum glucose , uric acid , quarterly physical activity questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory , Perceived Behavioral Control Scale , Self-Efficacy Scale . Post-study assessment : fasting serum triglyceride , HDL , serum glucose , uric acid , hs-CRP , insulin , plasma creatinine , 24-hour urine collection , body weight , height , waist hip circumference , VO2 max estimate sub maximal standardize treadmill exercise test , 3-day food record , physical activity questionnaire , Beck Depression Inventory , Perceived Behavioral Control Scale , Self-Efficacy Scale . The control group complete pre post measurement 3-day food record physical activity questionnaire require diet exercise group .</detailed_description>
