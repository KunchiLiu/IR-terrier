	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether new colonoscopic viewing technique call narrow band imaging ( NBI ) help doctor detect patient leat one pre-cancerous area ( dysplasia associate lession mass , MALMs ) conventional colonoscopy use white light alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NBI With Magnification Dysplasia Detection Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer second commonest cause cancer death . Patients colitis substantially increase risk death colorectal cancer increase lenght time patient colitis . This high 30 % chance colorectal cancer 30 year colitis . Colonoscopic surveillance colitis patient show reduce risk colorectal cancer allow detection earlier stage , even meticulous examination , precancerous lesion cancer miss . Precancerous lesion colitis difficult see endoscopist use spray dye line bowel ( chromoendoscopy ) successfully improve detection abnormal area : however time consume require extra time equipment despite benefit see multiple study widely use routine clinical practice UK . Narrow band imaging ( NBI ) technique relies light filter improve contrast small blood vessel bowel line show precancerous area richer vascular network . It sometimes describe `` digital chromoendoscopy '' image produce similar chromoendoscopy , much simpler quicker use . With magnification allows assessment fine mucosal surface pattern ( pit pattern ) lesion allow assessment likelihood precancerous . Autofluorescence endoscopy us short wavelength light light filter produce false colour image bowel line polyp stand . These technique use success oesophagus stomach little work available colon . We aim see NBI magnification well standard colonoscopy detect precancerous area . This likely produce image similar chromoendoscopy already show help . If potentially precancerous area find use type endoscopy , particularly NBI autofluorescence see technique helpful discriminate pre-cancerous non pre-cancerous area</detailed_description>
