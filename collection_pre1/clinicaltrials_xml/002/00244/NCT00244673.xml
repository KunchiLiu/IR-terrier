	<brief_title>Randomized Study Not Giving Diphteria-tetanus-pertussis Vaccination With After Measles Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Infectious disease main cause high child mortality Africa . In several non-randomised study , routine childhood vaccination observe non-targeted effect . Live vaccine like measles vaccine ( MV ) seem protect overall mortality , whereas kill vaccine , like DTP , may beneficial effect , especially girl . DTP provide MV may associate increased mortality . The mechanism behind effect unknown . Hypothesis : Not provide DTP together MV associate 35 % reduction overall mortality 23 % reduction hospitalization . Objectives : To examine randomise study 6000 child effect administer DTP simultaneously MV 1 . Overall child mortality 2 . Hospitalization rate major cause hospitalization 3 . The immunological profile vaccination 4 . Sex-differences mention outcome Methods : Surveillance system : BHP 's demographic surveillance system Bissau cover 6 district population 90,000 ; 3,500 child born year . Hospitalizations : There one pediatric ward Bissau hospitalization identify BHP register . Vaccinations : Vaccinations provide registered 3 health centre study area . Intervention : In study 6000 child randomise come receive DTP3 DTP booster measles vaccination ( MV ) local health centre . Children randomise DTP3+OPV3 MV versus OPV3 MV DTP4+OPV4 versus OPV4 ( booster dos ) . Follow-up : The child follow 4 year age end study . 1 . Adverse effect : In first month vaccination , 1000 child visit daily three day weekly register morbidity consultation . 2 . Hospitalizations : The child follow pediatric ward . 3 . Mortality : Children follow routine surveillance system . Furthermore , child visit yearly finally reach four year age . When death detect , physician conduct verbal autopsy . Sample size : With total 7500 person-years follow-up , able document 35 % reduction mortality 23 % reduction hospitalization . A subgroup child examine possible difference immunological profile vaccination . Ethical consideration : Herd immunity pertussis affect , due intervention , child vaccinate .</detailed_description>
