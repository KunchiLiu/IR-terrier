	<brief_summary>This study use experimental method deliver enzyme glucocerebrosidase directly brain patient Gaucher disease treat disease symptom . Patients Gaucher disease insufficient level glucocerebrosidase . As result , substance normally break enzyme accumulate body , cause damage brain organ . Symptoms Gaucher disease outside brain treat infuse miss enzyme intravenously ( IV , vein ) . However , IV infusion help neurologic symptom disease , enzyme get brain . This study use new technique call convection-enhanced delivery try introduce glucocerebrosidase directly brain . This single-patient study include 8-month-old male Type 2 Gaucher disease progressive neurological decline . In preparation enzyme infusion , patient complete physical examination , include detailed neurological examination , blood urine test . On day surgery , child place general anesthesia magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . For procedure , child lie table move scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug protect hear loud knock thump sound occur scan process . He bring operate room infusion procedure , follow : An incision make scalp small hole drill skull . Then , small tube ( cannula ) position hole target area brain . Once tip cannula place , connect tube syringe fill glucocerebrosidase saline ( salt water ) . The child second MRI scan make sure cannula place correctly monitor delivery glucocerebrosidase brain . The child monitor closely MRI scan every 30 60 minute infusion look fluid brain determine extent enzyme perfusion . The infusion last long 6 hour stop full dose enzyme deliver . The cannula remove scalp incision close . The child stay hospital observation 4 10 day , least 24 hour intensive care unit 3 7 day pediatric unit . The child see clinic two week discharge month 3 month evaluate possible effect surgery . These follow-up visit include repeat MRI scan neurological examination . After first 3 month , visit may less frequent . If child continue symptoms course follow-up neurologic status worsens , additional enzyme infusion offer , possibly include treatment brainstem . If child gain benefit three infusion perform , additional infusion offer . If appear neurological benefit , additional infusion may offer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Convection-Enhanced Delivery Glucocerebrosidase Treat Type 2 Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective . To overcome previous delivery limitation provide enzyme deficient sit central nervous system ( CNS ) Type 2 Gaucher disease patient , investigate use convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) perfuse specific site within CNS glucocerebrosidase effort ameliorate patient 's neurologic symptomatology prolong life . Study population . This single patient study include male infant ( 8 month age ) Type 2 Gaucher disease diagnose clinical , laboratory genetic testing . The natural history acute neuronopathic ( Type 2 ) Gaucher disease progressive neurological decline rapidly fatal . Design . We propose use CED glucocerebrosidase CNS treat neurologic sign symptom Type 2 Gaucher patient . Regions infusion within CNS target base neurologic finding . Outcome measure . Detailed clinical neurologic examination perform pre- ( 3 day infusion ) post-infusion ( 1 , 14 , 30 , 90 day infusion every 3 month study completion ) determine stabilization improvement neurologic sign symptom . Survival also use determine efficacy treatment .</detailed_description>
