	<detailed_description>Percutaneous liver biopsy utilized decade assess severity chronic liver disease , regardless etiology . During procedure core sample liver obtain examine histologically presence inflammation , fibrosis feature characteristic specific liver disorders.Although liver biopsy gold standard ass liver disease severity procedure significant limitation . Liver biopsy costly , invasive procedure risk morbidity mortality . In addition , liver biopsy examination liver histology subject sample variation manner finding evaluate report individual pathologist . Because limitation several investigator attempt develop alternative method assess liver disease severity . One approach development serum marker estimate liver fibrosis . Such test develop analyze battery serum liver chemistry platelet count . Unfortunately , test detect subtle change liver fibrosis provide information regard hepatic function patient establish cirrhosis . The concept metabolic liver function test , could utilize assess liver function first explore several decade ago ( 20 ) . Such test perform administer compound either orally intravenously . The compound remove liver blood , metabolize metabolic product release back blood excrete urine , saliva exhale breath ; metabolic product excrete bile . Measuring amount administer product remain serum time amount metabolic product produce and/or rate product excrete provide accurate measure hepatic metabolic function . Breath test utilize 13C labeled substrate provide safe , non-invasive mean measure hepatic metabolism . 13C stable , non-radioactive isotope incorporate specific location within test substrate would release compound metabolize liver . Ideally , 13C-compound would administer orally , rapidly absorb , metabolize liver 13CO2 would measure exhaled breath within 20-30 minute . Hepatic metabolism compound would assess measure ratio 13C/12C exhale breath . The ability detect , differentiate quantify 13C 12C exhale CO2 greatly facilitate recent development Breath IDÂ® collection system analyzer unit . This portable device continuously sense exhaled breath analyze CO2 real-time nasal cannula worn patient .</detailed_description>
