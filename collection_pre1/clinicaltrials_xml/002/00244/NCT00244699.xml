	<brief_summary>The propose study evaluate clinical effectiveness integrate mindfulness-based skill train standardized brief group intervention youth ( age 16 24 ) identify problematic substance use . Forty youth ( N = 20 per group ) randomize one two treatment condition : 1 ) standardize 4-week brief treatment problematic substance use ( treatment usual ; TAU ) 2 ) standardize brief treatment ( TAU ) augment mindfulness skill train component base primarily mindfulness module describe Linehan 's ( 1993b ) Dialectical Behavior Therapy skill group training . It expect , compare TAU , mindfulness-based group plus TAU produce superior outcome follow primary outcome measure : number substance use day , confidence resist urge use substance , mindfulness skill . Secondary outcome examine include severity consequence use , general psychiatric symptom , self-compassion , emotion dysregulation , transfer treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrating Mindfulness-Based Skills Training Into Brief Outpatient Treatment Substance Abusing Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For wide range clinical condition ( e.g. , depression , anxiety , chronic pain , stress-related health problem ) , integration mindfulness base intervention clinical treatment yield positive benefit ( e.g. , Kabat-Zinn , 1990 ; Segal , Williams , &amp; Teasdale , 2002 ; see Appendix II list reference study ) . Recently , researcher find mindfulness skill train number beneficial treatment implication substance abuse adult ( e.g. , Alterman , A.I. , Koppenhaver , J , Mulholland , E , Ladden , L , &amp; Baime M. ( 2004 ) ; Breslin , Zack , &amp; McMain , 2002 ; Marcus , 2005 ; Marlatt , 2005 ; Marlatt &amp; Kristeller , 1999 ) . Although researcher recommend mindfulness implement adjunctive treatment addiction , include early stage substance use treatment ( Breslin et al. , 2002 ; Marcus , 2001 ; 2003 ; 2005 ) , study explore whether incorporate mindfulness skill train yield incremental benefit standard treatment alone , whether mindfulness skill clinical utility early stage substance abuse treatment . Moreover , study explore relative benefit incorporate mindfulness skill train treatment problematic substance use among transition-age youth , age group heighten risk development addiction mental health problem ( Beitchman , Adlaf , Douglas , Atkinson , Young , et al. , 2001 ) . The integration mindfulness youth substance abuse treatment would expect yield beneficial effect give developmental pattern impulsivity emotion dysregulation frequently characterize population ( Winters , 1999 ) . Researchers use mindfulness paradigm propose one key beneficial mechanism produce mindfulness emotional regulation ( e.g. , Linehan , 1993a , 1993b ; see Roemer , 2003 ) . By increase mindfulness , thereby emotion regulation , therapy client undergo mindfulness skill train would expect experience enhance capacity resist impulse act substance use urge ( Breslin et al. , 2002 ) . Thus , integrated treatment usual , mindfulness skill train would expect positive , incremental effect client ' ability reduce level substance use course substance abuse treatment . This study address question : Does integration mindfulness-based skill train standardized brief substance abuse treatment ( TAU ) youth enhance treatment outcome compare standardized treatment ( TAU ) alone ? Clinical outcome compare youth randomize one two treatment condition : ) TAU control condition , consist evidence-based , standardized brief treatment group deliver approximately 2-hour session per week four week ( i.e. , First Contact group ; Breslin , Li , Sdao-Jarvie , Tupker , &amp; Ittig-Delan , 2002 ) , b ) experimental treatment condition , consist TAU enhance mindfulness skill train component base primarily mindfulness module describe Linehan 's ( 1993 ) Skills Training Manual Treating Borderline Personality Disorder ( Linehan , 1993b ) , recent adaptation skill substance use problem ( McMain , Dimeff , Sayrs , Davis , &amp; Linehan , 2005 ) , youth population ( Miller , Rathus , Landsman , &amp; Linehan , press ) . This study explore whether , compare TAU , treatment augment mindfulness skill train beneficial impact clinical outcome , include confidence resist substance use urge , number substance use day , development mindfulness skill . The primary hypothesis , compare TAU , group receive treatment enhance mindfulness skill train report follow : ( 1 ) low number substance use day , ( 2 ) great confidence resist urge use substance , ( 3 ) high level mindfulness skill . Secondary analysis explore extent experimental condition relate beneficial effect follow : ( 1 ) negative consequence substance use , ( 2 ) psychiatric symptom , ( 3 ) difficulty emotion regulation , ( 4 ) self-compassion , ( 5 ) rate transfer treatment , ( 6 ) premature treatment termination .</detailed_description>
