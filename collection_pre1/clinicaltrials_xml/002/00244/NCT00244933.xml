	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine objective response rate patient stage IV breast cancer treat gemcitabine hydrochloride genistein . Secondary - Determine duration response survival patient treat regimen . - Determine time disease progression patient treat regimen . - Determine quantitative qualitative toxic effect regimen patient . - Correlate plasma genistein level response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral genistein daily day -7 1 . Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 1 8 oral genistein daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
