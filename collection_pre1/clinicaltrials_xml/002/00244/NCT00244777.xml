	<brief_summary>The World Health Organization recently recommend routine use hypo-osmolar ORS management diarrhoeal diseases . This recommendation base well efficacy hypo-osmolar ORS standard WHO ORS demonstrate controlled clinical trial . The recommendation , however , also express need `` careful monitoring good ass risk , , symptomatic hyponatraemia '' . There thus need phase IV trials new solution introduce routine clinical practice ass risk relatively large number patient population . The propose study carry two different settings- urban setting Dhaka Hospital ( 60000 patient ) rural setting Matlab Hospital ( 15000 patient ) ICDDR , B . The hypo-osmolar rice glucose-based ORS introduce standard management patient diarrhoea . The hypo-osmolar ORS contain 75 mmol /L sodium instead 90 mmol/L . Surveillance carry detect adverse event focus occurrence seizure undue lethargy hospitalization . Each episode seizure undue lethargy would evaluate determine associate abnormal level serum sodium glucose , fever . It estimate 3 % ( 1,800 ) patient initially admit Short Stay Ward Dhaka Hospital , 340 patient Matlab Hospital might require admission longer stay inpatient ward due seizure alter consciousness . Such patient would thoroughly assessed include determination serum sodium glucose , two common cause seizures/altered consciousness , determine extent could attribute hyponatraemia.The result study would use plan implement routine use new formulation ORS Government , NGO private health care facility treat diarrhoeal patient , Bangladesh country .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study site : The Dhaka Matlab Hospitals ICDDR , B : Centre Health Population Research . Duration : Total duration 15 month include data collection full year capture seasonal variation aetiology diarrhoea . Sample size : Based yearly patient visit estimate 60,000 patient would study Dhaka Hospital 15,000 patient Matlab Hospital . Inclusion criterion All patient attend Dhaka Matlab hospital admit Short Stay Ward uncomplicated watery diarrhoea would eligible study . Exclusion criteria Patients complication , severe illness require special care multiple intervention would exclude . Procedures Infants 6 month age young would receive glucose-based ( 75 mmol/L ) ORS ( Na : 75 , Cl : 65 , K : 20 , citrate:10 , glucose : 75 , osmolarity : 245 mOsm/L ) , old 6 month would receive rice-based ORS ( 40 g/L rice powder ) ; contain 75 mmol/L sodium , 65 mmol/L chloride , 20 mmol/L potassium , 10 mmol/L citrate vitro osmolarity 170 mOsm/L . This line Centre 's policy add starch management infant 6 month age young . Surveillance case management Dhaka Hospital : From experience 3 % patient ( 1,800 patients/year ) initially admit Short Stay Ward subsequently admit Longer Stay Wards due development symptom like seizure , lethargy alter consciousness . Patients admit Short Stay Ward receive ORS solution 8 hour , subsequently admit inpatient ward symptom evaluate determine due hyponatraemia . Similarly , 3 % patient attend Matlab Hospital ( 340 patients/year ) might develop symptom evaluate symptom due hyponatraemia . All clinical laboratory data patient maintain study . Assessment management patient Hospitals current protocol assessment cause lethargy seizure estimation plasma glucose , serum electrolyte , fever , study cerebrospinal fluid clinically indicate would employ diagnose aetiology symptom . Protocol management seizure Although rare , development seizure rehydration therapy acute watery diarrhoea would consider serious adverse event . Patients develop symptom would assed determine could attribute hyponatraemia . The protocol management seizure would use study site , would follow : Procedures : - All patient develop significant lethargy seizure ORS would immediately admit special care unit . - An intravenous line open medication . - Blood glucose measure immediately finger blood sample use bedside glucose monitoring machine , blood sample would obtain estimation serum electrolyte , calcium , magnesium clinical laboratory Centre . - Hypoglycaemic ( &lt; 2.2 mmol/L ) patient would immediately give intravenous glucose ( 25 % glucose ; 2 ml/kg ) , would follow oral ( nasogastric tube patient unable drink ) administration 10 % glucose dose xxxxx - Diazepam ( 0.3 mg/Kg ) would administer patient hypoglycaemia , also patient hypoglycaemic respond initial glucose infusion . - If seizure persist , dose intravenous diazepam would repeat second time , injectable phenobarbitone would also administer ( 15-20 mg/kg load dose , follow 2.5 mg/Kg every 12 hour maintenance dose ) . - After control seizure , lumber tap do rule meningitis clinically indicate ( i.e . patient suspect meningitis ) . - A sample blood also send culture exclude septicaemia - X-Ray chest do exclude pneumonia clinically indicate ( follow WHO guideline ) - Patients serum sodium â‰¤120 mmol/L treat 3 % NaCl dose 1 ml/Kg.hour next 4 hour ( i.e . total 12 ml/Kg 4-hour period ) , along restriction plain water . - Hypernatraemic patient ( serum sodium &gt; 150 mmol/L ) would treat ORS provision water ad lib . - Patients suspect extra intestinal infection include sepsis treat Inj . Ampicillin Inj . Gentamicin ( infant age 3 month young ) Inj . Ceftriaxone Gentamicin ( patient age 3 month ) 7 day .</detailed_description>
