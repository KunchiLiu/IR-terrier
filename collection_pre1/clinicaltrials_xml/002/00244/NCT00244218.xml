	<brief_title>Response Phenylketonuria Tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) autosomal recessive disorder cause defect enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . incidence PKU US 1:15,000 birth . The disease pan ethnic prevalence among individual European ancestry . Recently , number patient PKU show marked decrease blood Phe level cofactor PAH , tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) give orally . All patient mutation PAH metabolism BH4 normal . These observation confirm several center include pilot study conduct institution . In study center , identify 21 36 patient test respond favorably BH4 . Recognizing difficulty phenylalanine restrict diet , NIH Consensus Conference PKU hold 1999 , encourage explore different modality treat PKU , BH4 among modality . This proposal three year , double blind placebo control , multi-center study . An oral load 10 mg/kg BH4 wil give patient PKU identify respond lower blood Phe great equal 30 % . Blood Phe , tyrosine dietary intake determine zero time 24 hour post load . From group BH4 responsive individual , thirty-six enrol double blind study . subject randomize treatment placebo group . Those enter trial zero time assessment include blood Phe tyrosine , dietary intake , physical exam , kidney function , liver function CBC . Phe tyrosine diet intake , two prior study zero time , average use baseline measure . The subject assign randomly take either 10mg/kg BH4 orally placebo without BH4 . Blood Phe , tyrosine dietary intake obtain every week throughout 12 week study period . Liver function kidney function CBC 's obtain monthly . Side effect evaluate noted . Subjects instruct record two day diet diary prior blood Phe sample throughout study . The NIH Consensus Report suggest maintain blood Phe &lt; 36 umol/l less 12 year age 900 umol/l 12 year age . These level use determine efficacy end point study . At end three month , blood Phe tyrosine , dietary intake , physical exam , kidney function , liver function CBC perform . At time efficacy BH4 determine subject continue open label 12 week BH4 treatment , ( 10mg/kg/day ) , assessment collect first phase study . After subject phase follow additional 3 month . The additional 3 month trial BH4 provide long term safety data 18 subject take BH4 first second phase continuous fashion .</detailed_description>
