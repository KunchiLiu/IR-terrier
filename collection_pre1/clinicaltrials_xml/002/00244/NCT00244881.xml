	<brief_title>A Phase II Study AZD2171 Breast Cancer Stage IV ( 10006202 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluation fraction patient increase level circulate endothelial cell 3 week treatment AZD2171 . II . Estimation objective response rate ( ORR = CR + PR ) among patient refractory breast cancer receive AZD2171 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Estimation response/stable disease rate ( RSDR = CR + PR + SD ) . II . Characterization toxicity associate AZD2171 cohort patient . III . Analyses correlate serial quantification circulate endothelial cell circulate tumor cell traditional clinical endpoint include RR TTP . IV . Develop pharmacodynamic measure AZ2171 activity base monocyte count VEGFR-1 phosphorylation within monocyte . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily 42 day . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 26 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
