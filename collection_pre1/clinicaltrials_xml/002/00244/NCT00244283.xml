	<brief_summary>To compare two different method protect heart muscle damage cause decreased blood supply . Exposure anaesthetic agent sevoflurane allow heart muscle resist long period low blood oxygen supply without sustain amount damage would otherwise expect . The use thoracic epidural analgesia improve blood flow heart muscle also show reduce amount damage heart muscle may otherwise sustain . The aim study compare two method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Two Anaesthetic Methods Protecting Heart Tissue During Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) common procedure perform improve blood flow heart patient severe ischaemic heart disease . Commonly , heart stop allow procedure perform often achieve cool heart perfuse solution stop activity heart muscle . These technique stop heart beating allow surgery perform also reduce oxygen requirement heart . This turn reduce damage heart suffers reduce blood flow occur artery operate . Unfortunately , however , technique completely eliminate risk heart muscle damage new method reduce damage heart continually investigate . Two method relate anaesthetic technique use recently identify potentially benefit regard â€“ use volatile anaesthetic agent use high thoracic epidural analgesia . Volatile anaesthetic agent extensively investigate past year regard apparent ability mimic ischaemic preconditioning . Ischaemic precondition refers phenomenon heart tissue expose frequent , short episode reduce blood oxygen supply , follow long spell , heart likely suffer small area damage never expose brief ischaemic spell . This related clinically observation patient angina , subsequently suffer heart attack , good prognosis patient suffer heart attack without ever experience angina prior event . There numerous study demonstrate volatile anaesthetic agent ( isoflurane , sevoflurane , desflurane ) appear mimic phenomenon , animal human model . Numerous study demonstrate favourable postoperative blood concentration cardiac troponin I ( sensitive marker heart damage ) , CK-MB ( another marker heart damage ) , atrial brain natriueretic peptide ( marker heart function ) compare receive preconditioning . It therefore suggest may improve outcome follow cardiac surgery . High thoracic epidural analgesia ( HTEA ) also show beneficial follow cardiac surgery . This involve place small catheter near nerve leave spinal cord . Local anaesthetic ccan administer catheter numb area body supply nerve . This provide good pain relief widely use hospital operation . It show associated short time require artificial ventilation compare standard pain relief drug morphine . It also suggest may influence outcome improved heart function follow operation compare without HTEA . It appear improve blood flow heart . It also associate low postoperative concentration cardiac troponin , CK-MB , atrial brain natriuretic peptide . There direct comparison two technique , however , ass one superior , benefit two technique additive . Comparison : This study aim ass one technique confers benefit benefit additive . This important many centre use thoracic epidural analgesia cardiac surgery clinician currently use volatile anaesthetic cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
