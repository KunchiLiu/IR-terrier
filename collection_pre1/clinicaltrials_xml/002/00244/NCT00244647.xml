	<brief_summary>The process re-narrowing coronary artery follow revascularization procedure angioplasty , begin time procedure . Restenosis long consider major problem effective long-term interventional success . This often result repeat procedure deal recurrent stenosis ( restenosis ) original targeted vessel . There substantial body literature suggest local MYC protein production injure coronary artery major stimulus potential cause restenosis appear stent placement . This study base upon hypothesis stop MYC protein production vessel help reduce restenosis ( vessel re-narrowing ) . AVI BioPharma Inc. , utilized proprietary antisense chemistry design drug interfere MYC production . This study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics potential effectiveness single intravenous slow-push dose RESTEN-MP time stent placement reduce in-stent restenosis follow balloon angioplasty stent placement . The post-dose follow-up period six-months .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Study Evaluating RESTEN-MP Subjects With Focal de Novo Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The process restenosis follow revascularization procedure , begin time percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Restenosis long see major impediment effective long-term interventional cardiology , necessitate repeat procedure deal situ recurrent stenosis original targeted vessel . The restenosis rate 30 50 % patient treat balloon angioplasty 15 30 % patient treat bare metal stent . There currently high enthusiasm drug-eluting stent already approve market overall restenosis rate &lt; 3 % report publish report clinical trial patient population . However , subset patient ( e.g. , diabetic patient patient diffuse small vessel disease ) restenosis rate around 10 % despite use drug-eluting stent . It probably early conclude currently approve drug-eluting stent panacea relieve coronary arterial obstruction due atherosclerotic heart disease . In fact , increase usage current drug-eluting stent market , report problem late stent malposition , subacute late thromboses , aneurysm formation due vessel toxicity associate method treatment . There remain definite need simple , safe durable solution restenosis . The development device intravascular ultrasound lead great understanding restenosis mechanism , especially coronary artery stenting . It presume pathogenesis coronary artery restenosis revascularization procedure entail two major process . The first component ( viz. , recoil remodel ) involve mechanical collapse constriction treat vessel ; however , coronary stent provide luminal scaffolding eliminates recoil remodel . The second component coronary artery restenosis revascularization procedure endothelial response injury . Whereas , former focus modulate pathophysiological mechanism involve restenosis center mainly inhibition platelet aggregation function , current target pharmaceutical agent condition shift inhibitor cell cycle , smooth muscle cell proliferation migration , synthesis extra-cellular matrix , inflammatory mediator . Many different agent currently evaluate pre-clinical clinical study . AVI-4126 , active ingredient RESTEN-MP , proprietary antisense drug design interfere ability human &lt; c-myc &gt; gene translate mRNA MYC protein . Slow-push intravenous administration RESTEN-MP pharmacological dos restenosis porcine model prevent subsequent in-stent stenosis . In addition standard safety assessment , assessment potential therapeutic value RESTEN-MP neointimal hyperplasia inhibitor include late loss time stent placement 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
