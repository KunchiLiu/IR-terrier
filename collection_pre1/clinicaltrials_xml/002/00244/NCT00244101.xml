	<brief_title>Delivery Room Management Trial Premature Infants High Risk Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The `` Delivery room management premature infant high risk respiratory distress syndrome '' protocol compare three distinct method post-delivery stabilization subsequent early respiratory care chronic lung disease survival premature infant high risk respiratory distress syndrome . The three approach post-delivery care include : 1 . Intubation , prophylactic surfactant administration shortly delivery , subsequent stabilization ventilator support . 2 . Early stabilization nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( NCPAP ) selective intubation surfactant administration clinical indication . 3 . Intubation , prophylactic surfactant administration shortly delivery rapid extubation nasal CPAP . The primary null hypothesis study difference find chronic lung disease and/or mortality 36 week adjust age premature infant high risk RDS , depend method post-delivery stabilization . The study randomize , multicenter trial conduct participate Vermont Oxford Network Centers . Participating center demonstrate competency use nasal CPAP successfully complete web-based , educational program utilizing nasal CPAP minimum 20 infant NICU . Infants likely delivered woman present participate Vermont Oxford Network Center high risk premature delivery gestational age 26 + 0 29 + 6 week eligible inclusion . Specific inclusion criterion must meet prior randomization include : 1. imminent delivery 2. potentially life-threatening congenital anomaly genetic syndrome 3. know lung maturity 4. antenatal steroid status know 5. write informed consent obtain prior delivery . Exclusion criterion include : 1. stillborn infant ( Apgar score 0 one minute age ) 2. infant note potentially life-threatening congenital anomaly genetic syndrome note immediately delivery . Eligible infant consent obtain prior delivery . They stratify two group : 26 + 0 27 + 6 week gestation 28 + 0 29 + 6 week gestation . Shortly delivery , infant randomize one three stabilization strategy detail : 1 . Intubation , prophylactic surfactant administration shortly delivery , subsequent stabilization ventilator support ( PS group ) . 2 . Early stabilization nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( NCPAP ) select intubation surfactant administration clinical indication ( NCPAP group ) . 3 . Intubation , prophylactic surfactant administration shortly delivery , rapid extubation nasal CPAP ( ISX group ) . Infants require intubation respiratory failure study ( three group ) may stabilize either conventional high-frequency ventilation . Specific criterion regard target range blood gas indication extubation , subsequent surfactant dosing , management extubation , criterion reintubation , detail protocol . The primary outcome measure chronic lung disease ( define document requirement supplemental oxygen respiratory support ) mortality 36 week adjust age . Secondary outcome measure include variety clinical outcome , well issue regard duration hospital stay resource utilization . Long-term outcome measure health care questionnaire two year age . A sample size 895 infant require demonstrate 25 % reduction risk chronic lung disease 36 week adjust age .</detailed_description>
