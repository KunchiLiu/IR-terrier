	<brief_summary>Due overall disease free survival 85 % 100 % , allogeneic blood bone marrow stem cell transplantation use HLA match sibling donor therapy choice patient severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) . Unfortunately , 25 % patient donor . For patient SAA lack match sibling donor , immunosuppressive therapy current treatment choice . Approximately 70 % patient complete partial response immunosuppressive therapy , achieve transfusion independence and/or growth factor independence . For approximately 30 % patient respond immunosuppressive therapy experience recurrence , alternative donor ( match unrelated , partially match family member ) transplantation treatment option . However , graft rejection graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) significant barrier success , decrease event-free survival 30 % 50 % . This study offer stem cell transplantation use partially match family member ( haploidentical ) donor patient available HLA-matched sibling match unrelated donor . In attempt reduce GVHD regimen-related toxicity maintain adequate engraftment , plan infuse highly purified stem cell graft . The Miltenyi Biotec CliniMACS CD3 depletion system use derive define allogeneic graft highly enrich CD34+ hematopoietic cell deplete CD3+ T-lymphocytes G-CSF mobilize , donor-derived peripheral blood stem cell . Patients 21 year age young refractory cytopenia also eligible protocol potentially curative therapy currently available condition . The primary objective study evaluate safety transplantation use haploidentical donor product engineer target cell count use investigational CliniMACS device patient refractory severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) refractory cytopenia . The treatment plan would consider unsafe find type procedure associate significantly higher treatment failure rate . Treatment failure define occurrence follow event , overall grade III-IV acute GVHD , graft failure death due cause within 100 day transplant .</brief_summary>
