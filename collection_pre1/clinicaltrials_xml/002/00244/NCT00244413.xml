	<detailed_description>Nondystrophic myotonia muscle disorder cause abnormal muscle cell membrane protein affect control muscle fiber contraction . These disorder extremely rare , little known best treat various subtypes NDM . The purpose study characterize clinical feature symptom NDM well pair data specific NDM subtypes . In turn , may lead development improved treatment . The study also establish clinical endpoint use future study . This multi-center observational study involve cross-sectional data analysis prospective longitudinal analysis . Participants initially attend one-day outpatient study visit . Various baseline measurement collect , include demographic , medical history , quality life measure . Blood sample take evaluate laboratory value genetic factor . Participants undergo manual muscle test ( MMT ) , clinical myotonia assessment , functional movement assessment . Routine nerve conduction study electromyography ( EMG ) also perform order test presence myotonia specific muscle . Annual follow-up evaluation occur 1 2 year follow first study visit .</detailed_description>
