	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Drugs , leuprolide bicalutamide , may stop adrenal gland make androgen . Squalamine lactate may stop growth prostate cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving hormone therapy together squalamine lactate surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give hormone therapy together squalamine lactate work compare hormone therapy alone treat patient undergo radical prostatectomy locally advanced prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Therapy With Without Squalamine Lactate Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare effect neoadjuvant androgen-ablation therapy v without squalamine lactate induce tumor regression grade migration patient locally advance high-risk adenocarcinoma prostate undergoing radical prostatectomy . - Compare duration clinical disease-free survival patient treat regimen . - Determine applicability prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) serology endpoint determinant patient treat regimen . - Compare feasibility potential safety effect wound heal recovery patient treat regimens radical prostatectomy . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive leuprolide intramuscularly month 3 month oral bicalutamide day 2 week . - Arm II : Patients receive leuprolide bicalutamide arm I plus squalamine lactate IV 4 hour weekly 6 week . Seven week begin treatment , patient arm undergo standard radical prostatectomy . Patients continue receive leuprolide bicalutamide without squalamine lactate 6 additional week . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically least 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 132 patient ( 66 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
