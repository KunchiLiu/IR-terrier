	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare satisfaction physician-patient communication decisional conflict patient metastatic cancer undergo computer-based survey v without communication aid . - Compare patient expectation regard potential benefit adverse reaction associate treatment option patient undergo computer-based survey communication aid . - Compare content physician-patient consultation patient undergo computer-based survey communication aid . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 3 study arm . - Arm I ( generic computer-based survey ) : Patients complete 45- 60-minute generic computer-based survey assess demographic , familiarity comfort computer , treatment history , affective element . - Arm II ( target computer-based survey communication aid physician summary report ) : Patients complete 45- 60-minute target computer-based survey assess patient value , information need , distress . Patients complete target computer-based communication aid address cognitive affective component cancer treatment education provide communication skill training . After completion survey communication aid , summary report survey result generate provided patient 's physician . - Arm III ( target computer-based survey communication aid ) : Patients complete target computer-based survey communication aid arm II . No summary report provide physician . After completion computer-based survey communication aid , patient undergo consultation physician . A randomized subset 25 % physician consultations* audiotaped later analyze . Patients complete 15-minute write survey completion physician consultation 3 month . NOTE : *Patients stratify accord study arm ( I vs II v III ) consult physician gender randomization . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 720 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
