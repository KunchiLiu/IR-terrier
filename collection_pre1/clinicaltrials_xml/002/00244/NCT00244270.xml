	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate incidence venous thrombosis occur totally implantable vascular access device cystic fibrosis patient need new device ( first one subsequent one ) study genetic risk factor thrombosis adjust acquired one . It nationwide cohort study plan two year six month follow period . The expected number inclusion 50 patient year , say 100 whole study . In cystic fibrosis , pulmonary exacerbation necessitate repeat intravenous antibiotic , peripheral blood access become precarious time , lead indication central venous device . It important take lot precaution protect vascular access . This allow patient dramatic improvement life expectancy life-long device ( ONM , French National Observatory France 2003 : median 36 year ) . Venous thrombosis cause superior cava syndrome , pleural effusion pulmonary embolism . The risk thrombosis significant ; retrospectively , evaluate 4 16 % publication . This rate may higher due fact venous thrombosis may remain asymptomatic , therefore silent , lead risk vascular access loss .</brief_summary>

This rate may higher due fact venous thrombosis may remain asymptomatic , therefore silent , lead risk vascular access loss . This prospective study try identify venous thrombosis whatever - symptomatic silent - identify genetic acquire risk factor , circumstance occurrence current therapeutic modality . Furthermore , set early treatment still asymptomatic thrombosis allow researcher hope prompt resolution thrombosis .</detailed_description>
