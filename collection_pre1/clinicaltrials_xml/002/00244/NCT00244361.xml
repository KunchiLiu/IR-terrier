	<brief_summary>The purpose study reduce symptom OMS test rituximab ( RituxanÂ® ) , remove B lymphocyte make antibody trigger brain inflammation . Evidence suggest autoimmune brain inflammation cause symptom OMS . This study blood spinal fluid intend find effect rituximab OMS spinal fluid B-cells . Rituximab target destroy B-cells , make antibody attack brain cause may OMS . It infuse vein period several hour . Rituximab use widely study extensively since approval 1997 U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) non-Hodgkin 's B-cell Lymphoma ( NHL ) . Today , 300,000 patient receive rituximab , part 200 complete , ongoing , plan clinical trial . Rituximab FDA-approved OMS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome ( OMS ) rare pervasive , paraneoplastic neurological disorder , purport autoantibody-mediated . We demonstrate expansion B-cells cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) despite tumor resection , chemotherapy , conventional immunotherapy . Whether B-cells purge CSF compartment benefit patient unknown . Targeting CSF B lymphocytes represent novel valuable paradigm shift therapy centrally-mediated paraneoplastic disorder . The objective preliminary study determine rituximab , monoclonal antibody CD20+ B-cells , reduce eliminates CSF B-cells OMS whether reduction result clinical improvement . B lymphocyte subset relevant T-cell subset immunophenotyped CSF peripheral blood child OMS four-color dual-laser flow cytometry . Sixteen child increase percentage CSF B-cells treat rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV weekly four consecutive week CSF test repeat six month frequent clinical evaluation blood test 12 month . Clinical outcome rat blindly videotape experience observer use validated 12-item motor evaluation scale quantifiable parameter sleep , behavior motor function . Immunological outcome variable include percentage B-cell subset quantitative immunoglobulin . Post-treatment result compare pre-treatment value statistically . If rituximab prove efficacious safe method treat CSF B-cell expansion neurological syndrome , study lead phase II trial eventual aim gain FDA approval rituximab indication .</detailed_description>
