	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well give rituximab dexamethasone together work treat patient low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving rituximab together dexamethasone may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate clinical response rate ( RR ) 3 6 month . II . To estimate Grade 2-4 -infusion-related toxicity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate laboratory parameter correlate clinical response include : antibody dependent cell mediate cytotoxicity effector cell phenotype analysis baseline , 4 week three month . II . To evaluate laboratory parameter correlate clinical response include : soluble cluster differentiation ( CD ) 20 fragment CD20-containing membrane fragment baseline , 4 week , 3 month . III . To evaluate laboratory parameter correlate clinical response include : phenotype analysis CD16 CD32 natural killer ( NK ) cell . IV . To evaluate laboratory parameter correlate clinical response include : rituximab pharmacokinetic study baseline , 4 week 3 month . OUTLINE : Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously ( IV ) rituximab IV weekly . Treatment continue 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 month .</detailed_description>
