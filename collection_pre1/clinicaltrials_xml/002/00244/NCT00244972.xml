	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Biopsiable Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety toxicity determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) tipifarnib combination sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Preliminary assessment tipifarnib sorafenib efficacy ( objective response ) . II . To determine signal pathway profile patient treat tipifarnib sorafenib amenable biopsy reverse phase protein microarray ( RPPA ) analysis . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study tipifarnib . Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 tipifarnib PO QD BID day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may allow continue treatment 12 course continue clinical response disease stabilization , patient significant toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
