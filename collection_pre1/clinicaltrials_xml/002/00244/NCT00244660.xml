	<detailed_description>Also beneficial effect optimal blood pressure ( BP ) control well establish , sub-optimal blood pressure control still highly prevalent hypertensive population . The purpose study evaluate effect frequent home ( HBPM ) - 24 hour ( ABPM ) blood pressure measurement achieve BP control patient essential hypertension accord Danish Society Hypertension Gudelines . The study include 120 general practioners ( GP ) randomise perform either usual BP control intensive BP control . Before randomization , participate GPs recruit 10 patient follow period 12 month . At baseline ABPM measure eligible patient . The result baseline ABPM blind usual care group . Following , usual care ( control ) physicians perform BP control accord usual standard . Physicians randomize intensive care control BP use frequent HBPM ABPM . According pre-specified scheme patient follow intensive care physician measure HBP morning evening three consecutive day 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 10 month study . Patients communicate result measurement treat physician , accord result HBPM decide action take . As aid , 6 month patient intensive care group another APBM part follow ensure 24 hour BP control . In usual- intensive care group treatment decision entirely treat physician . No pre-specified treatment algorithm follow non-pharmacological well pharmacological tretment use ( optimize ) BP control . Patients follow intensive care receive extend structure information importance optimal BP control . As primary endpoint change mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic diastolic blood pressure patient group ABPM 12 month . During whole trial , participate physician keep record measure BP ( clinic BP , HBP ABP ) , well relevant blood- urinary test ( lipid , glucose , albuminuria ) take study . Based available information , patient total risk score ( Danish Society Hypertension ) calculate baseline 12 month . Study Hypothesis : Blood pressure control accord Danish Society Hypertension Guidelines well obtain intensive care regimen ( frequent home- ambulatory blood pressure measurement ) compare usual care regimen ( standard blood pressure control Danish general practice ) . Comparison ( ) : Frequent home- ambulatory blood pressure measurement versus standard care .</detailed_description>
