	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) common form dementia . Currently , 4 million individual dementia United States least 400,000 death annually . AD progressive , neurodegenerative disorder , characterize neuropathologically widespread neuronal loss , presence neurofibrillary tangle , deposit beta amyloid cerebral blood vessel neuritic plaque . Since medial-temporal lobe , hippocampus , association cortex significantly impact surprising primary symptom AD decline cognitive function lead mark impairment daily functioning . In particular , memory impairment , visuospatial decline , language difficulty , loss executive function central cognitive symptom illness . Behavioral disturbance agitation hallucination often accompany disease progression . The illness last approximately 7 10 year , patient require total care latter stage . Thus , AD place tremendous emotional economic burden patient caregiver . Beyond cure , therapeutic approach would alleviate symptom delay progression could substantial psychological economic benefit . Recent placebo control clinical trial show memantine efficacious treatment patient moderate severe AD . The aim propose study determine NMDA receptor antagonist memantine neuroprotective effect magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( MRS ) measure brain NAA magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) volumetric measure hippocampal volume . In secondary analysis , determine measure clinical stabilization produce memantine treatment Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) parallel stabilization MRS measure brain NAA MRI volumetric measure hippocampal volume .</detailed_description>
