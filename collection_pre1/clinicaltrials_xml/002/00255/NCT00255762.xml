	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give carboplatin paclitaxel together bevacizumab work treat patient stage IV melanoma remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving carboplatin paclitaxel together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary I . Determine anti-tumor activity carboplatin , paclitaxel , bevacizumab , term progression-free survival , patient unresectable stage IV melanoma . II . Determine toxicity profile regimen patient . Secondary I . Determine distribution overall survival time patient treated regimen . II . Determine response rate patient treat regimen . III . Determine change blood level vascular endothelial growth factor patient treat regimen . IV . Determine change immune homeostasis patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 47 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
