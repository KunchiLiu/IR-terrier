	<brief_summary>Reduction spasticity major focus treatment childhood cerebral palsy , result numerous treatment strategy target various part motor system . However , many child weakness may great contributor disability spasticity . Recent result suggest correlation spasticity weakness , know reduction spasticity improve strength . We suggest simplify model spinal mechanism ( include reflex contribution spasticity ) supraspinal mechanism ( include voluntary contribution strength ) combine activate muscle . The model imply supraspinal contribution increase unless spinal contribution decrease . We therefore hypothesize reduction spasticity improve ability increase voluntary strength . We propose double-masked placebo-controlled clinical trial combine treatment use oral anti-spasticity medication baclofen 6-week program strength training . We enroll 20 ambulatory child spastic diplegic cerebral palsy . Prior follow intervention , obtain quantitative measure spasticity , strength , gait . We predict child take baclofen great increase strength child take placebo . We predict increase strength reflect improved performance gait analysis , correlate reduction quantitative measure spasticity spinal reflex excitability . If hypothesis correct , provide important new information relationship spasticity strength child cerebral palsy . It provide first measurement effect baclofen voluntary muscle activation child . It support short-term use combine anti-spasticity medication strengthen new clinical treatment ankle weakness child spastic diplegia . A successful result immediate significant implication treatment child cerebral palsy .</brief_summary>
