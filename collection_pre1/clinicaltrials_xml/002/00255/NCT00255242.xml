	<brief_summary>Individuals cystic fibrosis ( CF ) persistent infection airway , body attempt fight recruit immune cell ( neutrophil ) lung . The immune system neutrophil unable completely kill bacteria , response infection lead inflammation ( swell ) airways lung damage . Nitric oxide ( NO ) anti-bacterial anti-inflammatory property lung . NO production decrease CF patient , may contribute persistent infection inflammation . Increasing production NO airways CF patient may help decrease inflammation infection . Rho GTPases molecule cell line airways decrease protein make nitric oxide ( NOS ) . Rho proteins also increase inflammation cell . Rho proteins increase CF cell , may partially explain low NO high inflammation see CF . Blocking Rho protein CF cell increase NOS , produce NO . The Rho protein inhibit drug , simvastatin ( Zocor® ) . Simvastatin use million people low cholesterol , safe , side-effects approve use child great 10 year age . We propose treat CF patient simvastatin increase NO produce ( exhaled NO ) , may decrease airway inflammation . If simvastatin expect effect CF , would another drug potential become new therapy fight debilitate lung damage disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease characterize chronic bacterial infection excessive inflammation . The airways patient CF contain large amount neutrophil , neutrophil product , pro-inflammatory mediator . This inflammatory response may link loss CFTR function . It unknown , however , signal mechanism link loss CFTR function excessive inflammatory response . Several signal pathway dysregulated CF epithelial cell . Among pathway lead production nitric oxide ( NO ) . Reduced production NO , important antibacterial anti-inflammatory effect airway , may contribute establishment chronic bacterial infection development subsequent overzealous inflammatory response CF . NO synthesis airway epithelium regulate nitric oxide synthase 2 ( NOS2 ) . NOS2 expression negatively regulate Rho GTPases , over-expressed CF may also play role inflammatory dysregulation characteristic lung disease . Inhibition Rho GTPases 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase ( HMG-CoAR ) inhibitor , simvastatin ( Zocor® ) , increase NOS2 protein expression CF airway epithelial cell . The statin also show potent systemic anti-inflammatory effect , many may pertinent CF . We propose test hypothesis HMG-CoAR inhibitor , simvastatin , potential correct abnormalities NO production decrease inflammation airways patient CF . The follow specific aim pursue application : 1 ) To determine effect simvastatin treatment exhale nitric oxide ( eNO ) concentration subject CF ; 2 ) To determine effect simvastatin treatment inflammation NOS2 production airway subject CF , determine quantitative RT-PCR IL-6 , IL-8 , NOS2 mRNA nasal epithelial cell ; 3 ) To determine quantitative RT-PCR measurement nasal epithelial cell might use surrogate marker low airway inflammation compare measure obtain nasal epithelial scrape inflammatory measurement obtain induced sputum . This study potential identify new agent target signal pathway ( Rho GTPase ) appear dysregulated CF , thus , may exert multiple beneficial effect CF airway include increase airway NO concentration , decrease neutrophil influx reduce production inflammatory mediator . In addition evaluate anti-inflammatory effect statins CF , study present opportunity evaluate alternative outcome measure CF airway inflammation . The result study provide important information regard feasibility use nasal epithelial sample relatively non-invasive measure airway inflammation CF .</detailed_description>
