	<detailed_description>The introduction antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) treatment HIV dramatically improve morbidity mortality HIV infect people developed world . However , research data efficacy ART regimens develop country , South Africa , limit . There estimate 4.7 million HIV infected individual South African population 40 million inhabitant . The great social impact may achieve treat entire household affect HIV ensure maximum adherence prescribe ART regimen minimize share antiretroviral drug . This study evaluate effectiveness ART give HIV-trained doctor compare ART give HIV-trained primary health care nurse . Participants fail first-line therapy receive second-line regimen base medication available clinic , approval clinical safety team . Participants study recruit resource-poor community outside Johannesburg Cape Town , South Africa . This study last 5 year . HIV infected people HIV infect member household 16 year age old enrol . Study participant receive first-line ART consist efavirenz ( EFV ) daily , lamivudine ( 3TC ) twice daily , stavudine ( d4T ) twice daily . Women childbearing potential unwilling use acceptable form contraception CD4 count less 250 cells/mm3 receive 3TC twice daily ; nevirapine ( NVP ) daily 2 week , twice daily ; d4T twice daily . Women pregnant baseline , become pregnant study treatment , unwilling use acceptable method contraception CD4 count 250 cells/mm3 , child previously expose NVP receive 3TC twice daily , lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) twice daily , d4T twice daily .

Arm 1 receive ART monitoring care HIV-trained medical doctor , Arm 2 receive ART monitoring care HIV-trained primary health care nurse training HIV diagnosis treatment . Participants fail first-line regimen receive second-line regimen remain treatment arm . Study visit occur study entry ; Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 ; every 12 week thereafter .

Participants also ask complete quality life household cost questionnaire select visit . Study visit participant fail first-line treatment occur treatment failure , Days 15 30 , Week 4 post-treatment failure , every 4 week Week 48 post-treatment failure , every 12 week thereafter .
