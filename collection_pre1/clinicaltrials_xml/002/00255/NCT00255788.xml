	<brief_title>Everolimus Treating Patients WIth Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy 2 different treatment schedule everolimus , term clinical/radiological response early progression , patient recurrent metastatic breast cancer . Secondary - Determine time progression response duration patient treat regimen . - Determine toxic effect regimens patient . - Correlate molecular marker mTOR activity tumor tissue objective tumor response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord presence visceral metastasis ( yes v ) prior chemotherapy regimens recurrent disease ( 0 vs 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . - Arm II : Patients receive oral everolimus day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week periodically disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 30 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
