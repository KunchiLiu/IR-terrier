	<brief_title>TMC125-C216 : A Phase III Study Investigate Efficacy , Tolerability Safety TMC125 Part Antiretroviral Regimen , Including TMC114/Ritonavir Investigator-selected Optimized Background , HIV-1 Infected Patients With Limited Treatment Options .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial evaluate long-term efficacy , tolerability , safety TMC125 part antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) regimen contain TMC114/ritonavir ( RTV ) investigator-selected optimize background ( OBR ) treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patient . TMC125 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) . TMC114 protease inhibitor ( PI ) . In trial , TMC114 give low dose ritonavir ( RTV ) , protease inhibitor commonly use , full dose protease inhibitor improve activity . Additional assessment evaluate trial include : change HIV-1 genotype , drug susceptibility , population pharmacokinetics TMC125 . A pharmacokinetic substudy perform select site . Health-related quality life assess patient receive antiretroviral therapy contain either TMC125 placebo . Safety tolerability document throughout trial . Six hundred HIV-1 infected patient stable virologically fail regimen include trial . Patients least 1 documented non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) resistance-associated mutation ( either screen historical genotype report ) , HIV-1 plasma viral load &gt; 5000 RNA copies/mL screening , least 3 documented primary protease inhibitor ( PI ) mutation . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio either TMC125 ( 200 mg twice daily ) match placebo ; combination TMC114/RTV ( 600/100 mg twice daily ) investigator select OBR least 2 antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) , consist nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( ) ( NRTI [ ] ) without enfuvirtide . The trial involve screen period 6 week , 48-week treatment period , 4 week follow-up period . Patients take 200 mg oral dos TMC125 tablet placebo tablet , twice daily ( administered 2 tablet twice daily , food ) combination 600 mg oral dos TMC114 tablets 100 mg oral dos ritonavir ( administer 2 tablet TMC114 1 capsule ritonavir twice daily , food ) . The treatment period 48 week .</detailed_description>
