	<detailed_description>Policosanol , compound derive sugar cane wax available health food store across United States , popular non-prescription product treat hypercholesterolemia . Policosanol use Cuba since 1991 treat high cholesterol . Virtually publish medical literature policosanol author research group Cuba . According Cuban data , policosanol low total cholesterol , low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) . Based post-marketing survey , drug appear devoid biochemical , hematological , clinical adverse effect . Confirmation data policosanol scientifically rigorous experiment trial country would provide safe effective therapeutic option treatment hypercholesterolemia . Consequently , policosanol potential become valuable tool fight coronary heart disease – major cause mortality United States . This pilot study ass short-term safety efficacy policosanol healthy adult baseline LDL-C 130-200 . The recruitment population derive primary care clinic consist primarily Caucasian African-American patient . The primary outcome measurement percentage change LDL-C . Secondary outcome include change total cholesterol , HDL-C , triglyceride , C-reactive protein , lipoprotein sub-particles . This first know randomized clinical trial policosanol North America . The data derive pilot study regard lipid lower effect policosanol use support application funding institution outside Carolinas Healthcare System include National Institute Health ( NIH ) . Future study could include assessment effect policosanol marker coronary heart disease potential use combination current lipid medication . The overall goal perform large multi-center clinical outcome trial establish precise clinical benefit policosanol . Summary : Demonstration lipid-lowering ability policosanol initial step provide safe , cost-effective therapy hypercholesterolemia , thereby advance treatment prevention cardiovascular disease country . Specific Aim : To independently corroborate lipid lower effect policosanol small pilot study . Hypotheses : After 8 week therapy policosanol 40 mg/day : 1 . Produce statistically significant reduction LDL-C compare placebo . 2 . Provide statistically significant reduction LDL particle number C-reactive protein .</detailed_description>
