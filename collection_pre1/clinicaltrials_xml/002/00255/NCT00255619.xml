	<brief_summary>Apart haemodialysis , continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) another effective therapy end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . The Achilles heel CAPD however peritonitis , major cause morbidity mortality CAPD patient . Advances connectology , disconnect system , result reduced rate peritonitis . The disconnect system incorporate Y-connection allow contamination occur time connection system flush drainage bag thereby reduce size microorganism innoculum enter peritoneal cavity . In recent year , twin bag system infusion drainage bag pre-attached Y tubing , result reduction peritonitis rate . Two different twin bag system introduce MOH hospital . They Baxter UltraBag® Fresenius Andy·Disc® . Even though system similar , experience suggest minor variation connectology could translate marked difference peritonitis rate . In multi centre , randomise control study , twin bag system evaluate establish equivalence respect incidence peritonitis technique failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label Trial Establish Equivalence Between ANDY-Disc® Ultrabag® Patients CAPD .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-centre , open label , parallel group randomize trial design demonstrate therapeutic equivalence ANDY-Disc® Ultrabag® treatment period 12 month . 270 patient CAPD 6 participate site meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol trial . After initial screening , patient attend clinic baseline examination , include clearance study . Subjects randomly allocate ANDY-Disc® Ultrabag® ratio 1:1 . Study visit occur every 2 week 4 week , every 4 week 12 week , every 12 week thereafter duration study ( 12 month ) . Hence total 7 visit ( 1 screen/baseline , 2 biweekly , 2-4 weekly 2-6 monthly treatment visit , last final visit ) . Safety tolerability assessment consist monitor adverse event serious adverse event , monitor haematology , blood chemistry regular performance physical examination . Criteria evaluation : Efficacy : Primary efficacy parameter : The primary efficacy variable incidence peritonitis . Peritonitis define presence least two follow 1 . Abdominal pain tenderness 2 . Presence white blood cell peritoneal effluent excess 100 cell per mL compose least 50 % polymorph 3 . Positive cultureSecondary efficacy parameter : The secondary efficacy variable : 1 . Technique failure ; define transfer haemodialysis death . Note cross-over comparator treatment consider withdrawal . Frequency technical problem product defect , satisfaction difficulty use connection system . Technical problem product defect shall observe evaluated patient data record use patient ’ diary . Satisfaction difficulty use connection system evaluate investigator global fashion questionnaire . Safety : Safety tolerability assessment consist 1 . Monitoring record adverse event serious adverse event . 2 . Regular performance physical examination , include vital sign . 3 . Regular monitoring haematology blood chemistry parameter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent obtain patient parents/guardian . 2 . New exist patient ( single bag system ) end stage renal failure MOH CAPD programme indication use twin bag system . For purpose trial , indication : All paediatric patient ( age 18 year ) Patients could train use single bag system Existing CAPD patient single bag system recurrent peritonitis Existing CAPD patient single bag system various reason could longer continue system . Existing CAPD patient single bag system opinion investigator would benefit switch twin bag system . 1 . Participation CAPD trial patient receive investigational product within 30 day precede screen phase study . 2 . Those person directly involve conduct study . 3 . History noncompliance medical regimen patient unwilling unable comply protocol . 4 . Any serious medical condition disability , opinion investigator , would interfere treatment assessment preclude completion study . 5 . Patients expect transferred non participate centre within next six month 6 . Patients presently twin bag system 7 . Use automated cycler assistance</criteria>
