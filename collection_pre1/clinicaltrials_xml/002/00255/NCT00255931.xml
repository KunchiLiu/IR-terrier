	<brief_title>Impact Psychological Biofeedback-Relaxation Intervention Clinical , Physical Psychological Outcomes Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term aim program research improve physical psychological health outcome adults heart failure ( HF ) . The specific aim randomize , control clinical trial test effect biofeedback-relaxation therapy HF patient rehospitalizations , cardiac mortality quality life , secondary end-points perceive control , anxiety , depression , skin temperature , plasma norepinephrine level , heart rate variability ( HRV ) . In 1990s , HF emerge significant public health threat reach epidemic proportion . Heart failure incidence prevalence expect increase worldwide , impact worsen dramatically . Individuals HF suffer incapacitate physical symptom , emotional distress , impaired quality life , repeat rehospitalizations , premature death . To combat rise HF epidemic , crucial researcher study new strategy improve outcomes . Despite potential effective partner drug therapy , role nonpharmacologic intervention HF management receive relatively little attention . One may argue drug therapy effective enough resource need expend research nonpharmacologic therapy . However , three point argue stance . First , despite substantial advance make HF treatment drug therapy , morbidity mortality remain unacceptably high . As Kannel state , `` innovation treatment ... HF thus far make disappointingly small improvement itsâ€¦outlook '' . Second , although drug therapy frequently provide significant improvement symptom functional ability , quality life may improve . This outcome important patient HF poor quality life independently predict morbidity mortality . Third , nonpharmacologic strategy effect size important HF outcome ( e.g. , rehospitalization rates/mortality quality life ) similar see drug therapy . Recent study demonstrate therapy substantially improve outcome beyond level see patient pharmacologic therapy . Biofeedback-relaxation therapy innovative promising nonpharmacologic strategy . An optimally effective treatment beneficial effect pathophysiological psychological manifestation target condition . This goal especially important condition like HF , profoundly negative impact physical psychological function . Hallmark pathophysiology HF include intense neurohumoral activation , initiate sustain sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) , mark vasoconstriction . Adverse psychological manifestation chronic HF include feeling loss control , anxiety depression . Both neurohumoral activation psychological consequence HF contribute poor quality life , frequent HF hospitalization , increase mortality . As show model Figure 1 , biofeedback-relaxation therapy take three complementary , separate pathway improve outcomes . This biobehavioral therapy decrease SNS activation ( reflect HRV plasma norepinephrine ) , produce stress reduction ( reflect change perceive control , anxiety depression ) , result vasodilation ( reflect skin temperature ) . Biofeedback-relaxation therapy powerful influence separate , yet complementary effect . For example , SNS activation directly decrease biofeedback-relaxation therapy , also indirectly result stress reduction increase control , decrease anxiety depression . As result physical psychological effect , biofeedback-relaxation could clinically meaningful impact rehospitalizations , survival quality life . For reason , biofeedback-relaxation may effective adjunct pharmacologic therapy management HF . Thus , purpose propose research examine impact biofeedback-relaxation training HF patient outcome .</detailed_description>
