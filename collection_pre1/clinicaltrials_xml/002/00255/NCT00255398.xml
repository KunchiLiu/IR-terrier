	<brief_summary>Kidney Disease Biomarkers Summary : This study identify biomarkers ( protein molecule blood urine ) may help scientist predict kidney disease patient whether give patient would respond particular therapy . The study look biomarkers blood urine patient various kidney disease study effect angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACE inhibitor ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) biomarkers . Blood urine healthy volunteer study comparison . Healthy people follow patient may eligible study : adult diabetic nephropathy 18 year age old ; child newly diagnose clinical idiopathic nephrotic syndrome 2 18 year age ; child adult glomerular disease ( minimal change disease , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , collapse glomerulopathy ) . Participants undergo test procedure follow : Glomerular Disease : Adults glomerular disease provide four six blood urine sample course 6 12 month . The sample collect time regularly schedule visit NIH treatment protocol participate . Children provide blood sample . Chronic Kidney Disease : Patients chronic kidney disease provide blood urine sample every 6 month 3 year . Angiotensin Antagonism : Patients chronic kidney disease take ACE inhibitor ARBs stop medicine 4 week , take ACE inhibitor ARBs begin one medicine . In general , patient start medication continue study complete , since beneficial chronic kidney disease . - Medication withdrawal group : Patients come NIH 2 successive day begin study blood urine test ( include one 24-hour urine collection ) receive iothalamate ( chemical use measure kidney function ) . Iothalamate deliver 24 hour needle place abdomen ( elsewhere ) via pump similar pump diabetic use deliver insulin . Patients stop take ACE inhibitor ARB medication . They monitor blood pressure every day return NIH 1 , 2 4 week blood test . During week 4 , iothalamate infusion repeat , blood urine sample collect begin study . Patients resume take ACE inhibitor ARB day dose increase 2-week interval . They come NIH weekly 1 week every week blood test . Four week reach high FDA-recommended dose medication tolerate , iothalamate infusion blood urine collection repeat . - Medication induction group : At begin study , patient iothalamate infusion blood urine collection describe begin take either ACE inhibitor ARB . The dose increase 2 week . Patients monitor blood pressure every day . After high dose 4 week , patient repeat iothalamate infusion blood urine collection . The study complete provide 2-month supply medicine take home . Information gather symptom , treatment , result past laboratory test patient . Healthy volunteer provide blood urine sample collection every month every month four collection use biomarker study screen common chronic disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There press need develop biomarkers renal disease , might assist diagnosis prognosis might provide endpoint clinical trial drug design slow progression renal insufficiency . We propose study potential biomarkers five population . First , study remittive therapy glomerular disease ( sample size 40 ) , enrol child idiopathic nephrotic syndrome ( N=20 ) adult minimal change , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , collapse glomerulopathy ( N=20 ) . We collect periodic urine sample patient receive remittive therapy glucocorticoid agent . We also study 10 healthy adult volunteer . We carry targeted urine proteomic study , measure level glomerular cell marker cytokine , profile urine protein use mass spectrometry . Our goal identify marker particular disease entity steroid responsiveness explore whether biomarkers contribute histologic sub-classification disease . Second , study 40 adult progressive chronic kidney disease various etiology glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 . We study blood urine sample , use target profiling approach . Our goal identify biomarkers correlate progressive loss glomerular filtration function , functional correlate progressive renal fibrosis . Third , study 40 adult , primarily diabetic nephropathy , start stop angiotensin antagonist therapy ( angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ) compare urine proteomic profile therapy therapy ( 4 week interval ) . Our goal identify potential biomarkers correlate beneficial anti-fibrotic effect agent . Fourth , wish define possible sex difference urine exosome protein , obtain healthy volunteer , hospitalize six day administration standard diet collection research urine sample . Fifth , wish determine whether salt intake influence urine exosome protein , obtain healthy volunteer . These subject hospitalize 12 day time place sequentially high salt diet low salt diet , collection research urine sample blood pressure monitoring . Proteomic analysis study take several approach , include mass spectrometry urinary peptide , analysis urinary exosomes , immunologic detection quantification candidate protein urine blood .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Children newly diagnose clinical idiopathic nephrotic syndrome age 218 year . 2 . Children previously diagnose clinical idiopathic nephrotic syndrome age 218 year time diagnosis sustain relapse nephrotic syndrome steroid therapy . A relapse define urine protein level 2+ ( 100mg/dl ) great first morning urine sample 3 consecutive day . While quantitative urine protein/creatinine ratio precise , semiquantitative definition accord pediatric practice . Relapses treat accord standard clinical practice . 3 . Children adults participate NIH trial remittive therapy MCD/FSGS/CG ( e.g . Podocyte dexamethasone Retinoids podocyte disease ) eligible . 4 . Also , study 10 healthy adult volunteer . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . IN CHILDREN , ANY OF THE FOLLOWING 1 . Age le 2 year . The rationale exclude child age 2 yr nephrotic syndrome unusual age group may etiologies MCD FSGS 2 . Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic diastolic great 95 % population mean child age sex , receive therapy ) , azotemia ( serum creatinine great 1.5mg/dL ) , gross hematuria time presentation ( clinical marker primary secondary GN ) . 3 . Hypocomplementemia , positive ANA , antiDS DNA , ASO , antiDNase B , MPO , PR3 , Hepatitis B C HIV serology . 2 . In child adult : 1 . Clinical contraindication steroid therapy . 2 . The presence medical condition might interfere interpretation result , cancer , diabetes , long history hypertension . 3 . Healthy adult volunteer : 1. age great 18 yr ; history hypertension , diabetes , chronic illness might complicate interpretation result ; take prescription medication . CKD PROGRESSION STUDY : INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Renal biopsy diagnosis glomerular disease interstitial nephritis clinical diagnosis diabetic nephropathy . 2 . Mild moderate renal insufficiency , define eGFR less 60 ml/min/1.73m ( 2 ) great 30 ml/min/1.73m ( 2 ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 ) The presence medical condition might interfere interpretation result , cancer . ANGIOTENSIN ANTAGONISM STUDY : INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Adults great 18 year old . Few child diabetic nephropathy frequent blood draw would problematic child . 2 . Type 1 Type 2 diabetes . Later study expand glomerular disease . 3 . Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio great 30 mg/g .
