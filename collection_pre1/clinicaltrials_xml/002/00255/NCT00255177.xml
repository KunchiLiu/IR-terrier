	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infect approximately 170 million people worldwide . The current standard- of- care therapy chronic HCV infection regimen subcutaneously administer ( pegylated ) -interferon-α ribavirin 24 week ( genotype 2 3 ) 48 week ( genotype 1 ) . The sustained viral response rate ( SVR ) patient infect genotype 2 3 ~80 % remain &lt; 50 % patient infect genotype 1 . The treatment quite toxic approximately 30 % patient experience adverse event ( i.e . depression , fever , anemia , fatigue ) require dose reduction discontinuation therapy . This regimen contraindicate woman pregnant patient decompensated liver disease . The absence acceptable therapy many patient HCV infection make new therapy desirable disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The 341-nucleotide 5 ' non-translated region conserve part hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) genome . It contain highly structure internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) mediate cap-independent initiation translation viral polyprotein mechanism unprecedented eukaryote . The first step translation initiation assembly eukaryotic initiation factor ( eIF ) 3 , eIF2 , GTP , initiator tRNA 40S ribosomal subunit 43S preinitiation complex ( 1 , 2 ) . The IRES contain site bind independently eIF3 40S ribosomal subunit component 43S complex , structural determinant ensure correct spatial orientation bind site 48S complex assembles precisely initiation codon . Since inhibit early translation viral protein block HCV replication downstream , early critical step replication great interest drug target . All genotype HCV use pathway ; drug target effective HCV genotype . VGX-410 represent first drug novel class HCV IRES inhibitor development . VGX-410 orally active bioavailable , small-molecule , organic drug . Because related formulation mifepristone previously approve FDA another indication ( medical abortion ) , pre-existing data animal toxicity test show safety compound high dos ( 5 mg/kg 6 month rat macaque ) . In addition , chronic administration ( 200 mg/day ) compound experimental treatment variety malignant non-malignant condition well tolerate non-HCV-infected subject 1 year ( 3-6 ) . In cell culture test , VGX-410 show effective inhibiting HCV replication 50 % 90 % effective antiviral concentration ( EC50 EC90 ) 2 10 μM , respectively . Furthermore , VGX-410 show act synergistically interferon-a ( IFN-a ) , widely-used drug treatment option available today . When use combination low dose IFN-a 1 IU/ml , EC90 VGX-410 reduce 3 µM . Moreover , since VGX-410 inhibits viral replication block cellular protein complex HCV IRES , reduce potential viral mutation resistance drug . From vitro data , would expect observe 50 90 % anti-HCV effect human serum drug concentration 2 10 μM , respectively . Moreover , compile drug concentration result several previously-reported clinical data level steady-state concentration patient take repeat daily dos mifepristone ( &gt; 4 day ) . For instance , repeat oral administration 100 200-mg mifepristone daily 4 day achieve maximum plasma level 4.5 5.4 μM , respectively ( 9 ) .</detailed_description>
