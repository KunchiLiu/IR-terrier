	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel prednisone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . It yet know schedule docetaxel prednisone effective treat prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study two different schedule docetaxel prednisone compare well work treat patient metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Prednisone Treating Patients With Hormone-Refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare time treatment failure patient hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer treat two different schedule docetaxel combination prednisone . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare response rate patient treat regimen . - Compare safety regimens patient . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare need epoetin beta patient treat regimen . - Determine effect epoetin beta hemoglobin response rate , transfusion rate , quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center WHO performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 15 oral prednisone daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 prednisone daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dL ) receive epoetin beta subcutaneously weekly chemotherapy . Quality life assess baseline , every 6 week study treatment , completion study treatment , every 2 month thereafter . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 360 patient ( 180 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 4 year .</detailed_description>
