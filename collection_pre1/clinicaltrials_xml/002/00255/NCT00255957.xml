	<brief_summary>The use HES find clinically improve patient stroke administer within window period mean hemodilution improve rehology . We propose see effect long term administraion HES amount require treat stroke patient study effect kinetics HES , effect coagulation hemorheology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients stroke benefit hemodilution administer HES window period continue period 10 day . Hemodilution improve hemorheology thus possibly preserve cerebral tissue penumbra region affect vessel . We propose see effect prolong administration HES different make study kinetics , hemorehology coagulation parameter TEG literature kinetics coagulation follwing prolong use stroke patient also study neurological outcome . Patients present Emergency department outpatient department within 24 hrs manifestation symptom recruit study take informed consent language patients/ family understand study personnel identify authorize . The patient randomly allocate receive HES either make 10 day 10 patient group . The randomization random number generation computer . The product blind patient observer black cover label A OR B group . Blood Samples drawn time randomization , 3 , 5 10 day rehological , coagulation effect kinetics HES , store per requirement analyze . Routine biochemical test prescribe physician undertaken require . Satistical analysis data do SPSS .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age 18 70 yrs Clinical diagnosis ischemic stroke No marked spontaneous improvement symptom randomization Written inform consent nearest relative .
