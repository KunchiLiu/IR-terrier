	<brief_summary>Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) commonly identify functional gastrointestinal disorder , affect 10-20 % population Western world , see predominantly female negative impact quality life , characterize recurrent often disable abdominal pain associate altered frequency appearance passage stool . IBS aetiology unknown treatment remain largely empirical direct relief symptom . One possible target IBS treatment identify drug modulate action Cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , peptide gut hormone implicate regulation motor sensory function various level gastrointestinal tract . The biological action CCK gastrointestinal tract mediate CCK1-receptors . Dexloxiglumide oral potent selective antagonist CCK1-receptors . The mechanism dexloxiglumide might beneficial IBS ability modulate visceral hypersensitivity gut dysmotility . The DARWIN study design confirm efficacy dexloxiglumide accord so-called randomized/withdrawal design . In design participant start study treatment improve patient ( `` responder '' ) randomize active treatment placebo , expect frequent and/or rapid relapse symptom patient randomise placebo active . Female male patient , age 18-70 yr meeting IBS diagnostic criterion whose main complain constipation , disease least moderate severity , receive dexloxiglumide placebo double-blind treatment phase 24 week , follow first treatment 12 wks patient qualify `` responder '' study treatment . The responder status patient 4-wk assessment period , base weekly global patient-based assessment relief control symptom use telephone/internet-based diary . Additional secondary efficacy parameter include : effect treatment IBS cardinal symptom ( e.g . abdominal discomfort/pain , bloating , strain , incomplete evacuation , urgency , stool frequency consistency ) , rescue laxative consumption , quality life . Standard safety parameter include vital sign , adverse event reporting , physical examination , routine laboratory screen , 12-lead ECG gallbladder ultrasound .</brief_summary>
