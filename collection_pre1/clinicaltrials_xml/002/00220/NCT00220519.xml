	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : Critical illness therapy accompany associate disruption ecological equilibrium GI tract ultimately lead infection . Lactobacillus GG , probiotic , replete healthy flora intestinal tract may decrease risk diarrhea infection critical illness . However , little known impact probiotic follow burn injury mechanism behind proposed benefit . The hypothesis research Lactobacillus GG decrease incidence diarrhea infection burn child receive antibiotic therapy . The specific aim research determine impact Lactobacillus GG incidence diarrhea infection among burned child ( &gt; 20 % TBSA ) receive antibiotic therapy . Subjects : All subject recruit Shriners Hospitals Children Boston . Patients age admit Shriners Hospitals Children Boston match follow inclusion criterion consider study 1 ) burn wound size least 20 % body surface area , 2 ) require antibiotic therapy . Exclusion criterion include : 1 ) &lt; 20 % total body surface area burn , 2 ) require antibiotic therapy , 3 ) require post-operative antibiotic therapy , 4 ) bowel obstruction , 5 ) milk allergy . Study Design : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . Patients randomly assign receive Lactobacillus GG ( n = 47 ) placebo ( n = 47 ) within 3 day initiation antibiotic therapy . Randomization occur use computerized randomization list . A pharmacist , member study staff , assign 2 supplement group number label supplement bottle accordingly . Methods : Lactobacillus GG , nonpathogenic microorganism , administer study . A dose 1010 colony factor unit ( cfu ) twice daily give experimental group ( n =47 ) . The control group receive placebo ( n = 47 ) identical appearance probiotic . All supplement administer orally via feed tube . The study endpoint 10 day antibiotic use discontinue patient discharge Parameters measure include 1 ) occurrence pneumonia infection wound , blood , urine , define The National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System ( A localize systemic condition result adverse reaction presence infectious agent ( ) toxin ( ) ) clarify Infection Control Nurse , 2 ) incidence diarrhea define 3 loose watery stool per 24 hour , 3 ) weekly weight lab ( include total protein , albumin , prealbumin C-reactive protein ) obtain per routine care , 4 ) length antibiotic use , 5 ) length stay .</detailed_description>
