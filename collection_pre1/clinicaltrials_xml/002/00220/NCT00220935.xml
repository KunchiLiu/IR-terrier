	<brief_summary>Hypothesis – This study design evaluate result use Orthotrac Pneumatic Vest versus EZ form brace patient radiate leg pain disc bulge / protrusion / herniation . Specifically , hypothesis patient give Orthotrac Pneumatic Vest ( OPV ) great pain relief increase self-reported functionality few progression surgery use EZ form brace .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Controlled Trial Treatment Disc Herniation With Radiating Leg Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria : Patient ’ present low back unilateral leg pain potential candidate recruitment study . For purpose research , leg pain constitute symptom extend leg beyond knee . The contralateral side may pain buttock posterior thigh knee . The criterion follow : Inclusion / Exclusion : - Age 21 – 55 - Preferred prior surgery spine surgery previous 6 month . - No neurological deficit - VAS &gt; 4.0 - Symptoms unresolved 4 week - Minimal antalgic lean trunk initially weight bear - Pain aggravate weight bearing stand / walk - Reduced leg pain recumbency - MRI Confirmed disc bulge / protrusion / herniation ( HNP ) site consistent symptom – prefer . Patient Recruitment : A total 150 subject , 75 per group , seek study . The best time capture list potential patient inception diagnosis treatment . The TBI practice equip electronic scheduling , medical record billing system . This pose significant advantage patient recruitment project . On daily basis , project coordinator/patient recruiter ( PC/PR ) access daily schedule new patient enter system 17 TBI physician . This cross-correlated later exit diagnosis leg pain ensure maximum capture potential candidate . Upon obtain permission solicit patient , project explain sign informed consent obtain patient agree participate . Non-participants solicited signature permit u monitor progress course treatment administer outcome questionnaire . Those sign consent participate consent monitor continue care purge project record . Patient Randomization Blinding Analysis : At inception project prior begin patient recruitment , assignments 180 participant block randomized obtain equal number treatment group ; Orthotrac ( OPV ) EZ form brace ( EZF ) . An additional 30 randomization study sample size 150 complete allow 10 % drop-out rate group case patient voluntary withdrawal participation . Random assignment seal sequentially numbered envelope keep lock office surgeon co-investigator . Upon patient signing inform consent participate , project coordinator ( PC / PR ) obtain next consecutive seal randomization envelope , assign patient random group deliver group assignment identification principal investigator ( PI ) warehouse recruitment data . The patient scheduled PC obtain appropriate demographic information administer outcome measure . Measures obtain time recruitment ever possible . Results outcome measure seal envelope , unscored , delivered surgeon co-investigator warehousing later analysis . In order maintain blind PC / PR , measure patient fit him/her device initial visit . The PI proper device order accord randomization check fit delivery . Experimental Maneuver Patients qualify study persistent leg pain attribute lumbar HNP typical medical / chiropractic care . At stage entry project , question surgical intervention may realistic alternative . The experimental maneuver contrast ability OPV v EZF improve symptom function . Patients assign OPV group measure PC / PR fit device . They receive instruction use QID minimum 30 minute . Patients assign EZF orthotic fit device instruct wear weight bearing hour . Patient Assessment Outcome Measures : At inception patient project , either participant non-participant , baseline assessment perform PC . Reassessment complete 6 , 12 , 26 52 week . The PC monitor patient status compliance typical treatment weekly basis computerize schedule medical record . Telephone contact make biweekly basis evaluate self-reported compliance wear determine intervene health care service utilization medication use use standardized phone interview method Assessment measure include follow : 1 . Inception baseline : a. Demographic b . Diagnostic c. Pre-episode work status d. Rang Motion ( ROM ) i. Flexion / Extension ii . Straight leg raise e. Pain evaluation . Pain level ( Visual analogue scale ) ii . Quantitative pain draw iii . Medication use f. Functional evaluation i. Oswestry Back Disability index ii . SF – 36 2 . Follow-up evaluation : 1 . Work status 2 . Rang Motion ( ROM ) i. Flexion / Extension ii . Straight leg raise c. Pain evaluation . Pain level ( Visual analogue scale ) ii . Quantitative pain draw iii . Medication use d. Functional evaluation i. Oswestry Back Disability index ii . SF – 36 3 . Bi-weekly telephone contact 1 . Work status 2 . Medication use 3 . Wear compliance 4 . Other health care utilization 5 . TBI treatment session ( PT , DC , MD , injection , surgical scheduling ) Primary outcome project quantitative pain level , use VAS . Monitoring medication use expect support outcome . Further primary outcome center functionality score focus Oswestry SF 36 . The SF36 result expect useful adjunct assessment patient low back pain combine disease-specific questionnaire ( 3 ) . All measure use descriptively explanatory variable .</detailed_description>
