	<brief_title>Safety Study Combination Chemotherapy Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors Adenocarcinoma Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer major health problem United States develop nation . Approximately thirty thousand case adenocarcinoma exocrine pancreas diagnose United States year . The majority tumor unresectable time diagnosis . Unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer often resistant treatment response rate less 10 % median survival time less six month associate single agent chemotherapy . As July 2003 , gemcitabine remain standard care palliative chemotherapy patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer . This drug modest clinical activity . In phase III randomize control trial , 126 patient advanced symptomatic pancreatic cancer randomize receive either gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly x 7 follow week rest weekly x 3 every 4 week thereafter fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 weekly . The primary endpoint score clinical benefit response ( CBR ) derive composite pain , performance status , weight . CBR experience 24 % gemcitabine treat patient compare 5 % 5-FU treated patient . The median survival duration 5.65 4.41 month gemcitabine-treated 5-FU-treated patient , respectively . The one year survival 18 % patient treat gemcitabine compare 2 % patient treat 5-FU . The effectiveness gemcitabine may improve alter standard infusion schedule fix dose rate . Gemcitabine require intracellular phosphorylation form active di- triphosphates , dose rate dependent . A phase II trial randomize patient either receive gemcitabine 2200 mg/m2 standard 30 minute infusion gemcitabine 1500 mg/m2 fix rate 10 mg/m2/min weekly x 3 every 4 week . The fixed rate infusion 10 mg/m2/min associate high response rate 16.6 % v 2.7 % , long median survival 6.1 v 4.7 month , high percentage patient survive one year , 23 % v 0 % . The fixed rate infusion schedule also associate significantly high median gemcitabine triphosphate level peripheral circulate mononuclear cell infusion .</detailed_description>
