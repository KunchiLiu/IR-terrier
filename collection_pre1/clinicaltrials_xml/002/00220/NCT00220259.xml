	<brief_summary>The overall aim study find whether take regular inhaled steroid ( eg Pulmicort , Flixotide , Becotide , Becloforte ) good lung child adult cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Some patient put inhaled steroid wheezy despite take regular bronchodilator ( inhale medicine help open airway eg Ventolin , Bricanyl ) . Occasionally young child put wheeze cold , simply remain ever since . However many CF patient put onto inhaled steroid doctor think might reduce inflammation lung help improve lung function . This inflammation ( swell line airway ) know important CF result recurrent chest infection . Although believe , theory , inhaled steroid useful CF patient , sure well work CF yet possible prove standard study . This would normally involve start inhaled steroid patient take . We therefore take different approach , namely withdraw patient long time , see effect stop . It important answer question , want CF patient take medicine may unnecessary . CF patient already take many oral inhale medicine cut burden , would helpful everyone . Of course , may find patient need medicine least certain good reason . The main hypothesis withdraw inhaled steroid associate earlier onset acute chest exacerbation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cystic Fibrosis Withdrawal Inhaled Steroids Evaluation Study ( CF WISE Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Long term , often high dose , inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) increasingly prescribed patient CF combat lung inflammation . Despite five published study , Cochrane systematic review conclude enough evidence either benefit harm . The number CF patient already take ICS UK mean recruitment conventional study prove difficult . Aims : test feasibility safety withdrawal ICS CF perform study randomise placebo-controlled withdrawal ICS child adult already take . The result use determine feasibility future prospective study prove whether start ICS CF patient already , successfully withdraw , lead benefit ( lung function chest exacerbation ) and/or harm , compare placebo . Methods : We study 240 child adult 12 centre . We match placebo Flixotide meter dose inhaler use Volumatic , subject currently Pulmicort Becotide switch Flixotide 2 month run-in phase , subject use ICS spacer device . Patients randomise continue ICS take placebo 6 month , double-blind fashion . Primary outcome time 1st exacerbation ; secondary one decline lung function , new course antibiotic rescue bronchodilator usage .</detailed_description>
