	<brief_summary>Fragile X syndrome common know inherited cause neurodevelopmental disability . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study laboratory indicate specific brain region use neurochemical , acetylcholine , show significantly reduce activation learning . Since donepezil medication enhances acetylcholine function brain , purpose study determine donepezil beneficial effect behavior cognition subject fragile X syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Trial Donepezil Fragile X Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fragile X syndrome common genetically inherit cause neurodevelopmental disability human , affect approximately 1:2000 4000 live birth . Affected individual significant , long-term problem learn , often behavior well . The disorder cause presence greatly expand CGG repeat within FMR1 gene long arm X chromosome . Abnormal methylation repeat , adjacent area within FMR1 gene impedes transcription , ultimately result reduce production FMR1 protein ( FMRP ) . This protein express neuron , particularly high level gene transcription occur nucleus basalis ( basal forebrain ) hippocampus . A recent functional imaging study group show girl fragile X greatly reduce level brain activation basal forebrain hippocampal activation memory task . The nucleus basalis , cholinergic nucleus widespread connection neocortex . It critical visuospatial attention rodent primates presumed play similar role human . The finding decrease basal forebrain activation girl fragile X , consider light histological evidence show high transcription level FMR1 healthy nucleus basalis , suggest possibility functional cholinergic deficit fragile X syndrome . Donepezil acetylcholinesterase inhibitor slow degradation synaptic acetylcholine thereby increase availability . It approve treatment mild-moderate Alzheimer 's disease . It study several neurologic disorder -- include vascular dementia , Lewy Body dementia , Down 's syndrome ( without dementia ) -- show vary degree efficacy consistently high degree safety tolerability . The goal propose study determine enhance cholinergic activity donepezil beneficial effect behavior cognition subject fragile X syndrome .</detailed_description>
