	<brief_summary>The primary aim study compare effect two blood glucose target 90 day all-cause mortality Intensive Care patient predict admission stay ICU least one full calendar day . The hypothesis little difference relative risk death patient assign glucose range 4.5 - 6.0 mmol/L , assign glucose range less 10.0 mmol/L insulin infuse blood glucose exceed 10.0 mmol/L , adjust need maintain blood glucose 8.0 - 10.0 mmol/L .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NICE-SUGAR study multi-centre , open label , randomise control trial blood glucose management intensive insulin regimen maintain blood glucose 4.5 - 6.0 mmol/L versus insulin regimen maintain blood glucose le 10.0 mmol/L insulin infuse blood glucose exceed 10.0 mmol/L , adjust need maintain blood glucose 8.0 - 10.0 mmol/L . To ensure patient safety , target blood glucose concentration must closely monitored result know clinical staff treat patient . As patient safety paramount , possible blind clinical staff treatment allocation . In open-label trial , bias minimise ensure concealment treatment allocation prior randomisation . The unblinded design risk introduce systematic difference treatment two group , unlikely ICU set many intervention administer simultaneously . The primary outcome measure mortality therefore subject ascertainment bias . Patient recruitment The treatment effect Van den Berghe 's study limit patient stay Intensive Care five day longer , ventilate patient admit study time ICU admission . Identifying patient stay ICU five day longer problematic whereas relatively easy identify patient , particularly patient admit routine post-operative monitoring , discharge alive ICU day follow admission . For reason propose consider patient exclude expect discharged alive dead end day follow admission . The attend Intensive Care physician make assessment . In addition essential patient stay ICU great eligible criterion time frame low risk death exclude . For reason exclude patient able eat ( tube feed due pre-existing bulbar laryngeal dysfunction ) patient merit arterial line part normal management . Patients moribund imminent risk death ( brain death cardiac standstill ) exclude . This exclusion basis treatment allocation alter patient 's outcome . Sample size power calculation The ANZICS adult patient database contain information mortality patient stay 48 hour ICUs . In financial year 2000 , 2001 2002 , 43,760 patient treat intensive care great 48 hour complete data available , 9476 die prior hospital discharge . The hospital mortality rate 22 % . As exclude le sick patient stay great 48 hour 90-day mortality primary outcome measure , study assume 90-day mortality rate 26 % control group . A total 6100 patient recruit , approximately 5100 patient recruit ANZICS CTG centre approximately 1000 patient recruit Canada . The George Institute International Health take responsibility web-based randomisation . This available 24 hour day . A minimisation program stratify treatment allocation type critical illness ( medical vs. surgical ) country . Randomisation achieve via password protect fully secure study website . Study treatment In low range group , continuous infusion insulin administer syringe pump commence blood glucose concentration exceed 6.0 mmol/L infusion rate adjust maintain blood glucose concentration 4.5 - 6.0 mmol/L . In high range group , continuous infusion insulin administer syringe pump start blood glucose concentration exceed 10.0 mmol/L infusion rate adjust keep blood glucose concentration le 10.0 mmol/L titrate need maintain blood glucose concentration 8 - 10 mmol/L . Adjustments insulin dose make base initially measurement whole blood glucose undiluted arterial blood perform initially hourly interval . Sampling arterial blood require presence intra-arterial catheter situ routine clinical management time enrolment . The frequency blood glucose measurement may reduce two-hourly four hourly insulin regimen , blood glucose concentration calorie intake sufficiently stable . Clinical staff ( doctor nurse ) study ICUs undergo formal training familiarisation insulin regimens local study coordinator assist staff appropriate national study coordinate centre . Subsequently administration insulin adjust intensive care doctor nurse use study algorithm access via secure , password protect , encrypt study website . The study algorithm recommends insulin infusion rate whilst allow clinician discretion , ultimate responsibility safe effective use insulin infusion remain treat clinician Patients discharge ICU receive conventional blood glucose management subsequent discharge . Reducing Incidence Hypoglycaemia A major focus research coordinator principal investigator educate staff safe use insulin regimen study . All episodes biochemical hypoglycaemia consider serious adverse event report coordinate centre within 24 hour . These data also report independent data safety monitoring committee . If apparent unacceptable incidence hypoglycaemia , either study overall particular centre centre , study committee take appropriate step reduce incidence . Depending timing cause episode , may include alter blood glucose control algorithm , alter nutrition guideline , institute routine IV glucose supplementation , increase education one centre suspend study one centre . Discontinuation randomise treatment Study treatment continue patient eat require supplementary enteral parenteral nutrition , early ICU discharge death 90 day randomisation . If 90-day follow period study treatment cease patient subsequently deteriorate satisfy study entry criterion , study treatment recommence . If time trial treat ICU physician deem patient 's best interest ( example patient suffers significant repeat episode hypoglycaemia ) , discretion treat physician , study treatment withdrawn . Patients withdraw randomise treatment follow accord study follow schedule analyse accord intention treat principle unless legal surrogate specifically request follow cease . Ancillary Treatments Other aspect patient management unaffected study procedure treat clinician free provide whatever care deem appropriate necessary . Outcomes The principal study outcome whether patient alive dead 90 day . This determine research coordinator participate centre . The study monitor verify source documentation monitor visit . As death robust outcome , unintended bias outcome assessment unlikely . Intentional bias would require collusion study monitor research nurse consider unlikely . Given robustness outcome measure , unnecessary establish blind outcome committee . Secondary outcome , also determine period include : - Death ICU , 28 day 90 day - Length ICU stay - Length hospital stay - The need organ support ( inotropes , renal replacement therapy positive pressure ventilation ) - Incidence blood stream infection - Incidence severity hypoglycaemia - In subgroup patient admit diagnosis traumatic brain injury , follow determine long term functional status determine Extended Glasgow Outcome Scores ( GOSE ) collect Day 90 Six month . Analysis result The George Institute conduct statistical analysis . All analysis perform intention-to-treat basis . Baseline outcome variable compare use Students test , Chi square Mann-Whitney U test appropriate . Odds ratio estimate use multiple logistic regression analysis . Survival analysis perform use Kaplan Meier Cox 's proportional hazard regression analysis . An independent statistician conduct two blind interim analysis primary outcome data 2000 4000 patient submit DSMC . Safety Data Monitoring Committee An independent Safety Data Monitoring Committee chair Professor Sir Richard Peto Oxford University , comprise expert clinical trial , biostatistics , intensive care establish . The committee review unblinded data patient characteristic , treatment compliance study outcomes two interim analysis ( availability primary outcome 1500 3500 patient ) , time point committee may deem necessary protect study participant , final analysis . The committee charge inform study management committee time emerge : 1 . Evidence beyond reasonable doubt difference randomise group cause mortality 2 . Evidence likely change practice many clinician already familiar available evidence comparative effect two blood glucose regimen While definition beyond reasonable doubt leave judgement Safety Data Monitoring Committee , committee consider difference total mortality randomise group three standard deviation would normally constitute evidence . While major focus Committee 's brief monitor total mortality , would also provide data serious adverse event would preclude make recommendation base outcomes cause-specific death serious non-fatal adverse event . This study provide reliable evidence comparative effect different target blood glucose concentration patient treat Australasian Canadian intensive care set . This evidence direct relevance decision care critically ill patient admit ICUs Australia New Zealand , Canada rest world . If study confirm treatment effect report Van den Berghe 's study , maintain normoglycaemia would likely become treatment standard worldwide .</detailed_description>
