	<brief_summary>This study evaluate visual improvement patient treat Immune Globulin Intravenous ( Human ) , 10 % Caprylate/Chromatography Purified ( IGIV-C ) placebo Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) occult Choroidal Neovascularization ( CNV ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Immune Globulin Intravenous ( Human ) To Treat Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose trial investigate effect IGIV-C subject suffer AMD occult CNV few treatment option exist patient disease form . This study design randomize , double-blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled prospective trial . Sixty patient , 30 per treatment group , newly diagnose pure occult CNV define angiography diagnostic criterion enrol . If subject one eye affect occult CNV , eye well vision measure visual acuity ( Logarithm Minimum Angle Resolution [ LogMAR ] score ) enter study eye . Patients randomize receive either IGIV-C dose 2 g/kg body weight ( bw ) 5 consecutive day match placebo . Additional 2 study drug treatment course ( IGIV-C match placebo ) administer every 4 week dose 2 g/kg bw give 5 day . Subjects ' visual acuity measure report LogMAR screening , week 0 ( baseline ) , day 5 , week 4 , week 8 week 12 . If anytime study subject 's visual acuity worsen ≥ 2 line ( 0.2 LogMAR score ) , slit lamp examination perform angiogram conduct ; patient would discontinue worsen due reason outside occult CNV disease change pure occult classic mixed form . Subjects evaluate efficacy ( LogMAR score ) endpoint ( week 12 last LogMAR assessment week 8 , subject prematurely discontinue trial ) . At end treatment period ( week 12 ) , patient enter 3 month observation period monthly visual acuity LogMAR score assessment .</detailed_description>
