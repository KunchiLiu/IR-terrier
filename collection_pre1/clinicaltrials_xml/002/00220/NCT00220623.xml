	<detailed_description>Major Depressive Disorder affect approximately 15 % adult population lifetime . Controlled study indicate short-term antidepressive medication psychotherapy produce full remission 46 % patient . Furthermore , 80 % patient continue subsequent recurrence remission first episode , episode increase probability future recurrence . The World Health Organization estimate year 2020 depression second large cause medical disability worldwide . As result , need validate treatment produce remission prevent recurrences upon long-term follow-up . Furthermore , since several treatment type currently widely practice , need demonstrate efficacy cost effectiveness . We propose conduct pilot study determine feasibility provide estimate randomize control study combine antidepressive medication plus one three form psychotherapy common use adult acute episode recurrent major depression . Two treatment interest , Cognitive-behavioural ( CBT ) psychodynamic ( DYN ) psychotherpy , compare Supportive Clinical Management ( SUP-CM ) , serve control . Overall , study compare active psychotherapy control treatment retention-attrition , efficacy produce remission , prevent recurrence 18-months treatment , improve functioning . Secondary aim explore whether putative psychological risk factor depression improve active psychotherapy control condition , determine whether improvement predicts mediate stay well . Finally , develop preliminary estimate cost-effectiveness cost-offset three treatment condition termination 3 year post-treatment follow-up . If either active treatment give estimate superior prevention recurrence residual symptom impairment , estimate use plan subsequent definitive study , include relative cost-effectiveness cost-offset . Adults ( N=30 , 10 per condition ) meeting DSM-IV-TR criterion acute episode major depressive disorder least one prior episode randomize 18-months either ( 1 ) Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) ( 2 ) Psychodynamic psychotherapy ( DYN ) , standard control treatment ( 3 ) Supportive Clinical Management . All patient receive antidepressive medication ( ADM ) , prescribe accord pre-defined protocol similar CANMAT guideline . Once remission achieve , continuation ADM follow guideline three therapy condition . Assessments include LIFE-method code course depressive episode dysthymia , HRSD-17 BDI-2 , role function impulse symptom measure , theoretically base measure cognitive , affective dynamic psychological risk factor , health care cost economic productivity . Patients assess intake six month interval treatment period three year subsequent follow-up , total 54 month patient . The HRSD-17 economic data collect frequently . Intent-to-treat analysis compare active treatment control treatment . If 18-months either two commonly used psychotherapy provide estimate reduce recurrence morbidity compare standard treatment , estimate use design power subsequent complete study include cost-effectiveness cost-offset .</detailed_description>
