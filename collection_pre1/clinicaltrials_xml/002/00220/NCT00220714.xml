	<brief_summary>Many patient recently receive diagnosis schizophrenia ( e.g. , `` first-episode schizophrenia '' ) respond well antipsychotic medication acutely ill. Once stable , research show first-episode patient need remain antipsychotic medication . Follow-up study show stop medication prematurely common cause relapse readmission . It important new way help patient stay stable community order continue rehabilitation recovery process . Over last decade , new antipsychotic medication develop effective few side effect old antipsychotic . The new medicine often call `` atypical '' , available pill capsule long-term treatment . Most recently , one atypical medication - risperidone - become available long-acting injection give every 2 week . The hypothesis study patient recover acute episode go receive long-acting version atypical antipsychotic medication ( long-acting risperidone microspheres ) stay medication longer take atypical medication ( available first-line atypical ) oral ( pill ) form .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview : Before atypicals introduce , old antipsychotic available oral ( pill capsule ) long-acting ( depot ) version . Despite potential advantage depot version , day clinician United States historically limit use long-acting , `` depot '' antipsychotic treatment-resistant , chronic , patient . Therefore , clinician routinely consider start long-acting antipsychotic early course treatment , first-episode schizophrenia . This whole issue less relevant atypical medication come , available oral version long-term treatment . Now one atypical medication ( risperidone ) available use United States , issue appropriate use oral vs. long-acting atypical relevant clinical practice . For first episode patient , two issue suggest route medication delivery important area study . First almost first-episode patient stop medication soon . Second , atypical antipsychotic available long-acting preparation ( long-acting risperidone , option often use right away first episode , little guidance clinician effectiveness long-acting antipsychotic use right away first-episode . Methods : This study compare effectiveness long-acting route medication improve adherence reduce relapse among patient recently diagnose schizophrenia relate psychotic disorder . After patient stabilized atypical antipsychotic receive patient family psychoeducation , consent patient randomize prospective , random-assignment open-label study compare available first-line oral atypical antipsychotic long-acting risperidone maintenance treatment patient recover acute treatment first-episode schizophrenia . This study divide three study phase . Study Phase I acute phase , consent patient would give acute open-label trial oral antipsychotic . Patients respond within maximum 12 week acute therapy invite participate Phase II study . Patients agree Phase II randomize stay oral antipsychotic medication vs. switch long-acting atypical antipsychotic ( long-acting risperidone ) . Patients would follow 12 week determine whether accept recommendation long-acting antipsychotic continue oral antipsychotic . Then patient enter Study Phase III , follow remainder year . We want learn often patient accept doctor 's recommendation long-acting injection , whether person take antipsychotic medication long-acting form well term willingness stay medication , good symptom control few side effect , person doctor recommend medication oral ( pill ) form . Summary : Patients recently diagnose suffer schizophrenia , e.g . `` first-episode '' patient might benefit atypical antipsychotic give long-acting route drug- delivery . However , long-acting antipsychotic therapy routinely consider first-episode patient . Studying acceptance ultimate effectiveness long-acting atypical antipsychotic would helpful understanding help patient stay stable ultimately prevent revolve door pattern , continue , devastate recovery process .</detailed_description>
