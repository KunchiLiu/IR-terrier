	<detailed_description>Methodology : Patient Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria : Patient ’ present non-radicular low back without sclerotomal , refer leg pain fail conservative care 5 month otherwise meet clinical criterion perform diagnostic discography potential candidate recruitment study . The criterion follow : Inclusion / Exclusion : · Age 21 – 55· No prior spine surgery.· No neurological deficit.· VAS &gt; 3.0· The patient refer provocative discogram diagnostic study suspect single level internal disc derangement.· Normal psychometric screening.For healthy control subject criteria follow : · Age 21 – 55· No spinal deformity· No prior spine surgery.· No history disable back leg pain.· No history back pain past 6 month year . Patient Recruitment : A total 80 subject , divide four group ( 20 per group ) , seek study . Group C population healthy control subject compare Group U , unhealthy subject . Group U represent first 20 patient participant refer discogram procedure . Group DP consist separate group 20 patient referred discogram test whose result positive . Group DN consist 20 patient whose discogram result negative . Statistical criterion valid analysis require separate non-overlapping grouping patient maintain accuracy Type 1 error estimate analysis result . A total 80 patient sought analysis sensitivity specificity require minimum number false positive false negative result present subgroup analysis perform . The TBI practice equip electronic scheduling , medical record billing system . This pose significant advantage patient recruitment project . On daily basis , Project Coordinator ( PC ) access daily schedule patient enter system 17 TBI physician . This cross-correlated later exit diagnosis diagnostic order ensure maximum capture potential candidates.The attend physician ’ medical assistant , notify need discogram , contact PC . The PC review chart confer attend provider confirm entrance requirement . The patient ask permission contact PC solicit participation project . Upon obtain permission , PC contact patient explain project sign informed consent obtain agree participate . Those sign consent participate consent monitor continue care purge project record . Patients schedule CERSR evaluation prior performance diagnostic procedure . The PC perform CERSR test designate appointment provide Principal Investigator ( PI ) test result interpretation without identification diagnostic procedure group assignment patient . To ensure blind PI , demographic field usually maintain CERSR software leave blank exception patient identifier . Separate record maintain PC respect information well report finding discogram may appropriates.The surgeon co-investigator review discogram result patient partition positive negative result base morphologic pain concordance criterion . Testing continue full block 20 subject group obtain . The PC also solicit healthy subject TBI Presbyterian Hospital staff number several hundred total . All healthy volunteer compensate $ 50.00 time inconvenience participation CERSR test . Psychometric Screening : Psychometric screen participant ( healthy patient ) perform use SCL90-R . This instrument use successfully year strong psychometric screen tool incorporates evaluation somatization . Our consult psychologist , Dr. Block , whose sole practice 15 year evaluation treatment spine pain patient , perform score SCL90-R . Subjects whose score high somatization scale alone whose total score suggestive strong psychosocial component included.CERSR Evaluation Interpretation : The CERSR evaluation consist standardized test upright standing , flexion weight bearing . Interpretation similarly follow proscribed method consider maximum RMS , uniformity , centrality , organization location describe Appendix I . Outcome analysis classification patient disc , healthy other.. Interpreter blinding : The PI perform interpretation CERSR test without knowledge patient ’ group membership . The surgeon co-investigator ass discogram result without knowledge CERSR test result . At end study , PI interpretation join database subject status patient outcome diagnostic testing , appropriate . Analysis perform patient group accord group status ( C , U , DP , DN ) .Interpretation Diagnostic Testing : A positive discogram determine follow Dallas protocol abnormal morphology within inner disc reproduction exact pain similar pain disc pressurization.AnalysisAnalysis 1 : Healthy ( n=20 ) Unhealthy ( n=20 ) Abormal CERSR False Positive Positive Normal CERSR Negative False Negative Analysis 2 : Disco Positive ( n = 20 ) Disco Negative ( n = 20 ) Abnormal CERSR Positive False Positive Normal CERSR False Negative Negative Using proprietary CERSR method analysis ( max RMS , uniformity , centrality , organization ) classify patient healthy , disc . Sensitivity , specificity predictive value calculate patient healthy versus positive negative CERSR test . This analysis establish minimum boundary CERSR technology ability differentiate normal unhealthy subject well establish generalizability interpretation hand investigative group . A healthy subject whose CERSR test identify characteristic unhealthy patient classify false positive . Patients suspect discogenic pain fail classify myoelectric pattern unhealthy identify false negative test . The second analysis examine sensitivity , specificity predictive value differentiate discogenic pain generator non-discogenic pain generator . Patients positive CERSR test disc pattern pain classified discogram negative consider false positive . Patients negative CERSR test classify discogram positive discogenic pain consider false negative . This test distinguish accuracy pattern separate discogenic pain nondiscogenic source .</detailed_description>
