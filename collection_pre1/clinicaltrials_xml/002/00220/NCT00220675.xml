	<brief_title>Erythropoietin Spinal Cord Compression Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient malignant spinal cord compression ( MSCC ) paraparetic paraplegic initiate treatment , current treatment option provide meager poor chance neurologic recovery prognosis guard . Improving chance ambulation treatment MSCC may dramatically improve patient ' quality life , decrease day spend hospital improve survival . Steroids appear prevent neurologic damage MSCC increase dos appear increasingly protective effect , however , high dos limit increase incidence serious toxicity . Recombinant human erythropoetin show improve quality life patient anemia chronic disease animal model suggest r-HuEPO may neuroprotective effect . Human study demonstrate increased CSF concentration r-HuEPO intravenous administration , include patient MESCC . Furthermore , suggestion patient treat intravenous r-HuEPO , steroid RT may recover ambulatory function great degree fast patient treat r-HuEPO . Ultimately effect r-HuEPO improving neurologic , functional quality life outcome need test properly design , large , randomize control trial . However , order successfully complete study timely manner , multicenter study need perform . There logistical issue need addressed set r-HuEPO infusion program . Therefore , multicenter , randomize phase 2 study intravenous r-HuEPO , steroid RT allow investigator address three issue : ) confirm logistical issue center address ; ii ) confirm large cohort patient whether encourage neurologic outcome see preliminary study replicate across different setting compare randomized control group ; iii ) ensure safety EPO population include overall survival incidence subsequent TVEs without EPO .</detailed_description>
