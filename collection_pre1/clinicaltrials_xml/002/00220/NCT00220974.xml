	<brief_title>Study Assess Internet-Based Tailored Advice Could Modify Behaviour Improve Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Internet-based Cholesterol Assessment Trial ( I-CAT ) mask , randomise , control trial include least 3,700 consumer follow 8 16 week . All consumer participate study ultimately offer I-CAT service , provide individually tailor information management cholesterol-related risk via interactive website .

There two type individual involve study : 'index case ' 'friends relative ' index case . The index case randomise intervention control comprise study participant main outcome analysis base . Friends relatives index case involve insomuch ask visit site index case part evaluation effectiveness intervention . Index case comprise mainly individual already know high risk cholesterol-related disease event - example individual establish vascular disease , individual multiple risk factor individual already use cholesterol-lowering therapy . Index case recruit use advertising material place range site include hospital patient service , hospital patient service , general practice , pharmacy , pathology service Internet . All individual provide inform consent ( index case friends relative ) ask answer many question possible XX question baseline questionnaire . The questionnaire seek information individual 's cardiovascular disease history , risk factor , cholesterol level , use medication strategy reduce cholesterol-related cardiovascular risk family history cardiovascular disease high cholesterol level . Once baseline data collection complete index case randomise either intervention control . Randomisation do automatically real time central computerised service . The intervention group receive immediate feedback I-CAT service . The control group receive general information cholesterol-related disease risk derive exist material prepare National Heart Foundation Australia . Hyperlinks range relevant websites provide . In addition , return website 8 week provide follow-up information , control group participant receive tailor feedback I-CAT service give intervention group participant randomisation . In way , study participant ultimately receive advice provide one group immediate advice one group delay advice possible precisely reliably determine value I-CAT service consumer . All primary analysis comparison index case intervention group index case control group conduct accord principle intention-to-treat . For outcome analysis compare proportion index case report outcome ( mean value outcome ) randomise group . Comparisons proportion do use Chi-square test comparison mean do use t-tests .</detailed_description>
