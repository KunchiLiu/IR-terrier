	<brief_summary>This study compare cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy leuprolide acetate ( LA ) cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy saline injection 12 month . Five white male pedophile ( M age , 50 year ; range , 36-58 ) volunteer two-year study . LA administer Depo injection ( 7 mg initially , 22.5 mg every 3 mo ) 12 month , follow saline placebo . Effects LA testosterone level , sexual interest preference visual reaction time ( Abel Assessment ) , penile tumescence ( Monarch PPG ) , well strong urge masturbatory frequency child ( polygraph ) , measure every three month . Subjects treat weekly cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy . On LA , testosterone decrease castrate level . Because suppression testosterone , physiologic arousal response measure penile plethysmography ( penile tumescence ) significantly suppress compare baseline . However , sufficient response remain detect pedophilic interest . This pedophilic interest also detect visual reaction time . All subject self-reported decrease strong pedophilic urge masturbation . When ask pedophilic urge masturbate thought child , polygraph response indicate subject deceptive report decrease . On placebo , testosterone physiologic arousal eventually rise baseline level . At baseline placebo , subject consistently deceptive regard increase pedophilic urge masturbatory frequency note polygraph . Interest preference , measure Abel Assessment Monarch PPG , generally unchanged throughout study . Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy augment LA significantly reduce pedophilic fantasy , urge , masturbation , change pedophilic interest one year therapy . Deceptive response polygraph suggest self-report unreliable . Follow-up utilizing objective measure essential monitoring efficacy treatment pedophilia . Our study support supposition modification pedophilic behavior possible . LA may augment cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy help break sequence lead reoffense .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hormone therapy aim modification basic sex drive , whereas cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy target cognitive process precede event lead pedophilic behavior . Obsession/compulsion sex drive might affect decision process . Because suggest relationship obsessive compulsive disorder paraphilia , SSRIs utilize . Most report document individual case study uncontrolled , retrospective study ( Kafka , 2000 ) . Reports efficacy drug therapy suppression sexual drive modification behavior continue emerge . The anti-androgens , MPA CPA , widely use drug . They provide variable testosterone suppression , dependent dose . LHRH inhibitor GNRH agonist also provide profound testosterone suppression . More recently , triptorelin , agent similar LA , ( Rosler &amp; Wilztum , 1998 ) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) also investigate ( Raymond , Grant , Kim , . &amp; Colemen , 2002 ; Stein , Hollander , Anthony , Schneier , Fallon , Liebowitz , Klein , 1992 ) . Despite recent advance use testosterone-suppressing drug treatment pedophilia , limited information available form well design , control objective study . The lack standardize , objective outcome measure hamper objective assessment efficacy intervention pedophilia ( Briken , Hill , &amp; Berner , 2003 ; Hanson et al. , 2002 ; Marshall &amp; Barbaree , 1990 ) . A multi-disciplinary team expert need assess concurrent , objective physiologic measure response . Though result treatment promising , reliable , well-tolerated approach objectively monitor efficacy lacking . The specific aspect behavior affect therapy , well efficacy , limitation , side effect treatment need determine ( Briken , Hill , &amp; Berner , 2003 ; Raymond , Robinson , Kraft , Rittberg , &amp; Coleman , 2001 ) . The present study assess impact cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy alone versus cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy augment potent testosterone-lowering drug , LA , suppression pedophilic urge arousability . The psychotherapy program comprise cognitive behavioral therapy . Objective assessment sexual interest preference physical arousal , well sexual urge masturbation , monitor , , therapy . The research objectives explore relationship testosterone level sexual interest preference , physiologic response sexual stimulus ( auditory visual ) , self-reported sexual behavior . METHOD Subjects Five men ( M age , 50 year ; range , 36-58 ) , diagnosis pedophilia ( American Psychiatric Association , 1994 ) “ denial ” recruit study . Subjects identified focus group judge , attorney , Probation Parole official , representative District Attorney ’ office psychologist invite seminar regard Lupron Project . After potential subject identify , Principal Investigator screen case history determine eligibility study inclusion ( Table 1 ) . These potential subject contact Principal Investigator . They interview , inform study , invite participate . Three additional subject screen , exclude . These include one psychotic adult , one adolescent , one elderly , nonerectile adult . The study conduct two-year period medical research center north western Pennsylvania . The study review approved local Institutional Review Board . All subject provide informed consent . Participation voluntary condition probation parole . The subject inform would receive either drug placebo without indication duration dose , sequence , sequence would occur . The subject know one another . They live diverse geographical location contact group cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy . IQ data available four five participant , normal IQ ’ . The fifth participant , IQ data unavailable , consider intellectually impaired . Four five participant report sexually abused childhood . Each subject 16 year old least five year old victim offend initiate ( Table II ) . At baseline , self-reported number victim five subject total 329 . Four five serve lengthy prison sentence ( M , 7.8 year ) conviction sexual crime . All subject previous treatment penitentiary community-based sexual offender program . Two history major depression two prior diagnosis alcoholism . Two subject report bisexual pedophilic preference ; two exclusively heterosexual preference ; one exclusively homosexual preference . At baseline throughout study , five subject meet DSM-IV criterion pedophilia , well antisocial personality disorder ( American Psychiatric Association , 1994 ; Berger , Berner , Bolterauer , Gutierrez , &amp; Berger , 1999 ) . Study Design Five male pedophile enter prospective , repeated measure , nonrandomized , mask study . All subject investigator , except Principal Investigator ( PI ) , Project Director , Study Coordinator , mask . The PI administer drug placebo ; PI Project Director design study cognizant dose schedule ; Coordinator responsible supply study drug . However , PI , Project Director , Coordinator involve direct data collection evaluation subject . Each subject serve control . Subjects receive weekly cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy 24 month LA depot injection , 7.5 mg baseline 22.5 mg month 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 . Flutamide ( 250 mg TID 14 day ) administer first injection . Flutamide acetanilid , nonsteroidal , orally active anti-androgen exerts anti-androgenic action inhibit androgen uptake and/or inhibit nuclear bind androgen target tissue . Flutamide demonstrate interfere testosterone cellular level . This complement medical castration achieve LHRH agonists suppress testicular androgen production inhibit luteinizing hormone secretion ( Brogden , 1989 ) . After initial injection , subject sequester one week community protection . After one year therapy , LA discontinue saline placebo substitute . At baseline , one month initiation LA therapy , 3-month interval , subject underwent Abel Assessment , Monarch Penile Plethysmography ( PPG ) , polygraph , physical examination , laboratory study , radiology study , psychological testing . Abel Assessment ( Abel Screening , Inc. , Atlanta , Georgia ) Abel Assessment , combination self-report visual reaction time ( VRT ) , utilized accord manufacturer ’ instruction ( Abel Screening , Inc. , Atlanta , Georgia ) . Assessments conduct trained clinical staff member ( Abel , Huffman , Warberg , &amp; Holland , 1998 ; Letourneau , 2002 ) . A questionnaire also administer . The combined questionnaire VRT result include evaluation 21 sexual interest , include paraphilia . To assess VRT ( amount time subject view picture ) , slide projector use present still image model onto 12-inch computer screen . Models clothe , generally swimsuit , none sexual position . Twenty-one stimulus category , represent 21 potential sexual interest approximately seven slide category , view subject . Slides depict Caucasian African American male female comprise preschool school-age child , adolescent , adult . An examiner meet individually subject instructed advance rating slide . The subject view slide dimly light , quiet cubicle . After practice session , subject complete VRT private . After view slide , participant rat slide scale 1 ( extremely sexually repulsive ) 7 ( extremely sexually interest ) . A computer record amount time subject view rat slide . Data second viewing time utilized Abel Screening , Inc. compute z-scores . These provide investigator graph form , score self-reported interest . Per manufacturer ’ instruction , Abel “ rule third ” utilized define predominant sexual preference . Because large number sexual preference choice generate Abel method , modification adopt . For study , predominant sexual preference define relative visual reaction time z-score  1 SD . The number time stimulus  1 SD record . If one none SDs  1 , two high score record . This modification result objective measure selection stimulate long VRT ( Table III ) . To illustrate difference modify Abel Abel “ Methods Thirds ” , subject # 1 self- report interest adolescent adult male . His known victim boy age 12 17 . Using Abel “ Method Thirds ” per manufacturer instruction , interest preference include young adolescent female , young , adolescent , adult male . Using modified Abel , selection truncate adolescent adult male , exact interest preference self-reported patient ( Table III ) . Z-scores stimulus set report baseline , LA , LA , respectively . Assessments compare , , treatment determine VRT associate pedophilic interest preference change treatment . Given lower testosterone castrate level would affect penile responsiveness potentially affect Monarch PPG monitoring , Abel Assessment incorporate study anticipation pedophilic sexual preference could still potentially detect visual reaction time . Monarch PPG ( Behavioral Technology , Inc. , Salt Lake City , Utah ) The Monarch Adult Projective Audio Visual Set , Version 5 ( Salt Lake City , Utah ) commercially available set standardized stimulus material use assess subject . The stimulus contain audio visual depiction male female comprise preschool grammar school child , adolescent , adult . The audio script base projective , rather explicit , portrayal sexual activity . Unlike PPG visual stimulus , set contain clothed picture child ( child model show bath suit underwear ) . No lewd provocative pose present ( Byrne , 2000 ) . During procedure , subject seat recline chair locate private room equip intercom . The audiovisual stimulus material present via headphone 14-inch television monitor . Stimulus presentation collection penile , galvanic skin response ( GSR ) , respiration data record coordinated microprocessor-based Monarch Data Recording Device ( DRD ) ( Behavioral Technology , Inc. , Salt Lake City , Utah ) . Penile circumference change measure use indium gallium gauge supply Behavioral Technology , Inc . The signal indium gallium gauge amplified 1000 ; data retrieval set rate 10 sample per second . Each penile gauge calibrate full range 3.0 cm assessment ensure correlation circumference deflection linear . GSR electrodes respiration belt also use deterrence potential detection fake suppression attempt . Data assessment compile analyzed use Monarch Adult Male Software Version 3.22f . This software guide collection , management , initial analysis PPG data . The software analyze PPG data provide maximum score area- under-the-curve score 22 segment test . A maximum penile tumescence score calculate subject category stimulus . For purpose study , maximum penile tumescence define response 20 point ( .60 cm ) , 20 % calibration gauge . Murphy Barbaree ( 1994 ) argue minimum level significance 20 % . To meet requirement , response consider significant least 20/100-scaled unit begin stimulus detumesced level . Kuban , Barbaree , Blanchard ( 1999 ) also suggest criterion conservative . Subject 's PPG calibration project full-scale responding set 3.0 cm . Thus , cutoff 20 point significant respond fall within 20 % minimum criterion significant responding . The subject 's PPG calibration project full-scale responding set 3.0 cm circumference . A repeated measure ANOVA perform PPG data ass significant change arousal level throughout study (  = .05 ) . To assess sexual preference , raw data subject transform z-scores . The z-scores stimulus record baseline , LA , LA . All response  1 SD , two high response , record . Finally , subject 's classification pedophilic/nonpedophilic determine use deviance differential ( Harris , Rice , Quinsey , Chaplin , &amp; Earls , 1992 ) . This calculated use z-score data take high response adult ( male female segment ) minus high response infant child ( male female preschool grammar school age ) . The adolescent segment exclude analysis . For purpose data analysis , deviance differential score great 0 classified nonpedophilic score le 0 pedophilic . A deviance differential O would mean subject aroused child adult . All subject assess baseline . One subject # 1 respond level clinical significance ( 20 point ) . Further inspection reveal client obtain significant response point two-year study . He remove analysis PPG data ( repeat measure ANOVA ) low level data generate circumferential PPG transducer consider reliable ( Kuban et al. , 1999 ; Barbaree &amp; Mewhort , 1994 ) . Polygraph An Axciton Computerized Polygraph System ( Axciton Systems , Houston , Texas ) Lafayette Instrument LX-4000 ( Lafayette Instrument Co. , Lafayette , Indiana ) utilize . The examiner certify Colorado Sex Offender Management Board . For purpose score reliability validity confirmation , result score hand score use Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory Polyscore computer score algorithm ( Heil , Ahlmeyer , Simons , &amp; English , 1999 ) . Hand score recognize American Polygraph Association accurate reliable method scoring . It method used evaluate data . The algorithm use quality control check hand score method . Subjects provide separate informed consent first polygraph examination . The test administer private office . The examination take average two hour . Subjects test every three month . Polygraph standardize American Polygraph Association approve test procedure administer single experienced examiner , blind dose protocol . The polygraph examination process contain pretest posttest component . The examiner work closely psychotherapist develop appropriate polygraph question confirmation disclose number victim offense , discovery new offense , compliance study condition . This study examine past victim offense admission data , well responses evaluate 30 paraphilia ( Table IV ) . The pretest establish question examiner would ask base subject ’ self report new admission past offend absence accountability statement know offend behavior ( identify prison history ) . The subject ’ cardiovascular , respiratory , galvanic skin resistance assess response three specific key question : 1 . In past three month , masturbate sexual thought anyone age 18 ? 2 . In past three month , purposely withheld important sexual information therapist ? 3 . In past three month , strong urge initiate sexual contact anyone 18 year old ? No consequence impose deceptive response . The therapist polygrapher work closely debriefed subject assessment identify area counseling , behavior monitor , issue detect polygraph . Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy The psychotherapy program comprise cognitive behavioral therapy . The weekly session co-facilitated two therapist . After establish rule group therapy , psychotherapist guide participant basic group curriculum include break defense mechanism , identify typology sex offender , discuss effect sexual abuse victim . The counseling component involve insight-oriented cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy . This provided dynamic understanding unconscious conflict interpersonal issue relate participant ’ offense cycle . Relapse prevention plan construct participant . This self-controlled program design teach offender recognize intervene behaving manner would lead re-offense . Relapse prevention enable individual maintain newly adopt behavior pattern , refrain deviant thought action . The relapse prevention plan describe red flag , offense cycle , intervention , change thought , feeling , attitude , behavior . Psychopathology The Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised ( PCL-R ) utilize ass subject 's psychopathology ( Hare , 1998 ) . The Minnesota Sex Offender Screening Tool-Revised ( MnSOST-R ) identify violent offender offender likely re-offend ( Epperson et al. , 1999 ) . The Static-99 , another sexual offender risk assessment , measure long-term risk potential child molester ( Hanson &amp; Thornton , 1999 ) . The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ) utilize inferred relationship obsessive compulsive disorder sexual paraphilia ( Goodman et al. , 1989 ) .</detailed_description>
