	<brief_summary>The intent study demonstrate efficacy safety Immune Globulin Intravenous ( Human ) , 10 % Caprylate/Chromatography Purified ( IGIV-C ) newly previously diagnose CIDP subject . Eight course treatment either placebo IGIV-C occur every 3 week . Neurological function measure Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause Treatment ( INCAT ) score . Patients deteriorate show improvement day 16 month 6 receive alternate study drug additional 6 month .</brief_summary>
