Following 8-week run-in period , subject folate depletion arm hospitalize approximately 3 month Rockefeller University Hospital . You may leave hospital day , require return even . During entire time , subject give low folate diet . During last month study , folate supplement give replace folate body . A follow-up visit require approximately 1 month study period . Blood drawn every two week . Four sigmoidoscopy take approximately monthly interval . A male require use effective form birth control throughout participation study two month study end . The folate supplementation study require 8-week run-in period . During run-in period , participant eat average folate diet high folate contain food . There two screen visit period initial blood-work do participant undergo nutritional consultation . Following 8-week run-in period , subject folate supplementation arm give folate supplement 8 week . During entire time , subject continue eat average folate diet high folate contain food . Blood sample colorectal mucosa sample obtain sigmoidoscopy take 3 time 4 week interval .</detailed_description>
