	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine level sulfur amino acid diet need maintain glutathione antioxidant status . This information could prove useful medicine could allow identification optimal diet control antioxidant level . This diet could use conjunction therapy order prevent delay oxidative stress disease may result . Total study participation include screen visit 14-day study period dietary intake sulfur amino acid control . We aim enroll 12 normal subject Emory University Hospital.The primary hypothesis steady-state GSH/GSSG CYS/CYSS redox human plasma become oxidized due SAA intake 0 % RDA reduce due SAA intake 3X RDA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long-term objective research improve definition optimal human SAA intake . This include define Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRI ) , estimate average requirement ( EAR ) , upper limit ( UL ) intake improve understand physiologic pathologic response variatiation SAA intake . Using high-resolution 1H-NMR , plan develop comprehensive metabolic profile indicate SAA intake inadequate . The specific aim current protocol : 1 . To determine whether steady-state GSH/GSSG Cys/CySS redox human plasma oxidize due sulfur amino acid intake 0 % RDA . 2 . To determine whether steady-state GSH/GSSG Cys/CySS become reduce dietary sulfur amino acid repletion SAA 3X RDA . 3 . To determine whether low high sulfur amino acid intake induce primary secondary metabolic effect detectable high-resolution 1H-NMR . B . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : Sulfur amino acid involve central metabolic process . The biologically useful sulfur derive almost exclusively amino acid methionine cysteine . Methionine ( Met ) essential amino acid metabolize individual transulfuration pathway form cysteine ( Cys ) ( 1 ) . In addition use primary sequence protein , Met Cys require metabolic function . Met convert S-adenosylmethionine , use methylation reaction ( 2 ) structural functional modification protein , RNA DNA , well synthesis phospholipid signal molecule . The carbon skeleton Met also use biosynthesis polyamines , require cell division cell growth ( 3 ) . Cysteine use biosynthesis glutathione ( GSH ) , coenzyme A , taurine sulfate ( 4 ) . GSH function redox regulation ( 5 ) detoxification oxidant reactive electrophiles ( 6 ) . Coenzyme A central fatty acid metabolism citric acid cycle ; taurine utilized bile acid synthesis osmotic regulation ( 7 ) ; sulfate use structural component oligosaccharide ( 8 ) , transport steroid hormone ( 9 ) detoxification foreign compound ( 10 ) . Thus , requirement adequate sulfur amino acid intake extends beyond need adequate amount maintain normal protein synthesis turnover . Sulfur amino acid intake human variable optimal SAA intake adequately define . The average American diet contain 100 g protein daily ( 4 ) ; mean SAA intake 2.4 g ( 11 ) . Daily intake range &lt; 0.3 g &gt; 5 g ( 11 ) . Most SAA derive animal protein , constitute 2/3 total protein intake . The content SAA legumes type nut half animal protein plant-derived food contain 10-20 % SAA find equivalent amount animal protein . Because plant-derived food low total protein , individual consume animal protein risk SAA deficiency . Conversely , excess SAA associate health risk due H2S toxic metabolite generate colonic flora , individual consume diet high animal protein would risk ( 12 ) . Hence , Dietary Reference Intake value SAA need foundation improve dietary guideline . Differences quantity time SAA intake result substantial effect Met , Cys GSH homeostasis . Animal study show diurnal variation hepatic GSH level increase follow consumption food high Cys decrease post-absorptive period ( 16-17 ) . The total amount Cys present GSH human body 3 g , roughly equal SAA requirement 3 ( 13 ) Cys supply/utilization pattern consider 4 phase . In first phase , systemic Cys supply dietary Cys metabolism dietary Met . During phase , excess Cys signal enhance catabolism ( 18 ) . Under post-absorptive condition , probably period day , systemic supply Cys occur principally hepatic release GSH ( 14 ) . Under condition , Cys metabolism continue support biosynthetic need taurine sulfate . Although explicitly establish human , diurnal variation hepatic GSH mouse cease 24 h fast systemic Cys supply probably enters third phase 24 h. In phase , increase fraction total systemic supply likely derive non-hepatic tissue ( e.g. , skeletal muscle ; 15 ) . Because sulfate taurine production normally occur intestine liver ( 19 ) , decline utilization Cys function expect phase . A fourth phase appear likely occur 3 day conservation Met Cys would maximal . In addition , detoxification foreign compound conjugation GSH , sulfate taurine require utilization Cys . Such use impose substantial SAA demand ; instance , metabolism 4 dos maximum strength acetaminophen , i.e. , 4 g daily , consume equivalent 250 mg Cys GSH conjugation 640 mg Cys sulfate conjugation ( 13 ) . This amount similar RDA SAA . Thus , combination dietary environmental factor affect SAA homeostasis complex metabolic effect result variation SAA homeostasis emphasize need well mean evaluate adequacy SAA nutrition . This need present otherwise healthy individual accentuate acute chronic illness convalescence metabolic/nutritional stabilization recovery illness . The low intake level select similar low intake level estimate food frequency analysis ( 11 ) . This level could occur vegetarian diet poor selection food , would extreme find prolonged fasting starvation . The upper SAA intake level select 3X RDA 20 % average intake SAA country , thus represent somewhat high otherwise normal SAA intake . High resolution 1H-NMR mass spectrometry provide approach investigate complex metabolic effect diet . Traditional method investigate dietary nutritional component rely upon isolation purification substance specific biologic activity . However , large number compound diet , multiple effect individual compound , metabolic change compound occur consumption complex interaction compound limit ability unravel complex effect due variation SAA intake health , illness recovery illness . Available high resolution metabolic analysis ( 21 ) 1H-NMR mass spectrometry ( MS ) combine bioinformatic tool provide way identify establish pattern metabolic change attribute SAA deficiency excess . We believe environment control dietary change ( e.g . different level SAA intake ) induce individual , observed metabolic change ascribe dietary change . High resolution 1H-NMR MS well suit investigate change body fluid composition large number metabolite present body fluid , many metabolite detect simultaneously metabolites analyzed quantified minimal sample preparation . Examples available study Nicholson coworkers . The use multivariate statistical analysis NMR data evaluate metabolic responses live system development toxicologic screen pharmacologic compound ( 24 ) . The principle detection diet-related effect health toxicologic use ; effect , nutritional deficiency , excess intolerance view toxicologic response express metabolic profile . Thus , believe information-rich character NMR spectra MS data provide powerful approach investigate direct indirect effect nutritional variation SAA intake . Given fundamental role SAA metabolites cell growth regulation , digestion , detoxification , antioxidant defense hormonal signaling , potential risk excess SAA intake , metabolic profiling NMR could provide useful approach define optimum SAA intake , future , diagnose treat SAA malnutrition . Considerable information available concern assignment NMR spectra urine plasma ( e.g. , Ref 22-24 , 38-39 ) ; information provide useful guide possible metabolite could vary function SAA intake . 2-D NMR technique available peak identification . However , goal project require identification chemical specie change , whether change specific frequency attribute variation SAA intake . Significance . The sulfur amino acid , Met Cys , highly variable human food risk associated deficiency excess . Both required physiologic process addition maintenance protein synthesis nitrogen balance , , principle , excess either could lead generation toxic sulfur metabolite colon . The present study test 2 novel approach define dietary sulfur amino acid need ( i.e. , plasma redox metabolic analyse NMR MS ) . The result expect establish feasibility use approach improve definition Dietary Reference Intake value important nutrient .</detailed_description>
