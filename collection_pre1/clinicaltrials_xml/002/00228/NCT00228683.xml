	<detailed_description>COG 9346 - Lay Summary Hepatoblastoma Biology Study Tissue Bank Although tremendous improvement treatment childhood cancer result use clinical trial , clear additional significant progress require good understanding molecular makeup pediatric malignancy . Hepatoblastoma , embryonal tumor liver , rare general population . It occur approximately 1 50,000 child . However , family affect Familial Adenomatous Polyposis , high incidence colon cancer , 850 fold increase frequency Hepatoblastoma . Hepatoblastoma also occur association Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome . Thus occurrence Hepatoblastoma suggest need careful investigation family history malignancy relatives , well search genetic alteration may contribute tumor development . COG cancer researcher try good understand cause Hepatoblastoma . They want develop improved method treatment , diagnosis possibly even prevention . The exact molecule gene study change time progress cancer research make . Not every gene molecule know involved cancer study . Researchers choose study gene molecule think promise . At present , study least three gene plan . In case change may detect normal tissue liver blood cell . One gene study know APC gene . It link colon cancer adult . Rarely gene pass family prone develop colon cancer Hepatoblastoma . We n't know common change gene child Hepatoblastoma . This study try figure gene commonly change Hepatoblastoma . In addition study specific gene molecule , geneticist ( doctor specialize look gene ) look overall genetic content tumor child involve study . This do know karyotype chromosome analysis . It known Hepatoblasomas extra copy certain chromosome . However , know effect extra chromosome might predict child likely respond treatment . One goal study figure biological factor within tumor , include extra chromosome , might help predict child respond best treatment . This hopefully lead well treatment Hepatoblastoma . A single extra blood sample take patient study . We take 1 1/2 teaspoon blood . This amount may less small infant . We also take single blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) parent . A portion tumor tissue remove patient 's surgery biopsy also send . No extra procedure do get tumor tissue . It take surgery need standard care . Patients also ask complete questionnaire background . They may also ask complete follow-up questionnaire provide additional information future .</detailed_description>
