	<brief_summary>Acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) remain one significant potentially lethal complication allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . Depending upon type transplant , incidence acute GVHD vary 20 - 50 % related donor transplant , high 70 - 90 % unrelated donor transplant . Acute GVHD affect skin , liver gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract usually occur within 20 - 40 day bone marrow infusion . Steroids standard initial treatment acute GVHD , approximately 50 % patient either free disease require therapy . In remain patient , GVHD either respond come back tapering steroid . These patient much bad prognosis mortality rate great 70 % . Studies use additional agent antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , monoclonal antibody , anti-lymphocyte globulin show improvement use steroid alone . This lead investigator look new immunosuppressive agent reduce risk severity acute GVHD . The major purpose study evaluate way body use absorbs ( pharmacokinetic profile ) drug call anti tumor necrosis factor antibody ( infliximab ) treatment acute GVHD . Infliximab currently indicate treatment immunologic-based disease ( rheumatoid arthritis , moderately severely active Crohn 's disease , fistulizing Crohn 's disease ) , assume patient inadequate response conventional therapy . It approve treatment GVHD . This Phase I pharmacokinetic study coordinate Pediatric Blood Marrow Transplant Consortium ( PBMTC ) . The study conduct Blood Marrow Transplantation ( BMT ) program Children 's Healthcare Atlanta - Egleston , Emory University Department Pediatrics . The goal enroll 1 - 2 patient study ; accrual via BMT program . Eligible patient must less 18 year age . Patients newly diagnose acute GVHD able participate study . Patients receive single dose infliximab clinic . Since Phase I study , patient blood sample draw measure pharmacokinetics drug . A total 16 blood sample draw 84 day . The sample label code , process , frozen , send batch PBMTC designate laboratory testing . Patients continue drug get prevention GVHD . Additional dose infliximab may give . This decision base result blood test .</brief_summary>
