	<brief_title>Analysis T-Cell Immune Reconstitution Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic BMT Severe SCD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) serious inherit disorder red blood cell shorten life cause life-long problem . One common genetic disease America , SCD affect 1 every 375 African-American live birth , identify routine newborn screening . SCD manifest vaso-occlusive event , common `` sickle pain crisis , '' cause severe unrelenting pain , typically back , chest , long bone . Other type vaso-occlusive event involve spleen , brain ( stoke ) , retina , bone , kidney lung . Patients increase risk death due bacterial infection , damage vital organ , aplastic crisis ( failure produce red cell ) , often suffer chronic organ damage . Patients frequent severe complication early childhood typically felt high risk continue debilitate problem early death . These severely affected child subject effort cure SCD bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) healthy donor . BMT curative SCD provide source normal hemoglobin production . BMT perform give patient high dos chemotherapy , infuse bone marrow healthy donor large vein recipient , follow intensive period supportive care immune suppression . Over 200 patient SCD transplant world-wide , primarily sibling donor HLA ( tissue transplantation type ) match . Of transplanted North American cooperative study , 95 % patient survive transplant , 85 % free sickle cell disease . The Atlanta program large contributor study . Through 2004 , Atlanta transplant 18 child SCD match sibling ; free sickle cell disease none die . Because conventional ( myeloablative ) BMT carry significant risk morbidity mortality ant thus limit use , researcher recently investigate less risky method BMT SCD , call reduce intensity non-myeloablative ( NMA ) transplant . Dr. Catherine Wu Dana Farber Cancer Institute Dr. Laksmannan Krishnamurti Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh perform NMA transplant adult ( Wu ) child ( Krishnamurti ) severe SCD . In Atlanta ( Haight ) , patient continue offer transplant use conventional myeloablative approach . Important question remain functional long-term status transplant SCD patient variety area ; study focus upon immune function . Because little know functional immune status patient non-myeloablative transplant , certainly undergo transplantation diagnosis sickle cell anemia , patient blood sample analyze extent immune reconstitution follow transplant immunophenotyping various immune cell subset , molecular analysis reconstitution T cell neogenesis ( TREC analysis ) T cell receptor complexity ( TCR Vbeta spectratyping ) .</detailed_description>
