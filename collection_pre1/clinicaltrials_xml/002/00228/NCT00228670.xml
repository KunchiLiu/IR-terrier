	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 ) develop method quantify Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) load lung tissue human determine whether EBV viral load significantly high lung tissue patient idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) control lung tissue ; 2 ) determine whether EBV localize epithelial cell IPF lung relate epithelial positivity tissue viral load ; 3 ) measure viral load induce sputum IPF subject time order determine whether periodic active herpes virus replication occur respiratory tract ; 4 ) compare longitudinal measure viral load induce sputum simultaneously collect saliva order ass clinical utility two approach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IPF progressive disease proven treatment , lung transplant . Doctors know cause IPF . We think IPF cause viral infection , particularly herpes virus . The goal experiment build case causal link IPF herpes virus . This information important help u develop new therapy treat patient IPF . We collect lung tissue time lung transplant surgery IPF patient organ donor control . Control lung tissue collect remove part regular care would otherwise discard . No extra tissue take solely research project . We also perform prospective longitudinal study IPF patient household partner . IPF subject include pulmonary disease diagnosis IPF confirm lung biopsy clinical chest CT finding . The control group consist subject without respiratory symptom pulmonary disease household partner spouse enrol IPF subject accompanies IPF patient outpatient clinic visit . If household partner , partner unwilling participate , still enroll IPF subject qualifies study willing participate . Saliva , induce sputum , venous blood collect IPF control subject inform consent clinic visit . Visits usually approximately 3-4 month interval one year period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For study lung tissue , eligible subject IPF patient undergo lung transplant surgery organ donor die nonpulmonary cause . For study clinic , subject IPF patient pulmonary disease IPF diagnosis IPF confirm lung biopsy clinical chest CT finding . The control group consist subject without respiratory symptom pulmonary disease household partner spouse enrol IPF subject accompany IPF patient outpatient clinic visit . Failure patient provide inform consent .</criteria>
