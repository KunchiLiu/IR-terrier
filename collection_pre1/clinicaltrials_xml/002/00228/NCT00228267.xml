	<detailed_description>Chronic daily headache ( CDH ) common extremely disable pain syndrome recent estimate point prevalence 2.98 % general population1 Other study estimate prevalence 4.1 % 4.7 % high prevalence woman 9 % .2,3 The condition disable major cause loss function work capacity result significant personal national economic loss4 Therapeutic option treat chronic headache disorder legion diverse steady stream publication advocate novel therapy . Pharmacological option advocate include : sodium valproate , olanzapine , tricyclic Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor antidepressant , tizanidine , butalbital , nefazodone , baclofen , prochlorperazine , intravenous lignocaine , dihydroergotamine , opioids , monoamine oxidase inhibitor , triptans , botulinum toxin , cryotherapy analgesic withdrawal5-20 There much debate headache treatment fail propose choice inappropriate agent significant reason patients21 On basis small number study intravenous propofol advocate treatment chronic daily headache22-24 It seem fair conclude exist strife promote propofol effective intervention treat CDH absence randomize control trial merely reflect lack single good treatment option condition . It , furthermore , reasonable speculate beneficial effect see propofol placebo response . Krusz et al report effect subanesthetic dos intravenous propofol chronic migraine cohort 77 subject open-label study22 Propofol administer intermittent bolus ; average dose use 110mg . It report 63 77 patient report complete abolition headache average time 20 - 30 minute propofol treatment . The range propofol dos use however clearly state assessment intervention beyond 24 hour . In study lidocaine mixed propofol reduce pain injection could say certainty lidocaine effect headache . Mendes et al retrospectively report 21 independent treatment propofol 18 patient suffer primary secondary chronic daily headache 1 year period 23 Subanesthetic dos propofol administer intermittent intravenous bolus 20 - 30mg every 3 5 minute ( range 60 - 380 mg ) . 6 patient report complete relief pain treatment , 1 patient pain relief ; average patient report 58.92 % decrease pain use 0 - 10 scale . It report 8 patient ' headache cycle break follow several day later information available long term impact intervention . In two study appear good tolerance propofol significant adverse event . Drummond - Lewis report 2 hospitalized patient refractory migraine treat anesthetic bolus dos propofol ( 0.5 - 1mg / kg ) report success 24 . The author comment uncertainty effective dose propofol treatment . Propofol safe modern , non-barbiturate intravenous anesthetic induction agent introduce clinical anesthesia 1977 . It establish place practice many ideal characteristic ; cause rapid smooth loss consciousness rapid recovery , make ideal agent day-case procedures25,26 There extensive use propofol intravenous sedative procedure endoscopy , electroconvulsive therapy , cardioversion long term sedation intensive care unit.27,28 Propofol useful antiemetic property know anti-epileptic antipruritic.29 Although propofol cause pain intravenous injection several strategy reduce problem.30 There report rare fatality associate high dos propofol report pancreatitis single doses.31,32 Propofol ( 2,6 di-isopropylphenol ) available emulsion 1 % propofol 10 % soyabean oil , 2 % glycerol 1.2 % egg phosphatide . Doses 2.5mg / kg use induction anesthesia dose 200ug / kg /min use sedation purposes.33 It remain uncertain propofol might exert action relieve headache . Propofol known stimulate gamma - aminobutyric acid- A ( GABA-A ) receptor enhance channel opening34 It show GABA ergic drug include sodium valproate , gabapentin topiramate place treatment migraine speculate propofol might work similar way.35 Nonetheless , know propofol important pharmacological activity include N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism , sympathetic inhibition , stimulation nitric oxide production , calcium channel inhibition modulation prostaglandin E2 hyperalgesia.36-39 We propose premature speculate action propofol headache without clear evidence efficacy . There ongoing discussion good definition chronic daily headache ; term define International Classification Headache Disorders ( ICHD ) 40 This potential impediment research . It propose chronic daily headache subclassified primary headache include transform migraine ( TM ) , chronic tension-type headache ( CTTH ) , hemicrania continuum ( HC ) new daily persistent headache ( NDPH ) 41 Secondary CDH identifiable underlying cause e.g . post traumatic , cervical spine disorder , vascular disorder , chronic meningitis , idiopathic intracranial hypertension , temporamandibular joint dysfunction sinus disorder . Silberstein et al highlight chronic daily headache classify accord ICHD ; however , 1996 manage completely sub-classified population CDH sufferer transform migraine ( TM ) 78 % , chronic tension-type headache ( CTTH ) 15.3 % `` '' 6.7 % .42 Silberstein define chronic daily headache headache last 4 hour day 15 day month definition use later study propofol headache . This definition become perhaps less crucial deal population patient suffer intractable continuous headache ; tend characteristic patient already know u University Alberta Hospital Pain Centre . Significance importance Although reasonably argue propofol sedation administer safely non-anesthetists , still possibility serious airway complication cardiorespiratory depression.43 The administration propofol undertaken lightly certainly use indication subject rigorous trial . Previous study propofol headache examine short- term impact intervention pain score . The study propose look effect treatment pain quality life long period - 30 day . If subanesthetic dos propofol find effective reduce chronic daily headache become arm relatively safe non- narcotic intervention extremely disable disorder could provide variety centre e.g. , emergency room , pain clinic , neurological facility . In view reluctance emergency department administer narcotic chronic headache speculate emergency department may willing provide treatment narcotics.44 Hypothesis A single subanesthetic dose propofol result improve pain quality life next 30 day person chronic daily headache ( CDH ) Specific objectives To measure effect single infusion propofol 40 mcg / kg / minute 60 min headache-related quality life ( measure Headache Disability Index ) headache severity ( measure Headache Index ) subject chronic daily headache 30 days45-47 Study Site The Chronic Pain Centre 1A1 Walter Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre , University Alberta , Edmonton .
