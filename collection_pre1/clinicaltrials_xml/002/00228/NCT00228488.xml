	<brief_summary>Two different patient population target study . The first population ( SP1 ) include patient recurrent/metastatic head neck cancer , exclude salivary gland carcinoma . The second population ( SP2 ) include treatment-naïve patient locally advance squamous cell head neck cancer ( SCHNC ) . SP1 treat palliative intent patient treatment-naïve receive prior chemotherapy . Study treatment consist Iressa ( gefitinib ) alone . SP2 treat radical intent . The patient must treatment-naïve study treatment consist induction Iressa 3 week follow combination Iressa plus cisplatin concurrent irradiation .</brief_summary>
