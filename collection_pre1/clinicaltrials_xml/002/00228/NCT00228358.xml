	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study safety ability expand laboratory-treated T cell give together cyclophosphamide denileukin diftitox treat patient human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) -2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer , ovarian cancer , non-small cell lung cancer previously treat HER-2/neu vaccine . Laboratory-expanded T cell may help immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Biological therapy , denileukin diftitox , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Giving laboratory-treated T cell together cyclophosphamide denileukin diftitox may allow immune system kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Denileukin Diftitox Followed By Expanding Patient 's Own T Cells Laboratory Treating Patients With HER-2/Neu Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer , Ovarian Cancer , Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With HER-2/Neu Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility expand HER2 specific T cell ex vivo infusion subject advance HER2 overexpressing cancer . II . To assess toxicity associate infuse autologous HER2 specific T cell patient use either single dose cyclophosphamide ONTAK ( denileukin diftitox ) prior T cell infusion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate extent HER2 specific T cell immunity boost individual treat single dose cyclophosphamide ONTAK follow infusion autologous HER2 specific T cell . II . To investigate potential anti-tumor effect HER2 specific T cell patient HER2 overexpressing advanced-stage cancer . III . To evaluate long tumor antigen specific T cell immune augmentation persist vivo single dose cyclophosphamide ONTAK follow infusion autologous HER2 specific T cell . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cell . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . GROUP A : Patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -1 3 escalate dos autologous ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cell IV 30 minute day 1 , 10 , 20 . GROUP B : Patients receive ONTAK ( denileukin diftitox ) IV 1 hour day -1 3 escalate dos autologous ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cell IV 30 minute day 1 , 10 , 20 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
