	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To examine engraftment rate patient receive vivo T-cell-depleted G-CSF stimulate bone marrow partially mismatch related donor . - To evaluate incidence severity acute chronic graft-versus-host disease patient receive vivo T-cell-depleted G-CSF stimulate bone marrow partially mismatch related donor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>G-CSF PMRD : Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) Stimulated Bone Marrow In Vivo T-Cell Depletion Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single-arm , non-randomized feasibility study . Patients meet criterion study enter sequentially completion closure study . Early stopping rule employ ascertain whether unacceptable rate toxicity ( non-engraftment , and/or acute GVHD ) occur . Patients prepare transplant administration follow condition regimen base primary disease : - Total body irradiation ( 1400 rads 8 fractionated dos ) high dose chemotherapy , include cytosine arabinoside , etoposide , cyclophosphamide . Patients bone marrow failure syndrome receive etoposide condition regimen . - Post transplant immunosuppression prophylaxis acute GVHD include sequential administration cyclosporine , methotrexate , basiliximab mycophenolate . - The donor receive 3 daily G-CSF injection prior marrow harvest start day -3 . The injection may initiate donor 's primary physician prior donor 's arrival , BMT service Children 's Healthcare Atlanta . - Patients receive daily GM-CSF injection ( 250 mcg/m2 ) start day +7 post transplant absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great 2,000/ÂµL three day .</detailed_description>

Partially mismatch relate donor availability define molecular type 3 5 HLA match . Patients 22 year age . Patients exclude base sex , racial , ethnic background . Patients exclude demonstrate significant functional deficit major organ , would obviously interfere successful outcome follow bone marrow transplant utilize follow guideline . Evidence active , deepseated , lifethreatening infection know effective therapy ( certain fungal specie , HIV , etc. ) . Patients treated infection must appropriate response document 2 ( two ) consecutive negative culture and/or stable radiographic examination . Patients active central nervous system ( CNS ) leukemic disease . Patients exclude woman childbearing potential currently pregnant ( betaHCG+ ) practice adequate contraception . Patients previous hematopoietic stem cell transplant exclude . Donors exclude sensitive E. coliderived protein .</criteria>
