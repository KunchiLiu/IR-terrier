	<brief_summary>In study , propose determine effect weight loss amount body fat , body fat distribution , severely obese patient . We also want determine measurement ( waist , hip thigh circumference ) best show change body fat fat distribution group . Most importantly , want relate change body measurement change health indicator ( blood cholesterol , blood pressure , blood sugar , liver function ) . With finding study , clinician able predict improvement health base change waist , hip thigh size . Because pilot study , focus woman , make bulk clinic population . We also focus racial difference Caucasians Blacks .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Changes Abdominal Fat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe obesity affect 4.7 % U.S. population . A significant number individual suffer impaired glucose tolerance type II diabetes due insulin resistance ( IR ) . Although generally accept accumulation intraabdominal ( IA ) fat increase risk develop IR , mechanisms responsible phenomenon yet understood . In addition , role subcutaneous ( SC ) fat towards etiology IR - protective , inert detrimental - still debate . This SC adipose tissue release adipocytokines ( IL-6 , leptin , TNF-a ) demonstrate impair insulin action . In individual severely obese , hyperinsulinemia may induce exaggerated production adipocytokines IA compare SC fat store . Our specific aim : ( 1 ) determine relative contribution abdominal SC fat versus IA fat systemic level IL-6 , leptin TNF-a lean severely obese individual ; ( 2 ) determine effect systemic adipocytokine concentration whole body well tissue sensitivity insulin . Hypothesis : ( ) In context severe obesity , IA fat produce increase quantity IL-6 , leptin TNF-a compare SC fat ; ( b ) In severely obese patient undergo weight loss , whole body tissue IR predict change systemic adipocytokines . Methods : Adipose tissue content IL-6 , leptin TNF-a determine ELISA biopsy obtain IA SC fat store lean severely obese patient . Computer tomography-determined area IA SC fat relate change systemic adipocytokines baseline 6-mo follow weight loss therapy . Changes systemic IL-6 , leptin TNF-a assess measurement make baseline follow 6-mo weight loss . For time period also determine change whole body ( via IVGTT ) tissue sensitivity insulin ( via glucose uptake muscle fat ) . Relationships systemic adipocytokines IR assess use uni- multivariate correlation analysis . These novel study determine whether hypersecretion adipocytokines IA versus SC adipose tissue induces IR patient severe obesity .</detailed_description>
