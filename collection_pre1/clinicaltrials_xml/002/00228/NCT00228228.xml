	<brief_summary>In present study , , investigator Sheba Medical Center , intend evaluate T cell vaccination ( TCV ) patient probable multiple sclerosis ( MS ) within 3 month first clinical attack . It utmost importance evaluate treatment effect onset disease , i.e . patient probable MS , order evaluate whether early treatment prevent second attack ( conversion definite MS ) . Moreover , disease onset , immunological process epitope spread associate exposure immune system myelin antigen still limit . With additional attack , increase recognition new self-determinants encephalitogenic peptide present immune system inflammatory process occurs , enhances disease activity . The aim early TCV treatment approach stop process early possible , onset disease , thus prevent additional attack disease progression . We evaluate effect TCV clinical , immunological magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) parameters patient probable MS .</brief_summary>
