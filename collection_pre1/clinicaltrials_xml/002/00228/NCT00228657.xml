	<brief_title>Formation Severity Pressure Ulcers Associated With 4 % Albumin vs. 0.9 % Sodium Chloride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pressure ulcer incur multiple risk patient . The disruption skin portal entry infection , may remain localised site become blood borne . A pressure ulcer lead protein fluid loss wind exudate . Many author theorise existence relationship development pressure ulcer low serum albumin level however , strong evidence prove correlation . The literature demonstrate clear relationship people exist pressure ulcer presence low serum albumin . Specifically serum albumin level &lt; 30mg/dl associate incidence pressure ulcer development .</detailed_description>
