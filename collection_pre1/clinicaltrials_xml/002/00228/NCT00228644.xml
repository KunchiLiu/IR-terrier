	<detailed_description>The objective research evaluate toxicological perturbation metabolism due complex chemical mixture diet-chemical interaction use high-resolution 1H-NMR . These experiment design provide data extent normal variation metabolic profile within healthy individual , combination key GSH redox measurement , show whether change due chemical exposure diet discriminate . The specific aim current protocol : 1 . To determine whether SAA-free diet ( 2 day ) APAP ( 2 dose 15 mg/kg ) independently alter SAA homeostasis metabolism thiol-disulfide redox state ( GSH/GSSG Cys/CySS ) . 2 . To determine whether 2 dos APAP interact SAA-free diet ( 2 day ) effect plasma GSH concentration redox state . 3 . To use 1H-NMR spectroscopy determine whether metabolic change induce combined exposure APAP SAA-free diet quantitatively qualitatively different induce either alone . A . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : Sulfur amino acid involve central metabolic process . The sulfur-containing amino acid , methionine cysteine , require diverse , critical biologic function , include protein synthesis , methylation , fatty acid metabolism , osmotic regulation regulation cell division growth ( 1-5 ) . Methionine ( Met ) essential amino acid metabolize individual transulfuration pathway form cysteine ( Cys ) ( 6 ) . In addition use primary sequence protein , Met Cys require metabolic function . Met convert S-adenosylmethionine , use methylation reaction ( 1 ) structural functional modification protein , RNA DNA , well synthesis phospholipid signal molecule . Cysteine use biosynthesis glutathione ( GSH ) sulfate ( 2 ) . GSH function redox regulation ( 7 ) detoxification oxidant reactive electrophiles ( 8 ) ; sulfate use structural component oligosaccharide ( 3 ) , transport steroid hormone ( 4 ) detoxification foreign compound ( 9 ) . Because SAA irreversibly modify aforementioned process , requirement adequate sulfur amino acid intake extends beyond need adequate amount maintain normal protein synthesis turnover . Sulfur amino acid intake human variable optimal SAA intake adequately define . The Recommended Dietary Allowance SAA base upon nitrogen sulfur amino acid balance study adult male 1 g ( 210 mg Met plus 800 mg Met Cys ) ( 10,11 ) . The average American diet contain 100 g/d protein ( 2 ) ; mean SAA intake 2.4 g , large variation , range &lt; 0.3 g &gt; 5 g ( 12 ) . Most SAA derive animal protein , constitute 2/3 protein intake . Except legume nut , gram plant-derived protein contain 10-20 % SAA content animal protein ( 13,14 ) . Because plant-derived food low total protein , individual consume animal protein risk SAA deficiency . The number Americans low dietary intake SAA relatively small , people undergo intermittent period SAA deficiency due food selection , diet , fast illness . The non-protein content Cys human liver 1 g , largely present GSH , approximate daily SAA requirement ( 15 ) . Chemical detoxification place burden upon SAA supply . GSH conjugation sulfate conjugation represent common quantitatively important pathway metabolism foreign compound . One example , propose use present study , acetaminophen ( APAP ) . About 15 % APAP excrete parent compound 55 % metabolize conjugation glucuronic acid ( 16-18 ) . The remainder metabolize conjugation sulfate ( 25 % ) GSH ( 5 % ) . If one considers metabolism 4 dos maximum strength acetaminophen ( MW 151 ) , i.e. , 4 g daily , consume 200 mg Cys GSH conjugation 1 g Cys supply sulfate conjugation ( 15 ) . Without added sulfate sulfite diet , sulfate derive dietary SAA ( 2,19 ) . Thus , total equivalent SAA need metabolism maximum daily dose APAP great RDA SAA . Thus , interaction APAP intake SAA deficiency expect , interaction may significant even normal therapeutic dosing relatively modest level ( e.g. , 1 2 day ) SAA insufficiency . We propose provide useful model investigate chemical interaction human major metabolite APAP Cys readily measurable converse effect , APAP SAA metabolism SAA availability APAP metabolism , determine . Both Cys deficiency APAP metabolism affect GSH homeostasis , clinical assay GSH redox ( 7 , 20-21 ) provide sensitive mean evaluate interactive effect 2 experimental manipulation . High resolution 1H-NMR mass spectrometry provide approach investigate complex metabolic effect diet . Traditional method investigate interactive effect chemical exposure rely upon detection specific pathologic physiologic response combination specific biologic activity . An alternate approach use available high resolution metabolic analysis ( 22 ) combine bioinformatic tool , examine metabolic effect chemical interaction global manner . In principle , simultaneously examine effect hundred metabolite , approach provide possibility detect unanticipated interactive effect . A guide principle development high-resolution metabolic analyse metabolic profile healthy individual share common feature toxicologic pathologic consequence diet , disease , environment genetics reflect variation metabolic profile . Studies rodents show characteristic pattern metabolic change associate organ-specific toxicity chemical agent share structural similarity ( 23-24 ) . If approach extend human identify healthy unhealthy metabolic profile , pattern could provide powerful new approach identify diagnose toxicity associate chemical mixture diet-drug interaction . This proposal conduct pilot study determine whether diet-drug interaction detect metabolic pattern healthy adult subject . We believe environment control specific chemical exposure change ( e.g. , +APAP , +dietary SAA ) , observe metabolic change ascribe respective exposure . High resolution 1H-NMR , liquid chromatography , mass spectrometry ( MS ) well suit investigating change body fluid composition large number metabolite present body fluid , many metabolite detect simultaneously . Examples available study Nicholson coworkers ( 23 , 24 ) .The use multivariate statistical analysis NMR data evaluate metabolic responses live system development toxicologic screen pharmacologic compound ( 25 ) . The principle detection chemical interaction free-living human ; effect , change metabolic profile expect provide sensitive mean non-invasively detect condition risk toxicity pathology . Considerable information available concern assignment NMR spectra urine plasma ( e.g. , Ref 23-25 , 36-37 ) ; information provide useful guide possible metabolite could vary function SAA intake APAP exposure . 2-D NMR technique available peak identification . However , goal project require identification chemical specie change , whether change specific frequency attribute variation SAA intake . Significance . While general consensus chemical interaction pose significant human health risk , identification risk remain largely intractable problem . Detailed metabolic analysis combine bioinformatic method provide potentially powerful approach identify risk term perturb metabolic profile . However , large variety food drug consume different individual complicates already difficult task distinguish signal noise validate stability recovery hundred metabolite . The significance current proposal use repetitive measure within individual highly control environmental dietary condition determine whether exposure chemical non-toxic condition result sufficient perturbation metabolism detect promising analytical approach . The result show whether 1H-NMR sensitivity detect metabolic effect due variation chemical exposure dietary intake common among human . If , result establish 1H-NMR analysis use study consequence chemical toxicity also study risk toxicity due chemical interaction occur usual occupational therapeutic condition . B . PRELIMINARY STUDIES : Use GSH/GSSG redox evaluate oxidative stress . This proposal base upon long-standing effort understand control function GSH-dependent antioxidant system human . The balance GSH GSSG determine balance oxidation due oxidative stress capacity NADPH-dependent reductase reduce GSSG back GSH . Studies interaction GSH cysteine pool human plasma reveal GSH redox characteristic suitable use indicator balance oxidative antioxidant process ( 26 ) . In addition , study human cell culture show substantial variation GSH/GSSG redox occur normal life cycle cell ( 13 , 27-28 ) , central present proposal , substantial oxidation induce Cys deficiency ( 29 ) . These result imply variation GSH/GSSG redox may indicator oxidative stress , may indicator cell survival/cell death balance central tissue homeostasis . With interpretation , GSH/GSSG redox reflect underlie tissue health ; oxidize state serf platform toxicity regardless whether oxidation due genetic abnormality , nutritional deficiency , inflammation , chemical exposure . Thus , chemical exposure result GSH oxidation cysteine utilization exacerbate effect due limited cysteine intake . Because ) sulfur amino acid deficiency associate oxidation thiol/disulfide redox , b ) sulfur amino acid require many different metabolic process , c ) many enzyme potentially affect change thiol/disulfide redox state , diverse metabolic effect may occur readily predicable metabolic profile cysteine metabolic pathway chemical detoxify cysteine-dependent pathway . Hence , central question current proposal whether chemical exposure increase demand sulfur SAA interact dietary availability SAA produce perturbation metabolism detect high resolution 1H-NMR spectroscopy . Clinical study GSH/GSSG redox variation . We make surprise find substantial oxidation ( approximately 25 mV ) apparent individual &gt; 60 compare &lt; 43 old ( 30 ) . We also find diabetic individual 20 mV oxidize similarly age individual without know disease . In follow-up study , find GSH/GSSG redox function age biphasic , apparent association age 45 linear oxidation age 50 . Preliminary data study diurnal variation GSH/GSSG redox status show increase GSH evening nighttime hour redox state reduced time period . These result consistent rodent study show hepatic GSH undergoes diurnal variation link sulfur amino acid intake ( 31-32 ) . These result support central hypothesis sulfur amino acid intake determinant plasma GSH/GSSG redox state human . Effects chemical exposure GSH redox human . We perform 2 clinical study indicate chemical exposure alters sulfur amino acid homeostasis detect change plasma GSH Cys pool . As indicated , one show GSH redox become oxidized consequence chemotherapy ( 33 ) . A second study show Cys GSH pool oxidized individual smoke cigarette compare ( 34 , 38 ) . Together , study indicate chemical exposure induce significant change Cys GSH homeostasis . Interactions GSH cysteine pool human plasma . To determine interaction GSH/GSSG Cys/CySS pool , thiol disulfide form measure plasma 24 healthy individual age 25-35 ( 26 ) . In study , GSH concentration correlate Cys concentration , correlation observe GSSG CySS reduce oxidized component . The lack equilibration value support interpretation plasma GSH Cys redox value dynamic indicator systemic balance oxidative antioxidant process ( 26 ) . Cys deficiency vitro result substantial oxidation GSH/GSSG redox . In study Cys deficiency readdition Cys colon carcinoma HT29 cell line , found culture medium low Cys CySS result decreased GSH GSSG associate 80 mV oxidation GSH/GSSG redox state ( 29 ) . Upon addition either Cys CySS , redox GSH/GSSG recover 1 h GSH concentration continue increase 8 h ( 33 ) . These result confirm Hela cell normal human retinal pigment epithelial cell ( show ) indicate variation Cys availability cell general effect GSH/GSSG redox state . Oxidation extracellular thiol/disulfide redox state sensitizes cell chemical-induced toxicity . Oxidative stress increase expression death receptor component , Fas Fas ligand ( 35 ) . To determine whether change thiol/disulfide redox state could affect sensitivity chemical toxicity , normal human retinal pigment epithelial cell culture medium systematic variation Cys CySS concentration give range redox value find vivo human plasma treat oxidant t-butylhydroperoxide . The result show cell culture reduced redox state resistant oxidant-induced apoptosis cell culture oxidized redox state . While yet clear general effect regard cell type chemical , result suggest change redox state , per se , may important determinant susceptibility toxicity . Together finding , result provide strong justification explore whether interaction chemical exposure diet induce detectable redox change whether diverse metabolic consequence variation thiol/disulfide redox state detect high resolution metabolic analysis . High-resolution 1H-NMR human urine . To examine sensitivity instrumentation obtain NMR spectra suitable measurement metabolic change response vary sulfur amino acid intake , obtain spectra urine collect 2 successive day without oral supplementation 3 g Cys . Samples ( 300 μl ) mix 150 μl 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7.4 , 50 μl 2H2O prior record spectra Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer . Although data preliminary make conclusion , result demonstrate spectral quality similar report Nicholson colleague ( 23-25 , 36-37 ) suitable detection change concentration large number metabolite . In particular , peak identify Nicholson present several difference evident sample supplemental Cys without .</detailed_description>
