	<brief_summary>This multi-institution , single arm , non-randomized pilot study coordinate Pediatric Blood Marrow Transplant Consortium . Eligible patient severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome ( SCID ) severe T-cell immunodeficiency disorder . Patients disorder properly function immune system . Without treatment , disorder result early childhood death . The standard treatment use disease give patient stem cell transplant match donor . The donor cell family member , unrelated marrow donor umbilical cord blood . The donor source impact transplant risk approach preparative regimen . There many different preparative regimen use patient SCIDS severe T-cell immunodeficiency syndrome . Some patient get preparative regimen , others get antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ; immune protein make horse , give , kill lymphocyte ) . Still patient get conventional chemotherapy . In child treat nothing ATG alone , increase risk graft failure partial engraftment . When happens , patient need life-long therapy immunoglobulins support immune system . Children treat chemotherapy generally full immune recovery , also may major side effect chemotherapy . The side effect include infection , organ failure infertility . This protocol , combination parallel study separate preparative regimen , attempt answer question patient primary immunodeficiency need preparative regimen intensity need . Patients enrol accord disease type donor source . The purpose study see much chemotherapy actually need transplant work . To able still make transplant work , drug use temporarily weaken immune system strengthen . In group , patient treat lower dos busulfan find low dose drug need get full immune recovery . The investigator hope regimen result complete immune system recovery limit side effect chemotherapy . A second purpose study track recovery different part immune system . The investigator also want identify whether recovery come donor stem cell patient . The patient admit hospital transplant expect stay 4 6 week . The preparative regimen make busulfan , fludarabine antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) . After preparative regimen , cell donor give . To try keep patient 's body reject donor cell donor cell attack patient 's body ( graft-versus-host disease , GVHD ) , cyclosporine give . The investigator draw extra 2 - 4 teaspoon blood specify time point test immune recovery donor cell chimerism ( portion blood belongs donor ) . Standard bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) clinical care provide respect pretransplant evaluation , peritransplant support , posttransplant follow-up .</brief_summary>
