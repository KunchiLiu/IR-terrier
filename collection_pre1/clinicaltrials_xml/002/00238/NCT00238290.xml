	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use letrozole may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Giving trastuzumab together letrozole disease progression may effective treatment breast cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give trastuzumab together letrozole work treat postmenopausal woman progressive advanced breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Letrozole Treating Postmenopausal Women With Progressive Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) monotherapy follow trastuzumab letrozole woman progressive advanced breast cancer resistant prior treatment nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor . Secondary - Determine safety profile regimen patient . - Correlate HER-2-extracellular domain ( ECD ) level response treatment patient . - Determine efficacy regimen patient . - Correlate response time tumor progression change serum HER-2-ECD level patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) IV 30-90 minute week 1-3 OR week 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience disease progression 9 week receive trastuzumab oral letrozole daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week disease progression 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
