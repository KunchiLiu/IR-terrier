	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish long-term safety efficacy Biogeneric Epoetin , attainability therapeutic target anaemia management , impact Epoetin treatment long-term health outcome cost effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cohort Study Determine Long-Term Safety Efficacy Biogeneric Epoetin Treatment Renal Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study protocol elaboration original study protocol title `` A Randomized , Multi-center , Open label trial establish therapeutic equivalence Biogeneric Epoetin Eprex determine long term safety profile Biogeneric Epoetin patient Hemodialysis '' . In first stage , biogeneric Epoetin shall evaluate randomized trial design demonstrate therapeutic equivalence ( TE ) versus innovator product ( Eprex ) , efficacy clinical end-point Hb 6 12 week treatment . When preliminary evidence efficacy establish stage 1 TE trial , product may proceed evaluated stage 2 single group cohort study design establish long term safety , particular emphasis surveillance occurrence Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) immunogenicity relate adverse event . To establish long term efficacy , emphasis potential impact batch batch variation product content potency ( bioactivity ) Hb response . This practical trial also design investigate cost-effectiveness estimate optimal dosage combination Epoetin Iron sucrose achieve Hb target unconstrained prescriptionas , hence budgetary requirement estimate meet therapeutic target dialysis population various pricing scenario presence generic competition .</detailed_description>
