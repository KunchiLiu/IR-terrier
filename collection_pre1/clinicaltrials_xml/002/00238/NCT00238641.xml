	<brief_summary>In child cerebral palsy , stiffness arm develop early delay prevent acquisition normal hand skill . Improvement functional use hand may therefore dependent upon early treatment upper extremity hypertonia . We propose test series injection Myobloc™ non-randomized one-way crossover pilot clinical trial dose-finding study , clinical assessment blind video evaluation . Ten child age 2-17 year increase tone elbow wrist expect complete study . A 1-month baseline evaluation period follow injection low-dose Myobloc™ affect muscle ( ) arm accord standardized per-kilogram dose maximum 25U/kg affected arm . Three month later , second injection 50U/kg perform affected arm . Three month second dose , third dose 100U/kg perform affected arm . Neurological assessment perform study entry , prior injection , 1 3 month follow injection . Routine physical therapy non-study medication continue study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects : 10 subject age 2-17 year hypertonia affect one upper extremity , without injection neuromuscular block agent six month prior enrollment , surgery upper extremity . Intervention : Injection Myobloc™ 2 site per muscle two muscle upper extremity ( biceps , brachioradialis ) , maximum dose 25Units/kg/arm first injection , maximum 50Units/kg/arm second injection , maximum 100Units/kg/arm third injection . If significant weakness worsen function follow injection , dose increase subsequent injection . Injections perform placement topical anesthetic ( ELA-MAX™ cream ) , use EMG guidance identify active muscle contribute hypertonia . Primary outcome measure : The primary outcome measure time take complete maximum arm extension voluntary reaching , measure coraco-acromial joint midpoint dorsum wrist . Change score calculate intake 1 month ( baseline effect ) , 1 month 2 month ( first injection effect ) , 4 month 5 month ( second injection effect ) , 7 month 8 month ( third injection effect ) . A device call Shape Tape ( Measureand , Inc. ) use measure outcome . Shape Tape flexible strip portable spring steel optic fiber provide instantaneous readout portable computer bend twist form movement capture conduct clinical setting . The Shape Tape fasten loosely body part measurement ( case , subject ’ wrist shoulder ) either medical-grade adhesive tape Velcro . The shapetape connect portable computer , custom software allow measurement average velocity hand movement reaching . Secondary outcome measure : The rater compare improvement worsen global arm function Unified Dystonia Rating Scale ( UDRS ) , motor subscale Unified Parkinson ’ Disease rating scale ( UPDRS ) , Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale ( BFM ) . Comparisons perform intake 1 month ( baseline effect ) , 1 month 2 month ( first injection effect ) , 4 month 5 month ( second injection effect ) , 7 month 8 month ( third injection effect ) . Other secondary measure include neurological examination , Ashworth spasticity scale , comparison numerical stiffness measure measure Rigidity Analyzer Device . A parent rating scale , Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ( PedsQL ) , use determine overall functional improvement . Statistical analysis : The outcome test 0.05 level significance use repeated-measures analysis variance ( ANOVA ) Friedman nonparametric test apply 4 repeated change score primary secondary outcome measure . Tests significance secondary measure correct multiple comparison .</detailed_description>
