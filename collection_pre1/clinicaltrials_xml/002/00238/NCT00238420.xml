	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect give paclitaxel together radiation therapy without trastuzumab see well work kill remain tumor cell patient undergone surgery bladder cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Paclitaxel may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving paclitaxel together radiation therapy trastuzumab may kill tumor cell . Giving treatment surgery may kill remain tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Radiation Therapy With Without Trastuzumab Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine acute toxicity ( = &lt; 90 day protocol treatment start ) chemoradiotherapy include paclitaxel +/- trastuzumab irradiation non-cystectomy patient without her2/neu overexpression , abbreviate HER2+ HER2- , respectively . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine ability patient bladder cancer non-cystectomy candidate complete treatment program . II . To evaluate efficacy treatment program achieve complete response primary tumor . III . To measure 5-year disease-free overall survival patient bladder cancer treat transurethral resection bladder follow chemoradiotherapy . IV . To estimate value tumor and/or serum biomarkers predictors initial tumor response recurrence-free survival . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group accord HER2/neu status ( HER2/neu 2+ 3+ stain [ group 1 ] v HER2/neu 0 1+ stain [ group 2 ] ) . GROUP I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) IV 90 minute day 1 30 minute day 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 , 36-40 , 43-47 , 50 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP II : Patients receive paclitaxel undergo radiotherapy group 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-5 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
