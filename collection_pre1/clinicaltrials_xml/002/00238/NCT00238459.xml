	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine role HIV-specific CD4 T cell response immune response dependent upon CD4 response develop antiretroviral drug start acute recent HIV infection , whether CD4 response enhance therapeutic HIV vaccine ( HIV-1 immunogen ) , pattern HIV-specific immune response associate control HIV upon discontinuation antiretroviral drug analytical therapeutic interruption . Participants treatment-naive adult acute early HIV infection choose start start anti-HIV drug begin study . NOTE : In August 2007 notify manufacturer candidate vaccine longer make vaccine , vaccine would longer available . Unfortunately participant receive either vaccine placebo conclude anything efficacy . No safety problem occur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlling Acute Early HIV Infection With Antiretroviral Drugs , Without Candidate Vaccine.As Reported Previously , Candidate Vaccie Was Not Provided Maufacturer Promised</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In HIV patient acute early infection , effective long-term immunological control HIV occur , indicate HIV cause irreparable damage , immune system able mount effective immune response HIV . However , unknown immune system patient acute early infection able develop maintain effective memory CD4 immune response . In HIV patient , destruction CD4 cell ever-weakening immune system lead progression HIV disease . HIV-1 immunogen whole kill gp120-depleted HIV vaccine compose HIV-1 isolate ( HZ321 ) serum collect patient Zaire 1976 . The vaccine contain protein HIV subtypes A G. By inject particle HIV infect people , immune system may stimulate mount great immune response kill HIV particle vaccine also real virus particle HIV infect cell people . Also , HIV-1 immunogen base whole inactivated virus , may stimulate broad immune response capable suppress diverse HIV strain currently available vaccine preparation base single subunit proteins HIV . This study plan evaluate safety efficacy therapeutic HIV vaccine , HIV-1 immunogen , conjunction STIs , control HIV infection acute early infection . Participants antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) -naive choose either start start ART study . Participants elect start start ART start study . Those participant choose begin ART receive intervention study follow entire length study . Those participant choose begin ART start take study-approved ART Step 1 study . Only patient viral load less 50 copies/ml Week 24 proceed Step 2 ; patient begin ART continue study-approved ART receive vaccination course study . Step 2 STI part study . In Step 2 , patient stop ART randomly assign receive therapeutic vaccine placebo injection three timepoints : start Step 2 12 24 week start Step 2 . Injections give patient ART least 48 week ; patient receive assign injection 36 week first viral load read less 50 copies/ml . A patient enter Step 3 restart ART minimum 8 week Step 2 end , patient 's viral load le 400 copies/ml CD4 count great 250 cells/ml . Entry Step 4 , include additional retreatment revaccination , may necessary participant , depend individual immune response study-given ART injection . The ART participant study receive either study-provided ART another approve ART ; however , study-provided ART provide study . Viral load CD4 count closely monitor guide retreatment revaccination necessary . Blood collection occur visit . A physical exam occur visit . Urine collection quality life adherence questionnaire occur select visit . NOTE : In August 2007 notify manufacturer candidate vaccine longer make vaccine , vaccine would longer available . Unfortunately participant receive either vaccine placebo conclude anything efficacy . No safety problem occur .</detailed_description>
