	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Calcitriol may cause solid tumor cell look like normal cell , grow spread slowly . Ketoconazole dexamethasone may help calcitriol work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving calcitriol together ketoconazole dexamethasone may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose calcitriol give together ketoconazole dexamethasone treat patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose calcitriol administer ketoconazole dexamethasone patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor . Secondary - Determine tolerability toxic effect regimen patient . - Determine tumor response patient treat regimen . - Determine pharmacokinetics calcitriol dexamethasone without ketoconazole patient . - Determine pharmacodynamics regimen , term CYP24 expression activity vitamin D receptor expression peripheral blood mononuclear cell , patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study calcitriol . Patients receive oral dexamethasone twice daily begin day 0 oral ketoconazole 3 time daily begin day 4 . Patients also receive oral calcitriol daily day 1-3 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos calcitriol maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
