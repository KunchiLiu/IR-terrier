	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well vorinostat work treat patient progressive recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . Drugs use chemotherapy , vorinostat , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vorinostat may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving vorinostat surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving surgery may kill remain tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy vorinostat ( SAHA ) , term 6-month progression-free survival , patient progressive recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . II . Determine safety toxicity drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . II . Determine biologic effect drug target tissue , include primary tumor tissue , patient . III . Correlate genetic alteration tumor response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord plan surgery ( yes [ stratum 1 ] v [ stratum 2 ] ) number prior chemotherapy regimens progressive/recurrent disease ( ≤ 1 [ stratum 1A ] v ≥ 2 [ stratum 1B ] ) . STRATUM 1 : Patients receive oral vorinostat ( SAHA ) twice daily 2 week . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ( undergoing surgery ) STRATUM 2 : Beginning 3 day prior surgery , patient receive oral SAHA twice daily total 6 dos . Patients undergo surgery remove tumor . Beginning within 1-4 week surgery , patient receive oral SAHA twice daily 2 week . ( undergoing surgery ) Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
