	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 6-month survival patient locally advance metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma treat AZD2171 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I . Determine tumor response time progression patient treat drug . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . III . Correlate biological marker response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR . Patients experience disease progression within 5 year completion study treatment may receive additional course study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-44 patient accrue study within 22 month .</detailed_description>
