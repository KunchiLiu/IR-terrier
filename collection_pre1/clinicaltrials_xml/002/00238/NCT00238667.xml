	<brief_title>To Determine Feasibility Clinical Trial Comparing Anticoagulants Versus Antiplatelets Acute Treatment Patients With Cervical Artery Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ST. GEORGE 'S HEADED NOTEPAPER CADISS FEASIBILITY STUDY ( Cervical Artery Dissection Stroke Study ) PROTOCOL Aim : To determine feasibility clinical trial compare antiplatelet therapy anticoagulation acute treatment patient cervical artery dissection . Specifically address whether : 1 . There sufficient clinical endpoint provide power determine treatment effect ; 2 . Adequate number patient recruit . Dissection carotid vertebral artery major cause stroke person &lt; 50 year age , mainly due embolism clot seal tear . At present physician treat patient anticoagulant antiplatelet drug prevent stroke , neither therapy evidence-based . Anticoagulants may powerful anti-embolic agent also dangerous aspirin , potentially could encourage dissection . Most published study flaw retrospective data , reference number patient original study cohort include critical principle randomisation 'blinding ' . Proposal present 'feasibility'study : The prospective data available ( 1 ) suggest anticoagulant effective antiplatelet agent reduce TIA stroke dissection , number small lack reliable statistical confirmation . This study randomise control trial therefore may open bias selection treatment . As well , find recurrent event occur within first month thereafter number tail . A total 1800 patient two arm therapeutical trial necessary calculate data . Authors previous Cochrane review ( 2 ) review available publish literature calculate total 2000 patient ( 1000 treatment arm ) need blind randomised trial anticoagulant versus antiplatelet agent . This would need major , probably international , study involve 50 centre , would expensive undertaking . Prior start study important determine whether would feasible . This particularly important carotid vertebral dissection frequently miss diagnosis , least acute phase . Limited natural history outcome data suggest risk recurrent stroke TIA follow carotid vertebral dissection markedly raise first week month ( 1 , 3 ) therefore early identification recruitment patient essential treatment effect demonstrate . For reason , feasibility study essential large scale clinical trial . Specifically , two thing need determine . Firstly , whether sufficient number patient recruit sufficiently early participating centre . Secondly , view limit data rate recurrent TIA stroke patient recent dissection , need data obtain robust estimate early risk inform power calculation large scale study . A preliminary informal survey conduct Clinical Neurosciences , St. George 's University London , association Association British Neurologists , indicate least 27 neurologists/stroke physician throughout UK would interest collaborate enrol consecutive consenting patient study compare anticoagulation antiplatelet therapy . Methods : This randomise multicentre single blind study compare antiplatelet therapy anticoagulation patient carotid vertebral dissection . Recruitment must within seven day onset symptom . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Extracranial carotid vertebral artery dissection symptom onset within last 7 day . This include : 1 . Ipsilateral TIA stroke 2 . Ipsilateral Horner 's syndrome neck pain know date onset 2 . Imaging evidence definite probable dissection magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) /magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) , compute tomography angiography ( CTA ) ultrasound ( patient initially randomise ultrasound alone subsequent MR CTA confirmation need ) Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Intracranial cerebral artery dissection 2 . Symptom onset 7 day 3 . Contraindications either antiplatelet agent anticoagulation therapy 4 . Patient refusal consent 5 . Patients undergo angioplasty stenting surgery treatment dissection Treatment : Patients randomise either antiplatelet anticoagulation therapy allocate single blind basis continue six month . 1 . Antiplatelet therapy : Aspirin 75-300 mg daily , aspirin dipyridamole clopidogrel alone 2 . Anticoagulation heparin ( either unfractionated heparin therapeutic dose low molecular weight heparin ) follow warfarin aim INR range 2.5-4 . Local protocol heparin therapy use . Primary Endpoint : Ipsilateral stroke , transient ischaemic attack vascular death within 6 month randomisation Secondary Endpoint : 1 . TIA stroke cerebral vascular territory 2 . Recanalisation repeat image 6 month . Imaging Protocol : The diagnosis dissection base different modality different centre . Centres use usual imaging protocol diagnose dissection . Diagnosis basis MRI cross-sectional imaging artery wall , MRA , CT angiography , intra-arterial angiography , ultrasound ( later confirm MR CTA ) acceptable . Patients randomise HQ radiologist ( Dr. Clifton ) agree diagnosis probable definite . Hard copy image must record central reading . The primary analysis include patient judge probable definite dissection central read hard copy . Randomisation : Randomisation via 24 hour randomisation service provide University Aberdeen Health Services Research Unit . The local investigator personally contact service 0800 387 4444 Centre give investigator code number , know randomisation centre local investigator . Trial Management : The study coordinate Clinical Neuroscience St. George 's , University London . The principal co-investigators Professor John Norris Professor Hugh Markus . The principal neuroradiological investigator , responsible assessment hard copy image , Dr Andrew Clifton . The trial coordinate clinical fellow fund project grant The Stroke Association .
