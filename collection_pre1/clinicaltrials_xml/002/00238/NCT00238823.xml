It also determine predictor would make u say one patient would well serve one technique another describe overall acute success rate 6-month recurrence rate cryo ablation compare know success rate RFA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cryoablation Versus Radiofrequency Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryotherapy ( Cryo ) new ablation energy source use instead radiofrequency ( RFA ) method ablation septal pathway . In past year , use cryo approximately 50 time , however 50 % cryo procedure cross RFA cryo cryo RFA . It appear cryo use adjunct therapy RFA instead replacement RFA . I would like describe use cryo cross use RFA cryo . I would like determine predictor would make u say one patient would well serve one technique another . I would also describe overall acute success rate 6-month recurrence rate cryo ablation compare know success rate RFA . All do chart review . This do retrospective study .</detailed_description>
