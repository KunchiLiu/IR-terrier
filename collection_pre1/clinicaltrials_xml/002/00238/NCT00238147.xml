	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , carboplatin , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Capecitabine may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving combination chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose docetaxel give together carboplatin capecitabine follow chemoradiotherapy treating patient undergo surgery locally advanced esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity docetaxel administer carboplatin capecitabine neoadjuvant induction therapy patient locally advanced esophageal cancer . Secondary - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect regimen patient . - Determine clinical pathological response patient treat neoadjuvant induction therapy comprise docetaxel , carboplatin , capecitabine follow chemoradiotherapy capecitabine . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study docetaxel . - Induction therapy : Patients receive docetaxel IV carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos docetaxel maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Approximately 7 day completion induction therapy , patient proceed chemoradiotherapy . - Chemoradiotherapy : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-42 undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , day 1-40 . - Surgery : Approximately 4-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient undergo surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 18 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
