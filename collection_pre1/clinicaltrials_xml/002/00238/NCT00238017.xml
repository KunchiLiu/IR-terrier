	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Amodiaquine Amodiaquine-Artesunate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria remain major cause morbidity mortality among child sub-Saharan Africa . Current malaria control largely consist rapid treatment patient . Amodiaquine-artesunate combinatory treatment regimes include amodiaquine introduce first-line antimalarial drug several African country . However , data efficacy safety amodiaquine amodiaquine-artesunate scarce . In addition , evidence common genetic host factor , e.g . sickle cell trait , may influence efficacy safety drug . To examine efficacy safety name drug well potential influence genetic host factor outcomes randomize , double blind trial among 400 child uncomplicated malaria perform northern Ghana .</detailed_description>
