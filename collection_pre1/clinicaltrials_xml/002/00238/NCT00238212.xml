	<brief_title>S0514 Sorafenib Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Gallbladder Cancer Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective response probability ( complete response partial response ) BAY 43-9006 patient unresectable metastatic gallbladder cholangiocarcinoma . II . To assess overall survival , time treatment failure progression-free survival patient . III . To assess quantitative qualitative toxicity regimen . IV . To evaluate preliminary fashion relevant prognostic predictive molecular marker clinical outcome gallbladder cholangiocarcinoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
