	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Advanced Recurrent Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient advance recurrent uterine cancer treat sorafenib . II . Determine toxic effect drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord histology ( carcinoma v carcinosarcoma ) . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
