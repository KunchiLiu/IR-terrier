	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC stage IIIB malignant pleural effusion stage IV fail therapy least standard first line chemotherapy regimen , intolerant standard chemotherapy . Patients may nonmeasurable disease , measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan ) . Patients asymptomatic treat brain metastasis eligible last receive therapy ( include steroid ) &gt; 4 week study entry felt low likelihood rapid deterioration brain metastasis . Patients must least 1 prior systemic therapy NSCLC , show intolerance chemotherapy . Patients may receive prior therapy bexarotene , ZD1839 , erlotinib ( Tarceva ) . At least 4 week must elapse time major surgery patient must recover effect significant procedure . A three week interval must elapse last dose chemotherapy ( 30 day investigational therapy ) , prior begin protocol therapy ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . Palliative radiotherapy bony sit disease allow trial time enrollment provide patient significant side effect radiotherapy . Age &gt; = 18 year . Life expectancy &gt; 2 month . ECOG performance status 02 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum ß HCG sensitivity least 50 mlU/L ) within 7 day prior initiation treatment must use 2 reliable form effective contraception use simultaneously sexually abstinent least 4 week prior negative pregnancy test entry study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Retinoid class agent know teratogen . Female patient male patient female partner childbearing potential must agree sexual abstinence practice 2 reliable form effective contraception use simultaneously entire period bexarotene capsule treatment least 1 month treatment discontinue . Male patient must agree use condom female sexual partner , may become , pregnant . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; = 3,000/ul absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/ul platelet &gt; = 100,000/ul total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; = 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR calculate creatinine clearance &gt; = 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal triglyceride cholesterol level within normal limit `` normalize '' medication Patients may take follow agent , caution due interaction P450 metabolism : dexamethasone , protease inhibitor , ketoconazole azole antifungal , erythromycin macrolides antibiotic , grapefruit juice , retinoid class drug , betacarotene compound , agent enhance insulin secretion sensitivity . They may take phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampicin , barbiturate , St. John 's Wort study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Insulin dependent diabetes Thyroid disease Patients may chemotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study must recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Palliative radiotherapy allow bony site disease . Patients may receive investigational agent receive within 30 day prior day 1 study . Patients know symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis , treat , asymptomatic brain metastasis eligible prove required therapy include steroid least 4 week . Patients history allergic reaction sensitivity attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition bexarotene ZD1839 exclude . Patients triglyceride cholesterol level within normal limit `` normalize '' medication exclude . Patients exclude uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients another active malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer exclude . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude . Patients risk factor pancreatitis excluded history pancreatitis , significant alcohol consumption factor deem put high risk . Patients take systemic vitamin A dose exceed 15,000 IU/day within 14 day study entry exclude . Patients unwilling minimize exposure ultraviolet light ( sunlight ) bexarotene exclude . Patients MAY NOT TAKE GEMFIBROZIL study due interaction bexarotene Patients may take phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampicin , barbiturate , St John 's Wort study . Patients evidence clinically active interstitial lung disease exclude ( patient chronic stable radiographic change asymptomatic need exclude )</criteria>
