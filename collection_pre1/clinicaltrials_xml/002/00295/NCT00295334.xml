	<brief_title>Moderate Alcohol Intake Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Successful long-term control hyperglycemia decrease risk diabetic complication . Although family history diabetes establish risk factor type 2 diabetes , lifestyle factor also play important role cause . However , physician poorly inform patient â€™ alcohol use affect risk management diabetes . Moderate alcohol consumption associate low risk cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes , also link low cardiovascular risk among type 2 diabetic . Potential mechanism focus primarily lipid metabolism , coagulation , fibrinolysis , insulin sensitivity . A recent systematic review literature assess effect alcohol consumption risk management complication diabetes mellitus suggests moderate alcohol consumption associate decrease risk diabetes , whereas heavy alcohol consumption may associate increase risk . Our aim ass effect moderate alcohol intake glycemic control cardiovascular disease mediator among patient type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
