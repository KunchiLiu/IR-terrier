	<detailed_description>RANDOMIZED TRIAL ON EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF THE ANTENATAL RESCUE COURSE OF GLUCOCORTCOID IN THREATENED PREMATURE BIRTH ( ACG trial ) Introduction Prematurity main cause neonatal mortality morbidity . Immature infants many serious disease respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) , intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) , chronic lung disease ( CLD ) , necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) . Corticosteroids maturational effect fetal cardiovascular , respiratory , nervous gastrointestinal system ( 1 ) . Antenatal corticosteroid ( ANC ) widely use prevention RDS serious disease preterm infant since 1972 ’ , control trial antepartum glucocorticoid treatment publish . Administration 12 mg betamethasone give twice intramuscularly 24 hour apart show effective ( 2,3,4,39 ) . Strong evidence exists neonatal benefit complete course ANC start 24 hour last 7 day treatment ( 2,39 ) . Betamethasone dexamethasone similar biological activity associate significant reduction risk RDS , betamethasone significant decrease neonatal mortality . The clinical benefit document beyond 7 day onset ANC therapy . ( 1,2 ) Several randomize study show single course antenatal corticosteroid treatment improve survival preterm infant bear 24-34 week gestation decrease incidence RDS , ICH NEC . ANC therapy reduces incidence RDS approximately 50 % . ( 1,2 ) ANC treatment also reduce need exogenous surfactant ( 4 ) . The protective effect RDS think due structural maturation lung , increase surfactant synthesis , improve resistance lung injury improve cardiovascular adaptation . Glucocorticoid speed normal thin gas-exchange wall double capillary loop air sac . ANC thus accelerate structural development respiratory airway , reduces number alveolus . Glucocorticoid increase surfactant synthesis enhance maturation surfactant- produce type II pneumocytes stimulate secretion surfactant complex ( 1,6,7,8,9,40 ) . Serial dos ANC may possibly downregulate steroid receptor result decrease disordered surfactant production . ( ref ) ANC show decrease incidence CLD 28 day age either meta-analysis recent retrospective study ( 2,13,14,15 ) . ANC treatment associate maturation cardiovascular system normalisation low blood pressure small premature infant birth . ( ref ) This influence evident administration surfactant . ( 4 ) According meta-analysis , ANC effect incidence PDA . However several study , use ANC associate increase spontaneous closure PDA ( 2,3,4 , ) . ANC decrease incidence ICH preterm infant ( 2,3,4 ) . Severe prematurity decrease autoregulation cerebral circulation predisposes ICH cerebral ischemia . Glucocorticoids accelerate differentiation neuronal cell possibly enhance maturation germinal matrix vessel ( 1,33,34 ) . ANC therapy associate also low incidence periventricular leukomalacia ( PVL ) cerebral palsy ( CP ) , effect significant Crowley ’ meta-analysis ( 2,3,4,5 ) . In recently publish retrospective study , antenatal administration betamethasone associate decrease risk PVL compare antenatal dexamethasone treatment ( 17 ) . Betamethasone clinically use mixture betamethasone phosphate ( 6 mg ) betamethasone acetate ( 6 mg ) , provide rapid exposure phosphate form sustain exposure acetate form . Maximal fetal serum level betamethasone attain 1-2 hour ANC treatment ( 27 ) . The half life antenatally administer betamethasone 12 hour fetal circulation ( 1,36 ) . Decrease incidence RDS evident ANC administer 24 hour 7 day delivery . However , incidence ICH decrease even treatment initiate less 24 hour prior delivery ( 2,3,4 ) . According animal study short term ANC ( &lt; 24 hour ) improve postnatal lung function , decrease protein leak lung alters postnatal blood pressure regulation premature . ANC also seem augment postnatal neuroendocrine endocrine response hypoxic challenge ( 28,29,30 ) . According meta-analysis significant decrease birthweight physical psychological development age 3-12 year follow single course ANC treatment fetus ( 2,18,19 ) . According follow-up study , prenatal single course steroid treatment safe enhance survival associate high incidence disability developmental disturbance survivor childhood young adulthood ( 2,3,5,18,19,35 ) . Single course ANC treatment increase risk fetal neonatal infection incidence maternal infection ( 2 ) . When administered subclinical chorioamnionitis , ANC treatment seem decrease incidence RDS , ICH , PVL neonatal mortality without apparent increase neonatal sepsis ( 32 ) . However , concern possible negative effect multiple course ANC birthweight , head circumference growth later childhood . Data numerous animal study suggest ANC negative effect pre- postnatal growth . Most study deal rodent short gestation period growth ( 10,11,12,37 ) . In animal study multidose ANC exposure also decrease lung growth , seem irreversible persistent adulthood ( 10,11,12 ) . Also , several animal study ANC exposure show decreased brain growth cell proliferation , may also due short duration gestation long duration exposure ( 10,11,12,37 ) . There concern potential suppressive effect ANC fetal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis . Transient suppression pituitary-adrenal gland preterm infant whose mother receive 1-2 dos antenatal glucocorticoid , reportedly recovers within 7 day life ( 23,24,25,26,36 ) . Infants deliver shortly one course ANC normally responsive stress birth ( e.g . RDS asphyxia ) . ( 36 ) Clinical practice administer antenatal corticosteroid varies greatly individual center late 1990 ’ . The practice repeat course ANC become widespread . However safety efficacy serial course glucocorticoid know . According recently publish non-randomized study conflict data growth neonatal morbidity infant expose single vs. multiple course ANC ( 13,14,15 ) . There also concern particularly woman prolong premature rupture fetal membrane ( PPROM ) repetitive dos may increase maternal fetal infection ( 21,22 ) . In retrospective study multiple course ANC associate increase incidence maternal postpartum infection ( 13 ) . The effect multiple course ANC HPA-axis well know . In recent study mild adrenal suppression evident preterm infant whose mother receive eight course ANC ( 15 ) . It also propose perinatal stress exposure corticosteroid induces long lasting change HPA-axis associate decrease stress induce CRH release adulthood ( 24,34 ) . However , exist data function HPA-axis young adult , expose antenatal corticosteroid fetal life . There insufficient data optimal interval ANC administration . According recent study additive positive effect practice repeat course ANC 7 day interval . However , know positive influence one course ANC evident 7 day administration . It interest whether one additional rescue course ANC give within 24 hour premature delivery effective single course ANC . No prospective study randomize , control trial compare single versus second rescue course antenatal corticosteroid publish . Specific aim hypothesis The present aim study whether recipient ANC single dose betamethasone give shortly spontaneous elective premature birth ( gestation 24 + 0 – 33 + 6 wk ) improve neonatal outcome without cause serious side effect . According protocol , aim start placebo second rescue course ANC 48 hour expect delivery . The first hypothesis state administration second rescue course ANC effective single course ANC increase intact survival term infant without major neonatal morbidity , define protocol . The principal outcome survival premature infant without major morbidity age 36+0 week survival infant born term early neonatal period without major morbidity , define protocol . Study design Present study multicenter , randomize , blind , placebo-controlled trial compare benefit side effect single vs. second rescue course antenatal corticosteroid .
