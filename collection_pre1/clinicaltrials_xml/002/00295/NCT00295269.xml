	<brief_title>Corticosteroids Rescue Therapy Late Phase Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : ARDS affect approximately 150,000 people United States year . Despite twenty year research mechanism cause syndrome numerous development technology mechanical ventilation , mortality rate remain great 50 percent . In addition tragic loss human life , condition pose cost society patient spend average two week intensive care unit require multiple high tech procedure . Because overwhelming nature lung injury establish , prevention appear effective strategy improve outlook ARDS . Basic research identify numerous inflammatory pathway associate development ARDS . Agents block mediator prolong survival animal lung injury , test human patient . Because large number putative mediator variety way action block , possibility new drug development almost infinite . This exciting prospect , since envisions first effective pharmacologic treatment ARDS . However , preliminary clinical study show conflict result , urgent need mechanism efficiently effectively test new drug ARDS . Treatment study patient ARDS difficult perform three reason . First , complicate clinical picture make difficult accumulate large number comparable patient one center . Secondly , agreement optimal supportive care critically ill patient . Finally , many patient meet study criterion enrol study protocol acute nature disease process . For reason , therapeutic trial ARDS require multicenter cooperation . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study compare effect corticosteroid placebo management late-phase ( great seven day ) ARDS . The study determine administration corticosteroid , methylprednisolone sodium succinate , severe ARDS either stable worsen seven day , would reduce mortality morbidity . The primary endpoint mortality 60 day . Secondary endpoint include ventilator-free day organ failure-free day . LaSRS design include 400 patient begin recruit Spring 1997 . In October 1999 , data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) reduce recruitment target number 200 patient eligible patient few anticipate .</detailed_description>
