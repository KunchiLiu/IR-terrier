	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer major health concern Western world estimate lifetime risk 5-6 % . The goal achieve effective cancer prevention drive prediction CRC become leading cause death ( surpass heart disease ) decade , estimate 1,000,000 new case 500,000 death per year , worldwide . Despite continue advance diagnosis therapy , long-term survival rate improve significantly last four decade . Nearly 50 % CRC patient die disease . Preventive strategy offer best hope , least understanding biology cancer mature point implement therapy . The search new chemopreventive compound minimal toxicity raise particular interest phytochemicals.Curcumin ( diferuloylmethane ) natural compound derive rhizome Curcuma Longa , East Indian plant , commonly call turmeric . It show possess potent anti-inflammatory anti-oxidative property , long history dietary use food additive . Curcumin also potent anti-proliferative effect variety cancer cell line vitro , stem ability modulate many intracellular signal transduction pathway . Human phase I-II study find curcumin safe , indicate dose-limiting toxicity take mouth dos 10 g/day . This data , together dismal therapeutic option available colon cancer patient , suggest curcumin warrant investigation set . The present study evaluate gemcitabine combination curcumin celecoxib patient colon cancer .</brief_summary>
