	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis knee hip joint common condition ; knee osteoarthritis affect 6 % adult 30 year age osteoarthritis hip affect 3 % 6 % Caucasian population . Both form osteoarthritis associate disability . Conventional treatment ( analgesic use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory , NSAIDS ) prophylactic , aim decrease pain improve function . However long term use NSAIDS associate high incidence adverse event ( gastrointestinal tract symptom ) . A safe alternative treatment would therefore beneficial . Both anecdotal evidence recent study implicate potential herbal remedy Devil 's Claw ( Harpagophytum procumbens ) treatment painful , chronic arthritic type condition ( Ernst Chrubasik , 2000 ) . Devil 's Claw extract obtain root Harpagophytum procumbens plant , member sesame family find Kalahari region South Africa . It show herbal remedy anti-inflammatory analgesic effect ( Baghdikian et al , 1997 ) . Currently Devil 's Claw market use supportive treatment degenerative arthrosis , Medicines Control Agency license product freely available general public health food store pharmacy . The objective study assess efficacy , optimum dosage safety herbal remedy Devil 's Claw ( Harpagophytum ) treatment osteoarthritis knee and/or hip . The primary objective study investigate follow three principal question : 1 . To compare efficacy Devil 's Claw placebo treatment osteoarthritis knee and/or hip 2 . To determine optimum dose Devil 's Claw 3 . To evaluate safety tolerability three dose Devil 's Claw treatment osteoarthritis knee/hip compare placebo There also number secondary research objective also address ( see later ) . These objective base follow hypothesis : Hypotheses - Devil 's Claw anti-inflammatory property ( assess reduction pain , stiffness disability aspect WOMAC ) chronic osteoarthritis knee and/or hip 16 week treatment , compare placebo . - A dose response effect exist treatment osteoarthritis knee/hip Devil 's Claw .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : Randomized , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging two-centre study PREPARATIONS FOR INVESTIGATION : Devil 's Claw ( AllyaÂ® ) /placebo tablet STATISTICAL METHODS : Analysis intention treat basis . The following test perform statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 : Primary efficacy analysis : The primary outcome reduction WOMAC total score baseline week 16 . The week 16 mean four treatment group compare use analysis covariance take account baseline assessment demographic difference , age , gender , etc , find significant . Multiple comparison test use examine specific difference initially specify interest , two high dos Devil 's Claw versus placebo . Secondary Efficacy Analysis : Similar analysis covariance use examine treatment group differences week 16 compare baseline WOMAC subscales ( pain , stiffness physical function ) , Quality Life assessment ( SF-36 ) . Changes subject 's well-being overall global assessment compare use appropriate non-parametric test , e.g . Mann-Whitney test MacNemar 's test . Changes attitudes health belief CAM assess use Chi-Squared test . Safety Evaluation : Group differences adverse event reporting assess descriptive method . NUMBER OF PATIENTS : 264 ( 50 patient group , expect total 64 drop-outs ) NUMBER OF SITES : 2 TIME SCHEDULE : Study Start : April 2004 Study End : March 2007 Observation period/patient : 20 week</detailed_description>
