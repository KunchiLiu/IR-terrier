	<brief_title>N2004-04 : Fenretinide LXS Treating Patients With Recurrent , Refractory , Persistent Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose fenretinide ( 4-HPR ) Lym-X-Sorb™ ( LXS ) oral powder ( 4-HPR/LXS oral powder ) patient recurrent , refractory , persistent neuroblastoma . - Define toxicity 4-HPR/LXS oral powder patient . - Determine plasma pharmacokinetics 4-HPR/LXS oral powder metabolites patient . - Determine tolerability combination ketoconazole 4-HPR/LXS oral powder patient . Secondary - Determine response rate patient treat 4-HPR/LXS oral powder . - Determine level 4-HPR/LXS oral powder normal peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) tumor cell surrogate tissue . - Determine plasma level 4-HPR/LXS oral powder give combination ketoconazole . - Determine whether ketoconazole increase 4-HPR/LXS oral powder plasma level . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study fenretinide ( 4-HPR ) Lym-X-Sorb™ ( LXS ) oral powder , follow open-label study . Patients sequentially assign 1 2 intervention group . - Group I : Patients receive 4-HPR/LXS oral powder 3 time daily day 0-6 . - Group II : Patients receive 4-HPR/LXS oral powder group I oral ketoconazole daily day 0-6 . In group , treatment repeat every 21 day least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete remission study enrollment may receive 12 course ( 9 month ) therapy . Blood sample collect baseline course 1 , 2 , 6 pharmacokinetic correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 32 patient accrue dose-escalation portion 36 accrue open-label portion study .</detailed_description>
