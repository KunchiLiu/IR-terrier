	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia associate neurocognitive impairment , diminish life satisfaction , lack independence , poor function social , occupational desire expect community role . The personal , social economic cost illness enormous . Neurocognitive deficit ( e.g. , slow thinking , poor attention memory , inadequate problem solve ) recognize core feature illness , primary contributor functional impairment among patient ( Bellack , Gold &amp; Buchanan ; 1999 ; Green , 1996 ) .

Hence , grow interest alternative treatment strategy address cognitive deficit , include computer-assisted cognitive remediation . The purpose project assess efficacy computer-assisted cognitive remediation program develop : Computer Assisted Cognitive Remediation ( CACR ) . Fifty individual schizophrenia relate disorder recruit randomly assign one two condition : ) 36 session CACR ; b ) 36 session manualized computer control condition ( RC ) . The efficacy CACR assess behavioral performance three dimension : ( 1 ) train learn exercise , ( 2 ) neuropsychological measure , ( 3 ) role play base assessment everyday problem solve . We hypothesize CACR effective control treatment domain .</detailed_description>
