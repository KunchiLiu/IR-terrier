	<brief_summary>The study intend individual well HAART therapy . In Step 1 trial , individual give 6 infusion study drug VRX496 see effect viral load CD4 count . If individual serious adverse effect infusion VRX496 viral load CD4 count remain stable , may go Step 2 study . In Step 2 , individual stop take HAART medication viral load , CD4 count number VRX496 T cell monitor . All subject receive VRX496 T cell enroll Long-Term Follow-up study monitor subject . Subjects follow every 6 month five year follow 1st infusion T cell . If VRX496 T cell longer find blood five year , subject contact yearly next 10 year . If VRX496 T cell find blood five year 1st infusion T cell , subject continue see year VRX496 T cell longer find blood maximum 15 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV-based antisense vector may provide several important advantage current HIV combination therapy . VIRxSYS Corporation ( VIRxSYS ) develop candidate clinical vector VRX496 . VRX496 HIV-based lentiviral vector contain anti-HIV antisense sequence target HIV envelope ( env ) cod sequence . First , HIV-1 vector likely less toxic current combination drug therapy genetic antisense antiviral express cell become infected wt-HIV . The payload locate upstream major splice acceptor site thus dependent expression Tat Rev proteins provide wt-HIV . Second , length antisense region 900 nucleotide long , make difficult wt-HIV create resistant strain sufficiently fit cause disease . Third , HIV vector predict safe novel genetic sequence introduce patient ( i.e. , novel functional gene contain HIV-1 vector ) . All sequence present vector derive highly conserved region wt-HIV would almost certainly present HIV-1-infected individual . The HIV sequence use create VRX496 solely derive pNL4-3 , prototypic HIV-1 molecular clone derive two North American strain HIV-1 . In present trial , T cell harvest infected individual , transduce ex vivo vector University Pennsylvania , reintroduce autologous transfusion . VIRxSYS recently complete Phase 1 clinical study University Pennsylvania vector VRX496 5 HIV-positive subject fail least two HAART regimen . Data available date primary endpoint , viral load CD4 count , promise . Specifically , 4 5 subject stable increase CD4 count , viral load stable 4 5 patient , decrease 1.7 log 1 5 subject follow single infusion VRX496 T cell . In present trial , subject receive 6 infusion VRX496 modify CD4 T cell , undergo series test , include rectal mucosal biopsy , determine longevity traffic VRX496 T cell . In addition , subject opportunity supervise drug holiday ( structured treatment interruption ) determine VRX496 antiviral effect .</detailed_description>
