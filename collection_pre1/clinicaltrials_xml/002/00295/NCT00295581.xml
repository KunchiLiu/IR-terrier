	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Johns Hopkins University Center Immunization Research Washington DC , test safety immune response healthy volunteer two experimental malaria vaccine . Malaria disease red blood cell cause parasite spread person person mosquito . It affect people age , particularly severe child . Patients may high fever , chill muscle ache . They sometimes severe complication may even result death . The vaccine study call `` transmission blocking '' vaccine . These vaccine stimulate person 's immune system produce antibody malaria . When mosquito bite vaccinate person , ingest person 's blood . The antibody ingest blood stop malaria parasite develop inside mosquito . The mosquito would able transmit malaria people . PpPfs25/ISA51 ( Vaccine A ) stimulate production antibody malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum , ScPvs25/ISA51 ( Vaccine B ) stimulate antibody malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax . The vaccine also contain substance call Montanide ISA51 , boost immune response vaccine . Healthy volunteer 18 50 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Women able become pregnant urine pregnancy test immunization . Participants randomly assign receive two injection , space 4 month apart , either Vaccine A Vaccine B one three doses-high , medium , low . Two subject dose group additionally serve `` control '' receive Montanide ISA51 mixed saline . The vaccine inject muscle upper arm . Subjects monitor 30 minute injection possible side effect take home diary card record temperature symptom may appear next 13 day . A blood sample draw several occasion vaccination check subject 's health evaluate immune response vaccine . At 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 day vaccination , participant come clinic check vital sign ( temperature , pulse , respiration , blood pressure ) , brief physical examination , history symptom since previous visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PpPfs25/ISA51 ScPvs25/ISA51 Vaccines Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase 1 clinical trial evaluate safety , reactogenicity immunogenicity two malaria transmission-blocking vaccine , PpPfs25 ScPvs25 , healthy adult volunteer . Of four specie malaria infect human , Plasmodium falciparum responsible majority death . However , outside Africa , malaria cause Plasmodium vivax ; although case result death , represent major cause morbidity lead significant impact quality life . The development safe effective vaccine prevents transmission P. falciparum P. vivax would important addition current method control spread malaria parasite . A vaccine design prevent oocyst development mosquito elicit transmission-blocking antibody vertebrate host would protect individual vicinity become infected immunized person . Thus , despite immediate role personal protection , transmission-blocking vaccine potentially powerful component multifaceted public health approach control eliminate malaria . This study conduct Johns Hopkins University - Bloomberg School Public Health , Center Immunization Research . Seventy-two healthy male non-pregnant female volunteer age 18-50 enrol . This study single blind ( volunteer ) placebo-controlled . The study evaluate three dose level PpPfs25 ScPvs25 malaria vaccine ( 5 microg , 20 microg , 80 microg ) emulsify Montanide ISA51 compare Montanide ISA51 give alone . Seventy-two volunteer ( 60 vaccine 12 placebo ) enrol assigned one six cohort . In cohort , 10 volunteer receive vaccine 2 receive placebo . Volunteers vaccinate intramuscular injection day 0 120 . The group stagger adequate safety evaluation perform prior dose escalation . The duration study 18 month per volunteer . The primary objective trial ass compare , dose-escalating study , safety reactogenicity PpPfs25 ScPvs25 transmission block vaccine compare adjuvant alone ; assess compare , dose-escalating study , duration antibody response 18 month period volunteer well effect boost second vaccination 4 month .</detailed_description>
