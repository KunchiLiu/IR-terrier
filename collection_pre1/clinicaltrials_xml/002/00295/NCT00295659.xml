	<detailed_description>Title : What optimal method screen diagnosis gestational diabetes ? A randomised clinical trial evaluate incidence GDM , cost-effectiveness clinical outcome use three method . Objectives : 1 ) To evaluate incidence cost-effectiveness screening diagnosis GDM compare three different method . 2 ) To evaluate follow method : population characteristic ; gestational age screening , diagnosis initiation treatment ; maternal neonatal outcome . Rationale : There consensus best method identify case GDM , numerous screen diagnostic procedure employ worldwide . Recently Canadian Guidelines recommend new set value base normative data , yet data validate large population compare diagnostic rate outcomes head head long accept value O ’ Sullivan Mahan . In addition , question cost Canadian healthcare set never address yet significant societal concern . The result study would help clarify issue use evidence-based methodology . Outline : Pregnant woman refer outpatient glucose test GDM give study information sheet obstetrics staff . At time book test remind study arrive fasting . On day glucose testing , research assistant invite patient participate , obtain consent perform randomisation one three group : ( 1 ) 50g screen ± 100g 3h GTT ; ( 2 ) 50g screen ± 75g 2h GTT ; ( 3 ) 75g 2h GTT . During glucose test , study participant also ask information health cost incur process glucose test . If screen GTT need repeat time pregnancy , patient remain study arm originally assign . Interpretation result patient ’ caregiver referral diabetes clinic need continue usual . Data analyse use appropriate bivariate multivariate method GDM incidence , direct indirect cost glucose test , maternal infant outcome . Significance DM : This study evaluate diagnostic efficacy , cost-effectiveness clinical outcome three method . A one-step procedure may better tolerate compare two-step approach respect number visit , amount drink length test . Furthermore , diagnosis single test may avoid unnecessary delay initiation therapy still identify patient risk type 2 DM .</detailed_description>
