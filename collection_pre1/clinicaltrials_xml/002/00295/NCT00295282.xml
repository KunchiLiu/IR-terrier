	<brief_title>A Dose-Escalation Study MDX-1100 Patients With Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study establish safety tolerability single dose MDX-1100 administered dose-escalating cohort patient active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . The secondary objective include : 1. characterize pharmacokinetic profile MDX-1100 , 2. determine pharmacodynamic effect MDX-1100 CXCL10-related surrogate marker , 3. obtain preliminary evidence assess Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index ( DAI ) , 4. determine immunogenic response MDX-1100 , 5. determine safety efficacy repeat dose patient respond single dose MDX-1100 . This Phase I , multicenter , dose-escalation study MDX-1100 ( anti-CXCL10 human monoclonal antibody ) patient UC , define standard clinical , endoscopic histological criterion DAI great equal 4 less equal 9 . Three six patient enter 4 cohort ( 0.3 , 1.0 , 3.0 10mg/kg ) . Starting low dose cohort ( 0.3mg/kg ) , patient administer single dose MDX-1100 Day 1 follow 70 day last dose . Dose escalation may proceed third patient cohort reach Day 29 dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) occur . Dose escalation may proceed sixth patient reach Day 29 &lt; 2 DLTs occur cohort . Dose escalation continue last cohort enrol maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define . Patients respond initial dose , define decrease UC disease activity index ( UCDAI ) great equal 3 point Day 29 compare baseline , offer option receive 3 additional dos MDX-1100 originally assign dose level . Re-dosing permitted time disease flare define worsen modify UCDAI great equal 2 compare prior nadir . In order obtain PK data , first re-dose may administer Day 43 subsequent dos may great equal 28 day apart . A response repeat dose phase define decrease mUCDAI great equal 2 compare previous baseline mUCDAI . For second infusion , comparison use mUCDAI calculate Day 29 subsequent nadir . The study terminate approximately 70 day last patient receive last dose MDX-1100 . It anticipate maximum total time study patient le 1 year .</detailed_description>
