	<brief_title>Nexium 40mg Once Daily v Prevacid 30mg Twice Day Control Severe GERD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>approximately 20 % patient take first generation proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) take standard approve dose . This dosing require attain adequate control gastric intraesophageal pH order affect desire clinical improvement . It recognize b.i.d dose strategy increase intragastric pH control &lt; 4 approximately 12 hour almost 16 hour . The refinement S isomer omeprazole ( Nexium ) lead way effectively control acid exposure . Comparative trial PPIs show significantly great pH control &lt; 4 head head comparison well recent crossover study . One study suggest Nexium dosing contain approximately 16.5 hour pH control &lt; 4 . Conceivably , duration pH control suggest b.i.d . dose PPIs might avoid . Furthermore , suggest patient currently take b.i.d . PPIs might successful candidate conversion q.d . Nexium . This would provide considerable cost implication health care plan patient responsible pay PPI therapy . To date , esomeprazole study comparison b.i.d . dose PPIs . There pharmacologic evidence suggest , however , comparable . In proposed study , believe begin patient well control make clean definition high likelihood demonstrate efficacy .</detailed_description>
