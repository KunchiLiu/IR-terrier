	<brief_summary>Patients diagnose thyroid cancer commonly treat surgery remove thyroid gland follow radioiodine ablation destroy remain part thyroid gland may miss surgery . It think ablation radioiodine destroy normal remain thyroid tissue well cancerous cell either thyroid area site . Following successful treatment , patient monitor physician regular interval test detect recurrence thyroid cancer throughout body . If thyroid cell detect follow test , physician decide best method re-treat patient . In 2001-2003 Genzyme conduct clinical study test Thyrogen® use accomplish radioiodine ablation treatment . This study aim determine success rate radioiodine ablation comparable patient prepared ablation Thyrogen® maintain normal thyroid hormone therapy , , alternatively , thyroid hormone withdrawal . Thyroid hormone withdrawal commonly cause uncomfortable side effect patient , might avoid use Thyrogen . Eight month initial Thyrogen plus radioiodine treatment achieve ablation , patient group give Thyrogen® test remain thyroid tissue . The result test show patient ( group ) successfully achieve remnant ablation detectable thyroid tissue remain . In order confirm remnant ablation result conduct follow testing study patient enrol previous study also determine thyroid cancer recur . Only patient complete previous Thyrogen ablation study eligible entry study .</brief_summary>
