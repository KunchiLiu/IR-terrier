	<brief_title>Evaluation Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry System Versus Standard Loop Event Monitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac monitoring use diagnose patient symptom . Holter monitor cardiac loop monitoring test ofter prescribed patient depend frequency symptom . If symptom occur daily , Holter may prescribe , symptoms become less frequent diagnostic yield Holter monitoring decline greatly . The current yield approximately 5-10 % depend indication . When Holter long option patient infrequent symptom cardiac loop event monitor prescribe make diagnosis . The yield monitoring also average approximately 25-35 % . We feel yield Mobile Cardiac Ouptatient Telemetry ( MCOT ) service proviced CardioNet significantly high due fact every beat analyze use algorithm many time arrhythmia cause symptom end patient able press button loop monitor record ECG . This study compare MCOT service Patients 18 year age experience syncope , near syncope palpitation less frequently daily . Require 24 hour non-diagnostic ECG monitoring prior randomization . Patients remain monitoring 30 day unless arrhythmia diagnosis make . The primary endpoint confirmation exclusion probable arrhythmic cause pre-syncope , syncope palpitation experience subject prior enrollment study . Secondary endpoint include time diagnosis , time detection clinically significant arrhythmia , comparison non-clinicaly significant arrhythmia , rate asymptomatic arrhythmia clinically non clinically significant diagnosis relate resource utilization . The study size 300 subject .</detailed_description>
