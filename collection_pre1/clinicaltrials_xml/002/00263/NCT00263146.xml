	<brief_summary>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrom associate lung systemic inflammation , could worsen mechanical ventilation.This include proteasis - antiproteasis imbalance could participate fibrosis process . Low tidal-volume ventilation ( 6 mL/kg ) low plateau pressure ( &lt; 30 cm H2O ) prove decrease mortality compare conventionnal high-volume ( 12 mL/kg ) ventilation.Moreover , lung-protective approach decrease lung annd systemic inflammation . Using recruitment maneuver ( i.e . application short time high pressure intention re-open lung , follow increase PEEP-level keep lung open , attempt decrease alveolar shear-stress ) propose improve oxygen reduce bio-trauma . However , effect maneuver inflammatory response evolution ARDS remain unknown . Therefore planned randomize , monocentric , controlled trial consist comparison two approach mechanical ventilation Acute Lung Injury . This trial include 30 hemodynamically stable patient fulfil ALI ARDS criterion define US European Consensus Conference . They randomize two group : standard low-volume ventilation vs. recruitment maneuver . The main objective study compare ventilatory strategy term lung systemic inflammation . The primary outcome measure proteasis activity measure broncho alveolar fluid ( BAL ) pro- antiinflammatory cytokine activity measure BAL blood . Two sample ( BAL blood ) obtain 48-72 hour interval . In recruitment maneuver group , first BAL obtain two hour maneuver . Secondary outcome measure gaz exchange , respiratory mechanic , systemic hemodynamics visceral dysfunction score .</brief_summary>
