	<brief_summary>This study determine whether experimental medicine , STA-5326 mesylate , safe use patient common variable immunodeficiency ( CVID ) inflammation gut . It also determine patient take drug show improvement symptom , decrease inflammatory chemical gut , change immune cell , improvement gut function absorb food . Patients 18 75 year age CVID chronic diarrhea involuntary weight loss 5 percent past body weight past 12 month may eligible study . Candidates screen review medical record , medical history physical examination , blood , urine stool test , chest x-rays skin test exposure tuberculosis , hydrogen breath test . For latter , breath sample collect every 20 minute ( 2 hour ) subject drink sugar solution . This test determine digestive effect bacteria upper intestine . Samples collect subject blow balloon . Participants undergo follow test procedure : Immune System Gastrointestinal Evaluation - 48-hour stool fat collection ( measure amount undigested fat stool ) : Subjects keep diary eat 48-hour period . At begin 48 hour take two dye capsule take another two capsule 48 hour later . They collect stool sample pas second set capsule bowel movement . An additional 24-hour stool collection test loss protein stool . - D-xylose absorption test ( measure ability gut absorb nutrient ) : Subjects drink solution d-xylose ( sugar substitute ) . Blood sample collect 1 hour drinking solution . - Upper endoscopy : A thin flexible light tube advance mouth evaluate esophagus , stomach begin small intestine . - Lower endoscopy : A thin flexible light tube advance rectum evaluate colon . Treatment Period ( Study day 1 57 ) - Physical examination - study day 1 , 8 , 15 , 29 , 43 57 - Blood sample test level STA-5326 blood . On study day 1 57 , sample collect medication dose 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 8 hour dose ; day 29 , one sample collect medication dose . - Blood sample routine safety test - study day 1 , 8 , 15 , 29 , 43 57 - Medication history - study day 1 , 8 , 15 , 29 , 43 57 - Interview pain , discomfort , well - study day 1 , 8 , 15 , 29 , 43 57 - Pregnancy test woman become pregnant - study day 15 , 43 , 57 - D-xylose absorption test - study day 29 57 - Electrocardiogram - study day 29 57 - Urine test - study day 29 57 - Blood test research immune cell - study day 57 - Repeat endoscopy study gut function ( 24- 48-hour stool collection ) Follow-up period ( Day 85 day 113 ) -Physical examination , blood test , medication history , question pain , discomfort well</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STA-5326 Meslylate Treat Gut Inflammation Associated With Common Variable Immunodeficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess toxicity oral IL-12/23 inhibitor STA-5326 mesylate subject common variable immunodeficiency ( CVID ) associate symptomatic gastrointestinal inflammation . Common variable immunodeficiency clinically heterogeneous disorder characterize decreased serum immunoglobulin IgG IgA level . In addition chronic recurrent pyogenic sino-pulmonary infection , many patient develop non-infectious gastrointestinal manifestation disable fatal . Currently standard therapy associate gastrointestinal disease outside empiric nutritional intervention weight loss non-specific anti-diarrheal agent . Recently gut inflammation complicate CVID characterize Th1 inflammatory response , excess cytokine production associate diarrhea weight loss well reduce D-xylose absorption steatorrhea . This protocol represent first attempt test specific anti-IL-12 therapy patient group ; previously show therapy target IL-12/23 successfully treat Th1 gut inflammation Crohn 's disease . While protocol design measure safety STA-5326 mesylate CVID patient , also measure effect symptom , gut function , expression immune cell surface marker production cytokine blood gut mucosal mononuclear cell . CVID patient gastrointestinal symptom malabsorption , maldigestion , chronic diarrhea enrol study . Subjects ( total 10 individual ) receive STA-5326 mesylate 100 mg per o ( PO ) daily ( QD ) ( equivalent 70 mg STA-5326 free base ) 8 week . Subjects pretreatment end-of-study procedure , include upper low endoscopy , measure change immune response physiologic measure gut function , well routine safety monitor throughout treatment period . Variables include safety ( adverse event rate ) , clinical ( weight , stool frequency , result gut absorption test ) , laboratory ( lymphocyte cytokine assay ) parameter descriptive summary statistical analysis ( n , mean , median , standard deviation , minimum maximum range ) .</detailed_description>
