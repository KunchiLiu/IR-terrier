	<brief_summary>The thymus know site T cell development human . Due location chest front heart , incidental thymecomy commonly perform cardiothoracic surgery , especially infants child , surgeon may gain access surgical field . This practice consider safe thought thymus inactive birth . However , recent data use newly develop technique demonstrate thymus normally active well adulthood . In addition , previous study ( UCLA IRB # 02-03-008-02 ) demonstrate alteration lymphocyte ( T cell ) number individual undergone thymectomy childhood know immunity affect . We plan investigate immune development immune function later life affect loss T cell production cause thymectomy cardiothoracic surgical procedure childhood . At UCLA , large number patient see congenital heart disease undergo surgical procedure correction repair many child adult follow many year undergone surgical procedure . Subjects study recruit among patient . We propose study examine number activity lymphocyte obtain blood sample child young adult subject undergone surgery early childhood . We determine subject complete thymectomy past use CT MRI ( obtain routine care ) , subject cardiothoracic surgery , visualization thymic tissue procedure . In addition give vaccination common viral illness ( hepatitis A ) measure immune response ( blood sample ) . As part study , ask medical information consist history congenital cardiac disease diagnosis ( asthma ) , history infection hospitalization , information immunization . We also ask list specific symptom give u information function immune system .</brief_summary>
