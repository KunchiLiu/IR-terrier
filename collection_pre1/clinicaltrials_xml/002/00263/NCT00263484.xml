	<brief_title>Higher Frequency Zoledronic Acid Treatment Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma ( MM ) may treat use monthly cycle dexamethasone plus thalidomide ( DT ) . Unfortunately , use conventional dos DT associate significant treatment-related morbidity mortality , comparable observed conventional chemotherapy . Hence , safety reason , patient frequently receive low conventional dos DT ( i.e . dt ) , potentially experience poor anti-MM effect . The highly-potent aminobisphosphonate , zoledronic acid ( Z ) , show pre-clinical mouse model exhibit impressive anti-MM effect . It therefore possible combined dt Z ( i.e . dtZ ) enhance efficacy ( low dose ) dt . In addition , anti-tumor effect dtZ may potentially augment use Z high ( three-weekly ) dose frequency .</detailed_description>
