	<brief_title>Homing Health : Study Home Delivered Chronic Disease Self Management Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Key reason `` quality chasm '' current ideal chronic illness care health care system insensitive patient preference , provider-driven , disease-focused . By contrast , common goal among propose patient-centered care model foster continuous heal relationship patient health care system . Such relationship allow patient receive care time via variety communication medium , rather via periodic office visit . Home health care foster relationship improve outcome patient variety condition . Home intervention may particularly useful care grow number people chronic illness accompany functional limitation reduce access community-based intervention group self-care class . However , trial compare effectiveness wide array home care model limit , mechanism underlie effectiveness remain unclear . This randomize control trial ( RCT ) 3 group , compare effectiveness cost-effectiveness 2 different home-based care model usual care improve chronic illness outcome , address research gap . The primary outcome health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) . We also explore mechanism effectiveness home care influence self-efficacy - belief patient ability successfully execute action require achieve value health outcome - adherence . The chronic illness target diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , asthma , arthritis , depression . The home care delivery medium model in-person visit , standard telephone call . The study hypothesis : ) Each 3 different home intervention result improvement patient self-efficacy , adherence care , HRQoL compare usual care differ statistically ; b ) From payer 's perspective , intervention cost save compare usual care , standard telephone intervention cost saving ; c ) Self-efficacy improve temporally adherence care HRQoL . The research proven framework improve patient self-efficacy employ intervention , Chronic Disease Self-Management Program ( CDSMP ) , develop Stanford University . It design deliver trained layperson group patient community setting . The CDSMP developer serve consultant study , assist u modify program delivery train lay visitor individual patient home .</detailed_description>
