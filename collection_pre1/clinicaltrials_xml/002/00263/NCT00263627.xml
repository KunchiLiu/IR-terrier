	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Specific Immunotherapy With Aluminium Hydroxide-adsorbed Allergoid Preparation Birch Pollen Allergens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type I allergy immune-disorder stem formation IgE antibodies proteins glycoprotein plant , insect , animal fungi , healthy subject consider harmless . However , allergic patient cross-linking specific IgE-antibodies effector cell allergens activates immunological cascade lead symptom Type I allergy include rhinitis , conjunctivitis , asthma , anaphylactic shock . Pollens wind-pollinated plant include tree , grass weed , amongst frequent potent elicitors Type I allergy . It possible avoid exposure pollens therefore symptoms patient inevitably suffer must treat either symptomatic medication allergen specific immunotherapy . The Betulaceae family include genus Alnus ( alder ) , Betula ( birch ) Corylus ( hazel ) . Trees belong genus widespread middle northern Europe , combination fact shed large quantity wind-borne pollen , lead allergenic significance . The prevalence sensitisation birch pollen study , case middle European ( Viennese ) population , example , demonstrate approximately 40 % patient allergic rhinitis sensitise . Although pollen season one genus seldom last week , well-documented cross-reactivity different Betulaceae tree pollen Fagales order contributes protract season symptom many allergic patient . Allergoids prepare chemical modification partially purify native aqueous aller-gen extract . Native allergen extract deplete component molecular mass less 5000 Dalton diafiltration prior chemical modification aldehyde . The modification cause substantial reduction allergenicity extract judge skin prick testing , provocation testing , histamine release sensitise leukocyte measurement IgE-binding activity RAST-inhibition . However , immunogenic activity T-cell reactivity retain . These property enable allergoids use basis allergen specific immunotherapy reduce risk induce IgE-mediated side-reactions possibility administer large dos immunogen short time course native allergen .</detailed_description>
