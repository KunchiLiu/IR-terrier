	<brief_summary>This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure serotonin receptor subtype brain call 5-HT ( 1A ) . This receptor target drug therapy treat anxiety depression . The study see newly develop radioligand ( radioactive substance use PET scan study receptor system brain ) call [ ( 11 ) C ] ( - ) -RWAY effective radioligands currently use brain receptor research . Healthy subject 18-40 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood urine test . Participants undergo PET MRI scan follow : PET scan PET use small amount radioactive chemical call tracer ( case , [ ( 11 ) C ] ( - ) -RWAY ) `` label '' active area brain . For procedure , subject lie scanner bed . A special mask fit subject 's head attach bed help keep head still scan image clear . A brief scan do tracer inject provide measure brain help precise calculation information subsequent scan . Then , tracer inject catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm picture take 2 hour , subject lie still scanner bed . Subjects return clinic blood urine test 24 hour scan . MRI The MRI scan do within 1 year PET scan . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organs-in case , brain . The subject lie table move scanner ( tube-like device ) , wear earplug muffle noise machine scan process . The space scanner confine may cause people somewhat anxious . An intercom system allow subject speak staff member performing study time procedure , procedure stop time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The 5-hydroxytryptamine ( serotonin , 5-HT ) 5-HT ( 1A ) receptor subtype target drug therapy treatment anxiety depression . Radioligands currently use PET study human brain 5-HT ( 1A ) receptor clinical research drug development base WAY-100635 . Though variously effective , suffer one drawback respect measure relative regional receptor density . These drawback include : rapid metabolism low non-specific binding [ carbonyl- ( 11 ) C ] WAY-100635 ; defluoridation [ 18F ] trans-FCWAY . Therefore , recently develop [ ( 11 ) C ] ( - ) -RWAY alternative radioligand brain 5 HT ( 1A ) receptor . Even though similar WAY-100635 , [ ( 11 ) C ] ( - ) -RWAY reverse amide linkage . Reversal direction amide bond may confer resistance amide hydrolysis make acceptable easy label O-methoxy group . In present protocol , plan perform kinetic brain imaging study healthy human subject measure 5 HT ( 1A ) receptor brain region [ ( 11 ) C ] ( - ) -RWAY .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All subject must healthy age 1865 year . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Current psychiatric illness , substance abuse severe systemic disease base history physical exam . Any exist physical exam ECG within one year review none already exist chart , obtain review . Laboratory test clinically significant abnormality . Prior participation research protocols clinical care last year radiation exposure would exceed annual limit . Pregnancy breast feed . Claustrophobia . Presence ferromagnetic metal body heart pacemaker . Positive HIV test . A history brain disease .</criteria>
