	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Contraceptive Vaginal Ring Delivering Nestorone® Ethinyl Estradiol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study evaluate contraceptive efficacy , cycle control , safety reusable CVR deliver low daily dos NES EE 1-year ( 13-cycle ) period . Nestorone potent , nonandrogenic , 19-norprogesterone derivative , active give orally , highly active deliver via non-oral delivery system , CVRs , implant , transdermal preparation . The high potency NES make excellent candidate use contraceptive delivery system design effective prolong period . This characteristic Nestorone utilized design contraceptive vaginal ring release low daily dos NES EE effective 1-year ( 13-cycle ) period . The NES/EE vaginal ring long-acting contraceptive device , , unlike long-term method , use control woman without need medical intervention . The efficacy NES/EE vaginal ring prevent pregnancy 1-year ( 13-cycle ) period study woman regular sexual activity use form contraception . The Pearl index woman ( 18- &lt; 40 ) Kaplan-Meier life table analysis assess subject subject £ 35 year provide supportive analysis demonstrate efficacy . Pearl index base cycle cycle back-up contraception use . The number bleeding/spotting day per cycle reference period use evaluate cycle control . Safety evaluate regular assessment blood pressure , pulse , body weight laboratory test Pap smear screen termination , frequency adverse event serious adverse event . Additional safety evaluation obtain companion Phase 3 study conduct NIH ( Protocol CCN006 ) three substudies evaluate 1 ) effect treatment 4 hepatic protein may associate risk thromboembolism ; 2 ) effect reuse CVR 13 consecutive cycle vaginal flora risk infection ; 3 ) effect vaginal delivery NES EE endometrium . A nested pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics/safety study also conduct subset 39 patient . Blood sample draw study cycle 1 , 3 , 13 order ass ovulation suppression , measure serum progesterone concentration , pharmacokinetics NES EE .</detailed_description>
