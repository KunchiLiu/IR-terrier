	<brief_title>An fMRI Study Effect Intravenous Oxytocin v . Placebo Response Inhibition Face Processing Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism developmental disorder affect approximately 60/10,000 individual . It characterize social language deficit repetitive behaviors/restricted interest . Functional image become useful tool try understand neurobiology autism . Oxytocin hormone produce brain assist labor lactation . Recent evidence suggest may involve social attachment repetitive behavior . In project , study oxytocin change way brain autistic adult process face , deal response inhibition ( ability interrupt ongoing response prove ineffective interfering attain goal ) . There currently functional image data assess effect oxytocin brain . We explore activation pattern response oxytocin across circuit involve social cognition ( face fusiform area ) response inhibition ( caudate , orbitofrontal dorsolateral cortex ) administer specific fMRI task activate circuit oxytocin infusion . We also explore effect oxytocin area administer specific cognitive testing associate fMRI oxytocin infusion .</detailed_description>
