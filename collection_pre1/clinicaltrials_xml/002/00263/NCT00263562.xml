	<brief_summary>The painful episode common problem experience child sickle cell disease . Although various treatment available painful episode , medication commonly give pain pain medication morphine . Fluids also use . Even treatment , many child still severe pain difficult control . In addition pain medication , medication may useful . Methylprednisolone ( solumedrol ) prednisone group medication call steroid may helpful painful episode . These medication know low amount inflammation ( mean swell , tenderness , soreness ) body . Because medication may help pain , ask part study . These type medication use illness asthma , especially time illness gotten bad . The main purpose study see methylprednisolone prednisone low amount pain length hospital stay . In addition pain medication normally receive , assign one 2 group : 1 ) experimental group active form medicine , 2 ) comparison group without active form medicine . In either group , still receive treatment would normally receive painful episode , include pain medicine fluid . You doctor know group assign . If decide part study follow happen : For first 5 day , ask : 1 ) describe current pain ( 0=no pain 10=a lot pain ) , bad pain ( 0=no pain 10=a lot pain ) , least pain ( 0=no pain 10=a lot pain ) , amount pain relief ( 0=no relief 10=complete relief ) ; 2 ) describe sign symptom feel , include fill pain scale form day ; 3 ) take medicine 5 day , either home hospital . Thirty day study , study researcher call ask question pain , painful episode , medication . If discharge home sooner 5 day start study , research staff call ask question , remind fill pain form , remind take medicine . If discharge home , give pain scale fill day home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In United States , 9 % African Americans sickle cell trait 1 600 sickle cell disease . Vaso- occlusive crisis sickle cell disease remain frequent cause severe pain , lead emergency room visit , hospitalization , dependence upon narcotic analgesia . Current treatment vaso-occlusive crisis include IV analgesia narcotic , NSAIDS , hydration . Admissions frequent , prolong , significantly diminish quality life . Understanding pathophysiology vaso-occlusive crisis help find possible treatment . The etiology vaso- occlusive crisis include HbS polymerization ; sickle erythrocyte polymerization ; endothelial damage ; inflammation , reperfusion injury , oxidant radical production ( Steinberg et al , Hematology , 2004 ) . For example , hydroxyurea work increase amount fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) thus inhibit polymerization , reduce incidence pain nearly 50 % . Glucocorticoids would expect exert effect endothelium inflammation . Vaso-occlusive crisis share similar feature inflammatory process , include clinical symptom swell , erythema , warmth ; laboratory finding leukocytosis elevate ESR . It previously theorize glucocorticoid , use many inflammatory disorder , could decrease duration severity vaso-occlusive crisis . Methylprednisolone corticosteroid decrease inflammation suppression migration polymorphonuclear leukocytes reversal increase capillary permeability ( Takemoto , et al 2004 ) . A randomized , placebo-controlled study 2 dos intravenous methylprednisolone vaso-occlusive crisis show duration severe pain need inpatient analgesia decrease patient receive methylprednisolone ; however intervention patient rebound attack receive placebo . ( Griffin et al , NEJM , 1994 ) Previous study examine long-term administration steroid hormone include testosterone , progesterone , medroxyprogesterone patient sickle cell disease . In placebo-controlled crossover trial , patient receive steroid few vaso-occlusive episode placebo-treated patient ( Isaacs et al , Lancet,1972 ; DeCeulaer et al , Lancet , 1982 ) . Initial report glucocorticoids vaso-occlusive crisis include uncontrolled report hydrocortisone adjunctive therapy VOC ( Araujo et al , Blood , 1990 ) . A case report show efficacy dexamethasone vaso-occlusive crisis child ( Robinson et al , Lancet , 1979 ) . The mechanism steroid effect uncertain . In acute chest syndrome , share many clinical feature vaso-occlusive crisis , intravenous therapy dexamethasone show reduce length hospital stay , prevent clinical deterioration , reduce need blood transfusion ( Bernini et al , Blood , 1998 ) . In placebo-controlled trial high-does methylprednisolone VOC , patient severe pain require hospital admission randomize receive methylprednisolone placebo ( 15 mg/kg maximum 1 gram ) admission 24 hour later . The duration inpatient analgesia significantly short patient receive methylprednisolone . However , patient receive methylprednisolone much likely readmitted shortly finish therapy . In addition , study criticize patient rate pain , patient receive patient-controlled analgesia hospitalize . Since trial publish , advance standard management VOC . Ketorolac , non-steroidal analgesic , standard adjunctive therapy , patient quickly place patient-controlled analgesia . In addition , patient receive chronic , preventative therapy hydroxyurea chronic transfusion . We therefore interest repeat expand upon result obtain several year ago evaluate role steroid give slightly longer period time . The primary objective study determine whether use high-dose methylprednisolone follow steroid taper decrease duration hospitalization severity pain VOC sickle cell disease . Primary Hypothesis : The experimental group treat high-dose methylprednisolone steroid taper plus conventional therapy lesser duration low severity pain VOC control group . In addition , secondary objective : 1. determine whether methylprednisolone regimen decrease number inpatient admission . 2. examine number type complication side effect ( include infection , hypertension , GI bleed ) 3. determine rate recurrent episodes pain within one month treatment . 4. determine whether amount analgesic use decrease hospitalization .</detailed_description>
