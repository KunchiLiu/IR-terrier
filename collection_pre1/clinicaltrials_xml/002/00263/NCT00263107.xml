	<brief_title>Postoperative Telerounding : A Multi-Center Prospective Randomized Assessment Patient Outcomes Satisfaction .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Two hundred seventy patient recruit three site prospective multi-center randomize trial . Participating institution University California , Davis Medical Center ( Sacramento CA ) , Johns Hopkins Hospital ( Baltimore MD ) Sentara Health ( Norfolk VA ) . Internal Review Board approval grant institution independently . The study population consist patient schedule urologic surgery , age 18 , able read understand English . Patients undergo follow laparoscopic procedure offer participation : nephrectomy , partial nephrectomy , nephroureterectomy , retroperitoneal lymph node dissection , partial ureterectomy , radical prostatectomy . Patients expect hospital stay 24 72 hour . Eligible patient unable provide consent wish participate study receive standard care provide institution . A total two hundred seventy patient consented participation . Randomization : A stratified block scheme use randomization . Participating patient randomize either : standard daily bedside round attend surgeon ( control arm ) , daily telerounding attend surgeon ( intervention arm ) . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure difference rate attend surgeon-identified complication standard round telerounds . The secondary outcome measure include difference length stay patient report satisfaction hospitalization . Protocol : Consenting patient schedule surgery received standard peri-operative immediate post-operative care . All patient manage rapid recovery protocol . This include : liquid diet begin twelve hour surgery immediate advancement tolerate ; complete blood count , serum electrolyte , BUN creatnine recovery room morning discharge ; usual nursing data record shift . These data point include oral temperature , blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate , fluid intake , fluid output , pain scale Once transfer patient floor , patient communicate attend physician daily basis . The visit , either bedside via telerounds follow set scripting . The visit conduct patient attend without staff present . The focus visit review objective data ( vital sign , fluid balance laboratory value ) , subjective data ( cursory abdominal exam bedside evaluation drain effluent ) discussion anticipated goal day . Visit duration time . Intervention patient could remove study time request bedside visit attend physician . Telerounding conclude either hospital discharge identification major post-operative complication . Definitions : A major complication define event require transfer monitor set . Minor complication include event delay discharge great 24 hour beyond expect length stay . For example ( limit ) : post-operative ileus , drop hematocrit , prolong drain output fever Event monitoring : Identification complication record prospectively . Usual resident-level bedside round maintain throughout study . The resident team attend surgeon record identified event independently , thus allow evaluation concordance . This dual rounding design serve minimally acceptable standard stipulate various internal review board . As precondition IRB approval , identification event require notification attend surgeon timely fashion . Instrument : We utilize validate 21-item questionnaire evaluate patient rating hospital care . Items regard postoperative care design use extensively test validated response scale ( 1 , poor 5 , excellent ) . Item stem modify Patient Judgments Hospital Quality make salient postoperative experience . Five item ask patient rate baseline health status well health status hospitalization . Seven item ask patient evaluate aspect care receive in-patient . Nine item ask randomized telerounding arm evaluate telecommunication system indicate level interest system incorporate usual post-operative care . Device : The telerounding robot 60-inch tall wheel driven device . The robot consist motor base unit , Pentium III CPU , high definition digital camera , flat screen monitor microphone . Data robot transfer high-speed wireless network integrate proprietary software . The physician connects remotely robot via base station . The base station consist Pentium III desktop computer , high definition digital camera , flat screen monitor , microphone joystick controller . Each institution use identical technology . Prior test system demonstrate imperceptible video audio delay . Analytic Plan : The primary endpoint study patient morbidity . The expected rate complication ( major minor ) laparoscopic urologic procedure 16 % . Based power calculation , total 270 patient ( 135 arm ) require detect 1 % difference complication 0.05 alpha level 0.8 beta level . Continuous variable compare use student T-test . Proportions compare use chi-square analysis . Logistic regression reserve adjustment base observed statistical difference baseline demographic data .</detailed_description>
