	<brief_summary>This study look change take place blood level key marker oxidative stress . Oxidative stress biological equivalent rust car . It change vital cell chemistry . It known occur high pressure oxygen , little know change pressure slightly great normal atmospheric pressure . Hyperbaric therapy use variety medical condition . It test study safety . It assess ability hyperbaric oxygen improve clinical condition child autism . This study felt important since autism appear associate oxidative stress hyperbarics use `` off-label '' condition without safety study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood drawn immediately prior one hour session hyperbarics ( HBT . A catheter insert vein convert heparin lock indwell port next blood draw . The child ( ages 5-12 year ) undergo 1 hour compression 1.3 atmospheric pressure ( 4 psi room air pressure ) . Supplemental oxygen provide child . A second blood draw catheter site accomplish immediately child come HBT chamber . These sent laboratory evaluation change reduce glutathione lipid peroxide .</detailed_description>
