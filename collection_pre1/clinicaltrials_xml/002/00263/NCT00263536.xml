	<detailed_description>The prevalent disorder eating pattern describe overweight youth loss control ( LOC ) eating , individual experience inability control amount food consuming . LOC eat associate cross-sectionally great adiposity child adolescent , appear predispose youth gain weight body fat expect due normal growth , thus likely contribute obesity susceptible individual . No prior study examine whether LOC eat decreased intervention child adolescent , whether program reduce LOC eat affect weight gain . Interpersonal Psychotherapy ( IPT ) , form psychotherapy adapt treatment eat disorder , demonstrate efficacy reduce binge eat episode induce modest weight loss ( least weight stabilization ) among adult diagnose binge eat disorder . In Study 1 , propose pilot study efficacy group IPT intervention slow trajectory weight gain 36 overweight at-risk overweight youth report symptom LOC eat . We hypothesize reduction LOC eat among adolescent engage episode risk obesity decrease likelihood inappropriate weight gain . In pilot study , change body composition adolescent girl participate 12-week IPT group intervention compare girl participate health education program 6 month 1 year follow-up visit . Significantly girl participate IPT stabilize weight compare girl participate health education .
