	<brief_summary>Serum insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) measurement show correlate well growth hormone action effect , recent data show serum IGF-I may relate safety efficacy growth hormone ( GH ) treatment patient . Some study indicate high IGF-I level associate increase cancer risk , low IGF-I level associate increase risk cardiovascular disease . Studies child also show serum IGF-I level correlate change height score achieve ( , high IGF-I level , great gain height ) . Pediatric endocrinologist therefore begin use serum IGF-I level , addition growth rate weight gain , adjust GH dose treat child . Although monitor serum IGF-I level become standard care patient begin treat GH , guideline regard actual logistics adjust GH dose . As serum IGF-I level link safety efficacy GH treatment , ideal practice would maintain serum IGF-I level within certain target range . The overall goal study construct mathematical model predicts change GH dose necessary achieve desire change IGF-I level . Hypotheses tested study include follow : IGF-I measurement role optimization GH therapy ; GH dose change achieve IGF-I change predictable ; gender puberty affect relationship dose change target IGF-I change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Constructing Insulin-Like Growth Factor-based Prediction Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first phase study , previously approve UCLA IRB August 2004 , involve retrospective chart review collection preexist data . We analyze chart patient underwent non-weight-based GH dose adjustment precede followed serum IGF-I level . Data collect include patient 's age , gender , height , weight , linear height velocity , pubertal status , GH dose , IGF-I level , disease condition ( i.e. , growth hormone deficiency , idiopathic short stature , small-for-gestational age ) record adverse effect . Based data collect , perform statistical analysis relationship GH dose change change IGF-I level achieve , find prepubertal child , significant relationship GH dose change change correspond IGF-I level . We subsequently construct mathematical prediction model allow u determine GH dose change necessary achieve desire IGF-I level , second phase study , plan apply mathematical prediction model prospectively guide GH dose adjustment prepubertal child treat GH therapy . Children treat GH typically follow outpatient Endocrinology clinic every 3-4 month , practitioner routinely obtain serum IGF-I level ( via venipuncture outpatient laboratory ) monitoring purpose . Validation GH dose change/IGF-I change prediction model require assessment sequential serum IGF-I level measurement immediately precede GH dose change , within 1-4 month follow GH dose change . We plan continue retrospective ongoing analysis patient pair value GH dose adjustment precede followed serum IGF-I level , order may continue fine-tune prediction model optimize GH dose adjustment .</detailed_description>
