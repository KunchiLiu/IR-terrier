	<brief_title>Treatment Study Soft Palatal Implants Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , frequently associate disruptive snoring , prevalent disorder increasingly recognize health care provider lay people alike important factor impair daytime executive function well cardiovascular disease risk . Along increase recognition diagnosis come grow pool patient milder disease associate challenge ideal management . Positive airway pressure ( PAP ) well establish mainstay treatment OSA since effective reversing daytime neurocognitive sequela may useful adjunct therapy cardiovascular disease coexist OSA . In patient mild OSA , however , response PAP therapy appear mute , related part poor adherence treatment . In response , number alternative treatment evolve . The recent innovation soft palatal implant , , non-randomized , uncontrolled study demonstrate reasonable efficacy treatment snore mild moderate OSA . How implant compare standard therapy effect cardiovascular variable unknown . Because ease rapidity system implant , treatment effect independent patient compliance , high potential widespread use patient milder OSA . We therefore conduct randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial compare impact palatal implant PAP sleep disorder breathing , daytime symptom blood pressure , well patient / bed partner acceptance .</detailed_description>
