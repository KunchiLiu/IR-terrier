	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Sometimes treatment , tumor may need additional treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . It yet know whether erlotinib effective observation first-line chemotherapy treat patient ovarian cancer , peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study erlotinib see well work compare observation treat patient undergone first-line chemotherapy ovarian cancer , peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Observation Treating Patients Who Have Undergone First-Line Chemotherapy Ovarian Cancer , Peritoneal Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare benefit , term progression-free survival , maintenance therapy comprise erlotinib vs observation patient respond stable disease first-line , platinum-based chemotherapy high-risk stage I stage II-IV ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine safety erlotinib patient . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease stage ( I-II v III-IV ) , participate center , age ( ≤ 65 v &gt; 65 ) , response first-line therapy ( evidence disease/complete response vs partial response v stable disease ) , first-line therapy ( platinum-based v platinum/taxane combination v platinum-based triplet ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral erlotinib daily 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients undergo observation per standard care . Quality life assess baseline every 3 month 2 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 830 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
