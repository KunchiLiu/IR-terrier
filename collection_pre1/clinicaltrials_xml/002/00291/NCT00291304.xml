	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) well know image tool investigation diagnosis breast cancer , use addition breast mammogram ultrasound . Recent publication suggest MRI may best test use woman dense breast , family history breast cancer breast cancer treat breast save measure . MRI show well tool show multiple breast cancer spot mammography ultrasound . The radiologist radiology student opportunity review MRI scan along breast ultrasound mammography film pathology report breast cancer surgery complete CCI . This may enable learn various subtypes breast cancer look MRI . The goal : 1 ) gain good breast MRI expertise , give Radiology resident complete diagnostic program . 2 ) develop good MRI breast experience , enable Cross Cancer Institute centre excellence Breast MRI northern Alberta .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Information In addition gold standard image mammography breast ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) become well establish investigational modality diagnosis stag breast cancer . MRI demonstrate increased sensitivity specificity relative mammography breast ultrasound screen woman increase risk breast cancer development ( i.e . familial history disease / genetic predisposition ) dense breast tissue . MRI also prove sensitive detection multi-focal , multi-centric breast lesion , permit accurate staging disease . However , despite demonstrate efficacy , standardization MRI study one Institution another often difficult Institution standard breast protocol sequence set accordance manufacturer machine manner breast examination design . At Cross Cancer Institute ( CCI ) breast MRI protocol base technical procedure recommend literature personal scanning experience develop . However , due limit number patient undergoing breast MRI examination , current experience limit relative level expertise demonstrate interpretation breast ultrasound mammographic scan . Fortunately , opportunity obtain MRI - pathology correlation Dr. Kelly Dabbs perform site breast cancer surgery CCI . We propose obtain MRI examination consent patient prior surgical procedure . The MRI result patient compare previous breast imaging ( mammography breast ultrasound ) histopathological specimen determine correlative accuracy MRI technique . To assess whether size , grade , presence lymphovascular invasion associate ductal carcinoma situ influence accuracy MR imaging , breast carcinoma subtypes include study . As teach hospital , CCI provide mammographic breast ultrasound train Residents Diagnostic Radiology Program University Alberta . Although breast MRI part train program , currently necessary volume breast MRI scan provide Residents adequate experience modality . The establishment breast MRI protocol , one refers eligible CCI breast cancer patient pre-surgery MRI examination , promote development expertise area , provide Residents comprehensive Breast program keep CCI lead edge breast cancer care . Objectives Primary Objective : ass MRI breast correlate standard care include biopsy , surgery , breast ultrasound mammography . Secondary Objective : ass MRI correlate breast cancer pathology collect CCI . Study Design A research study propose information mind , whereby Dr. Kelly Dabbs refers consent surgical patient know breast carcinoma pre-surgical breast MRI . The MRI result review along mammogram breast ultrasound correlate pathology finding . The intent correlate various sub-types breast carcinoma MRI , well ass whether MRI demonstrate change dependent upon extent lymphovascular invasion , presence associate ductal carcinoma situ size , cellular composition grade cancer . Dr. Dabbs explain study rational give patient copy Informed Consent , patient willing undergo procedure , schedule MRI CCI . It aim accrue 50 patient per year two year , total 100 patient . Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criterion : - Females ? 18 year age - Females refer Dr. Kelly Dabbs breast cancer surgery pathology positive breast carcinoma , sub-type . Exclusion criterion : - Pacemakers - Aneurysm clip - Cochlear implant - Epicardial pacemaker wire - Neural stimulators - Significant claustrophobia - Significant obesity would enable patient fit scanner - Pregnancy breastfeed Recruitment Surgical patient refer Dr. Kelly Dabbs undergo pre-surgical MRI examination provide meet study eligibility criterion . Statistical analysis N/AP Stopping Rules The study end first 100 subject enrol undergone MRI breast scan . Data Safety Monitoring Committee N/AP</detailed_description>
