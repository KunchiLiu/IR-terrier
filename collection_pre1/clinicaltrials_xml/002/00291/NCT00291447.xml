	<brief_title>111-In-ch806 Patients With Advanced Tumours Expressing 806 Antigen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical research study explore activity new experimental antibody ch806 human first time . Cancers arise organ cure case various combination surgery , chemotherapy radiotherapy . However , cancer spread organ , treatment commonly use method unlikely cure cancer treatment design control growth cancer problem cause . One newer treatment approach involve target marker ( antigen ) call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , find tumour cell ’ surface , specially construct monoclonal antibody call “ ch806 ” . Antibodies proteins find blood . Antibodies normally protect u foreign invader , bacteria virus . They help destroy foreign substance bind activate white blood cell blood protein , result destruction . Tumour cell also antigens targeted antibody . A receptor express high amount ( over-expressed ) various cancer cell , call epidermal growth factor ( EGFR ) identify , study target variety antibody . One antibody , mAb806 , originally make mouse protein . Because mAb806 mouse antibody , give human body would see foreign protein would likely react unwanted immune response . To overcome , structure original mouse antibody call mAb 806 change appear “ human-like ” . And chimeric antibody ( part mouse part human ) call ch806 produce . The study open patient whose tumour show express 806 antigen special test . Further test require determine eligibility study . These test determine general health include : physical examination ; blood sample routine test ; routine test determine extent tumour prior start treatment 111 In-ch806 ( eg . X-ray , CT scan , etc . ) On study , 111In-ch806 give infusion vein one hour . Blood sample determine amount drug blood ( pharmacokinetics ) , take number time day 111 In-ch806 infusion ; every 2nd day first week ; 1 week , 2 week 3 week infusion . Blood test also use monitor general health see immune system recognises infuse antibody make another antibody . Such response call “ anti-ch806 antibody ” “ HACA ” . Gamma camera scan see 111 In-ch806 go body do right first infusion , 3 time next seven day . The scan take one hour time . Visits weekly follow examination blood test 30 day infusion combine gamma camera scan . Tumour reassess 30 day infusion use type scan study entry . Further treatment course 111In-ch806 available time , study test safety single infusion .</detailed_description>

Primary central nervous system tumour ( e.g . Glioblastoma Multiforme ) exclusion criterion . Other serious illness , eg , serious infection require antibiotic , bleed disorder . Chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy within 4 week study entry ( 6 week nitrosoureas ) . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association Class III/IV ) Other malignancy within 3 year prior entry study , except treat nonmelanoma skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ . Mental impairment may compromise ability give informed consent comply requirement study . Lack availability immunological clinical followup assessment . Participation clinical trial involve another investigational agent within 4 week prior enrollment . Pregnancy breastfeed . Women childbearing potential : Refusal inability use effective mean contraception . Concomitant treatment systemic corticosteroid except patient Glioblastoma . ( Topical inhalational corticosteroid permit ) Prior administration monoclonal antibody antibody fragment , positive human antichimeric antibody ( HACA ) titre .</criteria>
