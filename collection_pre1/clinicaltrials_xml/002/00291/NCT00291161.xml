	<brief_summary>Background : Partners Dementia Care ( PDC ) care coordination support service intervention veteran dementia family caregiver , deliver partnership VA medical center local Alzheimer 's Association Chapters . PDC design feasible practical intervention integrate health , community , support service . PDC standardize protocol care coordination support service , include guideline care plan assessment , care plan development implementation , ongoing monitoring , reassessment . It also offer structured training curriculum provider operation manual uniform implementation . Objectives : The primary objective test impact PDC outcomes veteran dementia family caregiver . Two specific research objective correspond hypothesis address : 1 . To test impact PDC three category outcomes : psychosocial well-being outcome ( patient caregiver effect ) ; health care service use ( patient effect ) ; health care cost ( patient effect ) . HI : PDC , compare usual care , improve psychosocial well-being patient dementia caregiver . H2 : PDC , compare usual care , reduce health care service use patient dementia . H3 : PDC prefer usual care base cost-benefit analysis . H4 : The PDC intervention effective improve psychosocial well-being reduce health care service use patient caregiver deal severe patient impairment ( e.g. , cognitive status , functional status , level problem behavior ) . 2 . To evaluate impact PDC role intra-psychic strain cause dementia care ( patient caregiver effect ) . H5a : PDC , compare usual care , decrease patient role intra-psychic strain . H5b : PDC , compare usual care , decrease caregiver role intra-psychic strain .

	<detailed_description>Background : Dementia affect entire family negatively impact multiple domain include physical health , emotional health , social relationship , legal financial issue ( Gurland , 1980 ; Kunik , Snow , Molinari , Menke , Souchek , Sullivan et al , 2003 ; Schulz , Visintainer , &amp; Williamson , 1990 ; Wright , Clipp , &amp; George , 1993 ) . Particularly challenge access range service need address care need individual dementia primary family caregiver . Common issue include : obtain adequate diagnostic testing ; understanding treatment option medication ; difficulty memory behavioral symptom ; care- illness-related strain ( Mitnick , Leffler , &amp; Hood , 2010 ) . Additionally , many unmet care need result service fragmentation inadequate communication among different medical provider , medical provider consumer , medical provider community service ( Reuben , Levin , Frank , 2009 ) . Built upon two prior study : Cleveland Alzheimer 's Managed Care Demonstration ( Bass , Clark , Looman , McCarthy , &amp; Eckert , 2003 ) Chronic Care Networks Alzheimer 's Disease ( CCN/AD ) ( Maslow &amp; Bass , 2003 ; Maslow &amp; Selstad , 2001 ) , PDC 5-year research investigation test effectiveness telephone-based , innovative care-coordination intervention design address unmet care need Veterans dementia family caregiver across dementia stage . PDC implement formal partnership VA medical center local Alzheimer 's Association ( AA ) chapter . Essential feature PDC include : 1 ) formal partnership VA medical center Alzheimer 's Association Chapters ; 2 ) multidimensional assessment treatment approach , 3 ) ongoing monitor long-term relationship family ; 4 ) computerize information system guide service delivery fidelity monitoring . For complete description PDC intervention protocol please see Judge , Bass , Snow , Wilson , Morgan , Looman , McCarthy , Kunik ( 2010 ) . Objectives : The primary objective investigation rigorously test impact PDC number outcome Veterans dementia , family caregiver , healthcare provider . Within VA Medical Centers , focus improve dementia care primary care clinic , include geriatrics . Two specific research objective correspond hypothesis address : 1 . To test impact PDC three category outcomes : psychosocial well-being outcome ( patient caregiver effect ) ; healthcare service use ( patient effect ) ; health care cost ( patient effect ) . Hypothesis 1 : PDC , compare usual care , improve psychosocial well-being , include depression , health status , adequacy care , quality care patient dementia caregiver . Hypothesis 2 : PDC , compare usual care , reduce healthcare service use patient dementia , include hospital admission , emergency department visit , nurse home admission , physician visit . Hypothesis 3 : PDC prefer usual care , base cost-effectiveness cost-benefit analysis . Hypothesis 4 : The PDC intervention effective usual care improve psychosocial well-being reduce health care service use patient caregiver deal severe patient impairment ( e.g. , cognitive status , functional status , level problem behavior ) . 2 . To evaluate impact PDC role intra-psychic strain cause dementia care ( patient caregiver effect ) . Hypothesis 5a : PDC , compare usual care , decrease patient role intra-psychic strain , include embarrassment illness , emotional strain , relationship strain , social isolation . Hypothesis 5b : PDC , compare usual care , decrease caregiver role intra-psychic strain , include role captivity , work care-related strain , relationship strain , emotional physical health deterioration , caregiving efficacy . Hypothesis 6 : The PDC intervention effective usual care decrease role intra-psychic strain patient caregiver deal severe patient impairment ( e.g. , cognitive status , functional status , level problem behavior ) . Methods : The propose study 55-month , controlled trial PDC . The project conduct two intervention site three comparison site match organizational , provider , patient characteristic . Partners Dementia Care compare usual care . Both group receive educational material dementia start . PDC Intervention The Chronic Care Model ( Bodenheimer , Wagner , &amp; Grumbach , 2002 ; Bodenheimer , Wagner , &amp; Grumbach , 2002 ) use overarch framework implement PDC include follow component : 1 ) Formal linkages medical center ( VA ) community agency ( Alzheimer 's Association ) ; 2 ) Organizational support key leader broad-based training PDC ; 3 ) Delivery system redesign decision support system ; 4 ) Self-management dementia outline PDC intervention protocol ; 5 ) The development PDC Care Coordination Information System ( CCIS ) clinical information system . PDC four primary way assist family : 1 ) provide disease-related education information ; 2 ) offer emotional support coaching ; 3 ) link family medical non-medical service resource ; 4 ) mobilize organize informal care network . Two key staff member implement intervention : VA Dementia Care Coordinator ( VA DCC ) VA medical center Alzheimer 's Association Care Consultant ( AA CC ) Alzheimer 's Association Chapters . VA DCCs primarily focus veteran ' medical non-medical need assist family effectively use VA resource ; AA CCs primarily focus need informal caregiver care-related strain access non-VA resource . The intervention protocol consist : 1 ) Assessment Care Needs across medical non-medical care issue address 23 domain Veterans 14 domain caregiver ; 2 ) Development Care Goals match priority Veterans caregiver ; 3 ) Development Action Steps concrete behavioral task intend help family move toward goal achievement ( e.g. , individual responsible complete task , expect completion date ) ; 4 ) On-going Monitoring Action Steps regular basis ensure timely completion task , address potential barrier , modify add action step , identify new goal . Analytic Plan With one exception , measure `` objective '' characteristic , include community support-service use , service knowledge , number informal helper , Veterans ' impairment , base information report caregiver . The one exception measure impairment base score standardize mental status test administer Veterans telephone ( i.e. , Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test ; Katzman et al. , 1983 ) . Additionally , small number Veterans ( approximately 5 % ) mild dementia caregiver ; `` objective '' characteristic individual self-reported Veteran . Information use construct measure `` subjective '' characteristic , feeling perception quality care care-related strain , come directly individual whose feeling perception represent .</detailed_description>
