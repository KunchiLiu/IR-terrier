	<brief_summary>Background : The new hollow fibre FX-class dialysers ( Fresenius Medical Care , Bad Homburg , Germany ) feature number technological improvement may benefit patient . This include use advance high-flux polysulfone membrane , Helixone® , extremely high endotoxin retain capability . Theoretically lead reduce systemic inflammation patient , important factor morbidity mortality dialysis . The dialysis membrane first manufacture use membrane-spinning procedure ( nano-controlled spin technology ) enable membrane modulate nano-scale level . The resultant membrane able extremely efficiently remove middle molecule , along minimal loss albumin . These feature may lead improved patient outcome , include reduce systemic inflammation improve quality life . Aims : 1 . To assess short-term effect FX-class Dialyser quality life stable haemodialysis patient 2 . To assess short-term effect FX-class Dialyser inflammatory marker stable haemodialysis patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods Patient selection All patient Joondalup Health Campus satellite dialysis unit invite participate study . Inclusion criterion – 1 . Age &gt; 18years 2 . Able provide inform consent 3 . On haemodialysis 3 month Exclusion criterion – 1 . Active inflammatory , infective neoplastic process within last 1 month 2 . Active major psychiatric condition 3 . Currently haemodiafiltration haemodialysis modality Design This study involve unblinded , cross-over design , patient randomise upon entry one 2 group . The 2 group - 1 . HF80 dialyser ( best currently use dialysers therefore participant require reduction dialysis trial ) ; 2 . FX dialyser . Patients baseline test perform prior intervention repeat 3 month . At 3 month , patient cross-over group test repeat 6 month . Due nature intervention , blind practical . The cross-over design allow maximum power fix relatively small dialysis population ( ~50 patient ) . Independent variable – 1 . Dialysis prescription enrolment . Including dialyser type ( biocompatibility ) 2 . Adequacy dialysis 1 . Urea reduction ratio 2 . Kt/V 3 . Anaemia 1 . Including iron study 2 . Including erythropoietin usage 4 . Calcium phosphate balance . Including Parathyroid hormone level 5 . Serum albumin Outcome marker – 1 . Quality Life ( ) KD-QOL – standardise quality life questionnaire design validated dialysis patient , readily comparable study . ( ii ) Feeling thermometer 2 . Inflammatory marker ( ) High sensitivity c-reactive protein ( ii ) IL-6 ( iii ) White cell count . Statistical analysis : Quality life measure inflammatory marker analyse use pair t-test normality demonstrate . Simple multiple linear regression analysis perform examine association independent variable change outcome variable . STATA 8.2 use assist analysis</detailed_description>
