	<brief_title>Access Program Use AMD3100 Increase Peripheral Blood Stem Cells Transplantation Patients Who Have Failed Standard Therapy Stem Cell Mobilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose program provide access AMD3100 patient would benefit autologous stem cell transplant either previously fail collect enough cell transplant follow standard therapy consider physician reasonable chance collect enough cell transplant . Compassionate use way provide experimental treatment patient eligible receive therapy clinical trial , serious life-threatening illness treatment available . Peripheral blood stem cell obtain apheresis follow stem cell mobilization regimen . The standard care regimen stem cell mobilization include growth factor , G-CSF . AMD3100 give addition G-CSF prior apheresis session . If enough peripheral blood stem cell transplant collect , patient treat high dose chemotherapy preparation transplant transplant cell obtain AMD3100 G-CSF regimen . Patients follow safety transplant outcomes 12 month transplant .</detailed_description>
