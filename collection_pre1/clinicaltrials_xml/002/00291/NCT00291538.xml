	<brief_summary>In open-label randomised phase I trial , bortezomib administrate 2 group 10 patient MM inclusion criterion use extend 2nd line indication , either intravenously ( group 1 = 10 patient ) subcutaneously ( group 2 = 10 patient ) . The schedule administration bortezomib follow : 1.3 mg per square meter body-surface area twice weekly 2 week , follow 1 week without treatment , eight cycle , either IV ( group 1 ) SC ( group 2 ) . The primary objective characterize pharmacokinetics 2 route administration . The secondary objective characterize pharmacodynamics ( 20S proteasome inhibition whole blood ) , toxicity , include cardiac safety , efficacy 2 route administration .</brief_summary>
