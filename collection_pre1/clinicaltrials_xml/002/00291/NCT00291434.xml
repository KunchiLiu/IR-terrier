	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate value two different alter fractionation schedule – hyperfractionation accelerate fractionation concomitant boost – comparison conventional fractionation primary definitive radiotherapy squamous cell carcinoma larynx , oropharynx hypopharynx . The study begin conduct teletherapy unit department cobalt-60 machine . During period expect installation new sophisticated equipment . We assume result study would also able show whether would rational use altered fractionation regimens new machine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Altered Conventional Fractionated Radiotherapy Patients With Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient admit March 1999 December 2000 treat conventionally fractionate radiotherapy . These patient represent retrospective part study . Patients admit January 2001 June 2004 include prospective part study . Following confirmation eligibility , altered fractionation schedule assignment make stratify site origin ( larynx v oropharynx v hypopharynx ) , Karnofsky performance score ( 60 % -70 % v 80 % -100 % ) , stage disease ( I II v III IV ) . Patients randomize receive radiotherapy deliver use either hyperfractionation accelerate fractionation concomitant boost late accelerating component . Exceptions occur patient either refuse treatment two daily fraction offer twice-a-day irradiation lack machine time . Radiotherapy Scheduling Technique The conventionally fractionate radiotherapy schedule 66-70 Gy 6½ -7 week ( one fraction 2 Gy per day , 5 fraction per week ) , whereas hyperfractionation treatment schedule 74.4-79.2 Gy 6.2-7 week ( two fraction 1.2 Gy per day , 10 fraction per week interfraction interval least 6 hour ; Figure 1 ) . The treatment schedule accelerate fractionation use concomitant boost consist daily fraction 1.8 Gy , 5 day week , 32.4 Gy include site disease electively irradiate area neck , follow two daily fraction last 11-12 day . The first daily fraction encompass site disease electively irradiate neck node use dose 1.8 Gy , second daily fraction concomitant boost deliver reduced field encompass gross disease , use fraction 1.5 Gy total dos 68.7-72 Gy 6 week ( Figure 1 ) . The interval two daily fraction least 6 hour .</detailed_description>
