	<brief_title>Capecitabine 131I-huA33 Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial test combination humanise A33 monoclonal antibody tag radioactive iodine 131 ( 131I-huA33 ) together capecitabine chemotherapy patient advance colorectal cancer . When colorectal cancer spread organ , generally consider incurable limited number treatment option . Colorectal cancer cell express protein surface know antigen , one call A33 antigen . An antibody target A33 antigen initially develop mouse find bind human colorectal cancer cell . Because human develop immune reaction give mouse antibody , antibody , like normal human antibody , develop ( humanise A33 antibody ) . In order increase effectiveness , radioactive iodine ( 131I ) attach antibody antibody deliver radiation directly colorectal cancer cell . Previous study show unlabelled humanise A33 antibody well humanise A33 antibody tag radioactive iodine administer safely human major allergic reaction . The addition chemotherapy radiolabelled 131I-huA33 may result treatment effective treatment colorectal cancer either agent alone . The purpose study determine whether safe give humanise A33 antibody tag radioactive iodine together chemotherapy . Different dose level radioactive iodine attach constant dose antibody give together fix total daily capecitabine chemotherapy dose . Providing humanised A33 antibody tag radioactive iodine chemotherapy tolerate well without major side effect , dose capecitabine chemotherapy give 131I-huA33 also increase order determine high dose give safely combination radio-labelled 131I-huA33 . The effectiveness treatment combination advance colorectal cancer also assess . Patients advanced colorectal cancer never previously receive chemotherapy use capecitabine may eligible participate study . A total 15 30 patient expect recruited . Screening blood test perform determine eligibility , well baseline heart lung function test appropriate scan measure tumour size ass radiation within body . Patients give trace label ( small radiation dose ) infusion 131I-hu A33 vein follow week later treatment infusion 131I-hu A33 . The first infusion give outpatient second patient hospitalise confine radiation shield room radiation level fall safe limit . Oral iodine drop also give 28 day order protect thyroid gland effect radioactive iodine . Capecitabine chemotherapy take orally commence time treatment infusion . Each cycle capecitabine chemotherapy involve medication take twice per day total 14 day follow 7 day rest . A total 4 cycle capecitabine give treatment infusion . Blood sample take treatment infusion weekly 9 week 12 week . There weekly physical examination 9 week treatment infusion 12 week . Total study duration 13 week trace label infusion 131I-hu A33 , 12 week treatment infusion 131I-hu A33 . Patients receive one treatment infusion 131I hu-A33 antibody .</detailed_description>
