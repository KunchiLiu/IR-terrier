	<brief_summary>This study test accuracy new home-use electronic device measure record small change Parkinson 's disease symptom , tremor impair movement speech . The test do home result send Internet patient 's doctor . Detecting Parkinson 's disease early stage may permit doctor provide early treatment slow rate disease progression . Patients early Parkinson 's disease ( less 5 year ) rest tremor bradykinesia ( slowness difficulty movement ) take medication disease may eligible study . Candidates screen training practice use home monitoring device 2-3 week . Those demonstrate proficiency device may enrol study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : Baseline Visit Participants ' undergo symptom rating use Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale assessment memory , think depression . At-home test Participants begin at-home test monitoring device baseline visit repeat test weekly 6 month . The test information automatically upload home computer ( provide study ) send investigator via Internet . The test procedure follow : - Introduction questionnaire ( 1 minute ) : Participants question feel test time . - Pegboard test ( 4 minute ) : At sound tone , participant move eight peg right leave use right left hand . - Tapping test ( 3 minute ) : At sound tone , participant alternately press two button right index finger leave index finger . - Reaction time/movement time test ( 3 minute ) : At sound tone , participant move index finger one button , first right hand leave hand . - Digitography testing ( 4 minute ) : At sound tone , participant alternate press two key index middle finger . - Speech + Actiwatch tremor data upload ( 7 minute ) : The participant : 1 ) take deep breath say `` ahhh '' long possible ; 2 ) show picture , sound tone , ask tell story picture ; 3 ) uploads tremor data Actiwatch ( device wear wrist record tremor ) . - At specify time du ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Because neuroprotective strategy Parkinson 's disease primarily aim intervene early phase disease , appropriate measure minor , subtle parkinsonian impairment need define . The gold standard rating scale Parkinson 's disease Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating scale ( UPDRS ) , cover gamut disability level specifically focus early impairment . We develop series motor task perform home-based computer module data collect frequently prospectively without obligate patient come medical center . Study population : The study population consist patient mild early Parkinson disease . Design : This feasibility study longitudinally follow 50 patient mild early Parkinson 's disease receiving symptomatic therapy treatment motor impairment . They train perform task transmit data weekly basis . Outcome measure : We analyze time-related change several domain motor function ( tremor , limb bradykinesia , fine motor bradykinesia , voice , reaction time/movement time ) correlate change UPDRS 3 6 month . We hypothesize patient find assessment technology easy use , positive force life , commit program throughout duration . Further , hypothesize motor change detect technology time UPDRS score show decrement . Over six month , however , decline UPDRS occur correlate decrement computer-based motor task . If , hypothesize , home-based motor test program feasible useful assessment early impairment Parkinson 's disease , particularly applicable neuroprotective trial currently design .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . PD , define least two follow cardinal feature : rest tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity PD diagnosis less equal 5 year . 2 . Hoehn Yahr stage less 3 . 3 . No clinical evidence parkinsonian syndrome ( Progressive supranuclear palsy , Multiple system atrophy , druginduced parkinsonism , lewy body dementia ) . 4 . The patient must drug therapy symptomatic control parkinsonism , specifically levodopa , dopamine agonist , amantadine , anticholinergic drug , COMTinhibitors , selegiline participate initial 6 month study . 5 . Patients must express willingness intent remain medication could affect parkinsonism first 6 month study without first inform site PI . Starting antiParkinson medication necessarily disqualify patient continue study . After initial 6 month participation , patient allow start antiParkinson medication . 6 . Patient must express willingness intent remain medication could affect parkinsonism first 6 month study without first inform site PI . Starting antiParkinson medication necessarily disqualify patient continue study . After initial 6 month participation , patient allow start antiParkinson medication . 7 . Patient must demonstrate proficiency use At Home Testing Program office setting . 8 . Participants must willing technician come home set equipment , check periodically , remove study end . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients comorbid neurological psychiatric disorder ( even n't require medication ) . 2 . Patients Parkinson 's disease 5 year . 3 . Patients another movement disorder ( Progressive supranuclear palsy , Multiple system atrophy , druginduced parkinsonism , Lewy body dementia ) . 4 . Disruptive noncompliance requirement study cause inability collect valid clean data . 5 . Inability accurately perform task require study ( i.e . use equipment properly transfer data use simple USB connection ) . Please note inclusion exclusion criterion base depression dementia . However , problem interfere proficiency data acquisition screen phase , eligible . The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale measure use . Depression scale score use potential covariants compliance exploratory analysis . Furthermore , treatment medical condition allow treatment period . Treatment feature Parkinson 's disease involve exclusionary medication ( see inclusion/exclusion criterion ) allow .</criteria>
