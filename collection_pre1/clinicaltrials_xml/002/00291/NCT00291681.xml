	<brief_summary>Our overall objective study study role B cell inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , use combination high-throughput experimental novel bioinformatical technique . Idiopathic IBD include Crohn 's disease ( CD ) Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) , chronic inflammatory disorder intestine . IBD common develop country , 1 200 individual affected thesis disease . It currently think disease arises owe complex array genetic , environmental immunologic susceptibility factor . T cell think cause lesion , B cell population apparently significant role well , secrete antibody certain self-antigens . We believe major contribution understand pathogenesis IBD , especially immune pathway leading CD , achieve analysis B cell clone participate immune response gut , particular immunoglobulin ( Ig ) variable region gene diversity , never study context IBD . The adaptive immune system one two biological system capable continuously learn memorize experience . This highly complex , distributed system , pathogen recognition , decision-making action perform interacting network diverse lymphocyte . Immune learn memory embed dynamical state complete lymphocyte repertoire , understood study behavior single cell type . This complexity , increase non-linear behavior component , elucidate use theoretical tool complement experimental clinical study . Needless say , many aspect deregulation lymphocyte clone evident phenotype single cell rather population dynamic whole clone ( many clone ) cell , B cell lymphoma . Such aspect best elucidate study population dynamic genetics relevant B cell clone ( ) . In study , propose utilize novel bioinformatical approach â€“ analysis shape Ig gene mutational lineage tree . This main innovative feature proposal , tap parameter never measure analyzed respect B lymphocytes IBD . While method new , already show graphical analysis B cell lineage tree mathematical quantification tree property provide novel insight mechanism normal malignant B cell clonal evolution . A preliminary analysis lineage tree autoimmune disease ( show ) indicate , give sufficient amount data , method could elucidate change Ig gene diversification selection IBD patient . Moreover , aim search correlation parameter characterize Ig gene diversification parameter characterize patient , disease history severity , histological marker , potential yielding novel diagnostic prognostic tool .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Extraction Ig gene sequence IBD patient gut sample . The propose study aim elucidate role B cell IBD via investigate Ig gene diversification . Hence first step extract Ig gene sequence sample ( case resection procedure ) archive pathology laboratory Sheba Medical Center . Samples CD UC case use , DNA extract Ig gene sequence amplify via PCR , order generate sufficient data bioinformatical analysis . Samples inflame gut segment compare sample uninflamed segment ( available ) , order provide internal control comparison IBD-related unrelated B cell clone . 2 . Investigation repertoire degree clonality B cell implicate IBD , base sequence extract aim ( 1 ) . We assume B cell involve chronic disease state undergo Ig gene diversification much longer time B cell normal short-term immune response , hence Ig gene sequence IBD-related B cell exhibit high degree clonality . There may also bias specific Ig variable region ( V ) gene segment usage , observe chronic disease . Hence , sequence obtain aim ( 1 ) align human germline V segment sequence , order identify possible bias V segment usage , identify clonal relationship set sequence patient . Since even gut sample healthy human contain many clonally related Ig gene sequence ( see ) , expect find many clonal sequence sample . 3 . Elucidation dynamic respond B cell clone , use lineage tree analysis clonal Ig gene sequence find aim ( 2 ) . Sets clonally-related Ig gene sequence discover aim ( 3 ) subject lineage tree analysis use method develop Mehr group . The result analysis point difference IBD-related unrelated B cell clone dynamic somatic hypermutation antigen-driven selection . 4 . Search correlation parameter result lineage tree analysis ( aim 3 ) clinical patient parameter . A particularly interesting question whether parameter generate lineage tree analysis Ig gene sequence correlate clinical parameter describe patient ( e.g . age , gender ) , course disease ( e.g . age onset , disease duration , symptom severity ) histological characteristic . We expect analysis two type data ( bioinformatical clinical ) reveal quite correlation , base correlation may able enhance set diagnostic prognostic tool currently available clinician specialize IBD .</detailed_description>
