	<brief_summary>The immune response uraemic patient hepatitis B vaccination impair compare healthy subject . After vaccination , anti-HBs peak antibody concentration reduce . As persistence anti-HBs closely related initial anti-HBs peak , immunogenic vaccine , allow high antibody concentration , would benefit population .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects investigator believe comply requirement protocol ( e.g. , completion diary card , return followup visit ) enrol study . A male female subject 15 year age old time study entry . Written inform consent obtain subject/ subject 's parent guardian . Predialysis patient , peritoneal dialysis patient patient haemodialysis . Predialysis patient define subject documented creatinine clearance les equal 30 ml/min . Seronegative antiHBc antibody HBsAg screening . Documented previous hepatitis B vaccination one full primary course license vaccine ( cumulative dose primary vaccination least 160 mg hepatitis B vaccine ) without subsequent booster . The last dose administer least three month plan dose study vaccine study . Documented response previous hepatitis B vaccination ( i.e . antiHBs antibody concentration ³ 10 mIU/ml primary vaccination booster/s license vaccine ) , loss antiHBs antibody concentration 10 mIU/ml time inclusion study . Patients antibody concentration 50 mIU/ml time inclusion also recruit provide antibody concentration less half high document antibody response achieve primary vaccination booster/s . The interval blood sample correspond document response hepatitis B vaccine dose receive prior blood sample least 25 day If subject female , must nonchildbearing potential , i.e. , either surgically sterilize one year postmenopausal ; , childbearing potential , must abstinent use medicallyapproved contraceptive precaution 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test must agree continue precaution two month completion vaccination series . Subjects participate HN014/HBV001 HN017/HBV003 study Use investigational nonregistered drug vaccine within 30 day precede study vaccine administration , plan use study period . Use registered vaccine within 7 day precede study vaccine administration . History hepatitis B infection . Known exposure hepatitis B virus within six month . Use immunoglobulins within six month precede first study vaccination . Immunosuppression cause administration parenteral steroid chemotherapy ( oral steroid allow ) . Any confirm suspect human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . A family history congenital hereditary immunodeficiency . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine . Acute disease time enrolment . ( Acute disease define presence moderate severe illness without fever . All vaccine administer person minor illness diarrhoea , mild upper respiratory infection without lowgrade febrile illness , i.e. , oral/ axillary temperature &lt; 37.5°C ( 37 °C Czech Republic ) . Oral/axillary temperature equal superior 37.5 °C ( 37 °C Czech Republic ) . Pregnant lactate female</criteria>
