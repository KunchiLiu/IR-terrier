	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : Despite recent advance , pregnant woman newborn continue risk acquire herpes infection . Genital herpes infection epidemic United States . In early 1990 's , 25 % woman US seropositive HSV-2 antibody ( Fleming , 1997 ) . These number likely higher . The incidence neonatal herpes US accurately estimate since reportable disease . However , area US , incidence 1 3,200 live birth would translate incidence approximately three infant day US ( Brown , 2003 ) . In area US , incidence even high , approach 1 1,500 liveborns ( Whitley , personal communication , December 2002 ) . The current management guideline recommend ACOG ( Guidelines Perinatal Care , 2002 ) rely history screen method determine pregnant woman risk transmit herpes newborn . Based data report NHANES III , history unreliable method determine infected genital herpes ( Fleming , 1997 ) . Most importantly , history fails completely identify woman risk transmit herpes newborn - seronegative woman acquire primary infection partner pregnancy . Since at-risk woman accurately identify new accurate type-specific serologic test , effective prevention strategy institute minimize risk transmission neonate . The first obligation diagnose risk . The high risk neonatal transmission mother experience primary genital HSV-1 HSV-2 infection late pregnancy . Studies indicate approximately 1.3 % woman seroconvert pregnancy , among , risk neonatal transmission high 30 - 50 % ( Brown 1991 ) . Conversely , rate neonatal transmission woman recurrent genital herpes infection low ( &lt; 1 % ) ( Brown , 1991 , 1997 ; Smith , 1998 ; Arvin , 1986 ; Fonnest , 1997 ) . However , since genital herpes common , total number case neonatal herpes woman recurrent disease remain high ( Fleming , 1997 ; STD Guidelines , 2002 ) . Once mother identify infect HSV-2 , health care provider - pediatrician obstetrician - alert potential risk neonatal herpes . Management pregnant woman without herpes infection include step design minimize risk herpes transmission neonate . This protocol examine patient acceptance HSV-1 HSV-2 type specific serologic testing ass patient counseling tool . In addition , seroprevalence HSV-2 pregnant patient collect evaluated . STUDY DESIGN This non-treatment study acceptance rate HSV-1 HSV-2 type specific serologic test pregnant woman partner . This study also evaluate Health Care Provider time spent counseling , effectiveness counseling tools/sessions , acceptance antiviral suppression pregnant woman and/or partner . In addition , HSV-2 seroprevalence assess . This study conduct single center ( Obstetrics Gynecology Office ) design yield nationally representative estimate HSV-2 seroprevalence rate . Pregnant woman present first prenatal visit invite enroll . A total 300 patient enrol . The clinician staff describe study patient base provided description . If patient interested participating study , give informed consent sign , tell blood test determine whether seropositive seronegative genital herpes ( HSV-2 ) virus cause cold sore ( HSV-1 ) , give demographic form complete .

For patient unwilling test , counsel questionnaire administer first visit . The investigator office staff monitor time spend counsel session , also provide assessment effectiveness satisfaction counseling tool . STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES Screening Assessments Prior invite patient take part clinical trial , patient 's chart review certain patient know history genital herpes prior knowledge HSV-2 seropositivity . Prior enrollment patient study , investigator appropriate study personnel provide train HSV serologic test provided counseling tool . This ensure patient receive standardize HSV counsel initial visit follow-up visit test result discuss . It important note ideally , person staff administer Counseling Scripts use verbiage consistent provide script This administer care concern private setting .

Patients negative HSV-2 serologic test If woman HSV-1 seronegative , counsel section Script : For patient HSV-1 seronegative - Encourage patient discuss test result mean partner - Ask follow question ( answer document case report form Yes/No response ) : - Do know partner positive HSV-1 HSV-2 . If NO either HSV-1 HSV-2 , follow described . Follow-up visit • During normally schedule pre-natal visit ( week 28 ) , ask patient partner test . Document answer case report form . OR 2 . Patients positive HSV-2 serologic test If woman HSV-1 seronegative , counsel section Script : For patient HSV-1 seronegative - Encourage patient discuss test result mean partner Give patient brochure ( Taking Charge Life instruct patient read entire brochure also focus section related pregnancy - Ask follow question ( answer document case report form Yes/No response ) : - Are willing take medicine treat herpes pregnancy ? - Do know partner positive HSV-1 HSV-2 .
