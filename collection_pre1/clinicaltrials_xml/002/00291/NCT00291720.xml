	<brief_title>Is Spironolactone Safe Effective Treatment Cardiovascular Disease Mild Chronic Renal Failure ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead death half patient chronic renal failure ( CRF ) cause 'vasculopathy ' remain unknown . Aldosterone present circulation renal failure patient high level know exert damaging effect upon myocardium , vasculature autonomic nervous system . Patients randomised determine effect chronic treatment aldosterone receptor inhibitor leave ventricular mass , diastolic function , arterial stiffness autonomic function . All endpoint predictor mortality result study may yield information prognostic value provide basis future mortality study . Premature cardiovascular disease lead cause mortality CRF accounting approximately 60 % death . Across age range , cardiovascular mortality 10 20 time great control young patient relative risk extreme . Dialysis patient age 45 100 time risk cardiovascular death control population . An increase risk also present patient mild renal impairment , estimate occur approximately 8 % population . Thus , renal dysfunction potentially important risk factor coronary artery disease general population . This study build upon previous current BHF fund work Dr Townend colleague Birmingham ( PG97/162 PG02/153 ) result number publication area cardiovascular disease renal failure take new approach examine potential role aldosterone renal 'vasculopathy ' . Pathophysiology myocardial vascular disease chronic renal failure : The main pathological feature cardiovascular system patient renal failure : 1 . LVH often accompany systolic diastolic dysfunction . 2 . Arterial wall thickening , stiffen calcification ( arteriosclerosis ) . 3 . Coronary peripheral artery atherosclerosis . The pathophysiology cardiovascular disease renal failure poorly understood renal function decline , range abnormality occur may exert adverse effect upon cardiovascular system . Hypertension , chronic anaemia activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) sympathetic nervous system contribute development myocardial hypertrophy fibrosis . The abnormality may also lead muscular hypertrophy fibrosis arterial wall include aorta . In combination increase extracellular matrix , loss elastic fibre diffuse medial calcification , arterial wall change lead arterial 'stiffening ' . In addition adverse haemodynamic structural change , endothelial injury , first physiological manifestation atherosclerosis , occur early course renal failure . Hypertension , anaemia , chronic inflammation , atherogenic lipid profile , diabetes less certainly hyperhomocysteinaemia abnormal calcium/phosphate metabolism possible cause endothelial injury recent evidence suggest list add angiotensin II ( ANG II ) aldosterone . Aldosterone cardiovascular disease : The fundamental role RAAS cardiovascular disease apparent result many large ACE inhibitor trial . In patient chronic heart failure high risk coronary artery disease , ACE inhibitor improve survival , functional status hospitalisation . These beneficial effect attribute prevention multiple adverse effect ANG II . More recently , evidence accumulate support important role aldosterone . The persistent elevation ANG II aldosterone concentration ACE inhibitor therapy often term 'escape ' . Aldosterone secretion adrenal cortex persist response ANG II ( produce non ACE enzymatic conversion ANG I ) rise plasma potassium . Comparison effect add ANG II receptor blocker ( ARB ) aldosterone receptor antagonists ACE inhibitor heart failure trial suggest aldosterone escape exert great pathophysiological effect . In ValHeFT addition valsartan ACE inhibitor therapy detectable effect mortality . In RALES EPHESUS trial however , mortality significantly reduce addition spironolactone ( RALES ) eplerenone ( EPHESUS ) standard therapy include ACE inhibitor . Aldosterone synthesise numerous tissue mineralocorticoid receptor present brain , heart blood vessel well kidney . In addition physiological role kidney aldosterone exert several pathological action cardiovascular system : 1 . Endothelial dysfunction : The administration aldosterone sodium rat result transmural coronary arterial inflammation monocyte macrophage infiltration expression inflammatory marker COX-2 , MCP-1 VCAM-1 . The administration aldosterone antagonist markedly reduce inflammatory response . Although similar response occur infusion ANG II , part dependent aldosterone synthesis reduce adrenalectomy restore aldosterone infusion . In vitro , vascular endothelial fibrinolysis inhibit aldosterone result increase plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI-1 ) . In human , primary hyperaldosteronism associate endothelial dysfunction compare normal hypertensive control . In patient chronic heart failure , aldosterone receptor blockade spironolactone result significant improvement endothelial dependent vasodilatation vascular nitric oxide bioactivity . 2 . Myocardial vascular hypertrophy fibrosis : Aldosterone appear cause myocardial vascular injury independently effect blood pressure . Chronic aldosterone infusion sodium loading result myocardial fibrosis ventricular hypertrophy rat . Treatment aldosterone receptor antagonist prevent aortic myocardial fibrosis rat model hypertension even absence blood pressure lower . In addition , aldosterone treat stroke-prone hypertensive rat , spironolactone exert powerful protective effect development nephrosclerotic cerebrovascular lesion . The mechanisms action aldosterone may include upregulation AT1 receptor , direct effect fibroblast collagen synthesis possibly decrease matrix metallo-proteinase secretion . In human , aldosterone concentration correlate mortality chronic heart failure , severity LVH non-diabetic renal failure hypertension negatively carotid artery compliance hypertension . When add ACE inhibitor , treatment aldosterone receptor antagonist reduce LVH hypertension heart failure . Myocardial collagen turnover ( marker fibrosis ) significantly reduce spironolactone RALES study fall marker index related mortality benefit . 3 . Autonomic dysfunction : Like heart failure , renal failure characterise autonomic dysfunction manifest high rest sympathetic tone , impaired vagal control reduce baroreflex sensitivity . The prognostic significance autonomic dysfunction establish renal failure , chronic heart failure , degree dysfunction , measure technique heart rate variability , powerful independent marker prognosis . This evidence , couple efficacy beta-blocker therapy heart failure , suggest autonomic dysfunction actively contribute mortality cardiovascular disease progression . Aldosterone appear increase sympathetic reduce cardiac vagal influence . The action sympathetic nervous system increase result reduce uptake noradrenaline myocardium . A reduction baroreflex sensitivity response aldosterone infusion demonstrate animal man heart failure patient , increase heart rate variability occur response aldosterone inhibition . We recently show acute aldosterone receptor inhibition result improve HRV marker cardiac parasympathetic control healthy subject . 4 . Is effect aldosterone receptor blockade spironolactone mediate lower arterial pressure ? Spironolactone recognise effective anti-hypertensive agent patient hypertension , even resistant drug . It therefore necessary consider whether improvement occur measure arterial stiffness LV mass spironolactone might simply due effect . Several line evidence suggest effect aldosterone inhibition independent blood pressure . The work Rocha et al . experimental animal clearly show inhibition myocardial aortic fibrosis , nephrosclerotic cerebrovascular lesion aldosterone inhibition occur absence change blood pressure . In human , RALES EPHESUS study , mortality effect occur absence fall blood pressure . In patient control hypertension diabetic nephropathy , group relevant work propose application , high dose spironolactone treatment ( 100 mg per day ) result fall either systolic diastolic blood pressure reduce albuminuria independently blood pressure . Finally , Professor Struthers , national authority aldosterone cardiovascular system , show trial spironolactone severe heart failure diabetes , fall blood pressure occur spironolactone suggest beneficial action spironolactone endothelial function mediate effect . ( personal communication ) . Nevertheless , effect mediate reduction blood pressure exclude . In order examine hypothesis , examine relationship magnitude change end point change blood pressure . The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system chronic renal failure : The importance RAAS CRF illustrate efficacy ACE inhibitor retard progression diabetic non-diabetic renal disease . The significance ANG II mediate renal damage show finding combine treatment ACE inhibitor ARBs slow progression non-diabetic renal disease compare either agent alone . Plasma aldosterone concentration increase animal model CRF well patient even mild renal impairment several line evidence point major role aldosterone promote progressive renal dysfunction . Observational study patient primary hyperaldosteronism find prevalence degree proteinuria great patient essential hypertension . Several experimental animal model consistent concept aldosterone mediate renal injury . In patient diabetic nephropathy aldosterone escape despite ACE inhibitor therapy , aldosterone blockade significantly reduce proteinuria change blood pressure . Little attention pay however , potentially beneficial effect aldosterone antagonism cardiovascular system renal failure . In single , small uncontrolled study 13 patient diabetic nephropathy establish ACE inhibitor therapy , leave ventricular mass index significantly reduce 24 week treatment spironolactone . Left ventricular hypertrophy arterial stiffness endpoint study chronic renal failure : LVH : Up 80 % patient LVH start dialysis . As patient group , LVH powerful independent predictor mortality CRF regression LVH associate improved cardiac outcome . Arterial stiffness : Large conduit artery buffer change pressure result intermittent ventricular ejection . Stiffening artery ( loss arterial compliance ) lead increase systolic pulse pressure ; indeed arterial stiffness principal determinant pulse pressure patient CRF . It also closely associate LVH progression time . Recent prospective study demonstrate measure aortic stiffness , aortic pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , augmentation central aortic pressure early wave reflection ( AIx ) , independent powerful predictor all-cause cardiovascular mortality patient dialysis . Indeed , recent prospective study , lower aortic PWV , mainly use ACE-inhibitor , associate improved survival dialysis patient . This reduction aortic PWV associate parallel reduction mean arterial pulse pressure survivor . In contrast , die cardiovascular event , although mean arterial pressure lower extent survivor ; neither pulse pressure aortic PWV significantly modify ACE inhibition . These finding suggest arterial stiffness merely marker arterial damage potentially reversible factor contribute mortality . In summary : Activation RAAS occur early course renal disease angiotensin aldosterone likely important factor pathogenesis arterial stiffness , LVH autonomic dysfunction . ACE inhibitor reduce arterial stiffness LVH well progression renal dysfunction level circulate aldosterone may remain high effect aldosterone inhibition unknown .</detailed_description>
