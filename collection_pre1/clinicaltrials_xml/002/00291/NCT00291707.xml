	<brief_title>Trial Cetuximab Pemetrexed With Radiation Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase I study determine safety effectiveness two chemotherapy drug , Cetuximab Pemetrexed ( Alimta ) , give combination radiation therapy . Currently Pemetrexed approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) two type cancer , mesothelioma lung cancer , consider investigational approve FDA head neck cancer . Cetuximab approve FDA treatment colorectal cancer ; however , yet approve head neck cancer . Pemetrexed drug kill tumor cell stop cell function normally . It study thousand subject show effective kill tumor cell many cancer , include head neck cancer . In preclinical study , Pemetrexed show promising activity wide range tumor type include mention well breast , colon , bladder cancer . Cetuximab ( also know `` C225 '' `` Erbitux '' ) increase effectiveness standard treatment chemotherapy radiation . Cetuximab type drug know monoclonal antibody . Monoclonal antibody use try destroy type cancer cell cause little harm normal cell . They design recognize specific molecule surface particular cancer cell . The monoclonal antibody recognize protein lock onto . This may trigger body 's immune system attack cancer cell sometimes make cell destroy . Cetuximab target epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , important molecule growth cancer cell . The use radiation therapy Cetuximab also study good result . We find effect ( good bad ) Cetuximab head neck cancer . Both Cetuximab Pemetrexed study intensively determine effectiveness . In study , find effect ( good bad ) Cetuximab Pemetrexed , radiation ; head neck cancer . We find combination Cetuximab , Pemetrexed radiation well result ordinarily expect radiation chemotherapy . We also find side effect worse usually see . In addition , test blood tumor tissue determine effect Cetuximab specimen . Finally , look `` marker , '' cancer identifier , tumor cell blood may help predict best treatment head neck cancer patient future .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirm head neck malignancy All subject require radiotherapy head neck poorprognosis malignancy eligible . Two cohort subject : prior history head neck radiation , i.e . nonirradiated prior history head neck radiation , i.e . previously irradiate . Subjects recurrent head neck cancer clinically measurable distant disease well subject distant disease low volume local regional palliation clinically warrant eligible . Subjects without prior treatment stage IV disease ( see AJCC stag system Appendix 2 , Protocol ) expect longterm survival le 10 % . No prior treatment systemic antiEGFR inhibitor Pemetrexed . Any number prior systemic therapy allow . Measurable evaluable disease . ECOG performance status 02 . Age ³ 18 year . Subjects must fully recover effect prior surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy . A minimum time period 4 week elapse completion prior chemotherapy enrollment study . ANC ³ 1500/µl , platelet count ³ 100,000/µl . Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL . Creatinine clearance 45 ml/min high calculate use CockcroftGault formula : Calculated Creatinine Clearance = ( 140age ) X actual body wt . ( kg ) 72 X serum creatinine Multiply number 0.85 subject female Total bilirubin within normal limit AST/ALT less 3 time upper limit normal ( less 5 time upper limit normal presence liver metastasis ) . Informed consent must obtain subject prior begin therapy . Subjects ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Subjects willing able take folic acid vitamin B12 supplementation interrupt aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent 5day period ( 8day period long act agent piroxicam ) , see section 5.57 Exclusion criterion : Subjects uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement , significant history uncontrolled cardiac disease ; i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction ( within prior 3 month ) , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy decrease ejection fraction . May receive investigational agent . Pregnant woman exclude . Breastfeeding discontinue mother treated chemotherapy . Prior study enrollment , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . In addition , men enrol study understand risk sexual partner childbearing potential practice effective method birth control . Subjects woman childbearing potential sexually active male must willing use effective contraception study . All WOCBP instruct contact Investigator immediately suspect might pregnant . HIVpositive subject exclude study . Prior grade 3 4 infusion hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody . For subject baseline clinically significant pleural peritoneal effusion initiation protocol therapy , consideration give drain effusion prior start therapy due potential increase toxicity Pemetrexed setting .</criteria>
