	<brief_title>Neuropathic Pain Assessment Comparing Pregabalin Paroxetine Management MS-induced Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Objective : To determine effectiveness drug treatment management MS-induced neuropathic pain . Specific Objectives : - Comparatively assess effectiveness safety profile pregabalin ( Lyrica ) paroxetine ( Paxil ) manage MS-induced neuropathic pain . - Comparatively assess effectiveness pregabalin ( Lyrica ) paroxetine ( Paxil ) improve quality-of-life associate MS-induced neuropathic pain . Study Design : A comparative single center , randomize , open-label study involve patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) - induced neuropathic pain receive treatment either pregabalin ( Lyrica® ) paroxetine ( Paxil® ) . The study run approximately one year , require individual participant ' involvement 8 week . Participant Selection : Individuals clinically definite MS presenting symptom neuropathic pain ( determined clinician ) express interest study screen eligibility . Inclusion Criteria : - Patients present symptom neuropathic pain determine clinician , minimum VAS pain score 40mm determined baseline score ( 0mm = pain , 100mm = worst pain ) . - Male female patient age 18 65 year old . - Clinically definite multiple sclerosis define clinical history review , neurological examination positive MRI . - EDSS score &lt; 6.0 . - No known hypersensitivity study medication . - Negative serum pregnancy test female patient childbearing age ; currently breastfeed . - Not currently treat pregabalin , gabapentin , paroxetine another SSRI . - No previous treatment failure pregabalin paroxetine . - Baseline creatinine clearance ( Clcr ) &gt; 50mL/min . - No significant hepatic insufficiency . - If pain medication , must stable dose least 6 month medication must elicit significant drug-drug interaction study medication . Study Procedures : After obtain informed consent ( Visit 1 ) , participant undergo various assessment , include pain/quality-of-life analysis ( SF-MPQ , SF-36 , VAS ) , physical/neurological exam standard blood test . Based inclusion criterion , participant randomize either Group A ( paroxetine ) Group B ( pregabalin ) . Participants provide prescription assign study medication well dose instruction . A pain diary consist single VAS scale provide participant , complete daily upon wake use rate individual 's average pain last 24 hour . Dosages study medication titrate slowly 3 week low likelihood adverse event . After three week titration phase , participant return clinic ( Visit 2 ) follow-up . Pain/quality-of-life assessment ( Visit 1 ) complete visit . In addition , average pain score determine daily pain diary . Adverse event discuss individual tolerability assess . At point , determine patient maintain target dosage dosage lower accommodate patient tolerability . Participants maintain determined maintenance dose 5 week , return clinic ( Visit 3 ) final follow-up assessment . Participants complete final pain/quality-of-life assessment , well `` Patient-rated Global Impression Change '' . Adverse event average pain score review . At conclusion 8-week treatment phase , participant option remain current study medication taper .</detailed_description>
