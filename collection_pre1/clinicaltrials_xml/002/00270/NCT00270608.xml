	<brief_title>How Does Early Age Life Style Affect Bone Strength General Health Parameters Middle Age ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone strength peak bone mass preliminary determine genetic factor . Life style , especially exercise , also consider important effect bone strength . Bone ability strengthen accord Wolff 's Law . When bone subject strain and/or strain rate higher usual , respond remodel , strengthen architecture . The ability great young individual decrease age . In elderly ability largely non-existent bone mass lose . Whether loss lead osteoporosis largely function peak bone mass achieve decline . 11 % male 44 % female 50 suffer osteoporosis later life . To extent vigorous exercise begin young age increase bone strength know . The purpose propose research quantify effect life style bone strength general health parameter compare two male population , one sedentary do demand physical training : ( 1 ) Elite infantry recruit induct I.D.F . Feb 1983 , basic training Sanur part 1983 stress fracture project complete three year elite infantry service continue serve combat soldier reserve ; ( 2 ) Yeshiva student profile 82 97 receive deferment military service 1983 since continue study never serve army . 50 subject review group . Measurements weight , height , waist abdominal girth , rest pulse blood pressure make . The brachial/ankle blood pressure index record . MRI right knee study potential degenerate change do use 1.5 Tesla General Electric Signa MR scanner . Quantitative Computed Tomography ( QCT ) , one popular effective method utilized osteoporosis screening , perform determine volumetric BMD , BMC , bone geometric property strength index tibia lumbar spine . Comparisons : Group I : 50 male ( age 41-45 ) , former elite Israeli infantry soldier , select randomly recruit infantry basic training Sanur Feb. 1983 ( profile 82 97 ) complete military service combat soldier compare : Group II : 50 age- , profile- ethnically-matched Israeli citizen whose military service defer 1983 Torah study army service involve kind physical training .</detailed_description>
