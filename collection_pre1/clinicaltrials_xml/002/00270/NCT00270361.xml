	<brief_title>FUSION I Assesses Safety Tolerability Two Doses NATRECOR ( Nesiritide ) Administered Patients With Worsening Congestive ( Decompensated ) Heart Failure Who Are Concurrently Receiving Their Usual Cardiac Medications Are High Risk Hospitalization .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efforts contain rise cost hospital acute care result short hospital stay patient acutely decompensated heart failure . These short stay may allow adequate diuresis , titration oral medication , patient receive full benefit intravenously ( IV ) administer medication . In addition shorter stay hospitalize , physician explore way treat patient outpatient set avoid hospitalization . Although increase interest among clinician use outpatient IV therapy treatment advance heart failure , consensus among clinician regard patient selection , dose , treatment duration . The use IV inotropic agent ( drug influence affect muscle contractility ) milrinone dobutamine set controversial may lead increased mortality . Indeed , ACC/AHA ( American College Cardiology American Hospital Association ) guideline warn long-term intermittent use IV inotropes treatment leave ventricular dysfunction `` unproved value recommend . '' Yet , despite guideline , clinician use inotropes outpatient set currently approve alternative therapy . Thus , unmet need effective outpatient treatment advance chronic heart failure improve quality life and/or reduce number hospital admission heart failure . The data previous study suggest dos NATRECOR速 hBNP may potent agent treatment acute congestive heart failure ( CHF ) unique combination desirable effect flow blood throughout body ; hormone secrete nervous system support copious salt output renal system provide currently available therapy . This study multicenter , open-label pilot study subject receive treatment acutely decompensated CHF hospitalization least twice within previous 12 month randomize ( 1:1:1 ) one three treatment group . One treatment group receive usual long term cardiac medication , either without serial infusion inotropes ( various drug affect strength contraction heart muscle ) without nesiritide therapy . The 0.005 mcg/kg/min nesiritide treatment group receive 0.5 mcg/kg bolus nesiritide follow 0.0025 mcg/kg/min infusion , addition usual long term cardiac medication , exclude IV inotropes ; The 0.010 mcg/kg/min nesiritide treatment group receive 1 mcg/kg bolus nesiritide follow 0.005 mcg/kg infusion , addition usual long term cardiac medication , exclude IV inotropes . Because patient treated outpatient setting may less decompensated patient acutely decompensated heart failure , study design evaluate 0.010 mcg/kg/min dose nesiritide ( currently approve dose acutely decompensated patient ) well low dose ( 0.005 mcg/kg/min ) . The hypothesis adjunct therapy oral medication , serial IV infusion nesiritide may produce rapid sustain compensation heart failure patient frequent episode decompensated heart failure . The 0.005 mcg/kg/min group receive 0.5 mcg/kg bolus follow 0.0025 mcg/kg/min infusion ; 0.010 mcg/kg/min group receive 1 mcg/kg bolus follow 0.005 mcg/kg infusion . Intravenous bolus 60 second fix rate infusion 4 - 6 hour , least per week 12 week .</detailed_description>
