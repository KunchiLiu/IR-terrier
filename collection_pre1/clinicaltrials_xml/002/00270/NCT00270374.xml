	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Blood Flow Clinical Safety Effects Addition Natrecor ( Nesiritide ) , Placebo Intravenous Nitroglycerin Standard Care Treatment Worsening Congestive Heart Failure .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced congestive heart failure ( CHF ) account 1 million hospital admission yearly U.S. also associate high rate readmission hospital within short turn-around time period follow discharge . CHF associate relatively high death rate , 40 50 % 2 year . The risk sudden cardiac death patient CHF 6 9 time great general population . Despite medical advance , patient unresponsive oral medication use treat CHF require add therapy . Such patient typically New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV , require intravenous ( IV ) therapy inotropic agent . Inotropic agent drug influence muscular contractility . IV administration inotropic drug require careful patient selection close monitoring ensure safe effective therapy . There many medical condition lead worsen CHF underlying condition contribute significant potentially life-threatening loss cardiac function . Some condition lead abnormal cardiac contraction and/or relaxation ( e.g. , coronary arterial disease , hypertension , diabetes , drug alcohol toxicity ) ; condition lead volume pressure overload ( mitral tricuspid valve regurgitation , hyperthyroidism ) ; condition limit ventricle filling ( e.g. , mitral tricuspid valve stenosis ) . However , many patient condition dilate cardiomyopathy , abnormality heart muscle wall wall heart become stretch weakened , easily identifiable cause . Any risk factor may cause CHF , combination dramatically increase risk develop CHF . Natriuretic peptide ANP BNP small molecule group naturally-occuring substance act body oppose activity renin-angiotensin-aldosterone ( RAA ) system . They serve counter-regulatory hormone secrete response increase atrial ventricular stretch occurs secondary increase blood volume . Natrecor ( nesiritide ) proprietary name IV formulation human B-type natriuretic peptide ( hBNP ) . In-patient treatment acutely decompensated CHF intravenous vasodilator therapy ( nitroglycerin nitroprusside ) useful number reason . Vasodilators reduce ventricular filling pressure volume , decrease pulmonary congestion result symptom breathlessness . Intravenous vasodilator may also achieve afterload reduction lead decreased mitral regurgitation increase forward stroke volume . IV administration externally produce hBNP lead vasodilation , antagonism renin-aldosterone system increase diuresis . hBNP may potent agent treatment CHF , unique combination desirable blood flow throughout body , hormone secrete sympathetic nervous system , renal effect possess currently available therapy . In 6-hour placebo-controlled comparison patient acutely decompensated CHF , Natrecor® associate significant improvement symptom CHF ( include dyspnea fatigue ) , decrease aldosterone , increase urine output . ( According LeJemtel et al 1998 ) The VMAC trial ( Vasodilation Management Acute CHF ) double-blinded , randomize , active-controlled placebo-controlled study study drug would add standard care therapy diuretic , dobutamine , dopamine . This study compare effect addition Natrecor® , nitroglycerin , placebo standard care ( diuretic , dobutamine , dopamine , long-term cardiac therapy ) patient require hospitalization treatment dyspnea rest due acutely decompensated CHF . Based cumulative experience Natrecor , dose Natrecor modify VMAC trial 2-µg/kg bolus follow 0.01-µg/kg/min infusion . The primary objective VMAC study compare blood flow observe treatment safety effect new dose Natrecor placebo , add standard care , treatment acutely worsen CHF . The primary overall outcome study plan base upon change begin study 3 hour start study drug , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) ( subject right heart catheter ) subject 's self-evaluation breathing difficulty . The secondary objective compare hemodynamic , ( blood flow throughout body ) clinical effect Natrecor® IV nitroglycerin placebo . Additional objective include comparison use IV vasoactive agent and/or IV diuretic effect hemodynamic variable . The hypothesis study use modify dose Natrecor , ( 2-µg/kg bolus follow 0.01-µg/kg/min infusion ) achieve peak effect sooner previously study dos , sustain effect least 48 hour , minimize excessive effect blood pressure . Natrecor placebo , administer intravenous 2-µg/kg bolus , follow fixed-dose infusion 0.01-µg/kg/min .</detailed_description>
