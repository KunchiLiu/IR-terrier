	<brief_title>Efficacy Double Wire Technique Difficult Cases Common Bile Duct Cannulation ERCP ( UDOGUIA-04 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complications associate ERCP related certain characteristic procedure . One number attempt selective biliary cannulation . Our hypothesis double guide wire placement could useful technique selective biliary cannulation case difficult ERCP procedure , reduce number cannulation attempt complication associate procedure . We conduct control prospective multicentre randomize study compare double guide wire technique conventional method two group previously randomize presenting difficult selective biliary cannulation conventional method . The study carry six public Hospitals Spain . Assignation conceal group , expect study period 18 month number randomize patient equal 262 ( statistical power 90 % Î±-error 0.05 , detect success rate 74 % group undergo double guide wire technique success rate 60 % control group ) . The main outcome variable successful selective biliary cannulation ( primary outcome variable ) , number attempt morbimortality associate group ( secondary outcome variable ) .</detailed_description>
