	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Immune Response LC002 , Experimental Therapeutic Vaccine , Adults Receiving HAART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) dramatically improve rate survival , morbidity , mortality among HIV-infected people throughout world . However , cost , long-term toxicity , problem adherence associate HAART regimen make treatment plan less optimal individual seek treatment HIV infection . Also , viral reservoir eradicate , HIV-infected people must usually HAART indefinitely order keep infection control . While mechanism still unclear , immune system weaken HIV disease progress . A therapeutic HIV vaccine give HIV infected people may help promote good immune response . LC002 novel HIV therapeutic vaccine contain DNA plasmid cod HIV-1 's protein . LC002 unique vaccine give topical administration ; allow Langerhans cell ( immune cell locate surface skin ) pick vaccine deliver lymph node , cause immune reaction . This study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity LC002 HIV-infected adult currently receive HAART . There three cohort study enrol sequentially . Participants give cohort randomly assign receive either LC002 ( 6 participant ) placebo ( 2 participant ) . - In Cohort 1 , participant receive three separate low-dose vaccination LC002 ( Arm A : 0.1 mg DNA/participant , 0.8 ml total , administer two skin site 80 cm^2 , 0.4 ml/site ) 3 separate vaccination placebo ( Arm B : 0.8 ml total , administer two skin site 80 cm^2 , 0.4 ml/site ) . Vaccinations give two skin site leave right upper back . Participants receive vaccination week 1 , 7 , 13 . - In Cohort 2 , participant receive three separate high-dose vaccination LC002 ( Arm C : 0.4 mg DNA/participant , 3.2 ml total , administer four skin sit 80 cm^2 , 0.8 ml/site ) three separate vaccination placebo ( Arm D : 3.2 ml total , administer four skin sit 80 cm^2 , 0.8 ml/site ) . Vaccinations give four skin site leave right upper back leave right upper ventral thigh . Participants receive vaccination week 1 , 7 , 13 . - In Cohort 3 , participant receive six separate high-dose vaccination LC002 ( Arm E : 0.4 mg DNA/participant , 3.2 ml total , administer four skin sit 80 cm^2 , 0.8 ml/site ) six vaccination placebo ( Arm F : 3.2 ml total , administer four skin sit 80 cm^2 , 0.8 ml/site ) . Vaccinations give four skin site leave right upper back leave right upper ventral thigh . Participants receive vaccination study entry week 1 , 6 , 7 , 12 , 13 . The decision open next cohort make participant current cohort remain study &gt; =14 day second vaccination prematurely discontinue study primary safety endpoint ( see primary outcome measure definition ) . Dose escalation require primary safety endpoint on-study follow-up &gt; =6 participant previous cohort ( ) . Prior receive vaccine , choose vaccine administration site back thigh disinfect exfoliate . A skin patch apply site , vaccine solution place skin underneath patch needleless syringe . Participants allow remove skin patch 3 hour post vaccination . For first second vaccination , participant require remain clinic 3 hour post-vaccination study staff assess side effect . If side effect occur first two vaccination , participant require stay clinic 30 minute receive late vaccination . At start study , participant ask keep diary record daily side effect skin irritation may experience follow vaccination . Participants require bring diary next clinic visit . Two day vaccination , participant followed-up phone ask side effect may experience . Participants experience side effect ask return clinic examination . There 13 study visit ; occur study entry Weeks 1 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 24 , 37 , 61 . Study visit include medication history , physical exam , collection diary . Blood urine collection occur select visit . HAART provide study .</detailed_description>
