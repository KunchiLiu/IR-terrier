	<brief_summary>Despite preclinical evidence support role endogenous opioid system reinforce effect nicotine , efficacy opioid antagonist naltrexone ( NTX ) tobacco dependence treatment remain unresolved . Research need identify smoker NTX strong beneficial effect smoke behavior . The research bridge exist knowledge genetic , pharmacologic , behavioral response nicotine , translate knowledge treatment tobacco dependence . The immediate goal test whether genetic variation mu-opioid receptor gene predict effect naltrexone ( NTX ) nicotine reinforcement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study within-subject double-blind study effect naltrexone versus placebo reinforce value nicotine , use validate cigarette choice paradigm . A key question whether smoker differ response base mu opioid receptor gene ( OPRM1 ) Asn40Asp ( A118G ) variant . Following informed consent , 64 smoker enrol study . Of , 60 complete two 4-day study phase intersperse 5-7 day washout phase . Baseline statistic provide 64 smoker enrol . Each 4-day study phase include 3-day drug run-up monitoring phase , 4th day participant come Biobehavioral Lab ( BBL ) take final 50mg study medication complete cigarette choice paradigm .
