	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : Daily consumption almonds 16 week produce decrease hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) level adult pre-diabetes . Lay Summary : Persons develop type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) typically first condition call pre-diabetes . Lifestyle major factor determine whether pre-diabetes becomes full T2DM . Lifestyle include dietary habit physical activity . Many people develop T2DM poor dietary habit sedentary lifestyle . Moreover , eat high-fat , high-sugar diet damage blood vessel increase risk stroke heart attack . A person 's diet may produce substance blood interfere production insulin pancreas . Sometimes , change insulin produce cell serious eventually interfere cell body use blood sugar , cause T2DM . Techniques available measure circulate substance blood person pre-diabetes may associate development T2DM . Laboratory research show almonds contain high level important compound may influence onset heart disease T2DM . A meal plan include almonds daily give half study participant participant give meal plan `` nut-free '' . Because potential delay onset heart disease T2DM persons pre-diabetes , 16-week study collect analyze blood sample change may make person pre-diabetes likely develop heart disease T2DM . Blood sample collect week 0 , 8 16 measure compound may influence consume almond daily . This study also attempt understand possible cause heart disease T2DM persons pre-diabetes ; particularly might relate body weight body composition . Body composition technique use small amount electrical current available study body fat . Body weight , waist hip measurement , blood pressure body composition test perform start study every 4 week study . Lastly , possible cause heart disease T2DM investigate look relationship substance blood .</brief_summary>
