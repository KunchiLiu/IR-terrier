	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Epoetin Alfa Its Effectiveness Facilitating Presurgical Collection Blood From Anemic Patients Possible Self-transfusion During After Scheduled Joint Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major surgical procedure may require transfusion several unit blood . Blood transfusion people may associate transfusion reaction cause fever infection hepatitis AIDS carry ( donate ) blood . However , self-donations blood may cause anemia patient undergo surgery week later . Previous research epoetin alfa suggest epoetin alfa increase rate red blood cell production decrease anemia . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study design determine whether epoetin alfa patient low hematocrit ( red blood cell percentage &lt; 39 percent ) stimulate bone marrow produce red blood cell therefore increase patient 's ability self-donate blood prior major surgery joint disease . Patients randomly assign receive either 600 unit epoetin alfa per kilogram body weight match placebo , inject vein first study day , every 3 4 day thereafter 21 day . Effectiveness determine number unit self-donated blood collect , number unit donor blood use time surgery , red blood cell percentages surgery . Safety evaluation include incidence adverse event , physical examination , clinical laboratory test perform throughout study . The study hypothesis patient treat epoetin alfa able donate unit blood 3 week prior surgery , need few donor-donated unit blood , high level red blood cell patient receive placebo . 600 unit epoetin alfa per kilogram body weight , equivalent volume placebo , inject vein every 3 4 day 21 day ( 6 dos ) period surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients schedule surgery involve joint , 25 35 day start epoetin alfa therapy hematocrit ( percentage red cell blood ) &lt; =39 % good general health . Patients history primary blood disease history artery blockage heart , body brain , history seizure , uncontrolled high blood pressure , active inflammatory disease , ( except osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis ) lose blood internally stomach intestine elsewhere body use cell toxic drug , drug suppress immune system , drug know influence red blood cell production ( chemotherapy cancer ) within 1 month therapy folate vitamin B12 deficiency , irondeficiency anemia , disease destroys blood cell .</criteria>
