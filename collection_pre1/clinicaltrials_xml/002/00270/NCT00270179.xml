	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether epoetin alfa stimulate bone marrow produce red blood cell therefore increase patient 's ability self-donate blood prior major surgery . Epoetin alfa genetically engineer protein stimulates red blood cell production .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Epoetin Alfa During Period When One Donating One 's Own Blood Before Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major surgical procedure may require several unit blood . Blood transfusion people may associate transfusion reaction cause fever uncommonly , blood-borne infection . However , self-blood collection may cause anemia patient undergo surgery week later . Previous research epoetin alfa suggest increase rate red blood cell production beneficial effect anemia . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled 21-day study design determine whether intravenous epoetin alfa stimulate patient 's bone marrow produce red blood cell therefore increase patient 's ability self-donate blood prior major surgery joint disease . Patients randomly assign receive either epoetin alfa 600 unit per kilogram body weight matching volume placebo inject vein first study day every 3 4 day thereafter 21 day , total 6 dos . The primary measure effectiveness determine number unit blood obtained patient study , change hemoglobin hematocrit pre-study post-study , number transfusion require around time surgery . Safety evaluate base laboratory test , vital sign , incidence severity adverse unusual experience associate drug administration . The study hypothesis patient treat epoetin alfa able donate unit blood surgery receive epoetin alfa patient receive placebo . Epoetin alfa 600 unit per kilogram equal volume placebo inject vein first day study , every 3 4 day thereafter day 21 , total 6 dos .</detailed_description>
