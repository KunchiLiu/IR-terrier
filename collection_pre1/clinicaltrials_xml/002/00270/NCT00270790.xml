	<brief_summary>Purpose study : There evidence best treatment head neck cancer involve combination radiation therapy chemotherapy . Radiation therapy form cancer treatment use high energy x-ray . Chemotherapy form cancer treatment use special medication . This study use two chemotherapy drug ( Taxol Carboplatin ) , FDA approve treat head neck cancer . This treatment combination associate difficulty , pain , burn sensation upon swallow ( call esophagitis ) , decrease blood cell ( cell blood fight infection ) . The purpose study investigate whether addition another drug , Amifostine , reduce side effect current combination treatment ( radiation chemotherapy standard care ) . The addition Amifostine investigational part study . The research study also look side effect Amifostine cancer 's growth response combination treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EVALUATION OF AMIFOSTINE FOR MUCOSAL AND HEMOPOETIC PROTECTION AND CARBOPLATIN , TAXOL , RADIOTHERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK CANCER . ( GCC 0202 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients present locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) continue represent significant therapeutic challenge . The bulk tumor burden often prove overwhelming conventional radiotherapy . Attempts improve upon poor outcome lead investigator explore several new strategy , one chemoradiation . One trial conduct University Maryland carboplatin paclitaxel daily radiation show 82 % CR primary site . But commonly encounter grade 3 toxicity mucositis ( 70 % ) , leukopenia ( 30 % ) 3 % grade 4 leukopenia . Amifostine : An organic thiophosphate radioprotective show protect experimental animal lethal dose radiation . Clinical trial demonstrate amifostine provide protection hematological toxicity mucositis see various chemotherapeutic agent . Theoretically , drug interaction amifostine chemotherapeutic agent likely occur , due amifostine¿s rapid clearance plasma ( 90 % drug clear within 6 minute ) . A promising venue would investigation amifostine¿s role reduce toxicity associate chemoradiation ( standard care treat squamous cell carcinoma head neck ) . Principal objectives study : Primary : To evaluate whether addition radioprotector amifostine reduce incidence severity mucositis hematological toxicity cause chemoradiation . Secondary : 1.To determine toxicity amifostine give set . 2 . To determine response rate regimen population .</detailed_description>
