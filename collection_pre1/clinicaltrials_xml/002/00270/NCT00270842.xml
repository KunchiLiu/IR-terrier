	<detailed_description>Since 1970 's , researcher epidemiologist document patient fall high-risk , high volume , high cost adverse event contribute morbidity , mortality , decrease quality life , premature nursing home placement . Despite thousand research study publish patient fall , study focus effectiveness intervention , fall rate associated injury among elderly continue rise . Impaired gait balance ( refer impair stability ) one significant cause consequence fall . Persons peripheral neuropathy represent one large patient population impaired stability . Lower limb peripheral neuropathy ( LLPN ) include sensory motor impairment result impaired gait balance , jeopardize safe mobility . Emerging evidence suggest exercise program effective improve gait balance general fall risk population , well reduce fall fall-related injury . Exercise intervention design reduce fall risk promote successful aging . These intervention come many form , common intervention exercise train Tai Chi , offer individually small group format . Further research need gain insight underlie mechanism different type exercise impact stability veteran LLPN . Research need determine type combination type exercise produce normal and/or stable gait high-risk patient population . Researchers begin document exercise intervention positively influence person 's fall self efficacy , i.e . self confidence avoid fall , important factor understand examine person ' behavior relate fall risk . The emphasis functionally base intervention lead inappropriate broad grouping old person mobility disorder . A weakness previous study aggregate heterogeneous patient population , result neurological musculoskeletal diagnostic heterogeneity confound result . Focusing homogeneous patient population necessary distinguish unique sensory , gait balance deficit contribute impaired stability mobility risk , well well understand unique response treatment cloud diverse patient aggregate . We target veteran LLPN -- one large group patient refer Falls Clinic , understudied population respect safe patient mobility . This allow u design target intervention likely effective test heterogeneous elderly population , visual vestibular input compensate impaired proprioception take account . The goal study improve successful adaptation age quality life veteran low limb peripheral neuropathy ( LLPN ) . Functional Balance Training Tai Chi , two exercise intervention test study , document improve gait balance , decrease fall associate fall-related injury general elderly population . We interest whether one exercise intervention ( successful general elderly population ) would effective special subpopulation elderly , namely person LLPN . The purpose study compare effectiveness two exercise intervention education control group . Effectiveness assess study impact intervention ( 1 ) composite measure stability ( gait balance ) , ( 2 ) fall self-efficacy , ( 3 ) patient acceptance . Given well-documented link fall fall-related injury ( ultimate outcome ) study focus stability ( intermediate outcome ) . Because fall fall-related injury relatively rare event , examine stability outcome allow u sufficient power test hypotheses relatively small sample size thereby decrease cost duration study without sacrifice rigor research design .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Corrected vision worse 20/50 visual acuity read follow instruction . Ability ambulate household distance without assistive device . This reflect minimum functional status ambulation primary mode mobility . Symptoms Signs consistent LLPN determine Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Scale ( Score great 6 , presence mild PN ) . The Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score quantifies sensory impairment , muscle strength , reflex , use vibration , filament , pin prick , physical touch . Scale range 046 , high score indicate great severity PN . The score use stratify severity PN , take approximately 1015 minute complete . Testing aspect elicit sensation small moderate nerve fiber , sensitive mild moderate sensory neuropathy . This test select rather gold standard EMG order screen study subject , less invasive , reduces burden subject screen inclusion study . Cognitive impairment MMSE score less 24 , level 24 score indicate cognitive impairment , limit ability remember instruction . Metastatic cancer , limit ability complete intensity duration study . Central neurological dysfunction e.g . diagnosis hemiparesis , cerebellar dysfunction , Parkinson 's disease determine medical record review . These neurological impairment impair gait balance , would jeopardize safety randomize intervention group . Lower extremity amputation , physical disability result alter postural balance . Lower extremity abnormality peripheral neuropathy , foot drop , participation class would compromise patient safety . Mobility limitation due alter low extremity skin integrity/ulcer , pain would limit gait weightbearing would contraindicate stasis foot ulcer claudication . Medically unstable upon exam , i.e . poorly control blood pressure blood sugar , coronary artery disease , group participation would compromise medical status .</criteria>
