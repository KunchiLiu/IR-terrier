	<criteria>Patients metastatic breast cancer , histologically proven Patients receive taxane base chemotherapy result PR CR , thus measurable disease start taxane therapy ( RECIST ) No 2 line ( taxanes include ) metastatic setting Patients receive least 10 week taxane therapy ( 4 cycle 3weekly therapy 8 weekly administration ) 20 week treatment ( 6 cycle 3weekly therapy 16 weekly administration ) . 6 cycle 3weekly taxanes 1216 cycle weekly taxanes recommend . Last taxane administration 3 4 week 3 weekly taxane 2 3 week weekly taxanes Performance status 0 1 ECOG scale ( Appendix A ) Age &gt; 18 year Adequate organ function define : Serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ; serum glutamateoxalate transferase [ SGOT ] ) serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ; serum glutamatepyruvate transferase [ SGPT ] ) ≤2.5 x central laboratory upper limit normal ( CLULN ) . If liver function abnormality due underlying malignancy , AST ALT may ≤5 x CLULN Prothrombin time ( PT ) &gt; 50 % Serum albumin ≥3.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500/µL Platelets ≥100,000/µL Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x CLULN Serum amylase lipase ≤1.0 x CLULN Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) low limit normal ( LLN ) assess multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiography . Absence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ; condition discuss patient registration trial Before patient registration/randomization , write informed consent must give accord ICH/GCP , national/local regulation . Her2 neu positive tumor IHC 3+ FISH+ Concurrent hormone therapy ( tamoxifen , aromatase inhibitor , hormone suppress therapy ) SU11248 . Concurrent treatment hormonal replacement therapy Concurrent treatment anticancer therapy . Bisphosphonates allow . Concurrent treatment experimental drug . Participation another clinical trial investigational market drug within 20 day prior study entry . Previous trial antiangiogenic drug allow . Chronic treatment steroid unless initiate &gt; 6 month prior study entry low dose ( &lt; 20 mg methylprednisolone daily equivalent ) Diagnosis second malignancy within last 5 year , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ carcinoma cervix uterus . Any follow within 12 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis , thromboembolic event . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE grade ≥2 , atrial fibrillation grade , prolongation QTc interval &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness . Pregnancy breastfeed . Patients must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception period therapy . All female patient reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) within 7 day prior enrollment . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
