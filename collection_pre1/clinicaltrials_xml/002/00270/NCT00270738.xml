	<brief_summary>Urinary incontinence ( UI ) complaint involuntary leakage urine . Stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) complaint involuntary leakage effort exertion , sneeze coughing . The prevalence female UI great male , commonest type SUI . UI significant impact quality life include physical , mental social issue . SUI may also lead withdraw regular physical exercise fitness activity important prevention osteoporosis , coronary heart disease , . The cause SUI relate impairment pelvic floor muscle ( PFM ) . So far , effect intensive pelvic floor muscle train female SUI prove many randomize controlled trial . However , train accurate contraction PFM depend vaginal palpation . The willingness seek medical help may reduce due embarrass vaginal palpation . Sapsford propose concept treat SUI via transversus abdominis ( TrA ) need palpate vagina . Maybe new intervention promote willingness seek medical help . However , date randomize control trial compare effect indirect training PFM via TrA either untreated control intervention . Therefore , two purpose study , compare effect indirect training PFM via TrA control group compare effect indirect training PFM via TrA PFMT female SUI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In first period ( part I ) , 100 woman SUI recruit study randomize intervention control group stratify move direction PFM contraction TrA . All subject evaluate pre- post- 4-month intervention . The measurement include basic data comprehensive urogynaecological history , woman 's observation , quantification symptom , clinician 's measure quality life . Women control group receive customary information PFM exercise decide receive intensive pelvic floor muscle train control period . The intervention group follow specially design exercise course include diaphragmatic breathing , tonic activation , muscle strengthening , functional expiratory pattern impact activity . They individually train physical therapist 30-60 minute eight time intervention period . In second period ( part II ) , another 100 woman SUI recruit study randomize intervention control group . All subject evaluate pre- post- 4-month intervention . The measurement include basic data comprehensive urogynaecological history , woman 's observation , quantification symptom , clinician 's measure quality life . Women control group receive customary information PFM exercise decide receive intensive pelvic floor muscle train control period . The intervention group receive intensive pelvic floor muscle training . They individually train physical therapist 30-60 minute eight time intervention period . Descriptive inferential statistic complete use SPSS window , version 11.0 . Descriptive statistic compute subject demographic . Normality evaluate use Shapiro-Wilk test variable . The confound factor two group test independent t-test Chi-square test . A two-way mixed analysis variance ( ANOVA ) Friedman test use ass possible difference pre- post- intervention two group .
