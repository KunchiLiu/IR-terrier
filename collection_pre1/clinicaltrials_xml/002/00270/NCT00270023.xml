	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness epoetin alfa whether epoetin alfa enable self-donation blood 11-day period surgery ( short conventional 3-week blood donation period surgery ) patient anemic undergoing orthopedic , heart blood vessel , breast reduction surgery . Epoetin alfa genetically engineer protein stimulates red blood cell production . Normovolemic hemodilution ( NVHD , withdrawal patient 's blood immediately surgery , immediate replacement blood equal volume fluid , return withdraw blood completion surgery ; procedure reduce loss blood surgery ) also perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Determine Effectiveness Epoetin Alfa Facilitating Self-donation Blood Before Surgery Non-anemic Patients Who Are Undergoing Orthopedic , Heart Blood Vessel , Breast Reduction Surgery ; Performed Combination With Procedure Reduce Blood Loss During Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo surgery frequently require blood transfusion operation . Patients often blood collect purpose standard 3- 4-week presurgical period . However , large percentage patient able pre-donate blood transfusion . Agents facilitate self-donation less time conventional 3 week surgery reduce need transfusion others , may improve overall safety surgery . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multicenter study determine whether epoetin alfa enable self-donation least 4 unit blood shorten presurgical time period 11 day surgery ( short period time conventional 3 week blood donation period surgery ) patient anemic undergoing orthopedic , heart blood vessel , breast reduction surgery . The study consist 7-day screening period patient test eligibility study ; 11-day treatment , blood collection , evaluation period end Day 11 ( day surgery ) ; post-surgery follow-up period begin even Day 11 end final study visit time patient discharge hospital surgery . Patients randomly assign one four treatment group : epoetin alfa 300 units/kilogram ( U/kg ) , epoetin alfa 600 U/kg , placebo match volume epoetin alfa 300 U/kg , placebo match volume epoetin alfa 600 U/kg , give injection vein . Twice many patient receive treatment epoetin alfa receive treatment placebo . A total 3 dos study drug administer surgery ; one dose give Days 1 , 4 , 7 study . Additionally , Day 1 day hospital discharge , patient receive 200 milligram iron 5 milligram folate supplement daily mouth help body increase production red blood cell . On Day 1 , first dose study medication , one unit blood collect patient store self-donated blood transfusion . An additional unit blood obtain patient ( administration study drug ) store self-donated blood transfusion Days 4 , 7 , 11 ( day surgery , operation ) ; perform patient 's hemoglobin &gt; 11.0 g/dL . If patient 's hemoglobin lower 11.0 g/dL , blood collect patient day , although study drug continue give . Normovolemic hemodilution ( NVHD ) perform Day 11 , day surgery , operation . Safety evaluation include laboratory test , vital sign , record adverse event . Effectiveness assess compare number self-donated unit blood obtain within 11 day among 4 treatment group , secondarily compare change hemoglobin , immature red blood cell , erythropoietin ( red blood cell stimulate hormone ) level blood among 4 treatment group start study end study . The study hypothesis abbreviate time period surgery ( 11 day ) , epoetin alfa stimulate generation 4 unit self-donated blood patient anemic undergoing orthopedic , heart blood vessel , breast reduction surgery . Epoetin alfa 300 units/kilogram ( U/kg ) , epoetin alfa 600 U/kg , placebo , injection vein ; give Days 1 , 4 , 7 study .</detailed_description>
