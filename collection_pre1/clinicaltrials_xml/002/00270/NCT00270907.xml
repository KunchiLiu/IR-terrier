	<brief_title>CT-2103 Combination With Gemcitabine Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CT-2103 chemotherapy drug design deliver active chemotherapy medication ( paclitaxel ) inside tumor cell . Gemcitabine FDA approve treatment breast cancer . Before start receive drug study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam . You CT scan chest abdomen , bone scan , chest x-ray perform document size location tumor ( ) . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Women able child must negative blood-pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , assign dose CT-2103 . Participants study enrol group 3 . The first group receive low dose CT-2103 . Each new group patient receive high dose high safe dose find . The dose receive depend many patient receive CT-2103 . You assign one dose level , stay dose level entire study unless serious side effect require dose decreased stop . All participant receive dose gemcitabine , though may lower severe side effect occur . Both CT-2103 gemcitabine give vein . On first day therapy ( call 'Day 1 ' ) , receive routinely give medication , ondansetron ( Zofran ) , help decrease risk nausea . About 30 minute later , CT-2103 give 10-20 minute follow gemcitabine 30 minute . One week later ( 'Day 8 ' ) , receive gemcitabine vein 30 minute . You return see doctor 3 week first dose chemotherapy ( 'Day 21 ' ) , pattern cycle treatment give . You continue therapy long cancer control unexpected intolerable side effect . All chemotherapy give M. D. Anderson . You blood ( 2 tablespoon ) collect week study monitor effect chemotherapy bone marrow liver kidney function . You see doctor every 3 week monitor tolerate therapy . At visit , doctor discus symptom , physical exam . If take warfarin ( Coumadin ) need blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect three time week monitor warfarin level . After 6 week chemotherapy , repeat scan evaluate effect study drug upon cancer . Once stop take therapy CT-2103 gemcitabine , ask return see physician 6 week evaluate find additional change cancer . You complete medical history physical exam . You CT scan chest abdomen , bone scan , chest x-ray perform document size location tumor ( ) . This investigational study . Gemcitabine FDA approve treatment breast cancer give combination paclitaxel . Gemcitabine provide free charge . CT-2103 yet FDA approve provided free charge study . Any laboratory test standard care pay support company . About 18 woman take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Females childbearing potential defined female undergone hysterectomy postmenopausal least 24 month . 10 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; /= 3,000/ul ; absolute neutrophil count &gt; /= 1,500/ul ; platelet &gt; /= 100,000/ul ; total bilirubin within normal institutional limit ; aspartate aminotransferase ( AST SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT SGPT ) &lt; /= 2.5 * institutional upper limit normal ; creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance &gt; /= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal ; coagulation prothrombin time ( PT ) Partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) within normal limit unless patient already anticoagulated reason ( i.e. , atrial fibrillation , etc. ) . 11 . Patients Her2/neu positive tumor receive prior trastuzumab clinically appropriate . 1 . Patients preexist neuropathy &gt; /= grade 2 . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition CT2103 , gemcitabine agent use study . History typical paclitaxel docetaxelinduced Grade 12 hypersensitivity reaction permit . 5 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 6 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study . 7 . Previous history stem cell transplantation . 8 . History central nervous system metastasis . 9 . While strict exclusion base upon previous number therapy , patient experience grade 3 4 hematologic toxicity require use white blood count ( WBC ) growth factor support recent chemotherapy prior enrollment exclude . Exceptions would include patient received growth factor support mandate clinical study , and/or patient chemotherapy least 6 month .</criteria>
