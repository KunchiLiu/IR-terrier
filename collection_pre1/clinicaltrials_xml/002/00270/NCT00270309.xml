Study design This study use format randomise control trial . 200 new patient uncomplicated LUTS randomise either attend attend ( standard therapy ) self-management programme . The programme provide education , reassurance , prostate cancer risk , advice lifestyle modification ( e.g . fluid - type amount ) , concurrent medication re-scheduling behavioural change ( double-voiding , strategy dribble , bladder re-training ) . These strategy learn group discussion , problem solve goal setting . All men start study period watchful waiting ( monitor symptom ) follow total 1 year . At assessment ( baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month ) symptom severity use drug therapy control symptom compare two group . The difference one group attend self-management programme . Potential application result Self-management focus patient involvement health care involve day-to-day control symptom . If effective , self-management may provide long-term method manage LUTS without use drug therapy , thereby offer considerable health gain financial saving . The NHS Modernisation Agency wish develop role nurse specialist manage patient independently doctor . Nurse-led LUTS assessment clinic well establish , perhaps nurse manage patient self-management intervention may become part standard therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . OBJECTIVES To assess effectiveness self-management intervention men uncomplicated LUTS . 2 . STUDY DESIGN 2.1 This randomise control trial compare self-management standard therapy . These intervention propose optimise watchful waiting , provide alternative drug surgery symptom control . Participants 2.2 . Participating urological unit include Middlesex Hospital NHS Trust Whittington Hospital NHS Trust . 2.3 . 200 new patient uncomplicated LUTS ( I-PSS score 0-35 ) randomise either attend self-management programme attend self-management programme ( standard therapy - control group ) . There approximately 100 men group . Standard therapy , describe previously , involve watchful waiting , drug surgery , therapeutic choice depend weight severity bother , risk benefit . 2.4 . All new patient age 40 year diagnosis low urinary tract symptom secondary benign prostatic hyperplasia age relate bladder dysfunction eligible inclusion . 2.5 . The following exclusion criterion applies : - age 40 yr - low urinary tract symptom due urological malignancy whilst investigate urological malignancy e.g . prostate cancer - previous prostatic surgery within last 10 year pelvic radiotherapy - complication urinary obstruction ( acute chronic urinary retention - post micturition volume 300ml , bladder stone , renal failure , recurrent urinary tract infection haematuria ) - uncontrolled diabetes , dementia end stage cardiac respiratory failure - inability speak understand English language - severe symptom drug therapy surgical management indicate request patient - man previous 3 month medical therapy lower urinary tract symptom , include alpha-blocker , 5-alpha reductase inhibitor ( finasteride ) anti-cholinergics . The use alpha-blocker control hypertension permit , since men symptom still eligible medical treatment ( finasteride , anti-cholinergics ) surgery . 2.6 . Each patient fully inform regard study process possible us subsequent data collect . An information sheet head paper available consent form sign researcher patient . The patient participate study participate study conduct group future . 2.7 . All GP 's informed letter patient 's participation progress study . A copy standard letter leave patient ' note recruitment . 2.8 . Once recruit men randomise 2 group . Computer generate randomisation carry third party . Randomisation take place week zero man 12 month overall participation study . Patients recruit study coordinator . On recruitment enrolment form complete , copy leave patient note along consent form . 2.9 . Group 1 receive self-management Group 2 receive standard therapy . 2.10 . All men start study period watchful wait first assessment 2 month . During time men assign self-management attend 3 session , control group . 2.11 . Men Groups 1 &amp; 2 follow per protocol 2 , 6 , 12 month randomisation i.e . short , medium , long term . Intervention 2.12 . Men randomise Group 1 ( self-management ) addition standard follow , invite attend 3 small group ( 4-6 men ) session receive single telephone call ( self-management programme ) . 2.13 . The four key area within self-management programme : - Education - Reassurance - Lifestyle modification - Behavioural change 2.14 . The session facilitate local nurse practitioner ) . 2.15 . The session standardise run Facilitators Manual develop pilot The Royal College Surgeons The Centre Behavioural Social Sciences Medicine , UCL . 2.16 . Each session last approximately 2 hour mixture group learn brainstorm discussion , teaching , goal setting . All session support self-management booklet give session 1 . 2.17 . Session 1 ( first week ) : - Introduction programme review - Introduction concept self-management - Education/reassurance - prostate bladder health , prostate cancer , future symptom - Managing fluid intake - Caffeine abstinence - Alcohol advice 2.18 . Session 2 ( second week ) : - Adjusting medication affect LUTS e.g . diuretic ( relevant ) - Constipation advice - Strategies dribble - Double-voiding - Bladder re-training 2.19 . Third week telephone call - trouble shoot problem answer query 2.20 . Session 3 ( six week ) : - Booster session - Designed men share reason thing work others - Used discus reason example find difficult abstain caffeine goal set 2.21 . Each man Group 1 able contact Clinical Nurse Specialist time aside session case confusion query , telephone , e-mail letter . Intervention component 2.22 . Education - Men LUTS understand : - LUTS real symptom worthy medical care - Not LUTS require treatment drug and/or surgery ( give detail expect future symptomology ) - That patient important role play management symptom - Each patient ability follow self-management programme beneficial effect symptom - self-efficacy - The range treatment available men LUTS include treatment use others i.e . appropriateness treatment 2.23 . Reassurance - Men LUTS understand : - The symptom severity many men LUTS change time ( 85 % stable 1 year 65 % 5 year [ 17,18 ] ) - Some men may see spontaneous symptom improvement - The annual risk acute urinary retention 2 % [ 19 ] - LUTS often affect man 's current state mind , high level arousal worry detrimental effect - Their symptom due detectable prostate cancer - That risk prostate cancer age relate man symptom i.e . general male population age [ 20 ] 2.24 . Lifestyle modification include fluid , caffeine alcohol advice . Fluid advice • Introduce concept healthy fluid balance - Explain significance concentrate urine potential detrimental ( irritative ) effect - There good fluid habit men use regularly minimal effort - There specific change men may make base previously complete chart e.g . excessive intake water night - Excessive inadequate fluid intake always avoid - A total daily intake 1500-2000 ml advise ( minor adjustment make climate activity ) - Fluid space evenly throughout day rather large single amount - Fluid restriction symptom control time great inconvenience e.g . long car journey public place , appropriate , overall daily intake restrict significantly ( control irritative symptom ) - If nocturia bothersome , fluid restriction 2 hour retire bed effective Caffeine Advice • Explain caffeine detrimental effect symptom men LUTS especially irritative symptom - Explain caffeine find tea , coffee , chocolate , energy drink counter flu remedy - Explain completely avoid caffeine , symptom improvement may find - If caffeine use excessive stop overnight 2-3 day avoid headache stomach cramp etc - Caffeine avoidance achieve substitute drink de-caffeinated non-caffeinated e.g . de-caffeinated coffee soft drink - Nocturia exacerbate even caffeine use , prevent caffeine avoid 5 hour prior retire Alcohol advice • Explain alcohol detrimental effect symptom men LUTS especially irritative symptom • Explain completely avoid alcohol , symptom improvement may find , understand may possible avoid alcohol restriction alcohol time great inconvenience may appropriate - Explain quality life issue alcohol abstinence information guide - In men nocturia even alcohol use avoid - Explain consume alcohol often consume large quantity extra fluid symptom reduction may achieve substitute large volume alcoholic drink small volume alcoholic drink e.g . pint short Timing concurrent medication • Adjust time medication ( effect urinary symptom ) take improve LUTS time inconvenience e.g . meeting , long car journey public place • Substitute anti-hypertensive diuretic ( aid patient 's GP ) suitable alternative less urinary effect man LUTS Behavioural change • Men obvious 'bad habit ' advise e.g . go 'just case ' type man • Men LUTS advise double void • Men post micturition dribble advise urethral milk • Men LUTS 'irritative ' symptom offer formal bladder re-training programme . • Advice give men LUTS regard avoid constipation 2.25 . Men randomise self-management arm study also offer booster refresher session six-months , six month assessment . Outcomes 2.26 . The primary outcome treatment failure . In study treatment failure define : • The use drug therapy symptom control ( determine consultation clinician patient ) - Surgical intervention ( determined consultation clinician patient ) - Symptom deterioration 3 point [ 22 ] measure I-PSS - Acute urinary retention - Death 2.27 . Secondary outcome include 3 day frequency / volume chart , infection , health-seeking behaviour ( unscheduled clinic , A &amp; E GP visit ) . Secondary outcome also include Quality life / bother assessment use BPH Impact Index , [ 24 ] ( appendix 5 . ) , Short Form-36 - SF-36 ( appendix 7 . ) Illness Perception Questionnaire - IPQ ( appendix 8. ) . The clinician blind group patient assign , patient ask divulge group . It possible blind patient group group assign . Any instance unblinding declare . Follow assessment 2.28 . Men within study group see consultant specialist registrar ( i.e . continuity throughout study ) doctor brief study design blind group man assign . 2.29 . If man deteriorate significantly drug therapy ( alpha-blocker , finasteride anti-cholinergics ) offer ; standard urological practice . As men see one 2 different doctor , move conservative drug therapy consistent . 2.30 . The outcome consultation clinician patient record clinician standard form ( appendix 9 . ) give patient , copy leave note . 2.31 . At visit patient give follow complete : I-PSS , BPH Impact Index , SF-36 , Illness perception questionnaire 3-day frequency / volume chart , ask send data manager along outcome form complete consultant pre-paid envelope . 2.32 . The data manager blind group patient responsible collecting , loading , chase miss data . The data manager telephone patient within 48 hour out-patient follow complete assessment encourage completion study document . 2.33 . A follow rate 80 % achieve . 3 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 3.1 . The two group directly compare respect outcome measurement man 's 12 month study period . 3.2 . Analysis intention treat basis , i.e . - men always analyse group assign . 3.3 . Statistical analysis perform STATA Version 7 . An unpaired t-test use analyse continuous variable e.g . I-PSS , chi-squared exact test use categorical data . Logarithmic transformation use normalise continuous variable . 3.4 . Sample size - A minimum 84 men require group 90 % chance detect 3 point difference mean I-PSS score ( SD=6 ) 5 % level significance use unpaired t-test . We choose 3-point reduction I-PSS correspond detectable clinical difference symptom patient . 4 . DATA COLLECTION 4.1 . Each man part study programme 12 month . After time man discharge study programme . If still require service urology out-patients appointment , investigation treatment , arrange . 4.2 . If self-management see effective offer men Group 2 receive standard treatment . 4.3 . The information anonymised patient give unique identification number . 4.4 .
