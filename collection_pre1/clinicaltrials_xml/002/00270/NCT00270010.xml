	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness safety epoetin alfa versus placebo treatment anemia AIDS ( Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ) patient anemia result disease zidovudine ( AZT ) treatment . Epoetin alfa genetically engineer protein stimulates red blood cell production .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Epoetin Alfa AIDS ( Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ) Patients With Anemia Caused Both Their Disease AZT ( Zidovudine , Antiviral Drug ) Given Treatment Their Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate approximately 75 % 80 % patient AIDS experience anemia , cause AIDS therapy patient receive AIDS treatment ( example , AZT ) . Anemia condition patient normal level hemoglobin , substance red blood cell carry oxygen part body . People severe anemia may experience fatigue shortness breath activity . Therefore , condition negative influence person 's quality life . Epoetin alfa , use treat anemia , genetically engineer form natural hormone , erythropoietin , stimulates red blood cell production . This randomized , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether patient receive epoetin alfa placebo ) , placebo-controlled , parallel group study open-label follow-up period design evaluate safety effectiveness epoetin alfa treatment patient AIDS treat AZT . The study consist 3 period : screening period determine patient eligible study , double-blind period , open-label period . Eligible patient randomly assign one two group : group receive epoetin alfa 200 U/kg group receive match placebo . Patients treat study medication inject skin 3 time per week 12 week ( hematocrit reach 38 % 40 % ) . In open-label period , patient receive epoetin alfa inject skin 6 month . Effectiveness determine change hemoglobin hematocrit ( laboratory test use evaluate severity anemia ) , transfusion requirement , patient 's quality life assessment , physician 's global evaluation drug effect . Safety assessment include incidence severity adverse event study , change clinical laboratory test ( hematology , biochemistry , urinalysis ) , vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , physical examination finding . The study hypothesis AIDS patient receive AZT treat epoetin alfa lower incident anemia compare patient receive placebo . Double-blind : epoetin alfa ( 200 U/kg ) placebo give skin 3 time week 12 week hematocrit reach 38 % 40 % . Open-label : epoetin alfa 250 U/kg 3 time week 6 month ( weekly hematocrit reach 38 % 40 % ) . Dosage may adjust 300 U/kg .</detailed_description>
