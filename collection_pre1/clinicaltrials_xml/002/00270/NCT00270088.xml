	<brief_title>A Study Determine Whether Epoetin Alfa Can Reduce Need Blood Transfusions Patients During Period Time Around Major Orthopedic Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo major orthopedic surgery frequently require blood transfusion operation . These transfusion result adverse reaction , blood clot deep vein . Agents reduce need transfusion would improve overall safety surgery . In previous study epoetin alfa , patient generally experienced increase percentage red blood cell whole blood , decrease blood transfusion , decrease number surgery-related adverse reaction , good tolerance drug . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multicenter study . The study evaluate safety epoetin alfa determine whether epoetin alfa reduce need blood transfusion patient expect require least 2 unit blood period time around major orthopedic hip knee surgery . Before start study , patient screen eligibility test perform determine amount hemoglobin present patient 's blood . Based result , patient divide 3 group : patient hemoglobin &lt; =10 grams/deciliter ( g/dL ) , patient hemoglobin &gt; 10 &lt; =13 g/dL , patient hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL . Within group , patient randomly assign receive 1 3 treatment : epoetin alfa 300 units/kilogram ( U/kg ) , epoetin alfa 100 U/kg , placebo , injection beneath skin , begin 10 day schedule surgery end 4 day surgery . Additionally , 10 day surgery 4 day surgery patient receive 150 milligram iron supplement daily mouth , day surgery ( follow surgery ) 6 day surgery , patient give Coumadin 5 milligram daily ( drug prevent blood clot deep vein ) . Safety evaluation include laboratory test , physical examination , vital sign , record adverse event perform throughout study patient discharge hospital . In addition , six week surgery , laboratory test perform , vital sign measure , adverse event record . Ultrasound perform start study Day 5 surgery determine blood clot deep vein . Effectiveness determine reduction need transfusion period time around surgery . The study hypothesis patient treat epoetin alfa require few transfusion period time around surgery patient treat placebo . Epoetin alfa 300 units/kilogram ( U/kg ) , epoetin alfa 100 U/kg , placebo , injection beneath skin begin 10 day schedule surgery end 4 day surgery .</detailed_description>
