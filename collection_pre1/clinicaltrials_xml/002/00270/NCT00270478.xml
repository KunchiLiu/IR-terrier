	<brief_summary>This study examine use hydroxyurea erythropoietin treat sickle cell disease patient also kidney disease pulmonary hypertension ( high blood pressure lung ) . Hydroxyurea increase production fetal hemoglobin red blood cell patient sickle cell disease , reduce amount sickle cell cause pain complication require hospitalization . However , hydroxyurea treatment limitation : patient sickle cell disease develop kidney disease may able get full benefit medicine , hydroxyurea alone may able treat life-threatening complication pulmonary hypertension stroke . This study determine two dose schedule hydroxyurea erythropoietin effective treat patient sickle cell disease also kidney disease pulmonary hypertension , examine whether two drug low blood pressure lung . Patients 18 year age old sickle cell anemia kidney disease pulmonary hypertension , , may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test , 6-minute walk test ( test see far subject walk 6 minute ) , echocardiogram ( ultrasound heart measure blood pressure lung ) . Participants undergo follow test procedure : Stabilization Phase : Patients take 2 hydroxyurea tablet day fetal hemoglobin level stabilize , usually 2 4 month . They blood test every 2 week monitor hemoglobin fetal hemoglobin level . At time period , undergo test measure kidney function , inject iodine-containing dye wear small pump 1 day injects small amount dye skin 24 hour . They come clinic 2 3 blood test collect 4 hour . Sequence I ( Standard ) : When fetal hemoglobin level stable 2 month , patient repeat echocardiogram 6-minute walk test . Erythropoietin add hydroxyurea regimen . It give 3 day week , injection skin , along iron supplement . Patients blood test blood pressure measurement every week every week . Patients pulmonary hypertension another echocardiogram 6-minute walk test hemoglobin level stable . Sequence II ( Cycled ) : When hemoglobin level stabilize hydroxyurea day erythropoietin 3 time week , hydroxyurea adjust amount take 7 day `` cycle '' 4 day , erythropoietin cycle 3 day , dose increase twice , every 3 4 week . Blood pressure hemoglobin monitor twice month . Patients pulmonary hypertension another echocardiogram 6-minute walk test hemoglobin level stable . Patients develop complication take drug treatment regimen adjust need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxyurea Erythropoietin Treat Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) genetic disease afflict eighty thousand Americans , 4 5,000 newborn per year US , 100 thousand child adult world-wide . This disease arise single amino acid mutation beta globin chain hemoglobin , result abnormal polymerization deoxygenate hemoglobin . The deceptively simple biologic origin SCD belie debilitate chronic multi-faceted clinical syndrome associate ; SCD characterize lifelong hemolysis , chronic anemia , recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crisis ( VOC ) , hepatic , renal , musculo-skeletal , central nervous system complication , shorten life-expectancy . Our group find 33 % incidence pulmonary hypertension adult patient SCD screen follow prospectively ; two-year follow-up , pulmonary hypertension associate 10-fold increased mortality rate . Hydroxyurea emerge useful therapy sickle cell disease . It cell-cycle specific agent block DNA synthesis inhibit ribonucleotide reductase , enzyme convert ribonucleotides deoxyribonucleotides . Hydroxyurea show induce production fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) patient sickle cell anemia , associate diminished morbidity , likely , mortality patient . Any HbF good SCD , although estimate level 20 percent HbF require substantially reduce sickling propensity red cell modulate disease severity . The majority patient SCD respond hydroxyurea two-fold increase HbF level ; patient percent HbF exceed 10 15 percent , uniformly distribute cell , i.e . hetero-cellular rather pan-cellular distribution . The mechanism hydroxyurea augments fetal Hgb incompletely characterize . An additional benefit hydroxyurea may effect nitric oxide ( NO ) system . Recently , member group find hydroxyurea therapy associate intravascular intra-erythrocytic generation NO , NO increase HbF expression via guanylyl cyclase/cGMP dependent pathway . We treat 30 patient chronically hydroxyurea determine hematological change Iongitudinally , establish maximal HbF raise effect hydroxyurea patient . We find level HbF induce hydroxyurea alone insufficient , insufficiently widely distribute , ameliorate life-threatening complication pulmonary HTN on-going hemolysis patient sickle cell disease . Earlier study suggest addition erythropoietin ( Erythropoietin ) therapy chronic hydroxyurea therapy may induce fetal hemoglobin high , widely distribute , level . We plan test patient sickle cell disease chronic kidney disease , , presumably , leaf depress Erythropoietin reserve inability tolerate standard dos F-inducing therapy hydroxyurea , patient pulmonary HTN , carry ominous prognosis SCD . A secondary endpoint study evaluate hydroxyurea plus Erythropoietin therapy improve cardiovascular aerobic capacity general , particular minimize symptom morbidity patient chronic kidney disease pulmonary HTN .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients homozygous SCD sickling disorder ( e.g. , B ( 0 ) Thalassemia/Sickle ) 18 year age great eligible treatment . Patients currently follow NIH study Howard University stable dos hydroxyurea also eligible . A total 60 patient recruit study , recognition earlier study failuretocomplete rate approach 50 % . Patients must document hemoglobin Sonly Sbeta ( 0 ) thalassemia . Patients must relatively well preserve hepatic function ( le 3 X upper limit normal ALT ) . Patients must able provide inform consent . Patients must : eGFR 15 60 ml/min per 1.73 ( 2 ) BSA , eGFR 61 90 ml/min per 1.73 ( 2 ) BSA great 16.9 mg albumin/g creatinine ( great 0.017 ratio g/g ) , and/or transthoracic echocardiographic measurement pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) , estimate tricuspid regurgitant velocity , great 2.5 sec ( 1 ) monthly baseline time two . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients doubly heterozygous hemoglobinS fully partially express hemoglobinA nonS betatype globin chain , hemoglobin Aonly ( nonsickle cell ) . Patients chronic transfusion program , define regular transfusion every 28 week . Patients pregnant breastfeeding . Patients history document cerebrovascular accident venous thrombosis within one year study entry . Patients active proliferative retinopathy within 1 year study entry Patients eGFR less equal 14 ml/min per 1.73 M ( 2 ) BSA . Patients total Hgb entry 10.5 g/dl great Patients know allergy Albumin cellderived product Patients uncontrolled hypertension , define systolic blood pressure great 170 mmHg diastolic blood pressure great 110 mm Hg sustain unresponsive 1 week conventional antihypertensive therapy .</criteria>
