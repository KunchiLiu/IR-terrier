	<brief_summary>Background : - Heritable disorder connective tissue genetic condition affect skin part body . They relate mutation gene responsible building tissue . The symptom differ among disorder . Researchers want study gene may responsible different disorder . They perform long-term ( 10 year ) study study require single visit . These study look disorder affect body gene may cause condition . Objectives : - To perform one-time long-term study people heritable disorder connective tissue . Eligibility : - Individuals least 2 year age may heritable disorder connective tissue . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , blood sample . - Participants one two part study . The longitudinal arm require long-term study 10 year . The mutational analysis arm involve single visit . - Longitudinal arm participant must least 12 year age . They study visit regular interval 10 year . The test give visit may include follow : - Blood , saliva , urine , skin sample - Heart lung function test - Magnetic resonance imaging scan neck , chest , spine , abdomen - Other image study x-ray , bone density scan , ultrasounds - Questionnaires sleep , pain , quality life - Photographs affect area . - Mutational analysis arm participant single study visit . They provide blood saliva sample . They provide tissue skin biopsy . They also let researcher take photo affect body part . They complete questionnaire sleep , pain , quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heritable disorder connective tissue heterogenous group genetic condition cause defect extracellular matrix element collagen , elastin , mucopolysaccharide related biomolecules . The genetic cause many connective tissue disorder elucidate , others yet discover define . While clinical diagnostic criterion establish several connective tissue syndrome , many share feature overlap know description connective tissue disorder . Therefore , characterization phenotype/genotype correlation need adequately diagnose find treatment yet-to-be genotyped disorder . An aim work examination cardiovascular , musculoskeletal neurological complication heritable connective tissue disorder ( HDCT ) natural history complication . Through mutational analysis gene know cause HDCT , well identification new gene , ass relationship specific mutation associated disease phenotype . Through analysis tissue specimen obtain patient HDCT , identify biochemical pathway lead connective tissue fragility . We continue assess severity , prevalence , pattern pain related psychological quality life dimension HDCT . The result understanding genotype/phenotype correlation biochemical pathway enhance understand connective tissue biology . This knowledge potential lead new treatment patient HDCT , also pathological condition associate weakness connective tissue age .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals family member offer enrollment establish suspected diagnosis Marfan , Stickler , EhlersDanlos syndrome , Overlap connective tissue disorder . Determination eligibility make review prior record . In case , screen evaluation establish diagnosis may perform subject may exclude participation diagnosis rule . Cytogenetic analysis may necessary rule chromosomal abnormality overlap feature HDCT . Clinical inclusion criterion require : personal family history one following feature pattern suggestive heritable connective tissue disorder : Marfanoid body habitus , aortic dilatation and/or dissection , ectopia lentis , detach retina , vitreous degeneration and/or early onset high myopia , posterior cleft palate , joint laxity and/or dislocation , premature osteoarthritis , skin fragility , stria , easy bruise and/or hyperextensibile skin , pectus excavatum carinatum , scoliosis , spondylolisthesis and/or dural ectasia , Chiari I Malformation , high frequency sensorineural hearing loss , fibromuscular dysplasia artery , aneurysm . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The exclusion criterion inability provide inform consent , absence guardian authorize provide inform consent case minor subject . There exclusion base upon age , gender , ethnicity , socioeconomic status , factor except ability provide inform consent . Pregnant nursing woman may limit participation aspect study ( e.g . ionize radiation exposure MRI ) time pregnant nursing .</criteria>
