	<brief_summary>Anti-HIV drug regimen dramatically improve rate prevention mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HIV develop country . However , little known effectiveness regimen develop country , Botswana . This study determine whether Trizivir ( TZV ) , single pill contain abacavir sulfate , lamivudine , zidovudine ( ABC/3TC/ZDV ) , lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) lamivudine/zidovudine ( 3TC/ZDV ) effective reduce HIV-1 viral load prevent MTCT among HIV infect pregnant woman Botswana .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While perinatal HIV infection become rare developed country use highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , remain serious problem develop country . Botswana population approximately 1.7 million ; prevalence HIV Botswana 37.4 % . In developed world , HAART revolutionize prevention MTCT among nonbreastfed infant . This trial compare effectiveness protease inhibitor ( PI ) -based regimen versus triple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) -based regimen prevent MTCT HIV . This study last 24 month mother child . Participants stratify base CD4 count screen . Women CD4 count 200 cells/mm3 one two treatment group randomly assign receive either TZV twice daily LPV/RTV 3TC/ZDV twice daily . Once labor , treatment group participant continue take assigned HAART regimen also give additional ZDV . Women CD4 count less 200 cells/mm3 receive nevirapine ( NVP ) daily first 14 day , twice daily , 3TC/ZDV twice daily ; woman observational group . Shortly birth , infant receive single-dose NVP . A 1-month supply ZDV provide mother administer daily child . Mothers stop HAART 6 month postpartum stop breastfeeding , whichever occur early . A clinical evaluation , blood collection , HIV prevention counsel occur maternal visit . An obstetrical exam physical exam occur select visit . Women provide least four sample breast milk first 5 month postpartum . For infant , clinical evaluation occur every visit , physical exam blood collection occur select visit .</detailed_description>
