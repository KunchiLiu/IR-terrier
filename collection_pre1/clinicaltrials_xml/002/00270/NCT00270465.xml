	<brief_summary>Study Design : This Phase I , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded study examine safety , tolerability immune response prime-boost vaccination regimen treatment HIV infection . The vaccination schedule consist three injection multiclade HIV plasmid DNA vaccine follow one injection multiclade recombinant adenoviral vector vaccine ( rAd ) , HIV-infected adult . The hypothesis vaccination regimen safe elicit immune response HIV-infected subject . The primary objective relate evaluate safety tolerability vaccination regimen assess effect vaccination humoral cellular immune response vaccine-specific HIV antigen . Product Description : VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP compose 6 close , circular DNA plasmid 16.67 % ( weight ) vaccine . Each 6 plasmid vaccine express single gene product . Plasmids VRC 4401 , VRC 4409 VRC 4404 design express clade B HIV-1 Gag , Pol Nef , respectively . VRC 5736 , VRC 5737 , VRC 5738 design express HIV-1 Env glycoprotein clade A , clade B , clade C , respectively . Each DNA vaccination 1 mL vaccine administer intramuscularly ( IM ) use Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System . Phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) use placebo DNA vaccine . VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP ( rAd ) recombinant product compose 4 adenoviral vector ( Ad ) ( 3:1:1:1 ratio ) encode HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein clade B HIV-1 Env glycoproteins clades A , B , C , respectively . Injections 10 ( 10 ) PU administer IM needle syringe . The final formulation buffer ( FFB ) use placebo rAd vaccine . Subjects : HIV-infected adult volunteer ( 18-50 year old ) stable highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) therapy CD4+ cell count great 350 cells/mm3 viral load ( VL ) less 400 copies/mL least six month viral load le 50 copies/mL within 4 week prior enrollment . Study Plan : Fifteen volunteer enrol randomized 2:1 ratio vaccine : control ( 10 DNA prime rAd boost:5 PBS FFB placebo ) . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review study every 6 month . Subjects evaluate safety immunogenicity 48 week , 24 week target date booster vaccination . Study Duration : Subjects follow 48 week enrollment study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study determine safety side effect two experimental HIV vaccine see vaccination enhance pre-existing HIV-specific immune response HIV-infected individual anti-retroviral therapy . The vaccine VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP ( call `` DNA vaccine '' ) VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP ( call `` rAd vaccine '' ) . The DNA vaccine cod four HIV protein . The rAd vaccine make use adenovirus ( common virus cause upper respiratory infection , common cold ) modify contain DNA cod three HIV protein . These vaccine give `` prime-boost '' schedule cause HIV adenoviral infection . HIV-infected people 18 50 year old stable treatment plan HIV highly active antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug , CD4+ T cell count great 350 , low viral load may eligible 48-week study . Participants receive injection ( shot ) DNA vaccine placebo ( solution contain vaccine , medicine , drug ) day enter study study week 4 8 . They receive booster injection rAd vaccine placebo week 24 . The DNA vaccine give needle-less injection device call `` Biojector 2000 ( Registered Trademark ) '' rAd vaccine give use needle syringe . All shot give upper arm muscle , alternate right left arm injection . Patients fill diary card home 5 day vaccination , record temperature symptom . The card turn clinic first visit 5 day complete . Patients must call study nurse 1 2 day four injection 7 8 day first three injection . Patients 12 clinic visit course study . At visit , check health change problem , ask feeling take medication treatment , include over-the-counter medicine , herbal supplement , etc . Blood sample draw every visit urine sample collect visit . At week 28 ( 4 week fourth injection ) , patient undergo apheresis , procedure collect large number white blood cell . The cell test laboratory see immune system respond study vaccine . For procedure , blood collect needle arm vein spin machine separate white blood cell rest blood ( red cell , plasma platelet ) . The white cell remove rest blood return patient 's body needle . Patients want undergo apheresis 80 mL ( 1/3 cup ) blood drawn needle collect blood collection tube .</detailed_description>
