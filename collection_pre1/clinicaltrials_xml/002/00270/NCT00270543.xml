	<brief_title>An Effective Well-Tolerated Regimen Docetaxel Plus High-Dose 5-Fluorouracil Leucovorin ( HDFL ) Treat Inoperable Advanced Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The regimen consist docetaxel , 50 mg/m2 , 5-FU , 2400 mg/m2 , leucovorin , 240 mg/m2 day 1 15 . Docetaxel give 1-hour intravenous infusion 5-FU/leucovorin 24-hour intravenous infusion . The treatment cycle repeat every 4 week . Dexamethasone give docetaxel infusion prevent hypersensitivity fluid retention . Tumor response evaluate every 2 cycle . For patient inoperable locally advanced disease entry , achieve clinical complete ( CR ) partial ( PR ) response evaluate feasibility curative surgical resection.If pathological CR document , least 2 cycle chemotherapy give surgery . If microscopic residual tumor note curative surgery , protocol treatment continue disease progress intolerable toxicity develop . For patient metastatic disease entry , achieve CR receive least 2 cycle chemotherapy documentation CR . Patients PR continue protocol treatment disease progress intolerable toxicity develop . Patients stable disease continue protocol treatment minor tumor response improvement general condition ; patient stop protocol treatment change salvage therapy clinical benefit observe . Patients progressive disease stop protocol treatment change salvage therapy . The primary endpoint phase II trial objective tumor response rate . The secondary endpoint include treatment-related toxicity , clinical benefit response define change performance status body weight , change quality life , progression free survival overall survival . Simon 's optimal two-stage design use determine patient number.If 5 objective response document first 19 patient , study go second stage enroll total 54 eligible patient . The P0 , P1 , 20 % , 40 % , 0.05 , 0.1 , respectively . Assuming dropout rate 10 % , 21 patient accrue first stage 39 second stage . Estimated time patient accrual 3 year .</detailed_description>
