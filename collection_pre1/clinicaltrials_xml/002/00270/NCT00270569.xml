	<brief_title>An Effective Compliance Regimen Paclitaxel Plus Cisplatin Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer one leading cause cancer death woman Taiwan . We recently demonstrate combination paclitaxel cisplatin , conventional dos , highly effective treatment breast cancer . However , acute cumulative toxicity paclitaxel troublesome significant portion patient . Several line evidence suggest weekly paclitaxel , much low dose range 40 50 mg/m2 per week , may effective conventional dos paclitaxel ( 80 90 mg/m2 per week ) patient metastatic ovarian lung cancer . The low-dose regimen paclitaxel may significantly improve compliance patient . This open-label phase II trial design test hypothesis . The eligibility criterion include ( 1 ) woman metastatic breast cancer ; ( 2 ) measurable disease ; ( 3 ) acceptable organ function reserve . The ineligibility criterion include ( 1 ) brain leptomeningeal metastasis ; ( 2 ) previous chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer . The study consist two stage . All eligible patient receive stage I ( low-dose ) regimen : paclitaxel , 50 mg/m2 1-hour iv infusion day 1 , 8 15 , cisplatin , 40 mg/m2 24-hour iv infusion day 1 8 . The treatment cycle repeat every 4 week . The first tumor response assessment do 2 cycle protocol treatment . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive least 2 cycle low-dose regimen documentation CR . Patients partial response ( PR ) patient stable disease ( SD ) minor tumor response improvement general condition continue receive low-dose regimen . Patients SD evident clinical benefit patient progressive disease ( PD ) shift stage II ( conventional-dose ) regimen : paclitaxel , 80 mg/m2 1-hour intravenous infusion day 1 , 8 15 , cisplatin , 40 mg/m2 24-hour intravenous infusion day 1 8 , every 4 week . Tumor assessment evaluate every 2 cycle protocol treatment . For patient continue low-dose regimen , CR receive least 2 cycle protocol treatment . Patients maximal response PR SD may either continue low-dose regimen PD prohibitive toxicity develop change conventional-dose regimen , discretion attend physician . Patients PD change conventional-dose regimen . For patient shift conventional-dose regimen , CR receive least 2 cycle protocol treatment . Patients PR continue protocol treatment disease progress prohibitive toxicity develops . Patients SD may continue protocol treatment change salvage therapy . Patients PD stop protocol treatment change salvage therapy . The primary endpoint phase II trial objective response rate stage I ( low-dose ) regimen . The secondary endpoint include treatment-related toxicity , change quality life , progression free survival overall survival . Simon 's optimal two-stage design use determine patient number . If 4 objective response ( CR+PR ) document first 13 patient , study go second stage enroll total 43 patient . The P0 , P1 , 20 % , 40 % , 0.05 , 0.2 , respectively . Assuming dropout rate 10 % , 15 patient accrue first stage 33 second stage . Estimated time patient accrual 3 year .</detailed_description>
