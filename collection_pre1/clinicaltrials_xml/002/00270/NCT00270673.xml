	<detailed_description>Tissue hypoxia define state tissue oxygen demand meet tissue oxygen delivery ( DO2 ) . The presence persistence tissue hypoxia relate development organ system failure subsequent death . However , definite clinical indicator tissue hypoxia lacking . In experimental condition , mismatch oxygen delivery oxygen demand , result either progressive decrease component oxygen delivery ( hemoglobin level , arterial oxygen saturation cardiac output ) increase oxygen demand , lead increase blood lactate level . However , lactate normal end product metabolism , process related tissue hypoxia also link increase blood lactate level . In clinical condition increase blood lactate level failure normalize blood lactate level treatment associate increased morbidity mortality . Even hemodynamically stable patient hyperlactatemia , condition refer compensated shock occult hypoperfusion , lactate level relate morbidity mortality . In retrospective pilot study , perform general ICU Erasmus MC ( n= 931 ) , find 40 % mortality patient blood lactate level 3 mmol/l high early hour ICU admission . Blow al . implement treatment protocol increase oxygen delivery , guide blood lactate level , hemodynamically stable trauma patient occult hypoperfusion . Failure correct hyperlactatemia lactate-directed therapy correlate increased mortality . Rossi et al . study lactate-directed therapy child undergo congenital heart surgery . However , show reduction morbidity mortality , use historical control group . Only one randomize control trial perform evaluate lactate-directed therapy . This study Polonen et al . show decrease morbidity length stay post-cardiac surgery patient use lactate &lt; 2mmol/l ( mixed venous oxygen saturation [ SvO2 ] &gt; 70 % ) goal therapy . Thus , relevant body clinical evidence yet support routine monitoring blood lactate level lactate-directed therapy critically ill patient . As investigator even pose strong argument increase blood lactate level relate presence tissue hypoxia critically ill patient , clinician use increase blood lactate level guide therapy whereas others hardly measure lactate level . The limited evidence efficacy variable clinical use blood lactate monitoring different hospital thus warrant study clinical efficacy blood lactate monitoring blood lactate-directed therapy ICU . In general monitor influence outcome without associate treatment protocol guide treatment . We therefore study clinical efficacy repeat blood lactate measurement combination predefined treatment protocol ( aim resolve tissue hypoxia ) first hour intensive care treatment . This pragmatic approach also early timing intervention support study Rivers et al. , optimize balance oxygen delivery demand early treatment patient severe sepsis septic shock result 16 % absolute mortality reduction . The pre-defined treatment protocol consist component 1 ) reduce oxygen demand , 2 ) increase oxygen delivery 3 ) recruit microcirculation . 1 . Reduction metabolic oxygen demand successfully accomplish prevent hyperthermia , adequate analgesia sedation , mechanical ventilation . 2 . Increasing oxygen delivery achieve increase component oxygen transport ( arterial oxygen saturation , cardiac output hemoglobin level ) . However , oxygen deliver capability store red blood cell debate adverse effect red blood cell transfusion report . Best evidence suggest restrictive transfusion policy ICU ( transfusion threshold 4.34 mmol/l ) exception severe ischemic cardiac disease . 3 . Administration ( intravascular volume resuscitation ) nitroglycerin , reverse microcirculatory shutdown shunt septic shock patient . In severe heart failure cardiogenic shock , microcirculatory alteration also frequently encounter vasodilation may reverse condition . Although component treatment protocol innovative ( also available standard therapy group ) , guide treatment serial measurement blood lactate level . Intensive care extensively impact health care resource . Lactate-directed therapy aim prevention multiple organ failure ( MOF ) subsequent death . Patients MOF account disproportionately high part ICU budget . Moreover , general cost per ICU day high non-survivors survivor . Reduction use ICU health care resource lactate-directed therapy could thus result important economical benefit . In hospital , serial lactate measurement routinely use intensive care unit . In retrospective pilot study find 2004 Erasmus MC intensive care unit perform average 12 lactate measurement per patient per admission . This result total 28715 measurement estimate external budget cost € 336.000 . If lactate-directed therapy appear equally less effective standard therapy , blood lactate measurement ICU may indicate resource could thus save . Therefore , positive negative outcome randomize control trial would clinically economically relevant . The main research question study , patient increase initial blood lactate level admission ICU : 1. early lactate-directed therapy reduce mortality ? ( primary endpoint ) 2. early lactate-directed therapy reduce morbidity ? 3. early lactate-directed therapy reduce consumption health care resource ?</detailed_description>
