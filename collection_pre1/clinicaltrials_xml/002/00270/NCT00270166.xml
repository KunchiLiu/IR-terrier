	<brief_title>The Effect Epoetin Alfa Anemia Patients With Selected Cancers Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer patient often experience anemia due disease , chemotherapy , . Quality life also affect , part fatigue associate anemia . Previous study epoetin alfa suggest achieve high hemoglobin level may improve quality life help patient live longer . This study 12-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled multicenter study compare ability epoetin alfa placebo reduce prevent anemia transfusion , investigate quality-of-life benefit associate use epoetin alfa patient receive chemotherapy select cancer . During double-blind period two group patient : one group receive epoetin injection skin 3 time per week ( start 150 unit per kilogram , adjust need maximum 300 unit per kilogram ) group receive injection skin placebo match appearance volume . If hemoglobin rise 140 gram per liter ( woman ) 150 gram per liter ( men ) , dose adjust keep hemoglobin within target range . A 12-week open-label extension study available patient complete 12-week comparison period . The primary measure effectiveness determine proportion patient transfusion first month . Additional measure effectiveness include : proportion responder , change hemoglobin unrelated transfusion , cumulative transfusion rate proportion patient transfuse double-blind phase ( exclude first month ) , well mean change study period score energy , activity overall quality life . The result analyze separately non-platinum-containing chemotherapy different tumor type . Safety evaluation include assessment incidence severity adverse event , clinical laboratory test , vital sign measurement , physical examination . The hypothesis study epoetin alfa superior placebo improve anemia , reduce number transfusion , improve quality life . Epoetin alfa 150 unit ( U ) per kilogram ( kg ) placebo , inject skin 3 time weekly 4 week ; either continue 150 U/kg adjust 300 U/kg accord hemoglobin level remain 8 week . Open-label ( 12 week ) : dose maintain target hemoglobin range .</detailed_description>
