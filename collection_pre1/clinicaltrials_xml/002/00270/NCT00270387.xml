	<brief_title>A Study Short-Term Outcomes Economic Impact For Patients With Worsening Congestive Heart Failure When Natrecor ( Nesiritide ) Added Standard-Care Therapy , Compared Administration Placebo With Standard-Care Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) public health epidemic U.S. , affect almost 5 million Americans . It associate 5-year mortality rate 50 % ( accord American Heart Association , 1999 ) currently costly cardiovascular disease U.S. ( accord Rich MW et al 1999 O'Connell JB 2000 ) . In 1999 , total estimate direct indirect cost associate treatment CHF approach $ 56 billion ( accord O'Connell JB 2000 ) . Advanced CHF account 1 million hospital admission annually U.S.and large portion total expense third-party payer , due high cost acute inpatient care relate Emergency Department visit . Emergency Departments last line defense hospital admission CHF . Operational liability issue pertain typical Emergency Department lead hospital admission CHF patient . Yet , problem bed availability may lead delayed transfer patient Emergency Department inpatient unit , delay important treatment . To address , many Emergency Departments develop extended-stay policy observation continue care patient discharge Emergency Department within hour arrival . With extended stay ( &lt; 24 hour ) evaluation treatment Emergency Department , hospital admission CHF may significantly reduce adequately rule coronary ischemia aggressively treat precipitate factor decompensation . This allow physician well assess appropriateness admission patient ( accord Graff LG 1993 ) . Initiation safe effective acute therapy addition usual standard care may make possible reduce hospital admission severity patient 's condition time admission . Natrecor® approve use treatment acutely decompensated CHF patient dyspnea rest minimal activity . It recombinant form ( produce genetic engineering ) naturally occur human B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP , also know brain natriuretic peptide ) produce primarily ventricular myocardium ( accord Hosoda K et al 1991 ) . Natrecor® well tolerate controlled clinical trial involve 1000 patient CHF . The data previous study suggest dos Natrecor® may potent agent treatment acute CHF unique combination desirable effect flow blood throughout body ; hormone secrete nervous system ; support copious salt output renal system provide currently available therapy ( accord LeJemtel TH et al 1998 ) . Although Natrecor® study set Emergency Department , administer fixed-dose infusion without invasive monitoring 500 patient . Furthermore , Natrecor® associate increase cardiac ectopy arrhythmia placebo-controlled active-controlled trial ( accord Burger AJ et al 1999 Mills RM et al 1999 ) . This multicenter , randomize , double-blinded pilot study compare clinical effect , safety profile , economic impact standard therapy plus Natrecor® standard therapy plus placebo treatment acutely decompensated CHF Emergency Department/Observation Unit set . Study drug ( Natrecor® placebo ) administer bolus 2 mcg/kg approximately 60 second , immediately follow fixed-rate infusion 0.01 mcg/kg/min least 12 hour . Subjects continue receive study drug remain Emergency Department/Observation Unit beyond 12 hour , 24 hour , vital sign measure 18 hour , 24 hour , immediately discontinuation study drug , 30 minute , 1 hour , 2 hour discontinuation study drug . Also , global clinical dyspnea ( difficulty breathe shortness breath ) evaluation , visual monitoring scale dyspnea , complete time termination study drug Emergency Department/Observation Unit , admission hospital . The health-economic analysis focus resource utilization cost care initial treatment Emergency Department/Observation Unit inpatient facility ( admit ) , well subsequent treatment Emergency Department acute inpatient facility within 30-day study period . The study hypothesis efficacy safety profile Natrecor® may conducive early administration acute treatment heart failure Emergency Department addition standard care , may make possible reduce hospital admission severity patient 's condition time admission . Natrecor® 1.5 mg injection make final concentration 0.3 mg/mL 5 % dextrose water , placebo . Dispensed intravenous bolus 2 mcg/kg approximately 60 second , immediately follow fixed-rate infusion 0.01 mcg/kg/min least 12 hour .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients history consistent congestive heart failure ( either chronic new onset ) fluid overload elevate cardiac filling pressure clinical diagnosis need observation intravenous therapy least 12 hour , primarily treatment acutely worsen heart failure dyspnea ( difficulty breathe shortness breath ) rest , supine , immediately upon minimal exertion , evidence heart failure rather pulmonary disease primary cause dyspnea jugular venous distension , abdominal discomfort ( decrease appetite nausea ) weight gain least 5 pound previous month chest xray finding indicative heart failure , rale ( sound associate fluid lung cavity ) hear physical examination . Patients clinical status acutely unstable invasive monitoring mechanical ventilation require admitted Emergency Department/Observation Unit primarily diagnostic evaluation ( rule myocardial infarction diagnose irregular heart beat ) systolic blood pressure consistently less 90 mm Hg cardiogenic shock ( sudden decrease blood pressure result decrease perfusion body tissue organ ) , volume depletion , clinical condition would contraindicate administration intravenous diuretic , ACE inhibitor , intravenous agent potent vasodilating property circumstance recognize baseline evaluation would definitely prohibit discharge home Emergency Department/Observation Unit less 24 hour .</criteria>
