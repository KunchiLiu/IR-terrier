	<brief_title>Epoetin Alfa Anemia Patients With Cancer Receiving Non-platinum Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer patient often experience anemia due disease , chemotherapy , . Quality life also affect , due part fatigue associate anemia . Previous study epoetin alfa suggest achieve high hemoglobin level may improve quality life help patient live longer . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study assess effect treatment epoetin alfa reduce prevent anemia transfusion patient receive non-platinum chemotherapy non-myeloid cancer . The study also aim determine whether change erythropoietin hemoglobin level 2 week , serum ferritin ( iron ) level 2 week change hemoglobin develop red blood cell either 2 4 week predict responsiveness epoetin alfa . There 2 treatment group : one group receive subcutaneous epoetin alfa injection 3 time per week ( start 150 unit per kilogram , adjust need maximum 300 unit per kilogram ) group receive equal volume match subcutaneous placebo . Treatment continue 12 24 week ( 3 6 chemotherapy cycle ) , plus 4 week post-chemotherapy . Patients study observed year study end survival data . The primary measure effectiveness determine number patient transfuse , depend primary tumor type ( solid blood ) level hemoglobin ( 10.5 gram per deciliter ) . Additional measure effectiveness include change hemoglobin , hematocrit , develop red blood cell start study study completion , change quality life . Safety evaluation ( incidence severity adverse event , laboratory test , vital sign physical examination ) perform throughout study . The hypothesis study epoetin alfa superior placebo reduce need transfusion improve anemia quality life . 150 unit per kilogram epoetin alfa ( placebo ) 3 time weekly subcutaneously 4 week , continue dose 300 unit per kilogram , depend develop red blood cell count and/or hemoglobin . Study duration 12 24 week ( 3 6 cycle ) plus 4 week post-chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
