	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Epoetin Alfa Facilitating Self-donation Blood Before Surgery Patients Who Are Undergoing Orthopedic Surgery Who Have Low Hematocrit Levels ( Percent Red Blood Cells Whole Blood )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo major orthopedic surgery frequently require blood transfusion operation . A large percentage patient able pre-deposit blood transfusion . Additionally , patient anemic , determine low hematocrit level , amount blood collect patient may sufficient satisfy amount require transfusion . Further , complication transmission infectious disease possible transfusion donor . Agents facilitate self-donation reduce need transfusion others may improve overall safety surgery . Epoetin alfa genetically engineer form natural hormone , erythropoietin , use treat anemia stimulate red blood cell production . This randomized , open-label , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multicenter study evaluate safety epoetin alfa determine whether epoetin alfa facilitate self-deposit blood patient low hematocrit level , undergo orthopedic total hip replacement surgery , expect require 3 4 unit blood surgery . The study consist 5-day screening period patient ' study eligibility determine , 21-day treatment blood collection period , period around time surgery ( include record patient 's blood status surgery , well record blood loss number self-donated and/or donor-donated unit blood use surgery ) . Eligible patient randomly assign one four treatment group : epoetin alfa 300 units/kilogram ( U/kg ) , epoetin alfa 600 U/kg , placebo match volume epoetin alfa 300 U/kg , placebo match volume epoetin alfa 600 U/kg , injection vein . Twice many patient receive epoetin alfa receive placebo . Patients physician know group individual patient assign . Study medication administer patient every 3 4 day , total 6 dos 21-day treatment period end surgery . Additionally , patient receive 300 milligram iron supplement daily mouth combination iron supplement mouth inject vein 21-day treatment period . The dose iron supplement need administration iron supplement vein determine base blood test measure iron content blood collection blood self-donation . Patients borderline iron-deficient screening may give iron injected vein 3 4 day start study . Thereafter , patient randomly assign receive either daily oral iron supplement daily oral iron supplement plus iron injected vein collection unit blood . On Day 1 , first dose study drug give , one unit blood collect store self-donated blood transfusion surgery , patient whose red blood cell level show anemic , determined hematocrit level &gt; =35 % . Every 3 4 day thereafter , patient ' blood analyze one unit blood collect patient whose red blood cell level &gt; =35 % . A maximum 6 unit blood collect 3-week period surgery store self-donation . If sufficient unit surgery collect patient , preparation make patient receive need unit blood donor . Safety evaluation include laboratory test , physical examination , vital sign , record adverse event . The effectiveness epoetin alfa evaluate compare number self-donated unit blood collect treatment group , change hemoglobin , change hematocrit ( percent red blood cell whole blood ) , number immature red blood cell start study end study . The study hypothesis treatment epoetin alfa facilitate self-donation blood patient low hemoglobin hematocrit level undergo orthopedic surgery . Epoetin alfa 300 units/kilogram ( U/kg ) , epoetin alfa 600 U/kg , placebo , injection vein ; dose give twice weekly start 3 week surgery end surgery .</detailed_description>
