	<brief_title>A Study Factors That Affect Long-Term Kidney Transplant Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over time , chronic kidney graft dysfunction progressively threaten long-term survival kidney graft . The disease process behind graft dysfunction unclear . However , chronic kidney graft dysfunction likely cause certain definable factor . Such factor may include collagen III IV , transform growth factor ( TGF ) -beta , T B cell surface marker , cell cycle proteins , fibronectin , laminin . Determining disease process specific factor responsible kidney graft dysfunction may help design future interventional trial kidney transplant patient . The purpose study determine whether clinical , laboratory , histologic study time initial graft dysfunction clarify process factor lead deterioration loss kidney graft . This observational study enroll participant recently receive kidney transplant ( prospective cohort ) participant kidney transplant longer period time experience kidney graft dysfunction ( retrospective cohort ) . The duration trial may differ participant , depend deterioration kidney graft function occur . Participants follow graft loss death . There exclusive study visit associate study . Study data gather routine laboratory follow-up test complete participant 's local medical center information obtain time kidney biopsy . Participants may need undergo kidney biopsy clinically indicate . At time biopsy , participant also undergo urine blood collection .</detailed_description>
