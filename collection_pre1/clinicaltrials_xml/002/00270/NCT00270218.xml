	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Two Different HIV Vaccines , Each Followed Adenoviral Vaccine Boost , HIV Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evaluating immunogenicity HIV vaccines critical improve vaccine design development . The adenoviral vector HIV vaccine VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP show immunogenicity early study appear safe well tolerated three different dos prior dose-escalation vaccine trial HIV uninfected adult . The DNA HIV vaccine VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP show immunogenicity multiple clinical trial ; one trial , DNA vaccine demonstrate nearly 100 % CD4 T-cell response rate . The DNA plasmid vaccine code protein HIV subtypes A , B , C , together represent 90 % new HIV infection . This study determine safety immune response administration adenoviral vector HIV vaccine DNA HIV vaccine , follow adenoviral vaccine boost , HIV uninfected adult . This study last 1 year . Participants randomly assign one two group . Within group , participant randomly assign receive either vaccine control injection . Group 1 participant receive either placebo adenoviral HIV vaccine study entry Month 6 . Group 2 participant receive either placebo DNA HIV vaccine study entry Month 1 adenoviral HIV vaccine Month 6 . Participants ask record temperature side effect symptom log day vaccination 3 day thereafter report side effect . Group 1 participant 16 study visit , physical exam HIV pregnancy prevention counsel occur visit . Participants also ask side effect medication take . Blood collection occur visit . Urine collection occur select visit . Participants ask complete social impact assessment Months 2 , 6 , 12 test belief questionnaire Months 6 12 .</detailed_description>
