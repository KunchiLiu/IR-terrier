	<detailed_description>A previous study substitute zidovudine stavudine abacavir patient severe moderate lipoatrophy show increase limb fat ( DEXA ) . This study conduct 24 week period although improved outcome document objective measure , DEXA scan , subjective observation correspond . Longer-term follow patient require . This 48 week study design compare substitution thymidine analogue zidovudine ( ZDV ) stavudine ( D4T ) either tenofovir DF abacavir , patient treat highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , show improve outcome total limb fat mass , improve body shape dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan improve cholesterol tryglicerides .</detailed_description>
