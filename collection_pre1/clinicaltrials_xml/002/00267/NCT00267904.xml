	<brief_summary>Objectives : Plasma level catechols distinct meaning term indicate function endogenous catecholamine system . This Protocol design enable ongoing quality assurance diagnostic research assay catechols metabolite identify possible influence demographic anthropometric factor , dietary constituent , condition sample reference value . Study Populations : The study population healthy volunteer people obese untreated hypertension . Design : Arm venous blood drawn via indwell i.v . catheter healthy volunteer across demographic anthropometric spectrum ( age , gender , skin color , ethnicity , body mass , adiposity ) , obtain quality control plasma establish reference value plasma level catechols metabolite . Non-invasive physiological measure obtain concurrently . Levels catechols metabolite related result common clinical pathology test . Subgroups subject test , assess dietary influence ( cereal milk , coffee ) condition sample ( temperature skin ) . Outcome Measures : The main non-experimental outcome ongoing pool quality control plasma . The main experimental outcome measure plasma concentration catechols metabolite , non-invasive physiological measure , result common clinical pathology test . Subject group compare respect demographic anthropometric factor . Effects experimental manipulation assess within subject</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The subject healthy volunteer 18 year old pregnant lactating . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : &lt; TAB &gt; Minors young 18 year old exclude . A candidate subject exclude , judgment Principal Investigator , Protocol participation would place subject substantially increase acute medical risk . A candidate subject exclude , opinion Principal Investigator , medical risk outweigh potential scientific benefit . A candidate subject exclude disqualify condition . Examples disqualify condition hepatic failure , history tachyarrhythmias heart block , symptomatic congestive heart failure , severe anemia , psychosis , refractory ventricular arrhythmia , symptomatic coronary heart disease , diabetes mellitus , hyperthyroidism . Abnormal screen result may exclude participation , discretion Principal Investigator . Subjects exclude participation refer medical management , systolic blood pressure supine rest great equal 160 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure great equal 105 mm Hg . Alcohol use disorder . A candidate subject exclude clinical consideration require patient continue treatment drug likely interfere scientific result . Examples acetaminophen , angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker , adrenoceptor agonist antagonist , anticoagulant , anticonvulsant , antipsychotic , calcium channel blocker , hypoglycemic agent , digoxin , dopaminergic drug , monoamine oxidase inhibitor , oral contraceptive , sedative , steroid , tricyclic antidepressant . Patients discontinue medication , participate study . Subjects feel would difficult insert catheter vein may exclude . Pregnant lactate woman exclude . To exclude pregnancy , woman child bear potential blood test pregnancy , negative result obtain within 1 day day test . Candidate subject admit history alcohol addiction alcohol use disorder exclude study whole , especially important portion study involve ingest red wine . Candidate subject drink alcohol every day exclude portion study involve ingest red wine . People history sulfite allergy exclude portion study involve ingestion red wine . Subjects must least 21 year old order participate portion study involve ingestion red wine .</criteria>
