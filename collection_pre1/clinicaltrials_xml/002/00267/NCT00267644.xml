	<brief_summary>Objective : Although approximately 9 % patient present Pediatric Emergency Department ( ED ) dehydrate , reliable method measure objectively degree intravascular dehydration . Respiratory change Inferior Vena Cava ( IVC ) diameter show predict volume status adult . Previous research demonstrate correlation IVC diameter volume status child undergo hemodialysis . Other study show IVC diameter child sonographically measure rapidly accurately ED physician . If establish IVC diameter predicts volume status dehydrate child , tool could assist ED physician rapid diagnosis prompt resuscitation without need wait blood urine test . In study use `` dehydrated patient '' model hypovolemia , idea data could ultimately use set hypovolemic state . We aim evaluate whether ultrasound pediatric IVC use reliably assess volume status . Methods : This prospective cohort study . Pediatric ED patient range age 1 41 month assess Pediatric emergency physician stratify either clinically euvolemic hypovolemic . After consent obtain , one three Emergency Medicine Residents perform trans-abdominal sonographic measurement IVC diameter . Measurements IVC diameter caudal insertion hepatic vein obtain longitudinal orientation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Inferior Vena Cava ( IVC ) Dehydration Status Pediatric Emergency Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound consider routine procedure ED . In MMC ultrasound do ED staff document , however patient bill . All ultrasound image study approve Dr. Marshall prior inclusion study . For purpose study , trans-abdominal ultrasonographic measurement Inferior Vena Cava ( IVC ) take patient suspect Dehydrated . The Triage Nurse person would identify acutely dehydrated patient . Once potential candidate identify The Attending physician pediatric ED notify . If sonographer available ED time he/she free/willing perform sonogram attend physician notify consent patient . The first phase study concentrate establish correlation collapse IVC level dehydration . During first part study , ultrasonography perform prior hydration . During phase also perform sonogram control group . The Control Group consist child age 1 month 3 year age suspect dehydrate base initial evaluation presenting complaint . During second phase study measure change IVC diameter fluid resuscitation . During time , additional ultrasonography perform adequate fluid resuscitation . Return Visit : For patient qualify return visit weight check , upon arrival ED , bypass registration report triage nurse identify , weigh promptly send home . Who need return visit ? Any patient admit recent weight available ( PMD 's office ) prior onset current condition qualify return visit . The patient recent weight take PMD 's office request sign hospital standard consent transfer data via fax PMD 's office .</detailed_description>
