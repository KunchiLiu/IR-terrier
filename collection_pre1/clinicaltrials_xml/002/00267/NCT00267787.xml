	<detailed_description>To determine status previously identify anal cancer molecular marker correlation outcome well discover new molecular biomarkers correlate molecular data clinical outcome . Study tissue sample cell biopsy lesion blood sample . We hope learn role gene protein may play development anal cancer . Experiments perform use tissue blood , include analysis DNA , analysis RNA expression level , analysis protein level important gene product , development tissue culture cell line .</detailed_description>
