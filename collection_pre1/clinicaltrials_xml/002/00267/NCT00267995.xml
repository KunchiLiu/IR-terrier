	<brief_summary>The Ross procedure become surgery choice aortic valve replacement child . This consist take child 's pulmonary valve ( autograft ) replace child 's diseased aortic valve autograft . At time , involve either enlarge reduce diameter aortic annulus make valve fit properly . The patient 's pulmonary valve replace , typically human heart valve ( homograft ) . There concern literature time go , autograft dilate patient develop progressive aortic insufficiency . Since 1994 , perform almost 50 Ross procedure child young adult . Contrary many report literature , recognize problem autograft enlargement progressive aortic insufficiency . One thing do differently center modify insertion technique autograft native aortic root . This involve second buttressing suture layer . Not immediate effect reduce bleed complication , postulate long-term effect stabilize autograft prevent aortic root dilatation . We hypothesize proximal buttressing technique Ross procedure two-fold benefit . Firstly , reduces amount bleed postoperative period . Secondly , prevents late autograft root dilatation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This retrospective chart review examine experience Ross procedure . There treatment control group . The treatment group child Ross procedure proximal buttressing technique . The control comparison group would Ross procedure patient receive proximal buttressing technique . All child 's chart review patient surgery Children 's Healthcare Atlanta December 1994 August 2003 ; information available October 10 , 2003 use study . We review approximately 75 chart study . The first aim study would examine basic information regard bleed incidence . The following information collect group : - Amount chest tube bleed within first 24 hour , - Number patient require re-exploration bleed - Time cardiopulmonary bypass removal time leave operating room ( indicator need `` dry '' ) . The second aim study would review echocardiograms patient . The pulmonary valve size Ross procedure would measure preoperative transthoracic transesophageal echocardiogram . This would compare postoperative study Operating Room transesophageal echocardiography . The pre-discharge echocardiogram follow-up echocardiogram ( routine patient , therefore , would necessary add study protocol ) would review . Autograft root diameter would measure . The diameter would level valve leaflet , level commissure sinotubular ridge . These would compare publish Z value patient age , weight body surface area . At time , degree aortic insufficiency leave ventricular outflow tract obstruction would note record . One non-invasive cardiologist review old echocardiogram .</detailed_description>
