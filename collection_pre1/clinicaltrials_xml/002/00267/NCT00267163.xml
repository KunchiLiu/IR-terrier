	<detailed_description>Studies date show picture brain use PET ( positron emission tomography ) scan measure predict memory decline people genetic risk develop AD . They also show predict memory decline people mild memory complaint . These finding consistent evidence change Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) begin year doctor confirm diagnosis . In study , PET genetic risk study perform people mild memory complaint . A total 138 participant ( age 40 90 year ) risk memory decline enrol . They randomize ( like flip coin ) one two treatment group , donepezil ( medication treat mild AD ) placebo , follow 18 month evidence future decline . Participants receive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , PET scan , genetic risk assessment Alzheimer 's Disease , neuropsychological assessment . Repeat brain imaging study perform end 18-month treatment trial . These procedure allow researcher explore baseline brain function genetic risk AD onset influence brain metabolic rate memory decline , treatment outcome . Participants receive donepezil expect show less evidence decline receive placebo . This project expand grow research program early detection prevention AD , design ( 1 ) identify person without memory complaint likely benefit early intervention ( 2 ) provide objective way monitor activity brain .</detailed_description>
