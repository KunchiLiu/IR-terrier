	<brief_summary>This study investigate use chemotherapy plus highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) patient AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma . None drug use study experimental , chemotherapy plus HAART establish standard treatment patient AIDS . The chemotherapy regimen use study ( see ) chosen may less toxic immune cell call T-lymphocytes drug treatment lymphoma . People AIDS 18 old primary brain lymphoma may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , MRI , CT PET scan , cerebrospinal fluid study , brain biopsy tumor site , possible , electrocardiogram blood test . Participants undergo six 2-week `` induction treatment '' cycle HAART plus chemotherapy methotrexate , rituximab leucovorin , follow two 4-week `` consolidation '' treatment cycle use HAART , methotrexate leucovorin , HAART alone . Rituximab give intravenous ( IV , vein ) day 1 cycle . Also day 1 IV fluid give low acidity urine protect kidney methotrexate . On day 2 , methotrexate infuse vein 4 hour . Starting 24 hour initiation methotrexate infusion , leucovorin give every 3 6 hour ( first IV possibly mouth ) drug decrease target level blood . HAART begin soon possible . The specific HAART regimen patient determine individually . All patient hospitalize first week every 2-week treatment cycle safety monitoring . In addition HAART chemotherapy , patient undergo follow test procedure : - Intellectual functioning : Before start treatment , patient test ability understand basic concept coordination order able evaluate brain lymphoma affect think concentration . After lymphoma appear resolve , formal intensive test do . The intensive test repeat year , short , interim test do every 6 month . Also , specialist periodically monitor patient ' understand HAART importance therapy . - Blood test : Blood drawn every day hospitalization measure methotrexate level evaluate kidney liver function blood count . Blood also draw start therapy , lymphoma disappears , 6 month complete treatment , time appear lymphoma may recur test Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , virus almost always present AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma . - Imaging test : Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan periodically monitor effect treatment lymphoma . MRI scan do 2nd , 4th , 6th , 8th treatment , every 2 month three time , every 3 month six time , every 6 month four time , every year 5 year , sooner concern brain . PET scan do first cycle , MRI suggest lymphoma go , yearly . - Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) : This test do look EBV cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . Under local anesthetic , needle inserted space bone low back CSF circulate spinal cord small amount fluid collect needle . This test do time blood test EBV . - Eye examination : Patients ' eye examine periodically brain lymphoma sometimes spread eye people AIDS-related primary brain lymphoma risk certain eye infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : AIDS-related primary central nervous system lymphoma ( AR-PCNSL ) Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -driven lymphoproliferative process typically result death within month . Essentially case immunoblastic CD20+ tumor , occur CD4+ cell fall 50 cells/mm3 . Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) result immune reconstitution decrease risk AR-PCNSL . However , subset HIV-infected patient still develop ARPCNSL , often unaware HIV infect , take HAART . Treatment option patient limited . In non-AIDS setting , chemotherapy become standard care primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) late neurocognitive decline consequent radiotherapy avoid approach . In pre-HAART era , AR-PCNSL generally treat whole brain radiotherapy , however death due recurrent lymphoma AIDS complication occur prior potential manifestation late occur radiation-related neurotoxicity . Radiation-sparing approach study AR-PCNSL HAART era , advance antiretroviral therapy make curative intent chemotherapy feasible patient HIV infection . Objectives : The primary objective study estimate fraction patient AR-PCNSL receive experimental treatment consist HAART , combine rituximab , high-dose methotrexate leucovorin ( R-HD-MTX ) alive without recurrent lymphoma severe cognitive problem two year . Secondary objective include evaluation safety toxicity associate R-HD-MTX plus HAART patient AR-PCNSL well estimate complete response rate , progression-free , disease-free , overall survival long-term neurocognitive outcome . Additionally , study ass overall survival , progression-free survival , longterm neurocognitive outcome patient AR-PCNSL HD-MTX contraindicate therefore treated radiation-sparing therapy consist dose-modified , dose-dense rituximab combine HAART HD-MTX . Eligibility : HIV-infected , age 18 year old , AR-PCSNL previously treat , able give inform consent durable power attorney provide inform consent , HIV profile make likely respond HAART . There number specific inclusion exclusion criterion , part exclude patient would unlikely tolerate therapy . Design : Phase II pilot study investigate R-HD-MTX give leucovorin rescue HAART treatment AR-PCNSL . Evaluation include quantitative measurement lymphocyte subset , quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) HIV EBV viral load ( include blood cerebrospinal fluid case EBV ) ass immune response anti-viral effect . Tumor evaluation brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET scan ) use stag response assessment . Longitudinal neuropsychologic test complete response document serve evaluate neurocognitive parameter post therapy . separate cohort additional secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
