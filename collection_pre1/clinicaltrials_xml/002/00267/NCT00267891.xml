	<brief_summary>This study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) examine happen brain adolescent expose violent medium imagine aggressive behavior affect brain function . The study measure physiological change ( amount electricity generate skin , heart rate , breathe rate ) relate task fMRI . MRI use magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . For fMRI , subject performs certain task MRI scan examine change brain region involve task . During scan , subject lie metal cylinder ( scanner ) , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur scan . Healthy right-handed native English-speaking male 14 17 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen neurological examination neuropsychological test include question feeling , experience , behavior , test read level intelligence . Participants undergo fMRI fill questionnaires scan . Some child ask play 20 minute video game test . During scan , child view short neutral video clip video clip people fight imagine self-defense situation . The child ask rate video clip aggressive content tell feel imagine situation . Two small strap wrap around child 's index middle finger measure change amount electricity generate skin , strap ring finger measure child 's heart rate . A band around child 's chest record breathe rate . Children want undergo MRI testing may ask view commercially available video clip people fight neutral video scene , sport scene . They ask rate violent content excitement , rate video game play violent/nonviolent content popularity . In addition , child fill questionnaire medium use exposure violence . All participate family contact telephone 1 day 2 week experiment parent answer question child child answer question feeling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Changes Adolescents While Imagining Observing Aggressive Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective . The purpose protocol localize prefrontal cortical region mediate aggressive behavior . Utilizing two different experimental neuropsychological task functional MRI , investigate hypothesis regard role ventro-medial prefrontal cortex processing imagine observed aggressive behavior . Additionally , determine relationship non-frontal neural structure involve emotional expression , amygdala , prefrontal structure involve executive function may modulate aggressive behavior . We record skin conductance response ( SCRs ) , heart rate , respiration experiment investigate autonomic change process aggressive behavior . Study Population . In three separate study , normal adolescent volunteer participate experiment deal process aggressive behavior use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . In addition , conduct two pre-studies normal adolescent volunteer order determine appropriate stimulus fMRI study . Design . The experiment conduct employ within-subject , rapid event-related fMRI design determine whether observation imagination aggressive behavior deactivate ventro-medial prefrontal cortex ( VM-PFC ) vary intensity imagine observed aggressive act may influence change activation pattern VM-PFC . Outcome Measures . The data collect consist fMRI activation image correspond vary intensity observe imagined aggression , questionnaire result , amplitudes skin conductance response , heart rate , respiration parameter . The result gain protocol provide evidence role ventro-medial prefrontal cortex process aggressive behavior , particularly adolescent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : In study , participant consist male adolescent healthy , native Englishspeaking , righthanded volunteer . Participants range age 14 17 year old include regardless race . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Nonnative English speaker nonright handers exclude , nonneurologically normal volunteer . Subjects young 14 old 17 year age exclude . Subjects follow exclude MRI testing : aneurysm clip ; implant neural stimulator ; implant cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator ; cochlear implant ; ocular foreign body , metal shaving ; permanent eyeliner ; insulin pump ; irremovable body pierce exclude study due possible dangerous effect magnet upon metal object body . Individuals neurological psychiatric history , include significant aggressive behavior drug abuse , medical condition would compromise interpretation fMRI result exclude . Adolescents attentional , cognitive , learn difficulty impairment take part study . An intelligence quotient le 80 exclusion criterion study . Individuals current past history posttraumatic stress disorder psychiatric disorder individual history physical sexual abuse exclude may disturb exposure violent stimulus . Furthermore , exclude adolescent take centrally act medication . The presence absence condition determine standardized neuropsychiatric interview , questionnaire , ability testing , standard phone inperson intake ( see screen section ) .
