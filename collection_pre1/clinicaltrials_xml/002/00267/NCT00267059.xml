	<brief_title>Lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam . Blood ( 2-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . For patient take Coumadin , blood collect ( 2-4 teaspoon ) measure anticoagulation order closely monitor clot ability purpose adjust Coumadin dose , necessary . This blood test call INR ( International Standard Method follow anticoagulation ) . You bone marrow biopsy aspirate . To collect bone marrow biopsy aspirate , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . These two collection perform one single procedure . You also electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , take lenalidomide mouth every morning time 28 day . This consider 1 cycle . The dose schedule lenalidomide may adjust depend disease responds side effect experience . During study , blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) take week Cycle 1 stable dose lenalidomide find . You 1 tablespoon blood drawn every 2 week additional cycle month study . Blood test ( 1 tablespoon ) may do frequently dose medication need adjust experience side effect . Every month first 3 month , physical exam see . You physical exam every 3 month . After first 3 month treatment , bone marrow biopsy aspirate go collected evaluate response treatment . In participant continue receive treatment , bone marrow biopsy aspiration go repeat every 6 month first year , year study . You require return M. D. Anderson least month , first 3 month , stable dose lenalidomide establish . Following , required return least every 3 month take medication . Women able child must negative pregnancy test 10-14 day start therapy repeat pregnancy test 24 hour start lenalidomide , every week first 4 week , every 4 week regular menstruation , every 2 week period irregular , 30 day stop take lenalidomide . Only hysterectomy menstrual period least 24 month row , required pregnancy test use birth control . You may continue receive treatment long disease respond intolerable side effect occur . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Lenalidomide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone multiple myeloma . Lenalidomide use chronic lymphocytic leukemia consider experimental . Up 45 patient may take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
