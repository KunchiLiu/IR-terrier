	<brief_summary>Primary : 1 . To evaluate preliminary efficacy palifermin reduce incidence severity oral mucositis ( OM ) patient sarcoma receive multicycle chemotherapy . 2 . To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) palifermin give pre chemotherapy . 3 . To evaluate safety profile palifermin combine multicycle chemotherapy . Exploratory : 1 . To evaluate biologic effect palifermin oral mucosa . 2 . To investigate potential biomarker development biochemical analysis blood cell , serum , plasma . 3 . To investigate effect genetic variation mucositis gene , drug metabolism gene , drug target gene patient response treatment regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate PKs Efficacy Assessment Palifermin Patients With Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palifermin similar protein keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) naturally make body small amount . The function palifermin stimulate growth specific cell form tissue line mouth digestive tract . Damage cell result breakdown normal protective barrier cell usually provide , potentially result infection . If eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) receive either palifermin placebo vein 3 day cycle chemotherapy . This do 18 week ( total 12 injection ) . A placebo substance look like study drug , active ingredient . The infusion time last 15-30 second . At begin study , every 3 patient enrol study , 2 3 receive palifermin . Neither study doctor know study drug assign receive . Within 1 2 day receive first dose palifermin 48 72 hour receive first dose palifermin , additional non-invasive optical imaging procedure may perform . The purpose imaging procedure evaluate effect palifermin mucosa ( mucosal thickness ) . The type optical imaging may do include optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , fluorescence reflectance spectroscopy , confocal microscopy . The oral cavity inspect photograph . A probe size pen place one two sit oral buccal mucosa . A beam light direct oral tissue optical signal collect site . This take 1 minute site . Before use probe new participant , disinfect per standard practice . You receive adriamycin ifosfamide cisplatin chemotherapy . Adriamycin give continuous infusion central venous catheter ( CVC ) 3 day . Ifosfamide give intravenously ( intravenously ( IV ) -- needle vein ) CVC 3 hour , every day 4 day . Mesna give 24-hour IV infusion CVC every day 4 day catheter . Mesna use protect bladder-related side effect . For patient certain type sarcoma , vincristine give catheter rapid infusion Day 1 . In patient bone sarcoma , cisplatin give first day IV intra-arterial infusion around 4 hour instead ifosfamide . You need come M. D. Anderson every 3 week 4 5 month treatment period , unless doctor decides need come frequently . At visit , vital sign measure routine blood test ( 3 teaspoon ) perform . In addition , may oral cavity examine photograph receive study drug . Every effort make take photograph identify . Additional blood sample ( 3 teaspoon ) take cycle frequently need measure blood count test monitor drug side effect treatment effect . By end study , give 10 tablespoon blood . This amount include optional blood draw choose allow drawn . You responsible notify study staff ( doctor visit phone study staff ) side effect experience medication ( counter prescription ) take treatment period . You also require notify doctor ( separate study doctor ) see participate research study . If anemia becomes severe study , transfusion may recommend . If mucositis develop , prohibit medicine allow treatment condition . If experience intolerable side effect study , may take study . If leave study early reason , doctor continue follow progress 4 week access medical record minimum 1 year last dose study drug ( either palifermin placebo ) give . At end study visit , evaluate disease status image study [ compute tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) ] weight vitals sign measure . You report medication take since last visit side effect blood transfusion . You also final blood draw ( 3 teaspoon ) routine test . The total length involvement study expect 18 week ( 4 5 month ) .</detailed_description>

Prior surgery radiotherapy ( RT ) within 2 week study entry . 7 . Prior treatment palifermin , keratinocyte growth factor ( eg , KGF2 ) . 8 . Thirty day less since receive investigational product device another clinical trial . Current enrollment another clinical trial permit unless sole purpose trial obtain posttreatment data subject ( eg , longterm followup survival data ) . 9 . Known sensitivity product administer study , include Escherichia coliderived product . 10 . Psychological , social , familial , geographical reason would prevent schedule visit followup . 11 . Patients history pancreatitis .</criteria>
