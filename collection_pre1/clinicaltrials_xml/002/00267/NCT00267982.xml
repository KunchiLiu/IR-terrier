	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Ectopic Atrial Tachycardia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ectopic Atrial Tachycardia ( EAT ) relatively rare arrhythmia pediatric population . It define run 3 premature atrial contraction together . In EAT , arrhythmia tends increase rate period time slow gradually normal rhythm . Ectopic Atrial Tachycardia ( EAT ) mostly encounter patient structurally normal heart however , occasionally physicians observe type disorder child follow surgery congenital heart defect . Current report suggest EAT occurs approximately 1 10,000 child ( Hamilton , 2002 ) . Children EAT usually present multitude symptom . The common symptom associate pediatric EAT palpitation , chest pain , lightheadedness , presyncope , dyspnea . Other symptom include exercise intolerance congestive heart failure . These usually late manifestation . In patient tachycardia induced CM , time development CM dependent rate duration tachycardia however , case , dilation present upon diagnosis . This CM reverse successful treatment arrhythmia . The treatment chronic EAT include medication adenosine difficult control case , Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA ) . RF ablation successful curing EAT , success rate range 75-100 % . It show complication rate similar RF ablation procedure , high risk recurrence ( Hamilton , 2002 ) . At Children 's Healthcare Atlanta , cardiac catheterization lab performs approximately 10 Radiofrequency ablation EAT year . The goal retrospective review ass frequency recurrence EAT among subset patient receive treatment August 1992 - August 2003</detailed_description>
