	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Neuroprotective Effect PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Versus Placebo Cancer Patients Who Develop Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral neuropathy debilitate disease nerve dose-limiting toxicity chemotherapeutic agent . The symptoms peripheral neuropathy lead considerable patient distress discomfort , discontinuation chemotherapy , limitation regard selection future chemotherapeutic regimen . Symptoms numbness , weakness , burn pain ( especially night ) , loss reflex may take month improve permanent deficit may remain . Epoetin alfa , already use treatment chemotherapy-induced anemia , show neuroprotective effect preclinical study . The purpose randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug placebo take , dosage ) , placebo-controlled study evaluate neuroprotective effect PROCRIT ( epoetin alfa ) administer every week patient cancer develop chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy due treatment combination Taxane Platinum-Based chemotherapy . Patients receive injection subcutaneously intravenously either epoetin alfa placebo weekly 18 week . Doses may adjust range 20,000 60,000 Units week , depend patient 's hemoglobin level . Safety evaluation conduct throughout study specify interval consist assessment laboratory test ( Hemoglobin level , Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) , Blood Chemistries ) , vital sign , physical examination occurrence severity adverse event . In addition , occurrence anti-erythropoietin antibody baseline study completion/early withdrawal evaluated patient receive PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) database lock unblinding occur . The primary measure effectiveness change Week 12 National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCI CTC ) neuropathy score . The study hypothesis epoetin alfa effective treatment chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy placebo measure Week 12 National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCI CTC ) neuropathy score . Patients receive injection subcutaneously ( SC , skin ) intravenously ( IV , vein ) either epoetin alfa placebo weekly 18 week . Doses may adjust depend patient 's hemoglobin level maximum 60,000 Units week . The minimum dose 20,000 Units week .</detailed_description>
