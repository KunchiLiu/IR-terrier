	<brief_title>Measuring Preferences Childbirth After Cesarean</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As cesarean birth rate continue climb , number woman ( currently 420,000 annually ) face decision whether repeat cesarean attempt vaginal birth cesarean ( VBAC ) also increase . The objective propose 18-month exploratory research study help pregnant woman weigh risk benefit childbirth decision use Preferences Assessment Computer Module develop principal investigator . The long-term objective propose research understand improve decision-making process woman create computerized childbirth decision aid . Such decision aid provide value decision complex , outcome uncertain , people vary prioritize preference ; childbirth decision woman prior cesarean meet criterion . No study date quantifies woman weigh complexity various considerations—medical otherwise—in delivery decision . The propose research significant , therefore , provide much-needed method help woman prioritize weigh preference relate childbirth decision . More broadly , respond recent NIH AHRQ initiatives promote development computerize decision aid improve quality medical decision . A new investigator lead well-qualified , multi-disciplined team expertise decision analysis , obstetric medicine , research methodology pursuit follow specific aim : 1 . To validate precise method measure childbirth preference . During initial phase study , verify accuracy Preferences Assessment Computer Module , measure internal consistency ass content validity cross-sectional study . 2 . To test whether woman use Preferences Assessment Computer Module increase clarity preferences—and implication preferences—in comparison woman control group . We conduct randomize controlled trial pregnant woman prior cesarean . This Preferences Assessment Computer Module appropriate address VBAC decision , also decision related elective cesarean induction . In short , propose research advance field improve quality decision-making process childbirth .</detailed_description>
