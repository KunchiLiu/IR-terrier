	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn give 1 2 CML ( Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ) vaccine ( CML-VAX B2 CML-VAX B3 ) together imatinib mesylate decrease eliminate evidence disease patient CML remission treatment imatinib mesylate , still small amount detectable disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Synthetic Vaccine Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Minimal Residual Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients eligible take part study already respond well treatment imatinib mesylate . Your disease call complete cytogenetic remission ( i.e. , The Philadelphia chromosome longer detectable. ) . However , still small amount disease detect use sensitive technique available . CML-VAX B2 CML-VAX B3 experimental vaccine make protein cause leukemia cell CML behave abnormally . Imatinib mesylate standard therapy CML block function protein . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete physical exam medical history . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) collect routine test . You also bone marrow aspiration chromosome analysis number chromosomes bone marrow . To collect bone marrow aspiration , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . You also additional blood work ( 1 tablespoon ) test level leukemia blood . If agree participate study , test repeat 2 time , 2 week apart , start vaccination . This do get good measure amount disease may . There 2 different vaccine use study , CML-VAX B2 CML-VAX B3 . If find eligible take part study , receive one . Which one receive depend type protein leukemia make , vaccine specific 2 common protein may produce CML cell . All participant study receive 1 2 vaccine well imatinib mesylate . Imatinib mesylate continue give dose take . The vaccine mix substance call montanide . This standard procedure vaccine do try make likely good immune response vaccines general . When appropriate vaccine select use , receive injection vaccine every 2 week first 8 week , 3 week later , every month total 15 vaccine 12 month . You receive vaccine M. D. Anderson . The vaccine inject arm thigh . Two day vaccination day vaccination , receive injection growth hormone call GM-CSF ( Leukine ) . The purpose injection boost immune system , response vaccine , specifically kill leukemia . This injection give small needle injected skin arm thighs . You teach , may choose give member study staff . Every time come injection vaccine , also physical exam routine blood work do ( 2 tablespoon ) . Every 3 month receive vaccine also blood drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) test level leukemia see respond vaccine . You take study intolerable side effect occur disease come remission . About 2 week last injection vaccine , blood drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) test level leukemia see respond . This investigational study . CML-VAX B2 CML-VAX B3 FDA approve . The vaccine montanide free . Because receive imatinib mesylate part standard care , and/or insurance company third-party payer responsible cost . If GM-CSF cover insurance third-party payer , provide free charge . A maximum 60 patient take part study . A maximum 20 enrol M. D. Anderson . Optional Procedures : If agree , additional blood test ( 3 tablespoon ) do 30 day first vaccine , 6 month 9 month start vaccination , ( 10 tablespoon ) day first vaccine 3 month 2 week last vaccine measure response immune system vaccine . If agree , skin test do small amount protein inject skin another measure response immune system . If small nodule develop area receive injection , may represent immune response . This measured doctor nurse . You agree take part optional procedure order receive treatment study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients Ph chromosome positive BCRABLpositive CML ( determine cytogenetics , FISH , RTPCR ) . 2 . Patients must reach 18th birthday . 3 . Patients must receive imatinib therapy least 12 month must change dose imatinib last 6 month . Patients must continuous interruption imatinib therapy great 14 day total 6 week 6 month prior enrollment . 4 . Patients must complete cytogenetic remission confirm two marrow , second least one month first . 5 . Patients must detectable BCRABL transcript level 0.5log low low value obtain last 6 month , least two value obtain period . 6 . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 . 7 . Adequate organ function define : bilirubin &lt; 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , creatinine &lt; 1.5x ULN , ALT AST &lt; 2.5x ULN . 8 . All patient must inform investigational nature study must sign give write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . 9 . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal 24 month surgically sterile ) must agree use effective method contraception . 1 . Patients history accelerate blast crisis . Accelerated phase define 15 30 % blast &gt; 30 % blast plus promyelocytes peripheral blood marrow , &gt; 20 % basophil , platelet &lt; 100 x 10^9/L , unrelated therapy . Cytogenetic abnormality addition Ph chromosome consider defining feature accelerate phase . 2 . Patients autoimmune disorder know immune deficiency . 3 . Patients receive immunosuppressive therapy , corticosteroid , chemotherapy , therapy CML imatinib . 4 . Patients receive investigational agent . 5 . Patients pregnant breastfeeding . 6 . Patients clinically significant heart disease ( New York Heart Association Class III IV ) serious intercurrent illness , active uncontrolled infection require antibiotic active bleeding . 7 . Patients undergone major surgery within 28 day registration , fully recover prior major surgery . 8 . Patients undergone stem cell transplantation . 9 . Patients receive radiation therapy within 4 week enrollment .</criteria>
