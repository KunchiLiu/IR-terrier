	<criteria>A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion meet : Subject provide write informed consent . Subject must female ≥18 year age . Subjects ' original endometrial carcinoma ( histologic type ) must pathologic confirmation . Subject must recurrent persistent endometrial cancer . Subject must least one measurable lesion accord GOGmodified RECIST criterion . Measurable disease must accurately measure least one dimension ( long dimension record ) . Each lesion must ≥ 20 mm measure conventional technique , include palpation , plain Xray , CT MRI , ≥10 mm measure spiral CT. Measurable disease find chest Xray must confirm CT MRI . Either CT MRI must use throughout study evaluate lesion . The diagnostic method ( CT , MRI , Xray physical exam ) use evaluate disease , must use throughout study consistently evaluate lesion . Palpable tumor mass evaluate CT MRI scan evaluate ultrasound confirm biopsy . Evaluable disease ( measurable nonmeasurable ) may field prior radiation provide least six week elapse since receive radiation disease progression clearly document radiographic study . It preferential target lesion locate outside irradiated field . Nonmeasurable disease define lesion , include small lesion ( long diameter &lt; 20 mm conventional technique &lt; 10 mm spiral CT scan ) . Subject receive one prior chemotherapy regimen ( exclude topoisomerase I inhibitors e.g. , HYCAMTIN irinotecan ) . Subject allow receive , require receive , one additional prior noncytotoxic regimen management recurrent persistent disease accord follow definition : Noncytotoxic ( biologic cytostatic ) agent include , limited , monoclonal antibody , cytokine , small molecule inhibitor signal transduction . UM2004/00031/00 CONFIDENTIAL HCT100414 20 Subject least 21 day prior chemotherapy least 30 day prior noncytotoxic therapy recover associated toxicity . Subject must receive radiotherapy least seven day . Subject must least three week since last major surgery ( less period acceptable deem best interest subject ) . Subject must ECOG Performance Status 0 1 ( refer Appendix 4 , ECOG Performance Status ) . Subject must , screen , probable life expectancy least three month . Subject childbearing potential must practice adequate contraception [ e.g. , oral contraceptive , diaphragm plus spermicide , intrauterine device ( IUD ) ] show document complete abstinence intercourse least three month prior study start . The contraceptive method use throughout study continue least four week end study . A subject consider childbearing potential surgically sterile postmenopausal ( i.e. , document absence menses one year prior entry study ) . 14 . Subject must screen laboratory criterion follow : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL . Neutrophils ≥ 1,500/mm³ [ ≥1.5 x 10^9/L ] . Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm³ [ ≥100.0 x 10^9/L ] . Creatinine ≤ upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance ( Clcreat ) ≥ 60mL/min . Creatinine clearance calculate use CockcroftGault formula : Clcreat ( mL/min ) = ( 140age [ yr ] x body wt [ kg ] x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine [ mg/dL ] OR Clcreat ( mL/min ) = 1.05 x ( 140age [ yr ] x body wt [ kg ] serum creatinine [ μmol/L ] Serum bilirubin within normal limit . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2xULN liver metastasis absent abdominal CT MRI &lt; 5xULN liver metastasis present . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion meet : Subject pregnant lactating . Subject receive one prior chemotherapy regimen . UM2004/00031/00 CONFIDENTIAL HCT100414 21 Subject concomitant history previous malignancy , exception adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer subject diseasefree five year . Subject active uncontrolled infection . Subject brain metastasis document CT MRI . Note : Asymptomatic subject require CT MRI rule brain metastasis . Subject receive prior treatment HYCAMTIN . Subject history allergic reaction compound chemicallyrelated HYCAMTIN constituent . Subject receive investigational agent within 30 day five halflives ( whichever longer ) prior study entry .</criteria>
