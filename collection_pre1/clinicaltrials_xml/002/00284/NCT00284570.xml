	<brief_summary>First , , researcher , hope find PCT response heart surgery child take blood surgery day four day surgery . These blood draw help u figure typical Procalcitonin ( PCT ) response , normal increase PCT heart surgery , PCT level return baseline . Second , , researcher , hope determine accuracy PCT marker infection . Hypothesis Our hypothesis Procalcitonin superior currently use marker infection prove clinically useful tool evaluation infection child follow cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pro-Calcitonin Levels Following Pediatric Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In research study , want look difficulty identify infection child heart surgery . We also want look differentiate actual infection normal post-surgery course patient go . We use number tool Intensive Care Unit pick child risk infection . These tool physical examination , fever , white blood cell count , C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) level . When patient infection , usually fever , high white blood cell count , increase CRP level . However , always correct . The identification infection remain challenge laboratory marker infection ( white blood cell count CRP ) use perfect . A new marker infection , Procalcitonin ( PCT ) , find test adult child . PCT recently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) marker infection . PCT show accurate marker infection group patient . Prior work small number child show PCT increase shortly heart surgery , even without infection . There little information publish accurate PCT identify infection child heart population . In order use PCT patient , need know normal level PCT surgery . Thus , infection happen , identify . We also need take PCT level patient think infection . We need watch infection next day see PCT level rise actually predict presence infection . Goals : 1 . Determine Procalcitonin response cardiopulmonary bypass child undergo open-heart surgery . Cardiopulmonary bypass cause pro-inflammatory state patient , associate rise Procalcitonin . The ability use PCT marker infection require knowledge typical response bypass time course return baseline . 2 . Determine accuracy Procalcitonin marker infection , compare contrast finding currently use laboratory marker . Specific Aims 1 . Evaluate PCT postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patient marker infection sepsis . 2 . Evaluate PCT 's response cardiopulmonary bypass , predictor outcome follow cardiac surgery . 3 . Compare PCT marker inflammation infection ( C-reactive protein white blood cell response ) . By study , hope find two thing . First , hope find PCT response heart surgery child take blood surgery day four day surgery . These blood draw help u figure typical PCT response , normal increase PCT heart surgery , PCT level return baseline . Second , hope determine accuracy PCT marker infection . Whenever think patient may infection , routine care take blood run lab test white blood cell count , blood culture , C-reactive protein level . Patients study also additional 10 drop blood take PCT level time routine blood draw . Even though patient may show sign infection , routine blood test always come back positive infection . We compare routine blood test result ( positive negative infection ) PCT level take time . If patient infection also rise PCT patient without infection normal PCT , prove PCT good , accurate marker infection patient . This research help u study infection patient . It help distinguish patient infection , risk factor , treat , response infection . This information potentially allow u use improved test identify infection high-risk population child . Patients research project continue receive standard care treatment heart surgery change care study .</detailed_description>
