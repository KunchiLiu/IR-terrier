	<brief_summary>This study intend determine whether optimal treatment acute Achilles tendon rupture surgical repair functional bracing . Our hypothesis surgical repair : 1 ) Result clinically relevant decrease re-rupture rate 2 ) Result clinically relevant improvement disease specific quality life 3 ) A clinically relevant improvement functional outcome measure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Operative Versus Non-operative Treatment Achilles Tendon Rupture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology This study multi-centre prospective randomize control clinical trial . This study conduct five tertiary care centre orthopaedic surgeon interest soft tissue trauma . All subject recruit one year period . Subjects meet follow inclusion exclusion criterion consent involvement study randomize either operative non-operative arm study . All patient enter study receive pre-treatment ultrasound document tear complete document location tear . Prior obtain consent study risk benefit treatment option clearly explain along current state knowledge concern treatment Achilles tendon rupture . It explain study participant involvement study voluntary free discontinue involvement point treatment . Inclusion Criteria - Complete Achilles Tendon Rupture - Less 7 day date injury - Age 18-70 year age - Ability follow rehab protocol Exclusion Criteria - Inability Speak English - Significant ipsilateral injury - Open injury Achilles tendon - Neurological disease ( ie stroke , cerebral palsy ) - Collagen Disease ( ie Ehlers Danlos disease ) - Pregnancy - Fluoroquinolone associate rupture ( rupture within 2 week take medication ) - Unfit surgery - Diabetes - Peripheral Vascular disease - Avulsion Achilles tendon calcaneus Surgical Repair If randomize operative group , patient evaluate informed consent obtain . Surgery perform outpatient day surgery . Prophylactic antibiotic give one hour prior procedure . All patient receive general anaesthesia endotracheal intubation . The patient position prone bolster operative table . A tourniquet apply thigh affected extremity inflate 300 mmHg start case . The affected limb prepare draped standard fashion . A medial lateral curvilinear incision utilzed . The posterior aspect tendon tendon sheath expose . Evacuation overlie clot expose rupture tendon . Two ethibond suture place end torn tendon ( total four suture ) . Two ethibond suture place modified Bunnel stitch fashion enter tear site , first go proximally towards normal tendon distally towards calcaneus . With foot neutral alignment suture tie proximally distally normal tendon away tear site . A 2-0 vicryl suture place site repair run fashion augment repair . The wound irrigate tendon sheath close run 2-0 run vicryl stitch . The skin close interrupted 3-0 nylon suture sterile dress tubigrip apply . In recovery room patient fit plaster backslab gravity plantar flexion ( approx . 20 degree ) . Postoperative Protocol Patients instruct non-weight bearing injured side crutch assistance see outpatient clinic 7-10 day . Patients fit Air Cast Boot splint . Patients instructed weight bear tolerate injured side crutch assistance period six week . Patients allow active plantar flexion dorsiflexion neutral physiotherapy supervision . The Air Cast Boot remove therapy worn otherwise protection . At six week patient splint remove allow weight bear tolerate . At six week interval patient also begin perform dorsiflexion stretch exercise begin graduate resistance exercise . Follow appointments 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year 2 year follow surgery . Functional Bracing Treatment If randomize functional bracing group , subject Air Cast Boot splint apply 2cm felt heel lift . Ath two week heel lift remove . As operative group patient weight bear tolerate injured side crutch assistance six week . Similarly , subject allow remove Air Cast Boot perform active plantar flexion dorsiflexion neutral physiotherapy supervision . At six week patient Cast Boots remove dorsiflexion stretch exercise begin . A gentle resistance program also begin six week along dorsiflexion stretch exercise . Follow appointments 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year 2 year follow initial injury . Re-rupture Rate Complications The primary outcome measure re-rupture rate . This determine follow-up interval : 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 2 year Re-rupture rate operative non-operative group calculate statistically analyse use student 's test . P value less 0.05 consider significant . Any clinical suspicion re-rupture require ultrasound confirmation . Re-ruptures treat surgically . At listed follow-up interval complication also record include : Minor complication - superficial infection - wound hematoma - delay wound heal - scar adhesion - sensory disturbance - suture granuloma Major Complications - re-rupture - equinus postioning foot - extreme lengthen tendon - deep infection - chronic fistula - necrosis skin - deep vein thrombosis - embolism - death Range Motion , Strength Calf Circumference Range motion calf circumference document 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year 2 year . Active range motion record avoid healing setback . Calf circumference record compare unaffected extremity . Strength Testing Strength test perform study participant . This do follow-up visit 6 month , 1 year 2 year . These measurement include peak torque total work . A cybex dynamometer use test isokinetic concentric plantar dorsiflexion strength 30 , 90 240 degree per second . All value compare opposite unaffected side . Scores transformed percentage unaffected side point award appropriately per outcome measure design Leppilahti et al . Disease Specific Quality Life In debate surround effective management Achilles tendon rupture , surgeon argue individual factor signifies success . Many author suggest re-rupture rate consider measure successful treatment , others suggest minor complication return sport may also warrant consideration . This study utilize previously publish outcome score system attempt evaluate important factor recovery injury . This measurement tool publish Leppilahti et al utilizes combination factor include pain , stiffness footwear restriction well objective strength value , arrive overall score . Statistical analysis use student test apply outcome score mean operative non-operative group . P value less 0.05 consider significant . The application score system prospective randomize trial compare operative non-operative treatment condition hopefully shed much need light therapeutic dilemma .</detailed_description>
