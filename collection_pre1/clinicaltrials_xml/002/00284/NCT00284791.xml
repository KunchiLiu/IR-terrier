	<detailed_description>Mood disorder youth , include Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) Bipolar Disorder ( BPD ) , highly prevalent , associated significant mortality morbidity . Many youth major depression fail first-line treatment psychotherapy psychotropic medication . Lamotrigine ( Lamictal® ) recently gain approval FDA maintenance treatment bipolar disorder adult . A pilot study also show promising result lamotrigine ( LTG ) treatment refractory mood disorder youth adult , especially depressive symptom ( Carandang et al. , 2003 ; Frye et al. , 2000 ) . For propose study , modify design begin adolescent major depressive disorder respond trial selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant ( SSRI ) , fluoxetine , adequate dose duration , randomize either second SSRI fluoxetine augment lamotrigine . Non-responders 8 week fluoxetine , least 40 mg/day , discontinue fluoxetine adverse effect , would randomize : ( A ) continue fluoxetine lamotrigine augmentation , 8 week , active arm original Stage 2 , ( B ) discontinue fluoxetine begin second SSRI , 8 week . We use sertraline second SSRI , data support efficacy randomize placebo-controlled trial Wagner , et.al . ( JAMA , '03 ) . Citalopram also possibility ( Wagner et.al , Am J. Psychiatry '04 ) , use short period time sertraline . To maintain blind , B group receive placebo augmentation . The assessment outcome measure would original study . We consult primary care office coach initial , Stage 1 , fluoxetine trial office , monitor progress adolescent start fluoxetine clinic . Consent discuss respond , treatment study involve post-randomization treatment . Background Mood disorder youth common debilitate . Early-onset mood disorder often indicate severe illness , high likelihood recurrence adulthood . For prepubertal child , point prevalence MDD 2 % , 6 % adolescent , lifetime prevalence MDD adolescents 20 % ( Birmaher et al. , 2002 ) . The duration Major Depressive Episode youth range 3 9 month , 10 % lasting 2 year , 60-70 % recur adulthood , 20-40 % develop Bipolar Disorder within 5 year ( Weller Weller , 2000 ) . The prevalence prepubertal bipolar disorder estimate 0.5 % . Prevalence bipolar disorder adolescent 1 % ( Lewinshon et al. , 1995 ) . Suicide third lead cause death 15 – 24 year old age group ( 10.1 per 100,000 ) fifth lead cause 5 – 14 year old group ( 0.7 per 100,00 ) , highly correlate MDD BPD ( Pfeffer , 2002 ) .
