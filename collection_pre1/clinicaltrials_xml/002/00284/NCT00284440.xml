	<brief_title>Choroidal Blood Flow Response Hand-grip Test Progressive Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma worldwide lead cause blindness . The key feature glaucoma damage optic nerve head progressive visual field defect , necessarily related increase intraocular pressure . It suggest ocular blood flow alteration glaucoma relate systemic vascular dysregulations.The hand-grip test suggest potential tool unravel vascular dysregulation ocular circulation . Although applied routinely clinical practice , proper study test effectiveness test lacking . The present study design compare response choroidal blood flow hand-grip test glaucoma patient without visual field progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients fulfil two three follow criterion one eye : ) typical glaucomatous disc , b ) visual field damage ( cluster three point ( except rim point ) least one hemifield reduce 5 dB great include least one point reduce 10 dB great ; cluster two point reduce 10 dB great ; three adjacent point nasal horizontal meridian differ 5 dB great mirror point opposite side meridian ) , c ) intraocular pressure 21 mm Hg least one occasion . Furthermore , patient need series least 5 visual field examination , exclusion first test , assessment progression .
