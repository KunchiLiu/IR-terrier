	<brief_summary>This research study involve anti-cancer medication trastuzumab investigational drug vinflunine . The purpose trial see trastuzumab vinflunine use combination vinflunine alone effective treatment metastatic breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinflunine Plus Trastuzumab Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2neu ) Over-Expressing Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If tumor HER2neu positive , eligible patient receive trastuzumab vinflunine intravenously ( IV ) every 3 week . If tumor HER2neu negative , eligible patient receive vinflunine intravenously ( IV ) every 3 week . Patients whose cancer grow decrease size may continue receive treatment cancer progression . Evaluation cancer every 9 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer metastatic disease . Patients without pathologic cytologic confirmation metastatic disease unequivocal evidence metastasis use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) status tumor use stratify patient . Tumors HER2 FISH+ receive vinflunine trastuzumab . Patients tumor HER2 FISH negative HER2 status unknown/not perform remain study receive single agent vinflunine . Patients must measurable disease directly irradiate per RECIST criterion . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Prior Therapy : Patients must receive prior chemotherapy metastatic breast setting . Patients receive prior anthracyclines taxanes consider agent . Patients may receive prior chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy early stage breast cancer . The chemotherapy regimen may include anthracycline and/or taxane long &gt; 6 month since completion regimen . Adjuvant trastuzumab allow . Patients may receive prior radiation therapy either metastatic early stage set long &lt; 25 % bone marrow treat . Prior radiation whole pelvis allow . Radiation therapy must complete least 7 day prior study registration , radiation related toxicity must resolve grade â‰¤ 1 patient eligible study inclusion . Patients may receive number hormonal therapy neoadjuvant , adjuvant metastatic setting . Age &gt; 18 year . Life expectancy &gt; 6 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; 2 . Patients must normal organ marrow function . Laboratory test complete within 14 day prior start study treatment . Only patient receive trastuzumab , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) may determine either echocardiography multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan , obtain within 4 week prior start study treatment . Fertility/reproduction . Patients must pregnant , expect become pregnant conceive child time first signing study consent least 12 week last dose study treatment . Exclusion Criteria Patients receive prior vinca alkaloid chemotherapy eligible unless treatment complete &gt; 5 year ago . Patients HER2 status unknown FISH negative receive trastuzumab eligible treatment single agent vinflunine . Patients receive prior chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer . Patients receive trastuzumab must receive cumulative dose doxorubicin less 360mg/m2 , and/or epirubicin cumulative dose less 720mg/m2 study entry . Patients know leptomeningeal carcinomatosis exclude clinical trial History grade 3 4 allergic reaction attribute trastuzumab . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
