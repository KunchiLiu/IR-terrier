	<brief_summary>The purpose study estimate number case rheumatic heart disease , pyoderma , scabies school age child Fiji . In addition study describe feature rheumatic heart disease , pyoderma , scabies child . Study participant include 5200 primary school child , age 5-14 , 21 primary school Central Division Fiji . These child examine pyoderma , scabies , doctor listen heart stethoscope . Any child heart murmur detect heart look echocardiogram test ( use sound wave create picture heart work ) . Any child find rheumatic heart disease refer pediatric cardiologist evaluation . Participants involve study 2 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study first 5 study ( include DMID protocols 05-0081 , 05-0082 , 05-0117 , 06-0081 ) large project aim evaluate epidemiology infection cause group A streptococcus ( GAS ) Fiji - large project call Fiji Group A Streptococcal Project ( Fiji GrASP ) . Fiji GrASP turn part large program aim progression novel GAS vaccine - program project entitle `` Global GAS Vaccine Based On The M-Protein '' . The three broad aim Fiji GrASP epidemiologic study : establish burden disease GAS infection Fiji ; describe molecular epidemiology GAS isolate Fiji ; establish natural immunologic correlate protection J8 vaccine exist . The Fiji GrASP epidemiologic study important vaccine clinical trial gain clear picture burden GAS disease , develop ongoing surveillance clinical endpoint vaccine trial , collect isolate GAS Fiji , investigate immune correlate vaccine protection , prepare exist clinical trial site trial J-8 base vaccine . The primary objective study estimate prevalence rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) primary school age child Fiji estimate prevalence pyoderma child . Secondary objective : estimate prevalence scabies primary school age child Fiji ; describe clinical echocardiographic feature RHD child ; describe clinical feature pyoderma scabies child . Approximately 5,200 primary school child , 5-14 year age , 21 primary school Central Division Fiji participate study . They examine pyoderma scabies , standard auscultation pediatrician . Any child murmur screen echocardiogram mitral aortic valve . If abnormality valve identify another pathology suspect , child refer pediatric cardiologist full echocardiogram . The primary endpoint study determine prevalence echocardiogram confirm rheumatic heart disease determine prevalence pyoderma assess use standardized tool . The secondary endpoint determine : prevalence scabies assess use standardized tool ; prerevalence heart failure sign ventricular enlargement child echocardiographically-confirmed RHD ; distribution severity valvular lesion child echocardiographically-confirmed RHD ; prevalence severe pyoderma body distribution ( upper v lower ) lesion ; prevalence scabies , severe scabies body distribution ( upper v lower ) scabies lesion .</detailed_description>
