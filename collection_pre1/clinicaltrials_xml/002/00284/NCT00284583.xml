	<detailed_description>Interdigital neuroma , Morton ’ Neuroma , painful forefoot disorder characterize plantar pain paresthesia radiate toe . The condition first described 1845 Lewis Durlacher painful “ neuralgic affection ” plantar nerve third fourth metatarsal . T.G . Morton , 1876 , attribute painful symptom complex “ neuroma. ” His observation confirm Hoadley , 1893 , perform curative excision `` neuroma '' third fourth metatarsal . Current understanding interdigital neuroma base Gauthier ’ conclusion 1979 symptom complex result entrapment neuropathy interdigital nerve overlie transverse metatarsal ligament . Presently , definitive single etiology confirm . Additional potential pathoetiologies include aberrant anatomy plantar nerve location , trauma extrinsic mass effect level transverse metatarsal ligament . ( 3,6 ) The histological appearance affect nerve , however , consistent suggest “ neuroma ” misnomer condition . The nerve tissue demonstrate demyelination deposition amorphous eosinophilic material , exuberant proliferation nerve ending characteristic neuroma . ( 3 ) Multiple treatment recommend management interdigital neuroma . The usual algorithm begin attempt conservative therapy consist shoe wear modification application metatarsal pad . Failure conservative management may prompt trial corticosteroid injection . ( 8 ) Persistent symptom ultimately require surgical excision division transverse metatarsal ligament , good long term outcomes literature . ( 2,7 ) Recently , serial ethanol injection therapy report effective alternative surgical excision widely adopt treatment Morton ’ neuroma . Dockery et . al . report 89 % success rate series 100 consecutive patient treat 3 7 injection 4 % ethanol solution average follow-up 13 month . Fanucci Masala report 90 % success rate 10 month follow-up 3 7 injection 30 % alcohol consecutive series 40 patient . However , none study perform randomize , double blind fashion adequate control . Therefore , scientifically valid conclusion concern treatment efficacy make . The propose study investigate alcohol sclerosing therapy treatment Morton ’ neuroma randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial . The primary end point evaluation patient physical function accord standardize SF-36 questionnaire treatment period . Secondary end point include evaluation pain satisfaction level treatment use , respectively , standardize novel questionnaire .</detailed_description>
