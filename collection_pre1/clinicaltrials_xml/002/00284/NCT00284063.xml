	<brief_title>Z-Joint Changes Low Back Pain Following Adjusting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose continuation project use MRI evaluate gap zygapophysial ( Z ) joint follow side-posture position side-posture spinal adjusting subject acute low back pain ( LBP ) . A fundamental hypothesis one beneficial effect chiropractic spinal adjusting adhesion , develop Z joint follow hypomobility structure , think alleviate separation ( gap ) Z joint spinal adjusting . In previous study , side-posture adjusting find gap Z joint healthy subject . The aim study determine difference measure L4/L5 L5/S1 Z joint space side-posture position lumbar side-posture spinal adjust 112 subject acute LBP , determine amount gap relate pain relief improve function . Before treatment begin , subject temporarily randomize one 4 MRI group : 1 ) neutral positioning , follow side-posture positioning ( painful side ) ; 2 ) neutral positioning , follow side-posture adjusting ( painful side ) , follow neutral positioning ; 3 ) neutral positioning , follow side-posture adjusting ( painful side ) remain side-posture ; 4 ) ( pure control group ) neutral positioning , follow brief side-posture positioning , follow neutral positioning . MRI scan take subject original neutral position final position . Both MRI scan conduct consecutively approximately 30 minute ( 12:19 minute per scan ) . All spinal adjustment give appointment perform directly MRI gantry table first scan . A second MRI appointment occur 2 week later , 2 week treatment . At second MRI appointment , subject assign MRI group opposite one randomize first MRI appointment . Three observer , blind subject grouping , make anterior-to-posterior measurement ( A-P gap ) Z joint directly MRI scan . The gap difference second first scan MRI appointment analyze determine difference exist 4 group . Results first second MRI appointment also evaluate determine amount gap relate pain ( first MRI appointment ) , relief pain ( second MRI appointment - difference Visual Analog Scale initial exam MRI appointment ) current ( first MRI appointment ) change disability ( second MRI appointment - difference Bournemouth Questionnaire score ) . The result study used increase understand mechanism action lumbar side posture adjust side-posture position acute LBP patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Twentyone 69 year age ( 21 year ensure fully develop Z joint &lt; 70 year tolerate side posture MRI scan ) Females equal less 160 pound ; male equal less 200 pound . Hip width measurement equal less 36cm . ( ensure optimum MR image quality ) Pain relate low back ( low lumbar region , L4/L5 and/or L5/S1 region criterion determine examine physician subjective complaint description , well objectively , use inspection , palpation , motion assessment , standard orthopedic neurologic test No history LBP last two week , 3 episode brief back pain ( 1 2 week ) past year . Presence lumbar scoliosis great 5 degree ( Cobb 's angle ) ( due difficulty image Z joint ) Presence radiculopathy ( This criterion evaluate examine physician use patient history , standard screening test , result detail orthopedic/neurologic evaluation ) . No pain relate L4/L5 and/or L5/S1 region ( This criterion determine examine physician subjective complaint description , well objectively use inspection , palpation , motion assessment , standard orthopedic test , Kemp 's , Milgram 's , Yeoman 's , straight leg raise , Valsalva maneuver . ) Pregnancy currently breast feeding ( MRI , even though know risk , event xray need screen contraindication manipulation ) Intolerance MRI procedure ( include claustrophobia inability lie one 's side 15 minute ) . This criterion also evaluate time throughout first two week subject 's care . Claustrophobia also evaluate first second MRI scan . Significant pathology discover MRI scan . This criterion evaluate first MRI visit , immediately first MRI scan take . ( Such pathology constitute contraindication chiropractic adjusting . ) Absence acute low back pain</criteria>
