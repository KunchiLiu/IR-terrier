	<brief_summary>Patients undergo open wedge high tibial osteotomy ( HTO ) randomize standard locking screw fixation osteotomy plate . Tantalum bead implant around osteotomy site subject facilitate RSA image allow micromotion osteotomy site quantify . Primary Objectives Hypothesis 1. ) determine fixation stability Puddu opening wedge osteotomy plate secure non-locking compare locking screw . We hypothesize plate fixation lock screw result significant reduction micromotion tibial segment prior bony heal compare non-locking screw fixation . b ) To determine progress bony heal . We hypothesize increased fixation stability patient lock screws facilitate early bone healing reflect small micromotion time compare non-locking screw patient . 2. ) If improve stability use lock screw , rehabilitation protocol follow open wedge HTO modify accordingly . We hypothesize decrease micromotion reach detection limit RSA setup ( 0.4 mm ) earlier lock screw group non-locking screw group . b ) To evaluate effect osteotomy proximal tibial anatomy . We hypothesize open-wedge procedure might increase rather decrease tibial slope .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For pilot study , total 24 patient schedule open wedge HTO meet inclusion criterion , read study letter information sign informed consent randomize osteotomy plate fixation either non-locking screw ( 12 subject ) lock screw ( 12 subject ) . See flow chart 1 . Pre-operative Assessment All subject undergo routine pre-operative assessment open wedge high tibial osteotomy include : - Documentation demographic data medical history - Subjective assessment knee function use Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) ( 11 ) - Standard physical evaluation lower limb assess range motion , alignment , knee-related sign symptom - Radiographs : standing anteroposterior hip-to-ankle ; ( 2 ) lateral view ; skyline patellar view 30° knee flexion ; bilateral weight-bearing posteroanterior ( PA ) tunnel view 45° knee flexion - Radiographic classification arthrosis use Kellgren scale ( 4 ) - Measurements mechanical anatomical ax low limb calculation propose correction angle Surgery In operating room subject undergo follow step . - Induction general anaesthesia - Percutaenous insertion proximal tibia surround propose osteotomy site fluoroscopic guidance 6 9 radio-opaque 0.8mm tantalum bead use specifically design gun . A standardized pattern widespread tantalum bead distribution use . To avoid bead loosening cause postoperative bone resorption , place distance least 0.5 cm osteotomy line . - RSA image evaluate bead position - Standard opening wedge HTO variable lock non-locking screw fixation Puddu plate accord randomization schedule . This procedure routinely carry fluoroscopic radiographic control - Second RSA image obtain reference film ass stability - Standard wound closure application hinge brace Postoperative Treatment All subject undergo routine opening wedge HTO post-operative rehabilitation protocol . Follow-up Visits The time , number content follow-up visit study subject differ standard post-operative visit schedule patient undergone HTO . However , RSA image specialize , do LHSC University Campus rather Fowler Kennedy Sport Medicine Clinic ( FKSMC ) . This communicated patient letter information . Study follow-up visit 2 , 6,12 week , 6 month surgery . At study follow-up visit subject undergo : - A subjective assessment knee function use KOOS - A standard physical evaluation lower limb assess range motion , alignment , knee-related sign symptom - Radiographs : standing anteroposterior hip-to-ankle - RSA image AP lateral plane simultaneously Radiographs follow-up visit evaluate classification arthrosis use Kellgren scale ( 4 ) measurement mechanical anatomical ax low limb calculation correction angle obtain HTO . Translations tibial segment calculate previously describe RSA image</detailed_description>
