	<brief_summary>It remain unknown concomitant arthroscopic knee debridement would increase benefit surgery ( quality life functional ability ) young active patient medial compartment OA knee varus alignmen . This additional procedure low incidence morbidity would potentially allow treatment meniscal tear articular damage , well joint lavage remove debris inflammatory factor . A trial need determine whether HTO concomitant knee arthroscopy result well overall outcomes patient group.The objective compare quality life , functional status , pain , swell patient undergo HTO without concomitant knee joint arthroscopy address additional joint pathology</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Arthroscopy degenerative condition knee among widely employ orthopaedic procedure , effectiveness ( like effectiveness many surgical operation ) never proven prospective trial . The evidence support use arthroscopy treatment algorithms knee OA come largely case series cohort study . These study show 50 % patient report pain relief following procedure . Predictors poor outcome follow arthroscopy include mark mal-alignment , restricted range motion , advance radiographic change , prior surgery . Improved outcomes predicted preoperative mechanical symptom cause loose body , meniscal tear , radiographic evidence mild articular degeneration . The propose study randomize clinical trial . Each patient undergo preoperative MRI affect knee joint identify exist pathology ( e.g . meniscal tear , loose body , chondral flap ) . The result MRI reveal physician , patient data collector . This ensure information exist joint pathology within group prognostic variable group sufficiently balance ( i.e . comparable rate similar pathology per group ) . The primary outcome measure self-reported quality life ( WOMAC ) . Secondary measure include self-reported functional ability ( LEFS ) , swell , pain frequency analgesic use ( patient diary ) , general health ( SF-36 ) . Assessments take place preoperatively 3 , 6 12 month postoperatively .</detailed_description>
