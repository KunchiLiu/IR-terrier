	<brief_title>Alteplase Percutaneous Treatment Loculated Abdominopelvic Abscesses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use fibrinolytics percutaneous drainage loculated pleural effusion show reduce catheter dwell time improve drainage effusion . Abscesses abdomen pelvis often loculated make percutaneous drainage difficult . We hypothesize infusion alteplase via drainage catheter loculated abscess collection abdomen pelvis similarly decrease catheter dwell time improve overall abscess drainage . The direct injection Activase abscess cavity utilize low dose drug within closed environment associate significant risk hemorrhage . To date , appear significant risk systemic hemorrhagic complication associate use intracavitary thrombolytic drainage abdominopelvic abscess although study report . We hope prove use alteplase intracavitary thrombolysis improve outcomes associate percutaneous catheter drainage loculated abscess collection without increase complication cost . The design trial single-center , prospective , open-label , randomized trial compare infusion Activase versus saline treatment loculated abdominopelvic abscess require percutaneous drainage . Patients loculated abdominopelvic abscess refer percutaneous drainage eligible study . Patients undergo standard placement 10-12 french percutaneous drain abscess cavity compute tomography guidance . If entire content abscess cavity aspirate time initial catheter placement , abscess assume loculated . The patient randomize abscess catheter irrigate twice day volume fluid approximately equal one-half residual volume abscess . In control group , normal saline fluid instill abscess cavity . The study group receive Activase reconstitute sterile water dilute appropriate volume normal saline .</detailed_description>
