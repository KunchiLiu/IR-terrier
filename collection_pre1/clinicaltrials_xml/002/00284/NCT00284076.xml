	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Peripheral arterial disease common disorder effect 15 % men age 55 woman age 65 . Patients peripheral arterial disease increase risk stroke , myocardial infarction adverse vascular outcome . Therapy disorder currently limit 2 FDA approve drug ( Pentoxifylline , cilostazol ) . These agent improve walk distance 10 40 percent . Other agent verapamil prostacyclin analog significant side effect . Although therapy angiogenesis inducer , include injection plasmid construct vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGF protein , beneficial , widespread applicability therapy questionable . The study use alternative approach , may safer effective . The basis approach ability L-arginine enhance endogenous vascular nitric oxide production , improve blood flow acutely . Furthermore , since several angiogenic growth factor may act least partially production nitric oxide , therapy could produce sustained benefit induction increase skeletal muscle capillary density . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized placebo-controlled trial ass effect L-arginine functional status perform patient peripheral arterial disease . Blood flow assess Doppler plethysmography measure nitric oxide synthesis ( plasma urinary nitrogen oxide ) perform . The effect L-arginine treadmill walk distance determine . The potential L-arginine induced angiogenesis assess use magnetic resonance angiography . There two separate study oral L-arginine . The first dose range study involve 80 patient receive four different dos L-arginine ( 9 gram , 6 gram , 3 gram , 0 gram ) . The dose L-arginine perform randomize placebo-controlled fashion . Patients receive six week therapy . Patients diabetic retinopathy , active malignancy previous malignancy state remission , autoimmune disorder exclude . Ophthalmological exam perform screen pathological angiogenesis retina . After completion dose response study , investigator study safety efficacy prolong ( 12 month ) L-arginine therapy . The primary end point absolute claudication distance ( ACD ) statistical analysis perform logarithm ACDT / ACDB . A treadmill perform one month cessation therapy determine structural alteration index limb hemodynamics include ankle brachial index ( ABI ) plethysmography perform 6 12 month therapy 1 month sensation therapy . The study correlate measure limb blood flow evidence increase nitric oxide synthesis measure urinary nitrogen oxide . Flow mediate vasodilation ( FMVD ) brachial artery measure . The choice monitoring flow mediate vasodilation brachial artery , appropriate show systemic enhancement nitric oxide synthesis , would directly support improvement endothelial function vascular bed interest . Asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) measure prediction patient elevate ADMA level , depress urinary nitrogen oxide reduce FMVD might responsive L-arginine therapy . A second aim protocol determine chronic enhancement nitric oxide synthesis L-arginine supplementation endure effect conduit vessel structure . The ankle brachial index , plethysmography , MR perfusion image perform 0 , 6 12 month therapy , 1 month cessation therapy .</detailed_description>
