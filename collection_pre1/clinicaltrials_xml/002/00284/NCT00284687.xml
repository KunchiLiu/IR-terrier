	<brief_summary>Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) remain major cause morbidity mortality follow allogeneic bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . The reliable virological predictive marker disease development presence HCMV viremia . It recognize viral load , viral load kinetics important determinant pathogenesis . Prior preventive use antiviral agent , CMV disease occur 15-45 % at-risk patient carry high mortality rate . In last decade , major advance prevention CMV disease occur application pp65 antigenemia qualitative/quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay rapid sensitive diagnosis HCMV infection , combine preemptive antiviral treatment target patient viremia . The prevalence early CMV disease decline 3 % 6 % intense antiviral drug use . All antiviral drug currently use treatment systemic HCMV infection , include ganciclovir , foscarnet , cidofovir , target HCMV DNA polymerase . Ganciclovir widely use drug preemptive treatment . However , ganciclovir treatment often complicate bone marrow toxicity occasional development potentially life-threatening thrombocytopenia , granulocytopenia , graft failure , associate secondary bacterial fungal infection . Another limitation preemptive ganciclovir therapy requirement intravenous administration . The currently available oral valganciclovir yet approve preemptive therapy SCT recipient , associate high treatment cost . Additionally , prolong repeat ganciclovir treatment may lead development drug resistance . The use foscarnet cidofovir limit considerable nephrotoxicity , low oral bioavailability , high cost . Thus , increase need new effective non-toxic , low-cost anti-HCMV drug high oral bioavailability . Recently , anti-malaria drug artesunate , widely use treatment severe malaria , show highly effective inhibitor HCMV vitro . Artesunate exhibit similar antiviral activity ( micromolar range ) ganciclovir , demonstrate cytotoxicity . Importantly , antiviral activity demonstrate vivo rat CMV model . No significant side effect demonstrate number pre-clinical clinical study , artemisinin derivative show well-tolerated safe adult child . Several million people take artemisinins date , significant adverse treatment-limiting effect report . Although neurotoxicity report supraphysiological dos animal , document human . Meta-analyses malaria patient treat artemisinins demonstrate drug class safe . In rare case , however , slight change haematology value see , include reduction number reticulocytes well slight increase transaminase level . These sign , however , generally give rise noticeable clinical manifestation . In rare case , slight transient reduction sinus heart rate observe . Abdominal cramp mild diarrhoea report elevated dos . Thus , one might expect similarly high degree safety potential use artesunate antiviral drug HCMV infection . Thus , oral therapy artesunate could beneficial option current therapy preemptive treatment HCMV disease SCT recipient .</brief_summary>
