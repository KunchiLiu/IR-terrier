	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy safety aflibercept treatment participant advance chemoresistant non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma ( NSCLA ) . Primary objective : - To determine overall objective response rate ( ORR ) AVE0005 ( ziv-aflibercept , aflibercept , VEGF trap , ZALTRAP® ) 4.0 mg/kg intravenously ( IV ) every 2 week participant platinum- erlotinib-resistant , locally advanced metastatic NSCLA . Secondary objective : - To assess duration response ( DR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) participant population - To evaluate safety profile IV AVE0005 ( ziv-aflibercept , aflibercept , VEGF trap , ZALTRAP® ) . This study employ Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) radiological tumor assessment . For tumor assessment-related efficacy variable , two analysis perform : primary analysis base Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) review data secondary analysis base Investigator evaluation . In addition , Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( mRECIST ) use assess tumor . Where RECIST criterion consider long diameter tumor calculation pertain change tumor size , mRECIST assessment also account difference cavity lesion observe non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Responses base RECIST mRECIST report .</brief_summary>
