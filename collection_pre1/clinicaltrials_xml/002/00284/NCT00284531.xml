	<brief_summary>This protocol design obtain information drug level , metabolism , safety daclizumab ( Zenapax ( R ) ) child adolescent undergo cardiac transplantation . In addition drug safety metabolism information , number severity rejection episodes patient undergo cardiac transplantation use standard immunosuppressive drug plus daclizumab compare patient previously undergone cardiac transplantation Baylor College Medicine receive standard immunosuppressive drug without daclizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Daclizumab Prevention Allograft Rejection Pediatric Heart Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial study renal recent study adult cardiac transplant patient show Zenapax ( R ) efficacious safe use several different dose schedule . Little data available regard pharmacokinetics , safety appropriate dose pediatric heart transplant patient . Yet ever-increasing group patient present significant challenge prevention primary rejection appropriate maintenance immunosuppression . Induction long term allograft acceptance peripheral tolerance show animal model easily induce young animal . Once establish however , allograft rejection immunologic response young quite vigorous . This dichotomy make young allograft recipient particularly attractive population study immune modulators target prevent proliferative expansion alloreactive T cell clone . This precisely mode action anti-IL2R monoclonal reagent Zenapax ( R ) . Although pharmacokinetic data generate adult heart transplant patient multidrug immunosuppressive regimen include Zenapax ( R ) mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , detailed pharmacokinetic data combination multidrug immunosuppressive regimen available pediatric heart transplant subject . Objectives : - Determination pharmacokinetics Zenapax ( R ) pediatric patient receive uniform multidrug immunosuppressive regimen primary induction . - Determine whether unusual drug interaction peculiar pediatric population would require dose modification . Secondary objective : - Investigate long term effect Zenapax ( R ) contain induction regimen pediatric patient .</detailed_description>
