	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Prochymal Salvage Treatment-Refractory Acute GVHD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation ( HCT ) use treatment variety hematological , myeloproliferative lymphoproliferative disorder , malignancy involve solid tumor . Patients receive HCT develop life threaten condition call graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . GVHD occur donor T cell donor bone marrow recognize host cell `` foreign '' initiate inflammatory immunological response . The standard care treatment acute GVHD consist intravenous delivery methylprednisolone start day 1 continuation either cyclosporine tacrolimus . This regimen steroid immunosuppressive drug may relieve symptom GVHD , patient refractory current standard care treatment . For treatment-refractory patient grade III-IV GVHD mortality approximately 80 % . A therapy could effectively suppress immunological response GVHD help repair damage tissue could significantly decrease mortality rate disease .</detailed_description>
