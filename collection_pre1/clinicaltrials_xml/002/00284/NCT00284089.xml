	<detailed_description>The safety tolerability single intravitreal injection ranibizumab evaluated patient enrol single dose phase ( Group A ) . Patients successfully complete single dose phase ( i.e . experience grade-3 targeted adverse event ) could enter multiple dose phase receive ranibizumab injection additional 11 month . Simultaneously , multiple dose phase initiate two parallel dose group additional patient ( Group B ) , receive ranibizumab injection 12 month . After patient Group A Group B complete multiple dose phase , patient provide write consent consider eligible base inclusion exclusion criterion extension phase opportunity continue study treatment individualize flexible treatment regimen guide monthly acuity score ophthalmic examination approval ranibizumab Japan .</detailed_description>
