	<detailed_description>This study prospective multi-center , randomize , double-blind , active-controlled parallel-group , dose range study 5 treatment group ( AVE7688 4 different dosage , losartan-potassium 100 mg ) . There 3 study phase : placebo lead-in , treatment , follow-up . During placebo lead-in phase ( duration 3 4 week ) , patient discontinue concomitant treatment antihypertensive vasodilating agent receive single-blind placebo randomization . Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion randomize receive once-daily oral dos either 2.5 , 10 , 35 50 mg AVE7688 , 100 mg losartan-potassium . The treatment phase consist two part : efficacy evaluation period , 2 week titration period ( randomization week 2 , visit T1 visit T3 ) 12 week , follow long-term safety evaluation period end week 52 . Antihypertensive treatment diuretic , beta blocker calcium channel blocker introduce re-introduced indicated long term safety evaluation period angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACE-I ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) permit . An additional visit ( visit F1 ) occur two week last dose study medication .</detailed_description>
