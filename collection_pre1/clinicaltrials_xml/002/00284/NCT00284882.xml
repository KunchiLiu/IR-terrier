	<brief_summary>The purpose study find often group A Streptococcus ( GAS ) occur school-age child Central Fiji . This bacterium often cause pharyngitis ( sore throat ) also cause pyoderma ( skin infection ) scabies . Approximately 1000 child age 5-14 year enrol 4 primary school Central Fiji . These child throat swab perform determine commonly GAS occurs . Over next 10 month , child group complain sore throat examine throat swab determine GAS cause . A subset 600 child examine pyoderma scabies throat swabs every 2 month 10 month study . In addition , small amount blood drawn 0 , 6 , 10 month determine level antibody Streptococcus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study third part series 5 study include DMID protocols 05-0081 , 05-0082 , 05-0118 , 06-0081 . The primary objective prospective cohort study estimate incidence group A streptococcal ( GAS ) pharyngitis 1000 primary school age school child Fiji ass titer anti-J8 antibody correlate titer antibody GAS infection 600 primary school age child Fiji . Secondary objective : estimate point prevalence GAS pyoderma 600 primary school age child Fiji ; estimate point prevalence scabies 600 primary school age child Fiji ; determine pharyngeal carriage rate group A streptococci 1000 primary school age child Fiji ; describe clinical feature GAS pharyngitis 1000 primary school age child Fiji ; determine upper limit normal value streptococcal serology ( antistreptinolysin O anti-DNase B ) ; genotypically characterize group A streptococci isolate throat swab primary school age child pharyngitis ; genotypically characterize group A streptococci isolated skin swab pyoderma lesion school age child Fiji ; determine antimicrobial susceptibility penicillin , clindamycin , erythromycin chloramphenicol 150 GAS isolates skin swab 150 GAS isolates throat swab . Approximately 1000 school child age 5 -14 4 primary school enrol study approximately 600 1000 school child age 5-14 3 school substudy . Children main study participate 1-2 day , child substudy participate 10-month period . All child start study swab take determine pharyngeal carriage rate GAS . Over next 10 month school child examine pharyngitis complain sore throat throat swab take prove GAS etiology clinical pharyngitis . In subset 600 child , serum take 0 , 6 10 month . Skin examine pyoderma scabies swab take pyoderma lesion every 2 month 10 month . Streptococcal serology , antistreptolysin O titer ( ASOT ) anti-deoxyribonuclease B ( anti-DNase B ) measure 0 month establish upper limit normal value 6 month compare across season . Anti-J8 antibody measure 0 , 6 10 month correlate clinical disease acquisition GAS isolate . All GAS isolates skin throat swab undergo genetic sequence N-terminal C-repeat region ( J8 epitope ) M protein QIMR . One hundred fifty skin swab 150 throat swab undergo antimicrobial susceptibility test penicillin , erythromycin , clindamycin chloramphenicol . The primary endpoint study incidence culture confirm GAS pharyngitis 1000 child 10 month anti-J8 titer correlate case pharyngitis pyoderma 600 child . The secondary endpoint study : number case pyoderma 0,2,4,6,8,10 month ; number case scabies 0,2,4,6,8,10 month ; frequency GAS isolation throat swab 1000 asymptomatic child ; proportion child pharyngitis clinical feature suggestive GAS pharyngitis ; measurement ASOT anti-DNase B titres 600 child - upper limit normal define 80 % ; number GAS isolate throat swab contain J8 epitope , overall emm-type distribution GAS isolate ; number GAS isolate skin swab contain J8 epitope , overall emm-type distribution GAS isolate ; antibiograms GAS isolate skin throat penicillin , clindamycin , erythromycin , chloramphenicol .</detailed_description>
