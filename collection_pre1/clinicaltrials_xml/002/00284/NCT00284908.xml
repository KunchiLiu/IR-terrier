	<brief_summary>S-Tenatoprazole-Na ( STU-Na ) , new drug currently clinical development , belong class drug , call proton pump inhibitor ( PPls ) . Some PPIs already commercially available . STU-Na use treatment acid related disease ( gastroduodenal ulcer , erosive ulcerative esophagitis due gastroesophageal reflux disease ) . This study evaluate degree acid suppression different dose STU-Na . The degree acid suppression consider correlated clinical efficacy . In study four dosage STU-Na ( 30 mg , 60 mg , 90 mg , 120 mg ) test volunteer . First , one dosages orally administer five day . Then , nine sixteen day period without study drug administration follow prior administration next dosage , five day . Each volunteer total four study drug administration period . After last study drug intake period 1 , 2 3 pharmacokinetic blood sample do four day . After last study drug intake period 4 pharmacokinetic blood sample do five day . Pharmacokinetic blood sample consist several blood draw pre-determined time period . The pharmacokinetic blood sample measure medication concentration blood pre-defined time point . After last study drug intake period 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , gastric acidity measure 24 hour mean thin tube insert stomach nostril evaluate efficacy different dosages STU-Na .</brief_summary>
