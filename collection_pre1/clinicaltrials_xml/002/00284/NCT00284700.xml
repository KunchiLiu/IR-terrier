	<detailed_description>We propose complementary study : 1 . A prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled field trial two hundred sixty child peri-urban community near Dhaka City propose . 2 . The assessment iron absorption anti-infective therapy 20 child H. Pylori infection iron deficiency anemia 3 . Field trial 1.1 Description study population Children recruit Nandipara , peri-urban community situate 7 mile northeast Dhaka City . This community population 3,500 area approximately 2.5 square mile . Among resident , 70 % male classify day laborer , 20 % rickshaw puller , 5 % carpenter service holder . Fifteen percent woman day laborers 85 % housewife . The average family size 4.5 member . The slum municipal water supply drink cook family live poorly construct house . The great majority house mud wall thatched dry leaf bamboo tin roof . The population less five year age 700 . The prevelance H. pylori infection less five child community 50 % .44 A weekly clinic run International Centre Diarrhoeal Diseases Research , Bangladesh ( ICDDR , B ) minor case illness population since 1986 . All child community initially screen iron deficiency anemia H. pylorus infection . After explanation study test , inform consent obtain parent legal guardian . Demographic information include name , date birth , sex , weight , height , economic status parent , nature feeding , previous medication past 1 month record . Screening iron deficiency anemia 50 µl capillary blood sample obtain fingerstick assess hemoglobin ( Hgb ) concentration . Measurement hemoglobin concentration useful test screening iron deficiency anemia since directly reflect quantity abundant essential iron compound body . Children hemoglobin concentration 110g/l consider anemic . In child low Hgb identify initial screening , diagnosis iron deficiency anemia confirm venepuncture Hgb , serum ferritin concentration , serum transferrin receptor concentration . Haemoglobin concentration transiently depress due inflammation infection , situation indicate pathological anemia . Of biochemical test assess iron status , low SF specific test iron deficiency . The major disadvantage SF readily elevate response infector inflammatory condition . One major advantage sTfR unlike SF , sTfR significantly effect infection inflammatory process . However , sTfR level increase situation increase RBC turnover hemolytic anemia , i.e . thalassemia , etc . A uniform cutoff value &gt; 8.5 mg/l indicates elevate sTfR therefore iron deficiency hemolytic anaemia . Measurement serum transferrin receptor also become promise new test evaluation iron status particularly epidemiological assessment anemia . Performed conjunction serum ferritin measurement , serum transferrin receptor serve distinguish true iron deficiency anemia anemia chronic disease inflammatory disease , therefore , offer major advantage establish true prevalence iron deficiency anemia population study . The combination low hemoglobin , low serum ferritin , elevate serum transferrin receptor diagnostic iron deficiency anemia . The diagnosis iron deficiency make follow criterion meet : transferrin receptor &gt; 8.3 mg/l , serum ferritin concentration &lt; 12ng/ml , hemoglobin concentration ( &lt; 11 gm/dl ) . Screening H. Pylori infect child The anemic child screen H. Pylori infection use urea breath test ( UBT ) consider many reference diagnostic test H. pylorus infection . We recently establish test ICDDR , B.44 In brief procedure follow . Urea Breath Test A breath sample collect base line 13 CO2 vacutainer follow fasting period 2 hr . A volume 100 ml whole milk allow consumed child . Ten min later 40 mg 13 C urea ( 99 % 13C , Tracer Technologies , Boston , Massachusetts ) give dissolve 25 ml water . After administration substrate , breath sample collect duplicate 30 min . Samples collect two-way pediatric mask attach non-return valve vacutainer store shipment University Alabama , measure 13C concentration respiratory CO2 mass spectrometer . The excess baseline express part per thousand ( delta 0/00 ) . A breath test excess baseline 5.00/00 30 min regard positive H. pylorus infection . 1.2 Selection Study child Iron deficiency anemic child weight age &gt; 60 % National Center Health Statistics ( NCHS ) , evidence deficiency disease systemic infection whose parent give informed consent enrol study .
