	<brief_summary>The indication chemotherapy 2nd line treatment advance non small cell lung cancer well establish . The two treatment reference pemetrexed ( alimta ) docetaxel ( taxotere ) . Effectiveness toxicity two drug largely documented literature . Economic analysis currently one criterion use medical decision , beside effectiveness , quality life toxicity . However , Economical comparison show significant variation acquisition cost two drug . Consequently , appear interesting carry randomize prospective study exclusive economical criterion judgment . As difference effectiveness two treatment , cost-minimization analysis carry appreciate ratio benefit/risks economical point view ( payer ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmaco-economic Study Second Line Treatment Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective trial compare , economically , use pemetrexed ( alimta® ) 2nd line chemotherapy advance non-small cell lung cancer versus docetaxel ( taxotere® ) . 150 patient select trial , check eligibility criterion , randomize two arm : - Arm A : Taxotere 75 mg/m² every 3 week . - Arm B : Alimta 500 mg/m² every 3 week . Inclusion assessment . - Clinical sign - Blood cell count , renal hepatic function ( within 8 day ) - Chest X ray , CT scan MRI scan , abdominal echography , and/or abdominal scan ( within 28 day ) - Brain scan , bone scintigraphy and/or bone x ray ( within 28 day ) - Bronchial endoscopy ( within 28 day ) - EKG , echocardiography accord history Follow-up assessment . 1 . At cycle - Clinical sign - Blood cell count D1 , D8 , D15 - Creatinine , serum electrolyte ( K+ , Ca++ ) , SGOT , SGPT , total bilirubin , LDH , alkaline phosphate , total protein albumin , EKG , Chest X-ray D1 2 . Follow-up 2 month till PD 3 . End trial : Complete tumor assessment 4 . Each objective response may confirm 4 week later Length ot study . - Patients arm treat progression toxicity decision stop trial . - Responder patient treat 6 cycle . The follow-up assessment carry 2 month . Response assessment . According RECIST criterion . Resource consumption . 1 . Recording volume : - All medication quantity record mg . The chemotherapeutic product record mg. All concomitant treatment : RHO , anti-emetics , growth factor , antibiotic adverse event treatment notify . - Hospitalizations treatment category ( inpatient , outpatient , home base treatment ) note . - All hospitalization adverse event record ( category ) . Grade 1-2 adverse event notify case report form . Hospitalizations disease complication progression , curative palliative radiation record . 2 . Cost calculation : - All hospitalisation value DRGs day hospitalisation price , accord country . Ambulatory care value appropriate country price . The drug price do pharmaceutical company .</detailed_description>
