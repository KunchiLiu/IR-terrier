	<brief_summary>It known people cancer use antioxidant vitamin high rate . It known vitamin safe use cancer treatment . It known common vitamin mineral use many cancer patient interfere cancer treatment reduce effectiveness cancer therapy . Preliminary study look addition antioxidant cancer therapy show u antioxidant could play significant role management cancer . Antioxidants vitamins nutrient help decrease inflammation body stop free radical oxidant . Common antioxidant include vitamin E , C , A , beta-carotene , glutathione . Some doctor treat cancer use antioxidant chemotherapy others believe use cancer treatment . The purpose study try understand safe efficacious add antioxidant nutritional supplement traditional chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy treatment cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Antioxidants During GYN Cancer Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It known cancer patient use antioxidant great rate healthy peer patient generally tell physician . This use adequately evaluate . This pilot trial Phase II study design assess safety high-dose antioxidant gynecologic malignancy . Secondarily , evaluate efficacy antioxidant use . These goal accomplish monitor adverse event clinical evaluation , metabolic function limit tumor marker , blood count , hepatic , renal enzyme , tumor response rate secondarily . The study conduct University Kansas Medical Center . Oversight partnership establish FDA-CDER , Kansas Masonic Cancer Research Institute , University Kansas Medical Center - IRB . The study open label prospective investigational study 50 gynecologic cancer patient Primary Hypothesis : To assess safety add high-dose antioxidant chemotherapy treatment gynecologic malignancy ( uterine , cervical , epithelial ovarian ) . Qualitative quantitative toxicity assess monitor clinical status National Cancer Institute common toxicity criterion version 3.0 , quality life measure ( FACT-G ) , evaluate metabolic function include limited hepatic renal function . Secondary Hypothesis : To assess efficacy tumor response rate patient gynecologic malignancy treat antioxidant include intravenous oral ascorbic acid , intravenous glutathione , oral mixed carotenoid , mixed tocopherol , vitamin A . Secondary endpoint time progression survival . Patients newly diagnose recurrent gynecologic cancer invite participate subject limited present cervical , uterine , ovarian epithelial origin . Fifty patient enrol . The study subject treat antioxidant add usual oncologic care 12 month . This population choose anecdotal case report evidence benefit high-dose antioxidant add care .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically diagnosed adenocarcinoma and/or sarcoma squamous cell carcinoma gynecologic origin ( uterine , ovary , cervical ) newly diagnose relapse . Tumors ovary restrict epithelial origin . There must evidence advance stage neoplasm and/or patient need chemotherapy metastatic disease . The patient must screen eligibility care approve treating oncologist ; oncology care dictate oncology team . Patients must ambulatory status without evidence active brain metastasis spinal cord compression . ECOG Performance Status 02 . ( Grade 0 = Fully active , able carry predisease activity without restriction Grade 1= Restricted physical strenuous activity ambulatory able carry work light sedentary nature e.g . light housework , office work Grade 2 = Ambulatory capable self care unable carry work activity . Up 50 % waking hour . Laboratory : ANC =1,500/mm3 , Hemoglobin &gt; 8g/dL , platelet = 1000,000/mm3 , total bilirubin = 1.5 mg/dL , creatinine =2.0 mg/dL , transaminase ( AST/ALT ) =2.5X upper limit , urine uric acid &lt; 1,000mg/d , urine pH &lt; 6 , urine oxalate &lt; 60 mg/d . Willingness take oral nutrient answer FACTG QOL questionnaires Patients language barrier , cooperative , give informed consent enter study inform medication procedure use study may participate . G6PD deficient Ovarian tumor : sarcoma , germ cell , atypical cell line epithelial History oxalate renal calculus ; urine oxalate level &gt; 60 mg/d baseline History bleed disorder hemochromatosis Patients undergoing radiation therapy Patients enrol trial currently precede 3 month . Patients evidence significant psychiatric disorder history/examination would prevent completion study allow participate . ECOG Performance Status 34 . ( Grade 3 = Capable limit self care , confine bed chair 50 % waking hour . Grade 4 = Completely disable . Can carry self care . Totally confined bed chair . ) Comorbid condition would affect survival : end stage congestive heart failure , unstable angina , myocardial infarction within 6 week study , uncontrolled blood sugar = 300 mg/dL , patient know chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis . Patients consume excess alcohol abuse drug ( excess alcohol define four one follow per day : 30mL distilled spirit , 340mL beer , 120mL wine ) allow . Patients smoke tobacco product allow participate . Of note , patient continue begin smoke allow continue protocol unable achieve elevation plasma vitamin C level desire 400 mg/dL . ( Unless 400 mg/dL plasma level achieve , ( presume ) chemotherapeutic action highdose intravenous ascorbate ) . The inability achieve desire plasma level ascorbate presumably relate increase oxidative stress smoking . Patients clearly make aware possibility come protocol smoke . We monitor cotinine level ( nicotine metabolite ) suspect smoker . Patients unwilling take oral antioxidant allow participate .</criteria>
