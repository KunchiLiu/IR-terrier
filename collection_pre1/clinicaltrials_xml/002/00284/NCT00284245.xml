	<brief_summary>In early work , Sponsor develop computer image processing system analysis pain diagrams patient chronic pain . This system test study 500 chronic pain patient see primary care practitioner pain specialist . The hypothesis pain location would correlate pain type underlie cause pain . In study , computer analysis demonstrate clear correlation pain diagram data diagnosis/pain type . The present study extend observation web-based setting , focus value computer analysis pain diagram diagnostic predictor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Earlier work perform Sponsor ( TMT ) include development MatLab/ImageJ computer image processing system generation composite image pain diagram draw patient pain , calculation relate quantitative variable . The system test pharmaceutical company-sponsored US study 500 chronic pain patient see primary care practitioner , see pain specialist . The hypothesis pain location would correlate pain type underlie cause pain . TMT 's analysis establish correlation pain diagram information underlie diagnosis pain type ( e.g. , nociceptive neuropathic ) report pain specialist . The present study extend observation web-based setting , particular emphasis automate computer-generated visual pain pattern diagnostic predictor .</detailed_description>
