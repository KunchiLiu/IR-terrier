	<brief_summary>Treatment growth hormone ( GH ; hormone make body stimulates growth ) show helpful treat child chronic kidney disease fail grow . The amount growth see child treat growth hormone vary widely unknown reason . Growth hormone work produce another hormone liver call insulin-like growth factor-1 , IGF-1 short . IGF-1 stimulates bone grow . The amount IGF-1 blood may directly affect amount growth child . At time , growth hormone therapy child depend give certain dose growth hormone child base weight . If 3-6 month dose growth hormone change height enough , dose growth hormone increase enough growth see . This method dose growth hormone may take long time complicate time-consuming . The purpose study measure amount IGF-1 produce body result give 2 different dos growth hormone child 7 day . The study investigator hop find favorable level IGF-1 generate 7 day growth hormone correlate good growth child kidney disease . Then instead dose growth hormone weight , like do , researcher dose growth hormone amount IGF-1 body produce . Being able dose effectively save valuable time child grow shorten overall duration growth hormone therapy . The investigator also determine effect inflammatory cytokine Il-6 TNF-alpha growth hormone insensitivity hence IGF-1 generation test population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Optimize Growth Hormone Dosing Children With Chronic Kidney Disease Measuring IGF-1 Levels Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study involve 30 child chronic kidney disease failure grow . The study last 14 month . There screen clinic visit child qualifies study , Week -8 . Each clinic visit include , get medical history , physical exam , blood test . Also x-ray wrist calculate bone age . If abnormal blood value find result kidney failure attempt make correct next 2 month enrollment study . Also child ask keep track food 3 day every month study . A study nutritionist call month go food diary . At study Week -4 , child come clinic visit . Then Week 0 study , decision make randomly base level kidney function dose growth hormone child receive . This either low dose growth hormone high dose growth hormone . At Week 1 Week 4 visit , child come clinic visit . Children take growth hormone ( needle skin ) every night full 7 day two week . In morning 1st 7th dose week , child blood draw check IGF-1 level . During Weeks 2 3 , child take growth hormone order allow body clear , `` wash-out '' , medication system Week 4 . At Week 5 , child begin take growth hormone evening continue every day Week 28 . Then , Weeks 29 30 , child another `` wash-out '' period growth hormone treatment . At Week 31 , blood drawn morning 1st 7th dose growth hormone treatment . From Week 32 , child take growth hormone every evening continue Week 56 , end study . Also week 1 , skin fold measurement ass body fat do subject . A DEXA scan , test measure body fat muscle mass do old child study optional basis Weeks 1 , 28 56 . Another wrist X-ray bone age repeat 56 week study .</detailed_description>
