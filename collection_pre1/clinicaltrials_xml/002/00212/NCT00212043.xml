The questionnaire may fill patient he/she able read understand language questionnaire . Otherwise , name person administer QoL read question write , language patient understands , record response question without prejudice his/her answer . The mode delivery note questionnaire . 11 . RANDOMISATION PROCEDURE Study participant randomly assign receive either gemcitabine give conventional 30 minute infusion , protract infusion , combination carboplatin . 11.1 Stratification Stratified randomization carry use minimization method base follow factor : ( ) Centre ( National University Hospital , Sydney Cancer Centre , Johns Hopkins-NUH International Medical Centre ) ( ii ) Karnofsky performance status ( 90 - 100 % v 70 - 80 % ) ( iii ) Stage disease ( IIIB v IV ) 11.2 Registration Patients enter trial telephone call National Medical Research Council ( NMRC ) Clinical Trials &amp; Epidemiology Research Unit ( CTERU ) , Singapore ( +65 220-1292 ) 0830 1730 hour Monday Friday , 0830 1230 hour Saturday ( Singapore time ) , Fax ( +65 220-1485 ) , state patient enter CTRG L08 SQLU02 trial . Informed write consent entry study obtain prior randomization . All eligibility criterion consent form check , stratification factor state treatment allocate . The patient randomize long infusional gemcitabine ( L ) 30- minute short infusion gemcitabine ( S ) , allocate trial number . The design involve equal allocation patient two treatment . Confirmation fax send investigator . 12 . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The sample size calculation carry base statistical selection theory criterion detail Simon et al ( 62 ) Gibbons et al ( 63 ) . Assuming 90 % probability correctly select best treatment , anticipate baseline response rate 40 % , detect 15 % superiority best treatment , trial size 37 patient per treatment arm would require . The total accrual target would thus 74 patient . 13 . STATISTICAL ANALYSES Statistical analysis study endpoint carry intention-to-treat basis . In event lose follow-up , patient still include analysis duration observe . The inherent comparability result randomize phase II design use statistical selection theory assure two treatment reliably rank large difference obtain . The best response use analysis objective tumour response . In case adverse event , multiple event kind occur patient , maximum grade document analysis . The tumour response rate toxicities treatment group compare descriptively use estimate proportion . The response duration time response respond patient assess use appropriate descriptive statistic . The evaluation progression-free overall survival carry use Kaplan-Meier technique 1-year follow-up . In case progression-free survival , patient whose disease progress censor date last known alive . Similarly , analysis overall survival censor patient lose follow-up remained alive date last known alive . For QoL dimension , change score time compare treatment arm mean appropriate graphical representation descriptive statistic . No interim analysis plan randomise phase II trial . 14 .
