	<detailed_description>Enterocutaneous fistula abnormal connection bowel skin bowel content pass . Their management present considerable medical surgical challenge . Since 1970s mainstray treatment supportive initiation `` nil mouth '' regimen intravenous ( parenteral ) nutrition aim stabilise patient induce gastrointestinal tract rest . There seem unquestioned benefit attribute total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) 1970s 1980s carried current day . This rigid approach management enterocutaneous fistula almost universal yet extensive literature search suggest mixed result clinical trial mixed opinion expert field . A large study publish late 1970s ( Souters et al . 1979 ) demonstrate 44 % mortality patient enterocutaneous fistula 1946 1959 fell 15 % 1960 1970 introduction improve parasurgical care ; 1970 decrease mortality rate observe despite introduction parenteral nutrition . It could therefore argue parenteral nutrition offer real additional benefit patient . Surprisingly information literature compare enteral nutrition parenteral nutrition patient enterocutaneous fistula . Enter nutrition physiological , associate few complication cheap compare parenteral nutrition . If parenteral nutrition show offer benefit regard fistula closure patient enterocutaneous fistula enteral feeding would nutritional modality choice . This would constitute major shift current management patient . Recent research show supply nutrient line gastrointestinal tract significant effect growth cell line gut motility whole . Many effect mediate intestinal growth factor glucagon-like peptide-2 ( GLP-2 ) gut hormone cholecystokinin ( CCK ) peptide YY ( YYY . Although study perform look level growth factor gut hormone patient enterocutaneous fistula , seem theoretically likely route nutrition patient effect level intestinal growth factor gut hormone . This turn may effect fistula heal fistula output . Modulation level growth factor gut hormone may provide new therapeutic option future management enterocutaneous fistula .</detailed_description>
