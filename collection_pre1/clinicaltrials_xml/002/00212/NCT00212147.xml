	<brief_summary>Low cobalamin ( vitamin B12 ) level frequent elderly . Most often reflect mild metabolic abnormality without clinical symptom ( subclinical cobalamin deficiency ) . It unclear elderly people require medical intervention , unlike small minority clinical symptom progress create severe blood nervous system problem . The study aim determine nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , common anesthetic agent , worsen cobalamin status elderly patient unrecognized subclinical cobalamin deficiency . The reason concern N2O inactivate cobalamin aggravate clinical picture patient already clinical manifestation cobalamin deficiency . The elderly known increase risk develop mental change surgery may sometimes result aggravation subclinical cobalamin deficiency . The study recruit people age 60 year undergo clinically indicate elective surgery require general anesthesia 1 hour . Patients meet exclusion inclusion criterion randomize receive either standard anesthetic regimen include N2O nearly identical one without N2O . Before surgery 2 week 4 week surgery , patient undergoes ( 1 ) broad battery test cognition mood ( 2 ) blood test measure cobalamin , folate homocysteine-methionine metabolism determine whether subtle biochemical impairment cobalamin status . DNA blood cell also test presence common mutation affect key enzyme metabolic pathway . A brief test postoperative delirium also do 2 hour surgery . The patient subgroup ' analyze neuropsychologic change time , use preoperative test baseline comparison , association change metabolic , genetic , demographic clinical data . The primary question effect routine N2O exposure latter compare non-N2O anesthesia elderly people either subclinical cobalamin deficiency . It help answer whether combination help explain increased risk cognitive problem surgery elderly patient , extension whether preoperative cobalamin test treatment may indicate elderly . It also test whether genetic predisposition affect describe problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : - Double-blind , randomize study elderly patient schedule elective surgery general anesthesia . - Medical , cobalamin-related , demographic information ; - Blood test cobalamin-related metabolic status genotyping 4 relevant mutation ; - Psychoneurologic evaluation surgery ; - Randomization receive standard anesthetic regimen nitrous oxide ( N2O ) regimen without N2O ; - Intraoperative perioperative data collect ; - Testing delirium 2-3 hour surgery . - All preoperative study repeat 2 week 4 week . - Patients abnormal cognitive status persist 4 week receive cobalamin retested 3 month . Inclusion criterion : - Age &gt; 60 year ; - Anticipated duration general anesthesia &gt; 1 hour ; - Good English comprehension . Exclusion criterion : - Surgery involve brain , blood supply head neck , heart ; - Dementia , psychosis brain disease ; - Contraindication N2O use ; - Clinical status ASA class 1 2 ; - Bronchospastic obstructive pulmonary disease ; - N2O exposure past 6 month ; - Cobalamin injection past 6 month ; - RBC mean corpuscular volume &gt; 95 fl ; - Creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dl . - History evidence paresthesia , numbness foot hand , gait balance problem , memory thinking problem . If preoperative cognitive test produce suspicious result ( two unrelated test result &gt; 1.5 x standard deviation normal mean ) , immediate review do decide exclusion patient study . All investigator tester blind N2O exposure ( except anesthesiologist ) cobalamin status . Subject Numbers : Statistical power analysis statistician project need 386 subject achieve power 80 % type I error 0.05 . Based possible 15 % subject loss rate , 444 subject plan . Patient Information questionnaire include : - Demographic information ; - Relevant medical history ; - Cobalamin-related history ; - Exclusion factor . Randomization : - Computer-generated number system ; - Made know surgery anesthesiologist . Anesthetic protocol : - One two effective , commonly use anesthetic regimen protocol ; - Standard ASA monitor , oxygen analyzer carbon dioxide capnograph apply . - General anesthesia induce N2O non-N2O group fentanyl ( 2-5 µg/kg ) propofol ( 1-3 mg/kg ) , allow appropriate titration desire end point without adverse reaction . Cisatracurium ( 0.15 mg/kg ) give muscle relaxation . - Anesthesia maintain either 40 % oxygen/60 % N2O ( N2O study arm ) 40 % oxygen air ( non-N2O arm ) , desflurane study group , titrate depth anesthesia . Fentanyl use group ( 1 µg/kg/hr ) primary narcotic end surgery ; - Following intubation , monitor ventilation maintains normocapnea adequate oxygenation . Temperature , blood pressure , heart rate maintain prescribed standard method . - At end surgery , desflurane N2O ( , study arm , desflurane O2/room air ) stop , residual neuromuscular block pharmacologically antagonize , dolasetron give prophylaxis nausea vomiting , postoperative analgesia provide opioids , need . - The protocol allow clinically indicate modification time . - All assure anesthetic management compromise , allow inclusion N2O ( vs room air ) difference two arm , use agent know affect cobalamin N2O . Intraoperative data collection : - Duration N2O exposure ; - Doses anesthetic ; - Surgery actually perform ; - Oxygen saturation , monitor continuously ; - End-tidal CO2 ; - End-tidal desflurane ; - Blood loss transfusion ; - Temperature emergence anesthesia , minimal temperature ; - Range perioperative blood pressure ; - Presence emergence delirium ; - Adverse postoperative event ; - Medications require postoperatively . Blood Tests Cobalamin Status related test : - Serum cobalamin folate level ; - Homocysteine immunoassay EDTA-anticoagulated plasma separate within 1 hour PI 's laboratory ; - Serum methylmalonic acid ( MMA ) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ; - Plasma metabolite ( methionine , glutathione , S-adenosylmethionine , S-adenosylhomocysteine , cysteine , cysteinylglycine ; see later ) ; - Serum creatinine , complete blood count , blood smear . The diagnosis subclinical cobalamin deficiency make BOTH follow criterion meet : - Two follow 3 abnormality : low cobalamin , high homocysteine , high MMA level . All investigator remain blinded finding , require action . - Clinically apparent cobalamin deficiency rule . This always know investigator surgery , permit immediate exclusion patient study positive . Assay Metabolites Homocysteine Methionine : - Plasma separate within 15 minute venipuncture , keep ice centrifugation , store aliquots -80C . - Unthawed aliquot ship dry ice University Arkansas assay use HPLC coulometric detection . - Because metabolite affect renal status , adjustment creatinine make . - Analyses focus metabolite result relation ( ) ; ( b ) original cobalamin status ; ( c ) folate level ; ( ) N2O exposure , relation original cobalamin status gene polymorphism ; ( e ) presence gene polymorphism ( include combination ) ; ( f ) appearance cognitive dysfunction v none . Longitudinal metabolic change entire follow-up period examine . Gene Polymorphism Analyses : - DNA extract preoperative blood sample , purify DNA store -80C . - The 677C-T 1298A-C mutation MTHFR determine standard technique ; - The methionine synthase 2756A-G ( D919G ) mutation identify use HaeIII , MTRR 66A-G ( I22M ) mutation use NdeI . - Analysis consider homozygous mutation state combine heterozygosity produce impaired enzyme activity , combine mutation different enzyme , well allele frequency . - Study analyse focus question : ( ) Does metabolic clinical N2O effect vary genotype ? ( b ) Do polymorphisms influence appearance subclinical cobalamin deficiency ? ( c ) How metabolite change affect mutation ? Cognitive Function Depression Testing : - Done train tester quiet office free distraction ; - A focused battery neuropsychological test require 1.5 hour administer . - The test ass : - Attention/Concentration : ( ) Paced Serial Addition Test , require active attention rapid information processing ; ( b ) California Computerized Assessment Package measure perfomance sensitive attention decision making . - Cognitive flexibility test Letter-Number Sequencing , subtest Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III . - Memory learning test California Verbal Learning Test-2 . - Depression assess Beck Depression Inventory . All test score within 48 hour review neuropsychologist , blind patient ' status . All measure expect show `` practice ( familiarization ) effect '' 3 administration , appropriate adjustment analysis make . If result test two four test category &gt; 1.5 SD normal mean preoperative assessment , immediate review possible exclusion study do . A decline postoperative test result &gt; 1.5 x SD normal mean previous result 2 individual test also bring attention PI safety monitor decision concern cobalamin treatment . Assessment delirium do 2-3 hour postoperatively Mini-Mental State Examination CAM-ICU test . Potential confounders drug , hypoxia , infection take account analysis . Long-term follow-up beyond 4 week do patient cognitive function ( include depression test ) significantly bad 4 week test preoperatively . A decline test equivalent 1 SD normal mean test use decision benchmark . Data Analysis : - The primary question whether patient subclinical deficiency show neuropsychologic impairment N2O exposure great patient without deficiency . Analysis difference include comparison deficient non-deficient patient assign non-N2O arm . Confounders address adjust relevant variable . - The statistician conduct analyse consult ongoing basis throughout study . Before analysis , continuous variable subject logarithmic transformation . Univariate analysis , follow select multivariate analysis , include duration anesthetic exposure , level preoperative postoperative metabolic deficit , well coexist disorder . Bonferroni adjustment use multiple comparison appropriate . Multiple logitic regression use evaluate significant independent predictor abnormal result . - An interim analysis do 3.5 year , use alpha 0.005 . - Analyses metabolic genetic finding do univariate analysis , follow multivariate analysis determine mutation ' effect . Risks Subjects : - All subject undergo clinically indicate , elective surgery general anesthesia . No aspect surgical management affect participation . The study-related change clinical management random assignment omission inclusion N2O near identical , standard anesthesia regimen . - The manipulation blood sample undergoing neuropsychologic test several day surgery 3-4 occasion postoperatively ( except genetic test , do ) . - Medical information collection relevant study subject confidentiality protection HIPAA-mandated respect . - Cobalamin/N2O related risk actually small participant nonparticipant . Several layer protection small risk associate study include cobalamin-related evaluation otherwise do routinely N2O anesthesia identify patient know risk N2O ; continue postoperative monitoring change cobalamin status significant cognitive decline ; intervention cobalamin therapy possibly affect patient ; institution Data Safety Monitoring plan independent safety monitor ; interim analysis study finding . Safety monitoring : - Preoperative discovery cognitive test dysfunction exclude patient study exposure risk . - A postoperative decline exceed equivalent 1.5 x SD normal mean two unrelated measure cognitive function bring immediate attention PI , collaborate neuropsychologist , independent scientist-clinician part study .</detailed_description>
