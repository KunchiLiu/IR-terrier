	<detailed_description>Discovered 1982 cause gastroduodenal ulceration , Helicobacter pylorus ( Hp ) major cause gastritides ( e.g . chronic-active ) primary duodenal ulcer adult child . [ Warren , 1983 # 1180 ; Whitney , 2000 # 1345 ; Ashorn , 1995 # 1179 ; Asante , 1997 # 1173 ; Drumm , 1987 # 355 ; Czinn , 1986 # 101 ; Drumm , 1988 # 1096 ; Ernst , 2000 # 1351 ; Goggin , 1998 # 986 ; Torres , 2000 # 1346 ] Infection Hp , particularly susceptible person , also strongly link gastric adenocarcinoma cancer mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue-type ( MALT ) lymphoma . [ Uemura , 2001 # 1409 ; Alexander , 2000 # 1232 ; Alm , 1999 # 1038 ; Blaser , 1995 # 757 ; Correa , 1990 # 1523 ; El-Omar , 2000 # 1272 ] The majority infection worldwide acquire childhood . In United States , minority population ( African Americans , Hispanics ) increase seroprevalence rate age group . [ Fontham , 1995 # 139 ; Gold , 2001 # 1422 ; Graham , 1991 # 235 ; Staat , 1996 # 190 ; Smoak , 1994 # 618 ] Consensus guideline pediatric Hp infection first publish 1999 , yet remain overwhelming paucity information regard epidemiology pediatric Hp infection associate disease . [ Gold , 2000 # 1347 ; Drumm , 2000 # 1123 ; Sherman , 1999 # 1129 ; Hunt , 1998 # 353 ] It know Hp-infected child develop symptom , mechanism account difference inflammatory response disease Hp-infected child uncharacterized . Using multicenter study approach test hypothesis , proposal provide depth examination association host factor , Hp strain genotype , severity gastric inflammatory response child . Variation age , race/ethnicity , medical/environmental exposure , socioeconomic status geographic region effect disease phenotype child investigate . These study address unanswered question early stage pathobiology Hp infection essential improve ability manage infection child , potentially , identify understand `` risk group '' prevent severe disease sequela adult . Understanding evolution host response Hp infection need develop prevention strategy new therapy , allow good definition pathobiology human pathogen cause significant morbidity , suffering , economic impact society . In 5 year NIH funding , enrol cohort 486 child 3 site ( Atlanta , Cleveland , Miami ) ; 184 ( 38 % ) Hp-infected . We make novel observation regard environmental exposure , pilot validation symptom assessment instrument , pediatric Hp strain genotype/disease phenotype relationship , disease paradigm previously describe pediatric population ; i.e. , atrophic gastritis intestinal metaplasia associate Hp infection . Overall hypothesis competitive renewal : gastroduodenal disease ( e.g. , duodenal ulcer ) Hp-infected child associate specific host factor ( i.e. , race/ethnicity ) , environmental exposure , infection Hp strain carry specific virulence gene contain within cag pathogenicity island . These combined factor drive either predominant Th2 gastric mucosal response antral predominant severe mucosal inflammation ( i.e. , ulcer disease ) Th1 response result chronic , corpus-predominant inflammatory infiltrate ( i.e. , atrophy ) . Specific aim : Aim 1 : Further characterize specific host factor environmental exposure contribute symptomatic childhood infection emphasize target enrollment patient multiple center specific age , gender demographic stratum facilitate detection significant difference symptomatic asymptomatic Hp-infected child attain previously follow-up 2 establish specific cohort ascertain immune response natural history . Aim 2 : Utilize gene-array technology whole genome assessment bacterial virulence gene specific bacterial gene expression allow characterization virulence protein associate pediatric Hp infection . The Hp isolate prospectively enrol infected child ( case ) Aim 1 , Hp strain obtain follow-up two establish cohort remain infected , well retrospective analysis 125 bank pediatric isolates link clinical , demographic epidemiological data characterize . Specific emphasis analysis isolate find follow three disease category : ulcer , gastritis , atrophic gastritis . Aim 3 : Further characterize gastric mucosal host inflammatory response Hp-infected child . The Updated Sydney system apply assess severity gastric histopathology , immunohistochemistry perform formalin-fixed , paraffin embed tissue phenotype mucosal disease ( i.e. , character , severity ) newly enrol case specific age , gender demographic stratum two `` novel '' cohort establish previous study ; ) atrophic gastritis cohort ; ii ) esophageal gastric disease cohort , afford insight natural history immune response Hp-infected child two different disease paradigm . Both molecular method novel micro ELISPOT perform PBMCS gastric T-cells determine Th1 , Th2 balance Th1/Th2 response use characterize Hp-infected child 's immune phenotype . During latter 2 year propose study , PBMC chemokine response compare mucosal/cellular response use RT-PCR gene array . The data obtain aim 1 3 integrate obtain aim 2 ( Hp-strain genotype ) order develop model predict disease outcome base host demographic , strain type inflammatory/immune response .

	<criteria>Using power determination age , gender demographic characteristic , investigator screen patient undergoing diagnostic upper endoscopy : Children 's Healthcare Atlanta ( Egleston Scottish Rite Children 's Hospitals ) , Atlanta , GA Rainbow Babies Children 's Hospital , Cleveland , OH Miami Children 's Hospital , Miami , FL . Patients enrol first 3 year study , base interim univariate analysis . The investigator also perform followup evaluation ( i.e. , clinicallyindicated ) two novel cohort identify first 5 year funding : atrophic gastritis Hpinfected cohort esophagitis/gastritis cohort , order assess natural history gastroduodenal inflammation Hpinfected child . Patients take antibiotic within one month endoscopy exclude , precede antibiotic therapy confound ability determine Hp infection status . In previous five year , investigator initially eliminate child take proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) ( e.g. , omeprazole ) ; Na+/H+ ATPase channel inhibitor . PPIs minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) Hp vitro , therefore may reduce overall bacterial load , diminish ability detect infection , resolve gastroduodenal mucosal inflammation , confound characterization cellular host response Hp infection . However , due pervasive use PPIs pediatric population , exclusion potential case , investigator improve culture sensitivity technique able successfully detect organism set child PPI . This take account characterize gastric mucosal inflammatory phenotype comparative analysis perform .</criteria>
