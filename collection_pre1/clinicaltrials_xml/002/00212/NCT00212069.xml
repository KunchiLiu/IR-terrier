	<brief_summary>Tumors heterogeneous vary response chemotherapeutic agent . We hypothesize tumor sensitive particular chemotherapeutic agent distinctive tumor protein profile compare resistant . We hypothesize since tumor continuously perfuse serum , serum protein profile use surrogate marker tumor protein profile . The primary objective study identify serum protein profile predict gemcitabine/carboplatin sensitivity resistance breast cancer patient prior exposure anthracyclines taxanes . Secondary objective establish serum protein profile breast cancer patient prior exposure anthracyclines taxanes , study pharmacogenetics gemcitabine toxicity correlate germline genotype transporter drug metabolize enzyme plasma intracellular gemcitabine pharmacokinetics .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Metastatic breast cancer patient previously treat anthracyclines taxanes treat gemcitabine carboplatin every 3 week . Serial plasma sample collect proteomics profile SELDI-MS correlate tumor response identify biomarkers may predict chemotherapy sensitivity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female , age &gt; = 18 year . Histologic cytologic diagnosis breast carcinoma . Stage IV breast cancer prior exposure anthracyclines taxanes , either neoadjuvant , adjuvant metastatic setting . Presence least one unidimensionally measurable , nonCNS indicator lesion define radiologic study physical examination For patient previous radiotherapy , indicator lesion ( ) must within previous radiation field . The last dose radiotherapy least 3 week prior study entry . The total radiotherapy receive 30 % bone marrow . Karnofsky performance status 70 high . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . Adequate organ function include follow : Bone marrow : White blood cell ( WBC ) &gt; = 3.5 x 109/L Absolute neutrophil ( segmented band ) count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1.5 x 109/L Platelets &gt; = 100 x 109/L Haemoglobin &gt; = 9g/dL Hepatic : Bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , ALT AST &lt; = 2.5x ULN , ( &lt; 5 X liver metastasis ) Alkaline phosphatase &lt; = 2.5x ULN . Renal : Creatinine clearance &gt; 30ml/minute , base Cockcroft formula Signed inform consent patient legal representative . Patients reproductive potential must use approved contraceptive method appropriate ( eg , intrauterine device , birth control pill , barrier device ) three month study . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior study enrollment . Treatment within last 30 day investigational drug . Concurrent administration tumor therapy , include cytotoxic chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy . Active infection opinion investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Pregnancy . Breast feeding . Serious concomitant disorder would compromise safety patient compromise patient 's ability complete study , discretion investigator .
