	<brief_title>Docetaxel Combined With Ketoconazole Treatment Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize 70mg docetaxel co-administered ketoconazole would result similar clinical efficacy conventional dos docetaxel ( 75mg/m2 body surface area ) term clinical pathological response rate metastatic breast cancer . We hypothesize tumor genomic proteomic change serum proteomic change would correlate tumor response . We also look correlate drug pharmacokinetics treatment toxicity , genotype drug metabolize enzyme transporter , peripheral mononuclear cell gene expression profile . The primary objective evaluate clinical response rate 70mg docetaxel ketoconazole metastatic breast cancer , evaluate pathological response rate primary tumor follow four cycle docetaxel ketoconazole .</detailed_description>
