	<detailed_description>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) develop anemia due reduce erythropoietin production kidney . Correction anemia show improve exercise capacity , cognition , quality life may slow disease progression . The primary objective study compare change hemoglobin ( Hb ) occur study start end study pre-dialysis patient anemia chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) receive PROCRIT ( epoetin alfa ) every two week ( Q2W ) every four week ( Q4W ) . This study enroll 259 patient randomly assign ( assigned treatment group chance ) receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously ( SC , skin ) one four dos . This study Screening Phase one week patient evaluate study eligibility follow open-label Treatment Phase 16 week patient randomly assign receive epoetin alfa administer skin one four dosing regimen . Patients complete Post-Treatment Follow-Up Phase 1 week ( Week 17 ) . Hemoglobin measure weekly . There dose adjustment initial 4 week study , however , dose may withhold time necessary . Further dose increase may occur 4-week interval dose reduction may occur frequently dose interval assign randomization . Patients eligible epoetin alfa dose adjustment start Week 5 visit Hb &gt; 12 g/dL Hb increase rapidly ( e.g. , &gt; 1.0 g/dL last one two consecutive week ) . The last dose epoetin alfa administer treatment group coincide dose frequency assign group . Epoetin alfa administer later Week 16 treatment group . Hematology , serum chemistry , iron status assess interval throughout study . The number unit blood transfuse , pre-transfusion Hb level , reason transfusion collect . Clinical laboratory result , vital sign , incidence severity adverse event assess monitor study . Protocol Addendum : An Open-Label Extension PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) Maintenance Therapy Administered Every Six Weeks ( Q6W ) Treatment Anemia Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) . The Main Protocol , describe , design evaluate whether patient anemia CKD could start epoetin alfa therapy one four dosing regimen : 10,000 U every week , 20,000 U every two week , 20,000 U every 4 week , 40,000 U every four week . As addendum Main Protocol , sixty ( 60 ) patient complete original protocol hemoglobin ( Hb ) 11 12 g/dL give opportunity enroll open-label extension study begin end Main Protocol timeline ( Week 17 ) . The primary objective open-label extension evaluate epoetin alfa 40,000 U give SC every six week ( Q6W ) , maintain Hb within range 11-12 g/dL patient anemia chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . This open-label extension Screening Phase one week ( Week 17 ) patient evaluate eligibility , Open-Label Treatment Phase 12 week duration ( Weeks 18-Week 30 ) , Post-Treatment Follow-Up Phase 6 week ( end Week 36 6 week date last dose epoetin alfa ) . All patient receive first dose epoetin alfa 40,000 U SC every 6 week begin Week 18 , second dose Week 24 , third final dose Week 30 . During Treatment Phase , Hb measure weekly . Dosing increase open-label extension . A six-week follow-up period require administration Week 30 dose patient receive 3 dos . If Hb fall 10 g/dL time patient require red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion , patient withdrawn open-label extension , Post-Treatment Follow-Up Phase occur 6 week later . Hematology , serum chemistry , iron status assess interval throughout study . The number unit blood transfuse , pre-transfusion Hb level , reason transfusion collect . Clinical laboratory result , vital sign , incidence severity adverse event assess monitor study . Patients receive epoetin alfa skin ( SC ) dose 10,000 unit ( U ) every week , 20,000 U every 2 week , 20,000 U every 4 week 40,000 U every 4 week 16 week . Protocol Addendum : Patients receive epoetin alfa 40,000 U every 6 week 12 week .</detailed_description>
