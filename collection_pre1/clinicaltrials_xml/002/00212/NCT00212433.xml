	<detailed_description>CT colonography show accurate detection colorectal neoplasia enrich patient population generally preferred patient conventional endoscopy barium enema . It advocate acceptable alternative colorectal cancer screen increasingly use investigation symptomatic patient . Ideally , like conventional colonoscopy , CT colonography require clean colon , free residual stool fluid . There however good evidence arduous bowel purgation regime require may produce adverse effect electrolyte imbalance , detrimental overall patient experience compliance subsequent investigation . An ability perform CT colonography reduce bowel purgation , whilst maintain acceptable diagnostic accuracy , would undoubtedly make technique attractive proposition population screen investigation symptomatic patient . Interest generate use orally ingested dilute barium ionate contrast medium prior ro CT colonography `` label '' `` tag '' residual fluid faecal matter reduce laxative . Such oral contrast agent highly attenuate X-rays label residual bowel content appear white CT scan readily distinguish true colonic pathology . Despite early promise limited study , consensus optimum oral contrast type , dose concentration . Anecdotally barium tend best label solid residue whereas iodinate contrast best label fluid , assumption proven . Furthermore known iodinate contrast tends draw fluid bowel , produce wet colon , may suit CT colonography . However , indrawing fluid iodinate contrast gastrograffin produce mild laxative effect , may obviate need formal purgation . The study aim establish optimum reduced preparation-tagging regimen , establish patient experience document diagnostic performance compare conventional colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
