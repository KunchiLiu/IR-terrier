	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation prefer treatment permanent kidney failure . Following transplantation , kidney function must follow closely detect problem investigation appropriate treatment start early . Currently , function monitor use serum creatinine . In clinical trial involve kidney transplant recipient , marker kidney function , serum creatinine , increasingly use outcomes evaluate new treatment . However , serum creatinine accurate sensitive detecting change kidney transplant function . Newer method evaluate kidney function , Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation cystatin C , know accurate marker function patient non-transplant kidney disease . This study compare MDRD estimate cystatin C estimate kidney function accept method ( radioisotope clearance study ) measure true kidney function 250 renal transplant patient . Each patient 2 measurement make least 3 month apart determine accuracy responsiveness change time MDRD equation cystatin C. If result demonstrate new method accurate clinical care research study involve transplant patient greatly enhance . Patients physician would simple test could detect problem earlier precisely monitor response treatment lead improve outcome renal transplant recipient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Hypothesis : Short-term outcome renal transplantation , acute rejection rate , improve dramatically past decade . Unfortunately , success make difficult evaluate new therapy kidney transplantation . Markers kidney function , serum creatinine creatinine clearance , use evaluate kidney transplant function . However , serum creatinine creatinine clearance many limitation correlate poorly glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . The Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) formula show accurate predicting GFR patient kidney disease n't renal transplant . Cystatin C , novel marker renal function , also show accurate transplant non-transplant patient . However , MDRD formula cystatin C properly validate large sample renal transplant recipient . Objectives : The primary objective study determine MDRD formula accurately predict GFR renal transplant recipient . Secondary objective study determine whether : MDRD formula responsive change GFR time , cystatin C accurately predict GFR , MDRD formula accurate estimate equation renal transplant recipient . Research Plan : A prospective cohort design use . Eligible adult renal transplant recipient least 3 month post-transplantation serum creatinine , albumin , urea , cystatin C , 24-hour urine excretion urea , 24-hour urine excretion creatinine , 24-hour urine excretion protein GFR measure study entry least 3 month later . GFR measure use 99Tc-DTPA . Estimates GFR make MDRD equation estimate equation . Renal function also assess measure urinary creatinine clearance combine urea creatinine clearance . The primary analysis determine accuracy ( proportion GFR estimate lie within 30 % measure GFR ) MDRD equation . Secondary analysis perform determine bias ( mean difference measure GFR estimate GFR ) precision ( standard deviation difference measure estimate GFR ) MDRD equation well bias precision change GFR twelve month . Similar analysis perform cystatin C estimate equation . Importance Study : New method accurately measure GFR need clinical care research study involve renal transplant recipient . As new therapy immunosuppressive strategy become available , simple accurate mean ( MDRD equation ) ass response therapy invaluable . Markers kidney function ( serum creatinine , predict GFR ) already use clinical trial involve renal transplant recipient without appropriate evaluation . The proper validation equation predict GFR transplant recipient must carry widely accept practice use research protocol . If study show MDRD equation ( marker kidney function ) accurate transplant patient confidently move forward use validated measure GFR patient care future research study .</detailed_description>
