	<brief_title>Increasing Screening Type 2 Diabetes Women With Previous Gestational Diabetes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 1998 , Canadian Diabetes Association ( CDA ) publish guideline recommend woman diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) screen 6 week 6 month postpartum type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) use 2-hour 75g oral glucose tolerance test . We determine rate screen type 2 DM Ottawa Hospital publication guideline find none woman either period screen follow CDA guideline recommendation although screen test recommend increased utilization . Since publication CDA guideline several study publish demonstrate identification patient abnormal oral glucose tolerance test early treatment prevents onset diabetes . This research recommendation need communicate physician . Methods : Overall Objectives : 1 . To test whether reminder letter outline screen recommendation send patient family physician would increase screen postpartum type 2 DM woman previous GDM letter send physician patient . 2 . To determine patient physician barrier impede adoption recommend screen strategy . Setting : The High Risk Obstetrical Clinics ( HRU ) Ottawa Hospital Civic General Campus . Inclusion Exclusion Criteria : All woman , attend HRU diagnose GDM consider inclusion study . Women approach participation study HRU health care team . If patient agrees , research team contact patient describe study obtain informed consent . ( Appendix 1A ) Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patient Family Physician 2 . Patient 's Family Physician already patient enrol study 3 . Patient already enrol study previous pregnancy 4 . Unable give inform consent English French 5 . History pre-gestational diabetes mellitus 6 . Intra-uterine fetal death still birth Study design Randomization : The design 2 X 2 factorial randomize control trial stratify clinic location . Randomization perform Research Coordinator use computer generate randomization number variable block size 4 8 . The HRU team , investigator , patient blind patient 's group allocation . This process decrease selection bias . Patients randomize postpartum research coordinator ( ensure patient exclusion criterion ) one follow four group . 1 . Physician patient reminder 2 . Physician reminder patient reminder 3 . No physician reminder patient reminder 4 . Neither physician patient reminder . ( Current standard care ) Pre-Intervention Data Collection : Baseline demographic data , maternal characteristic previously show associate type 2 DM , obstetric reproductive history collect time consent maximum two week consent . The mailing address telephone number patient family physician also obtain . A chart abstraction perform approximately 30 day expect date confinement ( EDC ) determine live birth occur weight gender baby abstract . ( Appendix 1B ) Intervention : The screen recommendation strategy randomly allocate research coordinator confirmation live birth ensure mother baby discharge hospital . In unlikely event death , felt patient screen health care team follow-up HRU postpartum type 2 DM may relate cause death . The physician reminder letter consist patient specific recommendation screen postpartum type 2 DM use 2-hour 75g OGTT evidence support recommendation . The letter inform physician patient give requisition recommend screening test . ( Appendix 1C ) The patient reminder consist letter request patient proceed screening , requisition require screening test , well instruction follow screen . ( Appendix 1D ) Primary Secondary Outcome : Primary outcome : The primary outcome proportion patient screen type 2 DM use recommended test , 2-hour 75g OGTT . A Mantel-Hanszel chi-squared test statistic overall comparison proportion 2 X 2 design use . As well Fisher 's exact test comparison specific pair wise group proportion employ . Ascertainment Primary Outcome For patient randomized patient letter requisition , HRU health care team receive result test . For patient randomized physician reminder , reminder request laboratory requisition copy result forward HRU health care team . Also , patient screen ascertain follow method : 1 . At patient follow-up phone interview , patient ask screened test use . 2 . At physician follow-up phone interview , physician nurse ask patient screen , test use , result . All patient similar process similar intensity follow-up screening result . We expect method ascertain primary outcome able determine whether patient screen . The investigator gather information physician patient blind patient 's group allocation . Secondary Outcomes : 1 . Proportion Patients screen test recommend test A Mantel-Hanszel chi-squared test statistic overall comparison proportion 2 X 2 design use . As well Fisher 's exact test comparison specific pair wise group proportion employ depend whether interaction effect find . 2 . Characteristics associate screening : A univariate analysis continuous categorical characteristic woman collect baseline , characteristic baby , birth complication , characteristic physician perform . Any characteristic find statistically associate ( p &amp; lt ; 0.05 ) dependent variable ( Screen positive ) consider inclusion multivariate logistic model . 3 . Characteristics associate screen Type 2 DM IGT : A univariate analysis continuous categorical characteristic woman collect baseline , characteristic baby , birth complication , characteristic physician perform . Any characteristic find statistically associate ( p &amp; lt ; 0.05 ) dependent variable ( Screen positive ) consider inclusion multivariate logistic model . 4 . Survey : The family physicians patient contact semi-structured interview patient least six month postpartum . The investigator perform interview blind patient 's group allocation . They survey determine satisfaction screen method qualitatively review suggestion evaluate barrier adoption screen recommendation increase adoption practice experience . ( Appendix 1E ) For qualitative response , response tabulate percentage report . For response report Likert scale , mean standard deviation calculate . These result use aid planning process future study . Sample size : The design 2x2 factorial design power study detect difference proportion four group . If assume power 80 % alpha error 5 % would require 67 patient group detect difference proportion 17 % , 20 % , 35 % group receive either intervention combine . We assume combination patient physician letter would lead high screen rate . A large sample size require interaction suspect ensure study sufficient power detect interaction.16 The total sample size study would 268 patient . From previous study evaluate screen rate use 2 hour 75g OGTT year 2000 Ottawa Hospital find 0 % patient screen . Conway et al14 population woman diagnose GDM achieve 17 % screen rate woman give requisition screen reminder letter outline importance screen test . Feasibility Issues : At Ottawa Hospital 168 149 woman deliver GDM 1997 2000 respectively . Averaging two year , would estimate approximately 160 woman per year deliver Ottawa Hospital GDM . Also , General campus Ottawa Hospital , approximately 30 patient per year follow GDM HRU deliver Montfort hospital . Therefore , would estimate would potential study population 190 woman Ottawa Hospital per year . We would also assume 10 % woman would decline participate study , reduce potential population 171 woman . Therefore would anticipate study would take almost two year complete enrollment . Issues may affect success study follow : acceptability study patient population interest , whether consent process would increase screen rate compare screen rate year 2000 , publication new guideline . It unlikely consent process would enough increase screen rate alone study physician behaviour change show multiple intervention required.11 The Clinical Practice Guideline Group CDA start meet discus update guideline . Evidence publish since publication guideline 1998 lend support recommendation screen 2 hour OGTT . Ethical consideration This study receive approval Ottawa Hospital Research Ethic Board . All record paper electronic store within Hospital jurisdiction Cinical Epidemiogy Program Ottawa Health Research Institute . All record confidential Investigators Research Associate access record . Knowledge Translation dissemination plan The result study publish peer-reviewed journal . The strategy lead high proportion patient screen consider adoption part routine clinical care Ottawa Hospital . The result survey utilized improve strategy significant barrier adoption identify . The physician member team ( Dr. 's Clark , Keely , Karovitch ) utilized opinion leader encourage dissemination `` best '' screen strategy hospital physician group involve care patient gestational diabetes .</detailed_description>
