	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Study Phenylbutyrate Huntington 's Disease ( PHEND-HD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Huntington 's disease ( HD ) autosomal dominant disorder result selective loss neuron striatum—an area brain control movement , balance , walking—and area brain . The disease characterize progressive motor cognitive decline . There cure even plausible treatment offset fatal course disease . Therefore , treatment ameliorates disease would enormous importance . The purpose double-blind , placebo-controlled study—with open-label follow-up—is determine safety tolerability 15-grams daily oral phenylbutyrate people HD . The study enroll 60 individual . Eligible participant initially randomize receive either phenylbutyrate matching placebo 4 week . After placebo-controlled phase , participant enter open-label phase receive phenylbutyrate 12 week . Participants follow one month phenylbutyrate . This combination short-term double-blind , placebo-controlled phase follow long open-label phase favor primary goal detect toxicity intolerability facilitate recruitment maximize number subject study drug .</detailed_description>
