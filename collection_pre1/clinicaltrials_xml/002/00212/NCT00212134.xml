	<detailed_description>Intraocular lens commonly accept treatment cataract old child use increasingly young child infant . Intraocular lens superior contact lenses closely replicate optic crystalline lens , require daily ongoing care , ensure least partial optical correction time . The simplicity improve visual outcome intraocular lens correction may make care child unilateral congenital cataract less stressful parent . However , contact lens remain accepted treatment child 1 year age due concern long-term safety intraocular lenses potential large myopic shift develop eye grow . Contact lenses provide excellent visual result infant treated bilateral congenital cataract ; however , two-thirds infant treat contact lenses unilateral congenital cataract remain legally blind aphakic eye . These poor visual outcome usually ascribe competition sound eye poor compliance patch contact lens wear regimen . Data pilot study literature suggest superior visual result obtain intraocular lens use correct unilateral aphakia infancy , eye experience complication . Intraocular lens increasingly implanted infant regardless whether perform trial . By perform clinical trial , determine high rate complication intraocular lens offset improve visual outcome decrease parent stress . The Infant Aphakia Treatment Study ( IATS ) multi-center randomized clinical trial compare intraocular lens contact lens correction monocular aphakia . Infants enrol 4 year period . Infants 28 210 day age visually significant cataract one eye eligible . Cataract surgery perform standardized fashion surgeon certify study . Surgery consist lensectomy , posterior capsulotomy , anterior vitrectomy . Infants randomize time surgery one two treatment group . Infants randomize intraocular lens group intraocular lens implant capsular bag . Spectacles subsequently use correct residual refractive error . Infants randomize contact lens group fit contact lens immediately surgery . Both group receive patch therapy follow-up . All child examine Investigators fix interval use standard protocol major endpoint assess age 12 month Traveling Vision Examiner . We currently continuation project ( beyond 5 year ) order perform subjective visual acuity test 4.5 year age 5 year follow-up vision ocular health exam child . We submit competitive application able single visit patient cohort reach 10 year age . This past amblyogenic period permit accurate comparative assessment visual acuity ocular health primary intervention group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Visually significant unilateral congenital cataract ( central opacity equal great 3 mm size ) . Cataract surgery perform patient 28 210 day age least 41 postconceptional week . The cataract know acquire trauma sideeffect treatment administer postnatally radiation medical therapy . A corneal diameter le 9 mm measure horizontal meridian use caliper . An intraocular pressure 25 mm Hg great affect eye measure Perkins tonometer , tonopen , pneumatonometer . Persistent fetal vasculature ( PFV ) cause stretch ciliary process tractional retinal detachment . Active uveitis sign suggestive previous episode uveitis posterior synechiae keratic precipitate . The child product preterm pregnancy ( &lt; 36 gestational week ) . Screening prematurity base clinician 's best assessment gestational age . If physician uncertain regard gestational age , review medical record contact pediatrician and/or obstetrician use confirm gestational age delivery . Unless clinician uncertain whether child bear less 36 week , confirmation gestational age via medical record review may delay enrollment . Retinal disease may limit visual potential eye retinopathy prematurity . Previous intraocular surgery . Optic nerve disease may limit visual potential eye optic nerve hypoplasia . The fellow eye ocular disease might reduce visual potential . The child medical condition know limit ability obtain visual acuity 12 month 4 year age . Refusal Parent/Legal Guardian sign inform consent randomize one two treatment group . Followup child feasible child would able return regular followup examination outcome assessment ( e.g . transportation difficulty , relocation , etc . ) .</criteria>
