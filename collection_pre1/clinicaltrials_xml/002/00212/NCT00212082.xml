	<brief_summary>We hypothesize change tumor gene expression profile vary response different sequence type chemotherapy , gene expression change correlate tumor response . We also look correlate drug pharmacokinetics treatment toxicity genotype drug metabolize enzyme tranporters.Patients metastatic breast cancer measurable primary breast tumor randomize one two alternate sequence adriamycin docetaxel . Serial tumor biopsy plasma sample obtain gene expression proteomic study identify biomarkers predict chemotherapy response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Expression Profiles Predicting Chemotherapy Response Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significant inter-individual variation exist tumor response chemotherapy toxicity unique tumor patient factor . Individual drug distinct mechanism action may induce specific genomic proteomic change may use predictor response . We plan study serial genomic proteomic profile primary breast tumor treat one two sequence alternate adriamycin ( A ) docetaxel ( T ) , A &gt; T &gt; A &gt; T &gt; A &gt; T , T &gt; A &gt; T &gt; A &gt; T &gt; A , 75mg/m2 3 weekly drug . Pharmacokinetic analysis drug perform ; amplify tumor RNA hybridize Affymetrix® HG-U133+2 array ; tumor protein fractionate profiled ProteinChip® Array SELDI MS ( Ciphergen ) . Tumor gene expression proteomic change correlate treatment response identify biomarkers may predict chemotherapy sensitivity .</detailed_description>
