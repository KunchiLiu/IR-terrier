	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes associated damage , dysfunction , failure various organ . The coexistence diabetes hypertension particularly damaging cardiac peripheral vascular structure function . These disease , either alone combine , result increase leave ventricular mass wall thickness , leave ventricular diastolic dysfunction , impaired endothelial vasodilator function , increase vascular stiffness . Although several health organization endorse exercise training therapeutic modality type 2 diabetes , study exercise diabetes focus glycemic control cardiovascular health . Although exercise lower blood pressure person without diabetes , profound gap knowledge effect exercise train blood pressure cardiovascular health person type 2 diabetes . The primary specific aim study determine exercise training reduces blood pressure person type 2 diabetes high normal blood pressure mild hypertension prehypertension Stage 1 ( mild ) hypertension . Subjects randomize 6-months exercise training , consistent establish guideline diabetes hypertension , usual care control group . The second specific aim identify effect exercise train parameter cardiac peripheral vascular structure function relate cardiovascular disease diabetes hypertension . We assess leave ventricular mass , leave ventricular diastolic function , endothelial vasodilator function , vascular stiffness use high-resolution ultrasound , Doppler echocardiography , magnetic resonance imaging . We also examine interleukin-6 high-resolution C-reactive protein novel risk factor cardiovascular disease diabetes determine effect exercise train inflammatory process . Because exercise training improve fitness may improve body composition regional fat distribution , association change parameter change blood pressure cardiac peripheral vascular structure function analyze . An equal number men woman enrol , third specific aim study examine gender difference response exercise training . This study expand scientific knowledge defines exercise guideline provide new insight mechanism exercise reduce blood pressure improve cardiovascular health person type 2 diabetes hypertension .</detailed_description>
