	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 18 50 year old obese men premenopausal woman BMI 2955 Chronically ( 6 month ) sleepdeprived , define sleep regular basis less equal approximately 61/2 hours/night history objective device ( wrist activity monitor sleep log ) . INCLUSION CRITERIA : External comparison subject extension Effectiveness Study must meet criterion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosed sleep disorder include : Chronic insomnia Untreated sleep disordered breathing ( sleep apnea level severity [ use standardized criterion measurement ] , diagnose UARS [ upper airway resistance syndrome ] would impair ability increase sleep duration [ Intervention Group ] maintain sleep duration [ Comparison Group ] . CPAP treatment place 3 month improve sleep acceptable ) . Restless leg syndrome periodic limb movement disorder Parasomnias ( include REM sleep behavior disorder , confusional arousal , sleep terror , sleepwalk , sleep violence ) Primary bruxism allow long interfere ability sleep additional 90 minute night Narcolepsy Central apnea . Unstable weight ( voluntary loss BMI great 5 % past 6 month ) ; currently enrol weight loss program Untreated uncontrolled diabetes Severe uncontrolled hypertension Other chronic organ disease diagnosis include : COPD Chronic cardiac arrhythmia require treatment Gastroesophageal disorder associate sleeprelated symptom . Medications chronic use prescription overthecounter medication know affect sleep ( e.g. , systemic steroid , NSAIDs ) current anticonvulsant therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia Acromegaly , hypothyroidism ( unless stable replacement dose thyroid hormone ) , Cushing disease endocrine disorder know affect sleep Poorly control major depression ( subject stable pharmacological antidepressant treatment 3 month remission without substantial weight gain eligible ) . Other current DSMIV diagnosis , include : Eating disorder bulimia nervosa binge eat disorder Anxiety disorder PTSD panic attack Mania Schizophrenia . Medication substance abuse excessive alcohol consumption drug abuse dependence may pose threat compliance Being rotate worker , shift worker ( work evening night ) , long distance commuter ( approximately 90 minute way ) , travel frequently outside time zone ; occupation may require special vigilance drive truck , bus , cab ; operate heavy machinery ; pilot air traffic controller Being likely move different geographical area study Having sleep partner would make compliance study requirement difficult Pregnancy lactation Menopause Chronic excessive caffeine use ( habitual intake 500 mg/day ) Any condition opinion principal investigator make study participation compliance problematic .</criteria>
