	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effectiveness safety sustained- release hydromorphone , formulate release slowly time , take daily , controlled- release oxycodone take twice daily , patient chronic non-cancer pain . The study also determine dose sustained-release hydromorphone provide level pain control equal pain control provide control-released oxycodone ( equi-analgesic dosage ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Safety Sustained-release Hydromorphone ( Strong Opioid ) Patients With Chronic Noncancer Pain .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional immediate-release form hydromorphone oxycodone relatively short duration action require dose every 4 6 hour . To counterbalance drawback repeat opioid intake , sustained-release formulation oxycodone hydromorphone develop allow twice-daily dosing . Subsequently , novel , once-daily , extended-release hydromorphone formulation develop enhance ease treatment improve effectiveness treatment severe pain . This randomized , open-label , comparative , parallel-group , 24-week flexible-dose study patient chronic noncancer pain severe enough require continuous opioid therapy . Patients receive either 8 mg sustained-release hydromorphone , take daily 10 mg controlled-release oxycodone , take twice daily . Individual adjustment dose perform achieve satisfactory pain control , maximum daily dosage 32 mg hydromorphone 80 mg oxycodone . The primary efficacy outcome determination dose hydromorphone produce level pain control equal pain control provide oxycodone ( equi-analgesic dose ) . Safety monitor throughout study . The study hypothesis sustained-release hydromorphone take daily well tolerated inferior regard pain control controlled-release oxycodone take twice daily . Amendment : Amendment make duration study duration '24 week ' '52 week ' order collect long-term safety efficacy data . OROS hydromorphone 8 , 16 , 32 mg tablet QD SR oxycodone 10 , 20 , 40 mg tablet BID . Individual adjustments dose perform achieve satisfactory pain control 24 week . Amendment : treatment duration extend 52 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient chronic noncancer pain severe enough require continuous opioid therapy ( score least 5 `` pain right '' 11 point numeric rating scale ) never receive opioid currently treat weak opioid , experience insufficient pain control . Patients treat strong opioids ( include hydromorphone oxycodone ) within last 4 week prior study inclusion probably undergo treatment ( e.g . neurological technique , surgery ) within next 6 month , may abruptly alter degree nature pain experience patient history disease ( ) , current illness , therapy would preclude participation study patient pregnant nursing .</criteria>
