	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Surgery Hip Versus Standard Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional technique total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) require complete visualization acetabulum proximal femur since anatomic landmark crucial correct orientation prosthetic component . All surgeon teach wide surgical exposure one important factor perform successful THA . Traditionally , impossible achieve accurate fixation orientation component without complete visualization bony landmark . These extensile exposure facilitate accurate implant alignment , expense extensive soft tissue dissection . Little clinical research undertaken relate surgical approach postoperative complication patient function . Furthermore , despite good overall result THA , recovery time improve function lengthy . Blood loss expect directly relate extent surgical exposure influence patient outcomes . Based upon fact , important principle arthroplasty surgery minimize amount soft tissue trauma able achieve surgical goal reconstruct arthritic hip joint . By definition , minimally invasive surgical ( MIS ) procedures result less soft tissue disruption , turn reduce pain , expedite healing , decrease recovery time , potentially reduce number associate complication .</detailed_description>
