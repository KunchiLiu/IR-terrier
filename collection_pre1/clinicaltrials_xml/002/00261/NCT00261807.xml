	<brief_summary>Daptomycin new antimicrobial agent activity resistant Gram positive cocci include MRSA . The phase 3 clinical trial skin soft tissue infection ( SSTI ) Staphylococci Streptococci already demonstrate daptomycin noninferior comparator agent ( vancomycin beta-lactams ) ( 10 ) . Although clinical trial include patient clostridial infection , vitro data support activity daptomycin variety clostridial specie ( 11 ) ( Clostridium perfringens ) Therefore , trial include patient clostridial infection specie . Additionally , patient SSTI study ill propose study population . Therefore treatment severe infection , would like use high dose daptomycin ( 6mg/kg/dose ) . The reason use high dose daptomycin subgroup follow : 1 . Patients severely ill increase volume distribution ; therefore low serum concentration daptomycin . These patient might require high dose daptomycin achieve desire serum concentration . 2 . One organisms involve necrotizing fasciitis enterococcus ( both-fecalis faecium ) . E.faecium high MICs daptomycin would require high dose drug achieve adequate free ( unbound ) serum concentration drug . 3 . Both necrotizing fasciitis endocarditis serious deep seat infection . The clinical trial endocarditis use 6mg/kg/dose daptomycin . Therefore optimal treatment necrotizing fasciitis , justifiable use high dose daptomycin . Objective : To evaluate clinical microbiological efficacy safety high dose daptomycin therapy treatment patient severe necrotizing skin soft tissue infection . Type Study : Open label , single center study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At shock trauma center , management patient NSTI conduct follow fashion : All new patient NSTI admit trauma center 12-bed shock trauma admit area . Full hemodynamic resuscitation undertaken . The on-call soft-tissue infection team mobilize . Standard investigation , radiographic evaluation , laboratory test , include gram stain culture specimen , obtain . The University Maryland Medical Systems/shock trauma laboratory utilized hematology , biochemical , bacteriologic study . Aggressive empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy institute . The standard antibiotic therapy NSTI 's shock trauma include follow : Gram negative rod : Piperacillin/Tazobactam quinolones aztreonam / + aminoglycosides Anaerobes : Piperacillin/Tazobactam Metronidazole Clindamycin Gram positive cocci ( MRSA/VRE ) : Piperacillin/Tazobactam Clindamycin Gram positive cocci ( MRSA ) : Vancomycin Gram positive cocci ( VRE ) : Linezolid For purpose study , daptomycin would replace Vancomycin , Linezolid clindamycin gram positive coverage . Prior antibiotic therapy , culture data , comorbid condition , allergy history variable may result institution different antibiotic regimen . The patient take shock trauma operate room debulking infected tissue ( excision debridement ) reculturing . Postoperatively , patient move critical intensive care unit management monitoring . When patient stable , HBO begin within 12 hour arrival . Once patient enrol study follow procedure follow : Antibiotic Therapy : Once patient consent , antibiotic therapy start . The combination regimen include follow drug standard approve dose . - Gram negative bacteria : Aztreonam ciprofloxacin / + aminoglycosides* - Anaerobic bacteria : Metronidzole - Gram positive bacteria : Daptomycin For patient recommend dose Daptomycin 6 mgm/kg/day administer 30 minute . A pharmacokinetic study perform obese patient demonstrate daptomycin could dose base total body weight . No adjustment daptomycin dose require base solely obesity ( 12 ) . Any patient develops decrease renal function study point his/her creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) fall 30 mL/min would dose adjusted 6 mg/kg every 48 hour , interval recommend package insert . This include patient go require conventional hemodialysis . Since data available pharmacokinetics ( PK ) daptomycin patient receive continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) , therefore recommendation dosage adjustment , patient would remove study initiate standard care regimen . Treatment duration 7-14 day . - Aminoglycosides add suspicion documentation resistant gram negative rod . At various interval , follow information collect procedure follow : ( See attach study schedule ) Baseline 1 . Demographic data - age , gender , weight , height , nursing home residence 2 . Number length previous hospitalization last six month 3 . Nature duration symptom 4 . Admission status include vital sign , GCS , APACHE , SIRS score , CBC diff , CPK , lactate , BUN , creatinine , liver function test , blood gas ventilator , culture wound-aerobic anaerobic . 5 . Prior surgery NSTI - number date 6 . Comorbid condition - diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , immunocompromised , etc . 7 . Prior antibiotic last six month - dose/route/type 8 . Prior culture NSTI , presence resistant bacteria . 9 . Wound size - length , depth cm . 10 . Use drug HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor At various interval , follow procedure follow : . - GCS , vital sign , CBC , CPK , BUN , creatinine , liver function , blood gas ventilate - Wound size cm - Surgical intervention - Cultures wound , ( aerobic anaerobic ) , blood , super infection . Preferably culture debrided tissue purulent material obtain . If tissue pu available , deep culture wound obtain . The culture evaluate microbiologic lab gram stain , culture ( aerobic anaerobic already indicate ) antimicrobiological sensitivity ( standard CLSI ( NCCLS ) technique . The organism study identify genus specie level . - LOS - hospital , ICU - Wound dress - type - Use vacuum assist dress - Duration antibiotic therapy - Adverse event - Mortality - Patient evaluate clinically daily basis several clinical service ( surgery , infectious disease , critical care , hyperbaric medicine ) safety lab obtain every 3-5days . If patient fail therapy base available microbiological determinant , patient change appropriate antibiotic regimen . The End point study follow : - clinical cure 7-14 day - clinical failure point 72 hour treatment - patient clinically cure persistence initial infective organism wound culture , study would terminate . However , patient bad appropriate treatment initiate study drug discontinue . - patient experience serious adverse event relate study drug , study drug terminate . - patient decide withdraw consent . Clinical Response end treatment ( 7-14 day ) test cure ( 3-28 day ) post end treatment ) : - Cure : Resolution clinically significant sign symptoms* associate infect wound present time study entry additional gram-positive antibiotic therapy need end treatment visit . - Improved : Partial resolution clinical sign symptoms* wound ( e.g. , although patient 's clinical status completely return pre-infection baseline , infectious process control ) additional gram-positive antibiotic therapy need end treatment visit . - Failure : No response worsen clinical sign symptoms infection ; new sign symptom infection present ; additional gram-positive antibiotic therapy need end treatment visit . - Unable Evaluate : Unable determine response ; e.g. , evaluation perform time point , administration non-study antibiotic effective study pathogen . * Clinically significant sign symptom : - pain proportion clinical finding - tenderness palpation - elevate temp . [ 100.4 ] reduce temp . [ &gt; 96 ] - WBC count &gt; 12.000/cu.mm - swell - erythema - induration - pu formation Microbiological Response End Treatment Test Cure Visit : - Documented Eradicated : The baseline infect pathogen absent end treatment determine negative culture result . - Presumed Eradicated : The baseline infection presume absent end treatment determine `` nothing culture '' . - Documented Persistent : The baseline infect pathogen present end treatment . Patients also monitor 3 - 28 day post therapy . Analysis Because small sample size ( 25 patient ) state , study serve preliminary study obtain data evaluate presence positive trend term outcome patient treat Daptomycin . If favorable , would warrant large prospective control study large sample size would allow robust statistical analysis . Variables initial analysis include antibiotic day , intensive care unit hospital length stay mortality .</detailed_description>
