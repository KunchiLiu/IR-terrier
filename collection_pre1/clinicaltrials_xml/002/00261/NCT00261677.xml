	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effect Weekly PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Placebo Anemia Quality Life Children With Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROCRIT® ( epoetin alfa ) analogue erythropoetin , hormone secrete kidney know stimulate red blood cell production . PROCRIT® approve give three time per week treat anemia adult cancer patient receive chemotherapy . Once per week dose adult cancer patient receive chemotherapy investigational approve FDA . The use PROCRIT® child cancer investigational approve FDA . ( Please note : Since completion study , weekly dose PROCRIT® adult cancer patient approve FDA June 2004 use PROCRIT® child cancer approve FDA October 2005 ) . The use PROCRIT® improve quality life investigational approve FDA . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study evaluate efficacy safety once-weekly dosing PROCRIT® placebo anemia child cancer undergo myelosuppressive chemotherapy , assess effect quality life . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio receive either PROCRIT® placebo administer intravenously . Randomization stratify cancer type , one stratum child diagnose malignant solid tumor Hodgkin 's Disease , second stratum child diagnose Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ( ALL ) Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) . The initial dose study medication 600 Units/kg maximum dose 40,000 Units intravenously ( IV ) weekly , placebo , 16 week . The study medication adjust 900 Units/kg , maximum dose 60,000 Units IV weekly , hemoglobin increase least 1 g/dL Study Week 4/5 . Patients see evaluate base patient 's schedule chemotherapy regimen . Patients receive chemotherapy weekly , every two week , every four week ( 4-week group ) , schedule study visit occur every four week . The study investigate effectiveness weekly dosing PROCRIT® anemia quality life child cancer undergo myelosuppressive chemotherapy . The primary measure effectiveness change patient-reported Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ( PedsQL Inventory ) baseline last assessment . Other measure effectiveness include difference hemoglobin level , transfusion requirement , quality life outcome . Safety assess compare incidence severity adverse experience PROCRIT® group versus placebo group . Clinical laboratory test ( hematology , iron profile , serum chemistry ) , physical examination , vital sign measurement also assess . 600 900 Units/kg intravenously ( IV ) either PROCRIT® placebo . Initial dose 600 Units/kg ( maximum dose 40,000 Units IV weekly ) 16 week . If hemoglobin increase &gt; = 1 g/dL Week 4/5 , dose adjust 900 Units/kg ( maximum dose 60,000 Units IV weekly ) .</detailed_description>
