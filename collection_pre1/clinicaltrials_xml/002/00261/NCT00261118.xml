	<brief_summary>There broad support hypothesis Ulcerative colitis auto-immune disease . Rituximab antibody protein remove subgroup white blood cell ( B lymphocytes ) circulation . These cell capacity generate auto-antibodies typify auto-immune disease . Although Rituximab mainly use treat B lymphocyte malignancy ( lymphoma ) also use promising result Rheumatoid arthritis excellent safety record . This small placebo-controlled trial ass efficacy safety patient steroid-resistant active ulcerative colitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>WHAT IS THE PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED ? Lack effective cure Ulcerative colitis . WHAT IS THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED ? That rituximab may effective active ulcerative colitis . WHY IS A TRIAL NEEDED NOW ? Rituximab use treat 300,000 patient B lymphocyte malignancy show excellent safety record [ 6-8 ] . Published pilot study show excellent result rituximab patient autoimmune disease immune-mediated thrombocytopaenia , Wegeners granulomatosis , cold agglutinin disease , myasthenia gravis , rheumatoid arthritis SLE [ 11-17 ] . Together increase evidence support pathogenic role pANCA associate ulcerative colitis , study rituximab ulcerative colitis timely . Moreover significant advance treatment ulcerative colitis recent year introduction cyclosporin probably halve colectomy rate [ 18,19 ] risk considerable side effect drug-related mortality estimate 2 % . HAS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW BEEN CARRIED OUT AND WHAT WERE THE FINDINGS ? A Medline search `` rituximab ulcerative colitis '' yield response . There recent report use single patient ileocolonic Crohn 's disease also immune-mediated thrombocytopaenia [ 20 ] . The thrombocytopaenia improve Crohn 's disease . It argue though little evidence autoimmunity Crohn 's disease seem many case due defect phagocyte function , eg association recently describe NOD2/CARD15 genetic alteration . 2.5 HOW WILL THE RESULTS OF THIS TRIAL BE USED ? This trial establish whether rituximab effective achieve remission patient ulcerative colitis fail respond conventional therapy corticosteroid . Because background evidence efficacy initial study small two centre study placebo blinding . If result study promising , would use pilot data power calculation large multicentre study . 3.1 WHAT IS THE PROPOSED TRIAL DESIGN ? A `` placebo-blinded '' study 16 patient receive rituximab 6 patient receive placebo ( 0.9 % saline ) . 3.2 WHAT ARE THE PLANNED TRIAL INTERVENTIONS ? Patients receive either ( ) rituximab 1g 500 ml 0.9 % saline infuse peripheral vein four hour ( see append infusion chart ) , ( ii ) 500 ml 0.9 % saline infuse peripheral vein two hour placebo . This regimen repeat 2 week . This protocol base dose regimen prove efficacious rheumatoid arthritis . All patient also receive paracetamol 1g orally chlorpheniramine ( Piriton ) 10mg intravenously immediately prior Rituximab/placebo infusion . All patient continue receive oral prednisolone 40mg/day 2 week 30mg two week , 20mgs/day two week , reduce 5mg/day every 7 day prednisolone . 3.3 WHAT IS THE PROPOSED DURATION OF THE TREATMENT PERIOD ? Two treatment , two week apart . 3.4 WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA ? see early 3.5 WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED OUTCOME MEASURES ? see early 3.6 WILL HEALTH SERVICE RESEARCH ISSUES BE ADDRESSED ? Not Applicable 3.7 WHAT IS THE PROPOSED FREQUENCY/DURATION OF FOLLOW UP ? Patients review one , two four , eight , twelve twenty four week . Patients monitor thereafter routine gastroenterology clinic follow . 3.8 HOW WILL THE OUTCOME MEASURES BE MEASURED AT FOLLOW-UP ? Patients complete daily diary detail bowel frequency , presence blood stool , change medical therapy new worsening symptoms The IBD quality life questionnaire complete baseline week 4 12 . Patients also diary card record detail symptom note trial ass adverse effect trial treatment . 3.9 WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR ALLOCATING PATIENTS TO TRIAL GROUPS ? Randomization allocate block five pharmacy department hospital . 3.10 WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED METHODS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST OTHER SOURCES OF BIAS ? Controls ( know Pharmacy Department ) receive placebo saline infusion . 3.11 WHAT IS THE PROPOSED SAMPLE SIZE ? A `` placebo-blinded '' study 16 patient receive rituximab 8 patient receive placebo ( 0.9 % saline ) . This provide 80 % power exclude 80 % remission rate active treatment compare assume 25 % placebo response . 3.12 WHAT IS THE PLANNED RECRUITMENT RATE ? 1-2 patient per month 3.13 ARE THERE LIKELY TO BE ANY PROBLEMS WITH COMPLIANCE ? No . 3.14 WHAT IS THE LIKELY RATE OF LOSS TO FOLLOW UP ? 100 % follow achievable . 3.15 HOW MANY CENTRES WILL BE INVOLVED ? Two 3.16 WHAT IS THE PROPOSED TYPE OF ANALYSIS ? Formal hypothesis test primary outcome compare chi-square test . Wilcoxon sign rank test use comparison baseline change secondary quantitative endpoint . 3.17 WHAT IS THE PROPOSED FREQUENCY OF ANALYSIS ? Once completion . 3.18 ARE THERE ANY PLANNED SUBGROUP ANALYSES ? Subgroup analysis may perform accord pANCA status . 3.19 WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED RESEARCH COST OF THE TRIAL ? Cost therapy plus £800 pharmacy fee plus £2200 towards ethic submission/ research nurse time/ cost pANCA assay provide unrestricted educational grant Roche UK . 3.20 IS THERE AN NHS SERVICE SUPPORT COST OF THIS TRIAL , AND IF SO WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED COST ? The NHS cost would modest , involve routine test full blood count SMAC current practice monitoring patient relapse inflammatory bowel disease .</detailed_description>
