	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - The primary objective study evaluate clinical efficacy i.e . show respect clinical cure rate , Ketek® ( telithromycin ) treatment community acquire respiratory tract infection : community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) , acute bacterial exacerbation chronic bronchitis ( AECB ) acute sinusitis ( AS ) , outpatient . Secondary Objectives : The secondary objective : - Further assess efficacy Ketek® ( telithromycin ) consider rate additional antibacterial prescribe treat primary infection ; rate hospitalisation due complication primary infection assessment bacteriological data , chest X-ray sinus X-ray available . - Evaluate safety Ketek® ( telithromycin ) Adverse Event ( AE ) Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) reporting</brief_summary>
