	<brief_summary>Alendronate safe effective drug treat osteoporosis post-menopausal woman . However , safety efficacy increase bone mineral density chronic peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient investigate . Etidronate , another bisphosphonate , suppress extent coronary artery calcification chronic hemodialysis patient . The hypothesis study alendronate increase bone mineral density suppress aortic coronary artery calcification chronic peritoneal dialysis patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Alendronate Suppress Calcification Improve Bone Density Chronic Peritoneal Dialysis Patients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design The study prospective , randomize cross-over study . Fifty patient include . All participant randomly allocate either group 1 group 2 . Each group consist 25 patient . Group 1 patient receive alendronate 70 mg weekly first 24 week study , group 2 patient receive dose drug every week second 24 week . The extent coronary artery aortic calcification evaluate use multidetector spiral compute tomography , whereas bone mineral density measure dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry . Both examination perform week 0 , 24 48 participant . Serum level calcium keep within normal limit serum level phosphorus keep 6 mg/dl . Administration Alendronate One tablet alendronate ( 70 mg per tablet ) swallow patient every week water least 30 minute breakfast , beverage medication day treatment period . Patients must lie least 30 minute take drug . Measurement Coronary Artery Aortic Calcification Multidetector spiral computerize tomography ( CT ) chest perform week 0 , 24 48 participant measure extent coronary aortic calcification . Measurement Bone Density Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry perform week 0 , 24 48 participant measure density bone . Demographic Clinical Characteristics Patients Patients characteristic age sex document . Clinical parameter include body height , body weight , duration dialysis , calcium concentration dialysate , medication use record . Blood pressure measure clinical visit 3 time patient sit least 15 minute . Collection Laboratory Data Fasting serum level albumin , phosphorus , calcium , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) hemoglobin level patient check study entry every month . Fasting serum level triglyceride , total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-chol ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-chol ) , hypersensitive C-reactive protein ( CRP ) patient check study entry every 3 month . Record Adverse Effects Alendronate Any adverse effect alendronate record every month clinic visit . Compliance Patients Compliance patient monitor use telephone call every week treatment period alendronate .</detailed_description>
