	<brief_summary>The IMPACT study international targeted prostate screening study men increase prostate cancer risk due presence know pathogenic mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene . There approximately 150 men know BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation UK . Research show men increase risk develop prostate cancer information need pathogenesis prostate cancer define group role screen men . The study offer annual PSA screen men determine incidence prostate cancer group . The study also look new marker early prostate cancer cohort . The power calculation study 850 carrier 850 control ( age-matched men without BRCA1/2 mutation ) . It therefore essential gain international collaboration meet target recruit 850 men know mutation control group 850 men test negative know familial mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The IMPACT Study - Identification Men With Genetic Predisposition ProstAte Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer significant public health problem . In EU approximately 200,000 men diagnose annually prostate cancer . There 24,000 case per year England Wales 10,000 death . The incidence increasing , even screen-detected cancer consider , within next year become common cancer UK men . alteration breast cancer predisposition gene BRCA1 BRCA2 , may predispose prostate cancer ( PC ) study increase evidence-base . There evidence , least BRCA2 carrier , prostate cancer men may aggressive early detection could theoretically reduce mortality . It report unaffected individual family multiple case PC show increase percentage raise PSA level , use PSA level predictive value healthy male BRCA1/2 mutation study . If PSA use screen tool BRCA1/2 mutation carrier , would need gain good understand pathogenesis PC men determine whether different baseline PSA profile compare control . The high prevalence hormone-dependent/secreting tumour breast , ovary prostate BRCA1/2 carrier suggest important role hormone receptor development cancer . Androgens androgen receptor consider crucial element PC pathogenesis . Therefore male sex hormone measure determine hormone profile BRCA1/2 carrier compare control group . There strong evidence BRCA1/2 play important role DNA repair cell cycling . Therefore , investigate abnormality metabolic process individual BRCA1/2 mutation cell cycling may abnormal . Analysis protein ( proteomics ) metabolite ( metabonomics ) powerful approach identify protein metabolite involve cancer formation . The analysis proteins metabolite enable u investigate effect presence BRCA1/2 mutation aid identification new biomarkers prostate cancer . The target population group 850 male carry know pathogenic mutation BRCA1/2 gene ( 500 BRCA1 350 BRCA2 ) . These men recruit genetics clinic across UK world . A control group men test negative know pathogenic mutation run family also recruit genetics clinic . All participant invite attend annually 5 year appointment last approximately 30 minute discuss study detail give write consent agree participate . They 50ml blood sample take ask provide urine sample every year . They also require complete short family medical history questionnaire . These appointment either take place centre register , Royal Marsden Hospital , home depend arrangement make collaborate consultant patient preference . The PSA level participant measure locally . If PSA &gt; 3.0ng/ml , ten core prostatic biopsy offer , carry consultant urologist . Ten biopsy use diagnostic purpose , two extra biopsy sample take research analysis patient fully inform write consent prior procedure carry . If ten core identify presence prostate cancer , receive treatment advise local centre . The PSA quality control batch test reference lab . If value locally &lt; 3.0ng/ml &gt; 3ng/ml reference lab remeasured locally . If high grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( PIN ) detect sample inconclusive sextant biopsy repeat 6 week recommend , accordance ERSPC protocol . If atypical acinus detect immediate biopsy undertaken .</detailed_description>
