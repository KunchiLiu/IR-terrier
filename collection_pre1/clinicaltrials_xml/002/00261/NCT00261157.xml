	<brief_summary>This research do test two-way video system mount top robot . After surgery act see evaluate patient hospital call standard `` rounding '' . This research study allow doctor see speak patient use two-way video system - `` telerounding '' , stay hospital . The purpose study assess safety telerounding patient hospital stay . Our hypothesis post-operative morbidity time identification post-operative morbidity vary new method rounding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Department Urology University California , Davis make major commitment development novel application advance telecommunication practice modern health care . Telemedicine become increasingly important although underutilized component modern healthcare . To date , telemedicine limited physician education form video conferencing seminar , provide specialist consultation rural medical clinic . However , give recent technological advance wireless Internet capability decrease cost service , see alternate capability technology . As well know , act see patient bedside hospitalize call “ rounding. ” For patient undergone elective minimally invasive surgical procedure , laparoscopy , hospital stay become brief event . In fact , convalescence procedure measure day rather week . For individual , hospitalization necessary allow delivery IV fluid , check serum chemistry blood count wait bowel function return . To end , physician bedside visit large part opportunity relay information regard progress recovery base objective laboratory vital sign measure . We develop video-conferencing system allow physician see speak patient remote location ( telerounding ) . In randomized trial telerounds versus standard round conduct I Urology Fellow Johns Hopkins , examine impact form post-operative management element patient satisfaction hospitalization . We find patient manage telerounding system give high rating hospitalization manage standard bedside round . One application use teleconferencing primary mode post-operative care management ( telerounding ) . In prior study perform Johns Hopkins , patient express high rating satisfaction telerounding system add usual post-operative care . However , project design address issue patient safety . The purpose study assess difference patient outcomes post-operative patient manage “ standard round ” versus “ telerounding ” . Our primary outcome measure time recognition post-operative morbidity . The telerounding system consist wireless Internet-based videoconferencing device mount remotely control service robot . This study prospective , randomized trial . The study population consist patient schedule laparoscopic radical prostatectomy treatment prostate cancer . Patients undergo schedule surgery receive usual perioperative immediate post-operative care deliver recovery room staff . Once transferred patient floor , intervention patient communicate attend physician daily basis via teleconferencing system . Intervention patient see bedside attend surgeon . The hospital resident staff provide routine daily bedside care . Patients may remove study time request bedside visit attend physician . The intervention conclude either hospital discharge identification major post-operative morbidity . Intervention arm participant participate series focus group . These session serve basis detail qualitative analysis patient perception technology role future health care .</detailed_description>
