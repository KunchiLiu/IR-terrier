	<brief_summary>The rationale transcutaneous vaccination base unique ability cutaneous immune cell , especially Langerhans cell ( LCs ) , present antigen immune system . DCs find high density epidermis dermis human skin , fraction epidermal LCs . It know strong efficient immune response induce target vaccine skin APCs ( Glenn 2003 , Partidos 2003 ) , e.g . epicutaneous application smallpox vaccine scarify skin . Several obstacle however prevent vaccine attain sufficiently high free concentration target skin DCs . In clinical trial aim test safety immunogenicity new transcutaneous route vaccine administration , first license , well-known , safe highly immunogenic vaccine i.e . Tetagrip® vaccine , license subcutaneous ( s.c. ) intra-muscular route ( i.m ) , compare induce vaccine-specific immune response induce conventional ( i.m ) injection . We hypothesize transcutaneous application Tetagrip® commercially available standard preparation 0.5 ml capable induce least similar antibody CD4 and/or CD8 T cell response tetanus flu vaccinal antigen . This Phase I , open label , randomize study design evaluate compare safety immunogenicity transcutaneous mode Tetanus / Influenza vaccination conventional i.m . route vaccine administration two cohort : The cohort I constitute healthy volunteer cohort II HIV-infected patient virus stably control antiretroviral therapy , ensure immune competence capacity respond vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Comparing Vaccine Transcutaneous Administration Intramuscular Route</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study aim translate current knowledge vaccinology , immunology skin transcutaneous penetration epicutaneously apply active compound , development efficient well tolerate vaccine , progress toward easy-to-apply patch system transcutaneous application vaccine . To purpose aim test safety immunogenicity new transcutaneous route vaccine administration . We propose test new route first well-known , safe highly immunogenic vaccine i.e . anti-influenza tetanus vaccine license sub-cutaneous intra-muscular route , compare vaccine-specific immune response induce transcutaneous administration conventional intramuscular ( i.m ) injection . Seasonal vaccination influenza recommend individual risk severe flu , include person 60 year age suffer chronic disease medical personal . It also highly recommended age prevent influenza . In addition vaccination tetanus mandatory childhood require recall injection every 5 year protect lethal disease cause tetanus toxin . We hypothesize transcutaneous application license anti-influenza-tetanus vaccine commercially available standard preparation 0.5 ml capable induce least similar antibody CD4 and/or CD8 T cell response tetanus flu vaccinal antigen . Tetagrip® vaccine approve commercially available vaccine manufacture Sanofi-Pasteur , administer one injection preventive vaccination adult tetanus influenza . The Tetagrip® vaccine therefore represent safe approved test vaccine evaluate safety immunogenicity mode administration investigation . The long term goal strategy improve efficacy vaccine currently encounter major obstacle HIV vaccine , develop non invasive mode vaccine administration . Results study help establish standardize study protocol application HIV-vaccines future clinical trial . STUDY DESIGN This Phase I , open label , randomize vaccine administration route study design evaluate compare safety immunogenicity transcutaneous mode Tetanus / Influenza vaccination conventional i.m . route vaccine administration two cohort : The cohort I constitute healthy volunteer cohort II HIV-infected patient virus stably control antiretroviral therapy , ensure immune competence capacity respond vaccine . This multisite trial conduct Germany two clinical center : Cohort I : Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin Clinical Research Center Hair Skin Physiology Department Dermatology Allergy Schumannstr . 20/21 10117 Berlin , Germany . Cohort II : Hospital Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Frankfurt Main HIV Treatment &amp; Research Unit Department Internal Medicine II Theodor-Stern-Kai 7 60590 Frankfurt Main -Germany</detailed_description>
