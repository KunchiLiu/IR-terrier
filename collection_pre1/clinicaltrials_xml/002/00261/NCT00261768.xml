	<brief_title>Efficacy Digital Noise Reduction Strategies : A Hearing Aid Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first goal project examine efficacy digital hearing aid incorporate three noise reduction strategy ( i.e. , directional microphone alone vs. directional microphone DSP noise reduction algorithm 1 vs. directional microphone DSP noise reduction algorithm 2 ) term speech understand outcome functional outcome . The second goal identify individual characteristic predictive successful functional outcome hear aid . This study employ multi-site , randomize , blind , 2x2 factorial parallel group design . Three hundred subject study three VA Medical Centers ( Mountain Home , TN ; Bay Pines , FL ; Los Angeles , CA ) period three year . Objective ( word recognition ability performance degrade speech stimulus ) subjective ( self-assessment questionnaire , personality depression assessment ) cost-effectiveness assessment measure 4 randomize treatment group receive different digital hearing aid technology . Subjects randomly assign wear hearing aid directional microphone alone directional microphone noise reduction algorithm 1 directional microphone noise reduction algorithm 2 period 8 week . Subjects complete post-testing 8 week hear aid use .</detailed_description>
