	<brief_title>Walking Capacity Parkinson 's Disease ( PD-Walk )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common degenerative neurological condition suffer Australians , 30,000 Australians PD one time ( Parkinson 's Australia ) . Hypokinesia , ie , reduce speed amplitude movement , major impairment motor control affect walk people PD . Over time , development slow , shuffle walk contributes loss independence fall , devastate consequence individual PD family ( Ashburn et al , 2001 , Playfer 2001 ) . Any decrease delay disability reduce personal financial cost individual PD , family , health care resource community . A number previous study suggest exercise capacity exercise habit positively correlate . In people mild Parkinson 's disease ( Canning et al 2005 ) , walk capacity , measure distance walk 6-min walk test , correlate amount walking ( r=.64 , p &lt; 0.01 ) perform week . Similarly , earlier study people mild moderate Parkinson 's disease , regular exercise associate well exercise capacity ( Canning et al 1997 ) . It appear , therefore , proactive intervention aim develop good exercise habit sedentary individual early mid-stage Parkinson 's disease potential reduce delay walk difficulty . This study aim establish efficacy home-based treadmill walk program provide early intervention address primary motor control impairment hypokinesia , time maintain improve exercise capacity .</detailed_description>
