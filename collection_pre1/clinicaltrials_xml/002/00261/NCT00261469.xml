	<brief_title>An Open-label Study Evaluate Topiramate Therapy Migraine Patients , Its Effects Subject Responsiveness Migraine Treatment With Triptans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective pilot study determine patient migraine responsive triptans take symptomatic headache treatment topiramate prophylactic therapy compare baseline period without prophylaxis . The trial open-label design , migraine patient receive topiramate prophylactically twice day ( maximum 200 mg/day ) 16 week , follow 6-week Prospective Baseline Period . During first week treatment phase , subject begin once-daily dose 25 mg topiramate night , remain dose two week . Thereafter , daily dose increase 25 mg , twice-daily dosing . If investigator 's judgement dosage increase beyond 100 mg/day indicate , daily dose increase weekly 25 mg daily dose 150 mg . The daily dose may increase maximum daily dose 200 mg , subject tolerate high dos . Subjects keep headache diary follow information record : time onset headache indication type headache ; time headache stop ; symptomatic treatment take , time tiptan medication take ; headache intensity time triptan take , 30 minute , one hour , two hour post dose ; presence nausea time triptan take , 30 minute , hour , 2 hour post dose . The primary measure triptan responsiveness proportion triptan treat migraine attack pain-free two hour triptan treatment . Safety evaluation study include collection adverse event , laboratory assessment include hematology , chemistry urinalysis , vital sign ( blood pressure pulse ) . The hypothesis topiramate prophylaxis increase responsiveness migraine attack triptan therapy measure proportion attack pain-free two hour triptan therapy . Subjects begin week 1 Topiramate Treatment phase 25 mg topiramate night . Thereafter , dose topiramate increase 25 mg every second week i.e . week 3 = 50 mg , week 5 =75 mg , week 7 = 100 mg . If , investigator 's judgment , dosage increase indicate , dose increase follow : week 9 = 125 mg , week 10 = 150 mg , week 11 = 175 mg , week 12 = 200 mgs.The dose may increase weekly week 10 patient tolerate high .</detailed_description>
