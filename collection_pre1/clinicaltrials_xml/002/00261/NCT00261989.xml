	<brief_title>Pulse Oximetry Readings Hourly Variation Oximetry Readings With CHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital heart disease relatively common disease see 8/1,000 live birth . Many disease associate hypoxemia . Hypoxemia result mix pulmonary systemic blood mix parallel circulation see transposition great vessel . Pulse oximetry use measure hypoxemia . Pulse oximetry estimate oxygen saturation measure absorption light human tissue bed . The amount light absorption varies depend amount deoxygenate blood tissue measure . Measuring change light absorption allow estimation arterial oxygen saturation therefore amount hypoxemia . Most manufacturer claim confidence interval 4 % oximeter . There study recently describe present pulse oximetry know congenital heart disease . However , small study small sample size patient . Moreover , literature describe hourly variation pulse oximetry among know congenital heart disease patient . We hypothesize low presenting pulse oximetry patient congenital heart disease significant variation hourly variation oximetry read patient . This retrospective chart review examine present pulse oximetry patient know cyanotic heart lesion . The treatment group untreated patient know lesion . All chart child present Sibley Heart Center know cyanotic heart lesion January 1 , 2004 December 31 , 2004 reviewed . The aim study describe present pulse oximetry reading patient know lesion cause low oximetry reading . The following information collect chart : - Presenting pulse oximetry - Heart lesion The second aim characterize hourly variation pulse oximetry patient . The following information collect : - Hourly pulse oximetry reading - Heart lesion - Clinical course</detailed_description>
