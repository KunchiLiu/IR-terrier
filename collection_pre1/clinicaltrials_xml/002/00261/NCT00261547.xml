	<brief_title>Rituximab Treatment Block HLA Antibodies Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A long establish risk factor late renal allograft loss development DSA . Recent study group others show antibody probably responsible chronic rejection attack vascular endothelium fix complement ( detect C4d renal biopsy ) . Studies humans monkey show circulate antibody complement deposition precede development chronic graft injury . Interruption antibody production potential beneficial strategy prevent late graft loss mechanism . Therapeutic regimen use attempt deplete HLA ABO antibody include plasmapheresis , IVIg , tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , anti-CD20 ( rituximab ) . Of regimen , specific anti-CD20 , rituximab ( rituxan ) , therapy FDA approve B cell proliferative disease . Although initially introduce treatment neoplasm , humoral immunosuppressant effect rituximab show clinical significance . Rituximab interfere primary secondary humoral response eliminate B-cells prior antigen exposure , thus interfere differentiation antibody secrete cell specific antibody production .</detailed_description>
