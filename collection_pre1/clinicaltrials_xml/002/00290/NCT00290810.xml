	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well bevacizumab work treat patient relapsed refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess treatment success rate Bevacizumab patient relapse refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . II . Assess toxicity associate regimen patient relapse refractory CLL SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess sensitivity apoptosis/cell death residual B-cell clone therapy ( e.g . treatment select resistant clone ) . II . Evaluate risk stratification parameter ( ie immunoglobulin mutational , ZAP-70 , FISH defect /or CD38 status ) correspond baseline apoptosis/cell death rate apoptosis CLL B-cells culture Bevacizumab . III . Examine Bevacizumab synergistic chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil fludarabine . IV . Assess marrow vascularity increase entry study modulate follow therapy Bevacizumab . V. Examine association VEGF plasma level baseline clinical response Bevacizumab . VI . Examine level VCAM entry study treatment Bevacizumab . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
