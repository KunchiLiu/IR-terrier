	<brief_summary>This proposal seek retain `` discard '' piece human gynecologic tissue `` discard '' ascites fluid collect normal surgical procedure , along correspond blood sample urine , research involve prognostic marker disease/cancer . The specific aim proposal include : 1 . To collect `` discard '' piece benign , pre-malignant malignant gynecologic tissue , `` discard '' ascites fluid , possible , correspond blood urine specimens patient undergo : 1. hysterectomy 2. excision cervical dysplasia and/or venereal wart , 3. therapeutic excisional surgery remove gynecologic disease/cancer ( uterine , ovarian low female genital tract ) . 4. paracentesis symptomatic relief ascites fluid accumulation ( distention ) . 2 . To collect pre-operative blood urine patient along pre- operative blood work drawn clinical evaluation . 3 . De-identify patient donate tissue , blood urine specimens assign laboratory identification number . 4 . Rapidly process store collect specimen preserve biological integrity . ( RNA , DNA proteins ) 5 . Collect record patient 's demographic medical information research database assign lab number . 6 . Assess specimens prognostic marker gynecologic disease/cancer molecular technique DNA array , immunohistochemistry ELISA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During last two decade , cancer research shift use cell line animal model directly use human tissue . This especially true research focus premalignancies good animal model . Research utilizing human tissue sera address many issues/questions medical research evaluate cell line and/or animal model human disease , also provide system test relevance finding human disease . Various biologic genetic change occur developmental stage human neoplasia identify analyze use human tissue . Research use human tissue sera make great stride effort define possible marker develop neoplasia promote design target cancer treatment possible prevention . It important link research finding tissue blood specimen clinical outcome patient malignancy pinpoint , course cancer development , molecular change occur . Many malignancy female genital tract may arise one location , either synchronously metachronously , give rise concept `` field '' effect carcinogenesis . By collect tissue multiple epithelial site ( sampled physician ) possible compare molecular change see preinvasive occur invasive neoplasia differential expression profile potential marker . If protein marker identify cell present diseased tissue check patient 's serum urine see protein detect . This information enable u screen possibly identify protein marker patient serum urine correlate presence premalignant malignant state . Malignant ascites excess fluid accumulate space membrane line abdomen abdominal organ , otherwise know peritoneal , abdominal cavity . Malignant ascites typically occurs disease , infection , cancer peritoneal cavity produce excessive fluid . Ascites fluid accumulation common gynecologic cancer , especially ovarian . If protein marker identify cell present diseased ascites fluid may able correlate marker metastasis disease/cancer possibly help prevent spread several gynecologic cancer .</detailed_description>
