	<brief_title>Gleevec Administered Preoperatively Reduce Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor ( GIST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) specific , immunohistochemically KIT+ mesenchymal neoplasm gastrointestinal tract . The identification KIT+ tumor become important introduction target treatment KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec ) . Despite progress , GIST patient present tumor large 5 cm 10 year survival 10 % 30 % . Indeed , risk microscopic spread tumor surgery high since intra-abdominal organ close relation others . To improve survival , seem logical use preoperative Gleevec reduce tumor size improve efficacy surgical procedure .</detailed_description>
