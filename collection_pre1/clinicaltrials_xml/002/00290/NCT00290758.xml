	<brief_title>Genistein Preventing Breast Cancer Women High Risk Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine effect genistein proliferation breast epithelial cell obtain fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) , measure Ki-67 label index , woman high risk breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine effect drug cellular molecular parameter use epithelial cell obtain FNA , nipple aspirate fluid , blood patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratify accord menopausal status ( premenopausal v postmenopausal ) history breast cancer ( history breast cancer v history estrogen receptor [ ER ] positive breast cancer v history ER negative breast cancer ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral genistein daily . ARM II : Patients receive oral placebo daily . In arm , treatment continue 6 month absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30-37 day .</detailed_description>
