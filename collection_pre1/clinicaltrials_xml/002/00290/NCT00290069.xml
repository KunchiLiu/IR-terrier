	<brief_summary>The main aim study compare renal function ( serum creatinine 6 month ) later introduction tacrolimus rapamycin base immunosuppressor regime daclizumab , mycophenolate mofetil , steroids patient older 50 year age recipients graft donor age 55 year old .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Renal Function Optimization With Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) Immunosuppressor Regimes ( ALHAMBRA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population characteristic raise need establish treatment regime assure suitable intensity immunosuppression avoid appearance rejection episode , minimize dos prevent over-immunosuppression population theoretic minor immune response . On hand , delay introduction calcineurin inhibitor prevent increase risk early graft dysfunction allow high post-transplant renal recovery organ less operative mass great sensibility nephrotoxic effect drug . The result several study confirm goodness regime include low dos calcineurin inhibitor , delay introduction avoid . Nevertheless , although standard practice evaluate effectiveness regime time assure , certainty , response treatment , follow-up still relatively short assure efficacy long-term study detect problem . The study high number patient long follow-up period difficult , several author propose different alternative control short-term study could useful surrogate marker predictive efficacy variable long term . If drug study regime efficient , observed change transplantation surgery fast objective . The increase serum creatinine 6 12 month post-transplant reliable marker graft failure risk , magnitude serum creatinine change month marker relationship long-term survival . For reason , renal function ( serum creatinine ) include main efficacy variable .</detailed_description>
