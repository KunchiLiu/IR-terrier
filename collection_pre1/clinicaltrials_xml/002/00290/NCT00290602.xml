	<brief_title>Early Low Dose Steroid Therapy Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) develop thoracic surgery usually lethal complication . The use corticosteroid ARDS subject great controversy debate year . Unfortunately , trial short-term , high-dose steroid therapy fail show improvement mortality patient risk , early , ARDS . Several investigator suggest use corticosteroid late fibroproliferative phase ARDS improve lung function survival . Recently author demonstrate potential pulmonary fibroproliferation early stage ARDS use low-dose corticosteroid early stage find lead complete maintenance vivo vitro respiratory mechanic acute lung injury . These article important implication study repair mechanism time therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . ARDS , define acute onset : PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 . Bilateral infiltrates . The infiltrates may patchy , diffuse , homogeneous , asymmetric , consistent pulmonary edema fibrotic change fibroproliferation . Opacities due pleural effusion atelectasis consider . If pneumonectomy , unilateral infiltrate include . No evidence leave atrial hypertension . If measure , PAWP ≤ 18 mmHg . Criteria ac must occur together within 24hour interval . The first date criterion meet defined onset ARDS 2 . Since ARDS onset , chest infiltrates must progressive , chest compute tomographic scan finding consistent postoperative ARDS finding ground glass opacity radiologists . 3 . Major thoracic surgery Lung cancer ; pneumonectomy , extend pneumonectomy , lobectomy , sleeve lobectomy , extend lobectomy , wedge resection . Esophageal cancer ; IvorLewis operation , transhiatal esophagectomy , McKeown operation . Metastatic lung cancer ; simultaneous bilateral metastasectomy . 4 . PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 day ESTART enrollment . 1 . Clinical evidence active untreated infection . Clarifications : A know , undrained abscess ( e.g . Staphylococcal lung abscess loculated empyema intraabdominal abscess ) know intravascular nidus infection ( e.g. , bacterial fungal endocarditis ) basis exclusion , even treat antibiotic . A bacterial infection treat standard antibiotic regimen would basis exclusion . Disseminated fungal infection , even treat , exclusion . Ongoing septic shock , even antibiotic basis exclusion . 2 . Age &lt; 18 year . 3 . Pregnancy . 4 . Burns require skin grafting . 5 . Patients AIDS CDC criterion , diagnose either documented AIDS defining illness CD4 &lt; 200 ( see Appendix F ) ; prednisolone therapy &gt; =300mg ( equivalent ) cumulative dose within 21 day prior enrollment , &gt; 15mg/day ( equivalent ) within 7 day prior enrollment ; cytotoxic therapy within 3 week . 6 . Other irreversible chronic disease condition 6 month mortality estimate ≥ 50 % . 7 . Not commit full support . 8 . Severe chronic liver disease ( ChildPugh Class C score &gt; 10 point ) . 9 . Transplant patient exception autologous bone marrow transplant . 10 . Extracorporeal support gas exchange time study entry ( e.g. , ECMO ) . 11 . Known suspected adrenal insufficiency . 12 .
