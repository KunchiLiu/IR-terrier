	<brief_title>CCI-779 Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine complete partial response rate patient recurrent refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia treat CCI-779 . II . Determine toxicity safety drug patient . III . Correlate degree activation P13/AKT/mTOR pathway level CDK inhibitor response patient treated drug . IV . Correlate CCI-779 induced inactivation mTOR response patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease ( aggressive lymphoma [ group A ] v follicular lymphoma [ group B ] v small lymphocytic lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia [ group C ] ) . Patients receive CCI-779 IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 8 week .</detailed_description>
