	<brief_title>Rituximab Plus Beta-Glucan Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) /Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( SLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) common form leukemia adult . CLL cancer B-lymphocytes , make antibody help protect body harmful foreign substance , bacteria virus . Similar CLL , small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) less-common cancer B-lymphocytes . In SLL , abnormal lymphocyte mainly affect lymph node ; CLL , abnormal lymphocyte mainly affect blood bone marrow . Current drug therapy CLL/SLL known increase severity pre-existing low blood cell count , turn increase risk infection patient . Research improve safety effectiveness CLL/SLL therapy currently ongoing . One therapy investigate Rituximab . Rituximab type drug know therapeutic antibody . Therapeutic antibody laboratory-created substance attach onto protein surface cell . After bind cell , therapeutic antibody block growth tumor and/or trigger body 's immune system attack target , also sensitize cancer cell chemotherapy . Rituximab approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment CLL/SLL . Beta-Glucan ( Imucell WGP ) over-the-counter dietary supplement enhance body 's immune system . ImucellTM WGP extract food-grade baker 's yeast , permit use food FDA . Animal study show Imucell WGP help trigger white blood cell destroy cancer cell . Other animal study combine Rituximab Imucell WGP show great tumor regression tumor-free survival .</detailed_description>
