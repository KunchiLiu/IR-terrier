	<brief_summary>Many thousand trauma patient see Canadian emergency department year . On rare occasion , patient break neck ( cervical spine fracture ) 98 percent case xrays order doctor normal . The total cost inexpensive high volume test neck x-rays add considerably rise health care cost . In addition , patient often immobilize uncomfortable backboard collar many hour , tie valuable space time crowd emergency department . This research group recently develop test highly accurate reliable guideline call Canadian C-Spine Rule help physician much selective use neck x-rays minimize period immobilization . This research project evaluate true effectiveness Rule implement simple inexpensive measure . This study involve 14,000 patient 12 busy emergency department across Canada . This Canadian C-Spine Rule design allow physician much selective use neck xrays without risk miss fracture dislocation neck reduce length time immobilization . Widespread use guideline could lead large saving health care system without jeopardize patient could greatly expedite care trauma patient crowd emergency department .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementation Canadian C-Spine Rule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Physicians Canadian emergency department ( EDs ) annually treat 185,000 alert stable trauma victim risk cervical spine ( c-spine ) injury . Only 0.9 % patient , however , suffer cervical spine fracture . Current use radiography efficient . More 98 % c-spine radiograph negative considerable variation among hospital physician radiography use . C-spine radiographs little ticket item , low cost procedure significantly add health care cost due high volume . In addition , alert stable trauma patient often immobilized backboard rigid collar sandbag many hour . This lead considerable patient discomfort unnecessary use valuable time space crowd EDs . This renewal application build previous MRC/CIHR grant determine feasibility ( phase 0 , MRC GR-13304D , 1995-96 ) , develop decision rule c-spine radiography ( phase I , MRC MT-13700 , 1996-99 , N=8,924 ) , prospectively validate Canadian C-Spine Rule ( phase II , CIHR MT13700 , 1999-2002 , N=8,000 ) , part University Ottawa Group Grant Decision Support Techniques ( CIHR 2000-143 ) . The Canadian C-Spine Rule comprise simple clinical variable ( Figure 1 ) allow physician much selective order radiography ( JAMA 2001 ) . In recently complete prospective validation ( phase II ) , confirm accuracy reliability rule . Objectives : The goal phase III evaluate effectiveness safety active strategy implement Canadian C-Spine Rule physician practice . Specific objective : 1 ) Determine clinical impact compare intervention control sit : ) C-spine radiography rate , b ) Missed fracture , c ) Serious adverse outcome , ) Length stay ED , e ) Patient satisfaction ; 2 ) Determine sustainability impact ; 3 ) Evaluate performance Canadian C-Spine Rule , regard : ) Accuracy , b ) Physician accuracy interpretation , c ) Physician comfort compliance use ; 4 ) Conduct economic evaluation determine potential cost saving widespread implementation . Methods : We propose matched-pair cluster design study compare outcomes 3 consecutive 12-month , , decay period 6 pair intervention control sit ( Figure 3 ) . These 12 hospital ED sit stratify teach community hospital , match accord baseline c-spine radiography order rate , allocate within pair either intervention control group . During period intervention site , simple inexpensive strategy employ actively implement Canadian C-Spine Rule : ) physician group discussion consensus , b ) educational initiative ( lecture , poster , pocket card ) , c ) process-of-care modification mandatory reminder Rule point requisition radiography . These outcome assess : 1 ) Measures clinical impact compare change intervention control site : ) C-spine radiography order proportion ( primary analysis ) ; b ) Number missed fracture ; c ) Number serious adverse outcome ; ) Length stay ED ; e ) Patient satisfaction . 2 ) Performance Canadian C-Spine Rule : ) Accuracy rule ; b ) Physician accuracy interpretation ; c ) Physician comfort compliance . 3 ) Economic evaluation measure : ) Radiography rate discharge ; b ) Length stay ED hospital ; c ) Hospital admission ; ) Operative repair . During 12-month decay period , implementation strategy continue , allow u evaluate sustainability effect . We estimate sample size 4,800 patient period order adequate power evaluate main outcome . Importance : This implementation study ( phase III ) essential step process develop new clinical decision rule guideline health care practitioner . Phase I successfully derive Canadian C-Spine Rule phase II confirm accuracy safety rule , hence , potential physician improve care . What remain unknown actual change clinical behaviour effect implementation Canadian C-Spine Rule whether implementation achieve simple inexpensive measure . We believe Canadian C-Spine Rule potential significantly reduce health care cost improve efficiency patient flow busy Canadian EDs .</detailed_description>
