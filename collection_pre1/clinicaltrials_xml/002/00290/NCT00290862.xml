	<brief_summary>Doctors study investigational treatment use vertebroplasty procedure treat vertebral compression fracture ( spine fracture ) may help reduce pain restore mobility . If one experience back pain least 4 week longer 1 year , he/she may eligible participate . The purpose protocol describe method clinical evaluation Cortoss vertebroplasty patient painful osteoporotic compression fracture . Eligible patient painful osteoporotic compression fracture spine divide two group . Each enrol patient vertebroplasty procedure ; however one group patient vertebroplasty procedure use polymethylmethacrylate [ PMMA ] ( Food Drug Administration [ FDA ] -approved bone cement ) group patient vertebroplasty procedure use relatively new ( investigational ) biomaterial call Cortoss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Treatment Painful Vertebral Compression Fractures Caused Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center randomized , control study design evaluate safety effectiveness Cortoss® Synthetic Cortical Bone Void Filler vertebral augmentation use percutaneous vertebroplasty technique . Study eligible patient painful osteoporotic compression fracture randomize ( 2:1 ) vertebroplasty Cortoss ( treatment group ) PMMA ( control group ) , respectively . Patients tell treatment receive ( single blind study design ) . Safety effectiveness determine compare success rate treatment group success rate control group . Secondary endpoint include Quality Life , Patient satisfaction , evaluation patient 's pain function post-operatively compare baseline , maintenance vertebral body height alignment . For purpose study , vertebral augmentation , vertebroplasty , define minimally invasive procedure utilize manual instrument radiological guidance deliver in-situ polymerizable material stabilize collapse fractured vertebral body . The goal alleviate pain cause fracture enhance prevent deterioration function . This multi-center study evaluate Cortoss augmentation one two vertebra ( e ) , fracture result osteoporosis , locate ( include ) level sixth thoracic fifth lumbar vertebra . A total 243 patient enrol 19 site . All subject must radiographic evidence vertebral body fracture due osteoporosis . After comply eligibility criterion , subject sign inform consent document randomize vertebroplasty treatment Cortoss PMMA ( 1:1 ratio ) . Patients follow least 24 month recruitment expect take 9 12 month . Visits assessment plan accord time event schedule .</detailed_description>
