	<brief_summary>Surgical repair full thickness tear rotator cuff controversial issue , several procedure currently use treat tear . The two common treatment point time arthroscopic cuff repair without acromioplasty . However , arthroscopic cuff repair without acromioplasty may offer degree improvement one include acromioplasty , without threaten shoulder stability provide acromion coracoacromial ligament .

	<detailed_description>There exist controversy current trend repair full thickness tear rotator cuff . The two common treatment point time arthroscopic cuff repair without acromioplasty . The purpose acromioplasty create adequate space rotator cuff tendon . Arthroscopic acromioplasty involves removal subacromial bursa , resection coracoacromial ligament anteroinferior portion acromion , resection osteophyte acromioclavicular joint thought contribute impingement . However , acromioplasty without cuff repair report good poor result , show technique may suspect repair full thickness tear alone . The purpose study compare effectiveness arthroscopic cuff repair acromioplasty arthroscopic cuff repair without acromioplasty repair full thickness tear rotator cuff . We hypothesize significant clinical improvement quality life patient receive rotator cuff repair without acromioplasty compare receive cuff repair acromioplasty .</detailed_description>
