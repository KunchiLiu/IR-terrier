	<brief_summary>This investigational study assess objective overall response ( OOR ) rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) imatinib mesylate hydroxyurea ( hydroxycarbamide ) combination therapy patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( brain tumor ) . This study also evaluate duration tumor response ( per MacDonald criterion ) , clinical benefit , progression-free survival rate 6 12 month , survival rate 12 24 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This ClinicalTrials.gov record include result two study ( Novartis protocol IDs CSTI571H2201 CSTI571H2202 ) conduct separately report together single clinical study report . Both study phase II , open-label , multicenter , single-arm study evaluate efficacy imatinib mesylate plus hydroxyurea subject progressive glioblastoma multiforme . The study identical design two exception : Patients study CSTI571H2201 receive dose imatinib 600 mg daily allow concomitant use enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug ( EIACDs ) ; patient study CSTI571H2202 receive dose imatinib 500 mg twice daily allow concomitant use EIACDs .</detailed_description>

Sexuallyactive male female patient require use doublebarrier contraception ( oral contraceptive plus barrier contraceptive ) must undergo clinically document total hysterectomy , ovariectomy , tubal ligation . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 48 hour prior start study drug . Life expectancy ≥ 8 week . Signed informed consent patient prior patient entry study procedure . Receipt imatinib hydroxyurea ( HU ) prior study entry receipt investigational agent within last 6 month . Patients receive second course chemotherapy radiotherapy , unless give single localized application radio surgery . In study STI571H2201 , receipt enzymeinducing anticonvulsant drug ( EIACDs ) , eg , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , fosphenytoin , oxcarbazepine , primidone . Previous EIACD interrupt 4 week prior study start . Grade ≥ 2 peripheral edema pulmonary pericardial effusion ascites grade . Presence uncontrolled systemic infection . Patients minimum 12 week completion conventional external beam radiotherapy unless : 1 . There new radiographical enhancement outside field radiation , 2 . There new pathological confirmation recurrent tumor , 3 . Progressive radiographical enhancement note postradiotherapy/TMZ continue worsen additional course TMZ . Evidence intratumor hemorrhage pretreatment diagnostic imaging , except stable postoperative Grade 1 hemorrhage , patient excessive risk intracranial hemorrhagic event , patient history central nervous system ( exclude postoperative Grade 1 ) intraocular bleed . Patients undergone major surgery within 2 week prior study entry recover prior major surgery , patient receive chemotherapy within 4 week prior study start , recover toxic effect therapy . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease could significantly alter absorption imatinib . Patients take warfarin sodium . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) seropositivity ; test HIV require study entry . For purpose MRI , patient pacemaker , ferromagnetic metal implant approve safe use MR scanner ( eg , type aneurysm clip , shrapnel ) , patient suffer uncontrollable claustrophobia , physically unable fit machine ( eg , obesity ) . Patients consider investigator unlikely compliant study , take study medication , travel necessary assessment visit , medical condition likely interfere study assessment .
