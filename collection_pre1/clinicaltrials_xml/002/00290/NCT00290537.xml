	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn drug ZD6474 affect amount tumor cell death body amount blood supply tumor . The safety ZD6474 alone give chemotherapy study . In addition , side effect response treatment also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study ZD6474 Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ZD6474 new investigational drug think block formation new blood vessel . The growth new blood vessel call angiogenesis . Angiogenesis think essential growth tumor beyond small size . It hop ZD6474 limit new blood vessel growth tumor `` starve '' tumor limit blood flow . The second part study also include paclitaxel ( Taxol ) carboplatin ( Paraplatin ) . Both paclitaxel carboplatin standard chemotherapy drug approve FDA use treatment lung cancer . Before begin treatment study , biopsy tumor . The tissue take biopsy compare tissue take receive ZD6474 . The tumor sample compare see effect ZD6474 tumor cell death . During biopsy procedure , receive either local general anesthetic depend location tumor small piece tumor remove large needle . Before treatment start , complete physical exam physician . You routine blood ( 4 teaspoon ) urine test . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . You chest x-ray CT MRI scan , functional MRI , bone scan doctor think necessary , brain scan . You also ECG ( test measure electrical activity heart ) ECHO scan make sure heart healthy enough receive treatment . Treatment study give 3-week cycle . During first three cycle ( i.e. , first 9 week ) take ZD6474 tablet mouth morning empty stomach . While study receive physical exam every week . You also receive weekly blood test ( 4 teaspoon ) first 4 week treatment . After receive blood test ( 4 teaspoon ) every 3-week cycle . After 2 week treatment another biopsy tumor , another functional MRI . After every 9 week treatment every 2 cycle thereafter repeat CT MRI evaluate tumor . If disease respond ZD6474 stay , go second part study . If disease gotten worse intolerable side effect occur , take study doctor discus treatment option . If continue second part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) receive either : ) daily ZD6474 alone , b ) paclitaxel carboplatin every 3 week along daily ZD6474 . You equal chance assign either group . If receive paclitaxel , receive 3-hour infusion vein first day treatment cycle . If receive carboplatin , receive vein immediately follow paclitaxel infusion . The carboplatin infusion take 15 30 minute . Treatment either daily ZD6474 ZD6474 plus paclitaxel carboplatin continue disease worsens severe side effect occur . This investigational study . ZD6474 investigational drug approve FDA research use . A total 120 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

Patients must &gt; = 18 year age . 1 . Patients exclude receive prior chemotherapy disease type . 2 . Patients brain metastasis eligible study unless treat least 4 week entry stable without steroid treatment 1 week . 3 . Prior radiation therapy allow &lt; 25 % bone marrow . Prior radiation whole pelvis allow . Prior radiotherapy must complete least 4 week study enrollment . Patients must recover acute toxic effect treatment prior study enrollment . 4 . Patients may concomitant uncontrolled medical psychiatric disorder . 5 . Patients must pregnant breastfeeding . All woman childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test . Childbearing potential defined woman menses within past 12 month , tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy . There specific information available effect drug woman pregnant breastfeeding . Therefore patient exclude study unknown risk involve . All sexually active patient must practice adequate contraception entire treatment period . 6 . Patients must undergo minor surgery ( e.g. , central venous catheter placement ) within 24 hour treatment ZD6474 . Patients may undergo major surgery ( e.g. , laparotomy , thoracotomy , craniotomy ) within four week enrollment . 7 . Patients may history bleed diathesis . 8 . Patients must agree use herbal remedy overthecounter biologics ( e.g. , shark cartilage ) 9 . Significant cardiac event ( include symptomatic heart failure angina ) within 3 month entry presence cardiac disease opinion Investigator increase risk ventricular arrythmia . 10 . History clinically significant arrhythmia ( multifocal PVCs , bigeminy , trigeminy , ventricular tachycardia ) symptomatic require treatment ( CTC grade 3 ) asymptomatic sustain ventricular tachycardia . Atrial fibrillation , control medication exclude . 11 . Presence leave bundle branch block ( LBBB ) . 12 . Previous history QT prolongation result medication require discontinuation medication . 13 .
