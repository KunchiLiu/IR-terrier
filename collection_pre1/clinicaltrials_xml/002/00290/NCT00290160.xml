	<brief_title>Early Protein Supplementation Prevention Hyperkalemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized double blind prospective clinical trial . All infant admit University Hospital neonatal intensive care unit birth weight &lt; 1000 gram , mmore 24 week gestation congenital anomaly enrol study . This include inborn infant transport outlying hospital admit &lt; 12 hour life . After informed consent , infant randomize receive either standard care nutritional management nutritional management per study protocol addition protein supplementation . Randomization take place pharmacy . Control Group : Infants enrol control group start intravenous fluid ( IVF ) admission NICU 5 % Dextrose 1500 mg calcium gluconate per 500 cc total fluid intake either 120 150 cc/kg/day . The attend neonatologist accordance infant 's gestational age maturity make decision regard total fluid intake . The control group start 0.5 gram/kg/d protein ( Amynosin PF ) DOL 1 increase 0.5 gram/kg/day every day maximum 3 grams/kg/day . Study group : The study group receive total fluid intake ( 120 cc/kg/day 150 cc/kg/day ) 5 % dextrose infusion calcium gluconate addition 2 grams/kg/day protein ( Aminosyn PF ) . The study group receive 2 grams/kg/day protein 24 hour 36 hour increase 1 gram/kg/day maximum 4 grams/kg/day . In group , caloric intake start 29-34 kcal/kg day ( i.e. , approximately 20-25 calorie per kilogram glucose 9 calorie per kilogram lipid ) . Caloric intake progressively increase depend infant 's tolerance glucose . Protein glucose ratio control group 250-312 nitrogen balance ratio ( include calorie ) approximately 362-425 . In study group , protein glucose ratio 64-80 nitrogen balance ratio ( include calorie ) 93-109 . The control group correspond current standard care . The study group nitrogen balance within limit recent study show nitrogen balance ratio 46-78 appropriate ELBW infant . Glucose infusion rate ( GIR ) increase attend neonatologist depend infant 's glucose tolerance . Usually GIR start 6 mg/kg/min increase 1 milligram per kilo per minute every 24 hr . ELBW infant . For fluctuation glucose , adjustment glucose infusion rate ( GIR ) via piggyback dextrose IVF necessary . Lipids supply 20 % solution start attend neonatologist accord standard care ( 0.5-1 gr/kg first day life , increase 0.5-1 gr/kg per day maximum 3 gr/kg day ) . All infant start Total Parenteral Nutrition ( TPN ) DOL 1 . The amino acid solution ( Aminosyn PF ) supplement 40 mg cysteine hydrochloride/kg/day group since consider one essential amino acid premature infant . Stable isotope study suggest improved protein retention cysteine supplementation . 3 The amino acid solution add via pharmacy per study protocol . Subjects continue receive supplementation first week life . Initiation feeding , TPN , fluid , electrolyte intake determine attend neonatologist . If infant develops hyperkalemia ( &gt; 6.5 mmol/lt ) , treatment determine attend neonatologist base standard care incluiding : increase intravenous fluid delivery , diuretic therapy ( lasix ) , correction acidosis , close monitoring ionized total calcium level correction calcium gluconate need , glucose insulin infusion , kayexalate , refractory , exchange transfusion might consider . Following completion study , continue monitor standard laboratory data , include serum urine electrolyte . We also monitor growth hospital discharge . Following discharge , infant follow PREMIEre clinic neurodevelopmental outcome Bayley test 6 , 12 , 18 month CGA . In addition primary outcome reduction incidence hyperkalemia , secondary outcome interest include incidence hyperglycemia , incidence periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage ( PIVH ) , renal function , growth , neurodevelopmental outcome 18 month correct gestational age .</detailed_description>
