	<brief_summary>This study want address question whether oral alimentation begin early patient follow colorectal surgery compare classical diet depend reappearance functional intestinal transit . Early oral alimentation follow colorectal surgery may decrease hospitalisation stay duration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Alimentation Following Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following intestinal surgery , classical protocol indicate use naso-gastric tube starvation less prolonged patient dependent surgeon 's view . Decision fee patient base gas feces reappearance surgery . However , prolonged starvation might uncomfortable patient well increase hospitalization stay . Moreover , delay feed effect anastomosis wound heal controversial naso-gastric tube use know uncomfortable may generate secondary adverse event . Some study open surgery observe early alimentation beneficial post-surgery mortality , infection risk anastomosis dehiscence . In addition , early feeding seem decrease patient hospitalisation stay . In order conduct study , patient colorectal surgery randomly attribute nil per o group , base reappearance functional intestinal transit , experimental group , begin alimentation 12 hour colorectal surgery .</detailed_description>
