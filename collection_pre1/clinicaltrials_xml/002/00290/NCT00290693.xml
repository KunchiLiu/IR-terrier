	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give capecitabine together docetaxel work treat patient recurrent progressive metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Docetaxel Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine overall ( complete partial ) response rate patient recurrent progressive metastatic pancreatic cancer treat capecitabine docetaxel . Secondary - Determine overall progression-free survival patient treat chemotherapy combination . - Determine duration response ( complete partial ) among patient attain response . - Determine frequency patient &gt; 50 % fall CA19-9 initial level &gt; 100 U/mL association treatment regimen . - Evaluate toxicity associate administration combination patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label , nonrandomized study . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 45 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
