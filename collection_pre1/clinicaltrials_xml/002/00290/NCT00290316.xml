	<detailed_description>The incidence hepatocellular carcinoma increase US . The reason increase attribute emergence hepatitis C. Studies suggest patient hepatitis C high risk develop hepatocellular carcinoma ( elevated alpha-fetoprotein ) , therefore undergo periodic radiological investigation . The liver also common site metastasis various malignancy . The metastasis liver profoundly affect management prognosis , since patient advanced cancer therefore candidate surgery . 1.1 Current standard care For primary liver tumor alpha-fetoprotein , abdominal ultrasound CT scan abdomen suggest test screen patient high risk develop complication . Measurement serum alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) may helpful diagnosis management HCC . AFP elevate 20 ng/Ml 70 % patient HCC . However , AFP elevations 10-500 ng/Ml even occasionally 1000 ng/ml may see patient high degree inflammatory activity chronic viral hepatitis , HCC ( 3 ) . The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value AFP 3 well perform screen study HCC range 39 % -64 % , 76 % -91 % , 9 % -32 % , respectively ( 4 ) . Imaging study play key role diagnosis HCC since significant number case miss AFP . CT scan magnetic resonance image commonly use test . On basis study conduct last two decade , National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( 2004 ) guideline management cancer recommend CT scan evaluation liver metastasis ( Please refer appendix III ) . Recent study show CT scan far ideal detection primary well metastases liver ( 5,6 ) . A well design study show CT scan miss 32 % primary tumor liver . A prospective study 100 patient colorectal cancer show CT scan miss liver metastasis 37 % case ( 5 ) . Another prospective control study 135 subject show CT scan fail detect liver metastases 49 % patient various malignancy ( 6 ) . 1.2 EUS possible diagnostic tool liver tumor EUS well-established tool diagnosis and/ stag esophageal , gastric pancreatic cancer . Recent study show potential role EUS liver imaging ( 7 , 8 , 9 ) . 1.3 Comparison EUS CT scan detection liver metastases Studies suggest EUS may attractive alternative CT scan detection liver metastasis , since detect lesion miss CT scan ( 9 ) . EUS detect metastatic lesion overlook conventional , cross-sectional imaging study 5 222 case ( 2.3 % ) ( 9 ) . Another study find occult liver metastasis 2.4 % 574 patient suspect GI pulmonary malignancy ( 4 ) . Each patient find occult metastasis EUS stag CT , raise issue quality and/or interpretation study . An additional advantage EUS fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) perform simultaneously therefore confirmation malignancy usually accomplish single procedure whereas CT US typically require 2 session accomplish task , one detection another FNA . 1.4 Limitation EUS : Right lobe The limitation EUS able examine right lobe liver completely . 1.5 Rationale study . The diagnostic accuracy EUS detection liver tumor ( primary metastatic ) remain unknown . There sufficient evidence suggest EUS may superior CT scan liver metastasis . Studies evaluate role EUS limit small sample size retrospective design . Therefore , prospective study adequate sample size require determine diagnostic accuracy endoscopy ultrasound . 2.0 Objectives : 2.1 Primary : To compare accuracy EUS CT scan detection primary metastatic carcinoma liver . 2.2 Secondary : 2.2.1 Determine diagnostic yield fine needle aspiration use EUS ( EUS-FNA ) patient suspect liver metastasis EUS examination . 2.2.2 Compare accuracy PET scan EUS detection liver metastasis . 2.2.3 Determine safety EUS-FNA subject liver lesion . 2.2.4 Impact EUS management hepatocellular carcinoma 2.2.5 To study characteristic echoendoscopic finding primary secondary liver tumor . 2.3 Hypothesis : 2.3.1 EUS likely detect primary tumor liver metastasis subject normal CT scan . 3.0 Design : This prospective study study group would comprise consecutive patient newly diagnose colon , pancreatic , esophageal , lung , gastric cancer patient hepatitis C B elevate level alpha-fetoprotein radiological finding suggestive mass liver . Patients would select gastroenterology clinic , primary care clinic , surgery clinic , sub-specialty clinic ( Oncology , Pulmonary ) hepatitis C clinic . These clinic would inform ongoing EUS study eligibility criterion â€™ study . All patient see gastroenterology clinic detail description EUS-FNA procedure would provide . In addition , patient would provide consent form . ( Please refer section 5 detail consent process . ) Study population : Enrollment participant . Patients enrol study would undergo - - Detailed history physical examination , - CT-abdomen preferably contrast , - Possible PET scan . PET scan perform patient evident distant metastasis . - Intervention allocation : eligible patient would encourage undergo EUS EUS-FNA examination . Intervention : Description schedule : All eligible patient would undergo EUS examination liver . Any subject abnormality suspicious malignancy liver would undergo FNA . Follow-up visit description schedule . After procedure patient would refer back clinic patient identify management . These patient usually see oncologist , pulmonologists cardio-thoracic surgeon depend stage medical condition patient .</detailed_description>
