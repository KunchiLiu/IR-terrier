	<brief_title>D-Cycloserine Augmentation Exposure Response Prevention Treatment Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exposure response prevention ( ERP ) proven efficacy OCD treatment adult . Yet , ERP help individual , benefit often remain somewhat symptomatic . Behavioral model OCD treatment base two component . First , fear acquire development association neutral stimulus aversive stimulus former acquires aversive property latter . The neutral stimulus designate conditioned stimulus ( CS ) , original aversive stimulus call unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) . Second , acquire fear unlearned presentation CS absence UCS , process know extinction . On neural level , ERP incorporate similar mechanism involve fear conditioning . Antagonists glutamatergic NMDA receptor , involve learning memory , block fear learn extinction . D-Cycloserine ( DCS ) , partial agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) glutamate receptor subtype , augments learn animal human . Clinical application animal human suggest DCS facilitates fear extinction process take prior exposure fear stimulus . An initial trial acrophobic adult provide support acute DCS dose facilitate extinction fear . Given ERP base extinction , follow DCS may augment ERP therapy provide enhanced treatment effect . With mind , propose undertake initial study DCS determine whether short-term clinical benefit add standard ERP therapy adult OCD .</detailed_description>
