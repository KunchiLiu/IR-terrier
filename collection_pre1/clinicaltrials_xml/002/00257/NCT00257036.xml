	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Oral Levofloxacin Compared With Oral Ciprofloxacin Treatment Adults With Mild Moderate Infections Skin Supportive Layers Beneath Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levofloxacin antibacterial agent use treatment many type infection adult . This randomized , open-label , parallel group , multicenter study determine safety effectiveness levofloxacin ( 500 mg mouth daily 7-10 day ) compare another frequently use antibiotic , ciprofloxacin ( 500 mg mouth every 12 hour 7 -10 day ) , adult mild moderate infection skin supportive layer beneath skin . The study consist 3 visit : one visit [ pre-therapy ] screening enrollment , two visit assess safety effectiveness ( one visit [ on-therapy ] Days 3 - 5 study one visit [ post-therapy ] 2 - 7 day last dose study drug ) . The total duration patient participation study approximately 2 week . The primary assessment effectiveness include clinical response treatment ( define post-therapy cured , improve fail ) microbiological response post-therapy ( rate eradication disease-causing bacteria , determine patient type bacteria ) . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , physical examination , physical examination skin , laboratory test ) perform throughout study . The study hypothesis treatment levofloxacin least effective well tolerate treatment ciprofloxacin patient mild moderate infection skin supportive layer beneath skin . Levofloxacin 500 mg mouth daily , ciprofloxacin 500 mg mouth every 12 hour . The duration treatment 7 10 day .</detailed_description>
