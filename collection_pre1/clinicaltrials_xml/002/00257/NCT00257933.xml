	<detailed_description>Practice guideline management asthma child universally recommend systemic corticosteroid treatment moderate severe asthma exacerbation . However , guideline vary widely respect dose , frequency , method delivery , duration therapy . In actual practice , also considerable variation among clinician term corticosteroid dose child hospitalize asthma exacerbation . At Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) current standard use initial dose 4.0 mg/kg/day ( 1.0 mg/kg every 6 hour maximum 30 mg/dose ) although many pediatric hospital use 2.0 mg/kg/day dose ( 1.0 mg/kg every 12 hour maximum 30 mg/dose ) . Systematic review literature call clinical trial evaluate effect different dos corticosteroid treat pediatric asthma patient hospitalized exacerbation . This study use randomize , double-blind , control trial design order compare efficacy two different steroid dos resolve acute exacerbation asthma hospitalized child . Children hospitalize asthma exacerbation CHOP emergency department ( ED ) eligible study enrollment . Those meet enrollment criterion randomize receive prednisolone either high dose ( 1.0 mg/kg ( max 30 mg ) every 6 hour ) , low dose ( 1.0 mg/kg ( max 30 mg ) every 12 hour placebo dose 6 hour interval ) first 48 hour hospitalization . Once 48 hour past , patient still hospitalize receive 1.0 mg/kg ( max 30 mg ) every 12 hour duration hospitalization . Approximately 156 patient 78 arm study enrol . This study complete six eight month . A non-inferiority study design use . The primary outcome duration hospitalization , determine duration time elapse first dose prednisolone administer emergency department ( ED ) discharge dose albuterol administer . Secondary outcome include time elapsed time admission order write discharge order write , time spent severity level asthma care pathway , degree rate improvement force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , improvement peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) , improvement asthma symptom score , rate relapse discharge .</detailed_description>
