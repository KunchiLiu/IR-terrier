The total duration patient participation study approximately 2 week . The primary assessment effectiveness include clinical response treatment ( categorize post-therapy cured , improve , fail ) microbiological response post-therapy ( elimination disease-causing bacteria , categorize eradicate , partially eradication , persist , determine patient type bacteria ) . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , physical examination , laboratory test ) perform throughout study . The study hypothesis treatment levofloxacin least effective well tolerate treatment ciprofloxacin patient uncomplicated infection skin supportive layer beneath skin .
