	<brief_summary>To demonstrate safety efficacy intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) treatment previously irradiate recurrent head neck cancer . Specific Aims : Identify acute late toxicity , response rate , locoregional control , disease free survival , overall survival IMRT . Also , tumor response , amount tumor shrinkage reduction , analyze . Rationale : Recurrent head neck cancer regard limited treatment modality since salvage surgery accomplish limited subgroup patient . Chemotherapy show clear clinical benefit significant toxicity . Re-irradiation use treatment modality . However , re-irradiation dose limit significant toxicity occur cumulative dose radiation . The use IMRT give high dose recurrent tumor limit dose critical structure vicinity reirradiated volume thereby limit toxicity treat recurrence adequate dose . The number subject determine 2 stage design historical control group comparison , number subject find 40 . It assume treatment regimen interest true response rate le 32.6 % ( Po0.326 ) . It also assume true response rate 53 % ( P10.53 ) would considerable interest treatment recurrent head neck cancer . The type I error ( probability reject hypothesis proportion respond treatment less equal Po hypothesis actually true ) 0.05 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must pathologically confirm recurrence ( reappearance previously clear ) squamous cell cancer primary locate upper aerodigestive tract second squamous cell primary . Patients may experience one recurrence long first recurrence occur great 6 month follow end prior RT . Pathology slide primary well recurrence must obtain review UCI Department Pathology confirm histology patient eligibility . Previous radiation record include simulation portal film must submit UCI Department Radiation Oncology review treat area assure spinal cord tolerance exceed . 2 . The recurrence second primary must define bidimensional measurement follow : All tumor measurement must record centimeter consist two long perpendicular crossdiameters . Patients separately assess response physical exam CT scan contrast ( unless contraindicate ) MRI scan T1 contrast gadolinium ( unless contraindicate ) T2 sequence prior two month follow completion therapy . Both clinical ( physical exam ) radiographic ( CT MRI ) response record study form . 3 . Recurrence second primary must confine head neck clavicle . 4 . The patient must candidate refuse complete surgical ( ) resection . 5 . The majority ( &gt; 75 % ) tumor volume must area previously irradiate &gt; 45 Gy . The previous irradiation must exceed maximum 75 Gy . 6 . Primary recurrent cancer treatment cumulative radiation dose must limit total spinal cord dose 50 Gy . 7 . Patients must least 1 month prior chemotherapy radiation therapy . 8 . Karnofsky status 60 great . ( appendix ) 9 . WBC &gt; 4000/mm3 , granulocyte &gt; 2,000/mm3 , platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 , serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl , creatinine &lt; 1.8 mg/dl within one month enrollment protocol . 10 . If liver chemistry normal limit , liver ultrasound CT require . 11 . Patient must history invasive malignancy within past five year , exclude nonmelanomatous skin cancer cervical cancer insitu . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Distant metastasis . 2 . History invasive malignancy within past five year exclude nonmelanomatous skin cancer cervical cancer insitu . 3 . Medical condition , would impede patient tolerance therapy , completion therapy limit survival . 4 . Women pregnant exclude trial . A pregnancy test offer woman child bear age otherwise eligible protocol . 5 . Patients 18 year age exclude since head neck cancer unlikely due risk long term toxicity radiation include secondary malignancy 6 . Patients treatment currently recurrent head neck cancer 7 . Patients untreated infection 8 . Patients candidate complete surgical resection . 9 . Patients previous irradiation exceed maximum 75 Gy</criteria>
