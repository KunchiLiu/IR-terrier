	<detailed_description>DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Medication Adherence Blood Pressure Control Trial ( ABC Trial ) randomize control trial multicultural population uncontrolled , hypertensive patient test effectiveness stepped-care intervention involve 2 stage : ( 1 ) Self-Telemonitoring ( STM ) blood pressure ( BP ) use telephone transmission system easy-to-use modem , contain BP monitor , send BP measurement commercial service ( Lifelink Monitoring ) send measurements patient 's health care provider ; ( 2 ) Telephone-Based Nurse Case Management ( NCM ) , provide commercially available service ( U-Med ) . The nurse case manager call patient once/month , provide counsel regard BP control , adherence medication regimen . All patient intervention condition begin STM ; 3 month , patient whose BP come control remain STM condition ; patient whose BP remain uncontrolled randomize , half NCM + Self-Telemonitoring ; half continue STM ( design allow u evaluate effect arm intervention separately , combination ; addition , Usual Care condition ) . The focus intervention strategy readily transfer variety usual health care situation . Both intervention commercially available , therefore accessible wide range health care provider , include small community-based clinic . An innovative aspect intervention 2 commercial service work together ; nurse case manager receive BP report Lifelink , nurse use basis counseling . The effectiveness intervention test 12 community-based clinic , serve economically disadvantage , largely African American Hispanic population , New York City . The main outcome measure medication adherence , determine electronic drug event monitoring ( MEMS ) , pharmacy refill record , well BP control . Study duration 1 year . The multilevel focus intervention provider well patient behavior . Reviews conduct patient study discharge , record data clinic BP measurement previous 12 month , , doctor appointment , ER visit , medication change , evidence physician respond intervention . The long-term goal research assess medical cost effectiveness intervention separately , combine .</detailed_description>
