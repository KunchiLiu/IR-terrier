	<brief_summary>The purpose study help improve understand biology involve body 's response serious trauma burn injury . The host response trauma burn collection physiological pathophysiological process depend critically upon regulation human innate immune system , particular emphasis inflammatory component system . No single research center small group center capacity delineate integrate response complex biological system , involve multiple molecular genetic interaction vary time . Our proposal promote identification important dynamic relationship regulate integration complex biological system , expectation understand ultimately impact diagnosis , prognosis , treatment hospitalize , severely injured patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This large-scale collaborative project provide mean acquire necessary new knowledge directly human . Knowledge acquire use diverse state-of-the-art genomic proteomic technology , highly complex clinical , proteomic , genomic database , well newly-developed , novel analytical tool probe complex dataset . Our analytical capability genomic proteomic level rapidly evolve ability link genomic proteomic data pathway functional module help u closely link cellular data immunological process ultimately , phenotypic response ( i.e. , trajectory ) injure host . As result , potential intervention , whether Program funding mechanism , effectively design .</detailed_description>
