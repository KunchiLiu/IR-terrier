	<brief_summary>Chronic myeloid leukemia serious disease characterize progression relatively quiescent stage disease aggressive phase . Although highly successful medical therapy know Gleevec ( Imatinib ) , treatment always successful patient develop resistance . Those patient limit treatment option . We develop gene therapy model treatment disease use pseudoviral particle insert molecule genetic material would allow harmful gene cause leukemia function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use SV40 Vectors Treat Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A novel methodology facilitates specific silence gene recently develop . The method base property small molecule nucleic acid ( RNA ) specifically repress expression target gene . These small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) molecules recently demonstrate repress , tissue culture cell , one two type common fusion gene present CML patient . Those study show treatment synthetic siRNA inhibit cell growth increase sensitivity imatinib . These finding offer hope novel form gene therapy base strategy may improve treatment outcome CML patient , particularly use combination approach tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mention . Our group develop innovative vector suitable deliver siRNA molecule human hematopoietic cell sufficient efficacy . The vector base monkey virus call simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) . The viral coat , capsid , produce biosynthetically . It engineer self-assemble test tube around nucleic acid choice , deliver DNA RNA target cell . This vector safer available viral vector since viral genetic material exclude final product . The vector elicit immune response , thus allow repeat administration.We start project test recently publish siRNA molecules one fusion gene , several alternative siRNA molecule design fusion gene . The molecule test efficacy tissue culture cell-lines , measure repression respective fusion gene , reduction level tyrosine kinase inhibition cell growth . The effective siRNA molecule select study . The vector test cell-lines gene silence cell death . At final stage test best vector efficacy white blood cell obtain CML patient .</detailed_description>
