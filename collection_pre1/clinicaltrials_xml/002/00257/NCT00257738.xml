	<detailed_description>Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck affect 43,000 individual United States annually estimate overall survival rate 50 % . In order improve survival rate quality life patient develop unresectable disease recurrence , new therapeutic alternative mandate . One potential treatment alternative patient population use peptide-based immunotherapy . Despite success fo preclinical study use peptide vaccine , therapeutic response patient sporadic . The reason failure multifactorial include problem patient selection , limited number antigenic target , inability correlate immunologic response therapeutic efficacy . Specifically , patient disseminate SCCHN defect antigen processing , presentation effector mechanisms limit ability respond T cell base immunotherapy . Additionally , paucity antigenic peptide epitope define SCCHN , immunologic monitoring correlate well clinical response . Recently several investigator , include research team , identify high prevalence MAGE-A3 HPV 16 SCCHN , characterize several putative cytolytic helper epitope . Additionally , define novel method enhance immune response therapeutic peptide vaccine use Trojan complex compose CD4 CD8 T-cell epitope , connect furin cleavable linkers . In order define feasibility safety agent combination GM-CSF montanide ISA 51 immunotherapy SCCHN , propose trial , screen patient immunologic competence base specific eligibility criterion include antigen HLA-A2 expression tumor . In registered patient , test ability two novel Trojan peptide complex , compose MAGE-A3 human papilloma virus 16 ( HPV 16 ) epitope , stimulate antigen-specific CD 4 CD 8 T-cell response . Finally , correlate immunologic response cell dose generation HPV 16 MAGE-A3 antigen loss HLA-A2 loss variant tumor evaluate patient : 1 ) Changes tumor size physical measurement CT plus PET measurement ; 2 ) Determining proportion individual achieve complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) ; 3 ) Progression-free survival ; 4 ) Survival . Successful completion clinical trial result development strong foundation Phase II/III clinical trial use HPV 16 MAGE-A3 Trojan peptides immunotherapy SCCHN .</detailed_description>
