	<brief_summary>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) form inflammatory bowel disease affect part digestive system . Symptoms chronic illness include abdominal pain , bloating , nausea , vomit , diarrhea . CD also cause bowel wall ulcer , stricture ( narrowing hollow structure due scar tissue swell ) , fistula ( abnormal passage intestines another organ skin ) . CD think arise combination inherit ( genetic ) factor undefined environmental factor ( ) . One environmental factor show intimately involved development CD presence bacteria normally inhabit intestine . As result , physician try alter normal bacterial population mean control inflammation ( swell ) intestine individual CD . Among strategy use combination metronidazole ciprofloxacin . These broad-spectrum antibiotic control CD symptom act intestinal bacteria contribute chronic inflammation . More investigation need firmly establish usefulness therapy previous clinical trial give mixed result , although suggested antibiotic particularly useful case Crohn 's colitis ( CD primarily affect large intestine ) . Because early study lack large enough patient population colonic involvement , trial focus CD subgroup sufficient number subject help clarify value combine metronidazole ciprofloxacin . The propose study test hypothesis combination antibiotic therapy effective treatment CD involve colon . The study compare use combination therapy consist metronidazole ciprofloxacin placebo ( dummy tablet ) examine result treatment end 8 week treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Antibiotics Treatment Colonic Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role bacteria microbial agent pathogenesis Crohn 's disease suggest support animal model inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) presence normal gut flora require initiation full expression inflammatory reaction . In human Crohn 's disease , antibiotic commonly use even though evidence support practice strong . Several study indicate antibiotic biological activity Crohn 's disease activity may pronounce subset patient colonic involvement . In order well justify use antibiotic treatment Crohn 's disease , Antibiotics Colonic Crohn 's Disease trial design determine ciprofloxacin metronidazole combination therapy effective treatment active Crohn 's disease colon . This two arm , multi-centre , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled study involve 136 patient mild moderate active Crohn 's disease colon ( without ileal involvement ) , define Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) score 220 450 . Eligible patient randomly assign receive one two treatment regimen : ( 1 ) ciprofloxacin ( 500 mg po bid ; provide 1 x 500 mg tablet ) metronidazole ( &lt; 50 kg , 250 mg po bid ; 50-75 kg , 250 mg po tid ; &gt; 75 kg , 500 mg po bid ; dos provide 1 x 250 mg tablet ) ( 2 ) placebo . Treatment continue period 8 week . Treatment success define complete response therapy end eight week . Complete response ( remission ) define reduction CDAI score 150 point reduction least 70 point baseline . Partial response ( improvement ) analyze secondary outcome measure define reduction CDAI score 70 point final value 150 point great . Patients experience persistent rise CDAI score 100 point two consecutive visit rise CDAI score 400 point visit consider treatment failure withdraw study . The primary analysis intent-to-treat comparison proportion patient achieve remission 8 week ciprofloxacin/metronidazole placebo group . Secondary outcome measure evaluate partial response adverse event rate .</detailed_description>
