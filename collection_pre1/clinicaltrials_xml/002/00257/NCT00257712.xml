	<detailed_description>There considerable compelling evidence animal human literature action somatotrophic hormonal axis ( growth hormone release hormone/growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I ) significant predictable effect cognitive function ( memory reason ability ) . A preliminary study recently show five month growth hormone release hormone ( GHRH ) treatment improve cognitive function healthy old men woman ; also preliminary evidence support likelihood similar effect individual diagnose MCI . The study sample include 160 adult , age 55-90 , half cognitively healthy normal adult half meet diagnostic criterion Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . Each group contain equal number men woman . The treatment GHRH twenty week duration . In light documented interaction estrogens GHRH/GH/IGF-I , two study arm contain equal proportion woman estrogen replacement therapy ( NERT ) woman oral estrogen replacement therapy ( ERT ) . ERT woman maintain regular steady dosage estrogen least seven day precede assessment Cognitive assessment evaluate treatment-related change memory thinking ability , well blood collection evaluate several biomarkers interest , perform baseline , 10 20 week treatment , ten week post-treatment . In addition five medication symptom monitor visit treatment period . The study hypotheses : H1 : Healthy , cognitively normal old men woman treat GHRH show beneficial effect cognitive function , include measure memory , relative placebo treat subject . H2 : MCI patient treat GHRH show beneficial effect cognitive function , include measure memory , relative placebo treat MCI patient . H3 : Changes insulin-like-growth factor ( IGF-I ) predict change cognition normal old adult MCI patient treat GHRH .</detailed_description>
