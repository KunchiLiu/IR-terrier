	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Levofloxacin Compared With Cefaclor Treatment Adults With Chronic Bronchitis Experiencing Rapid Onset Worsening Symptoms Caused Bacteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , parallel group , multicenter study determine effectiveness safety 488 mg levofloxacin ( daily mouth 5 - 7 day ) compare 250 mg cefaclor ( every 8 hour 7 - 10 day ) adults chronic bronchitis experience rapid onset worsening symptom cause bacterial infection . The study consist 3 visit : one visit screen enrollment , 2 visit assessment safety effectiveness ( one visit Days 3 - 5 study one visit [ post-therapy ] 5 - 7 day last dose study drug ) . The total duration patient participation study approximately 2 week . Levofloxacin cefaclor antibacterial agent use treatment many type infection , include infection rapid onset brief duration cause bacteria . The primary assessment effectiveness study microbiologic response treatment ( rate elimination disease-causing bacteria , patient , type bacteria ) , 5 - 7 day last dose study drug . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , physical examination , laboratory test ) perform throughout study . The study hypothesis treatment levofloxacin least effective well tolerate treatment cefaclor adult patient chronic bronchitis experience sudden worsening symptom cause bacterial infection . Levofloxacin 488 mg mouth daily 5 - 7 day , cefaclor 250 mg mouth every 8 hour 7 - 10 day .</detailed_description>
