	<brief_title>Immune System Function Following Vaccination HIV Infected Children Taking Anti-HIV Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With immunocompromised status , HIV-infected child especially high risk opportunistic infection , include infection Streptococcus pneumoniae , hepatitis B , measles . In PACTG P1024 , HIV-infected child take highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) receive 2 dos pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) , 1 dose pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV ) , booster shot hepatitis B vaccine ( HBV ) measles , mumps , rubella vaccine ( MMR ) . Early response vaccination favorable , decline antibody response within 18 month vaccination . It unknown additional booster vaccination child result protective immunologic memory upon re-exposure pathogen . This study determine whether HIV-infected child HAART evidence specific immunologic memory 3 4 year vaccination PACTG P1024 . Patients randomly assign receive PCV PPV study entry . All eligible patient also receive HBV MMR study entry . Patients monitor clinic 1 hour vaccination adverse effect . Study staff contact patient phone around Day 3 study entry ask patient experience adverse effect vaccination ; patient receive MMR study entry contact around Day 21 . Some patient may ask return clinic evaluation experience side effect . There study visit study entry Days 7 28 . Medical history , physical exam , blood collection , assessment HIV-related symptom occur visit . HAART provide study .</detailed_description>
