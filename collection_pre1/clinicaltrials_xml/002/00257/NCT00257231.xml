	<brief_summary>The purpose study help improve understand biology involve body 's response serious trauma burn injury . The host response trauma burn collection physiological pathophysiological process depend critically upon regulation human innate immune system , particular emphasis inflammatory component system . No single research center small group center capacity delineate integrate response complex biological system , involve multiple molecular genetic interaction vary time . Our proposal promote identification important dynamic relationship regulate integration complex biological system , expectation understand ultimately impact diagnosis , prognosis , treatment hospitalize , severely injured patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This large-scale collaborative project provide mean acquire necessary new knowledge directly human . Knowledge acquire use diverse state-of-the-art genomic proteomic technology , highly complex clinical , proteomic , genomic database , well newly-developed , novel analytical tool probe complex dataset . Our analytical capability genomic proteomic level rapidly evolve ability link genomic proteomic data pathway functional module help u closely link cellular data immunological process ultimately , phenotypic response ( i.e. , trajectory ) injure host . As result , potential intervention , whether Program funding mechanism , effectively design .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion enrollment trauma study follow : Blunt trauma without isolated head injury Absence traumatic brain injury , define either AIS head &lt; 4 OR GCS motor &gt; 3 within 24 hour injury Emergency Department arrival &lt; =6 hour time injury Blood transfusion within 12 hour injury Base deficit &gt; =6 OR systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg within 60 minute emergency department arrival Fully partially intact cervical spinal cord All patient meet criterion enter epidemiologic database assess specific exclusion criterion establish whether serial blood draw warrant . The presence follow exclusion criterion disqualifies subject trauma sample study . Age &lt; 16 Anticipated survival &lt; 24 hour injury Anticipated survival &lt; 28 day due preexist medical condition Inability obtain first blood draw within first 12 hour injury Traumatic brain injury ; i.e. , GCS â‰¤8 ICU admission AND brain computerize tomography scan abnormality within 12 hour injury Inability obtain informed consent Preexisting , ongoing immunosuppression e.g . transplant recipient Preexisting , ongoing immunosuppression e.g . chronic high dose corticosteroid ( &gt; 20 mg/prednisoneequivalents/day ) Preexisting , ongoing immunosuppression e.g . oncolytic drug ( ) therapy within past 14 day Preexisting , ongoing immunosuppression e.g . HIV positive AND CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 Possible requirement early immunosuppression e.g . significant likelihood require high dose corticosteroid ( e.g . spinal injury ) Significant preexist organ dysfunction lung : currently receive home oxygen therapy , document medical record Significant preexist organ dysfunction heart : congestive heart failure , document medical record Significant preexist organ dysfunction renal : chronic renal failure ( creatinine &gt; 2 ) Significant preexist organ dysfunction liver : cirrhosis portal hypertension encephalopathy Patient injure sample enrollment temporarily hold</criteria>
