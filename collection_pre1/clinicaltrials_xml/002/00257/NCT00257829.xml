	<brief_summary>The Phenomenon Tumor Hypoxia Many solid tumor relatively resistant treatment ionize radiation certain chemotherapeutic agent anthracyclines affect adversely acidic pH . These effect primarily attribute presence hypoxic cell within tumor . The relevance hypoxia respect failure radiotherapy cure certain malignancy chequer history . However , recent year evidence hypoxia play central role relative radioresistance become compelling . Since approximately two-thirds woman suffer cervical carcinoma receive radiation component therapy , enhance understanding interaction hypoxia radiation component therapy , enhance understanding interaction hypoxia radiation resistance critical improve outcome among cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
