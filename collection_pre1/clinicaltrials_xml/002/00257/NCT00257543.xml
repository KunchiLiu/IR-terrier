	<brief_summary>We hope gain valuable information safety , success engraftment , rate complication use alternate donor transplantation child severe SCD . Crucial information also collect late effect alternate donor BMT sickle cell , provide valuable information clinician family make decision among intervention child severe sickle cell disease . If successful , alternate donor transplantation setting could pave way offer curative treatment many patient severe SCD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SALT : Alternative Donor Bone Marrow Cord Blood Transplantation High Risk Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unfortunately , less 1/4th patient severe SCD match sibling donor serve BMT donor . This research protocol propose study safety usefulness `` alternate donor transplant '' ( use donor match sibling ) . We offer treatment child severe sickle cell disease match sibling BMT donor . Alternative donor family member slightly less completely match , unrelated volunteer donor completely match , donate banked umbilical cord blood completely nearly completely match . Alternative donor transplant perform commonly patient cancer , also provide curative therapy several non-malignant disease ( severe immunodeficiency , marrow failure metabolic storage disease ) . Alternate donor transplant carry high risk complication , include graft-versus-host disease , infection , graft failure . Therefore , selective patient invited participate , limit eligibility patient severe SCD relate problem ( rather well likely SCD relate problem ) , exclude patient severe organ damage likely die transplant , limit eligibility young age group . A multi-step review algorithm include internal , local external expert review construct provide thorough , safe ethical accrual process . We treat patient use drug method commonly use alternate donor transplant diseases leukemia , incorporate lesson learn previous experience BMT sickle cell modify supportive care measure . Special attention give evaluation post-BMT effect population , well potential reason adverse effect ( graft failure ) . We think Atlanta particularly good place study kind transplant several reason . One reason experience : program transplant child SCD single institution North America , excellent outcome . Additionally , SCD patient area often treat special red cell transfusion program limit number people donate blood ; think likely reduce chance graft failure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hemoglobin SS , hemoglobin SC , hemoglobin S0 thalassemia Donor available : Partially ( 5/6 ) HLAmatched relative ( PMRD ) , match ( 6/6 ) unrelated marrow donor umbilical cord ( 5/6 6/6 ) appropriate size ( see 6.3.2 ) , use highresolution HLA typing . Donor must homozygous HgbS must meet standard donor eligibility criterion Blood Marrow Transplant Program . Severe SCD , define one following ( modified Walters criterion ) : oPrevious ( 6 month prior ) central nervous system event last long 24 hour , plus objective imaging evidence CNS vasculopathy , without residual neurologic finding oFrequent ( 3 per year 2 year ) painful vasoocclusive episode ( defined episode last 4 hour require hospitalization outpatient treatment parenteral narcotic ) oRecurrent ( 3 lifetime ) acute chest syndrome event necessitated exchange transfusion chronic transfusion therapy . Must fail goodfaith trial hydroxyurea ( failure define reduction less 50 % incidence vasoocclusive event period least 18 month ) demonstrate inability take drug due side effect . oAny combination 3 acute chest syndrome episode vasoocclusive pain episode ( define ) yearly 3 year . Must fail goodfaith trial hydroxyurea ( failure define reduction less 50 % incidence vasoocclusive event period least 18 month ) demonstrate inability take drug due side effect . oStage I II sickle lung disease oRedcell alloimmunization ( 2 antibody ) chronic transfusion therapy oSuitable HLAidentical relative donor available oBiopsy proven chronic active hepatitis , portal fibrosis , cirrhosis , serologic evidence active hepatitis . oSCD chronic lung disease stage III ( see Appendix ) oSevere renal dysfunction define &lt; 50 % predict normal GFR age . oSevere cardiac dysfunction define shorten fraction &lt; 25 % . oSevere residual neurologic impairment hemiplegia alone , define fullscale IQ 70 , quadriplegia paraplegia , inability ambulate , inability communicate without assistive device , impairment result decline Lansky performance score &lt; 70 % . oCNS event occur within 6 month prior transplant oKarnofsky Lansky functional performance score &lt; 70 % ( see Appendix ) oConfirmed HIV seropositivity . oPatient unspecified chronic toxicity serious enough detrimentally affect patient 's capacity tolerate bone marrow transplantation . oPatient patient 's guardian ( ) unable understand nature risk inherent BMT process . oHistory lack compliance medical care would jeopardize transplant course .</criteria>
