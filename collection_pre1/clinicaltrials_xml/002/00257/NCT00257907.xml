	<brief_summary>This study examine immune system respond infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria ( bacteria cause tuberculosis ) order well understand germ produce infection immune response might work control infection . Only one 10 people infect M. tuberculosis become sick , sometimes year even decades exposure . It known people become sick , immune system people never develop disease may well able control bacteria . This study evaluate latent form M. tuberculosis infection understand immune mechanism - particularly role certain white blood cell - involved disease process . Healthy volunteer 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , family history medical condition , sexual history , history drug use , physical examination blood test , include test HIV . People Mali , West Africa , local health clinic United States may participate . At start study , participant blood test tuberculin skin test ( PPD test ) , indicate whether person expose tuberculosis bacteria . For PPD , tiny amount liquid contain dead tuberculosis antigen put skin forearm needle . The antigen cause infection disease . After 3 day , participant another blood test site tuberculin test examine swell would indicate positive result . Participants positive PPD chest x-ray check tuberculosis disease . Those whose x-ray also positive withdrawn study refer doctor evaluation treatment . Those whose x-ray negative return clinic within 3 week tuberculin test give another blood sample . Participants whose PPD negative second tuberculin test 10 21 day later return 3 day test determine still negative positive . ( Some people negative first test may test positive second procedure . ) Those whose test still negative end participation study time . Participants whose second PPD positive chest x-ray described , negative chest x-ray return 3 week donate one last blood sample . The purpose present study evaluate latent form infection , prevalence worldwide exceed active disease . Our hypothesis latent tuberculosis antigen specific effector memory CD4+ T cell responsible generation clinically measurable delay type hypersensitivity central memory CD4+T cell directly involved process . We base idea assumption latent tuberculosis state antigen persistence effector memory T cell maintain long antigen/infection present . We propose conduct study Mali , West Africa local clinic U.S . Tuberculosis affect 593/100,000 ( 2 ) individual Mali expose disease . Additionally would important evaluate parameter locally latent infection one major factor reactivation tuberculosis country . Patients would enrol 4 major group : HIV-/TST- ( Group A ) , HIV-/TST+ ( Group B ) , HIV+/TST+ ( G roup C ) HIV+/TST- ( Group D ) . To evaluate hypothesis plan enroll 100 - 300 patient course 2 year country . Blood sample predetermine time point application Purified Protein Derivative ( PPD ) obtain determine fraction CD4+ T cell produce interferon gamma response stimulation PPD 16hr antigen stimulation assay . Appropriate stain do ascertain phenotype well cytokine production ( Interferon gamma , ( IFN gamma ) , Interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) Tumour Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) ) . Additionally lymphocyte proliferation study use 5- ( and-6 ) -carboxyflouorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester ( CFSE . ) In conduct study hope understand immune mechanism involve , particularly mechanisms T cell memory , would provide insight TB HIV pathogenesis . We also believe understand mechanism could lead towards establishment surrogate immunity TB vaccine study , could enhance vaccine trial design . It might also help understand well immunological dynamic tuberculosis co-infection individual HIV infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) major global health concern . One third world 's population infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Two 3 million people die every year disease 8-10 million new case per year . It project 90 million new case 30 million death next decade . For disease , know exist since 2400 BC , understand pathogenesis incomplete , especially relation human immune response role lymphocytes particular . The purpose present study evaluate latent form infection , prevalence worldwide exceed active disease . Our hypothesis latent tuberculosis antigen specific effector memory CD4+ T cell responsible generation clinically measurable delay type hypersensitivity central memory CD4+T cell directly involved process . We base idea assumption latent tuberculosis state antigen persistence effector memory T cell maintain long antigen/infection present . We propose conduct study Mali , West Africa local clinic U.S .
