	<detailed_description>This five-year application concern prevent substance abuse , comorbid mental behavioral disorder , school failure . We direct integrate set previously test preventive first-grade intervention two correlate confirm early antecedent : early aggressive , disruptive behavior poor achievement . The intervention propose integrate test direct improving : 1 ) teacher 's classroom behavior management ; 2 ) family/classroom partnership regard homework discipline ; 3 ) teacher 's instructional practice regard academic subject , particularly reading . The combined preventive educational intervention strategy single Whole Day ( WD ) first-grade classroom program , build empirically determine recognition interdependence risk factor across substance abuse educational failure . As past Baltimore preventive trial , propose test effectiveness WD developmental epidemiological design child teacher randomly assign intervention standard set condition ( control ; SC ) . A special aspect proposal design propose lay foundation move learn policy practice . While follow first-grade child far end third grade , follow first grade teacher two subsequent cohort first grader , test whether support training structure sustain high level WD practice . We also test whether support training structure successful train non-WD teacher , far trial result warrant . This prevention service aim augment economic analysis cost effectiveness WD program . The research effectiveness combine research move effectiveness practice increase efficiency develop evidence-based program faster early prevention education field . This grant would set foundation grant follow cohort study child teacher periodically assess preventive impact intervention later substance abuse extend teacher ' use WD practice . This prevention research Baltimore continue aegis Community Institutional Board ( see letter support ) . This proposal involve close institutional collaboration among American Institutes Research ( AIR ) ; Baltimore City Public School System ( BCPSS ) ; Morgan State University ( MSU ) ; Oregon Social Learning Center ( OSLC ) ; Prevention Science Methodology Group ( PSMG ) ; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health ; Center Academic Reading Skills University Texas-Houston . The aim propose work 1 . Implement evaluate effectiveness whole-day preventive intervention program first grade ( WD ) direct reduce antecedent risk factor later substance abuse , comorbid mental behavioral disorder , school failure . 2 . Measure variation impact WD owe variation experimentally manipulate quality teacher ' specific WD practice around classroom behavior management , family/classroom partnership , quality instruction , particularly regard read . These analysis include source variation well , child social context family , classroom school , peer , community . 3 . Test effectiveness support training structure require develop maintain high-quality implementation WD ) effectiveness trial ; b ) result warrant , sustain high-quality WD consecutive cohort first grader ; c ) extend hypothesize high quality WD WD teacher . 4 . Carry economic analysis cost implement WD cost-effectiveness compare SC respect reduction risk factor illicit substance abuse , well tobacco , HIV , school failure , comorbid mental behavioral disorder . B . Background Significance Over past three decade , evidence developmental epidemiological study consistently identify specific antecedent risk factor least early first grade predictive later substance abuse comorbid mental behavioral disorder middle school year beyond ( Cairns , Cairns , &amp; Neckerman , 1995 ; Farrington , 1995 ; Hawkins , Catalano , &amp; Miller , 1992 ; Hawkins , Doueck , &amp; Lishner , 1988 ; Kellam , Brown , Rubin , &amp; Ensminger , 1983 ; Reid , 1993 ; Reid &amp; Eddy , 1997 ) . Many antecedent exhibited school setting , aggressive , disruptive behavior first grade strong correlate , poor academic achievement . These early risk factor lead later substance abuse school dropout , considerable economic , social , psychological consequence ( Dishion , Capaldi , &amp; Yoerger , 1999 ; Eddy , Reid , &amp; Fetrow , 2000 ; Hawkins et al. , 1992 ; Kellam et al. , 1983 ; Kellam , Mayer , Rebok , &amp; Hawkins , 1998 ; Maguin &amp; Loeber , 1996 ; Mrazek &amp; Haggerty , 1994 ; Reid , Eddy , Fetrow , &amp; Stoolmiller , 1999 [ see Appendix-1 paper ] ) . These risk factor also strongly relate host risk factor separately together predictive adolescence young adulthood drug abuse , also conduct disorder violence , depression , school drop , high-risk sexual behavior . Ineffective parent around discipline homework ; classroom high level aggressive , disruptive behavior ; antisocial classmates peer ; poverty family level school community level , individual difference sensation seek ( Wills , Sandy , &amp; Yaeger , 2000 ; Palmgreen , Donohew , Lorch , Hoyle , &amp; Stephenson , 2001 ) —all find increase risk drug abuse relate comorbid problem ( Ary et al. , 1999 ; Dishion et al. , 1999 ; Kellam , Ling , Meriska , Brown , &amp; Ialongo , 1998 [ see Appendix-2 paper ] ; Reid , Patterson , &amp; Snyder , press ) . In Baltimore , Oregon , elsewhere , rigorous , developmental , epidemiologically base , randomized field trial direct intervention decrease early risk factor classroom , family , peer-group setting . These trial indicate school-based universal intervention ( i.e. , address child , merely high risk ) short-term beneficial effect aggressive behavior achievement ( Dolan et al. , 1993 ; Ialongo et al. , 1999 ; Reid , et al. , 1999 ) , off-task behavior ( Brown , 1994a , 1993b ) , depressive symptom ( Kellam , Rebok , Mayer , Ialongo , &amp; Kalodner , 1994 ) . Impact first grade intervention reduce aggression middle school report ( Kellam , Rebok , Ialongo , &amp; Mayer [ see Appendix-3 paper ] , 1994 ; Kellam , Ling et al. , 1998 ) , delinquency ( Eddy et al. , 2000 ) . Longer-term effect illicit drug use observe Baltimore work ( see Figure 1 ) . Reductions initiation tobacco use show result Baltimore first grade preventive intervention three separate cohort ( Kellam &amp; Anthony , 1998 [ see Appendix-4 paper ] ; Storr , Ialongo , Kellam , &amp; Anthony , press ) . Longer-term impact report meta-analyses illicit drug use Nan Tobler colleague ( 1986 ; 2000 ; Tobler et al. , 2000 ) plus meta-analyses ( Derzon &amp; Lipsey , 1999 ; Gorman , 1995 ) . Higher-fidelity implementation intervention also lead high impact ( Ialongo et al. , 1999 [ see Appendix-5 paper ] , Ialongo , Poduska , Werthamer , &amp; Kellam , 2001 [ see Appendix-6 paper ] ) . Further , find compelling evidence universal intervention often great impact high risk substance abuse aggression ( Brown &amp; Liao , 1999 [ see Appendix-7 paper ] ; Curran &amp; Muthèn , 1999 ; Muthèn &amp; Curran , 1997 ; Muthèn et al. , submit ; Stoolmiller , Eddy , &amp; Reid , 2000 [ see Appendix-8 paper ] ) .</detailed_description>
