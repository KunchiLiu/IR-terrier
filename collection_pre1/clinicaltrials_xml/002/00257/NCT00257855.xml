	<brief_summary>A present safe treatment reduce rate disability worsen people secondary progressive multiple sclerosis . Recent research suggest possibility drug act block entry sodium nerve cell protect nerve fibre brain spinal cord . In trial , investigator test whether one drug , call lamotrigine , prevent damage nerve fibre reduce rate MS worsen . The period treatment trial run 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised Controlled Trial Neuroprotection With Lamotrigine Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present , safe , widely applicable treatment capable reduce rate disability advance secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ) . There good evidence primary cause disability axonal degeneration within CNS , considerable interest develop treatment protect axon degeneration . Experimental work member group establish axon may degenerate upon exposure inflammatory mediator nitric oxide . The mechanism damage implies protection might afford novel approach partially block sodium channel , group others recently demonstrate drug include flecainide , phenytoin lamotrigine reduce axonal degeneration optic nerve spinal root expose nitric oxide , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis . Aims : To assess whether sodium channel blocker lamotrigine neuroprotective , disease modify effect ) rate axonal degeneration b ) accumulation disability patient SPMS . Methodology : We propose recruit 120 people SPMS progression rather relapse major cause increase disability double blind parallel group control trial last two year random allocation would make receive treatment either lamotrigine placebo . We anticipate patient recruitment , follow-up trial management could achieve readily across four propose site London . The primary endpoint would effect treatment cerebral atrophy , correlate MR marker axonal loss , measure reliably sensitively use recently develop MR technique . The trial power detect 60 % beneficial effect rate development cerebral atrophy . Secondary endpoint would include effect treatment spinal cord atrophy clinical measurement impairment/disability . MR measure brain volume cervical spinal cord cross-sectional area score clinical impairment/disability would determine entry , 12 24 month . Brain volume would measure additionally 6 18 month . Clinical follow-up would occur every 3 month , interim analysis plan 12 month . Utilization result : A phase 2 trial sodium channel blockade SPMS timely , give recent advance arise experimental imaging work . A successful outcome would enable sufficiently power phase 3 trial implement , perhaps significantly would demonstrate novel , safe neuroprotective strategy reduce long-term disability disorder .</detailed_description>
