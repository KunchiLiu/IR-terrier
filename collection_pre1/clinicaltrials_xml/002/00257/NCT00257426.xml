	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Octreotide may stop slow growth tumor cell may effective treatment liver cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well octreotide work treat patient locally advance metastatic liver cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Octreotide Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To verify long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide ( Sandostatin LAR ) depot extend median survival 5 month 8.75 month patient locally advance metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma CLIP score 3 . Secondary - To document tolerability drug patient population . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord underlie degree liver disease define CLIP score classification . Patients receive short-acting octreotide subcutaneously three time daily day 1-21 OR day 1-28 . If patient tolerates short-acting octreotide , first dose long-acting octreotide ( Sandostatin LAR ) depot give intramuscularly begin day 8 OR day 15 . Treatment long-acting octreotide repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 6 month .</detailed_description>
