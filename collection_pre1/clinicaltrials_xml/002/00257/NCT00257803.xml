	<detailed_description>Oxytocin normally give either rapidly vein ( bolus ) put intravenous bag administer slowly , delivery baby cesarean section . Both method commonly use . To date little research demonstrate one method give oxytocin well another woman likely bleed delivery . The purpose study see whether small bolus oxytocin make uterus contract well reduce bleed decrease need give additional oxytocin powerful drug woman risk bleed delivery baby cesarean section . Women participate randomize ( like toss coin ) one two group . Neither woman anesthesiologist obstetrician know group . In one group , woman receive small injection saline ( salt water ) directly vein via intravenous ( bolus ) baby bear . In group , woman receive small injection oxytocin directly vein via intravenous ( bolus ) baby bear . Both group standard amount oxytocin give slowly ( 30 minute period ) intravenous arm ( infusion ) . The amount oxytocin put intravenous bag normal amount would give cesarean section woman involve study start initial injection give . The difference two group one group extra dose oxytocin give directly vein via intravenous saline solution give directly vein via intravenous . Information obtain study include decrease blood pressure increase heart rate time saline oxytocin give directly vein . The obstetrician ask indicate well uterus contract ask anesthesiologist give oxytocin powerful drug , opinion , uterus contract well . This normal way do . If woman feel dizzy ( possibly secondary low blood pressure ) anesthesiologist treat way would happen woman part study . In word , anesthesiologist obstetrician treat woman way normally would whether woman part study .</detailed_description>
