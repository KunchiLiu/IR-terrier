	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate use 2 different type biosynthetic material repair congenital diaphragmatic hernia . The research question : best material repair large congenital diaphragmatic hernia ? The primary outcome variable recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Type Material Repair Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At birth , estimate gestational age birth weight record , well presence type congenital anomaly . Prior operation , length time birth repair record . To determine severity physiologic compromise , need type ventilator support well need length ECMO support record . The amount time ECMO discontinuation repair record . The respiratory support require time operation record . At operation , size defect measure record . The location ( right versus leave ) record special notation record regard area diaphragmatic rim present . The operative time charge record . After operation , length ventilator support , time feed , hospital stay , hospital charge record . Post-operative complication bleed complication , pneumonia , sepsis , gastroesophageal reflux , early recurrence bowel obstruction record . Future operation type procedure record . If future operation abdomen require , amount severity intraperitoneal adhesion note record . Mortality record . After discharge , commensurate standard current clinical practice , patient receive follow-up appointment chest x-ray 6 month 1 year life . After time , follow-up appointment make year first 5 year life imaging obtain basis symptom . Any follow-up need symptom . Oxygen requirement , finding follow-up future hospitalization record , particularly look presence absence hernia recurrence . The study mature effectively close subject reach 5 year follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Infants admit neonatal intensive care unit diagnosis congenital diaphragmatic hernia proven chest xray show enteric content thoracic cavity consider . Those birth weight equal 2.2 kilogram beyond 34 week gestation time birth survive operation perform consider . At operation , patient posterolateral diaphragmatic defect ( Bockdalek Hernia ) large enough require placement patch recreate diaphragm include study . Children diagnose outside neonatal period consider . Patients less common anteromedial substernal defect ( Morgagni Hernia ) include study physiology rate recurrence incomparable common posterolateral , Bockdalek Hernia . Those patient 2.2 kilogram less 34 week gestation poor lung maturity compound inherent difficulty pulmonary parenchymal hypoplasia pulmonary vasculature hypertension make chance survival extremely low . Further compound dismal circumstance , candidate salvage extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . Therefore , candidate study . The rare case require repair hernia ECMO support include due fact population poor survival secondary irreversible pulmonary hypertension . Further , operation perform patient anticoagulated heparin fraught operative postoperative bleeding .</criteria>
