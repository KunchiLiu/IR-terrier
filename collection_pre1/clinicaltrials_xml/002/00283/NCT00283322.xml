	<detailed_description>Venous Thromboembolism ( VTE ) common intensive care unit ( ICU ) ; VTE lead significant morbidity fatal 30 % undiagnosed pulmonary emboli 8 % PE appropriately treat . Intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient multiple risk factor VTE tend high risk non-ICU patient . Risk factor specific ICU patient include immobility , central venous catheter , sepsis infection , need vasopressor , mechanical ventilation , surgery , trauma , increase age . Guidelines exist prevention VTE , VTE prophylaxis strongly recommend . Given high rate VTE attendant morbidity mortality , ICU 's routinely provide VTE prophylaxis individualize accord risk-benefit analysis respect thrombosis bleeding risk . Prophylaxis patient risk bleed accomplish use mechanical compression device without bleed risk administer medical prophylaxis felt effective . Recently , become apparent medical prophylaxis without risk risk-benefit analysis also include risk develop heparin induce thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) heparin induce thrombocytopenia thrombosis ( HITT ) . Unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) commonly use prevent VTE ICU non-ICU patient . HIT , untoward consequence exposure heparin immune disorder may develop patient treat heparin product . HIT antibody mediate , usually due IgG antibody direct epitope platelet surface comprise heparin-platelet factor 4 complex . HIT generally characterize decrease platelet count le 100 X 109/L , 50 % decrease baseline , exposure heparin . HIT typically observe 5 10 day treatment . Alternatively , patient previous exposure heparin develop HIT two day heparin naive patient may develop HIT 10 day . The platelet count usually return normal several day discontinue heparin without therapy , though risk thrombosis persist 3 month due persistence antibody . Using ELISA assay heparin-induced antibody formation find 50 % patient expose UFH . However , serotonin release assay ( SRA ) believe specific HIT detects antibody formation 20 % patient . Five percent patient receive UFH develop thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) half patient go develop heparin induce thrombocytopenia thrombosis ( HITT ) result venous arterial complication life threatening , result loss extremity . The occurrence HIT varies widely clinical population dependent type heparin use , i.e . UFH vs. LMWH . The high incidence report date cardiac orthopedic population unknown ICU population . Warkentin , et al find study 655 hip surgery patient 2.7 % randomize UFH develop HIT none receive enoxaparin ( LMWH ) develop HIT . This variability development antibody HIT syndrome make critically important understand heparin induce antibody formation precursor HIT HITT . Determining prevalence HIT relationship preventive therapeutic UFH LMWH help clinician appropriately choose method VTE prophylaxis treatment critically ill , ICU population . Objectives To determine prevalence heparin-induced antibody admission ICU development new heparin-antibodies first 7 +/- 2 day hospitalization . Secondary objective include : determine incidence heparin antibody formation patient treat UFH , LMWH mechanical prophylaxis ( MPX ) ; compare incidence heparin antibody different ICU population .</detailed_description>
