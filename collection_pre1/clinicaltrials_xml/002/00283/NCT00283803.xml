	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine investigational drug call Exisulind extend `` off-treatment '' period patient receive intermittent androgen suppression . There evidence suggest alternate period treatment treatment androgen suppressant may delay time develop androgen-insensitive progression improve overall quality life . During intermittent androgen suppression ( IAS ) treatment , men receive LHRH agonist antiandrogen fix period time ( approximately 9 month ) enter off-treatment period , whose length vary , depend rate rise patient 's PSA . Once PSA reach establish threshold ( 1 ng/mL men prostatectomy 4 ng/ml men intact prostate ) , androgen suppression re-initiated another 9 month . These cycle on-treatment/off-treatment repeat patient long respond androgen suppression clear cancer progress . It observe off-treatment period tend become short successive cycle androgen suppression , presumably due emergence androgen-independent clone . This study propose look exisulind , pro-apoptotic drug , may extend off-treatment period patient receive IAS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A study doctor meet ask medical history , examine , explain study . We draw blood test ( 4-6 tablespoon ) , include PSA . If already obtain , bone scan CT scan establish baseline . You receive hormone suppression treatment monthly injection LH-RH analog Lupron Zoladex antiandrogen Eulexin Casodex part standard care prostate cancer . About 3 month next `` off-treatment '' period , start 1 Exisulind pill 250 mg ( 2 x 125mg capsule ) mouth twice day . It necessary start Exisulind treatment 3 month prior next `` off-treatment '' period medication build system enough effective . Per standard follow-up procedure , ask blood draw every 2 week 12 week start Exisulind check liver function . Thereafter ask monthly blood draw , return clinic every 3 month physical examination , determine well tolerate study medication , cancer respond treatment , give study medication . You continue take Exisulind `` off-treatment '' period PSA reach threshold level . PSA threshold defined primary treatment . If prostate remove , threshold 1.0 ng/dL . If intact prostate , threshold 4 ng/dL . Once PSA reach level , restart hormone suppression treatment direct doctor .</detailed_description>
