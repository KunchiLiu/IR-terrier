	<detailed_description>Study design The different objective address complex design several sub-studies . Part A randomised control trial compare intervention group offer home-sampling recieve package mail ( contain information urogenital C.trachomatis infection , sample eqiupment urine test questionnaire ) control group continue today system conventional sampling doctores office ( intervention ) . The study population men woman 18-25 year age Rogaland County Norway . The population register use randomly assigne either intervention group control group.The intervention group ask take urine sample send mail laboratory analysis within three month invitation , fill return questionnaire . For one control group sample ( urethral cervical swab urine sample ) take within three month sendt laboratory . In part study measure yield ratio test , diagnose treat two groupsafter study period three month . All sample either obtain home physician 's office , analyze BDProbeTec ET Chlamydia Amplified DNA assay . This well document Nucleid Acid amplification method . Samples analyse accord manufacture instruction . Data number test diagnosed two group collect Stvanger University Hospital . Data number treat collected Norwegain Prescription Database merge study dataset datafiles . This way recive information receive treatment C.rachomatis within one month positive C.trachomatis test . In Part B case-cohort intervention group ( Part A ) consist random selection respondent non-respondents used determine feasibility home sample screen strategy measure risk ( OR ) relate different factor determine response . Data collect selfadminitered questionnaire . Part C cross sectional study consist respondent intervention group . In part measure Prevalence Ratio ( PR ) urogential C.trachomatis infection associate different factor compare C.trachomatis positive C.trachomatis negative intervention group .
