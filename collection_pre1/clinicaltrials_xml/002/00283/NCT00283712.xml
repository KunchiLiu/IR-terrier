	<brief_title>Use Infliximab Treatment Pemphigus Vulgaris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PV involve blister outer layer skin mucous membrane , cause separation epidermal cell . The disease occur immune system produce antibody specific protein skin mucous membrane ; cause production autoantibody unknown . Infliximab genetically engineer monoclonal antibody direct tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha , chemical messenger activate immune response . Infliximab use treat autoimmune disorder , include rheumatoid arthritis , ankylose spondylitis , Crohn 's disease . This study evaluate safety efficacy infliximab give combination prednisone treatment adult PV . This study last 26 week . At study entry , patient take stable dose prednisone ( equivalent corticosteroid ) 20 120 mg/day least 2 week prior study entry . Patients randomly assign one two arm : experimental placebo comparator . The experimental treatment arm receive infusion infliximab , control arm receive placebo . Infusions give study entry Weeks 2 , 6 , 14 . Before start infusion , physical exam , vital sign measurement , medical medication history , review disease activity log , skin evaluation , blood collection occur . During infusion 1 hour postinfusion , patient ' vital sign monitor adverse event . Patients need responsible adult take home discharge treatment facility ; person remain patient overnight case problem arise treatment . The patient contact phone night next morning infusion ask adverse effect may experience . Those patient experience adverse effect may ask return treatment facility examination . Prednisone dos may taper 15 percent every 2 week study investigator 's discretion . There total 9 study visit Week 26 : screening , study entry , Week 2 , every 4 week thereafter . Each study visit include physical exam , vital sign measurement , medical medication history , review disease activity log adverse event experience since last visit , skin assessment , blood collection ; patient also ask complete tuberculosis ( TB ) questionnaire . Patients ask complete quality life questionnaire study entry Weeks 10 , 18 , 26 . Skin biopsy unaffected skin do study entry Weeks 10 , 18 , 26 ; patient PV-associated lesion , additional skin biopsy affect skin do study entry Week 18 .</detailed_description>
