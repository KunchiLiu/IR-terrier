	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan effective safe treatment thermal burn non-injured skin skin graft harvest . Hypothesis : Soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan immunomodulating activity improve wound heal thermal burn non-injured skin skin graft harvest .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In severe case , burn patient commonly exhibit clinical picture systemic inflammation variety manifestation range presence tachycardia , tachypnea , fever leukocytosis , may progress refractory hypotension . Shock multiple organ system dysfunction may subsequently occur . Sepsis , cause infection bacteremia , also common occurrence major complication burn patient . After cool burn area , pain control important . Local burn wound care start cleanse wound follow application topical agent prevent infection . Such agent may adverse local systemic effect may impede wound heal process . The use synthetic biologic material wind cover become increasingly popular , clinical information efficacy product anecdotal . A primary objective burn care wound heal within 1 month . With long heal period , increase likelihood develop hypertropic scar alteration pigmentation . The development effective wound healing agent would therefore highly beneficial suffer patient term decrease heal time improve cosmetic result .</detailed_description>
