	<brief_summary>This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBRs ) brain . PBRs initially find peripheral organ kidney , endocrine gland lung , later study identify PBRs CNS . PBRs marker detect nervous system inflammation . Development test image PBRs may improve management brain disorder multiple sclerosis , Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , others inflammation involve progression disease . Healthy volunteer 18 40 year old may eligible study . Candidates screen test may include follow : diagnostic interview ; rating mood , anxiety , functioning , parameter ; neuropsychological testing ; physical examination ; electrocardiogram ; blood urine test ; personal , social family history . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Evaluation : Subjects provide medical history , include detailed question psychological health , physical examination blood urine test . - PET scanning : PET us small amount radioactive chemical call tracer `` label '' active area brain . The tracer use study [ 11C ] PBR28 . For procedure , subject lie scanner bed . A special mask fit head attach bed help keep head still scan image clear . A brief scan do radioactive tracer inject provide measure brain help precisely calculate information subsequent scan . After tracer inject catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm , picture take 2 3 hour , subject lie still scanner bed . Subjects return clinic follow day blood urine sample collection . - MRI : The MRI scan do within 1 year PET scan ( either PET ) . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . The patient lie table move scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . He communicate staff time procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Imaging Brain Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) distinct central benzodiazepine receptor associate GABA ( A ) receptor . Although PBR initially identify peripheral organ kidney , endocrine gland lung , later study identify PBR central nervous system . In normal condition , PBR express low level neuron glial cell . PBR clinically useful marker detect neuroinflammation activate microglial cell inflammatory area express much great level PBR microglial cell rest condition . PBR image positron emission tomography ( PET ) use [ ( 11 ) C ] 1- ( 2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl ) -3-isoquinoline carboxamide ( PK11195 ) . However , classical ligand provide low level specific signal sensitive detect change occur vivo . Recently develop new ligand , N-acetyl-N- ( 2-methoxybenzyl ) -2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 , show much great specific signal [ ( 11 ) C ] PK11195 non-human primate . In present protocol , plan perform kinetic brain imaging study healthy human subject measure PBR brain region [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 . Successful development PET ligand image PBR strong impact clinical management brain disorder inflammation multiple sclerosis ischemia neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer 's Parkinson 's disease inflammation involve disease progression .</detailed_description>
