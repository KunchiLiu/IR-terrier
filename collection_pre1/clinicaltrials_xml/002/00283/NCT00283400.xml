	<brief_title>Treatment Subarachnoid Hemorrhage With Human Albumin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimated 37,500 people United States subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) every year . SAH usually secondary brain aneurysm burst . In SAH bleed accumulates around line brain . SAH associate 51percent mortality rate , one third survivor leave functionally dependent . Cerebral vasospasm , delay narrow cerebral artery follow SAH , identify important reason neurological deterioration bad outcome case SAH . Cerebral vasospasm may cause multiple mechanism . Treatment neuroprotective agent , human albumin ( HA ) , may beneficial prevention cerebral vasospasm improve clinical outcome patient SAH . HA major protein find blood responsible maintain fluid balance vascular system ( blood vessel ) . The purpose study determine safety tolerability 25 percent HA therapy patient SAH . This open-label , dose-escalation study provide necessary information future definitive phase III clinical trial efficacy treatment HA patient SAH . The study design enroll 80 patient 5 center US . Patients eligible SAH first underwent surgical endovascular repair , consider standard care . Endovascular repair repair aneurysm inside blood vessel . Following neurosurgical endovascular treatment , participant give daily infusion HA 7 day . The HA dose allocate follow : first tier ( 20 patient ) would receive 0.625 gram ( g ) HA per kilogram ( kg ) body weight ; patient second tier would receive 1.25g HA per kg ; patient third tier would receive 1.875g HA per kg ; patient fourth tier would receive 2.5g HA per kg . Safety tolerability evaluate Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) tier complete study advance next dose tier . A specific safety threshold congestive heart failure adverse event define base data previous study . In follow-up phase , patient participate study-related evaluation health 15 day three month . Duration study participant 90 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients ( male female ) least 18 young 80 year age . Onset new neurological sign subarachnoid hemorrhage within 72 hour time evaluation initiation treatment 25 % human albumin . Clinical sign consistent diagnosis subarachnoid hemorrhage include severe thunderclap headache , cranial nerve abnormality , decrease level consciousness , meningismus focal neurological deficit . Computed tomography demonstrate subarachnoid hemorrhage . Cerebral angiography reveal presence saccular aneurysm ( ) location explain subarachnoid hemorrhage . Treatment cerebral aneurysm carry prior initiation HA infusion within 72 hour symptom onset . Accepted treatment aneurysms include surgical clip endovascular embolization . Time symptom onset could reliably assess . No demonstrable aneurysm cerebral angiography . Evidence traumatic , mycotic , fusiform aneurysm cerebral angiography . World Federation Neurological Surgeons scale IV V Computed tomography scale 01 History within past 6 month , and/or physical finding admission decompensated congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class IV congestive heart failure require hospitalization ) . Patient receive albumin prior treatment assignment present admission . Hospitalization diagnosis acute myocardial infarction within precede 3 month . Symptoms electrocardiographic sign indicative acute myocardial infarction admission . Electrocardiographic evidence and/or physical finding compatible second thirddegree heart block , cardiac arrhythmia associate hemodynamic instability . Echocardiogram perform treatment revealing leave ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤ 40 % ( available ) . Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min . Pregnancy , lactation parturition within previous 30 day . Allergy albumin . Severe prior physical disability precludes evaluation clinical outcome measure . History chronic lung disease Current participation another drug treatment protocol . Severe terminal disease life expectancy le 6 month .</criteria>
