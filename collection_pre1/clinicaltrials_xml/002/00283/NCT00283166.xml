	<detailed_description>Background : A small , randomized trial conduct 2001 , supply preliminary evidence carefully structure , one-time individualized education coach intervention potential provide important clinical benefit patient suffer cancer-related pain . The study explore impact intervention large , diverse patient population ; duration intervention 's benefit ; pathway benefit achieve . This project attempt address issue build literature exist palliation physician-patient communication . Objective/Hypothesis : The main objective research reduce barrier pain control create effective partnership patient health care provider . Specific Aims : The aim study : 1 ) compare effect pain , cancer-related symptom , health-related quality life standard educational intervention versus face-to-face , tailor education coaching ; 2 ) estimate effect tailor education coach self-efficacy pain self-management participation care ; 3 ) examine mechanism underlie beneficial effect intervention . Study Design : The propose study randomize , control trial compare `` education '' tailor education coach patient activation ( TEC ) . Eligible patient schedule see oncologist three participate health system invite participate study . Consenting patient randomly allocate TEC education . The intervention apply brief session schedule oncology visit . Allocation conceal physician , interviewer , data analyst . Patients assign usual care group review content standard informational booklet cancer pain . A health educator review key learn point available answer question . Patients assign TEC group receive intervention design improve self-efficacy pain self-management participation care . Data collect patient private wait alcove prior index visit ( personal interview ) ; index visit ( audio-taping ) ; two , six , 12 week visit ( phone interview ) . In addition assess effectiveness intervention , study design measure potential mediator intermediate outcome ( attitude , belief , self-efficacy , patient participation , quality care , adherence ) examine mechanism underlie intervention 's beneficial effect . The study contribute test Social Cognitive Theory examine whether benefit intervention powerfully attenuate change attitude beliefs change self-efficacy . Cancer Relevance : Uncontrolled cancer pain remain prevalent . An estimated 90 % patient cancer experience least moderate pain point illness , 42 % patient receive adequate palliation . Aside impair quality life , uncontrolled pain contribute depression , increase likelihood suicide , decrease patient acceptance potentially beneficial therapy . The propose project valuable confirm benefit patient coaching , elucidate mechanism , test Social Cognitive Theory . The propose model enlarge exist research pain management : ( 1 ) pilot test , easily implementable intervention ( 2 ) applicable outpatient setting , ( 3 ) base strong theory make prediction mechanism benefit , ( 4 ) focus patient activation well education .</detailed_description>
