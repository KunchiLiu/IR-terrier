	<detailed_description>The purpose research study evaluate Endeavor , compact , forward-folding , ultralight manual wheelchair incorporate small `` swing-down '' wheel navigation confine area . This enable access narrow environment encounter office , restroom , transportation setting . When use small access wheel , wheelchair also fit aisle airplane collapse stow overhead compartment . It anticipate Endeavor maximize mobility ; increase access confined area ; ease demand travel people disability . There two stage research project : Activities Daily Living Course In-Home trial . The activity daily live course locate Human Engineering Research Laboratories simulate daily barrier encounter wheelchair user . Subjects ask complete course personal wheelchair Endeavor three time . Testing complete one-day visit exceed 2 1/2 hour . For in-home trial , subject ask use Endeavor primary mean mobility two week , compare use wheelchair two week . During four-week period datalogger mount subject 's wheelchair ( ) , give information distance travel , average speed , time use . In addition data-logger , subject also ask keep brief , daily , write log activity perform chair . At end Endeavor trial-use period , subject ask complete questionnaire . There 8-week follow-up period subject allow keep Endeavor . We make three call period conduct interview usage Endeavor .</detailed_description>
