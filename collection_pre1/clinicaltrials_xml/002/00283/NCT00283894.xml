	<brief_summary>This study measure energy expenditure ( rate body burn calorie ) , physical activity caloric intake people narcolepsy learn risk become overweight diabetic may affect . Healthy control subject people narcolepsy 18 55 year age may eligible study . Participants withdraw narcolepsy medication undergo follow test procedures 5 week resume medication . - Blood draw genetic study . - Collection cerebrospinal fluid sample . - Diet keep subject ' weight constant . - Activity watch , use device worn wrist measure amount movement , activity monitor worn waist measure physical activity caloric expenditure . - Questionnaires sleepiness , symptom , food intake , exercise mood . - 24-hour urine collection 24-hour blood draw measure hormone . - Glucose tolerance test . The subject drink sugar solution blood sample collect catheter drink solution 30 minute , 1 , 2 3 hour drink . - Startle reflex test . Subjects hear loud noise headphone ask look picture . - Sleep study evaluate sleep-related breathing disturbance record information sleep stage . - Indirect calorimetry test measure fast body use calorie . A plastic canopy place face several minute capture air exhale analyze oxygen use . To measure energy associate meal , measurement take subject eats lunch . - CT scan abdomen see much fat deposit abdomen , DEXA scan whole body see percentage fat muscle . - Plethysmography . Participants sit enclosed chamber mass volume body measure change air pressure . - Neuropsychological test ass thought process . - Continuous 24-hour heart rate measurement . - Metabolic chamber . Subjects spend 24 hour small room measure amount oxygen inhale carbon dioxide exhale . - Walking/running test ass level physical conditioning . - Dexamethasone CRH ( corticotropin-releasing hormone ) suppression test CRH stimulation test . Subjects receive eight dos 0.5 mg dexamethasone every 6 hour day half . After last dose , two blood sample draw , dose CRH inject , six blood sample draw next 3 hour . - TRH ( thyrotropin-releasing hormone ) stimulation test . Subjects give TRH vein , several blood sample draw next 3 hour . - Doubly label water test . Subjects drink dose `` heavy '' water . Urine sample collect 2 , 3 5 hour drink two 4-hour collection week later .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Several cross-sectional study suggest subject narcolepsy increase body mass index ( BMI ) insulin resistance . These subject exhibit decrease cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) orexin level , causally link clinical manifestation disease . Orexins peptide express brain region , lateral hypothalamic area , stimulate appetite modulate sleep . Low CSF orexin level provoke narcolepsy-like behavior , excessive daytime sleepiness sudden loss muscle tone know cataplexy . OBJECTIVES : The primary objective study determine whether subject narcolepsy low energy expenditure compare healthy match control . In addition , ass food intake , physical activity , relevant parameter . STUDY POPULATION : 18 55 year old men premenopausal woman narcolepsy healthy match control DESIGN : This cross-sectional , case-controlled study subject narcolepsy match one-to-one basis healthy , non-narcoleptic control subject . OUTCOME PARAMETERS : We assess metabolic , hormonal , energy expenditure parameter subject narcolepsy . Outcomes : energy expenditure various method ( indirect calorimetry , metabolic chamber , doubly-labeled water method ) ; leptin circadian level ( frequent 24h sample ) ; physical activity , characterization main endocrine ax , relevant parameter .</detailed_description>
