	<brief_title>Efficacy Betaine Reduction Urine Oxalate Patients With Type 1 Primary Hyperoxaluria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our prior genotyping result show association G170R allele clinical response VB6 . Patients homozygous change show complete response heterozygous patient partial response . Since VB6 safe completely effective treatment patient homozygous G170R , study betaine group . Instead , 20 participant old 6 year age G170R compound heterozygous , non-G170R missense truncate sequence change homozygous heterozygous , select enrollment . Participants VB6 provide partial reduction urine oxalate excretion ( compound heterozygotes G170R mutation ) maintain stable dose VB6 ( 8 mg/kg/d ) two month throughout betaine treatment . Those demonstrated response VB6 receive betaine alone . Participants randomize receive either betaine placebo first 2 month arm study . Following 2 month treatment 2 month washout , participant cross arm study . The arm consist participant 2 month treatment whatever take first arm ( betaine vs. placebo ) . Neither study staff participant know whether participant take betaine first second arm study , placebo first second arm study . Only pharmacy know . Prior study , complete history physical examination , baseline laboratory study pertinent routine care primary hyperoxaluria patient perform ( Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) differential , chemistry group , electrolytes , plasma oxalate creatinine clearance , urinary supersaturation ) . All woman capable reproduction receive pregnancy test prior enrollment . Participant complete two 24-hour urine collection calcium oxalate super-saturation ( include 24-hour urine oxalate excretion ) baseline , inclusive creatinine determination assessment completeness . They begin Cystadane anhydrous solution ( 12 grams/day subject young 10 year age , 20 grams/day subject 10 year age old , two divide dos ) . These dos betaine show effectively treat pediatric patient VB6-resistant homocystinuria reverse Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH ) adult patient , expect achieve sufficient intra-hepatocyte level effect PHI . A sample 24-hour urine store frozen ( -80ÂºC ) allow determination indicator oxidant stress , urinary oxalate fall . If effective , betaine could represent new safe treatment option subset PHI patient , particularly either partially VB6 responsive VB6 refractory hyperoxaluria , adverse effect peripheral neuropathy large dos VB6 . We anticipate adverse medication effect specific primary hyperoxaluria . However , extra safeguard child PHI , ten subject older 15 year age test first agent well tolerated PHI patient , pediatric subject older 6 year age recruit participation .</detailed_description>

A pregnancy test obtain entry prior initiation treatment must negative . Female patient must breastfeed . Sexually active male patient must practice acceptable method contraception treatment period 6 month discontinuation therapy . 7 . Written inform consent participation study . 1 . Patients fully VB6 responsive ( i.e. , G170R homozygotes ) . 2 . Prior recipient liver transplantation perform correction AGT deficiency . 3 . Pregnancy breastfeed 4 . Unwillingness patient and/or partner use contraception treatment . 5 . Malignant disease ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) previous two year . 6 .
