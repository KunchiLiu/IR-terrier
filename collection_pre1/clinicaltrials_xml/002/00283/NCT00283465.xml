	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Safety Treatment With Epoetin Alfa Hemoglobin Levels , Red Blood Cell Transfusions , Quality Life Patients With Cancer Receiving Platinum-containing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer patient often experience anemia due disease , chemotherapy , . Quality life also affect , due part tiredness associate anemia . Previous study epoetin alfa suggest epoetin alfa increase hemoglobin reduces incidence red blood cell transfusion achieve high hemoglobin level may improve quality life . This randomized , open-label , multicenter study evaluate effect early treatment epoetin alfa compare standard anemia care alone determine impact need blood transfusion , tumor response , anemia quality life , well safety epoetin alfa use prevention anemia chemotherapy adult patient cancer . Patients receive epoetin alfa injection ( 10,000 unit ) skin 3 time week 4 week last day last chemotherapy cycle , addition best standard care , best standard care alone . Best standard care chemotherapy may include red blood cell transfusion , white cell growth factor , iron supplementation , need . The dose epoetin alfa may adjust ( 20,000 unit ) ( 75 % last dose ) base hemoglobin level . The primary measure effectiveness determine number patient receive allogenic red blood cell transfusion study chemotherapy cycle . Additional measure effectiveness include : average number unit transfuse cycle , change quality life ( feel well-being , assess response 3 different patient questionnaire ) , change hemoglobin level , relationship change hemoglobin quality life , tumor response , number patient survive 12 month end treatment . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , physical examination ) perform throughout study . The study hypothesis treatment epoetin alfa reduce need red blood cell transfusion , increase hemoglobin level , improve quality life , result positive tumor response patient cancer receive chemotherapy . This study conduct Netherlands enroll European patient . Patients receive epoetin alfa injection ( 10,000 unit ) skin 3 time week 4 week last day last chemotherapy cycle , best standard care . Dose may adjust ( 20,000 unit ) ( 75 % last dose ) base hemoglobin level .</detailed_description>
