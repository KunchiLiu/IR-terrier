	<brief_title>Trial Primary Prophylaxis With rhTPO Administered Patients With High Risk Sarcoma Receiving Intensive Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate effectiveness intravenous rhTPO vs. placebo primary prophylaxis reduce cumulative proportion patient require platelet transfusion severe chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 15,000 ) first four study cycle . To evaluate severity duration thrombocytopenia neutropenia associate rhTPO prophylaxis , impact rhTPO prophylaxis health economics/cost effectiveness , patient quality life . To assess safety multiple IV dose rhTPO .</detailed_description>
