	<brief_title>MIST II PFO-Migraine Trial With BioSTARÂ® Bioabsorbable Septal Repair Implant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During last five year , transcatheter surgical closure PFO cyrptogenic stroke TIA population grown frequency world-wide . Observational retrospective report , single multi-center experience 400 patient , suggest Patent Foramen Ovale ( PFO ) closure reduce risk recurrent migraine event population may beneficial , particularly patient migraine aura subgroup . Although none report prospective , randomize , control trial , report compel enough totality support investigation well define group prospective manner . The patient report study bring PFO closure expectation procedure impact migraine . In fact , many case , discovery history migraine make well PFO closure procedure . This clinical trial prospectively compare safety effectiveness PFO closure BioSTAR device control arm . Patients follow one year post-implant .</detailed_description>
