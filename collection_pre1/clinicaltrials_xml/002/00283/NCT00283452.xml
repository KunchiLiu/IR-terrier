	<detailed_description>The benefit physical activity adult well establish , less one-third older adult U.S. achieve recommended level physical activity despite widespread clinical recommendation increase physical activity recent year . Clinic-based approach increase physical activity expensive , difficult implement busy practice setting , limited reach . Moreover , evidence efficacy approach equivocal . A population base approach may effective less costly strategy increase level physical activity old adult . Population study physical activity demonstrate year , many sedentary old adult initiate physical activity , nearly equal number active become sedentary . Among old adult initiate physical activity , half continue active 3 month later . We hypothesize population base approach emphasize physical activity maintenance substantially increase physical activity level define population old adult . This hypothesis test 24-month randomized trial evaluate innovative , theory-based behavioral intervention maintain physical activity random sample 50-70 year old adult recently become least moderately active . One thousand ( 1000 ) subject randomized one two experimental group : 1 ) `` usual care '' control group , 2 ) interactive phone- mail-based intervention program tailor maintain physical activity old adult . The primary outcome measure : 1 ) physical activity , assess kcals/wk expenditure ; 2 ) physical activity maintenance , assess follow-up kcals/wk expenditure relative baseline . Careful measurement penetration intervention well characterize old adult population , cost intervention , assess . Psychosocial behavioral mediator physical activity maintenance also examine . Study result relevant policy maker , health promotion practitioner health plan , provide practical information effectiveness , population penetration , cost intervention design maximize population level physical activity among old adult .</detailed_description>
