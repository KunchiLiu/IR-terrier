	<brief_summary>This phase 1 trial evaluate safety toxicity mouse kidney cancer cell-containing agarose-agarose macrobeads implant abdominal cavity propose biological treatment patient end-stage , treatment-resistant cancer . The macrobeads extensively test tumor model mouse rat , well forty-five veterinary patient ( cat dog ) naturally occur tumor various type include breast cancer , prostate cancer , liver cancer , lymphoma clear tumor response significant detectable toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cancer various form continue major U.S. health problem , account 550,000 deaths year , well much disability suffer . Treatment cancer traditionally consist three modality : surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy . Advances three modality year produce long-term remission and/or cure certain type cancer leukemia , prolong survival many patient . Much remain accomplished , however , especially respect treatment solid tumor , include common cancer lung , colon , breast , ovary , prostate kidney . New type less toxic debilitate therapy need . Among therapeutic possibility currently explore , involve biological control mechanism seem promise attractive . Although long thought cancer cell subject regulatory growth control mechanisms function normal cell , substantial body evidence respond feedback signal tell slow stop growth . In addition , determine relatively small population cell within tumor ( cancer `` stem '' progenitor cell ) responsible continued tumor growth cell must control biological anti-tumor therapy effective . The proposed cancer treatment test Phase 1 clinical trial base concept tumor growth control tumor mass signal indicate mass present . In case , however , induction growth-slowing signal bring tumor mass , place mouse kidney cancer cell agarose matrix , selects cancer progenitor cell also cause produce release signal inhibit growth freely grow cancer cell different type laboratory dish tumor-bearing animal human ( i.e . also species-specific ) . This approach proven safe effective animal model veterinary patient , first stage human test . With Phase 1 complete , implement Phase 2 efficacy trial present focused colorectal cancer , pancreatic cancer , prostate cancer . The Phase 1 trial remain open range epithelial-derived cancer .</detailed_description>
