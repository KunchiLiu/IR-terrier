	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicenter , open-label , randomized phase III study participant high risk recurrent prostate cancer radical prostatectomy . The study investigate - Treatment docetaxel ( TAXOTERE® ) every three week ( q3w ) plus leuprolide acetate ( ELIGARD® ) versus leuprolide acetate alone ( ELIGARD® ) - Immediate treatment follow prostatectomy versus defer treatment time relapse Using 2x2 factorial design participant therefore randomize - Immediate adjuvant treatment docetaxel plus leuprolide acetate ( chemotherapy hormonal therapy ) - Immediate adjuvant treatment leuprolide acetate alone ( hormonal therapy ) - Deferred treatment docetaxel plus leuprolide acetate ( chemotherapy hormonal therapy ) - Deferred treatment leuprolide acetate alone ( hormonal therapy ) Primary Objective : - The primary objective study compare progression-free survival use 2x2 factorial design Secondary Objectives : - To compare 5-year overall , cancer-specific metastasis-free survival systemic treatment group - To compare safety tolerability Docetaxel combination leuprolide acetate leuprolide acetate alone . - To evaluate quality life measure FACT-P questionnaire . Originally , 1696 participant plan study ( 424 participant randomized arm ) . However , total 211 participant complete randomization procedure 26 September 2007 . Thus , sanofi-aventis , accordance Steering Committee , decide stop participant recruitment 26 September 2007 . Participants already sign Informed Consent ( IC ) September 26 , 2007 allow enter randomization meet eligibility criterion . The final revise number plan participant randomly assign 4 treatment arm 250 , 228 participant actually randomize . The final sample size allow statistical analysis conduct efficacy data . Therefore , protocol amend reflect change plan statistical analysis . The study underpowered serve basis draw conclusion regard efficacy quality life ( QoL ) endpoint .</brief_summary>
