	<brief_title>New Strategies Non-invasive Detection Chronic Allograft Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize patient CAN manifest different pattern gene expression profile ( compare non-CAN control ) , detectable peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) urine cell . By study difference exist peripheral blood graft local environment ( urine sample ) , informative biomarkers may discover improve treatment program . Specific Aims : AIM 1 : To investigate gene involve molecular mechanism characterize CAN kidney transplant recipient , study gene expression kidney biopsy sample patient CAN . For comparison analysis , study gene expression profile normal kidney biopsy ( Control Group 1 ) . AIM 2 : To determine whether role assess peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) urine cell gene expression pattern mean measure immunologic clinical status kidney transplant recipient , compare gene expression profile among PBMC , urine biopsy sample . AIM 3 : To establish clinical utility set marker result AIMS 1 2 diagnostic CAN , use `` real time '' ( RT ) -PCR PBMC urine sample employ limited panel marker independent group patient . AIM 4 : To study role pre-established panel molecular marker early detection CAN patient receive mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) immunosuppressive treatment , study urine PBMC sample patient 12 month post-transplantation , normal creatinine , proteinuria . Background Significance : Chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) devastate complication kidney transplantation responsible significant proportion graft loss ( 1-5 ) . Although currently available immunosuppressive therapy increasingly effective acute rejection transplant organ , chronic rejection ( CR ) remain difficult treat . Nevertheless , relevant proportion patient CR kidney transplant maintain satisfactory organ function long time . CAN characterize progressive decline kidney function , attributable specific cause ( 6-8 ) . CAN poorly know complex process result yet undefined etiology immune non-immune component ( 8 ) . Alloantigen-dependent cause CAN include acute rejection episode , particularly multiple , late , vascular acute rejection episode ( 9-13 ) . With use new immunosuppressive regimen , frequency acute rejection episodes become reduced , may possibly influence future development CAN . However , donor antigen-independent factor also play role occurrence progression CAN . This include donor-related factor donor age number mismatch , impact late graft outcome ( 13 ) . Donation-related circumstance , prolong cold ischemia time , associate delayed graft function relate poor late renal transplant result . Recipient related factor may also act co-factors contribute accelerated deterioration functional unit kidney , include vascular , renal artery subsequent relative hypoxia kidney , frequently lead interstitial fibrosis . Interestingly , many pathway involve chronic injury fibrosis regulate early course injury , downstream effect alteration still evident pathology . The histopathologic feature CAN characterize proliferative change vascular wall , smooth muscle cell parenchymal cell proliferate , lead narrow renal artery , may contribute relative hypoxia tissue . Subsequently , fibroblast contribute fibrotic scarring vascular wall . CAN also characterize occurrence fibrosis interstitial tissue along tubular atrophy ( 14 ) . The glomerulus also often affect various degree glomerulosclerosis . An inflammatory infiltrate frequently find consists invade lymphocyte monocytes-macrophages virtually affect compartment kidney . The inflammatory infiltrate observe CAN induce antigen-dependent antigen-independent factor . These histopathologic change grade accord Banff system ( 14 ) , give score degree CAN . These histopathologic change act concert , contribute gradual progression renal allograft dysfunction . Fundamental study solid organ transplantation characterize specific functional role individual gene immunological cascade lead organ rejection . Nevertheless , significant redundancy immune system suggest clinical variability acute rejection outcome , progression chronic rejection , potential acquire graft tolerance . Underlying complex system concordant expression co-regulation multiple gene know novel molecular pathway . Ascertaining individual function adapt effector response possible gene expression profile use microarrays . Although cDNA microarrays ( large number gene represent complementary DNAs oligonucleotides immobilize onto microscope slide silicon chip ) successfully use profile gene expression cancer ( 15,16,17,18,19 ) , impact transplantation research far relatively modest . I suggest highlight section delete , least placed parenthesis . It make sentence difficult understand , though I know meant clarify . There accumulate evidence non-invasive immune monitoring may useful early period renal transplant ( 20,21 ) , particularly regard predict presence acute rejection . It less clear whether chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) also associate consistent change peripheral blood urine cell . Moreover , current method diagnose allograft dysfunction inadequate detecting significant organ damage occur prior establishment clinical manifestation . The development assay novel technology allow detection allograft dysfunction/rejection , monitor response therapy , predict long-term outcome vital success transplantation . In project propose establish molecular marker characterize CAN use gene expression profile kidney biopsy patient CAN relate finding profile PBMC urine sample patient . In addition , establish validate ( independent group patient ) clinical utility limit set molecular marker , result microarray analysis , use RT-PCR . V. Statistical Analysis : Data Security Plan Kidney tissue , PBMC urine kidney transplant patient without CAN study . A Secure Data Base contain demographic information patient keep Virginia Commonwealth University , patient identifier remove study number assign patient . The tissue require include kidney biopsy patient CAN . Human Subjects : A . Description Research Materials Kidney tissue obtain informed consent patient clinical suspicion CAN ( least 15 patient ) . Tissue sample ( needle biopsy ) snap-frozen liquid nitrogen within 5 minute excision ship appropriate condition , dry ice , maintain specimen integrity . All sample submit pathological evaluation , pathology report clinical summary sent sample case manner insure patient confidentiality remove patient identifier label assigned patient number . Peripheral blood urine sample ( 1-2 tb ) obtain patient biopsy time . Kidney biopsy obtain informed consent normal kidney transplantation ( needle biopsy donor kidney , N=10 ) . Peripheral blood urine sample collect monthly 1 year inform consent kidney transplant patient diagnostic CAN confirm biopsy . As Control Group , stable long-term transplant patient ( 12 month post-TX ) creatinine level &lt; 1.6 mg/dL , proteinuria le 500mg/24hs , study . ( You may want give estimate number patient include Control Group ) All practice deal human subject perform accord ethical guideline Institutional Review Board Protection Human Subjects Virginia Commonwealth University . Recruitment Plan Patients see VCU Hume-Lee Transplant Clinic qualify accord inclusion/exclusion criterion ask participate study . B . Potential Risks When blood drawn risk bruising , bleeding , swell infection site blood drawn . Kidney biopsies painful needle enters body , bruise form . Bleeding occur needle insert kidney . Blood appear urine . Every effort make maintain confidentiality . All identify information keep secure data bank access limit research personnel . C. Risk Reduction The tissue obtain upon tissue biopsy part sample would obtain diagnostic purpose specifically protocol . The blood sample obtain time venous access already place . A urine sample collect prior biopsy . All staff member handle tissue , PBMC urine sample train qualified safely handle HCV infect tissue . D. Risk/Benefit Because treatment study , specific risk study subject . CAN diagnose treated way , whether participate study . There guarantee patient benefit participation study . The knowledge gain may invaluable future particularly diagnose CAN . D. Compensation Plan Subjects compensate participation study . E. Consent Issues Patients meet study requirement consent .</detailed_description>
