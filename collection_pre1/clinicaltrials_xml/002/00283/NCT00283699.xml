	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Neurocysticercosis Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurocysticercosis—a disease young tapeworm infect brain—is common much develop world . It affect approximately 1 every 10 people United States say primary cause adult-onset epilepsy . The infection create cyst brain , cause seizure headache among symptom . To date successful preventive treatment neurocysticercosis exist . At present , medicine kill adult tapeworm stomach intestine also use treat neurocysticercosis cause young tapeworm . However , case neurocysticercosis , method administration , dos , duration treatment medicine still determine . Although medicine may kill worm brain rapidly natural mechanism body , long-term benefit use medicine eliminate worm first 1 2 month clear . In addition , drug kill worm may associate increase seizure headache treatment , may cause inflammation meninges—the cover brain—leading symptom may require surgery . The goal trial determine treatment antiparasitic agent albendazole improve outcome neurocysticercosis infection . This trial also determine albendazole lead disappearance cyst sooner compare symptomatic treatment . Participants randomly assign receive either study medication , albendazol , placebo , inactive substance , 8-day inpatient outpatient therapy period . Additionally , participant receive prednisolone , corticosteroid , well medication . Participants remain care doctor 2 year regularly schedule visit test . Information learn study may lead improved treatment neurocysticercosis .</detailed_description>
