Participants receive information use RESPeRATE pace respiration trained staff member practice use RESPeRATE clinic visit . Participants also instruct record hot flash diary . The intervention consist use RESPeRATE device 15 minute daily . Outcomes assess clinic 3 week 6 week use device . The main efficacy outcome change number hot flash per week change hot flash score ( number flash x mean severity ) baseline 3 6 week post-training , report 7-day diary . Frequency hot flash also measure baseline 6 week use 24-hour ambulatory hot flash monitor . Change breathe rate calculate baseline 3 6 week change sleep quality life baseline 6 week measure validated self-administered questionnaire .
