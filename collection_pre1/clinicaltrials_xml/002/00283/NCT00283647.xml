	<brief_summary>Exposure lead pregnancy , infancy , childhood increase individual likelihood impaired school performance , increase impulsiveness , aggression , delinquent behavior . Disorders result exposure environmental neurotoxicants complex web interaction genetic , neurochemical , biochemical , environmental social factor influence child critical period development . To date , research area human developmental neurotoxicology focus primarily global measure sensory-motor development cognition . However , study elucidate biological basis developmental behavioral disorder due environmental toxicant exposure lack . Although gross brain structure appear normal , underlying problem exist neural level . Our proposal seek relate childhood environmental lead exposure various level stage development detriment brain structure neurochemical functioning assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . Cortical subcortical brain volume determine high resolution MRI . Neuronal glial cell marker measure use proton MRS . These structural chemical measure also correlate behavioral measure young adult participant Cincinnati Lead Study ( CLS ) . These participant represent unique ideal cohort approximately 240 subject detailed history exposure behavioral outcome lead expose child monitor approximately 20 year . A pilot study examine language , work memory attention combination functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) also perform good understand functional behavioral deficit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview Imaging All MRI MRS investigation acquire 1.5 clinical MR scanner . The MRI MRS procedure take approximately half-hour complete . Subjects also fMRI perform require another scanning session research 3T MR scanner one hour completion . Orientation scan procedure take place visit Imaging Research Center , upon completion inform consent . The subject give brief introduction general MR scanning procedure demonstration MRI machinery . Prior begin study , subject allow familiarize scanner decrease anxiety experiment . Subjects receive instruction practice appropriate behavior necessary successful MR study . The research MR technologist 10 year experience pediatric neuroimaging take great care make subject comfortable head coil remain motionless possible duration scan . The subject ask select video watch give video goggles focus adjust fit , immediately upon enter scanner room . Once table , subject 's head restrain within pad head holder additional foam pad , subject watch video . This arrangement snug uncomfortable . The subject ask hold button box one hand ; use make response provide performance data use validity check task engagement well correlation activation result . A `` panic ball '' also provide subject . The subject carefully orient equipment environment engage explicit practice task requirement . Anatomical Localizer High Resolution Imaging Acquisitions After subject position scanner , scanner shimmed provide homogeneous magnetic field image acquisition . An initial alignment scan do 3 orthogonal plane simultaneously use fast gradient echo sequence develop scanner . This scan take approximately 30 second provide quick view subject 's head position . Next , high-resolution T1-weighted 3-D neuroanatomic scan obtain use inversion recovery , fast spoiled gradient echo ( IR-prepped FSPGR ) protocol provide image morphometric study , localization MRS anatomical localization activation map . The acquisition take approximately 6 minute yield minimum spatial resolution 1mm x 1mm x 1.5mm sufficient signal noise ratio contrast gray white matter manual semi-automated segmentation regional brain volume . Proton MR Spectroscopy Acquisitions Proton MR spectroscopy data acquire use point resolve spectroscopy localization ( PRESS ) method . Graphically , 3D cubic volume element `` voxels '' position anatomic location base upon 3D image . Voxel 1 place anterior cingulate , voxel 2 leave dorsalateral prefrontal cortex , voxel 3 within basal ganglion encompass caudate , putamen internal capsule voxel 4 place along superior temporal gyrus . Voxel 5 use control position leave centrum semiovale , believe unaffected white matter region . Voxels 6 7 position within cerebellum vermis , respectively . Functional MRI Acquisitions The location 24 axial slice image fMRI procedure identify high resolution anatomical imaging sequence . These 24 slice , 5 millimeter thick ( 120 mm ) , sufficient cover area extend superiorly inferior aspect cerebellum apex cerebrum adult brain . Subjects undergo fMRI scan sequence ask perform task involve language , memory attention . The protocol fMRI scan T2 - weight gradient -echo Echo Planar Imaging ( EPI ) method . The time sequence alternate period ( 30 sec ) task condition repeat 5.5 time total 11 interval 10 acquisition per interval , result 240 image . 24 image slice acquire time point . Synchronization fMRI scan video stimulus fully automate visual presentation commences Macintosh computer , trigger Bruker MR scanner begin acquisition . The MacStim presentation fMRI scan timing synchronize trigger point end experiment . The high resolution MDEFT sequence allow 24 fMRI scan plane extract 3D anatomical data set interpolation use anatomical underlay activation map . Testing paradigm The Verb Generation task base describe Binder et al . involve auditory presentation series noun . The subject require generate verb associate noun . For example , noun `` ball '' present , subject might generate verb `` throw , '' `` kick , '' `` hit . '' The subject instruct think verb silently , without say , order minimize motion artifact associate speech . Task performance monitor button push time subject think verb . This expressive task assume require engagement dominant frontal lobe parietal lobe language area . This task derive clinical literature MRI analog procedure use Wada test . It widely use test hemispheric dominance language adult . It include current protocol partly provide point comparison exist literature well preliminary data population . Finally , difficult semantic task fit neatly scope language skill seek monitor lead expose young adult . For study design examine work memory , `` n-back '' task administer use MacStim software Macintosh PowerBook laptop computer . The `` n-back '' work memory task subject view number one four consistently appear one four quadrant screen . Subjects view stimuli audiovisual goggle system respond use button box button arrange correspond number appear screen . In `` zero back '' condition , subject press number corresponds number appear . In `` two back '' condition , subject press button correspond number appear two place prior number screen . During fMRI scan , subject ask perform `` zero two back '' task block-periodic design . During condition , 15 number appear 30 second interval . In , 11 interval present 5 1/2 minute scan . The `` zero-back '' task serve contrast `` two back '' task . Data first `` zero back '' task interval discard post-processing avoid non-equilibrium intensity modulation effect . In assess attention , CPT-IP administer use MacStim software MRI compatible audiovisual system . During fMRI scan subject ask perform CPT-IP task block-periodic design . Participants alternate two condition . During first condition , subject perform control task view four-digit number repeat constant rate ( 0.75 sec . ) instruct simply look flash number without respond way . During second condition , subject watch series high resolution four digit number appear random sequence instruct press response button see number repeat twice row sequence . Numbers appear every 0.75 sec .</detailed_description>
