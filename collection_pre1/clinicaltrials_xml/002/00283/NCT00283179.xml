	<brief_title>Aripiprazole Treatment Acutely Relapsed Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical treatment schizophrenia use antipsychotic drug , ameliorate acute episode probably prevent decrease risk occurrence new episode . Most antipsychotic share ability block postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor D2 subtype . The typical antipsychotic ( haloperidol chlorpromazine ) ameliorate acute episode possibly prevent decrease risk occurrence new episode , minimal effectiveness negative symptom , mood symptom , cognitive impairment , often lead poor social functioning . Its full Dopamine antagonism often associate number well-recognized debilitating side effect . One example EPS . A new class antipsychotic , atypical agent ( clozapine , risperidone , olanzapine ) , become available start late-1980s . Their mode action affect serotonin dopamine ( DA ) receptor . They well tolerate typical antipsychotic regard EPS , except high dos . The improvement side effect profile see atypical antipsychotic accompany efficacy positive symptom perhaps improvement efficacy negative symptom . Although offer well efficacy lower rate EPS compare typical agent , associate side effect may clinical concern . For example , olanzapine clozapine increase incidence weight gain diabetes mellitus , risperidone associate hyperprolactinemia , ziprasidone associate ECG QT interval prolongation . In addition tolerability issue , significant proportion patient still adequately respond new agent . A need still exist efficacious alternative demonstrate improve tolerability side effect profile enhance treatment compliance long-term functioning . Aripiprazole novel DA-serotonin stabilizer approve U.S. management schizophrenia . The unique mode action aripiprazole translate efficacy psychotic symptom favorable safety profile current treatment . Its introduction clearly provide patient family much-needed alternative antipsychotic currently available . This study examine efficacy safety aripiprazole patient acute relapse schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder Taiwan . The duration study 4 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis : Schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , acute relapse . Duration present episode/relapse : Randomization study occur four week follow day initiation treatment last episode/relapse . Age : 18 65 year . Gender : Males female ( female childbearing potential negative serum pregnancy test screen visit , use acceptable contraception , pregnant lactating ) . Response previous antipsychotic agent : Patients respond previous antipsychotic medication Current antipsychotic treatment : Prior begin placebowashout , patient treat longacting antipsychotic within time require one cycle treatment longacting antipsychotic , plus one week . Patients treat longacting antipsychotic within less time period might enrol study , provide judge investigator clearly clinically deteriorate . Positive Negative Syndrome Scale score : Patients total PANSS score least 60 . In addition , patient score least 4 two four PANSS item constitute psychotic item subscale . Compliance protocol : Patients rat reliably battery psychiatric movement rating scale require protocol . Informed Consent : Patients eligible enter study sign informed consent form prior initiation study procedure . Patients , opinion investigator , serious suicidal ideation patient liable serious suicide attempt , clinical judgment . Patients present first episode schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder Patients follow neurological diagnosis , whether treatment , whether stable : migraine , epilepsy , Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease , multiple sclerosis , residual stroke , transient cerebral ischemic attack , 'cerebral palsy ' condition require intermittent maintenance treatment , manifest abnormality neurological examination . Patients continue take , potentially need take , doubleblind portion study , follow concomitant medication , could cause unwanted drugtodrug interaction could confound analysis antipsychotic effectiveness randomly assign study drug : carbamazepine , valproic acid sodium valproate divalproate sodium , lithium carbonate lithium citrate . Patients fail withdraw fluoxetine treatment least 28 day prior screen , treatment fluoxetine . Patients gastrointestinal resection , stomach stapling , condition may impair absorption study medication . Patients positive result urine screen drug abuse ( except cannabis medicallyprescribed analgesic benzodiazepine . ) Patients meet DSMIV criterion psychoactive substance dependence patient history substance alcohol dependence within one month prior begin study . Patients somatic condition whose symptom physical sign could misinterpret sign symptom schizophrenia adverse effect antipsychotic medication . Patients acute unstable medical condition . Patients take investigational drug within four week , precede start placebo washout . Patients treatmentresistant . Patients continue take , potentially need take , study , medication substance know inhibitor microsomal enzyme CYP2D6 , inhibitor substrate microsomal enzyme CYP3A4 .</criteria>
