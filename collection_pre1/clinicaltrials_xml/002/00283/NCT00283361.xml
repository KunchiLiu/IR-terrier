	<criteria>1 . Male female patient , age 18 year 2 . A diagnosis acute subacute decompensated chronic heart failure , either ischemic nonischemic , require hospitalization , currently treat furosemide , torsemide , bumetadine , evidence base optimal treatment heart failure . Patients must clinical diagnosis CHF make least 3 month prior enrollment 3 . Ambulatory 4 . Objective sign LVD correspond LVEF &lt; 45 % , document accept method within previous 12 month . If documentation available within required time frame , LVEF must assess prior enrollment 5. ) Worsening heart failure symptom ( current NYHA class IIIIV ) . Patients must experience worsen least one symptom describe time entry study : Dyspnea Symptoms : Dyspnea ( labor difficult breathing ) rest Worsening dyspnea ( labor difficult breathing ) minimal exertion Worsening orthopnea ( difficult breathing except upright position ) Increased frequency nocturnal dyspnea ( awaken sleep due respiratory distress ) b ) Clinical evidence volume overload weight gain previous day , peripheral edema , hepatic congestion ascites , pulmonary congestion , pleural effusion 6 . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test enrollment . A female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal ( menses least 12 consecutive month ) without uterus and/or ovary 7 . Ability understand willing sign Informed Consent Form 1 . Incapable take 6minute walk test due condition unrelated heart failure , e.g. , muscular skeletal disability 2 . Valvular heart disease require surgical intervention ( course study . Patients heart failure due associate uncorrected primary valvular disease , malfunction artificial heart valve , uncorrected congenital heart disease ) 3 . History clinically significant evidence severe disease heart failure preclude participation complicate evaluation study result local laboratory : Hepatic disease ( AST , ALT , total bilirubin &gt; 3 time Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) , renal disease ( SCreatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL ) , Uncontrolled insulindependent diabetes mellitus history frequent hypoglycemic episode frequent hospitalization hyperglycemia , Cancer ( exclude treat nonmelanoma skin cancer ) 4 . Unstable angina , cardiogenic shock , acute pulmonary edema require follow : Nitroprusside , intravenous nitroglycerin , nesiritide , intravenous inotrope , need endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation 5 . Acute myocardial infarction and/or myocardial infarction within 30 day ( prior enrollment ) diagnose investigator ’ evaluation clinical symptom , ECG , and/or biochemical marker cardiac injury 6 . Cardiac arrest ( patient history cardiac arrest within 12 month unless precipitate event acute myocardial infarction , induction catheter placement , severe transient electrolyte abnormality , electrophysiology procedure , address Automatic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator placement . Patients increase risk cardiac arrest , QTc &gt; 450 msec , atrial ventricular block II III , etc . ) 7 . Sustainable VT/VF within 30 day ( &gt; 15 second long ; patient enrollment ECG show ventricular tachycardia premature ventricular complex associate symptom , ventricular tachycardia 6 beat ) 8 . Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation enrollment ECG ventricular rate &gt; 120 bpm 9 . Cardiac surgery within last month acutely require PCI ( patient undergone cardiac revascularization , valvular surgery , biventricular resynchronization procedure within 30 day . Patients ventricular reduction surgery cardiac myoplasty patient mechanical ventricular assist device ) 10 . Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg &gt; 200 mmHg 11 . Pulmonary embolism DVT history pulmonary embolism DVT within 6 month prior enrollment 12 . Severe obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease , patient primary pulmonary hypertension heart failure secondary pulmonary disease , severe pulmonary infection 13 . I.v . vasoactive treatment , e.g . vasodilator , positive inotropic agent , within 24 hour prior enrollment ( see detail Appendix E ) 14 . Participation another study evaluate experimental treatment within last 30 day potentially could bias outcome study 15 . Previous treatment ZP120 16 . Patients know abuse actively abuse alcohol illicit drug . Abuse alcohol define usual daily intake 100 gram ethanol per day , approximately six 12ounce bottle beer , one 750 mL bottle wine , 250 mL 80 proof spirit 17 . Inability unwillingness provide inform consent 18 . BMI outside range 2050 kg/m2 ( BMI equal 20 50 kg/m2 accept ) 19 . Any condition therapy , opinion Principal Investigator would make patient unsuitable study</criteria>
