	<brief_summary>This study determine stimulation stroke-injured side brain combined stimulation paralyze hand temporarily improve sense touch stroke patient . Healthy normal volunteer people single stroke within 3 month enter study affect one side brain may eligible study . All participant must 18 90 year old must right-handed . Candidates screen medical history , neurological examination magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain one do within 1 year enter study . Participants undergo follow test procedure four 2-day session 6 week : - Peripheral high-frequency stimulation : Small loudspeaker tap fingertip simple tactile pulse pass skin . Stimulation may sham real . - Transcranial direct current stimulation : Two small rubber electrode tap head - one eye back head . A current pass two electrode . Stimulation may sham real . - MRI : The subject lie scanner , metal cylinder surround magnetic field , 40 minute , lie still 40 minute time . An electrical stimulation apply finger right leave hand separate session . Earplugs worn muffle loud noise scan . Functional MRI measure blood flow change brain performance specific task . - Behavioral measurement : - Grating orientation task : The subject responds quickly possible touch stimulus finger say whether direction stimulus vertical horizontal . - Haptic object recognition task : The subject give five category unfamiliar object shape cube . During task , identical object hide sack . With eye close , subject ask identify find object sack quickly possible . - Pegboard test : The subject ask place several peg correspond hole pegboard soon possible . - Tapping task : The subject ask tap metal stick metal plate quickly possible 1 minute . - Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation : This test measure change brain activity . A wire coil hold scalp brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The subject hears click may fee pull sensation skin coil , may twitch muscle face , arm leg . Subjects may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . - Paired-pulse somatosensory evoke potential mapping : This test measure brain activity another brain area . The subject seat chair eye close . One electrode place eye two others place back head . A short electrical stimulus apply nerve wrist brain activity record stimulus apply . - Surface electromyography : This test measure electrical activity muscle . Electrodes file conductive gel tap skin . - Visual analog mood scale : Subjects complete questionnaire attention , fatigue mood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tactile Learning Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic stroke often accompany tactile impairment contribute long-term disability activity daily live . While new rehabilitative intervention recently become available motor domain use transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , generally accept treatment tactile impairment chronic stroke . Previous study healthy volunteer demonstrate tactile acuity haptic skill improve apply passive learning protocol fingertip ( peripheral high-frequency stimulation , pHFS ) . Based finding , purpose protocol enhance beneficial effect pHFS implicit tactile haptic learn chronic stroke patient combine application pHFS tDCS ( pHFS+tDCS ) apply somatosensory cortex affect hemisphere . This approach might identify novel strategy enhance functional recovery stroke might provide deep insight mechanistic information neural substrate involve behavioral gain . Primary outcome measure performance tactile grate orientation discrimination task ( GOT ) haptic object recognition task . In order obtain descriptive preliminary information relation sensory improvement motor deficit chronic stroke patient , secondary outcome measure fine motor task tap task pegboard test ( PBT ) require manual dexterity , handeye coordination , steadiness , perceptual motor skill . To identify operate mechanism underlie hypothesized performance improvement pHFS+tDCS , use paired-pulse protocol evaluate change cortical excitability well fMRI subset patient identify cortical map reorganization primary ( SI ) secondary ( SII ) somatosensory cortex well primary motor cortex ( MI ) . Healthy volunteer test ( ) since data available performance haptic task healthy subject , ( b ) obtain descriptive information influence intervention task hypothesis generation purpose future investigation , ( c ) sensorimotor performance non-paretic hand stroke patient often normal therefore poor sole control performance paretic hand . Studies chronic stroke patient help address main experimental hypothesis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We include leave righthanded stroke patient , age 1890 year , thromboembolic hemorrhagic hemispheric lesion least 3 month stroke . We choose patient initially severe motor paresis ( MRC grade 2 ) , subsequently recover point residual motor deficit perform require task . Moreover , chronic stroke patient moderate tactile deficit ( define absolute touch threshold 4 N use von Frey filament ) able differentiate alignment grate dome ( either orthogonal parallel index finger ) least 5 mm groove apply fingertip include protocol . Assessment initial functional state take either patient report medical record . Righthanded healthy volunteer , age 1890 year , able concentrate require task . Handedness assess Edinburgh inventory scale well hand dominance test ( HDT ) . We additionally perform pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . All experimental session outpatient basis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Chronic stroke patient eligible study : unable perform behavioral task , sensory neglect , one clinical stroke , side brain affect , stroke cerebellum brainstem , history alcohol drug abuse severe language disturbance serious cognitive deficit , uncontrolled medical problem , heart , lung kidney disease , epilepsy diabetes mellitus , severe tactile deficit ( define Frey filament exert force 4 N distal pad finger paretic nonparetic hand ) , pregnant , cardiac pacemaker , intracardiac line , implant medication pump , neural stimulators , metal cranium , exception dental brace mouth . Exclusion criterion healthy volunteer : Healthy volunteer eligible study : unable perform task , history alcohol drug abuse severe language disturbance serious cognitive deficit , uncontrolled medical problem , heart , lung kidney disease , epilepsy diabetes mellitus , severe tactile deficit ( define Frey filament exert force 4 N distal pad finger ) , pregnant , cardiac pacemaker , intracardiac line , implant medication pump , neural stimulators , metal cranium except mouth , dental brace .</criteria>
