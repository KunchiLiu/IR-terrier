	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety activity type vaccine immune therapy prostate cancer . This vaccine make participant 's immune cell ( call dendritic cell ) obtain blood donation . Dendritic cell immune cell , whose role identify foreign antigen ( bacteria , virus , tumor cell , example ) body activate cell immune system mount attack foreign antigen . Each participant randomize either Arm 1 ( experimental treatment ) Arm 2 ( placebo first , experimental treatment ) . Participants give vaccine three booster injection . After placebo phase , participant Arm 2 crossover treatment phase participant eventually receive experimental treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Vaccine Prostate Cancer That Uses Each Patients ' Own Immune Cells .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II dendritic cell vaccine study patient prostate cancer . Our laboratory demonstrate effective tumor immunity human associate , likely mediate least part tumor antigen-specific killer T cell ( Albert et al. , 1998a ; Darnell , 1999 ; Darnell Posner , 2003 ) . Moreover , demonstrate apoptotic material derive die tumor cell potent mean deliver antigen DCs subsequently trigger tumor antigen-specific T cell response ex vivo ( Albert et al. , 1998a ; Albert et al. , 1998c ) . In study , patient 3 consecutive rise PSA measure least 2 week apart , definite local therapy ( prostatectomy radiation ) recruit . Peripheral blood monocyte collect leukapheresis dendritic cell generate Cleanroom Laboratory Molecular Neuro-Oncology . These dendritic cell pulse apoptotic prostate cancer cell cell line ( LNCaP ) , harvest , test certain release criterion , inject vaccine . When patient find eligible study , randomize either experimental group placebo group purpose compare adverse event group . Vaccine plus 3 booster ( placebo ) give , two week apart . After third booster , patient unblinded . Those receive vaccine enter follow phase include post treatment leukapheresis . Those placebo group cross receive vaccine booster . The primary outcome evaluate toxicity activity . Patients evaluate local systemic toxicity . For activity , measure immunological clinical response vaccine , compare measure take vaccination , combine patient arm .</detailed_description>
