	<brief_summary>This study evaluate immunogenicity consistency 3 Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine lot safety immunogenicity Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine compare control group receive license Hib conjugate vaccine , co-administered Pediarix® healthy infant 2 , 4 , 6 month age . The study also evaluate safety immunogenicity Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine compare control group receive license Hib conjugate vaccine , co-administered M-M-R® II Varivax® 12 15 month age .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Study Hib-MenCY-TT Vaccine Compared Licensed Hib Conjugate Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subject study participate one three cohort : - US Safety Immunogenicity ( Cohort 1 ) : All immunogenicity analyse primary booster phase evaluate cohort . These subject also contribute safety analysis primary booster phase . - Safety Only ( Cohort 2 ) : Only safety objective assess primary booster phase cohort . - Non-US Safety Immunogenicity ( Cohort 3 ) : Only descriptive immunogenicity result primary booster phase report cohort . These subject also contribute safety analysis primary booster phase . Treatment allocation : Primary phase : Subjects randomize balanced allocation ( 1:1:1:1 ) 1 4 treatment group stratification accord cohort . Assignment cohort base study site . Booster phase : Subjects receive Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine primary phase receive booster dose Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine . Subjects receive ActHIB primary phase receive booster dose PedvaxHIB . During 3-dose primary vaccination course , co-administration Prevnar , Synagis , and/or rotavirus vaccine permit ; co-administration influenza vaccine permit dose 3 . During booster vaccination , co-administration Prevnar , hepatitis A vaccine influenza vaccine permit subject Cohort 1 , 2 3 ; co-administration measles , mumps , rubella varicella vaccine permit subject Cohort 2 3 . The study conduct double-blind fashion regard consistency 3 manufacturing lot Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine single-blind fashion Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine versus monovalent Hib vaccine . The parents/guardians blind collection data pertain period one month booster vaccination . Therefore , extend safety follow-up booster dose conduct unblinded manner . The person administer vaccine ensure parent/guardian see vaccine vial use reconstitute vaccine . Due difference presentation candidate Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine control vaccine , possible blind study personnel administer vaccine .</detailed_description>
