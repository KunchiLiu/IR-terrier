	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize skeletal deficit risk factor impair skeletal development child require glucocorticoid therapy . We compare bone health child treat prednisone nephrotic syndrome ( NS treat prednisone Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) . Childhood NS usually respond prednisone characterized pathology impact bone . In contrast , CD treat prednisone , independently associate poor growth maturation , nutritional deficiency inflammation . Due difference disease , comparison allow u distinguish prednisone-related disease-related effect bone two disease state .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prednisone , glucocorticoid medication , widely use many pediatric disorder . Studies show drug decrease bone formation , decrease bone density bone thickness child . Prednisone induce osteopenia , low bone density , worsen effect underlie disease , delayed growth maturation , malnutrition , increase bone resorption ( removal ) inflammatory compound . The combined effect decrease bone formation increase resorption may particularly detrimental grow skeleton . Subjects include 15 newly diagnose NS patient , 60 patient pre-existing NS , 90 patient newly diagnose CD , 45 patient diagnose within last two year 200 healthy control similar age , gender ethnicity . Participants visit Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) three time 12-month period assessment bone mineralization turnover , fracture history , dietary calcium intake , physical activity , growth , body composition , muscle strength glucocorticoid exposure .</detailed_description>
