	<brief_summary>Veterans complete GEMS-Phase 1 ask participate GEMS-Phase 2 determine accuracy method use assess mild memory problem . This good help u evaluate screen test complete GEMS-Phase 1 . The goal : 1 . Compare assessment memory make initial visit assessment memory make second evaluation . 2 . Determine veteran mild memory problem improvement worsen memory problem time . Our long-term goal remain optimize quality care veteran cognitive impairment . We also determine patient characteristic use target case-finding , describe current process care evaluate association cognitive impairment overall- dementia-related health care utilization cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Patients With Dementia Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dementia high public health significance due prevalence , adverse impact patient caregiver , high economic cost society rapidly expand number individual age 65 old . As large provider geriatric care U.S. , dementia particularly relevant Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) . However , small proportion patient dementia diagnose early treatment effective opportunity careful life planning remain , part absence feasible , well-validated case-finding instrument . Our long-term objective improve care outcome veteran clinically significant cognitive impairment . The first step towards realize objective determine acceptability cognitive screening patient identify feasible , valid case-finding tool primary care . We also determine patient characteristic use target case-finding , describe current process care evaluate association cognitive impairment overall- dementia-related health care utilization cost . Our research team , locate Center Health Services Research Primary Care , bring together researcher uniquely suit achieve objective . Specific Aims1.Primary Aim : To determine cognitive screen acceptable patient , whether brief cognitive screener perform well longer Modified Mini-Mental Status Exam ( 3MS ) dementia cognitive impairment-not dementia ( CIND ) .Primary Hypothesis 1 : Higher perceive risk dementia , high perceive benefit few perceive harm screen positively associate screen acceptance . Primary Hypotheses 2 : Compared 3MS , Mini-Cog , Memory Impairment Screen 2-item functional screen similar performance characteristic . 2.Secondary Aim 1 : To determine sociodemographic clinical characteristic available electronic medical record use target individual cognitive screen improve screen accuracy . Hypothesis : The combination sociodemographic characteristics/clinical information screen result accurately discriminate demented non-demented patient screen result alone.3.Secondary Aim 2 : To describe current care inception cohort dementia cognitive impairment-not dementia . Hypothesis : Compared patient dementia , patient cognitive impairment-not dementia undergo less diagnostic testing , less likely complete advance directive less likely receive dementia specific medication . 4.Exploratory Aim : To evaluate association cognitive impairment overall- dementia-related health care utilization cost . Exploratory Hypothesis : Controlling sociodemographic characteristic medical comorbidity , overall healthcare utilization cost increase cognitive impairment increase . In phase 1 , random sample primary care patient age 65 year recruit 3 primary care clinic complete Modified Dementia Screening Acceptance Perceived Harms Questionnaire . In phase 2 , patient complete three brief instrument standard 15-item 3MS compare criterion standard interview dementia . We project 140-200 patient dementia , 200-300 CIND , approximately 600 cognitively normal . Instruments compare use sensitivity/specificity , likelihood ratio receiver operate characteristic curve . The emotional impact screen assess follow screening . Clinical sociodemographic characteristic available Computerized Patient Record System , together cognitive screening result , analyzed logistic regression model identify risk factor may use target individual cognitive screening and/or improve screen accuracy . Care pattern patient dementia CIND describe base detailed chart abstraction . For exploratory analysis cognitive impairment utilization , two-part utilization model estimate utilization type , outpatient clinic visit , inpatient visit , pharmacy utilization , utilization type ; utilization data obtain administrative data .</detailed_description>
