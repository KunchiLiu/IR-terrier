	<brief_title>Risperidone Augmentation Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims - We propose double-blind , placebo-controlled trial study effectiveness tolerability add risperidone stable yet partially remitted patient schizophrenia maintain clozapine . We anticipate enrol total 40 subject period two year Freedom Trail Clinic affiliate site Boston , Massachusetts . Our primary outcome measure change total score Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) . Secondary hypothesis ( 1 ) clozapine-risperidone combination well tolerate , ( 2 ) clozapine level influence risperidone , ( 3 ) prolactin elevation suitable surrogate marker sufficient D2 blockade predict response . Background - Despite new generation antipsychotic , many patient schizophrenia achieve partial syndromal remission . In effort improve symptomatic functional outcome , become common practice combine antipsychotic medication . Since strategy largely unproven expensive , empirical trial urgently need . Our group find open trial add risperidone clozapine well tolerate lead improvement psychopathology . Additional support increase D2 blockade clozapine partial responder come form two small study use sulpiride pimozide . We hypothesize subgroup patient might benefit additional D2 blockade beyond clozapine alone accomplish . Methods - The propose trial placebo-controlled , randomize , double-blind , last 8 week . We expect enroll 40 subject overall . Subjects eligible diagnose schizophrenia treat clozapine . In addition , must residual symptom schizophrenia interested improvement residual psychopathology . Subjects dementia mental retardation well pregnant woman exclude . After 2-week placebo lead-in period assure stable psychopathology minimize placebo-response , subject randomly allocate receive 6 week either risperidone ( 20 subject ) , match placebo ( 20 subject ) add onto customary antipsychotic medication , clozapine . Overall , 5 study visit every 2 week plus initial screening visit . On visit , subject evaluate standard psychiatric rating scale psychopathology side effect . In addition , measure serum level medication use , clozapine risperidone . Fasting glucose measure screening , week 4 , week 8 visit . This do monitor subject worsen glucose control . This possible concern due association atypical antipsychotic , include risperidone , hyperglycemia . Subjects discover either diabetes develop diabetes study , worsen glucose control diabetic , discontinue referred PCP work-up treatment . This additional blood test lead additional blood draw simply add subject 's routine mandate biweekly WBC monitoring . The study endpoint 20 % improvement primary rating scale psychopathology , Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) . No worsen psychopathology expect trial subject maintain primary antipsychotic , clozapine . Benefits - There definite benefit participate trial . Subjects receive thorough psychiatric evaluation , review pharmacologic treatment , physical exam baseline laboratory study . The result initial evaluation communicate treat psychiatrist . Subjects receive nominal fee $ 20 per study visit ( 5 study visit schedule overall ) . The propose study direct clinical application , theoretical interest . Few data available controlled trial guide clinicians patient remain symptomatic clozapine . From conceptual standpoint , study clarify value additional D2 blockade treatment response . Risks Discomforts - Risperidone approve FDA treatment schizophrenia . The dose 4 mg low end dose recommendation usually well tolerate . Possible side effect sedation , extrapyramidal symptom , akathisia , hyperprolactinemia , orthostatic hypotension . Tardive dyskinesia long-term side effect would expect 6-week trial . However , exist tardive dyskinesia could worsen . Blood draw entails transient discomfort , might lead hematoma site . Being interviewed clinical symptom help rating scale tire upsetting sensitive psychological experience discuss . There also association atypical antipsychotic , include risperidone , hyperglycemia , require monitoring blood sugar treatment . No inpatient hospital time require . Minimization Risks - To minimize discomfort blood draw , study blood work add onto mandatory blood draw subject undergo receive clozapine . Vital sign monitor baseline every two week . Side effect monitor baseline every two week . The Systematic Assessment Treatment Emergent Events ( SAFTEE ) primary instrument use detect side effect . The SAFTEE use tabulate side effect yearly IRB summary . Serious adverse event , well adverse event , review PI report IRB accord institutional policy . The PIs group meet weekly review study protocol study event . Fasting glucose measure screening , week 4 , week 8 visit . This do monitor subject worsen glucose control . This possible concern due association atypical antipsychotic , include risperidone , hyperglycemia . Subjects discover either diabetes develop diabetes study worsen glucose control ( poor glucose control judge new-onset diabetes new-onset glucose intolerance . ) discontinue referred primary care physician ( PCP ) work-up treatment . In patient establish diabetes , six week active treatment long enough meaningfully judge diabetes control difficult usual ( typical parameter glucose control hemoglobin A1C reflection long-term glucose control , i.e . several month ) . We follow patient clinically cooperation PCP decide patient stay trial . This additional blood test lead additional blood draw simply add subject 's routine mandate biweekly white blood cell count monitoring . Patients withdraw study become suicidal deteriorate psychiatrically . This assess every 2 week use PANSS Calgary Depression Scale Schizophrenia ( CDSS ) : clinical deterioration define 20 % increase total PANSS score , suicidality define rating `` mild '' ( frequent thought well dead , occasional think suicide ) CDSS . Subjects worsen symptom tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) discontinue referred psychiatrist work-up treatment ( Worsening TD judge 20 % increase Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) ) .</detailed_description>
