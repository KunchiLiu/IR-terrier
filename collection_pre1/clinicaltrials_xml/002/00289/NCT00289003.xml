	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore protective effect safety soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan compare placebo oral mucositis head neck patient receive radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy . Hypothesis : Soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan immunomodulating activity prevent oral mucositis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Protective Effect Soluble Beta-1,3/1,6-Glucan Compared Placebo Oral Mucositis Head Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral mucositis define inflammation ulceration mucous membrane mouth . The condition painful might put patient risk serious systemic infection common dose-limiting toxicity chemotherapy radiotherapy . The present treatment mucositis primarily supportive ; strong analgesic addition oral hygiene . Prophylactic antibiotic use many topical agent available palliate mucositis , standard therapy accept . Comparison : Methyl cellulose choose placebo due close resemblance soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan term general appearance viscosity . Methyl cellulose viscous solution might form mucosal barrier . Physical barrier consider protective function oral mucositis , methyl cellulose might consider active control .</detailed_description>
