	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Chromium Picolinate + Biotin Glucose Cholesterol Control T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There Initial Pre-Screening Contact , two office visit ( Baseline Final ) , two mid-study phone contact subject course study . Volunteers take either chromium picolinate ( 600 μg Cr ) + biotin ( 2 mg ) ( n=400 ) placebo ( n=200 ) daily prior morning meal 90 day . Assessments glycosylated hemoglobin , lipid profile , quality life take Baseline Visit . After 90 day another set assessments take Final Visit comparison baseline value . All subject go brief physical exam , medical history assessment , comprehensive concomitant medication assessment well provide blood urine sample baseline final visit ensure subject safety maintain . The subject contact , central call center , visit Day 30 Day 60 ensure study compliance remind subject take dos study product , perform daily blood glucose monitoring , complete study diary daily .</detailed_description>
