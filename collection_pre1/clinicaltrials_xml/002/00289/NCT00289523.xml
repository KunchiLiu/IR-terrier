	<brief_title>EEG Biomarkers Predicting Response Antidepressant Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According recent clinical study sponsor NIH , few half subject diagnose major depressive episode respond first trial antidepressant medication . While majority subject eventually respond treatment antidepressant , failure first line medication put subject increase risk never receive adequate treatment depression . Several line reason support rationale investigate EEG mean predict response resistance antidepressant . Prior study suggest change neuronal activity anterior cingulate prefrontal region relate depression change brain response treatment may also produce alteration detect recode frontal EEG activity . In protocol , propose identify possible neurophysiologic indicator treatment outcome depression , particularly indicator brain response appear early ( within 7 day ) treatment antidepressant . We test whether quantitative EEG ( QEEG ) biomarkers reliably associate response non-response treatment antidepressant medication , use monotherapy combination drug treatment . Comparison ( ) : Selecting best treatment subject resistance initial antidepressant pose considerable challenge clinician . The widely prescribed antidepressant usually require 4-6 week therapeutic dosing mark clinical improvement symptom observe . Therefore , determine optimal regimen take several week month subject resistant first line antidepressant . A tool predict eventual clinical response antidepressant could help inform accelerate process identify efficacious treatment option give subject .</detailed_description>
