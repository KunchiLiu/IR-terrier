	<brief_title>Aquatic Exercise Efficacy Enhancement Decrease Fall Risk Older Adults With Hip Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older adult hip osteoarthritis ( OA ) often experience pain loss mobility significantly impair ability walk , climb stair , shop participate exercise program . This result social isolation , depression loss confidence ability manage independently community . A decline physical psycho-social function lead increase risk fall . It crucial identify high-risk faller well best intervention decrease risk ; hip fracture fall devastate , result death admission long-term care majority sustain . Exercise program design improve balance , strength mobility help improve function decrease risk fall . However , individual hip OA may difficulty participate program due pain . Aquatic exercise offer activity alternative improve mobility , strength decrease fall risk . As well , addition group program design enhance confidence movement may reduce risk fall improve independence active home community . This project evaluate effect aquatic exercise aquatic exercise combine group educational program decrease fall risk old adult hip OA . Determining optimal fall prevention program may avert death loss quality life old adult , clearly important contribution preventative health care .</detailed_description>
