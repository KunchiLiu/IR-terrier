	<detailed_description>SIGNIFICANCE &amp; RATIONALE FOR PROPOSED PROJECT Foot problem common complication diabetic lead hospitalization.1-5 Approximately one quarter hospital day person diabetes related foot complications.4,5,8 In United States approximately 120,000 non-traumatic low extremity amputation perform year.6,7 In U.S. , 45 % -83 % low extremity amputation involve diabetics.1,9,5 Overall , patient diabetes 15-46 time likely amputation patient without diabetes.11,14,15 It estimate 5 % 15 % diabetic low extremity amputation lifetime.11 After initial amputation 9-17 % diabetic patient experience second amputation within year12-17 25 % 68 % diabetic amputation contralateral extremity within five years.18-20 The five-year survival rate lower extremity amputation range 41 % 70 % .19-21 Indeed , 10 % patient die leave hospital low extremity amputation.7,9,20 National Initiatives : There number initiatives federal state government organization prioritize effort reduce burden diabetes related amputation . Healthy People 2000 Healthy People 2010 set goal reduce incidence diabetes related amputation 40 % , U.S. Department Health Human Services prioritize amputation reduction minorities one strategic Initiatives Eliminate Racial Ethnic Disparities Health . Likewise , Veterans Administration Indian Health Service prioritize amputation prevention patient diabetes . For instance , VA mandate development special program evaluate patient diabetes , identify patient fit high-risk profile , provide specialize treatment program order decrease impact diabetes related complication within Veterans Health Administration . Lower extremity complication diabetic common , costly associate high rate recurrence , morbidity mortality . Several study U.S. Europe suggest amputation ulceration prevent special foot care education implement . Despite type initiative , increase research knowledge , good re-vascularization diagnostic procedure expand armamentarium new drug technology , incidence amputation increase past decades.15 Precursors amputation : In diabetes , chronic disease , patient involvement identify early warning sign disease process imperative reduce incidence complication prevent morbidity . Many low extremity complication involve sensory neuropathy pivotal component critical pathway development ulcer amputation . Therefore , pain loss function , primary natural warn system alert u take action seek medical care , faulty . Diabetic patient hence sustain injury recognize severe full thickness ulceration result . The aim study evaluate tool help high-risk diabetic identify area foot inflame prone ulceration wound develop site would otherwise recognize “ symptomatic. ” Results Phase I study indicated high-risk patient diabetes effectively use infrared temperature device monitor foot temperature . Patients used device significantly few foot complication compare patient receive education , therapeutic shoe plus insole regular foot evaluation alone . Foot ulcer one common precursor diabetes related amputations.8,25 Other factor associate amputation , infection , faulty wound healing , ischemia , usually cause tissue loss amputation absence wound . Therefore , ulcer prevention one focus amputation prevention program . Three primary pathway mechanisms injury recently identify development foot ulcer They include wound result ill-fitting shoe ( low-pressure injury associate prolonged constant pressure narrow short shoe ) , repetitive moderate force sole foot , puncture wound ( high-pressure injury single exposure direct pressure ) . The common mechanism involve second scenario ( receptive moderate force ) . Except puncture wound , area likely ulcerate associate increase local skin temperature due inflammation enzymatic autolysis tissue . Several report suggest wound develop due cumulative effect unrecognized repetitive injury course several day . Identifying area injury presence inflammation would allow patient health care provider take action decrease inflammation wound develops . Effectiveness prevention : Several study suggest foot complication prevent focused team approach identify treat low extremity complication . This approach generally involve de-weighting pressure area special shoe , patient education self-care practice , re-vascularization , optimal glucose control , infection control , use appropriate referral pattern , regular foot care.18 , 26-30 Several study demonstrate significant decrease incidence ulceration re-ulceration therapeutic footwear , education , regular diabetic foot care provide . However , 19-28 % patient still re-ulcerated within 12-18 months.26,31,32 Edmonds coworkers18 report 26 % re-ulceration rate high-risk diabetic special shoe insole compare 83 % re-ulceration rate patient wear shoe . Likewise Uccioli26 report 28 % re-ulceration rate diabetic treat custom shoe insole compare 50 % re-ulceration among patient without special footwear . In descriptive report , Helm co-workers32 report 19 % re-ulceration 18-month period among patient heal neuropathic ulcer total contact cast . As study , wound closure patient receive custom shoe heal sandal regular clinical follow-up care . All study perform specialty foot center focus diabetes . Even center , risk re-injury high . Predicting impending injury : Our rationale evaluate skin temperature involve search quantifiable , reproducible measurement inflammation use identify pathologic process result ulcer . Inflammation one early sign foot ulceration . Five cardinal sign characterize inflammation : redness , pain , swell , loss function heat . Many sign difficult assess objectively . In neuropathic extremity , pain disturbance function may absent neuropathy thus poor indicator inflammation . In addition , swell redness difficult objectively grade clinician clinician visit visit . Most lay people able understand accurately evaluate subtle parameter . However , temperature measurement easily perform patient spouse provide quantitative information show predictive impend ulceration diabetic sensory neuropathy . Since ulcer develop result cumulative injury course several day , patient need mechanism identify early warning sign ulceration prompt take appropriate action.44 The high re-ulceration rate report previous study indicate early warning sign miss . A home temperature monitoring system wound prevention similar concept home glucose monitoring help patient adjust insulin . In case patient need frequent information health parameter potential change short period time . In case patient taught use objective data provide home monitoring device alter behavior whether used change insulin dosage activity level . One barrier lower incidence ulcer amputation objective mechanism patient use home , home monitoring system . In past , standard patient education focus teach patient self-inspection skill patient could adequately perform use hand mirror visual inspection . In study ulcer risk factor , large proportion patient without foot ulcer visual acuity , manual dexterity , joint flexibility perform simple self-examination check foot . Among ulcer patient 49 % could position and/or visualize foot , 15 % ulcer patient legally blind least one eye . Even family member available visually inspect foot , without objective measure injury , layman able identify ulcer occurred.33 State exist knowledge : Over last three decade , several author suggest skin temperature monitoring may valuable tool detect “ risk ” sit patient insensate.34-41 As early 1971 Goller34 report association increase local temperature localize pressure lead tissue injury . Sandrow coworkers35 subsequently use thermometry tool diagnosis occult neuropathic fracture patient diabetes 1972 . Stess et al.37 Clark et al.40 describe use infrared thermography ass skin temperature diabetic , diabetic neuropathic fracture , diabetic ulcer , patient leprosy , control . They find neuropathic foot ulcer frequently increase skin temperature surround central necrotic area suggest infrared thermometry may useful technique identify patient risk ulceration.40 Benbow coworkers38 take work step evaluate foot temperature tool identify diabetic risk foot ulceration . They suggest thermographic pattern could use screen high-risk patients.38 They prospectively evaluate 50 patient diabetes sensory neuropathy 3 4 year . Six patient develop neuropathic ulcer study period . These patient significantly high foot temperature baseline patient ulcerate . All early study use liquid crystal contact thermography map temperature pattern sole foot . The device use study bulky , expensive difficult use integrate normal clinical setting . In study High-Risk Diabetic Foot Clinic University Texas27 San Antonio , hypothesize local skin temperature affect limb would higher extremity pathology ( neuropathic ulcer , acute Charcot ’ arthropathy ) patient without pathology compare corresponding site contralateral foot . Further , expect temperature return normal ulcer fracture heal complete . Lastly , question whether dermal thermometry could potentially predictive neuropathic ulceration . To end , 143 consecutive patient diabetes presented treatment High-Risk Diabetic Foot Clinic enrol . All evaluate thermometry . These patient divide 3 group : 78 patient asymptomatic loss protective threshold , 44 neuropathic foot ulceration , 21 patient neuropathic ( Charcot ) fracture . Temperatures evaluate portable handheld infrared skin temperature probe ( Dermatemp 1001 , Exergen Products , Watertown , MA , USA ) . Patients ’ skin temperature measure time pathology initially identify subsequent clinical follow-up visit average 22.1 ± 6.4 month . Temperatures contralateral foot measure control . In population , significant difference skin temperature Charcot ( 8.30°F , p &lt; 0.001 ) ulcer group ( 5.60°F , p &lt; 0.001 ) compare region overlie site pathology contralateral side . No significant temperature difference identify group asymptomatic loss protective threshold group acute pathology . Temperatures normalized time Charcot quiescence ulcer heal . Eleven percent patient ulcer group re-ulcerated mean 12.2 ± 6.4 month initial heal correspond significant increase skin temperature clinic visit immediately precede reinjury ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . These data suggest monitor correspond contralateral foot site may provide objective , clinical information clinical sign injury identify infrared dermal thermometry may predictive neuropathic ulceration.27 Subsequent study indicate elevated skin temperature directly correlate location acute neuropathic osteoarthropathy ( Charcot ’ arthropathy ) temperatures equilibrate predictable manner acute Charcot ’ arthropathy resolve quiescent state.28,29 Furthermore , difference temperature wound side compare corresponding contralateral site decrease surface area wound decreases.30 As practical measure , opposite extremity use previous study control expose duration control diabetes systemic complication affect limb represent built-in comparison source . In manner , patient serf control . Because disease process neuropathic fracture ulceration involve multiple factor affect low extremity perfusion temperature regulation , would difficult identify absolute skin temperature level could consider normal one could use universal reference . For instance , baseline temperature patient Charcot ’ fracture may higher diabetic patient without complication person without diabetes.45-47 In related study , temperature assess manual palpation identify relatively inaccurate mean quantify skin temperature.47 To end , eleven healthy physician , eight male mean age 28.6 ± 4.4 year , enrol study . These subject instruct palpate two five steel cylinder know temperature use volar surface hand . The five cylinder , arrange randomly carefully gradate produce equal , 2 , 4 6 degree Celsius temperature gradient . They ask whether temperature difference two cylinder equal , 2º , 4º 6° Celsius . This process repeat total ten time participant . Subjects correctly estimate temperature gradient mean 1.00 ± 0.89 time 10 random attempt . There significant difference temperature gradient frequency correct answer ( p &gt; 0.05 ) . It conclude , lay hand clinical set necessary crucial component doctor-patient relationship , manual palpation , even control environment , reliable objective mean assess temperature . For TempTouch IR Thermometry high-risk diabetic patient self care study STUDY SPECIFIC AIMS : 1 . To evaluate effectiveness home infrared temperature probe reduce incidence diabetic foot ulcer among high-risk patient ; 2 . To evaluate cost home temperature monitoring compare standard therapy among high-risk patient diabetes ; 3 .
