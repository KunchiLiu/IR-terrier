	<brief_title>C1 Esterase Inhibitor ( C1INH-nf ) Treatment Acute Hereditary Angioedema ( HAE ) Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized subject treat qualify attack eligible receive rescue dose 1,000 U C1INH-nf achieve begin substantial relief define symptom within 4 hour initial treatment blind study drug , time attack progress include airway compromise . A second 1,000 U rescue dose permit 60 minute initial rescue dose , necessary . The study design also allow administration open-label C1INH-nf laryngeal angioedema attack , non-randomizable event due presence potential airway compromise ( immediate 1,000 U dose C1INH-nf , repeat 60 minute , necessary ) . In addition , subject eligible receive open-label C1INH-nf ( 1,000 U single dose ) prior emergency surgical ( non-cosmetic ) procedure . A total 83 subject enrol study . Seventy-one ( 71 ) subject experience qualify attack randomize blind study drug ( 36 C1INH-nf , 35 placebo ) ; 71 randomized subject analyze efficacy . An additional 12 subject never randomize receive open-label C1INH-nf treatment laryngeal angioedema and/or prior emergency surgical procedure . Of 35 subject randomize placebo , 23 also receive C1INH-nf ( eg , rescue , open-label ) . In total , 83 subject receive least 1 dose study drug analyze safety ; 71 subject expose C1INH-nf ( 59 randomize , 12 open-label ) 12 subject expose placebo .</detailed_description>
