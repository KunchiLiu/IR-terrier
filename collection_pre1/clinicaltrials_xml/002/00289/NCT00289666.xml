	<brief_title>The Effect Positive Airway Pressure Heart Rate Variability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Visit 1 : You come Diabetes Metabolic Research Center refrain take routine medication eat last 8 hour , avoid use caffeine-containing beverage tobacco product last 10 hour , alcoholic beverage last 24 hour . In addition , refrain take nonprescription drug avoid engage vigorous exercise 48 hour test . For individual diabetes , letter direct verbal permission obtain , prior come study visit , eye doctor indicate take part one test list . During visit , electrocardiogram ( EKG , usual heart rhythm test perform doctor 's office ) perform . Your heart rate also measure six minute EKG machine breathe deeply possible . This test , perform twice , tell whether nerve go heart normal . You ask blow plastic tube 15 second ( test obtain eye doctor 's permission individual diabetes ) . Your heart rate measure 60 second finish blow . This test , perform twice , tell nerve go blood vessel normal . Your blood pressure measure four time , one minute apart , lie . You ask stand blood pressure measure four time , time one minute apart . Change heart rate also determine go lie stand . All individual fingerstick blood sugar level perform prior performance test describe . You 2 tablespoon blood drawn . This blood store ( frozen ) case possible risk factor reduce heart rate variability discover future . A random urine sample store ( frozen ) potential examination microalbuminuria ( protein urine ) possible risk factor . At visit , give container instruction collect urine 24-hours . You also give dietary suggestion ( e.g. , eat liberal salt diet ) would like follow 3-days prior 24-hour collection urine . For individual diabetes , small portion blood check determine blood sugar control level . Standard medical history question ask visit along question assess likelihood fall asleep various situation . Your medical record pulmonary doctor review information result sleep study determine sleep disorder . You ask keep diary everyday , first six week , many hour per night use treatment sleep disorder . This visit last approximately 1-1 ½ hour . Visit 2 : Within 1-48 hour completion 24-hour urine collection begin treatment sleep disorder , need bring urine specimen Diabetes Metabolic Research Center . A part urine store ( frozen ) possible test hormone call aldosterone , substance filter kidney ( salt creatinine ) , potential risk factor . Also visit , 2 tablespoon blood drawn store potential test protein blood call renin . You continue dietary suggestion ( e.g. , liberal salt diet ) give collection 24-hour urine blood collect . A part blood drawn visit also store ( frozen ) case potential risk factor heart rate variability discover future . This visit last approximately 15 minute . Since drug affect much heart speed slows , doctor add new drug change dosage current drug may able continue study . Please inform member research staff doctor make change medication . Before come Diabetes Metabolic Research Center visit 3 , need determine use device treatment sleep disorder enough six week period . Therefore , member research staff call weekly basis ask tell u information record diary regard often used device treatment sleep disorder . Visit 3 ( approximately six week begin treatment sleep disorder ) : If use device use treat sleep disorder enough , invite come visit 3 . All test perform first visit perform visit 3 . Thus , need follow instruction food , medicine , exercise describe visit 1 come visit 3 . You fingerstick blood sugar level perform . In addition , 2 tablespoon blood drawn . This blood random urine sample store ( frozen ) case possible risk factor reduce heart rate variability discover future case factor need examine treatment sleep disorder . The question ask regard likelihood fall asleep various situation ask . This visit last approximately 1-1 ½ hour . Visit 4 ( approximately 18-months begin treatment sleep disorder ) : If continue use device use treat sleep disorder 18-months , invite come visit 4 . All test perform first visit perform visit 4 . Thus , need follow instruction food , medicine , exercise describe visit 1 come visit 4 . You fingerstick blood sugar level perform . In addition , 2 tablespoon blood drawn . This blood random urine sample store ( frozen ) case possible risk factor reduce heart rate variability discover future case factor need examine treatment sleep disorder . For individual diabetes , small portion blood check determine blood sugar control level . The question ask regard likelihood fall asleep various situation ask . This visit last approximately 1-1 ½ hour .</detailed_description>
