	<detailed_description>We want find specific characteristic person 's gene cause respond differently alcohol . Genes part chromosome find cell body control physical characteristic color hair , eye , feature . Genes make molecule call `` DNA '' carry genetic information receive parent . Just gene control physical characteristic , difference genetic information may also explain people sensitive alcohol problem drink much .</detailed_description>
