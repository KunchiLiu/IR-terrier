	<detailed_description>Morbidity cardiopulmonary bypass . Each year million patient worldwide undergo cardiac surgery . Nearly cardiac surgery perform unbeating heart support CPB . Although use off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery procedure increase , concern regard incomplete revascularization reduce venous graft patency limit use technique specific patient . CPB activate various humoral cascade include coagulation cascade , KKS , fibrinolytic cascade , cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome . Activation system lead hypotension , fever , disseminate intravascular coagulation , diffuse tissue edema , , extreme case , multiple organ failure . Activation KKS contribute hemodynamic perturbation , fibrinolysis inflammatory response observe patient undergoing CPB . Aprotinin , non-specific serine protease inhibitor , work part decrease bradykinin generation , decrease fibrinolysis , hypotension systemic inflammatory response associate CPB . Aprotinin decrease blood loss transfusion requirement , however , use mainly limited redo-cardiac surgery cost . Other factor may limit widespread use aprotinin include increase risk renal dysfunction , allergic reaction non-specificity drug . Bradykinin mediate effect KKS . Thus , bradykinin receptor antagonism potential modulate effect KKS activation CPB . The purpose proposal test hypothesis endogenous bradykinin contributes hemodynamic , fibrinolytic inflammatory response CPB bradykinin receptor antagonism reduce hypotension , inflammation transfusion requirement . The proposed study promise lead novel therapy reduce morbidity associate CPB . Cardiopulmonary bypass activate kallikrein-kinin system ( KKS ) . Several group , include , report bradykinin concentration increase CPB . For example , Campbell et al demonstrate bradykinin level increase 10 20-fold first 10 minute CPB , return basal level 70 minute CPB remain 1.7 5.2-fold elevate CPB . Plasma tissue kallikrein reduce 80 60 % respectively , first minute CPB . Similarly , demonstrate bradykinin increase significantly CPB ACE inhibition smoke potentiate kinin response CPB . Fibrinolytic response cardiopulmonary bypass . CPB increase t-PA antigen activity time-dependent manner . The fibrinolytic response CPB heterogeneous , t-PA level vary much 250-fold . The mechanism t-PA release CPB likely multifactorial . As outline , others show CPB increase bradykinin , potent stimulus t-PA release . In addition , thrombin complement generate CPB may stimulate release t-PA endothelium . In addition change t-PA concentration CPB , PAI-1 activity fall hemodilution rise t-PA release consumes active PAI-1 . Plasmin generation increase 100-fold D-dimer generation increase 200-fold within 5 minute CPB initiation . For remainder CPB , average plasmin D-dimer level remain 20-fold 30-fold baseline level . The postoperative period mark systemic inflammatory response cause combination CPB surgery produce acute -phase response result increase PAI-1 production . PAI-1 level begin rise 2 hour surgery . Once CPB , PAI-1 level continue rise peak first 12-36 hour postoperatively return normal second postoperative day . Thus , fibrinolytic response CPB characterize initial hyperfibrinolytic phase begin rapid rise t-PA , plasmin , D-dimer concentration follow postoperative hypofibrinolytic phase associate rise PAI-1 secretion fall t-PA concentration . Interaction renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) , KKS fibrinolytic system . There evidence fibrinolytic balance regulate RAS KKS . ACE strategically poise control fibrinolytic balance promote breakdown bradykinin conversion Ang I Ang II . Ang II cause release PAI-1 thus inhibit fibrinolysis . Bradykinin stimulate t-PA release B2 receptor . ACE inhibition decrease PAI-1 antigen level increase endothelial t-PA release endogenous bradykinin . In addition , ACE inhibition enhance exogenous bradykinin-mediated vasodilation t-PA release . The augmentation bradykinin-induced vasodilation , increase t-PA decrease PAI-1 describe ACE inhibition patient ischemic heart disease may contribute primary mechanism anti-ischemic effect associate chronic ACE inhibitor therapy . We demonstrate inpatient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) require CPB , ACE inhibition increase fibrinolytic activity decrease PAI-1 antigen increase t-PA activity , also enhance kinin response . Increased PAI-1 concentration perioperative period associate acute vein graft thrombosis . Thus , ACE inhibitors potential reduce risk acute graft thrombosis effect Ang II generation attenuate PAI-1 response CABG . As opposed beneficial effect ACE inhibition PAI-1 , augmentation kinin response CPB may detrimental effect include increased fibrinolysis consequent bleed hypotension . The effect angiotensin II type 1 ( AT1 ) receptor antagonist fibrinolytic response CPB know . Inpatients essential hypertension AT1 receptor antagonist decrease PAI-1 antigen study . In Specific Aim 1 test hypothesis angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor AT1 receptor antagonist modulate fibrinolytic inflammatory response CPB differently . Bradykinin receptor antagonism could reduce hypotensive response CPB . Low systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) commonly occur early CPB . It usually transient easy treat . Occasionally , patient severe persistent fall SVR , refer postoperative vasodilatory shock . Risk factor vasodilatory shock include preoperative use ACE inhibitor , low leave ventricular ejection fraction heart failure syndrome . Treatment frequently require maintain adequate perfusion pressure CPB establish satisfactory hemodynamics ready separate patient bypass . This usually entail counteract effect vasodilatory mediator administration drug norepinephrine phenylephrine . Although usually effective safe , drug redistribute blood flow way compromise splanchnic renal circulation . Several mediator think responsible produce postoperative shock , include bradykinin . For example , inverse correlation bradykinin concentration mean arterial pressure CPB , suggest bradykinin important mediator decrease SVR . We others show bradykinin induces vasodilation B2 receptor . In contract , B1 receptor stimulation cause vasodilation . As outlined PRELIMINARY STUDIES , demonstrate endogenous bradykinin contribute protamine-related hypotension follow CPB bradykinin receptor antagonism administer prior protamine attenuates hypotensive response . In Specific Aim 2 test hypothesis bradykinin receptor antagonism modulate hemodynamic change observe CPB . Bradykinin receptor antagonism could reduce hyperfibrinolysis CPB-associated blood loss . Inhibiting hyperfibrinolysis CPB reduce blood loss blood product requirement . On hand , modulate hypofibrinolytic phase CPB potential reduce thrombotic complication . We others show bradykinin stimulates t-PA release human forearm vasculature coronary circulation NO synthase-independent , cyclooxygenase-independent pathway . As vasodilation , bradykinin-stimulated t-PA release mediate via B2 receptor . Several group report bradykinin concentration increase CPB . We demonstrate direct correlation bradykinin t-PA concentration CPB suggest bradykinin play important role activate fibrinolytic response CPB . As outlined PRELIMINARY STUDIES show HOE 140 ( B2 receptor antagonist ) administer prior CPB blunts increase D-dimer similar e-aminocaproic acid . Thus , B2 receptor antagonism potential reduce bradykinin-mediated fibrinolysis CPB . In Specific Aim 2 test hypothesis bradykinin receptor antagonism modulate fibrinolytic response observe CPB . Bradykinin receptor antagonism could reduce inflammatory response CPB . During CPB , exposure blood bioincompatible surface extracorporeal circuit , well tissue ischemia reperfusion associate procedure , induce activation several major humoral pathway inflammation . Bradykinin produce many characteristic inflammatory state , change local blood pressure , edema , pain , result vasodilation increase microvessel permeability . Bradykinin activate NF-kB upregulates interleukin ( IL ) -1b TNFa-stimulated IL-8 production B2 receptor . In addition , bradykinin stimulates release IL-6 variety cell . The grow knowledge biological role kinin , particular inflammation , fuel development potent selective kinin receptor antagonist potential therapeutic . For example , bradykinin antagonist , deltibant ( CP-0127 ) show significant improvement 28-day risk-adjusted survival patient gram-negative sepsis . In animal model intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury , B2 receptor antagonism inhibit reperfusion induce increase vascular permeability , neutrophil recruitment expression B1 receptor mRNA . The role B2 receptor antagonist myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury controversial . Kumari et al demonstrate protective effect HOE 140 vivo ischemia-reperfusion injury , whereas isolated rabbit heart study , CP-0127 impair recovery acute coronary ischemia . This contradictory result may result different antagonist use , difference species sensitivity different experimental protocol . The role B1 receptor antagonist inflammation unclear . In contrast constitutively express bradykinin B2 receptor , bradykinin B1 receptor expression upregulated follow inflammatory insult ischemia-reperfusion injury . It appear kinin receptor subtype mediate different aspect inflammatory response . However , B1 receptor antagonism administer prior CPB may detrimental . For example , Siebeck et al demonstrate B2 receptor blockade attenuate endotoxin-induced mortality pig , whereas additional B1 receptor blockade seem reverse beneficial effect . Taken together , B2 receptor antagonism may decrease acute inflammatory response whereas additional B1 receptor blockade may harmful . These study , also fact aprotinin exerts part beneficial effect reduction bradykinin concentration , suggest hypothesis pharmacological strategy block bradykinin B2 receptor may superior reduce bradykinin concentration modulate inflammatory response CPB . The RAS , KKS inflammation . Activation RAS exert proinflammatory effect . For example , Ang II activate transcription factor nuclear factor ( NF ) -kB , turn regulate gene involve cellular recruitment inflammatory cytokine cascade . Ang II induce synthesis secretion inflammatory interleukin ( IL ) -6 . As mentioned , bradykinin produce many characteristic inflammatory state upregulates IL-1b TNFa-stimulated IL-8 stimulates release IL-6 . Thus , Ang II bradykinin stimulate release IL-6 . ACE inhibitor treatment associate reduction IL-6 response CPB . In randomized non-blinded study , Trevelyan colleagues20 demonstrate ACE inhibition produce highly significant decrease 51 % release IL-6 patient identify high producer IL-6 -174 G/C polymorphism , whereas losartan similar less marked effect . Potential mechanisms variation IL-6 response ACE inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker may due differential effect Ang II formation bradykinin degradation . Furthermore , bradykinin-induced increase IL-6 protein total mRNA inhibit selective B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140 selective B1 receptor antagonist . In Specific Aim 1 test hypothesis angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin II type 1 ( AT1 ) receptor antagonist modulate fibrinolytic inflammatory response CPB differently .</detailed_description>
