	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence woman major problem significant medical , psychological , social consequence . Previous research urge incontinence , common form incontinence , demonstrated behavioral drug intervention effective , cure patient . Thus need improve conservative treatment urge incontinence woman . The primary objective project evaluate whether enhance drug therapy component behavioral training , include pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation , result well outcomes drug therapy alone urge incontinence community-dwelling woman . This project randomize controlled clinical trial . Sixty-four woman predominantly urge incontinence randomize . Stratification block randomization procedure use assign subject 8 week drug therapy alone 8 week drug therapy enhance component behavioral training administer outpatient clinic . The drug therapy extend release oxybutynin , well-established pharmacologic agent state art drug delivery system low rate side-effect . The behavioral treatment innovative , comprehensive , behavioral training program , include pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation , teach urge suppression skill improve bladder control , self-monitoring bladder diary .
