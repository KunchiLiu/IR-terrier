	<detailed_description>Knee OA important cause disability fall overweight obese individual limit attempt exercise subsequent weight loss . Walking aid cane recommend management knee OA order decrease pain reduce load across knee increase physical activity . Little information available regard impact walk aid psychosocial function quality life individual limited mobility . No randomized control trial study efficacy walk aid quality life , pain , function overweight obese individual symptomatic knee OA ( 5,6 ) . The propose research evaluate effect walk aid knee OA test follow hypothesis use single-point cane ipsilateral contralateral affect limb decrease pain knee OA alter gait biomechanics improve walk function quality life overweight obese individual symptomatic knee OA .</detailed_description>
