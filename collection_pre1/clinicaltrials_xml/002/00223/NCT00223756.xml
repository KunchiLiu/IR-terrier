	<detailed_description>Abstract : Research Question : Estimates 854,000 severely visually impaired veteran year 2005 890,000 year 2010 . Statistics , base upon 2000 census , suggest well next decade number severely visually impaired veteran begin decrease . Waiting time admission VA blind rehabilitation center ( BRCs ) often year . Low vision service important aspect blind rehabilitation , 85 % veteran admit BRCs useful remain vision . In private sector , low vision service provide outpatient setting . Yet , legally blind veteran still encourage , require , attend regional inpatient program obtain therapy low vision device reimbursement model available outpatient blind rehabilitation low vision outpatient clinic rehabilitation professional provide training . The VA system need alternative service delivery option veteran unable participate inpatient rehabilitation . Outpatient low vision program provide continuity care regional BRC program insure local access low vision care high quality , timely , cost-effective . Currently , VERA Reimbursement Model allocate $ 27,826 per blind rehabilitation admission . Outpatient low vision program potential substitute inpatient low vision service costly inpatient rehabilitation program may necessary high functioning veteran . The purpose propose research measure effectiveness low vision outpatient program legally blind veteran central vision loss macular disease could provide local VA facility . Specific Objectives : 1 . Compare mean change self-report difficulty perform daily activity measure Veteran 's Affairs Low Vision Visual Function Questionnaire - 48 ( VA LV VFQ-48 ) read domain score baseline 4 month randomization [ two month veteran participate low vision outpatient program usual care ( wait list ) control group ] . 2 . Determine mean change VA LV VFQ-48 composite reading domain score baseline 4 month randomization [ two month veteran participate low vision outpatient program usual care ( wait list ) control group ] predict baseline measure visual impairment , functional status life state explain measure functional status rehabilitation . 3 . Perform economic evaluation cost cost-effectiveness low vision outpatient program . 4 . Compare mean change VA LV VFQ-48 score clinical trial baseline 4 month randomization ( two month veteran participate low vision outpatient program ) historical data mean change VA LV VFQ-48 score Hines BRC program . Hypothesis : Compared usual care ( wait list ) control group , veterans treatment group self-report reduction .78 logits difficulty perform daily living activity measure VA LV VFQ-48 reading domain score baseline 4 month randomization ( two month veteran participate low vision outpatient program ) .The .78 logit change clinically significant , improvement corresponds change visual ability would accompany 6-line improvement EDTRS visual acuity chart . Significance : The NIH include visual impairment , chronic visual deficiency impair everyday function correctable ordinary glass , among 10 prevalent cause disability America . Persons confront vision loss often feel limited frustrate perform everyday activity reading , travel place place , recognize object people . As result , may experience loss self esteem , social isolation , difficulty work reduce independence . The low vision team evaluate level remain vision , prescribe special lens device technique use remain vision effectively . Low vision rehabilitation restore independence enable person vision loss perform daily living task independently home , work within community . Research Design : propose study randomize clinical trial conduct two site . Subjects 122 legally blind veteran Hines Hospital Heffner VAMC . Veterans randomize treatment new low vision outpatient program usual care ( wait list ) control group . Following low vision examination , veteran treatment group receive 5 ( 2-2 1/2 hour ) therapy session local VA sit one home visit evaluate home environment set prescribed device . The primary outcome measure change reading domain score VA LV VFQ-48 , telephone questionnaire subject self-report difficulty perform daily living activity community . Other measure include , instructor rating veteran 's visual skill use low vision device rehabilitation , visual skill read ( PEPPER VSRT ) , health status ( SF-36 ) , symptoms depression ( CES-D ) . Outcomes compare T test . Multiple linear regression model use identify predictor explain outcome . Costs cost effectiveness outpatient treatment compare treatment inpatient BRC evaluate .</detailed_description>
