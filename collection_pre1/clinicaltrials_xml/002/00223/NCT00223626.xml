	<brief_title>Topiramate Reduce Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter find primarily brain . High GABA level result low level dopamine , another neurotransmitter brain 's `` feel good '' chemical play primary role cocaine drug addiction . Cravings cocaine reduce lower dopamine level . This make topiramate , GABA-altering medication , potential treatment cocaine addiction . This study evaluate subjective , behavioral , physiological effect topiramate individual addict cocaine . Potential participant initially attend 4- 6-hour screening session . This include review medical drug history , standardize psychological questionnaire , physical exam , blood collection . Eligible participant admit inpatient clinic . During first day experiment , participant receive instruction information study procedure . They also undergo physical exam , electrocardiogram , standardized psychological questionnaire , blood urine collection . A single test dose cocaine administer intravenously participant ensure safety continuation study . Vital sign monitor hourly throughout day . The experiment last 25 day enroll 24 individual addict cocaine . In three-part experiment , participant admit inpatient clinic 8-day study session . Following session , discharge clinic 1-week washout phase . Participants return inpatient clinic another 8-day study session . The two study session identical . During session , participant first receive topiramate placebo 4 consecutive day . While continue receive topiramate placebo , participant also receive intravenous cocaine placebo 3 consecutive days.Participants monitor study physician . Electrocardiograms use monitor heart activity , blood drawn frequently monitor level cocaine topiramate . Participants complete standardized questionnaire several time day ass mood change cognitive function .</detailed_description>
