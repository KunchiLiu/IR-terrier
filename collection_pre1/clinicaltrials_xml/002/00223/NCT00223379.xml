	<brief_title>Longitudinal Endodontic Study Apical Preparation Size</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize clinical trial compare clinical success two commonly use technique perform non-surgical endodontic procedure teeth chronic apical periodontitis pulpal origin . The first method , term `` GT method '' use commercially available rotary file system instrument root canal system crown apical portion root . After completion technique , apical portion root prepare standardized ISO size # 20 root ( i.e. , 0.2 mm cross-sectional diameter ) . The second method , term `` Lightspeed method '' use different commercially available rotary file system shape root canal system apical crown portion root . After completion technique , apical preparation often large cross-sectional diameter observe GT method ; however , equally important distinction Lightspeed method customize final cross-sectional diameter root canal system , thus root similar enlargement apical preparation size due proportionate removal infect dentin end root . Although Lightspeed method may result reduce bacteria apical portion root canal system , evidence date effect improve clinical success rate . This study test hypothesis large apical preparation size produce Lightspeed instrumentation system produce high percentage clinically successful treatment teeth apical periodontitis ( AP ) compare GT method</detailed_description>
