	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect intensive , constraint induced language therapy ( CILT ) individual chronic aphasia compare traditional aphasia therapy . The specific objective propose research determine effect therapy type ( CILT vs. traditional ) dose density ( intensive distribute ) speech therapy outcome . In addition , investigate functional qualitative impact intervention functional communication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Aphasia acquire language disorder common sequela stroke pose tremendous level handicap victim well burden caregiver . While efficacy aphasia rehabilitation find statistically significant effect ( Wertz et al. , 1986 ; Robey , 1994 ) , clinical significance often disappointing ( Siegel , 1987 ) . A promising avenue rehabilitation chronic aphasia base approach principle Constraint Induced Movement Therapy ( CIMT ) recently describe ( Pulvermuller et al. , 2001 ) . These investigator report individual chronic , stable aphasia benefit ( statistically well clinically ) language therapy design include attribute CIMT ( forced-use deliver high dos relatively short period time ) . In limitation study , condition constraint-induced language treatment ( CILT ) traditional treatment confound difference treatment intensity . A pilot study fund VA Rehabilitation Research &amp; Development ( RR &amp; D ) begin control confound variable treatment intensity currently underway collaboration Houston VAMC Center Excellence Healthy Aging Disabilities Brain Rehabilitation Research Center Excellence Gainesville , FL . While data collection ongoing , preliminary result suggest individual chronic aphasia make substantial , measurable change language battery follow intensive CILT . The purpose study expand pilot work do identify functional qualitative impact intervention communication naturalistic setting caregiver . Specifically , compare relative impact therapy type ( constrain , force speech TX vs. multi-modal PACE TX ) dose intensity ( massed practice distribute ) rehabilitation chronic aphasia . Research Plan : Using group comparison multiple-baseline single subject comparison , examine impact CILT large group individual aphasia , control confound variable mass practice , force use relevant context . In addition , investigate functional qualitative impact intervention communication naturalistic setting . Methods : A total 48 subject collect three site ( Houston , Gainesville Tampa VAMCs ) randomly assign across four experimental condition : 1 ) intensive CILT ; 2 ) intensive PACE therapy ; 3 ) distribute CILT 4 ) distribute PACE therapy . Pre post treatment language assessment , discourse sample , daily probe measure qualitative interview use measure TX effect . In addition , measure recollect one month follow TX assess stability TX effect .</detailed_description>
