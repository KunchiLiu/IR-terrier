	<brief_summary>1 . To characterize microstructure ( fracture toughness , particle size ceramic , inter-particle spacing ) three ceramic material 2 . To test hypothesis low fracture toughness glass and/or crystal phase ceramic reduce wear damage enamel . 3 . To test hypothesis small sized crystal reduce wear damage enamel . 4 . To test hypothesis large inter-particle spacing reduces wear damage enamel . 5 . To test hypothesis equivalent wear pattern exist direction enamel versus enamel ceramic versus enamel . 6 . To test hypothesis bite force correlate wear rate . 7 . To test hypothesis salivary flow correlate wear rate . 8 . To test hypothesis great amount wear associated loss vertical dimension occlusion . 9 . To test hypothesis great amount wear correlate secondary cementum deposition part passive eruption process . 10 . To test hypothesis maximum wear occur early wear rate level within first two year . 11 . To test hypothesis vitro wear analysis correlate vivo wear measurement</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 36 teeth ( 1 crown per patient ) need crown select follow acceptance criterion : 1 . Subjects must 18 year age good overall health . No contraindication dental treatment must present . 2 . Subjects must overall good dental health active tooth decay ( caries ) present periodontal disease . Pocket depth remain teeth must 4 mm . 3 . Subjects must exist temporomandibular disorder , ( e.g . clicking , popping , pain open ) parafunctional habit ( e.g . bruxism , clench ) 4 . Subjects must need crown either second premolar , first molar second molar arch . Abutment teeth must restorable crown root ratio least 1:1 . Abutment teeth must complement oppose non-restored minimally restored natural teeth . Minimally restored mean nothing beyond Class II amalgam restoration . Opposing arch full coverage restoration partial denture . Contralateral tooth must preferably present . 5 . Subjects must exhibit good oral hygiene compliance . 6 . Subjects must exist condition could limit flow saliva ; e.g . saliva flow must normal quantity . Baseline data collect consist : 1 . General medical history physical examination 2 . Primary cast take polyvinylsiloxane impression material 3 . Bite force measurement Newtons use gnathodynamometer 4 . Pocket depths abutment teeth must record 5 . Periapical radiograph abutment teeth . Radiographs take exact position use longitudinal radiographic analysis ( LRA ) technique . 6 . Vertical dimension measure nasion low point chin 7 . A saliva sample collect ascertain quality ( viscosity ) quantity . The parameter analysis salivary pH , buffer capacity , secretion ( ml/min ) , protein ( mg/ml ) , phosphate ( mmol/l ) , Ca ( mval/l ) , Na ( mval/l ) , K ( mval/l ) . A total 36 teeth randomly assign receive either metal-ceramic ( D'Sign ) all-ceramic crown ( IPS Empress2 , Eris EXC ) . Randomization do random number table . Teeth prepare two operator : Dr. Josephine Esquivel-Upshaw Dr. William Rose General Dentistry department . Provisional restoration make Integrity ( Dentsply , USA ) final impression make polyvinylsiloxane material use two-stage technique . Master cast mount centric relation . A single unit crown make either two type all-ceramic material metal-ceramic material cement dual cure resin cement . Adjustments make high-speed handpiece fine diamond bur . Prior cementation , adjust surface must polish glaze . Occlusal surface thickness crown measure baseline . Baseline examination perform one week cementation ensure patient comfortable crown adjustment need . A polyvinylsiloxane impression make maxillary mandibular arch record cement crown antagonist arch . The post-cementation cast pour Type IV gypsum product enable proper scanning . A 3D Laserscanner use scan x , z plan tooth/teeth cast make natural teeth . The vertical dimension record well periapical radiograph take abutment teeth . The subject ask return six month cementation . Polyvinylsiloxane impression make maxillary mandibular arch pour Type IV stone . The antagonist teeth crown scan use 3D Laserscanner . Superimposition baseline image six-month image perform amount wear three dimension calculate mathematically . Vertical dimension occlusion also determine measurement nasion low point chin periapical radiograph take restored teeth use LRA technique . This procedure repeat every year next four year . The amount wear micron determine x , z ax . Data subject one-way ANOVA ( Î± = 0.05 ) determine significant difference wear natural antagonist teeth ceramic crown baseline yearly 3D image also difference wear yearly 3D image . Occlusal thickness restoration determine base amount wear calculate . Any presence crack fracture record . Correlation amount wear change vertical dimension root cementum length also determine comparison nasion-chin height different interval .</detailed_description>
