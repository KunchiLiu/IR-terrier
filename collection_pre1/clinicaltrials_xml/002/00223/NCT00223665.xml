	<brief_summary>Sometimes blood level prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) rise men prostate surgery receive radiation therapy localize prostate cancer . A low value PSA desirable may indicate tumor growth . Giving hormone therapy intermittently ( cycle treatment treatment period ) appear delay change prostate cancer type prostate cancer resist hormone therapy . If , prostate cancer treatable long period time , well improve quality life . Mental functioning monitor therapy see treatment impact memory ability carry task . In addition , extra tube blood obtain test Amyloid-B protein ( AB protein ) whose presence may associate problem solve decline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Hormone Therapy Men With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate effect intermittent androgen suppression time androgen independent progression overall survival men localize prostate cancer . Subjects also evaluate effect intermittent androgen suppression quality life musculoskeletal , cardiovascular , neuropsychiatric system . The subject study rise PSA value definitive therapy either radical prostatectomy external beam irradiation treatment prostate cancer . All subject male , age 18 year . New subject introduce study protocol ( along non-study treatment option ) clinic visit Dr. Higano another sub-investigator . If informed consent obtain , subject undergo follow screening procedure start treatment : Bone density scan ; bone scan ; CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis ; blood draw ; problem solve test ; quality life emotion questionnaire ; body composition test . Subjects begin androgen suppression two-week lead-in flutamide , follow 9 monthly injection leuprolide acetate . During treatment , quarterly clinic visit blood draw hematology , chemistry , liver function , lipid . Their PSA level monitor monthly , PSA reach appropriate nadir month 9 , androgen suppression interrupt . At end treatment cycle , subject undergo another bone density test , blood draw , body composition test , problem solve test , complete quality life emotion questionnaire . During `` treatment '' phase , subject quarterly clinic visit , blood draw chemistry , hematology , liver function , lipid , well quarterly cognitive function test . PSA testosterone monitor monthly . Once PSA reach appropriate threshold , subject perform another set screening procedure resume treatment another 9 month . This cycle continue patient withdraws study , take study due toxicity decision investigator , treatment longer effective control prostate cancer . The problem solve test perform subject 's first cycle treatment ( consist 9 month treatment , entire treatment period afterwards ) .</detailed_description>

If less 30 month since completion radiation therapy , biopsy prostate suggest within 6 month study entry . If equal 30 month since completion radiation therapy , biopsy prostate suggest within 1 year . Written informed consent . Abnormal bone scan suggestive metastatic osseous disease . Previous hormonal manipulation include orchiectomy medication significant antiandrogenic activity ( combine androgen suppression 9 month , monotherapy antiandrogens , estrogen , ketoconazole ) . *Neoadjuvant androgen suppression therapy less equal 3 month allow , androgen suppression therapy complete equal 1 year prior study enrollment AND Testosterone level within normal range . Any systemic chemotherapy curative radiotherapy within 6 month . Hepatic dysfunction ( bilirubin : great 2.0 mg/dl and/or SGOT , LDH : great 3 time upper limit normal range ) .
