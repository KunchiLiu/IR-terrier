	<brief_title>Safety Study Combination Therapy With Intramuscular Avonex Oral Cellcept Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Uni-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study Avonex + placebo v Avonex + Cellcept Rationale : A number immunopathogenic mechanism hypothesize figure prominently process culminate characteristic plaque lesion . These include role cytokine , chemokines , excitatory amino acid , free radical , superoxide , nitric oxide synthetase product . Recognizing disease process MS involve cascade biological event , set stage strategically target specific immunopathogenetic step rational combination therapy regimens . We propose combination clinical trial utilize Avonex mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , novel agent broad spectrum anti- inflammatory mechanism . - Study population : MS patient diagnose clinically definite , laboratory support definite , monosymptomatic MS meeting CHAMPS criterion ref , either sex , age 21 50 inclusive . - Treatment Groups : 12 patient group , ALL patient Intramuscular Avonex . Cellcept/Placebo start 250mg bid one week escalate 250mg bid target dose 1000mg bid achieve Avonex 30 mcg IM q week Patients also see examine physician every three month , brain MRI scan do every month donate WBCs procedure call leukapheresis ( do every six month ) . - Efficacy Parameters/Evaluations : EDSS , PSAT , MSFC MRI , relapse rate safety measure - Safety Parameters/Evaluations : Safety assess virtue change T2/FLAIR lesion ( number volume ) gadolinium enhancement ( measure 6 12 month treatment initiation ) compare baseline measurement derive one pretreatment run- scan . In addition , variety clinical assessment perform period 12 month treatment . We enroll 12 patient group ( 24 total )</detailed_description>
