	<detailed_description>The overall purpose study develop improved gait analysis system real time acquisition , calculation interpretation joint kinematic kinetic information use link segment body model animation display visually depict deviation normal motion joint function . Subjects study use standard protocol use patient evaluation Rehabilitation Medicine Human Motion Laboratory ( GBO13 V AH ) . The standard protocol include routine collection kinematic data , kinetic data , foot pressure data , select case , electromyography information . All collect raw data ultimately process relevant biomechanical parameter utilized build either Normative Database Non-Normative Database select case maybe extract teaching purpose , pilot data software development . The project design test specific hypothesis statistical analysis plan . To acquire kinematics data , infrared reflective marker tap joint low extremity , trunk , arm . The reflective marker use conjunction optoelectronic kinematic motion analysis system ( Vicon ) allow acquisition 3D motion data limb trunk segment subject . Joint kinetics determine ground reaction force measure force plate embed floor gait laboratory require specific subject setup . Foot pressure data obtain Fscan . Mylar pressure sensitive strip place shoe residual limb . The strip connect datalogger battery pack put belt worn shoulder waist . When electromyographic data require , surface electrode place motor point region select muscle low extremity . After placement marker record electrode , subject instruct walk gait lab runway force platform . Simultaneous kinematic , EMG force plate data collect . Between 3 10 stride data collect depend degree variability gait pattern . When assistive device ( cane etc . ) orthotic device use , subject may ask ambulate without gait aid . Since patient recruit study abnormality gait , significant risk fall . Therefore , subject screen ensure ambulate independently level ground . During test , standby assistance present help subject case balance loss . The risk normal subject negligible .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Since desirable include spectrum gait disorder typically encounter clinical practice , inclusion/exclusion criterion patient limited . Patients must able walk independently without assistive device . Normal subject must history neuromuscular musculoskeletal disorder interfere ambulation .</criteria>
