	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine exercise affect clot blood ( hemostasis ) . The effect exercise hemostasis determine person spinal cord injury , population report increased prevalence cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . It expect study increase understand CVD person SCI , eventually help reduce occurrence premature heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Exercise Blood Coagulation Persons With Chronic Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular moderate intensity physical exercise decrease platelet aggregability consequence increase level tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) reducing level plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) . In addition , exercise-associated improvement lipid profile reduction fat mass may decrease platelet aggregability blood coagulation , well increase fibrinolysis . Thus , hypothesize physical exercise training powerful beneficial impact blood coagulation fibrinolysis . Although , regular exercise show reduce incidence CVD death cause regression symptom able-bodied individual , salutary effect prolong ( month ) exercise person SCI document . The present study evaluate effect hemostasis exercise training person chronic SCI . The effect exercise hemostasis determine person SCI , population appreciate increased prevalence cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . It anticipate study ultimately increase understand CVD group , eventually help reduce occurrence premature macrovascular disease .</detailed_description>
