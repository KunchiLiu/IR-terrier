	<detailed_description>This research study goal analyze plasma cell make part immune system . These cell , call white cell leukocyte , present blood . We want learn cell work prevent infection respond infection occur . We also want study certain molecule present plasma , cell , genetic material allows molecule make . These molecule may influence one person develop infection another , one person develop severe symptom disease others remain without symptom . This study may increase understand variety disease include infection HIV , allergic disease asthma , joint disease rheumatoid arthritis , certain cancer , rejection process sometimes occur transplantation organ .</detailed_description>
