	<brief_summary>In last decade , explosion new knowledge neuroscientific basis alcohol-seeking behavior . Briefly , medication modulate mesolimbic dopamine pathway facilitate gamma amino butyric function inhibit action excitatory amino acid reliably diminish alcohol 's rewarding effect . Topiramate ( sulfamate-substituted fructo-pyranose derivative ) characteristic . In support concept , show phase-II-type medication clinical trial topiramate significantly superior placebo improve drink outcome decrease craving among ( N = 150 ) alcohol-dependent individual . Using carefully control environment human laboratory , submit revise application contain set systematic study assess directly mechanistic neuropharmacological process associate topiramate 's anti-drinking effect . This provide comprehensive understand neurobiology alcohol-seeking behavior aid development even effective compound treatment alcohol dependence . Thus , specific aim project : 1 ) determine dose-relationship acute effect topiramate reduce alcohol effect relate abuse addiction potential . We hypothesize topiramate reduce alcohol-induced craving , reward , euphoria ; 2 ) determine whether chronic treatment acutely effective dose topiramate produce substantial reduction alcohol-related cue-induced craving , thereby decrease potential treatment relapse . We hypothesize chronic topiramate administration desensitize ( reduce ) alcohol crave produce alcohol-related sensory cue ; 3 ) determine whether topiramate interaction without alcohol associate neurocognitive impairment . Clinical study include suggested topiramate use may associate neurocognitive effect loss concentration memory impairment . In study , effect mild associate reduced treatment compliance . Since alcohol 's ability produce neurocognitive impairment may mediate similar ionic mechanism topiramate , propose human laboratory setting affords u unique opportunity clearly delineate topiramate 's neurocognitive effect presence absence alcohol . This study support NIAAA 's goal develop effective medication treat alcoholism understand basic underpinnings disease .</brief_summary>

History mental illness warrant treatment would preclude safe participation protocol except nicotine dependence , determine mental status psychiatric interview use Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV . Acute chronic organic brain syndrome , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , psychotic disorder . Significant medical illness ( include hypertension ) determine history and/or complete physical examination . Uncontrolled uterine cervical bleeding . History blood clot . Past problem oral contraceptive pill . Gross neurological disease . Mental retardation . Neurocognitive functioning &gt; 1.5 standard deviation expect range Clinically significant abnormality electrocardiogram preclude safe participation . History ischemic heart disease myocardial infarction . History glaucoma thyroid disease . Current infective hepatitis evidence clinical manifestations.. Positive pregnancy test . Women 35 smoke exclude participate research study . Participation human laboratory clinical study within last 30 day . Clinically significant laboratory screen test ( LST ) result hematology , chemistry , urine analysis define FDA Neuropharmacology Division guideline . Elevation liver enzyme ( SGOT ) , serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) — ×4 normal range — allow unless evidence hepatocellular disease failure . In addition , test hematocrit 300 ml blood take study 1 . Hematocrit level must &gt; 41 % male &gt; 38 % female . For study 1 , person weigh less 110 lb exclude , due amount blood take study 1 ( 300 ml ) . History severe lifethreatening reaction topiramate Past current history seizure . Past current history kidney stone . Use carbonic anhydrase medication . Being treated medication potential interaction alcohol topiramate . Pending imprisonment . For smoker , previous adverse reaction nicotine patch . Reporting experience crave alcohol ( selfreport ) . Postmenopausal woman recruit study .</criteria>
