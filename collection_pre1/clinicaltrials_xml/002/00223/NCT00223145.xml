	<brief_summary>The hypothesis propose study would , due six month total androgen blockade , would include neoadjuvant hormonal therapy four month concomitant hormonal therapy two month irradiation , investigator could reduce local failure rate two dosage level , namely 70 Gy 76 Gy . Since increase dose prostate also seem reduce local relapse rate , result two hormonal therapy group would compare result prostate irradiation dose 76 Gy . This study would verify possibility compensate six Gy dosage increase radiation therapy six month hormonal therapy 70 Gy 76 Gy group receive hormonal therapy , also match result dose escalation prostate 76 Gy . In future , could result therapeutic choice , reduce dos radiation therapy , consequently , related complication , hormonal therapy prove beneficial ; rather , continue direction dose escalation intermediate-risk patient group , everything correlate side effect hormonal therapy irradiation .</brief_summary>
