	<brief_title>Factors That Influence Compliance With Disease-Modifying Therapy Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While compliance rate interferon glatiramer acetate treatment high assess context control clinical trial , observe substantially less consistent rate drug administration general practice . Correspondingly , magnitude drug efficacy achieve clinical surrogate marker disease activity latter patient group may compromise compare patient participate controlled clinical trial . Further , many circumstance , perception breakthrough disease simply constitute treatment noncompliance . The National Multiple Sclerosis Society report 50 % MS patient 60 % relapse remit MS take disease modify agent U.S. ( Zwibel 2003 ) A number study investigate challenging issue . When glatiramer acetate therapy specifically evaluate , investigator find several factor associate compliance . They discover adherence higher patient perception physician support medication prescribe , patient sense control , high level hope previous use disease modify therapy ( Fraser , Hadjimichael , Vollmer 2001 ) . Another study Hadjimichael Vollmer ( 1999 ) survey patient reason medication discontinue . Disease progression , lack improvement side effect reason report patient stop disease-modifying therapy . Depression another factor find impact adherence . Mohr , Goodkin , Likosky , Gatto , Baumann Rudick ( 1997 ) saw increase rate compliance Interferon beta-1b therapy multiple sclerosis treatment underlie depression . The study show patient increase depression likely discontinue therapy . This link depression also demonstrate noncompliance antihypertensive medication . ( Wang , Bohn , Harooni et al . 2002 ) In another study , Mohr ( 2001 ) saw patient ’ experience level anxiety injection related adherence . We hypothesize number factor influence compliance DMA ’ , include : 1 . Patient factor 1 . Perceived quality life 2 . Empowerment , sense control &amp; hope 3 . Support structure ( family , faith , injection assistance , etc . ) 4 . Depression 5 . Fatigue 6 . Cognitive problem 7 . Perception drug efficacy ( benefit cost ) 2 . Physician ( HCP support ) factor 1 . Patient ’ perception MD support 2 . Relationship MD 3 . Access nurse HCP support function 4 . Services provide physician/clinical practice ( i.e . academic , community-based , MS clinic ) 5 . Adequate education MS , establish reasonable expectation concern benefit derive therapy , 3 . Drug factor 1. complexity drug administration 2. drug associate side effects/tolerability 3 . Perceived MS symptom control 4 . Insurance coverage injection 5 . Concomitant medication Once factor contribute noncompliance DMA therapy identify , healthcare professional evaluate impact . The healthcare team work towards address barrier possibility change , help improve patient outcomes . The primary objective study evaluate correlation patient factor , HCP support factor , drug factor , compliance patient relapse form multiple sclerosis ( RMS ) treat Disease Modifying Agents ( DMA ) . The secondary objective study determine difference patient compliance patient treat academic centers/MS specialist community neurology center ; determine factor impact difference . Patients ask sign ( electronic agreement ) consent participate confidential study initially log-on study website . Patients assign unique identification number log internet first time complete study survey . By use assigned number , health information protect individual . Patient name use purpose check distribution participation follow study patient consent . If patient drop study , TNS Healthcare contact patient find reason . The treat physician know elect participate study . Study Design- This multicenter , retrospective trial administer patient survey . We utilize validate MS quality life 54 ( MSQOL-54 ) , Beck ’ Fast Screen medical patient , Hope Herth Index , patient self-reported drug compliance survey . The participate neurologist ask give patient relapse form MS flyer describe study . The flyer direct patient designate study website complete confidential survey internet . As described , patient log-on website total 3 time study period , Baseline ( time 0 ) , Month 1 ( Time 1 ) Month 2 ( Time 2 ) . Patients log unique identification number rather names ensure confidentiality maintain throughout study . The goal equal number patient treat four different DMA ’ , AVONEX , Rebif , Copaxone , Betaseron . The sample include least 150-200 patient MS Centers 15-20 patient community site , total approximately 1040 patient . Power analysis perform assume 15 % critical effect value . The sample size calculate provide 80 % power detect critical effect value confidence interval 95 % . Response rate estimate 60 % first wave 75 % second wave questionnaire .</detailed_description>
