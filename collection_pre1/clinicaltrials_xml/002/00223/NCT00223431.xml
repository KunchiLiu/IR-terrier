	<brief_summary>Objectives : The purpose research determine clinical success rate lithia-disilicate-based core ceramic ( Ivoclar , Vivadent Corp. ) use posterior fix partial denture ( FPDs ) function bite force , cement type , connector height , connector width . Methods : Thirty ceramic FPD core framework prepare use hot-pressing technique lithia-disilicate-based core ceramic . The maximum clenching force measure patient prior tooth preparation . Connector height width measure FPD . Patients recall yearly cementation two year evaluate use eleven clinical criterion . All FPDs examine two independent clinician ranking criterion make 1 4 4 = excellent 1 = unacceptable . The aims research : 1 . To test hypothesis three-unit fix partial denture ( FPDs ) high-strength core ceramic exhibit good-to-excellent clinical performance ( base 11 evaluative criterion ) adequately resist fracture posterior situation ( exclude third molar ) fabricate minimal connector size ( 4 mm x 4 mm ) . 2 . To test hypothesis reinforce glass ionomer cement ( ProTec CEM , Ivoclar , Vivadent ) , use cement core ceramic crown posterior FPDs , associate significantly less marginal quality , similar fracture resistance ceramic crown compare marginal quality associate dual cure resin cement ( Variolink® II , Ivoclar Vivadent AG , Schaan , Liechtenstein ) . 3 . To test hypothesis significant difference tooth sensitivity associate FPDs cement glass ionomer cement dual-cure resin cement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient recruitment treatment perform University Florida College Dentistry , Graduate Prosthodontic Clinic Prosthodontic faculty . Patients initially screen exclude individual medical contraindication dental treatment , parafunctional habit , inability ensure residence area next five year . Inclusion criterion miss posterior tooth quadrant ( first premolars second molar ) could restore 3-unit FPD , periodontal pocket le 4 mm abutment periodontal disease , vital abutment teeth , crown root ratio least 1:1 . A patient multiple FPDs place long above-mentioned criterion meet . Baseline data obtain select subject include follow : 1 . General medical history physical examination 2 . Primary cast make irreversible hydrocolloid impression material 3 . Bite force measurement Newtons make gnathodynamometer 4 . Pocket depths abutment teeth 5 . Periapical radiograph abutment teeth . The maximum occlusal force exert subject measure prior commence treatment use bite force gauge report previously Gibbs et al.12 The purpose measurement analyze influence occlusal force survival FPDs . A total 30 FPDs fabricate 21 patient core ceramic patient recall year two year . Three clinician perform treatment one technician use in-house laboratory accomplish labwork . Out 21 patient , 18 female 3 male age range 30 62 year age . The 3-unit FPDs locate posterior area canine serve anterior abutment second molar posterior abutment . All FPDs oppose natural dentition . The dimension tooth reduction include least 1 mm axial reduction ; 2 mm occlusal reduction incorporation shoulder deep chamfer margin design round line angle . Final impression make use dual impression technique high low viscosity polyvinylsiloxane stock tray . Provisional resin FPDs make cement temporary cement . FPDs process hot-pressing core ceramic ( Ivoclar Vivadent AG , Schaan , Liechtenstein ) apply stain glaze necessary . The heat-pressed ceramic system use lose wax technique whereby FPD wax proper shape contour invest special flask special type investment material . The desired shade precerammed ceramic cylinder plasticize 1100oC pressed vacuum pressure mold investment.13 The ceramic FPDs inspect ensure incisogingival height curvature gingival embrasure connector adequate resist fracture subject normal biting force . The minimal dimension recommend premolar FPDs , 4 mm x 4 mm , molar FPDs , 4 mm x 5 mm , apply FPD esthetic gingival contour permit . Connector height width measure FPD use boley gauge . FPDs cement use either resin-reinforced glass ionomer cement ( Protec CEM , Vivadent ) dual-cure resin cement ( Variolink II , Vivadent ) use random number table . Fourteen ( 14 ) FPDs cement resin-reinforced glass ionomer 13 dual cure resin . Patients recall cementation annually two year evaluate follow clinical criterion : ( 1 ) tissue health ; ( 2 ) secondary caries ; ( 3 ) occlusion ; ( 4 ) proximal contact ; ( 5 ) marginal integrity ; ( 6 ) absence sensitivity percussion , heat , cold , air ; ( 7 ) color match ; ( 8 ) surface texture ; ( 9 ) absence wear oppose teeth ; ( 10 ) anatomic contour ; ( 11 ) cracks/chips fracture . This evaluative system derive California Dental Association quality assessment evaluation system.14 FPDs examine two independent clinician prepare teeth cement prosthesis , ranking criterion make 1 4 4 = excellent , 3 = good , 2 = unacceptable ( needs repair replacement near future ) , 1 = unacceptable ( needs immediate replacement ) . All clinicians/evaluators subject several calibration exercise consist table top analysis marginal opening well slide evaluation different clinical situation . Data analyze logistic regression analysis variable α = 0.05 . The consistency examiner ’ score evaluate consistency use test standard deviation inter-examination .</detailed_description>
