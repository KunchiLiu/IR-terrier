	<detailed_description>This study continue investigation optimal timing , intensity , duration robot-assisted training improve motor performance patient hemiplegia follow stroke . These hypothesis test : 1 ) subject receive robot-assisted upper limb therapy MIME initial phase recovery stroke experience great functional gain control group receive additional conventional therapy equal intensity duration , 2 ) robot-assisted therapy result dose-dependent response , 3 ) robot-assisted therapy promote great control movement , great recovery strength , great reduction co-contraction control intervention . Research Plan - A multi-site clinical trial progress Houston VA Medical Center ( VAMC ) , VA Greater Los Angeles Health Care System ( GLAHCS ) , VA Palo Alto Rehabilitation Research Development Center ( RR &amp; DC ) , Central Texas Veterans Health Care System ( CTVHCS ) . CTVHCS serve coordinate site . The RR &amp; DC provide train technical assistance site . Methods - Subjects hemiparesis due stroke randomly assign 3 group . Group 1 receive 1 hour/day robot-assisted upper limb therapy addition usual physical occupational therapy . Group 2 receive total 2 hours/day robot-assisted therapy . Group 3 receive 1 hour/day additional upper limb therapy include exposure , manipulation robot . Outcome measure include assessment strength , motor control , functional status , patient satisfaction intake , discharge , 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
