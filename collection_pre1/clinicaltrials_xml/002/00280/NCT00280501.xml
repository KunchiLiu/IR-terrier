	<brief_summary>There evidence variety animal study choroidal blood flow neural control . By contrast , little information available human study . Recent result indicate light/dark transition associate reduction choroidal blood flow due unknown mechanism . We show unilateral dark/light transition eye react choroidal vasoconstriction strongly indicate neural mechanism responsible blood flow change . Dopamine discuss chemical messenger light adaptation . However , dopaminergic effect eye restrict synaptic site release , dopamine also diffuse out retinal layer pigment epithelium . Accordingly , dopaminergic effect also include modulatory role retinal vessel diameter animal study provide evidence vasodilatory effect choroid . There evidence darkness retinal choroidal dopamine level decrease . Accordingly , dopamine could provide modulatory input light/dark transition induce change choroidal circulation . The aim present study test hypothesis .</brief_summary>
