	<detailed_description>The emergence novel influenza A virus strain human ( include subtype A/H5N1 , H7N7 H9N2 virus ) add urgency ongoing effort develop plan respond potential pandemic situation . This study compare safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity increase dos monovalent subvirion influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection healthy adult alone combine adjuvant aluminum hydroxide MF59 . The primary objective determine : dose-related safety subvirion inactivate H5N1vaccine without adjuvant healthy adult ; dose-related immunogenicity subvirion inactivate H5N1vaccine without adjuvant healthy adult approximately 1 month follow receipt 2 vaccine dos ; provide information selection best dosage level study . The secondary objective evaluate dose-related immunogenicity percent subject respond 1 7 month first vaccination . The primary endpoint : adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) information ; proportion subject dose group achieve serum neutralize antibody titer 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ; proportion subject dose group achieve serum hemagglutination ( HAI ) antibody titer 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ; geometric mean titer ( GMT ) frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer group 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ; geometric mean titer frequency 4-fold great increase serum HAI antibody titer group 28 day receipt second dose vaccine . The secondary endpoint : GMT frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer group 1 month 7 month receipt first dose vaccine ; geometric mean titer frequency 4-fold great increase serum HAI antibody titer group 1 month 7 month receipt first dose vaccine ; development serum antibody responses antigenically drifted variant H5N1 influenza virus . The primary outcome measure frequencies severity AEs group proportion subject achieve serum neutralize antibody titer 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus Day 56 . About 390 healthy adult , 18 64 year old , inclusive , enrolled multicenter , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging clinical trial . Nine group randomize subject receive two dos saline placebo influenza A/H5N1 vaccine 45 , 30 , 15 microgram ; influenza A/H5N1 vaccine 15 7.5 microgram MF59 ; influenza A/H5N1 vaccine aluminum hydroxide 30 , 15 , 7.5 microgram ( N=30 , 60 90/vaccine dose group total 390 ) . Laboratory safety profile blood drawn prior first immunization . Subjects receive 2 dos approximately 28 day apart . Subjects observed inoculation maintain memory aid 7 day afterwards . Subjects telephone 1 3 day vaccination AE assessment , return clinic Day 7 AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination , safety laboratory test review memory aid . Telephone call assess AEs perform vaccination . Serum safety laboratory test obtain prior approximately 7 day first second immunization . I</detailed_description>

Is use oral parenteral steroid , highdose inhaled steroid ( great 800 micrograms/day beclomethasone dipropionate equivalent ) immunosuppressive cytotoxic drug ( nasal topical steroid allow ) . Has history receive immunoglobulin blood product within 3 month prior vaccination study . Has receive license vaccine within 2 week ( inactivated vaccine ) 4 week ( live vaccine ) prior vaccination study . Has acute chronic medical condition , opinion investigator , would render vaccination unsafe would interfere evaluation response ( include , limited : know chronic liver disease , significant renal disease , unstable progressive neurological disorder , diabetes mellitus , transplant recipient ) . Has history severe reaction follow immunization contemporary influenza virus vaccine . Has acute illness , include oral temperature great 100.4 degree F , within 1 week vaccination . Received experimental agent ( vaccine , drug , biologic , device , blood product , medication ) within 1 month prior vaccination study , expect receive experimental agent 7month study period . Has condition would , opinion site investigator , place subject unacceptable risk injury render subject unable meet requirement protocol . Participated H5 vaccine study past .
