	<brief_summary>This study examine safety potential efficacy monoclonal antibody efalizumab ( Raptiva ) treat sight-threatening uveitis ( eye inflammation ) . Efalizumab control activity white blood cell call lymphocyte cause inflammation . The drug currently approve United States treat patient moderate severe psoriasis . Participants 18 old sight-threatening intermediate posterior uveitis least 3 month duration , cause persistent macular edema one eye , eligible study . The uveitis require treatment least 20 milligram per day prednisone , equivalent , combination two anti-inflammatory treatment prednisone , methotrexate , cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine , etc . Participants underwent follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination . - Weekly efalizumab treatment . - Weekly eye examination , include measurement vision pressure eye , dilation eye examination front back part eye . - Weekly blood test measure number type cell blood check sign inflammation treatment side effect . At visit , blood sample collect measure much efalizumab remain blood whether body develop immune response medicine . - Blood draw enrollment 2 4 month research test examine participant ' immune response operating . - Fluorescein angiography enrollment 1 3 month enrollment , unless additional test need , medical management . This test check abnormality eye blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina ( back portion eye ) take special camera flash blue light eye . The picture show whether dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible abnormality . - Monthly pregnancy test woman could become pregnant . Participants return treatment clinic visit weekly 16 week . After 16 week , participant whose macular edema decrease whose vision may improve offer continue injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Uveitis refers intraocular inflammatory disease important cause visual loss . Standard systemic immunosuppressive medication uveitis cause significant adverse effect . Consequently , effective treatment safer side effect profile highly desirable . Aims : This protocol evaluate safety potential efficacy subcutaneous ( SC ) efalizumab ( anti-CD11a ) treatment uveitis reduce eliminate standard medication commensurate standard care . If therapeutic benefit sustain use SC formulation , maintenance therapy continue clinically indicate . Methods : This open-label , non-randomized , clinical pilot study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant 18 year age old ; Participant diagnosis sightthreatening , intermediate posterior uveitis least three month duration prior original enrollment cause persistent cystoid macular edema one eye . Their disease require treatment control intraocular inflammatory disease least 20 mg/day prednisone ( equivalent ) combination two antiinflammatory treatment uveitis , include example prednisone , cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , methotrexate , etc . Participant exhibit intolerance indicate systemic medication require uveitis , though uveitis may control , wish take present medication due potential actual unacceptable side effect . Participant visual acuity least one eye 20/200 good . Participant normal renal liver function bad mild abnormality define Common Toxicity Criteria . Participant currently pregnant lactate . Both men woman reproductive potential sexually active agree use acceptable birth control method throughout course study six week follow last administration study medication . Participant must ability understand sign inform consent form . Participants receive previous treatment intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) lymphocyte functionassociated antigen1 ( LFA1 ) direct monoclonal antibody investigational agent would interfere ability evaluate safety , efficacy pharmacokinetics efalizumab . Participant significant active infection . Participant history cancer ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) diagnose within past 5 year .</criteria>
