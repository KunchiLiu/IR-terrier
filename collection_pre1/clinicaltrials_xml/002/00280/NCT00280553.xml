	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Bupivacaine Infusion Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain post-operative period limit factor delay recovery follow abdominal surgery . Furthermore , associate several complication include ileus , urinary retention , delay tolerate oral intake enteral feed , thrombo-embolic complication , respiratory complication atelectasis pneumonia . Diminishing pain post-operative period subject great study date role epidural analgesia , epidural anesthesia , patient control anesthesia narcotic analgesia well documented assist control pain , decrease morbidity accelerate recovery post-operative period follow colorectal surgery . Nevertheless , use opioid-based analgesic technique via epidural , nurse patient control delivery system either oral parenteral produce adverse effect nausea , vomit , ileus , delay tolerance urinary retention . Concomitant use non-narcotic base analgesic fail obviate need narcotic base analgesia . Recently , several company develop device deliver constant rate local anesthetic via spring load device multiport catheter insert incision . The effectiveness bupivicaine infusion pump demonstrate diminish post-operative pain follow orthopedic , plastic , thoracic cardiac surgery date role evaluate colorectal surgery abdominal surgery . The rational study bupivicaine infusion pump use St. Joseph 's Healthcare patient undergo laparoscopic assist colorectal surgery , anecdotally , patient less pain , need less narcotics ambulate discharge sooner . This pilot study aim gather prospective randomize data regard post-operative length stay patient pain score properly power randomization study undertaken understand bupivicaine infusion system help decrease length stay patient 's post-operative pain .</detailed_description>
