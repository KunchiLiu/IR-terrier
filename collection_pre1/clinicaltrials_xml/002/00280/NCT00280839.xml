	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoke pernicious national global public health problem.1 , 2 Nearly 50 million Americans smoke cigarette despite widely publicize acknowledge health warning restriction public smoking . Smoking brand important preventable cause death United States ( US ) , 45 % smoker die tobacco relate disorders.3 , 4 Tobacco dependence mediate , part , reinforce effect nicotine.5 According US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline , Treating Tobacco Use Dependence , every patient attempt stop smoking offer pharmacotherapy smoking cessation.6 Pharmacological treatment strategy include nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ( nicotine formulation ) ) , antagonist therapy ( mecamylamine ) , therapy make nicotine intake aversive ( silver acetate ) , non-nicotine medication mimic nicotine 's neurophysiological effect ( antidepressant ) , medication block crave withdrawal symptom ( nicotine formulation , antidepressant , clonidine ) . A number drug therapy smoke cessation demonstrate efficacy facilitate smoke cessation . These include NRT use variety nicotine formulation ( e.g. , pill , gum , patch , etc . ) ; 7-14 combined nicotine replacement mecamylamine ; 15 antidepressant , bupropion SR,16-19 nortriptyline,19-21 doxepin,22 fluoxetine ; 23 , 24 alpha2 agonist , clonidine ; 25-27 anxiolytic , buspirone.28 Among agent , first-line pharmacotherapies approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) include bupropion SR various NRT product find approximately double long-term abstinence rate compare placebo.29-31 However , roughly 7 8 10 individual use medication achieve long-term abstinence . I n addition limitation currently available treatment smoke cessation , several clinical factor complicate treatment nicotine dependence . First , patient history major depressive disorder appear low likelihood achieve sustain smoke abstinence increase risk depressive symptom emergence patient without history major depressive disorder.32-44 Second , emergence prominent mood symptom associate nicotine withdrawal ( e.g. , anxiety , dysphoric depress mood , insomnia , irritability , restlessness ) reduce likelihood abstinence.35 , 37 , 44 Third , appetite increase weight gain also components nicotine withdrawal negative health consequences.30 , 45 Activation mesocorticolimbic dopamine ( DA ) system implicated reinforce dependence-producing effect nicotine.46 , 47 However , attempt ameliorate symptom nicotine dependence/withdrawal use DA receptor therapeutic target meet modest success.48 , 49 Recent study rodents suggest glutamatergic activation N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor within ventral tegmentum ( VT ) may need nicotine stimulate dopamine release nucleus accumbens.50-52 These finding consistent reduction nicotine-induced increase locomotor activity observe microinfusion ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists.53 , 54 Thus , agent indirectly modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission mesocorticolimbic reward circuit via effect presynaptic glutamatergic input dopamine neuron offer promise novel adjuvant treatment nicotine addiction .</detailed_description>
