However , little scientific effort direct toward identify biological mechanism relate abnormal sleep evaluate efficacy behavioral treatment insomnia old adult . Basic observation demonstrate proinflammatory cytokine play key role regulation sleep . Previous research show cytokine reciprocally link abnormal sleep . This trial build upon finding extend program study examine efficacy behavioral intervention health outcomes elderly . Preliminary study find Tai Chi Chih ( TCC ) , slow move meditation , contribute improvement subjective sleep quality , sleep amount sleep efficiency , alteration sympathetic activity , decrease proinflammatory cytokine , improvement health function community-dwelling older adult .

In randomized , controlled trial , 150 old adult randomly assign CBT , TCC , sleep hygiene/education control ( EC ) 16 week follow one year . The aim project : 1 ) evaluate effect CBT v TCC vs. EC objective subjective measure sleep fatigue , mood , health function old adult insomnia ; 2 ) determine effect CBT vs.TCC vs. EC measure proinflammatory cytokine activity sympathovagal balance , whether two biological mechanism relate change disorder sleep course treatment trial ; 3 ) evaluate whether circulate level proinflammatory cytokine associate measure sleep continuity old adult insomnia treatment trial . This study advance psychobiological model disorder sleep potential benefit two readily exportable behavioral intervention promote improvement sleep outcome elderly .</detailed_description>
