	<detailed_description>The use RF ablation pulmonary tissue new . However previous report primarily description technique early procedural outcome . Follow-up study lack . This study provide information outcomes rate clinical response , overall survival , progression-free survival , dyspnea QOL . The determination efficacy technique study could make important contribution management patient pulmonary malignancy high operative risk resection . A minimally invasive alternative tumor destruction could potentially improve quality life control local tumor progression could provide long survival compare current non-surgical option . This pilot study determine potential utility effectiveness RFA treatment lung tumor , whether evaluate therapy prospective randomize clinical trial compare conventional modality . Lung cancer currently common cause cancer-related death USA represent second common malignancy men woman 171,400 new case year 1999 . Unfortunately , majority patient present advanced disease . Despite advance management disease , best 5-year survival stage I remain around 70 % patient undergone surgical resection . Complete resection provide best chance cure remain gold standard therapy patient acceptable surgical risk . The role surgical resection pulmonary metastasis select patient widely accept , survival advantage aggressive surgical therapy demonstrate . Surgical series demonstrate 5-year survival 25-42 % surgical treatment pulmonary metastasis different primary include colorectal cancer osteogenic sarcoma , melanoma , others . In prospective study 5,206 case lung metastasectomy , International Registry Lung Metastases report actuarial survival 36 % 5 year 26 % 10 year . These result compare favorably incomplete resection achieve survival 13 % 5 year 7 % 10 year . The standard resection primary lung cancer include lobectomy pneumonectomy depend size location tumor . Limited resection , include segmentectomy wedge resection lung , standard treatment limited metastasis good alternative patient primary lung cancer poor lung function tolerate large resection . However , prospective randomize trial address role limited resection primary lung cancer perform Lung Cancer Study Group 276 patient T1N0 NSCLC . Patients limited resection group suffer 50-75 % increase local recurrence rate , survival difference see two group . Limited resection however continue view good option metastasectomy compromise operation primary lung cancer . The treatment option patient pulmonary malignancy severe comorbidities poor pulmonary function limit . These patient many time consider surgical resection excessive risk undergo invasive operation often treat external beam radiation and/or chemotherapy . In case pulmonary metastasis occur previous pulmonary resection , resection sometimes feasible due limit residual pulmonary parenchyma dense adhesion . After widespread application radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) destruction unresectable liver tumor , technique consider alternative therapy ablation solid tumor . The initial experience treatment lung tumor RFA indicate technique appear safe feasible ablation peripheral lung nodule . The U.S. Food Drug Administration approve RFA coagulation necrosis soft tissue tumor . In addition , RFA widely use treatment pulmonary nodule France , Germany , Japan , Korea , People 's Republic China . Radiofrequency ablation system comprise three component : radiofrequency generator , active electrode , dispersive electrode . The RF energy introduce tissue via active electrode . As RF energy ( alternate current ) move active electrode dispersive electrode ( i.e. , electrosurgical return pad ) back active electrode , ion within tissue oscillate attempt follow change direction alternate current . This movement result frictional heating tissue , temperature within tissue becomes elevate beyond 60°C , cell begin die . It phenomenon cause region necrosis surround electrode . The advantage thermal intervention system capacity heat tissue lethal temperature specific anatomic location . The advantages procedure treatment non-resectable hepatic renal lesion reduce surgical trauma , short procedure time , short hospitalization , fast recovery time . In treatment lung nodule , allow destruction lung tumor minimal damage surround normal lung tissue . Coagulation necrosis soft tissue due RF ablation report liver , kidney , breast , lung tissue . Radiofrequency ablation primary metastatic hepatic lesion report result necrosis encompass 70 % 98 % tumor treat . To date , little report use RF ablation address pulmonary nodule . In presentation three case study , follow-up CT imaging note cell within region thermal lesion fibrotic one three patient residual disease detect . Using positron emission tomography ( PET ) image lung , series ten patient note within boundary thermal lesion evidence metabolic activity . A pre-clinical study undertaken porcine model order determine capacity RF energy induce necrosis lung tissue . Using differ power setting length application time , determine thermal lesion produce porcine lung tissue complete entire , procedure-related complication . Animals survive 3 , 7 28 day post-RF ablation active show evidence detrimental effect RF-induced necrosis respiratory capacity function . The region necrosis affect conductive heat loss via air blood flow presence bronchus , result invagination thermal lesion boundary ; however , cell within boundary nonviable . Determining effectiveness RF ablation usually involve follow-up compute tomography ( CT ) scan . CT image provide assessment tissue change follow ablation , manifest central cavitation lesion decrease tissue density measure decrease Hounsfield unit ( Hu ) . As complementary modality , positron emission tomography ( PET ) use determine tissue viability within lesion , useful follow-up patient . In particular , patient questionable response RFA determine CT scan benefit PET scanning , determine presence residual disease . The patient inject radio-labeled sugar ( typically 18 Fluoro-deoxyglucose FDG ) prior PET scan viability determine base upon uptake FDG cell , since FDG take cell high metabolic activity , tumor , infection , inflammation . In small pilot study , monitor PET note viable tissue within boundary thermal lesion induce pulmonary nodule . In investigator ' initial experience University Pittsburgh Medical Center , treat 18 patient RFA include primary metastatic lung tumor . Selected patient candidate complete surgical resection base surgical risk , multiple lesion , poor pulmonary reserve refusal surgery . Twenty-eight lung nodule treat RFA 18 patient ( 12 male , 6 female ) . Tumors include metastatic carcinoma ( 9 ) , sarcoma ( 6 ) lung cancer ( 3 ) . Mean age 52 year ( range , 27-95 ) . Thoracic surgeon perform RFA mini-thoracotomy ( 5 ) CT-guided percutaneously ( 13 ) general anesthesia operating room . In approach , patient position lateral decubitus position . In CT-guided procedure employ service CT technician thoracic surgeon place small finder needle center lung nodule . The surgeon confirm successful central placement finder needle CT imaging , LeVeen™ needle electrode size choose accord diameter target lesion . The needle electrode diameter 14 gauge 15 cm shaft length introduce center lesion CT guidance . Several application different location within lesion may require large mass , therapy begin distal area progress proximally . Chest tube require 46 % ( n=13 ) percutaneous procedure . Mean length stay 3 day ( range , 1-7 day ) . Complications include recurrent pneumothorax ( 1/18 ) , pneumonitis ( 6/18 ) , small pleural effusion ( 7/18 ) transient renal failure ( 1/18 ) . One death occur hemoptysis 19 day post-RFA central nodule . This patient also receive recent brachytherapy . After mean follow-up 4 month ( range , 1-11 month ) , compute tomography reveal resolution decrease density treat sit less 4 cm . Six patient ( 33 % ) die progressive metastatic disease follow-up period . Even though RFA use treat lung tumor 300 patient worldwide , still need define role RFA pulmonary malignancy . In particular effect RFA dyspnea quality life well follow-up study lack .</detailed_description>
