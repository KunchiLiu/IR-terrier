	<brief_summary>Patients liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma undergo transarterial chemoembolisation ( TACE ) clinically indicate randomize receive bevacizumab placebo every 2 week 1 year . Tumor response assess use MR liver PET-scanning . It test whether addition bevacizumab angiogenic inhibitor slow tumor progression , reduce need re-embolisation improve patient survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transarterial Chemoembolisation Plus Bevacizumab Treatment Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TACE establish therapy patient advanced stage HCC amenable liver transplantation resection show significantly improve survival patient compare treatment ( 8 ) . TACE take advantage predominantly arterial blood supply malignant liver tumor contrary surround normal liver tissue , receive blood supply portal venous system . TACE lead predictable tumor necrosis new blood vessel grow tumor margin support tumor growth . Quite often cut blood supply hepatic artery , tumor induces active angiogenesis promote collateral blood vessel growth liver capsule artery collaterals gastroduodenal artery . VEGF seem important player induce angiogenetic activity tumor control survival patient TACE link serum VEGF-levels high level show reduced survival . Inhibition neoangiogenetic activity could lead significantly improve tumor control survival patient advanced stage HCC . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVE - ass effectiveness bevacizumab combination TACE measure patient without tumor progression MRT 3 cycle TACE well number TACE cycle apply recurrent tumor maximum one year treatment bevacizumab - assess collateral tumor vessel growth MRT / CT</detailed_description>
