	<brief_summary>It know vast majority patient seek bariatric surgery weight reduction procedure non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , small subset patient within group serious liver problem know nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . NASH serious liver disease lead cirrhosis , liver failure ultimately liver transplantation . The purpose study explore effect bariatric surgery progression NASH . The investigator also hope gain insight gene may responsible development NAFLD NASH . The knowledge gain study advance field fatty liver disease help design rational treatment prevent disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protocol Assessment Variability Histology Gene Expression Bariatric Surgery Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) common cause abnormal liver test United States . NAFLD often find association obesity diabetes expect become increasingly prevalent incidence diabetes obesity continue increase . NAFLD represent range disease simple fatty deposition liver aggressive inflammation fibrosis , term nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . The distinction NASH entity within NAFLD important one , natural history disease different . Ultimately , NASH may progress cirrhosis 25 % patient , compare simple steatosis benign condition . NAFLD estimate 10-24 % various population significantly high obese population ( 57.5-74 % ) . NASH subset NAFLD characterize fatty change lobular inflammation , hepatocellular injury , progressive fibrosis cirrhosis . The bariatric surgery population ideal cohort study large subset NASH ; morbid obesity . The purpose study examine variability hepatic histology well expression key metabolic gene NAFLD/NASH patient undergo bariatric surgery . Patients undergo pre-operative laboratory testing , follow intra-operative liver fat biopsy . A 12-month follow consist repeat liver biopsy laboratory test . We predict histologic variability inflammation fibrosis NASH accompany differential gene expression . Furthermore , variability pronounce , temper reliance percutaneous liver biopsy NASH `` gold standard '' emphasize need global marker disease progression .</detailed_description>
