	<brief_summary>This research study do find genetic make person play role complication recovery Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) operation . As may aware , DNA ( Deoxyribonucleic acid ) chemical body carry genetic information . There common small variation ( polymorphism ) occur DNA . We would like find common variation put person increase risk develop complications- especially rapid irregular heart beat CABG operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation show increase length hospital stay ; markedly increase cost potentially increase incidence post-operative stroke . Nationally , postoperative atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common complication cardiac surgery , occur 25 % 40 % patient total cost billion dollar per year treat At University Pittsburgh Presbyterian University Hospital , past year , patient experience AF postoperative period average rate 30 % -40 % . The incidence postoperative AF increase age patient . The average age patient undergoes CABG surgery increase due improve longevity population . Coronary artery bypass graft associate systemic inflammatory response . There study perform assess relationship genetic polymorphism could affect expression cytokine interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) . Interleukin 6 pro-inflammatory cytokine major mediator acute phase response . The correlation -174 G/C polymorphism high production IL-6 enable investigator anticipate treat patient prophylactically reduce IL-6 level . 8 It suggest inflammation role development atrial arrhythmia cardiac surgery genetic predisposition develop postoperative complication exist . There study perform Europe ascertain association find -174G/C Interleukin-6 promoter gene variant appear modulate inflammatory response surgery influence development postoperative AF . These data suggest inflammatory component postoperative atrial arrhythmia genetic predisposition complication , polymorphism also correlate development postoperative renal pulmonary complication . Enrolled patient single blood sample 6 ml drawn prior CABG surgery . Any personal identifier blood sample tube remove code number specific research study affix sample research coordinator sample sent Genomics laboratory analysis .</detailed_description>
