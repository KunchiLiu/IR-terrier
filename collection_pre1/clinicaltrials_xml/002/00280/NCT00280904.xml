	<brief_title>A Registry Comparing Catheter-Related Infection Rates Among Various Shunt Systems Treatment Hydrocephalus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial show majority infection shunt system originate bacterial contamination introduce time surgery appear 3-4 week post-operatively . Protection must persist well beyond surgical procedure make certain contaminate bacteria completely eradicate . Depending upon institution , shunt infection rate know little 1 % much 25 % . However , two prospective trial publish large database , consistent definition infection , indicate overall infection rate approximately 10 % This prospective non-randomized , open-label Registry design investigate identify short-term shunt/catheter-related infection rate ventriculoperitoneal shunt system use various catheter hospital standard care treatment Subjects hydrocephalus . Prospective Subjects include receive shunt first time ( de novo ) previously implant shunt catheter total system replacement require . This Registry enroll 450 implanted Subjects age meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion provide sign Informed Consent participate clinical Registry Subjects follow 90 day .</detailed_description>
