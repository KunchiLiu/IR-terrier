	<detailed_description>White matter fiber track may provide novel tool ass integrity injure motor tract cervical spine . It provide information fiber direction give conventional MRI . White matter fiber track brain use several institution , include medical college , presurgical planning tumor excision . We believe technical clinical experience gain brain applied fiber track cervical spine well . White matter fiber track cervical spine important clinical application : - A good understanding relationship abnormal cervical spinal anatomy impact fiber tract would helpful determine best treatment particular patient . It may able define indication role surgical decompression stabilization base quantifiable reproducible data obtain new image technology . - It could help surgeon determine type surgical approach choose ( anterior versus posterior surgery , depend degree compression / impingement nerve fiber ) . - Correlation quantitative diffusion measure spinal cord injury may use monitoring response treatment may therefore important parameter clinician follow . - White matter fiber tracking may also help determine pathophysiology underlie cervical spondylotic myelopathy . Currently , debate whether cervical spondylitic myelopathy cause mainly compressive narrow spinal canal , may lead focal ischemia tissue injury , whether excessive motion due cervical spondylosis result increase strain shear spinal axon result injury ( Henderson et al. , Neurosurgery 56 ( 5 ) :1101-13 , 2005 ) . If latter correct one would expect diffusion change along course white matter track spondylotic change . We first study pool 15 normal control subject refine data acquisition postprocessing tool , sample quantitative diffusion base data normal cervical spine . A second group subject include 10 patient significant cervical spondylosis upper extremity radiculopathy without myelopathy . The third group 10 patient cervical spondylosis sign symptom myelopathy . The two patient group allow u define systematic difference normal value value injure spine . The DTI data process use tool artifact correction first tool render T2 weight image , diffusion weight image , ADC map FA value .</detailed_description>
