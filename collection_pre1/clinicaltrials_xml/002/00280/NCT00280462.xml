	<brief_summary>Autoregulation ability vascular bed maintain blood flow despite change perfusion pressure . For long time assume choroid strictly passive vascular bed , show autoregulation . However , recently several group identify autoregulatory capacity human choroid . In brain retina mechanism behind autoregulation likely link change transmural pressure . In model arteriole change vascular tone depend pressure inside vessel outside vessel . In choroid , several observation argue direct involvement arteriole . In previous project able identify nitric oxide ( NO ) - system well endothelin system involve choroidal blood flow regulation isometric exercise . In present study autoregulation choroid isometric exercise investigate pressure/flow relationship observe absence presence calcium antagonist - nifedipine .</brief_summary>
