	<detailed_description>The multistage theory carcinogenesis include development multiple activate genetic change due exposure carcinogen , either primarily , superimpose upon pre-existing mutation genome . These change result activation protooncogenes , lack expression tumor suppressor gene , combination , sum result malignant transformation . Detailed analysis chromosomal lesion bronchogenic lung cancer reveal several recur abnormality , include deletion , duplication polysomy chromosome 1 , 3 , 7 20 . Aberrations short arm chromosome 3 , particular , find many small cell non-small cell lung cancer , polysomy 7 frequent find non-small cell lung cancer . Many abnormality identify significance , however application current evolve technique molecular biology reveal specific genomic change lead malignant phenotype several tumor , example , application polymerase chain reaction amplification technique reveal strike incidence mutation h- k-ras protooncogenes discover , associate over-expression growth factor receptor , example epidermal growth factor receptor . As epithelial cell expose similar environmental condition , seem likely many cell undergo mutagenesis simultaneously . Clinically , frequently apparent , 10-20 % patient lung cancer another epithelial cancer arise , either concurrently , late time course . The predisposition development second malignancy also affect epithelial surface , example , strong tendency patient cancer head neck develop second malignancy ( bronchogenic lung cancer ) aerodigestive tract . Despite decrease smoke rate overall United States , projection 2025 indicate still 100,000 death annually lung cancer smoking-associated cancer . Therefore , would great benefit patient risk develop lung cancer identify change prior development invasive malignant lesion . This particularly true patient already developed cancer , patient strong family history may occupational ( eg. , asbestos ) habitual ( eg. , cigarette smoke ) exposure carcinogen . Identification cancer pre-clinical stage attempt previously , example screen chest x-rays sputum cytology , however , approach prove beneficial , current detection method sensitive enough identify early , non-phenotypic change . The proposal outline herein design clarify issue examine bronchial tissue patient risk development second cancer ( patient undergo primary resection cure bronchogenic lung cancer ) assess biopsy tissue presence chromosomal abnormality mutation h- k-ras protooncogenes . These change may present long period time airway epithelial cell prior development overt pathologic change , method recognize change would useful assess follow patient risk develop malignancy . Importance lymph node status lung cancer : In patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , tumor stage strong determinant prognosis . Stratification patient stag facilitates individual treatment decision base survival statistic population . Within staged population however , subset patient apparent early disease still suffer cancer recurrence . This due inability current stag method detect small number disseminate tumor cell ( micrometastases ) patient . Reverse transcription-PCR ( RT-PCR ) cancer relate messenger RNA 's show detect presence micrometastases histologically negative lymph node specimen , finding correlate poor outcome . Unfortunately , routine clinical application technique limit `` false positive '' result control tissue low specificity predict disease recurrence . We recently show quantitative RT-PCR ( QRT-PCR ) discriminate true false positive , result improve ability predict recurrence . In proposal intend analyze lymph node patient undergo surgical resection NSCLC use quantitative RT-PCR . These patient follow five year determine tumor recurrence . The goal use QRT-PCR try identify patient high risk disease recurrence may therefore benefit aggressive therapy . Specific Aims 1 . To obtain maintain cell culture 'normal ' bronchial epithelial cell ( NBECs ) tumor patient undergo resection cure bronchogenic non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) mesothelioma . 2 . To harvest NBEC lung tumor evaluation genetic abnormality . 3 . To perform polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification DNA harvest NBECs , tumor , adjacent normal lung white blood cell control evaluation mutation K-ras p53 protooncogenes , well candidate lung cancer gene . In addition , look mutation alteration expression Fas , Fas ligand , FADD , three molecule mediate program cell death recently show expressed multiple tumor cell include lung cancer . 4 . To analyze cytokine present lavage fluid , tumor , lung tissue . 5 . To produce T cell culture cell present tumor-draining lymph node tumor tissue . 6 . To analyze intra-pulmonary mediastinal lymph node expression tumor relate mRNA 's ( carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , cytokeratin-19 , hepatocyte growth factor , gastrin-releasing peptide ( GRP ) receptor , neuromedin-B ( NMB ) receptor ) potential evidence micrometastases . 7 . To detect metastatic tumor bone marrow extract discarded rib resection material . Significance Several researcher already establish chromosomal change occur non-random pattern non-small cell lung cancer . It appear change correlate specific genetic change , result malignant phenotype . Furthermore , great deal experimental evidence support multistage theory carcinogenesis , whereby incremental change genome accumulate , result malignant phenotype . The final product accumulate change determine cell origin number severity change occur . We hope establish early change ( express karyotypic change particular point mutation ) identify would indicate likelihood particular patient develop another malignancy . This information could apply clinical situation , example , determine frequency clinical follow-up chest x-ray , screen bronchoscopy , sputum cytology . Furthermore , information gather could help identify one genetic change necessary transformation , could explore define transformation process . The presence malignant cell lymph node critical parameter stag lung cancer patient . Assessment lymph node currently do histopathology alone . The long-term survival lung cancer patient Stage IB disease ( know lymph node involvement tumor great 2 cm ) low patient Stage IA ( know lymph node involvement tumor le 2 cm ) . Likewise , survival rate patient judge Stage II base histologically positive level one lymph node often better high stage patient level two lymph node involvement . These observation suggest micrometastases often present lymph node detectable histological assessment . This proposal supplement histopathological examination lymph node method detect occult metastatic cell determine whether assign patient high stage accurately reflect disease burden . This could affect subsequent treatment patient outcome .</detailed_description>
