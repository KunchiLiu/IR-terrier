	<brief_summary>Exploiting immunostimulatory capacity dendritic cell hold great promise cancer immunotherapy . A mouse model malignant mesothelioma allow u prove autologous dendritic cell present tumor antigen effective ( partly ) inhibit tumor growth . This study test feasibility safety clinical trial use autologous DC therapeutic adjuvant treatment malignant pleural mesothelioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dendritic Cell-based Immunotherapy Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For phase I study , patient end-stage malignant mesothelioma deem fit enough treated chemotherapy ask participate study . Patients first treat 4 course chemotherapy ( standard treatment [ Alimta/cisplatin ] ) . After chemotherapy leukapherese perform monocyte use differentiation dendritic cell . The procedure grow dendritic cell vitro ( culture ) pulse tumor lysate perform cleanroom environment . Several quality control test perform dendritic cell ready re-injection . Three dos properly pulse autologous dendritic cell re-injected every two week . Using proper procedure mesothelioma patient , minor side effect expect . Ten ( 10 ) patient treated procedure define safety toxicity immunization observe ( anti-tumor ) immune response .</detailed_description>

Positive delayed type hypersensitivity skin test ( induration &gt; 2mm 48hrs ) least one positive control antigen MULTITEST CMI ( Pasteur merieux ) . Stable disease response chemotherapy . Availability sufficient tumor material patient . Ability return Erasmus MC adequate followup require protocol . Conditions make patient unfit chemotherapy progressive disease 4 cycle chemotherapy . Pleurodesis affect side pleural fluid obtain . Medical psychological impediment probable compliance protocol . Patients steroid ( immunosuppressive agent ) exclude basis potential immune suppression . Patients must 6 week discontinuation must stop treatment time study . No prior malignancy allow except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , superficial insitu cancer bladder cancer patient diseasefree five year . Serious concomitant disease , active infection . Patients history autoimmune disease organ allograft , active acute chronic infection , include HIV viral hepatitis . Patients serious intercurrent chronic acute illness pulmonary ( asthma COPD ) cardiac ( NYHA class III IV ) hepatic disease illness consider study coordinator constitute unwarranted high risk investigational DC treatment . Patients know allergy shell fish ( contains KLH ) . Pregnant lactating woman . Patients inadequate peripheral vein access perform leukapheresis Concomitant participation another clinical trial An organic brain syndrome significant psychiatric abnormality would comprise ability give inform consent , preclude participation full protocol followup . Absence assurance compliance protocol . Lack availability followup assessment .</criteria>
