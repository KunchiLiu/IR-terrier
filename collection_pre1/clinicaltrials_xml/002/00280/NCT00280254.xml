	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two strategy treatment outpatient heart failure . We hypothesize individualized treatment strategy base availability hemodynamic data non-invasive testing would feasible significantly reduce morbidity compare conventional clinically orient treatment heart failure outpatient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Hemodynamically Oriented Echocardiography-Based Strategy Treatment Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical strategy aim achieve optimal hemodynamic profile advocate management congestive heart failure . Non-invasive estimate , base echocardiographic evaluation , might identify outpatient could benefit additional pharmacological therapy . Based assumption conduct single-center , prospective , randomize , open-label , blind endpoint evaluation clinical trial compare echocardiography-guided strategy aim achieve near-normal hemodynamic profile conventional clinically-oriented strategy congestive heart failure management . Echocardiography-guided strategy . Patients allocate echocardiography-guided strategy underwent sequential cardiac ultrasound examination evaluate hemodynamic-derived parameter . M-mode two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography perform experienced cardiologist use commercially available ultrasound equipment ( ATL HDI 5000 , Bothel , WA , USA ) . Echocardiographic parameter evaluate accord standard recommendation American Society Echocardiography . For measurement , 3-5 consecutive cardiac cycle measure average . Hemodynamic parameter determine accord previously validate protocol . In brief , pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimate sum estimate right atrial pressure pressure gradient right ventricle right atria . Right atrial pressure estimate measure inferior vena cava diameter degree collapsibility inspiration . Cardiac output determine multiplying heart rate leave ventricular systolic volume . Left ventricular systolic volume estimate multiply time-velocity integral leave ventricular outflow estimate leave ventricular outflow area . Systemic vascular resistance calculate use standard hemodynamic formula , incorporate cardiac output mean arterial pressure estimation . Systemic vascular resistance cardiac output index body surface area . Each patient assign echocardiography-guided strategy underwent three consecutive echocardiogram separate four-week period final echocardiogram 6 month . Following test , patient reevaluate physician heart failure team . Pharmacological therapy guide accord pre-defined protocol base hemodynamic estimate . Firstly , whenever elevate right-sided filling pressure detect loop diuretic therapy incremented irrespective presence clinical sign symptom pulmonary and/or systemic congestion . Afterwards , whenever raise systemic vascular resistance identify , additional vasodilator therapy incorporate optimized , long systolic arterial pressure equal great 90 mmHg . Clinically-guided strategy . Therapeutic decision patient assign conventional treatment base recommendation international clinical practice guideline . Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor beta-blockers use optimization encourage . Standard non-pharmacological counseling also provide CHF train nurse first month follow-up . Diuretic therapy exclusively base presence intensity clinical finding suggestive pulmonary and/or systemic congestion . Clinically oriented patient also underwent baseline final echocardiogram , decision-making team unaware data throughout protocol .</detailed_description>
