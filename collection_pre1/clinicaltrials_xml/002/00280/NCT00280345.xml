	<brief_summary>Based recent observation find new animal model pigmentary glaucoma DBA/2J mouse , propose immune system abnormality anterior chamber may play possible role development pigmentary glaucoma possibly primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) human .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim establish , tissue aqueous analysis patient pigmentary glaucoma , POAG normal control , marker anterior chamber autoimmune dysfunction occur significantly different amount patient condition compare normal control . We also attempt establish , proven methodology tissue gene expression , source difference marker , notably PEDF IL-18 , uveal tissue anterior chamber , importantly iris possibly trabecular meshwork well . The actual etiology cellular level elevate intraocular pressure development pigmentary glaucoma well understood human . If anterior chamber immune dysfunction show important factor development disease human , apparently demonstrate DBA/2J mouse , would lead important area investigation possible novel approach treat prevent disease human . We hypothesize patient pigmentary glaucoma , amount PEDF aqueous significantly reduce IL-18 significantly elevate compare aqueous normal control . In patient POAG , hypothesize similar result PEDF , although significantly less reduction PEDF compare pigmentary glaucoma patient may interest find well . With regard IL-18 , possible amount would significantly elevate pigmentary glaucoma patient compare normal control POAG patient . In view result DBA/2J mouse model , hope determine whether expression PEDF could regulate iris and/or trabecular meshwork pigmentary glaucoma patient compare POAG patient whether IL-18 expression tissue could regulate pigmentary glaucoma patient compare POAG patient . Such finding would strongly suggest anterior chamber immune abnormality play role etiology pigmentary glaucoma human . It already suggest decreased amount expression PEDF find patient glaucoma neurodegenerative disease eye . However , source decrease expression identify . If IL-18 production elevate pigmentary glaucoma regulate anterior chamber structure eye human patient disease , also would highly suggestive localized anterior chamber immune dysfunction play role development disease . Depending finding , additional investigation autoimmune dysregulation pigmentary glaucoma ( perhaps secondary glaucoma ) may help determine predictive value marker identify whether patient pigment dispersion syndrome develop glaucomatous damage .</detailed_description>
