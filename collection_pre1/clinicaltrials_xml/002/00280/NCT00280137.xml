	<brief_summary>To examine psychometric property brief quality life ( QOL ) instrument use pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . The purpose prospective study primarily determine validity reliability new health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) measure child systemic lupus erythematous ( SLE ) . We wish secondarily examine concordance child- parent-reports HRQOL measure identify factor associate poor HRQOL . Earlier study show SLE significantly impact QOL adult . At present , disease-specific instrument measure HRQOL child SLE . In response concern , develop `` Simple Measure Impact Lupus Erythematosus Youngsters© ( SMILEY© ) . Establishing validity reliability SMILEY© , examine child-parent agreement identify factor associate poor HRQOL enable u measure impact SLE child , formulate appropriate intervention sensitive population . We plan follow specific aim : 1. determine construct validity reliability SMILEY© child parent version child SLE use gold standard ( Pediatric Quality Life inventory - PedsQL generic rheumatology module , Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire -CHAQ ) 2. determine responsiveness SMILEY© 3. examine level agreement child- parent-reports SMILEY© child SLE 4. identify medical ( steroid use , use disease modify agent cytoxan , cellcept , thalidomide , cyclosporine , disease duration , disease activity disease damage etc . ) psychosocial ( self-concept , socioeconomic status ) factor affect HRQOL ( measure child- parent-reports SMILEY© PedsQL generic rheumatology module ) physical function 5 ) translate , adapt validate SMILEY different language</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pediatric lupus chronic multisystem rheumatic disease , associate significant medical psychosocial implication . Frequent physician visit routine , urgent emergent care , limitation activity , medication side effect , change body image , fear future , miss school disruptive patient parent impact spheres life . There lupus-specific questionnaire design measure well-being child disease . We develop brief questionnaire , `` Simple Measure Impact Lupus Erythematosus Youngsters© ( SMILEY© ) child parent version . We conduct research children/parents feel having/their child lupus use response modify preliminary SMILEY© . After several iteration , SMILEY 26 question develop parallel child- parent-versions response form 5 faces-scale denote different expression , order ensure easy comprehension across different age culture . During visit , information lupus collect child parent , ask complete SMILEY© questionnaire measure quality life , physical function , self-esteem behavior . They give additional copy SMILEY© , ask complete within 10 day initial evaluation return mail ( self-addressed , stamp envelope provide ) . Then child legal guardian ask complete questionnaire include SMILEY© subsequent visit least every 3-6 month interval earlier change disease activity determine physician . Medication use , disease activity disease severity assessment make physician initial subsequent evaluation . We determine psychometrics property SMILEY responsiveness change disease activity . Both national international site include study . SMILEY addition translate adapated different language subsequently validate . This study provide valuable information impact lupus overall well-being . Being brief , valid , reliable easy administer instrument , SMILEY© would suitable use across different age group , languages culture . SMILEY© use important clinical outcome tool clinical research arena , thus enable u formulate appropriate intervention .</detailed_description>
