	<brief_summary>Patients enrol study diagnose non-small cell lung cancer remove operation . The standard treatment disease combination chemotherapy radiation therapy ; however , best way combine treatment know . This study examine combination chemotherapy radiotherapy increase effect slow tumor growth addition drug call ZD1839 . In study , chemotherapy give initially ( induction therapy ) try control spread cancer . Then radiation chemotherapy give together . Receiving chemotherapy time radiation treatment enhance effect radiation . In study , patient receive drug call ZD1839 . In laboratory test cancer cell , ZD1839 show additive effect use combination radiation . ZD1839 also show slow stop growth tumor . The purpose study determine side effect effectiveness use ZD1839 use radiation treatment regimen ( induction chemotherapy follow combination chemotherapy , ZD1839 , radiation therapy ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy Using Paclitaxel , Carboplatin , CPT-11 With Pegfilgrastim</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer remain leading cause cancer-related mortality United States . In 2002 , approximately 170,000 new case lung cancer diagnose , approximately 160,000 death occur . Eighty percent case lung cancer non-small cell type , 30 35 % Stage IIIA/B consider potentially curable . The standard care United States patient unresectable Stage IIIA/B good performance status ( PS ) combination systemic chemotherapy thoracic radiation therapy ( TRT ) . What clear management patient optimal strategy employ combined-modality approach , well optimal chemotherapy radiation therapy dose schedule . Induction Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy Stage IIIA/B NSCLC The use combine modality become standard care unresectable Stage IIIA/B non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . In curative approach disease , local control eradication occult micrometastatic disease must achieve . Combined-modality trial employ induction chemotherapy suggest reduction rate metastatic disease , suggest effectively deliver chemotherapy eradicate occult micrometastatic disease . All trial cite show improved survival combined-modality arm . Combined-modality trial employ concurrent chemoradiation suggest improved loco-regional control result improve survival . These data suggest induction concurrent treatment may important may exert benefit different manner : induction therapy effective chemotherapy reduces rate overt metastatic disease , concurrent treatment improve local control enhance local effect TRT . Four trial date publish address sequential versus concurrent therapy . In trial , concurrent treatment yield improved survival sequential approach . The value either induction consolidation therapy addition concurrent chemotherapy currently address randomized Phase III trial . The study evaluate incorporation ZD1839 concurrent CP TCRT dose 74 Gy follow 2 cycle induction CIP . The primary objective define toxicity profile approach . With amendment 2 , patient longer receive maintenance ZD1839 . Given data generate LCCC 9603 2001 , `` hybrid '' platform induction CIP follow concurrent TCRT ( 74 Gy ) CP seem appropriate incorporation ZD1839 general tolerance therapy good PS , unresectable , Stage III NSCLC subject . Given esophagitis primary toxicity see approach , stop rule place excessive esophageal toxicity .</detailed_description>
