	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine patient corticosteroids give memantine show improvement memory compare receive placebo ( inactive substance ) . This research also seek determine patient , give memantine , experience improvement manic/hypomanic symptom ( feeling agitation , overexcitement , hyperactivity ) and/or depressive symptom . Subjects randomize crossover trial memantine placebo 8 week , follow 4 week washout 8 week study medication . Memantine placebo start 5 mg/day one week , increase 5 mg twice day second week . During third week patient take 10 mg morning 5 mg evening . At week 4-8 , patient take 10 mg twice day . One 8 week course study medication memantine 8 week course study medication placebo , assign random fashion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty ( 20 ) outpatient pulmonary ( e.g . asthma ) , rheumatic ( e.g . rheumatoid arthritis , dermatomyositis ) illnesses renal transplant ( population use prior clinical trial ) receive course prednisone corticosteroid least 12 week enrol . To participate , patient must age 18 70 take least 5 mg/day prednisone , prednisone equivalent , least 3 month expectation continue treatment dose least 20 additional week . At baseline , research assistant study doctor ask patient health , prior corticosteroid therapy medication patient may take health problem , medication allergy , surgical procedure cognitive impairment may . Patients memory test answer question mood , sleep , appetite , daily activity . The subject randomize crossover trial memantine placebo 8 week follow 4 week washout 8 week study drug . Memantine start 5 mg/day 1 week , increase 5 mg BID second week , 10 mg QAM 5 mg QHS next week 10 mg BID week 4-8 directed package insert . One 8 week course memantine placebo assign random fashion . Measures memory compare within subject baseline , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 ( begin second course study drug ) , week 16 week 20 ( exit ) . At week 2 14 , participant give 3 questionnaire measure mood ; medication management conduct assessment . Each visit , include baseline , take approximately one half hour . Detailed Experimental : Baseline measure mood assessed Activation subscale Internal State Scale ( ISS ) ( primary measure ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( 17-item version ) , Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) . Cognition assess HVLT-R ( primary measure ) , STROOP color word task . The subject give memantine identical appear placebo describe . Reductions dosage allow clinically significant side effect emerge base judgment blind psychiatrist . The cognitive measure administer assessment visit ( 8 total ) ; assessment week 2 week 14 patient also give 3 mood questionnaire . Each visit approximately hour half length . The RA assessment blind time . Alternative equivalent version HVLT-R give minimize practice learn effect . Current cumulative corticosteroid dose ( mg day X number day ) determine record . In case miss data use last observation carry forward . In lamotrigine study similar population , find change total word recall word list Stroop . Assuming similar change memantine use double-sided , paired t-tests , could detect difference change placebo group participants HVLT-R participant STROOP . Thus , although primarily pilot study obtain effect size future , large trial fund NIH , power detect clinically meaningful difference medication placebo .</detailed_description>
