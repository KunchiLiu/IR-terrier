	<brief_summary>The purpose ongoing study ( Part II ) estimate incidence acute rheumatic fever , rheumatic heart disease , acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis ( kidney disease ) , invasive group A streptococcal ( GAS ) disease ( strep infection ) Fiji help develop good treatment vaccine . Group A streptococcal disease cause bacterium group A streptococcus . It commonly find nose throat normal healthy adult child , cause illness . The bacterium spread close contact patient carrier , thing like cough , sneeze , kiss , share drink cause wide variety illness . These illness may sore throat , skin sore , less commonly acute rheumatic fever kidney disease . Participants age recruit Colonial War Memorial Lautoka Hospital . A blood sample collect study participant . Subject participation less one day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study prospective active surveillance study group A streptococcal ( GAS ) diseases across two hospital site design estimate local incidence acute rheumatic fever ( ARF ) , rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) , acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis ( APSGN ) invasive GAS disease . It part II series 5 study include DMID protocols 05-0081 , 05-0117 , 05-0118 , 06-0081 . The study also design assess clinical feature GAS disease . The study also provide detailed information molecular epidemiology GAS diseases . The study establish active surveillance system case ARF APSGN invasive GAS disease Colonial War Hospital , Suva Fiji Lautoka Hospital , Lautoka . In addition , study establish active surveillance system patient present complication establish RHD Colonial War Memorial Hospital Suva Fiji . The primary objective study estimate incidence : acute rheumatic fever Western Central division Fiji child 3-17 year age adult 18-40 year ; RHD age Central division Fiji ; APSGN Western Central division Fiji child 0-17 year age ; invasive GAS disease Western Central division Fiji age . The secondary objective study : describe clinical feature patient present complication establish RHD central division Fiji ; establish ongoing surveillance system GAS diseases Western Central division ; describe clinical feature patient present ARF , APSGN invasive GAS disease Fiji ; genotypically characterize GAS isolate patient ARF , APSGN invasive GAS disease Fiji ; measure anti-J8 antibody patient GAS disease . The primary endpoint study determine incidence : confirm probable ARF , first presentation recurrent case ; RHD age Central division Fiji ; confirm probable APSGN ; confirm probable invasive GAS disease . The secondary endpoint study include : incidence heart failure , atrial fibrillation , stroke infective endocarditis patient RHD present Colonial War Memorial Hospital ; distribution symptom sign ARF patient present hospital ARF ; distribution sit infection case invasive GAS disease ; incidence necrotizing fasciitis streptococcal toxic shock syndrome ; proportion GAS isolate patient ARF , APSGN invasive GAS disease contain J8 epitope overall emm-type distribution GAS isolate ; characterization GAS isolate ( C repeat region sequence emm-typing ) ; measurement anti-J8 antibody patient GAS disease .</detailed_description>
