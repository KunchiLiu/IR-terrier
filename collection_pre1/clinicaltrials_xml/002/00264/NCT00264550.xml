	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Golimumab Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Methotrexate Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( treatment assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient aware receive treatment ) , placebo-controlled study multiple subcutaneous ( SC ) administration golimumab 2 dos monotherapy combination MTX patient active RA despite treatment MTX . The duration participation study individual patient upto 268 week . The patient randomly assign 3:3:2:2 ratio receive golimumab 50 mg 100 mg placebo injection skin every 4 week week 20 methotrexate placebo capsule give addition . At Week 24 , subject receive golimumab 50mg 100mg injection , golimumab continue group 4 half year . At Week 16 patient study meet criteria &lt; 20 % improvement baseline swell tender joint count enter early escape double-blinded fashion . Treatment long-term extension start Week 52 continue every 4 week thereafter total approximately 5 year initial ( Week 0 ) administration study agent . Patients return schedule follow-up visit generally every 12 week total length follow-up approximately 5 year first administration study drug .</detailed_description>
