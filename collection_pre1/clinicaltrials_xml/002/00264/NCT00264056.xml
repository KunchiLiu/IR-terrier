	<brief_summary>The incidence malignant melanoma continue rise throughout world . Approximately 12 100,000 Germans diagnose malignant melanoma per year . Malignant melanoma often aggressive since may spread lymphatic system bloodstream early stage disease . While treatment localized disease mostly surgical , patient extensive disease , prognosis remain poor ; primary standard therapy metastastic disease comprise dacarbazine ( DTIC ) eventually combine chemotherapeutic agent e.g. , cisplatin BCNU . The duration response systemic chemotherapy generally short far , standard second-line treatment establish . To study potential additional therapeutic effect regional hyperthermia advance malignant melanoma patient progressive chemotherapy refractory soft tissue metastasis , present trial , seek compine local hyperthermia concomitant systemic second-line chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
