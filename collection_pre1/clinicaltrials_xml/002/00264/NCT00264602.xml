	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine identify first lymph node drain tumor , thus would likely site metastatic disease , remove analysis improve ability detect tumor node remove additional site potentially contain tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real-Time Image Guided Lymphatic Mapping Nodal Targeting Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This study design determine feasibility , safety amd dose indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescent light order maximize near infrared-guided detection tumor-specific sentinel lymph node routine surgery early stage lung cancer tumor nearby lymph node remove . - At time surgery , indocyanine dye inject around patient 's tumor . We use dose approximately 10,000 time low previously approve injection blood . After minute , surgeon remove lymph node near tumor , standard lung surgery , look lymph node near-infrared fluorescence . - The `` filtered '' near-infrared light cause indocyanine green dye fluoresce surgeon identify lymph node likely contain tumor cell . If lymph node find group node usually remove , use near-infrared light look near tumor sentinel lymph node guide surgeon sentinel node remove study . The surgeon continue operation remove tumor . The lymph node process special analysis tailor finding metastasis sentinel lymph node . - Since first question study determine small dose indocyanine green use safely near-infrared detection lymph node , subject receive dose . The person receive 1/3 teaspoon . - A five year observation period begin follow operation surgeon physician examine patient order certain study look evidence regrowth tumor .</detailed_description>
