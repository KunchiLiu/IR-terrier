	<brief_summary>The Frequent Hemodialysis Network ( FHN ) Daily Trial randomize control trial recruiting subject dialysis unit associate designated Clinical Centers U.S. Canada follow 1 year . Subjects randomize either conventional hemodialysis Daily HD deliver least 2.5 hour ( typically 3 4 hour ) , 3 day per week , frequent hemodialysis deliver 1.5 - 2.75 hour , 6 day per week . The study two co-primary outcome : 1 ) composite mortality change 12 month leave ventricular mass magnetic resonance imaging , 2 ) composite mortality change 12 month SF-36 RAND physical health composite ( PHC ) quality life scale .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frequent Hemodialysis Network : Daily Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial randomize control trial recruiting subject dialysis unit associate designated Clinical Centers U.S. Canada . A total 250 ESRD patient receive in-center HD randomize continue conventional HD , 3 day per week ( control group ) , switch daily HD , 6 day per week ( intervention group ) . Subjects treat follow 12 month . Two co-primary outcome designate : 1 ) composite mortality change 12 month leave ventricular mass , 2 ) composite mortality change 12 month SF-36 RAND physical health composite . In addition , main secondary outcome designate seven outcome domain : 1 ) cardiovascular structure function ( change LV mass ) , 2 ) health-related quality life/physical function ( change PHC ) , 3 ) depression/burden illness ( change Beck Depression Inventory ) , 4 ) nutrition ( change serum albumin ) , 5 ) cognitive function ( change Trail Making Test B ) , 6 ) mineral metabolism ( change average predialysis serum phosphorus ) , 7 ) clinical event ( rate non-access hospitalization death ) . Hypertension anemia also main outcome domain , without designation single first priority outcomes . The objective study follow : Feasibility : 1 . To determine feasibility recruit retain patient randomized trial six time per week in-center daily HD versus conventional three time per week in-center HD . 2 . To determine patient adherence acceptance in-center daily HD , identify reason discontinuation nonadherence therapy . Safety : 3 . To determine safety in-center daily HD particular focus vascular access event participant burden . Efficacy : 4 . To evaluate efficacy in-center daily HD compare conventional three time per week HD two co-primary outcome : ) composite mortality change 12 month leave ventricular mass magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , ii ) composite mortality change 12 month SF-36 RAND physical health composite score ( PHC ) . 5 . To determine effect in-center daily HD nine secondary outcome domain : ) cardiovascular structure function , ii ) health-related quality life physical function , iii ) depression/burden illness , iv ) nutrition inflammation , v ) cognitive function , vi ) mineral metabolism , vii ) clinical event , viii ) hypertension , ix ) anemia . Characterization Intervention 6 . To good understand complex therapy in-center daily HD , evaluate solute clearance , treatment time , volume removal , non-dialytic factor difference frequency medical surveillance treatment . Implementation : 7 . To determine feasibility implement in-center daily HD practice , evaluate barrier implementation incremental cost daily HD compare 3 time per week conventional HD .</detailed_description>
