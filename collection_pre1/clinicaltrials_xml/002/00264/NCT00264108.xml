The study intend collect information normal medical practice routine anemia management perform participate center . This observational , non-randomized , prospective , comparative , parallel-group survey perform The Netherlands . Patients various severity disease may enter survey soon either epoetin alfa darbepoetin alfa treatment start follow end epoetin alfa/darbepoetin alfa treatment . Patient data collect , average , monthly ( depend treatment receive ) continue 4 week end treatment epoetin alfa darbepoetin alfa . An assessment cost-effectiveness make treatment . The assessment cost-effectiveness base following : cancer type status , chemotherapy anti-cancer treatment , hemoglobin level , use either epoetin alfa darbepoetin alfa , use blood transfusion , serum iron level iron supplementation . Safety evaluation include incidence serious non-serious adverse event . Because study involve collection information , treatment require Sponsor medication supply Sponsor . Epoetin alpha darbepoetin alpha administer accord routine clinical practice .</detailed_description>
