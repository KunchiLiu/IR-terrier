	<brief_title>Arterial Closure v Direct Compression Hemostasis After PCI - The ACDC Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) common procedure perform obstructive coronary artery disease one million procedure perform annually United States alone1 . Despite major advance technology operative expertise , optimum management arterial access site PCI procedures remain unclear . The conventional practice arterial access site management involve delay sheath removal several hour allow normalization heparin induced anticoagulation . This delayed sheath removal pose risk recurrent bleed hematoma formation . Furthermore , delay sheath removal result decrease patient mobility , increase patient discomfort require frequent monitor impact nursing resource . The risk associate delayed sheath removal may increase concomitant administration potent anti platelet therapy routinely use patient undergoing PCI2 . Arterial puncture closure device ( APCD ) develop obtain immediate arterial access site hemostasis close vascular procedure aim towards early patient mobilization . Although efficacy APCD document several small study limit information available regard safety diverse patient population . A recent meta analysis show increase vascular complication rate associate use device bring safety routine use question3 . Due lack definitive data , arterial access site management vary considerably physician among institution . APCD routinely use centers4 others continue delay arterial sheath removal several hour procedure5 . Immediate sheath removal follow direct compression though routinely practice coronary angiographic procedure use PCI procedure due intra procedural administration heparin result prolonged anticoagulation . Reversal heparin protamine may allow immediate sheath removal result early patient ambulation decrease access site vascular complication . The safety efficacy intravenous protamine administration reversal heparin well establish routine use cardiovascular surgery several decades6 recent report show safety efficacy method early sheath removal PCI procedures7-9 . The propose study design evaluate safety efficacy immediate sheath removal follow direct compression compare use APCD achieve hemostasis PCI .</detailed_description>
