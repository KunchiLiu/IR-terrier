Comparisons make control group subject smoke usual normal nicotine yield cigarette . There one year follow-up phase subject monitor free resume smoke commercial cigarette choice , quit . We hypothesize smoker cigarette progressively reduce nicotine content experience reduction nicotine intake without compensatory oversmoking . This serve `` wean '' nicotine result decrease level nicotine dependence . Once occur , subject able maintain reduce level nicotine intake 6 month continue smoke low level RNC cigarette . When free choose smoke behavior ( follow-up phase ) , result period lower dependence smoke few cigarette and/or great interest quit compare control group , whose level nicotine dependence hypothesize sustain throughout . Primary Hypotheses : 1 . Nicotine intake low RNC group control group . 2 . Exposure tobacco smoke gas phase constituent similar RNC control group . 3 . Exposure tobacco smoke tar constituent similar RNC control group . 4 . Cardiovascular biomarkers inflammation , platelet activation , endothelial dysfunction , HDL cholesterol lower RNC group control group . 5 . Cigarette consumption , measure cigarettes-per-day ( CPD ) , low RNC group control group . Secondary hypothesis : 1 . Over course taper maintenance follow-up , interest quit high RNC group compare control group . 2 .
