	<brief_summary>In patient Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) , disease cause nonsense mutation ( premature stop codon ) gene make dystrophin protein . PTC124 show partially restore dystrophin production animal DMD due nonsense mutation . The main purpose study understand whether PTC124 safely increase functional dystrophin protein muscle patient DMD due nonsense mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study PTC124 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , patient DMD due nonsense mutation treat new investigational drug call PTC124 . To determine patient qualifies study evaluation procedure perform within 21 day prior start treatment ; procedure include : history , physical examination , blood urine test assess organ function , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , muscle biopsy evaluation dystrophin protein , DMD-specific test muscle function ( patient able perform test ) . Eligible patient elect enroll study participate 28-day treatment period 28-day follow-up period ( 56 day total ) . The first 6 patient enrol take PTC124 treatment 3 time per day meal 28 day dose 4 mg/kg ( breakfast ) , 4 mg/kg ( lunch ) 8 mg/kg ( dinner ) ; patient observe 28-day follow-up period without treatment . Next , 18 additional patient enrol take PTC124 treatment 3 time per day meal 28 day dose 10 mg/kg ( breakfast ) , 10 mg/kg ( lunch ) , 20 mg/kg ( dinner ) ; patient observe 28-day follow-up period without treatment . Subsequently , 6-12 additional patient enrol take PTC124 treatment 3 time per day meal 28 day dose 20 mg/kg ( breakfast ) , 20 mg/kg ( lunch ) , 40 mg/kg ( dinner ) ; patient observe 28-day follow-up period without treatment . There 2-night stay clinical research center begin end 28 day PTC124 treatment . To assess efficacy , patient end-of-treatment biopsy undergo DMD-specific test muscle function ( patient able perform test ) . To assess safety pharmacokinetics , safety assessment , blood urine test , ECGs perform prespecified timepoints 28-day treatment period 28-day follow-up period . At end 56 day , patient assess periodically regard general health status ; evaluation perform telephone contact approximately 6-month interval first 2 year approximately 12-month interval subsequent year ( 5 year total ) .</detailed_description>
