	<brief_summary>Inflammation characterise increase risk cardiovascular event . Dysfunction vascular endothelium cause oxidative stress might provide mechanistic link . In acute chronic inflammation , oxidative stress occur production reactive oxygen specie [ ROS ] ( include superoxide anion [ O2- ] ) exceed capacity endogenous antioxidant defense system , result ROS-mediated damage . Recombinant human superoxide dismutase ( rhSOD ) show potent antioxidant property in-vitro animal study test phase I clinical trial human . rhSOD could offer therapeutic option vascular dysfunction disease associate increased oxidative stress . The investigator , therefore , want test hyporesponsiveness vasoactive drug ( norepinephrine , acetylcholine glyceroltrinitrate ) acute inflammation low-dose lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) due increase production superoxide anion , could scavanged radical scavenger rhSOD .</brief_summary>
