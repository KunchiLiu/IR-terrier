	<detailed_description>NeuroPace , Inc. sponsor investigational device study RNS® System , first close loop responsive brain stimulator design treat refractory epilepsy . The RNS® System Pivotal study multi-center , randomize , double-blinded , sham-stimulation control investigation conduct 32 epilepsy center throughout United States . The study design assess safety demonstrate RNS® System effective reduce frequency medically uncontrolled disable partial onset seizure start one two area brain . The RNS® Neurostimulator ( pacemaker-like device ) NeuroPace® Leads ( tiny wire electrode ) implant head . The Neurostimulator battery power , microprocessor control device detects store record electrographic pattern ( epileptiform , seizure-like , activity ) Leads within brain . When device detects electrographic pattern , respond send electrical stimulation Leads small part patient 's brain interrupt electrographic pattern . This type treatment call responsive stimulation , yet know work treatment epilepsy . Direct brain stimulation therapy already receive approval United States , Europe , Canada , Australia treatment Essential Tremor Parkinson 's disease . Direct brain stimulation approve treatment epilepsy . Subjects participate RNS® System Pivotal study must meet inclusion criterion , include localization epileptogenic region ( ) , prior enrol study . Throughout entire study , subject caregiver must keep seizure diary . Seizure frequency , seizure severity , antiepileptic medication , well physical emotional health monitor record throughout study . Upon demonstrate required seizure frequency stable antiepileptic medication 3 consecutive month Baseline ( pre-implant ) Period , subject qualify RNS® System implantation . Antiepileptic medication continue remain stable 6 month post-implant . The surgical procedure perform within one month qualification . The RNS® Neurostimulator cranially implant connected one two NeuroPace® Leads implant brain . The investigational team determine placement Leads base prior localization epileptogenic region , accord standard localization procedure . Detection epileptiform activity enable subject 1 month Post-Operative Stabilization Period . Subjects randomize 1:1 either Treatment Sham group prior start 1 month Stimulation Optimization Period . During period subject see weekly basis Treatment Protocol investigator . Responsive stimulation enable optimized subject randomize Treatment group . Subjects randomized Sham group see simulate stimulation program order maintain treatment blind . The Blinded Evaluation Period comprise month 3 , 4 , 5 post-implant . Subjects Treatment group receive responsive stimulation subject Sham group . Subjects know whether responsive stimulation deliver . At end 5th month , subject ' transition Open Label Evaluation Period subject may receive responsive stimulation antiepileptic medication may adjust medically require . Subjects follow 2 year post-implant . Throughout study participation , effectiveness safety data monitor continuously , review document study investigator study appointment schedule every month first year post-implant , every 3 month .</detailed_description>
