	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial : 1 ) evaluate safety NONA-L-ARGININE ex vivo application saphenous vein segment prior grafting ; , 2 ) obtain preliminary data biological effect NONA-L-ARGININE , compare placebo , prevention neointimal hyperplasia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>LT-1951 aqueous solution NONA-L-ARGININE . The drug efficiently penetrate vascular tissue like saphenous vein supply tissue sustain reservoir L-arginine , substrate production nitric oxide . Nitric oxide ( NO ) important vasoactive cell signal compound implicate suppression neointimal hyperplasia . NO limit neointimal hyperplasia inhibit monocyte chemotaxis adherence , platelet adherence aggregation , vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation . A dramatic reduction neointimal hyperplasia follow treatment LT-1951 demonstrate preclinical vein artery interposition study several animal model . Marked improvement follow single ex vivo application LT-1951 interposition graft demonstrate beneficial effect drug dependent upon continued treatment graft tissue . In PATENT trial , saphenous vein graft harvest usual manner patient 's leg bath LT-1951 placebo ex vivo ( normal pressure temperature ) rinse implanted patient . Because LT-1951 apply graft , minimal systemic exposure risk patient . All patient study receive treatment NONA-L-ARGININE vehicle control . This within-patient , placebo-controlled , study double-blinded randomized . For patient , one comparable vein graft receive treatment placebo , receive treatment NONA-L-ARGININE . Any third vein graft use procedure treat per first vein graft , fourth vein graft treat per second vein graft . The first cohort 20 patient primary safety subgroup . This subgroup evaluate combination second cohort 30-80 patient assessment efficacy endpoint . During follow-up , patient clinical visit 6 week , include Computed Tomographic Angiography ( CTA ) . Patients undergo Intravascular Ultrasound-coronary angiography ( IVUS-angio ) 12 month optional CTA 6 , 12 24 month .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Subject must 3585 year age able give inform consent . 2 . Coronary artery disease require bypass graft use least two saphenous vein bypass graft carry median sternotomy utilize cardiopulmonary bypass . 3 . Use approve statin anticipate least 24 month surgery . 4 . Subject must candidate concurrent ventricular surgical restoration , AICD placement , valvular surgery . 5 . Agreeable CTA 6 week IVUS intervention 12months postCABG . Subjects agreeable additional CTA 6 , 12 24 month prefer . 1 . Acute traumatic injury vasculitis . 2 . Insulindependent diabetes . 3 . Procedure revision exist bypass graft . 4 . Procedure minimally invasive ( except harvest graft segment ) . 5 . Concurrent cardiac valvular surgery . 6 . Patients medical condition , investigator 's judgment , make patient ineligible place patient undue risk ( e.g . condition preclude standard invasive followup procedure IVUS angiography , i.e . renal failure , bleed diathesis , peripheral vascular disease prevent catheterization via groin ) . 7 . Subject clinical evidence infection Investigator deem significant completion procedure , could compromise subject 's safety . 8 . Subject recent history ( within past 6 month ) alcohol drug abuse . 9 . If female , subject pregnant try become pregnant . 10 . Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mls/min nondiabetics &lt; 50 mls/min noninsulin dependent diabetic .</criteria>
