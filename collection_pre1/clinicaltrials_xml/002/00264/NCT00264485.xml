	<brief_title>A Comparison Safety Effectiveness Two Forms Patient-controlled Pain Medication Used After Total Hip Replacement : The E-TRANS Fentanyl Transdermal System Versus Morphine Intravenous Pump</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare two pain medication deliver two different form patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) . PCA form pain management allow patient control amount pain medication receives . The PCA E-TRANS fentanyl system credit card-sized unit worn patient 's upper outer arm chest . It use low-intensity electrical current move fentanyl skin patient 's bloodstream . It require insertion intravenous ( IV ) needle , injection pain management . PCA IV morphine deliver vein IV infusion pump specially design control patient . The PCA E-TRANS fentanyl system deliver 40 microgram dose fentanyl PCA IV morphine delivers 1 milligram intravenous dose morphine . The patient study schedule total hip replacement one ( ) hip . Before surgery , patient teach use PCA device randomly assign receive either PCA IV morphine E-TRANS fentanyl . After undergo hip replacement , patient PCA device apply skin ( E-TRANS fentanyl ) IV insert vein ( PCA IV morphine ) , accord random assignment . The patient allow control delivery assign medication 72 hour . During first 24 hour , patient ask amount pain . The primary measure effectiveness successful pain relief ( define rating `` Excellent '' , `` Good '' ) 24-hour patient global assessment method pain control . At 24 , 48 , 72 hour , patient ask set specific question measure effectiveness PCA . In addition , patient 's doctor , nurse , physical therapist answer question PCA system . Safety assess monitor patient 's vital sign record adverse event , include problem location patient 's body PCA device apply insert . The objective establish Fentanyl HCl Patient-Controlled Transdermal System ( E-TRANS fentanyl ) effective intravenous ( IV ) PCA morphine control pain total hip replacement . E-TRANS fentanyl 40 mcg transdermally per patient-activated dose 10 minute , 6 dos per hour maximum 80 dose 24 hour ; Patient control intravenous morphine 1 mg dose , 10 dos per hour maximum 240 dose 24 hour . Study duration 72 hour .</detailed_description>
