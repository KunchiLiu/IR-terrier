	<brief_summary>The purpose research use recently develop triple-tracer positron emission tomography ( PET ) method study skeletal muscle insulin resistance . Insulin hormone make body control blood sugar level . `` Resistance ' insulin could cause poor blood glucose control ( blood sugar level higher normal ) . We want use new method image ( look ) follow three thing : 1 ) insulin affect blood flow skeletal muscle 2 ) insulin affect glucose ( sugar ) transport ( movement ) muscle , 3 ) insulin affect glucose metabolism ( breakdown ) skeletal muscle healthy individual . PET image relatively non-invasive way obtain `` metabolic picture '' body organ use successfully study brain , heart recently skeletal muscle . In research study , use PET , three radioactive tracer ( marker ) , study skeletal muscle glucose transport individual type 2 diabetes mellitus ( type 2 DM ) non-diabetic individual either normal weight overweight/obese</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal proposal use recently develop triple-tracer positron emission tomography ( PET ) method study skeletal muscle insulin resistance ( IR ) research volunteer type 2 diabetes mellitus ( type 2 DM ) comparison age gender-matched , normal weight non-diabetic volunteer , comparison age , gender , weight-matched overweight obese non-diabetic volunteer . We use three tracer obtain data respective insulin action upon tissue perfusion , glucose transport glucose phosphorylation order test hypothesis insulin resistance ( IR ) type 2 DM cause aggregation impairment step , thus challenge prevalent concept IR derive solitary impairment trans-membrane transport . Proximal step glucose transport phosphorylation consider contribute strongly pathogenesis IR obesity type 2 DM ( 1-5 ) . These scientific consideration might potential therapeutic implication . The overall goal project provide clarity separate respective role proximal step glucose metabolism . Glucose transport assess use 11C-3-O-methyl glucose ( half-life ~ 20 min ; also refer 3-0-MG ) , analog transport phosphorylated . 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose ( half-life ~ 109 min ; also refer FDG ) , use ass glucose transport glucose phosphorylation . The third tracer use , 15O-H2O , provide information tissue perfusion . The challenge use FDG study insulin action muscle derive data two biochemical step tissue activity pattern single tracer ; place high reliance upon model data . However , project , use three tracer difference metabolism two glucose analog , able address clear resolution respective role transport phosphorylation pathogenesis IR obesity type 2 DM .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>We recruit eight normal weight ( BMI 19 25 kg/m2 ) , eight overweight obese ( BMI 27 38 kg/m2 ) , nondiabetic , healthy volunteer , age 30 55 year old . For scientific reason crucial group age match . Limiting age range period 25 year help achieve goal . Volunteers two group must fast glucose &lt; 110 mg/dl ; HbA1c &lt; 6.0 % ; Hct &gt; 34 ; ALT &lt; 60 ; AST &lt; 60 ; Alk phos &lt; 150 ; sTSH &lt; 8 ; Trig &lt; 300 ; Chol &lt; 250 ; systolic BP &lt; 150 ; diastolic BP &lt; 95 ; good health . A medical history physical exam conduct nurse practitioner medical doctor . We also recruit eight volunteer type 2 DM ; large majority patient population overweight obese , inclusion criterion include BMI 27 38 kg/m2 , otherwise age gendermatched nondiabetic volunteer . At screening , HbA1c must less 8.5 % . For scientific purpose would like study volunteer type 2 DM without confound effect antidiabetic medication , therefore , propose restrict recruitment either treat diet exercise alone , oral agent sulfonylurea class , metformin , acarbose . We exclude volunteer take thiazolidinediones washout period class uncertain , exclude take insulin withdrawal likely would cause unacceptable level hyperglycemia . Research volunteer type 2 DM enrol study receive oral diabetic agent ( sulfonylurea , metformin acarbose ) , instruct withhold medication five day precede PET study . Previous difficulty lidocaine ( xylocaine ) exclusion . To eligible study , volunteer must free clinical evidence cardiac , renal , hepatic , vascular disease , major medical problem would endanger volunteer compromise scientific validity study . Subjects history myocardial infarction , proteinuria ( defined 1+ protein ) , alcohol drug abuse , malignancy neuromuscular disease exclude . Subjects gain lost 3 kg past 3 month exclude . Because PET , MR , DEXA scanning , premenopausal woman must negative pregnancy test within 24 hour prior procedure . To avoid radiation exposure infant , woman currently breastfeed permit participate research study . Subjects exclude contraindication MRI surgical vascular implant , pregnancy , pacemaker , claustrophobia . In subject questionable history metallic fragment , Xray suspect area body perform rule .</criteria>
