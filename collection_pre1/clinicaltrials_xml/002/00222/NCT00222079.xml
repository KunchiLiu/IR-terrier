	<brief_summary>The purpose research study measure acid reflux throat medical treatment people radiation therapy head neck treatment cancer . Many people receive head neck radiation therapy develop dry mouth result radiation damage saliva gland . In addition discomfort associate dry mouth , decrease saliva may increase severity gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( acid reflux ) . Acid reflux occur acid escape stomach throat . You may symptoms acid reflux , often cause symptom heartburn chest discomfort . Acid reflux treat diagnosed . Treatment consist dietary change , behavioral alteration , medication . Medications available decrease amount acid stomach . Diagnosis acid reflux make pH-probe test acid throat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Esomeprazole Treating Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) Head Neck Cancer Patients Exposed Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The annual incidence squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) 40,000 case per year US 60,000 case per year Europe . Radiation therapy employ combination chemotherapy primary treatment adjuvant therapy half patient SSCHN . A high incidence pathologic laryngopharyngeal reflux gastroesophageal reflux observe patient head neck cancer . When treatment cancer include radiation therapy , incidence 90 % report [ 2 ] . Although interplay acid reflux development head neck cancer remain unclear , strong argument radiation therapy worsen problem mute body 's ability neutralize acid . Radiation therapy extensively use treatment squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Radiation therapy work exploit survival differential malignant cell normal cell . Simply state , malignant cell likely die radiation compare normal non-malignant cell . However , normal cell respond equally normal tissue mark sensitivity radiation damage . Salivary gland one radiosensitive tissue permanently destroy external-beam radiotherapy . Damage salivary tissue radiation decrease ability excrete saliva . This support Olmos et al , use salivary scintigraphy irradiate non-irradiated patient find 84 % irradiated total partial disturbance baseline stimulate function . Of treated great 4500cGy , salivary excretion almost invariably impaired . Xerostomia term dry mouth , result loss . In addition volume saliva , content saliva also important . Helm et al . `` â€¦evaluated property human saliva relevant potential contribution esophageal acid clearance . '' By measure capacity acid neutralization plot titration curve , identify saliva especially bicarbonate content play important role neutralization esophageal acid rest lozenge-stimulated state . As saliva play active role neutralization esophageal acid clearance esophagus , loss saliva predict increase severity incidence reflux protective effect saliva 's ability clear neutralize acid reflux diminish . Korsten et al. , assessed effect chronic xerostomia parameter gastroesophageal reflux esophagitis report markedly impaired clearance acid esophagus abnormal 24-hour intra-esophageal pH study cohort male patient xerostomia . Medications available increase salivary flow often minimally effective poorly tolerate . Decreasing stomach acid production alternative method mitigate effect GERD patient . Esomeprazole proven beneficial treatment gastroesophageal reflux disease anticipate beneficial treating SCCHN patient treat external-beam radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
