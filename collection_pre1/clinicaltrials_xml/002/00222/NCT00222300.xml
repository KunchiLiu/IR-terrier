	<detailed_description>Total Hip Replacement ( THR ) common surgical procedure perform people hip osteoarthritis appear effective relieve pain improve function . However significant quadriceps atrophy weakness persist post-operatively . Although relief pain improvement function important outcome follow THR , weakness hip knee muscle reduce person 's ability manage stair , slope , public transport result persistent gait abnormality . Since low limb weakness one risk factor fall , important appropriately addressed . The study examines effect eight-week task-specific strengthen program low limb function patient follow THR randomize control trial . The experimental program conduct circuit gymnasium environment . Changes specific measure physical function patient Experimental Group compare patient Control Group continue standard care program provide Austin Health . Outcome measure include : low limb muscle strength use step test , pain , stiffness , function report WOMAC questionnaire , quality life use AQoL questionnaire , Timed Up-and-Go test . Walking test also conduct . These include : 1 . Walking pattern , record instrumented mat 2 . Walking endurance measure 6-minute walk test . 3 . Analysis hip joint torque use 3-D motion analysis .</detailed_description>
