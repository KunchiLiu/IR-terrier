	<brief_title>Tenecteplase Pulmonary Embolism Italian Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient major acute PE thrombolysis show life save ( 22 ) . Recent registry show beneficial effect thrombolysis also patient PE associate shock hypotension ( 4-23 ) . In patient thrombolytic treatment show obtain improvement 37 % lung perfusion , detect lung scan , respect improvement 18.8 % obtain heparin treatment ( 24 ) . In different trial , rt-PA result faster great improvement pulmonary artery hypertension heparin treatment ( 25 ) . Indeed , PE wide spectrum severity presentation conceivable use aggressive treatment reserve patient high risk adverse outcome . Hence , search start prognostic factor adverse outcome patient pulmonary embolism . RVD associate early adverse outcome ( PE recurrence mortality ) patient acute PE ( 26-28 ; 3 ) . In-hospital mortality PE patient without echocardiographic RVD find 18.4 % 5.7 % , respectively ( 3 ) . Ribeiro et al . find high mortality patient PE severe RVD : in-hospital mortality 7.9 % overall population respect 14.3 % patient severe RVD ( 5 ) . The ICOPER registry report 2-week mortality 15.9 % patient present RVD comparison 8 % patient without RVD ( 23 ) . In MAPPET 10 % patient RVD die within 30 day compare 4.1 % patient without ( 4 ) . RVD common finding patient acute PE normal blood pressure ( BP ) ( 29-33 ) . Recent data suggest patient objectively confirm PE , normal BP echocardiographic evidence RVD high incidence adverse outcome ( 7 ) may potentially benefit aggressive treatment ( 34-35 ) . In recent study patient acute PE classify accord presence RVD hypotension ; short-term mortality incidence PE-related shock patient normal BP echo RVD respectively 5 % 10 % . None patient normal BP RVD die experienced PE-related shock ( 6 ) . It recently demonstrate patient PE pulmonary hypertension RVD without arterial hypotension shock , rt-PA significantly reduce incidence adverse in-hospital outcome event ( death clinical deterioration ) respect heparin ( 8 ) . Consecutive patient symptomatic PE , since four day , confirm objective testing ( high probability lung scan intermediate probability lung scan objectively confirm deep vein thrombosis spiral CT pulmonary angiography TE echocardiography ) undergo echocardiographic examination within 24 hour diagnosis . Patients RVD normal BP ( Systolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg ) include study . 180 patient randomize study . The patient include study randomize , double blind fashion , receive Tenecteplase + UFH ( 90 patient ) Placebo + UFH ( 90 patient ) . Study treatment administer within 6 hour echocardiography . Echocardiography repeat 24 hour 7 day discharge ( whichever come first ) Tenecteplase Placebo injection . A Follow-up visit 30 day randomization include : clinical history , physical examination ECG echocardiographic examination .</detailed_description>
