	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause long-term physical disability Australia . Currently around 25 % hemiplegic stroke patient discharge rehabilitation significantly impair use affected hand consequent dependence dressing , groom feeding . The poor outcome attribute part lack focus therapist negative sign stroke ( weakness lack dexterity ) well little time ( around 10 minute per day ) devote retrain arm . Presently limited evidence base guide content clinical practice . Results animal human study suggest specific post-lesion training modulate physiological change take place undamaged tissue . It probable train induces use-dependent pattern neural activity selectively drive reorganization undamaged cortical area thereby improve functional outcome arm hand . We develop task-specific training program upper limb unique ) focus performance functional task , b ) intensity practice , patient practise task outside therapy session . Comparisons : A 3-week daily task-specific training affect upper limb compare control intervention involve upper limb training . Both intervention additional standard rehabilitation program . Outcomes measured pre- post-intervention 3 month follow-up . Outcome measure include : variable grip pinch force , dexterity , arm use quality life . Severity stroke , classify accord upper arm sub-test Motor Assessment Scale , use covariate .</detailed_description>
