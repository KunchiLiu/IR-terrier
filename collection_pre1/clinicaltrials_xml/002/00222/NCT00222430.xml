	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare use fluoroscopic guidance , ( commonly use X-ray technique ) , traditional approach , ( doctor feel strong pulse ) , obtain access blood vessel groin . These two method compare assess faster , safer often allow physician use `` arterial closure device , '' small suture plug apply end angiogram needle enters blood vessel he/she chooses .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : A prospective , randomize , control clinical trial study effectiveness apply fluoroscopy guide femoral artery access cardiac catheterization lab effect usage FDA approve femoral artery closure device . This trial randomize patient fluoroscopy guided femoral artery access femoral artery access use usual anatomic landmark study difference ability use closure device access site . Purpose : To establish safety efficacy use fluoroscopic assistance allow access common femoral artery rather branch thus increase ability use closure device . Enrollment : An approximate enrollment 1000 patient ( patient randomize ) undergo cardiac catheterization meet eligibility criterion OUMC VAMC Oklahoma City . Duration : The study conduct approximately one year . Primary Endpoint : Prediction ability use femoral artery closure device base angiographic data femoral artery fluoroscopy arm versus traditional technique arm . Secondary Endpoints : 1 . Compare incidence know major side effect femoral artery puncture two method access 2 . Compare time number attempt need obtain arterial access two group patient . 3 . Compare ability puncture common femoral artery use fluoroscopy vs. anatomical landmark among different level trainee ( cardiology fellow ) attend cardiologist . 4 . Assess whether fluoroscopic guidance superior method obtain access thus use training technique cardiology fellow . Analytical Subset : Intention-to-treat sample</detailed_description>
