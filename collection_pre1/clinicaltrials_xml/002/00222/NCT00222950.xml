	<detailed_description>The role plant sterols cardiovascular disease controversially debate . There increase body evidence indicate increase plant sterol serum concentration correlate increase cardiovascular risk . Functional food margarine supplement plant sterol ester advertise patient hypercholesterolemia . Numerous study show margarine supplement plant sterol ester reduce serum cholesterol concentration significantly . However , study available investigate relevant clinical endpoint . Nor study availabe investigate effect consumption margarine supplement plant sterol ester serum cardiovascular tissue concentration . This study do investigate effect margarine supplement plant sterol ester serum cardiovascular tissue concentration .</detailed_description>
