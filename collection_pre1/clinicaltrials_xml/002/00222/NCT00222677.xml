	<brief_title>Aspirin Prevention Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Venous thromboembolism , include deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism , common disease annual incidence 0.5-1.6 per 1000 general population.1-4 Standard treatment intravenous subcutaneous heparin low molecular heparin relay oral anticoagulant highly effective prevent recurrent episode venous thromboembolism.5 However , oral anticoagulant therapy number limitation include increase risk major bleed need laboratory monitoring adjust dose . Because limitation , venous thromboembolism usually treat oral anticoagulant limited period time . Anticoagulants generally discontinue risk inconvenience remain treatment outweigh risk recurrent venous thromboembolism . Indeed , recent study show discontinuation anticoagulant treatment , risk recurrent venous thromboembolism remain high patient idiopathic venous thromboembolism . Recently , four major randomize trial evaluate extended-duration treatment oral anticoagulant patient venous thromboembolism . In trial 90 % recurrence occur oral anticoagulant discontinue 6-9 . The rate recurrence discontinuation oral anticoagulant similar patient assign long-term therapy compare short-term therapy ( 15 % 2-3 year warfarin discontinuation ) indicate although oral anticoagulant highly effective prevent recurrence , impact natural history idiopathic venous thromboembolism . Taken together , data suggest effective therapy continue indefinitely patient idiopathic venous thromboembolism recurrence avoid . Indeed , oral anticoagulant discontinue , currently establish safe effective alternative prevent recurrence patient idiopathic venous thromboembolism . However , long-term use oral anticoagulant inconvenient need close laboratory monitoring also constrain increase risk major bleeding , include fatal intracranial bleeding . In randomized trial extended-duration oral anticoagulant ( target INR 2.0-3.0 ) treatment venous thromboembolism,6-9 annual incidence intracranial bleed 0.3 % , major bleed 3 % , case-fatality rate major bleed approximately 10 % . In addition , 5-15 % patient experience minor bleeding year . These data highlight need identify simple , safe , effective , widely applicable strategy long-term prevention recurrent deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism patient idiopathic venous thromboembolism . About 3 % patient venous thromboembolism experience arterial cardiovascular event ( myocardial infarction , stroke , sudden otherwise unexplained death ) 2-3 year first episode venous thromboembolism10 . The long-term use oral anticoagulant could potentially prevent adverse event . Barriers widespread appropriate use oral anticoagulant include physician concern regard risk bleeding , particularly elderly , well need close monitoring regular blood test measure INR . A simple , safe , effective , widely applicable pharmacological approach need prevention event . The clinical utility aspirin management venous thromboembolism matter debate . The Pulmonary Embolism Prevention Study 11 demonstrate 35 day low-dose aspirin ( 160 mg daily ) compare placebo reduce risk symptomatic venous thromboembolism , include fatal pulmonary embolism , one-third ( RRR 36 % , 95 % CI : 19-50 % , p=0.0003 ) patient undergo emergency surgery hip fracture elective joint arthroplasty . There excess fatal intracranial bleeding . In Heart Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study ( HERS ) 12 2800 postmenopausal woman coronary artery disease randomize hormonal replacement therapy placebo . A secondary analysis show use aspirin independently associate 50 % reduction ( 95 % CI : 20-80 % ) risk venous thromboembolism average 4.1 year follow-up . Taken together , data suggest aspirin reduces risk first episode venous thromboembolism one-quarter ( i.e. , 25 % risk reduction ) . A systematic overview include 8000 patient randomize trial antiplatelet primary thromboprophylaxis suggest antiplatelet therapy effective prevent deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism high risk patient ( Antiplatelet Trialists ' Collaboration ) .13 Antiplatelet therapy associate relative risk reduction [ RRR ] 39 % ; ( p=0.00001 ) incidence venous thromboembolism high-risk medical patient undergo orthopedic general surgery . There excess cerebral fatal bleeding . The European Stroke Prevention Study 2 ( ESPS 2 ) 14 evaluate efficacy safety aspirin , dipyridamole ( extended-release preparation ) , aspirin dipyridamole , versus placebo , secondary prevention ischemic stroke 6,600 patient . Prespecified secondary analysis find aspirin result 30 % reduction venous thromboembolism . Bleeding , particularly within gastrointestinal tract , important side effect low-dose aspirin therapy patient already know aspirin intolerant ( e.g. , allergy ) . Long term , low-dose aspirin therapy ( i.e. , 160 mg per day ) , associate two-fold increase risk bleeding.15-17 This increase bleed small patient without known contraindication aspirin . Evidences randomize trial aspirin asymptomatic subject , patient vascular risk factor , patient past history vascular disease ( 250,000 patient-years follow-up ) , show absolute excess major bleed aspirin 0.3 1.7 episode per 1000 patient-years , equivalent absolute risk 1 event every 1000 patient treated.15 Increasing dose aspirin , even within range 100-300 mg per day , associate increase risk gastrointestinal bleeding , low risk occur patient receive 100 mg daily.15 ; 18-19 In summary , aspirin could achieve risk reduction 30 40 episode deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism every 1000 patient treat , cost 1 bleed require transfusion high-risk patient idiopathic venous thromboembolism . Aspirin simple administer require laboratory monitoring . In present study propose evaluate use low-dose aspirin prevention recurrent venous thromboembolism patient previous idiopathic venous thromboembolism receive initial 6-month treatment oral anticoagulant .</detailed_description>
