	<brief_summary>Optimal pelvic floor muscle function know assist bladder bowel function control , pelvic organ support , well area health . It also know problem tehse area consequence pelvic surgery . By address requirement good bladder bowel function/control , organ support early post-surgery phase tissue repair scar formation critical , propose rduction longterm prevalence bladder problem , bowel difficulty weaken pelvic floor abdominal muscle post-surgery patient . This study randomise control trial compare patient undergoing physiotherapy-supervised pelvic floor muscle train behavioural therapy program control group . It hypothesise 12 month post-operative follow-up assessment , treatment group demonstrate good outcome bladder bowel function control , well strong pelvic floor muscle contractile strength control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Optimal pelvic floor muscle function know assist bladder bowel function control , pelvic organ support , well area pelvic health . It also know problem area develop pelvic surgery . By address requirement good bladder bowel function/control , organ support early post-surgical phase tissue repair scar formation critical , propose reduction long-term prevalence bladder bowel dysfunction , weak pelvic floor abdominal muscle post-surgical patient . There previous study investigate whether physiotherapy intervention assist pelvic function group surgical patient . This study aim investigate effect physiotherapy treatment program pelvic function follow gynaecological surgery . Comparisons : Pre- post-operative physiotherapy treatment vs treatment follow gynaecological surgery . Outcome measure : Pelvic floor muscle strength , urine leakage , quality life , sexual functioning , general fitness , measure 3 , 6 12 month post-operatively</detailed_description>
