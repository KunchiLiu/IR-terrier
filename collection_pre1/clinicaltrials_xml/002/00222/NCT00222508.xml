	<brief_title>The Microvascular Complications Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Microvascular complication diabetes eye , kidney nerve disease common individual type 1 type 2 diabetes , source significant morbidity mortality . Microvascular diabetes complication anecdotally report cystic fibrosis relate diabetes ( CFRD ) , prevalence unknown . 40 % adult CF patient CFRD , share feature type 1 type 2 diabetes distinct clinical entity ( 1 ) . Many clinician reluctant add burden aggressive diabetes management already complex medical regimen patient . It sometimes state live long enough develop complication diabetes . However , longevity CF dramatically increase , many patient live thirty , forty , fifty . As live longer , become increasingly likely least develop diabetes complication . A good understanding negative outcome would help resolve question whether aggressive screen management diabetes necessary CF . As form diabetes , duration diabetes magnitude chronic hyperglycemia probably important determinant microvascular complication CFRD . This information usually know time presentation CFRD insidious onset disease . Theoretically , CF pulmonary disease , include chronic hypoxia venous congestion relate pulmonary hypertension , may additionally aggravate microvascular change . However , metabolic difference CFRD type 1 type 2 diabetes may also serve protect CF patient diabetes complication . At time diabetes complication develop , patient type 1 type 2 diabetes tend concomitant obesity , hypertension , insulin resistance , hyperlipidemia atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . These factor , generally absent CF , may contribute pathophysiology microvascular complication form diabetes . The University Minnesota CF Center unique position well-characterized diabetes population , since diabetes screen instituted several year ago part routine annual CF study . In population 450 CF patient , 113 diagnose diabetes , remainder know either normal impaired glucose tolerance . In addition CFRD experience , University Minnesota strong background experience large population-based screening intervention trial concern diabetes complication . Not participate center NIH-sponsored multi-center Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) ( 2 ) current DCCT follow-up Epidemiology Diabetes Interventions Complications trial ( EDIC ) , laboratory central reference laboratory DCCT EDIC . Thus , physician , nurse , biostatisticians , GCRC staff laboratory staff quite knowledgeable experienced method use present application .</detailed_description>
