	<brief_summary>The purpose research study use relatively new technology , call Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) , study insulin work sugar body 's fatty tissue . PET image way obtain `` metabolic image '' internal organ . It involve surgery high risk process . It use successfully study brain , heart recently , skeletal muscle . In research study , use PET combination Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , study fatty tissue healthy people diabetes . In future , plan similar PET/MRI study individual type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) individual likely develop T2DM . Fat tissue might lot develop type 2 diabetes . First , well recognize excess fatty tissue , especially kind belly , increase risk development T2DM , well affect way body use insulin . Second , fatty tissue classic target tissue action insulin , regulate use sugar fat cell also regulate release fatty acid fatty tissue . Third , study mice lack fatty tissue , indicate severe insulin resistance ( lack normal response insulin ) result . Other type study show fatty tissue make protein affect body 's insulin appetite good bad way . Yet despite importance , still lack technique study fatty tissue metabolism human .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Imaging Regional Variation Insulin Sensitivity Adipose Tissue Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The association adiposity insulin resistance ( IR ) modulate regional fat deposition . For example , visceral ( intra-abdominal ) adipose tissue ( VAT ) generally regard strongly correlate IR , subcutaneous adiposity thigh ( ThiSAT ) abdomen ( AbdSAT ) , even though latter depot large VAT . Perhaps difference due regional variation AT metabolism . A limitation body composition method assess amount rather metabolism adipose tissue ( AT ) . Our aim use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image [ F-18 ] fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) vivo investigation AT metabolism use conjunction regional body composition image amount AT metabolism AT determine . Hopefully , approach give new insight AT influence skeletal muscle hepatic IR . The current project seek develop approach , generate preliminary data lay foundation subsequent project . The first specific aim conduct dose-responsive measurement insulin-stimulated glucose uptake ( i.e . insulin sensitivity ) AT human use PET image healthy volunteer . We examine effect insulin infusion rate 0 , 20 , 80 mU/min-m2 body surface area . The second specific aim assess regional variation insulin-stimulated glucose uptake AT , compare VAT , AbdSAT ThiSAT volunteer without IR . We test hypothesis insulin sensitivity ( IS ) follow rank order ThiSAT IS &gt; AbdSAT IS &gt; VAT IS . At give body mass index , fat mass constitute high percentage body weight woman men . The third specific aim assess potential gender-differences AT metabolism , test hypothesis AT IS great woman men .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>A thorough medical examination do screen examination . To eligible study , volunteer must free clinical evidence cardiac , renal , hepatic , vascular disease , major medical problem would endanger volunteer compromise scientific validity study . We recruit 20 volunteer ( 10 men 10 woman ) , nonobese ( BMI 20 27 kg/m2 ) , glucose tolerant , healthy volunteer , age 25 45 year old . Volunteers study must fast glucose &lt; 100 mg/dl ; HbA1c &lt; 5.7 % ; Hct &gt; 34 ; fast plasma insulin level &lt; 12 ÂµU/ml ; ALT &lt; 60 ; AST &lt; 60 ; Alk phos &lt; 150 ; TSH &lt; 6 ; Trig &lt; 150 mg/dl ; Chol &lt; 250 ; systolic BP &lt; 140 ; diastolic BP &lt; 90 ; negative family history ( firstdegree relative ) type 2 DM ; good health take chronic medication know affect adipose tissue metabolism insulin sensitivity ( e.g . glucocorticoid , thiazide diuretic ) . Pregnant woman woman currently breastfeed exclude study participation . Women check pregnancy ( use urine pregnancy test ) screening , within 24 hour prior DEXA scan within 24 hour prior PET MRI study . Previous difficulty xylocaine claustrophobia exclude .</criteria>
