	<detailed_description>Obesity reach epidemic proportion United States roughly 20 % American child overweight . Obesity serious health consequence increase risk hypertension , type II diabetes obstructive sleep apnea . Additionally , obesity know result earlier onset puberty . Thus , expect obese child take-on adult characteristic earlier chronologic age non-obese counterpart . Similarly , sleep apnea common problem wide reaching consequence include increase risk hypertension , insulin resistance neurocognitive dysfunction lead poor academic performance . Furthermore , sleep fragmentation produce repetitive episode nocturnal apnea may lead daytime somnolence increase food intake behavioral attempt overcome sleepiness thereby contribute obesity . Current guideline recommend adenotonsillectomy ( T+A ) primary effective therapy sleep apnea result polysomnographic resolution 75-100 % patient . Small study show T+A relieve symptom obese child surgical intervention less efficacious adult . Although nocturnal polysomnogrpahy ( NPSG ) consider gold standard diagnose obstructive sleep apnea ( OSAS ) , publish study assess efficacy treatment obese child use polysomngraphy objectively quantify degree sleep apnea T+A exist . Surgical intervention may indicate child without adenotonsillar hypertrophy . Similarly , child high risk surgical anesthetic relate complication may deem poor surgical candidate . For child well fail T+A , non-invasive , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) apply via nasal mask effective treat sleep disorder breathing . However , CPAP effective use multiple study demonstrate low rate long-term compliance adult . No study assess child 's adherence CPAP exist . Certainly , expect compliance adolescent population would similar , bad adult . Thus , CPAP recommend first-line therapy surgical intervention viable . We hypothesize T+A may less efficacious obese adolescent earlier onset puberty impart adult characteristic . We hypothesize efficacy T+A correlate closely Tanner stag chronologic age earlier onset sexual maturation associate obesity . Thus , propose study efficacy T+A treatment sleep apnea obese adolescent use polysomnography quantify severity OSAS T+A . It anticipate result preliminary study use form basis study compare efficacy adenotonsillectomy use CPAP population .</detailed_description>
