	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomic Study Realized `` Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung carcinoma fifth death cause world 2020 . In Europe cause death carcinoma breast , colon prostate combine public healthcare priority . Applying high throughput molecular analysis technology pharmacogenomics could improve lung carcinoma care strategy . The study hypothesis determination genomic proteomic profile non-small cell lung carcinoma patient allow treatment targeting , improve treatment efficacy tolerance . In order carry study , five thoracic oncology center Rh√¥ne-Alpes region collaborate several INSERM ( French national research institute ) unit new biotechnology company . The primary objective study correlate molecular genetic profile response chemotherapy case primary chemotherapy treatment non-small cell lung carcinoma . Biological sample collect patient care correlate clinical evolution ( response tolerance ) : - circulate cell polymorphism profile - proteomic profile - genetic epigenetic modification gene involve DNA repair , drug metabolism , apoptosis cell regulation mechanism , cell mobility adhesion mechanism . The main judgment criterion response chemotherapy correlate patient 's biological profile . Second judgment criterion overall survival hematology toxicity evaluate new cycle chemotherapy . The second purpose study validate less invasive method sample use blood , expectoration , urine , fixed biopsy lung tap , substitute current reference ( frozen tumor ) , reach clinical examination . This contribute set multicentric resource bank , define target new drug develop oligoarrays allow adapted chemotherapy . Two previous study ( 1800 500 patient respectively ) already carry , data sample available . For study , 600 patient include 3 year .</detailed_description>
