	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Efficacy , Toxicity , Harvest Yield Quality Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma ( MM ) incurable hematological malignancy plasma cell origin . Plasma cell clonality dysfunctional immunoglobulin production characterize disease . The consequence abnormal plasma cell growth manifest myriad symptom sign often significant impact patient 's quality life . These include pancytopenia secondary predominant distribution tumor cell within bone marrow along many effect . This study focus efficacy Doxil® ( pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ) low dose Dexamethasone Thalidomide ( Ddt ) previously untreated patient multiple myeloma .</detailed_description>
