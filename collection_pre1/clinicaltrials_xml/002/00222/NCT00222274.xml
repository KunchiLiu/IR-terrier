	<brief_summary>A grow body evidence suggest symptom many fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) sufferer might result imbalance one major stress response system , autonomic nervous system . Thus respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) biofeedback , show promise condition associate autonomic nervous system imbalance , could effective FMS . With aid sensor computer , biofeedback involve modify and/or learn control normally involuntary process like blood pressure , heart rate autonomic nervous system relaxation breathing . The goal study test effectiveness 10-session RSA biofeedback treatment symptom fibromyalgia . Forty patient receive RSA biofeedback treatment compare 40 patient receive another form biofeedback think minimally helpful ( control group ) . Later , control group patient also receive RSA biofeedback treatment . We study improvement symptom like pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance depression RSA biofeedback group compare improvement control group . We also assess whether improvement persist time change autonomic nervous system result treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eighty female patient age 18 65 recruited rheumatology clinic University Medicine Dentistry New Jersey - Robert Wood Johnson Medical School ( UMDNJ-RWJMS ) . Qualified participant diagnosis FMS board certify rheumatologist use diagnostic criterion establish American College Rheumatology . Because woman account 85 % FMS patient woman include subject . Excluded participate woman follow medical condition : neurologic disease brain injury , stroke cardiovascular disease , serious pulmonary disease include asthma , liver kidney disease , serious gastrointestinal disorder , major psychiatric condition include psychosis , bipolar disorder , alcohol drug abuse , eat disorder . Also exclude woman life threaten medical illness , communicative disorder , lack fluency English , illiteracy , cardiac arrhythmia high frequency low frequency wave indistinguishable interact . Patients require add medication regimen study period ( approximately 5 7 month ) . Based clinical judgment investigator , patient may also ask withdraw study miss two consecutive biofeedback session . After read signing informed consent , participant receive medical evaluation confirm diagnosis FMS base criterion establish American College Rheumatology . All participant evaluate board certify rheumatologist affiliate UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School remain blind participant ' group assignment . This examination include baseline tender point count TPI use exploratory measure . Next , participant ask return appointment Biofeedback Laboratory UMDNJ-RWJMS . Participants instruct refrain take caffeine alcohol twelve hour prior session physiologic measure collect . Before begin physiologic measure assessment , participant complete baseline outcome measure , Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ( FIQ ) , McGill Pain Questionnaire ( MPQ ) , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory ( PSQI ) , Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ) quiet , private room . The first appointment Biofeedback Laboratory consist introduce participant setting , equipment basic procedure biofeedback . To obtain baseline physiological measure , take 5-minute heart period record measure include blood pressure , respiration , muscle tension . For consistency across participant rest 5-minute heart period recording , `` vanilla '' baseline task include . The `` vanilla '' baseline minimally demand color detection task show provide stable baseline change response experimental challenge measure . The task involve presentation 10 12 cm rectangle computer monitor change color every 10 second . Six color present randomly equal probability course baseline period . Subjects tell beforehand count number time object change back randomly determine initial color . At end task subject ask report count . All participant also undergo simple task assessment orthostatic hypotension . Orthostatic hypotension define decrease least 20 mmHg systolic blood pressure individual move supine stand position . This assessment occur lab biofeedback session occur . First , blood pressure pulse record participant standing position . This serve first record BP pulse measure . Then , participant instruct lie completely flat floor mat ( supine position ) 10 minute . Approximately three minute participant go supine stand position , blood pressure pulse record . A stand-alone blood pressure device use record measure . Next use biofeedback , participant teach breathe resonant frequency describe . Based literature , consider rate breathing produce high frequency peak participant 's `` resonant frequency . '' Finding true resonant frequency complex task beyond scope resource pilot project . Results analysis advise match participant high frequency/low frequency rate . Group Assignment . Participants randomly assign active treatment group EEG biofeedback control group use restrict randomization procedure control age , high frequency/low frequency rate , general health status . Those assigned active treatment group give ten weekly training session RSA biofeedback , control group receive ten weekly session EEG biofeedback start immediately . All questionnaire psychophysiological data collect baseline repeat last training session 10 week later , 3 month . At end ten week , EEG biofeedback control group participant offer opportunity participate 10-session RSA biofeedback program subsequent intervention-related assessment ( last biofeedback session ( 10th ) ( 3 month ) . The Week 10 assessment , take conclusion EEG biofeedback treatment , serve control group 's baseline maintain 10-week pretest/posttest consistency group . EEG biofeedback subject compensate choose participate RSA biofeedback trial . EEG Biofeedback Condition . Participants assigned condition receive 10 session EEG alpha biofeedback . In session , 20 minute biofeedback deliver use J &amp; J I-330-C2+ physiograph . The participant learn modify specific brainwave activity know alpha . In particular , participant teach increase amplitude alpha range 8-12 Hz . Increased amplitude range associate relaxation reduction anxiety , baroreflex gain . Participants also practice two 20-minute period daily use method use increase alpha find lab session . RSA Biofeedback Condition . The biofeedback consist 10 weekly session training , time day subject . The detail procedure RSA biofeedback describe Appendix A . One single practitioner , certify biofeedback technician , provide biofeedback follow aforementioned protocol . In session , 20 minute biofeedback deliver use J &amp; J C-2+ Physiograph . The participant taught breathe resonant frequency , first step train individual produce maximal increase amplitude RSA . During first session , measure heart rate oscillation amplitude individual breathes interval two minute specific frequency , range 4 7 breath per minute , respectively 4 , 4.5 , 5 , 5.5 , 6 , 6.5 , 7 breath per minute . We provide `` pacing stimulus '' purpose : light display move computer screen target respiratory rate . The participant instruct breathe rate stimulus . We consider frequency yield high frequency peak move Fourier analysis data collect displayed C-2 physiograph resonant frequency . In subsequent session , individual give biofeedback 20 minute . The participant instruct practice breathe resonant frequency 20-minute period twice daily next week . Throughout train individual caution breathe shallowly naturally , order avoid hyperventilation . At second session , participant directly give biofeedback cardiac variability , instructed increase amplitude heart rate fluctuation occur conjunction respiration . The feedback give several form . One use beat-to-beat cardiotachometer display , superimposed measure respiratory activity take strain gauge . The participant instruct breathe approximately phase heart rate change , goal maximally increase amplitude RSA . In another display , participant show move frequency analysis heart rate , within band .005-.4 Hz . The display update approximately every second , reflect frequency heart rate fluctuation within past 30 second . The participant instruct increase spectral power peak occur approximately resonant frequency . At begin end every biofeedback session participant ask rate pain , muscle stiffness , fatigue , mood cognitive process ( memory concentration ) verbal scale one ten . In third session , stand-alone device provide home practice HeartMath Freeze Framer . This system analyze heart rhythm provide display sensitive change . A colorful game format use reward user increase heart rate coherence , turn maximize amplitude RSA . Participants instructed practice two 20-minute session per day note log include HeartMath Freeze Framer instruction whether practiced day , length practice session , question observation . Biofeedback Data Collection Procedure . At session 1 , 10 , 3 month , rest 5-minute heart period use `` vanilla '' task obtain commence biofeedback end session . During biofeedback , two 5-minute heart period recording take , one beginning session one end . Questionnaire data collect . Patients give $ 25 payment participation end data collection session total $ 75 .</detailed_description>
