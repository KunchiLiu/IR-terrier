	<brief_summary>The purpose research develop new method study insulin action use positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Insulin hormone make body control blood sugar level . We want develop way image ( look ) follow three thing : 1 ) insulin affect blood flow skeletal muscle 2 ) insulin affect glucose ( sugar ) transport ( movement ) muscle , 3 ) insulin affect glucose metabolism ( breakdown ) skeletal muscle healthy individual . The long term goal later apply method study metabolic disease , especially type 2 diabetes mellitus obesity . PET image relatively non-invasive way obtain `` metabolic picture '' body organ , use successfully study brain , heart recently skeletal muscle . In research study , use PET many four radioactive tracer ( marker ) study skeletal muscle glucose transport healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Tracer PET Quantitation Insulin Action Muscle ( Phase 1 , Phase 2 , Phase 3 , Phase 4 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal proposal develop novel triple-tracer positron emission tomography ( PET ) method image vivo insulin-stimulated tissue perfusion , glucose transport glucose phosphorylation skeletal muscle healthy individual . The long term goal later apply model study metabolic disease , notably type 2 diabetes mellitus ( Type 2 DM ) obesity ( Ob ) . While often suggest glucose transport rate-controlling step insulin action , test hypothesis control insulin exerts uptake glucose skeletal muscle distribute across flow tissue perfusion , trans-membrane transport intra-cellular phosphorylation glucose . Specific Aim 1 . The first specific aim develop triple-tracer PET method quantitative determination tissue perfusion , glucose transport glucose phosphorylation skeletal muscle . To measure blood flow tissue perfusion , use 15O-H2O ( half-life ~ 2 min ; also refer 15O-water ) . To measure glucose transport , use 11C-3-O-methyl glucose ( half-life ~ 20 min ; also refer 3-0-MG ) , analog transport phosphorylated otherwise metabolize . 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose ( half-life ~ 109 min ; also refer FDG ) , use examine glucose transport glucose phosphorylation . Because difference half-life three positron ( 15O , 11C , 18F ) , feasible use tracer , sequence , individual . Specific Aim 2 . The second specific aim rigorously test mathematical model extract quantitative physiological information dynamic PET imaging . We test novel model specifically address kinetics substrate delivery within interstitial space skeletal muscle ( i.e . 5 rate constant , 4 compartment model respect FDG . Model test entail use non-compartmental model e.g . spectral analysis ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We recruit normal weight ( BMI 19 25 kg/m2 ) , glucose tolerant , healthy volunteer , age 20 45 year old . Volunteers study must fast glucose &lt; 100 mg/dl ; HbA1c &lt; 6.0 ; Hct &gt; 34 ; ALT &lt; 60 ; AST &lt; 60 ; Alk phos &lt; 150 ; TSH &lt; 8 ; Trig &lt; 300 ; Chol &lt; 250 ; systolic BP &lt; 150 ; diastolic BP &lt; 95 ; negative family history ( firstdegree relative ) type 2 DM ; good health take chronic medication . Previous difficulty xylocaine exclusion . To eligible study , volunteer must free clinical evidence cardiac , renal , hepatic , vascular disease , major medical problem would endanger volunteer compromise scientific validity study . Subjects history myocardial infarction , proteinuria ( defined 1+ protein ) , liver disease , alcohol drug abuse , malignancy neuromuscular disease exclude . Subjects exclude take chronic medication know adversely affect glucose homeostasis include thiazide diuretic , oral glucocorticoid , nicotinic acid , betablockers . Subjects gain lost 3 kg past 6 month exclude . Because PET scanning , premenopausal woman must negative pregnancy test within 24 hour prior procedure confirm prior PET scan session . These subject also advise use reliable contraceptive technique study period . To avoid radiation exposure infant , woman currently breastfeed permit participate research study . Subjects participate Phase 2 Phase 4 ( include MRI Scan ) exclude contraindication MRI surgical vascular implant , pregnancy , pacemaker , claustrophobia . In subject questionable history metallic fragment , Xray suspect area body perform rule .</criteria>
