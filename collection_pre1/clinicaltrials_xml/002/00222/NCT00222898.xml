This particularly true pancreatic cyst , variety malignant potential encompass broad spectrum . The radiological feature distinguish benign pre-malignant frankly malignant cyst pancreas frequently underwhelming lead clinical practice sample obvious . The yield aspirate turn frequently quality upon clinical decision base . Most would agree best approach management pancreatic cystic neoplasm lie early diagnosis , ideally precancerous stage . The effectiveness applicability study base ability cyst DNA analysis stratify patient risk develop pancreatic cancer base extent accumulate mutational damage .</detailed_description>
