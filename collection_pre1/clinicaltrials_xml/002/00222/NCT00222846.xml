	<brief_title>Enhancing Adherence Type 2 Diabetes : The ENHANCE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize study , ENHANCE Study ( Enhancing Adherence Diabetes Self-Management ) test behavioral intervention , base social cognitive theory ( SCT ) , improve regimen adherence three different group people type 2 diabetes ; ( 1 ) HbA1c &lt; 8 % concurrent chronic renal insufficiency , ( 2 ) HbA1c &gt; 8 % chronic renal insufficiency , ( 3 ) evidence chronic renal insufficiency regardless glucose control . The primary aim study : 1. . Determine whether intervention improve behavioral adherence diabetes self-management regimen include : 1.a . dietary adherence , measure self-report use dietary recall Nutrient Data System , 1.b . physical activity measure CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire well pedometer reading , 1.c . adherence capillary glucose self-monitoring assess FreeStyle monitor . 2. . Determine whether intervention improve clinical outcome measure include : 2.a . glycosylated hemoglobin level ( HbA1c ) , 2.b . weight loss , 2.c . anthropometrics . 3. . Explore extent self-efficacy mediator adherence . 4. . Explore extent effectiveness intervention varies respect glycemic control nephrovascular complication baseline . 5. . Explore impact variety covariates ( medication , depression , social support , severity disease , general health sociodemographic characteristic , clinic recruit , health literacy , trust research ) effectiveness intervention . Hypothesis # 1 intervention group participant perform good attention control group participants various measure adherence diabetes management regimen . Primary behavioral adherence variable dietary intake , physical activity . Hypothesis # 2 intervention group participant low HbA1c level attention control group participant . The 6-month intervention include group class , hold weekly month 1 &amp; 2 , biweekly month 3 &amp; 4 , monthly month 5 &amp; 6 . Classes focus build sense mastery diabetes regimen feature use PDA-base dietary self-monitoring . Intervention group participant compare attention care group , receive monthly contact . Measurements make baseline , 3 , 6 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study subject include : type 2 diabetes mellitus define accord 1997 ADA criterion age 18 year great . We sample three different patient population : ( 1 ) 96 individual HbA1c &lt; 8 % , evidence chronic renal insufficiency ( serum creatinine &lt; 1.3mg/dl woman &lt; 1.5mg/dl men ) . ( 2 ) 96 individual HbA1c &gt; 8 % , evidence chronic renal insufficiency , ( 3 ) 96 individual evidence chronic renal insufficiency ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.3mg/dl woman &gt; 1.5mg/dl men , yet progress dialysis ) , regardless HbA1c level . Exclusion criterion select enhance safety ability complete study protocol . They include : ( 1 ) history hypoglycemic coma/seizure within last 12 month , ( 2 ) hypoglycemia require 3rd party assistance within last 3 month , ( 3 ) history consistent type 1 diabetes , ( 4 ) unwillingness capillary blood test use FreeStyle monitor , ( 5 ) unwillingness inability participate schedule group class individual counseling session , ( 7 ) subject currently renal dialysis , ( 8 ) factor likely preclude adherence study protocol include dementia , alcohol substance abuse , plan move within next 8 month , lack support subject 's primary health care provider ( i.e . PCP aware significant risk extreme variation blood glucose and/or comorbidities would make participation study unsafe ) , failure obtain informed consent participant , current participation another clinical trial , ( 9 ) subject available telephone hour 8am 6pm .</criteria>
