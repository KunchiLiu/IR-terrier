	<brief_title>S0509 - AZD2171 Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective confirm , complete , partial response rate patient unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma treat AZD2171 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine clinical benefit , term objective response stable disease rate , patient treat drug . II . Determine 1-year median overall survival progression-free survival patient treated drug . III . Determine frequency severity toxic effect patient treated drug . IV . Correlate , preliminarily , pre- post-treatment plasma vascular endothelial growth factor soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule clinical outcome patient treated drug . V. Correlate , preliminarily , circulate endothelial cell clinical outcome patient treated drug . VI . Correlate variant gene pathway target drug variant gene involve development hypertension antiangiogenic property drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year study entry .</detailed_description>
