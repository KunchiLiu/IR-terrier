	<brief_title>Vicriviroc ( SCH 417690 ) Combination Treatment With Optimized ART Regimen Experienced Subjects ( VICTOR-E1 ) ( Study P03672AM6 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo control , parallel-group , multi-center study vicriviroc maleate HIV subject infect CCR5-tropic virus standard antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) fail . The study evaluate antiviral efficacy two dos vicriviroc ( 20 mg QD 30 mg QD ) compare placebo add optimized ART therapy . The optimized background regimen choose investigator base result drug susceptibility test , history prior antiretroviral drug use subject , drug toxicity . The background regimen must include least 3 antiretroviral drug ( include study drug ) , one must ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor ( â‰¥100 mg ritonavir ) . There two interim analysis : subject complete 12 week 24 week treatment , respectively . Based balance safety efficacy determine analysis , dosage dosage select study additional registrational trial . The primary efficacy analysis conduct subject complete 48 week treatment . After Week 48 , subject meet applicable criterion offer open label vicriviroc 30 mg QD , appropriate , sponsor terminates clinical development vicriviroc . Additionally , subject discontinue early study prior Week 48 offer re-screening open label segment study .</detailed_description>
