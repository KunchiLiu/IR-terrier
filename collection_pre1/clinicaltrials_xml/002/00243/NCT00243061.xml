	<brief_title>AZD2171 Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective tumor response rate AZD2171 administer patient recurrent metastatic malignant melanoma . II . To assess toxicity , median survival time , 1-year survival rate , response stable disease duration , time disease progression clinical benefit response AZD2171 administer patient recurrent metastatic malignant melanoma . III . To measure baseline post-treatment level angiogenic growth factor receptor , well circulate endothelial cell , explore relationship potential correlative endpoint clinical outcome . IV . To assess change blood flow vessel permeability use dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) pre- post-treatment , explore relationship potential imaging endpoint clinical outcome . V. To look polymorphisms kdr/flk-1 , gene pathway , perform pharmacogenetic analysis pbmc 's , correlate genotype VEGF level response therapy . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow survival .</detailed_description>
