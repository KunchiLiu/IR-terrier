	<brief_summary>Treatment Plasmodium falciparum malaria Africa increasingly difficult . Resistance cheap efficient antimalarial drug pose increase threat . The rapid emergence resistance sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine , already see East Africa grow likely striking impact mortality many African region obvious alternative available . WHO recommend use drug combination contain artemisinin compound , i.e. , artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) . Previous clinical trial show combination artesunate mefloquine highly effective well tolerate treatment multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria , retain benefit rapidity action augment cure rate , apparently slow development mefloquine resistance . Compliance sequential combination regimen antimalarial drug notoriously poor . Therefore , order limit development resistance drug ameliorate patient ' compliance antimalarial treatment , optimal simultaneous combination regimen artesunate mefloquine practical single blister pack develop Mepha Ltd. successfully test .
