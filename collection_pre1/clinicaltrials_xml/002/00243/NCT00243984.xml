	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy topiramate compare placebo treatment obesity metabolic syndrome . Secondary objective include topiramate weight loss effect lipid level , HbA1C , insulin resistance , blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Topiramate Weight Loss Subjects With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topiramate anti-convulsant approve use adjunctive treatment partial-onset seizure , Lennox-Gastaut syndrome , primary generalize tonic-clonic seizure . Topiramate currently investigation disorder include binge-eating disorder . Metabolic syndrome constellation finding include dyslipidemia , abdominal obesity , hyperglycemia , hypertension . Insulin resistance believe cause whereby obesity increase resistance insulin . Weight loss type 2 diabetic know reduce insulin resistance allow great glycemic control . Weight loss pre-diabetics often forstall development diabetes . Additionally , aggressive blood pressure control diabetic reduces risk coronary artery disease . Weight loss reduces blood pressure use first line treatment hypertension . Comparison : Patients meet criterion metabolic syndrome prescribe topiramate compare patient meet criterion prescribe placebo .</detailed_description>
