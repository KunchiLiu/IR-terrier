	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Mind-Body Breathing Therapy ( Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ) To Improve Palliation Dyspnea Health-Related Quality Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives We aim test feasibility efficacy mind-body breathing therapy ( MBBT ) improve dyspnea health-related quality life patient suffer late-stage COPD . This randomize controlled trial seek assimilate number complementary alternative ( CAM ) approach aim breath-centered symptom abatement relaxation single therapy test efficacy palliative care intervention . Research Plan Patients enrol outpatient clinic , primarily pulmonary medicine ( COPD patient ) , Veteran Affairs ( VA ) Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System . Patients randomized intervention control arm . Each arm include weekly meeting VA campus 8 successive week . Evaluation include pre/post measurement , serial self-report data , compliance measure , chart abstract objective data , follow-up evaluation 2 month follow intervention death . Grant project begin October 2005 run one year . Methods The overall design randomize controlled trial MBBT intervention dyspnea symptom health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) . The study aim enroll 120 patient one year period . We enroll cognitively intact patient advance COPD dyspnea . Potential subject identify flyer provider invitation ; screen ask enrollment criterion verify consent medical record . Subjects recruit physician though public advertising recruitment within VA use inform patient physicians trial . Patients screen intake vital sign offer participation identify dyspnea least 4 10 point Borg Dyspnea Scale . Patients randomize intervention arm attend 8-week session MBBT include 15 minute video design Jon Kabat-Zinn dyspnea , relaxation response pocket-guide group practice daily prescription practice , weekly mind-body guide session control breathe . Control patient invite attend 8-week session consist support group equivalent time attention well identical measure . Results Primary study outcomes patient ' self report severity dyspnea HRQOL . Baseline dyspnea quantify Baseline Dyspnea Index Borg scale regular measure dyspnea use Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . Functional limitation measure 6-minute walk test follow baseline measure post-exercise dyspnea level Borg scale . Other symptom identify Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale ( MSAS ) part Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) . HRQOL measure SGRQ , 76-item self-administered questionnaire measure 3 domain ( symptom , activity , impact disease daily life ) , general way physical health score mental health score Veterans RAND 36 Item Health Survey ( VR-36 ) . Clinical Significance Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) fourth lead cause death increase prevalence throughout world within VA. Dyspnea among troublesome symptom patient experience . Mindfulness base meditative strategy show improve functioning quality life , palliate pain population . However , trial specifically evaluate mindful practice mind-body breathe technique palliation dyspnea . If show effective , MBBT may represent important palliative strategy management condition prevalent Veteran population medical care general .</detailed_description>
