	<brief_title>Markers Oxidative Stress Present Left Atrial Appendage Tissue Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation abnormal heart beat start upper part heart cause stroke death , untreated . In general , treatment effective frequent relapse abnormal heart beat . One explanation high relapse rate treatment might address underlie cause atrial fibrillation . Recently , find atrial fibrillation associate increase oxidative stress particular part top part heart , leave atrial appendage ( LAA ) . Oxidative stress condition abnormal oxygen form produce . These form harm cell heart , cause beat abnormally . Also , inside heart become sticky likely form blood clot . These clot , travel head , think main cause stroke condition . We find increase oxidative stress increase evidence blood clot pig mouse model atrial fibrillation . We would like see findings present human LAA . In study , compare blood tissue marker oxidative stress patient without atrial fibrillation schedule undergo cardiac surgery . It expectation participant atrial fibrillation abnormal marker atrial fibrillation . This study require participant see routine preoperative visit , undergo history physical examination , give blood , allow use discarded LAA . This tissue routinely remove surgery removal think reduce risk stroke patient develop atrial fibrillation surgery . This happen 50 % patient , thus provide desire remove LAA .</detailed_description>
