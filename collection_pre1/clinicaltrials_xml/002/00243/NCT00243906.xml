	<brief_title>Interventional Management Stroke ( IMS ) II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal Interventional Management Stroke ( IMS II ) study refine thrombolytic therapy patient acute ischemic stroke treat within three hour stroke onset . This multi-center , non-randomized pilot study provide preliminary data benefit risk combine intravenous ( IV ) intra-arterial ( IA ) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA ) low-intensity ultrasound energy ischemic stroke patient baseline NIHSSS &gt; /= 10 intravenous treatment start within three hour stroke onset . rt-PA thrombolytic , clot-dissolving drug . The primary objective study obtain reliable estimate effectiveness safety treatment approach combine IV/IA rt-PA ultrasound stroke patient ; determine estimate effectiveness combine IV/IA rt-PA 3 months—as compare 3 month outcome placebo-treated patient NINDS rt-PA Stroke Trial—warrants proceed large , phase III randomize trial .</detailed_description>
