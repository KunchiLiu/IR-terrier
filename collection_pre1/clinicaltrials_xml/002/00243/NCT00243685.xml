	<detailed_description>Application Microculture Kinetic ( MiCK ) Assay Apoptosis Testing Drug Sensitivity Solid Tumors DiaTech Oncology , LLC -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 1.0 Background Rationale : Despite use aggressive treatment protocol , le 10 % cancer patient advance disease respond therapy . There variety different cancer drug regimen , approximately probability clinical effectiveness . Identification patient respond specific chemotherapy important making decision regard chemotherapy regimen well alternative management approach . A laboratory test could help determine sensitivity individual patient 's tumor cell specific chemotherapeutic agent would valuable choose optimal chemotherapy regimen patient expectation increase response rate therapy . Several type vitro assay measure tumor cell survival follow exposure cytotoxic agent evaluate ability predict chemotherapy outcomes . As group , assays refer drug resistance assay . In resistance assay , survive tumor cell detect directly exclusion metabolism specific dye . Alternatively , since tumor cell proliferate , survival detect measurement DNA synthesis radiolabeled precursor incorporation demonstration clonogenic potential growth colony semi-solid culture medium . In several clinical study , assay useful detect drug resistance predict poor prognosis cancer patient . However , resistance assay detect sensitivity individual patient 's tumor cell specific drug . Therefore , new method determine drug-sensitivity tumor cell individual patient , thus , capable predict positive treatment outcome guide chemotherapy , would significant value . Recently , Dr. Kravtsov develop automated microculture kinetic ( MiCK ) assay measure drug induce apoptosis tumor cells1-4 . Apoptosis distinct mode cell death occur physiological condition yet induce malignant cell chemical physical factor include antitumor drugs5-7 . During last decade , recognize chemotherapeutic agent exert antitumor activity trigger apoptosis susceptible tumor cells8-17 . This imply MiCK assay apoptosis provide mechanism-based approach study effect cytotoxic agent tumor cell . Unlike `` resistance '' assay measure fraction cell survive drug exposure , MiCK assay measure fraction tumor cell kill chemotherapeutic agent via mechanism apoptosis . Therefore MiCK assay determines drug sensitivity , rather resistance . Recently MiCK assay show predict complete remission rate survival acute myeloid leukemia patient well clinical criterion did18-20 . In limited study , MiCK assay use direct chemotherapy leukemia patient 21 . The MiCK assay also use study drug-induced apoptosis solid tumor , include neuroblastoma colon adenocarcinoma cell lines22-23 . More recent data accumulate DiaTech demonstrate MiCK assay detect drug induce apoptosis primary culture tumor cell isolated patient ovarian carcinoma , gastric carcinoma , metastatic breast cancer high grade soft tissue sarcoma . Based data , suggest MiCK assay may use detect drug sensitivity profile individual patient various type solid tumor . This , turn , may provide way tailor chemotherapy individual patient 's drug sensitivity profile , , thus , improve treatment outcome , decrease adverse effect chemotherapy , increase quality patient 's life , reduce treatment cost . 2.0 Study Objectives : 2.1 To evaluate ability MiCK assay predict outcome chemotherapy cancer patient . 2.2 To evaluate ability MiCK assay guide chemotherapy cancer patient . 3.0 Patient Population : 3.1 Inclusion criterion : 3.1.1 Patients pathological diagnosis breast , lung , ovarian adenocarcinoma soft tissue sarcoma . 3.1.2 Patients de novo malignancy previous chemotherapy 3.1.3 Patients advanced refractory malignancy receive 2 standard chemotherapy treatment protocol . 3.1.4 Patients age group . 3.1.5 Patients must tumor accessible agree undergo biopsy , drainage effusion . 3.1.6 Patients chemotherapy treatment option . 3.2 Explanations : We anticipate newly diagnose patient mostly used evaluate ability MiCK assay predict outcome chemotherapy ( Objective # 2.1 ) establish criterion correlate numerical response MiCK assay probability clinically establish complete remission .
