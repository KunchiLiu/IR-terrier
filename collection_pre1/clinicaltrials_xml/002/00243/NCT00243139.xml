An alternative conservative user-friendly treatment could oral appliance , intend increase pharyngeal airway directly tongue retain device indirectly mandibular advance device . Though several randomized study oral appliance come recent year , give evidence effect OSA , shortcoming , use crossover design , small sample size , under-reporting method data lack blind . In study mandibular advancement device use parallel group design inactive device intervention control .
