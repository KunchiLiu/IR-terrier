	<brief_title>Using Barcode Technology Improve Medication Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient safety critical issue healthcare1 . Medications commonly use form medical therapy single frequent cause adverse events2 . The medication use process several stage : ordering , transcribe , dispense , administer monitoring . Medication error show common3,4 , large proportion ( 61 % ) occur dispensing , transcribe administer stages5 . Barcode technology conjunction electronic medication administration record ( eMAR ) system propose promising way reduce medication error transcribe , dispense , administer stages6 . However , efficacy reduce medication error rate , acceptance staff , cost-benefit ratio remain unknown . Without evidence clarify issue , difficult health care organization prioritize technology among many potential safety interventions7 . We therefore propose answer 3 related question study : ) What impact barcode electronic medication administration record ( barcode/eMAR ) technology reduce medication error hospitalize patient ? ii ) What impact barcode/eMAR technology nurse pharmacy efficiency satisfaction ? iii ) Can cost barcode/eMAR technology justify benefit ? We propose address question Brigham Women 's Hospital ( BWH ) , long-standing tradition innovation healthcare research medication safety . In particular , one first hospital assess impact computerize physician order entry ( CPOE ) medication safety8,9 . While CPOE important improve medication safety , address error primarily order stage medication use process , leave patient vulnerable error occur dispense , transcribe administer stage . Therefore , part multi-disciplinary patient safety initiative , BWH commit 3 million dollar build state-of-the-art barcode/eMAR system . This system include sophisticated decision support reduce medication error make beyond physician order stage . Design work near completion hospital plan implement system phase 9 month begin 4th quarter 2003 . This offer u window opportunity formally study broad impact barcode/eMAR technology . We propose perform prospective , control , multidisciplinary randomize controlled trial barcode/eMAR 's impact medication error , well evaluation impact hospital efficiency , staff satisfaction , hospital finance . Specific Aims : We plan address follow 3 specific aim propose 24 month study : 1 . To evaluate impact barcode/eMAR technology rate serious medication transcribe administration error . 2 . To evaluate impact barcode/eMAR technology nursing workflow satisfaction acute care hospital .</detailed_description>
