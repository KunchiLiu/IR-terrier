	<brief_summary>Hearing impairment either clinical subclinical characteristic renal disease patient . The hearing impairment could result specific etiology chronic renal failure . The cause hear impairment renal disease patient range drug intoxication auditory renal function , like gentamycin isoniazid , congenital disease like Alport syndrome collagen-defective renal disease , age relate . End-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient special many part general population hearing impairment . First , inflammation ESRD patient well-documented , second , suffer various underlying disease auditory function potentially impaired , third , need undergo renal replacement therapy either hemodialysis ( HD ) peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) maintain life . Dialysis find cause hearing impairment , . The biochemical change constitutive inflammation status think implicate pathogenesis hear impairment ESRD patient . Aluminum ( Al ) well-documented heavy metal , predispose Alzheimer â€™ disease , dementia neurologic disease . Al intoxication rare general health population elevate serum Al level easily find ESRD patient since excrete Al damage kidney dialyzer . Inner ear per se neurologic tissue , serum Al level ESRD patient association hare function need study .</brief_summary>
