	<detailed_description>Quality gap relevant ambulatory set include high incidence adverse drug event lack compliance establish guideline preventive care , chronic disease management test result follow-up . Clinical decision support system ( CDSS ) ambulatory computerize physician order entry ( ACPOE ) tout powerful intervention address concern . However , doubt exist efficacy system ambulatory setting , especially exist isolation . Also , despite evidence impact inpatient CPOE , impact ACPOE well study . Moreover , adoption CDSS ACPOE system slow , value proposition remain uncertain . Tightly integrate CDSS ACPOE serve promise strategy improve quality efficiency ambulatory set facilitate physician action . When ACPOE link CDSS , clinician prompt various point workflow desirable course action simultaneously give opportunity execute action ( order ) minimal effort . We hypothesize value ACPOE integrate advanced CSDSS lie improve medication safety guideline compliance , also improve efficiency provider health-care system . We hypothesize value add system overall weight cost . This study evaluate impact integrate ACPOE advance CDSS important safety quality domains ambulatory set use randomize controlled trial . In addition , evaluate impact organizational efficiency , physician workflow satisfaction , perform cost-benefit analysis . There 2 intervention period . During Intervention Period 1 , randomize selection clinic ( Arm 1 ) receive basic order entry without integrated decision support ( i.e . intervention ) another randomize selection clinic ( Arm 2 ) receive order entry integrate decision support form delivery reminder alert clinical encounter ( Intervention A ) . During Intervention Period 2 , Arm 2 clinic continue receive Intervention A . However , Arm 1 clinic receive Intervention A plus additional decision support deliver clinic encounter ( Intervention B ) . Comparisons : We evaluate impact Intervention A ( visit ) intervention B ( visit ) 2 cluster randomize controlled trial , give u accurate estimate individual efficacy . This particularly important finding highlight relative value 2 different mode decision support inform organization vendor invest development resource . We also able evaluate combine impact intervention A B ( visit ) compare outcome Arm 2 across 2 intervention period simultaneously control secular trend ( observed Arm 1 across 2 intervention period ) . All clinic , regardless randomization status , access least one intervention study period .</detailed_description>
