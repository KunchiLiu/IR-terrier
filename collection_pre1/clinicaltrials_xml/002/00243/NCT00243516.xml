	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate implementation quantitative pretest probability assessment significantly reduce unnecessary use intra-emergency department chest pain center . Specifically , study examine whether PREtest Consult acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) pretest probability assessment system significantly reduce use chest pain unit evaluation low risk emergency department ( ED ) patient , safely discharge patient pretest probability ≤ 2.0 % , reduce unnecessary procedure low hospital cost examine patient satisfaction patient pretest probability assessment use compare use . The researcher hypothesize patient control group study statistically significant reduction mean time spend emergency department , mean charge bill patient insurance carrier , hospital length stay , mean number procedure test perform without statistically significant change patient satisfaction adverse outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Use Pretest Probability Reduce Unnecessary Testing Low-Risk Patients With Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chest pain represent second frequent complaint among 110 million person visit emergency department U.S. year . Perceived medicolegal risk compels emergency physicians overt possible acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , contribute $ 20 billion unnecessary diagnostic test year . The hypothesis present work state quantitative pretest probability assessment significantly safely increase proportion low risk patient symptoms ACS discharge one emergency department . Quantitative pretest probability assess validate , commercially available PREtest Consult ACS software device , employ computer assist , attribute matching . This method match 8-component clinical profile individual patient profile share patient previously evaluate ACS whose profile store 14,800 patient reference database . Pretest probability estimate ≤ 2 % consider `` test negative . '' A phase II multicenter study find ACS PREtest Consult produce pretest probability ACS ≤ 2.0 % actual outcome ACS 45 day 0.3 % ( 95 % CI 0 1.8 % ) compare 0.4 % ( 0 0.9 % ) patient discharge negative test chest pain unit ( CPU ) include serial biomarkers , overnight monitoring , cardiologist-interpreted provocative testing . Over one-quarter patient refer CPU estimate ≤ 2 % . The present study randomize 400 ED patient non-diagnostic normal ECG troponin test order two group : 1. `` show '' , disclosure group , patient clinician receive output device , 2. `` show '' conceal group receive output . The sample size detect 11.5 % difference rate discharge group α = 0.05 β = 0.20 . All discharge patient undergo structure telephone medical record follow-up 7 45 day use validated methodology . Primary outcome measure evaluate development acute coronary syndrome . Secondary variable include : 1 . Frequency ACS , determine blind adjudicate review follow-up data , 2 . Rate return ED similar symptom , 3 . Patient satisfaction , 4 . Charges . Project significance include potential reduce patient exposure unnecessary invasive procedure save Medicare insurer $ 100 million unnecessary diagnostic test year U.S .</detailed_description>
