	<brief_title>Locomotor Experience Applied Post Stroke Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The impact stroke walk significant , 37 percent stroke survivor able walk first week stroke ( post-stroke ) . Even among achieve independent ambulation , significant residual deficit persist balance gait speed 73 percent incidence fall among individual mild moderate impairment 6 month post-stroke . Body weight support treadmill train one therapeutic method locomotor train rapidly adopt physical rehabilitation improve walk stroke . The purpose multi-center , randomize control study compare two different treatment improve walk stroke . The two treatment : 1 ) training program include use body weight support system treadmill practice walk 2 ) physical therapist monitor exercise program work general condition strengthen patient 's home . In addition , investigator determine best time provide train stroke train beneficial mild , moderate , severe case stroke . Four hundred subject recruit five facility Florida California . Screening subject recruitment take place within 45 day post-stroke . All stroke patient screened determine eligibility study . Eligible subject follow 2 month post-stroke . At time , eligible enrollment consent participate undergo exercise tolerance test baseline assessment . Following evaluation , participant randomize one three group , accord severity locomotor impairment : early locomotor , late locomotor , early home exercise . The early locomotor training group begin locomotor training program immediately ( 2 month post stroke ) . The locomotor training program out-patient program locomotor train 36 session , 3 time per week , use body weight support system step treadmill . The late locomotor train group begin locomotor train 6 month post-stroke . Participants early home exercise group receive non-specific low intensity exercise program beginning immediately ( 2 month post stroke ) .</detailed_description>
