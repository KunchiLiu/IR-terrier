	<brief_title>Implant External Radiation Prostate Cancer With Without Hormonal Therapy : A Prospective Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In calender year 2005 , 220 , 000 men diagnose prostate cancer approximately 30,000 subsequently die metastatic disease . Although vast majority men diagnose clinically localize potentially curable disease , selection one local modality another remain focus significant controversy within uro-oncology community . However , patient high risk feature often manage radiotherapeutic approach include androgen deprivation therapy . Prostate brachytherapy represent ultimate-three dimensional conformal therapy permit dose escalation far exceed modality . Following permanent prostate brachytherapy without supplemental external beam radiation therapy , favorable long-term biochemical outcome report patient low , intermediate high risk feature morbidity profile compare favorably compete local modality ( 1,2 ) . Several prospective randomize trial demonstrate androgen deprivation therapy conjunction conventional dose external beam radiation therapy ( 65-70 Gy ) result improvement disease-free overall survival patient locally advanced prostate cancer ( 3,4 ) .</detailed_description>
