	<brief_summary>Ultrasound well-established imaging modality evaluation breast disease . The investigator ' objective characterise property intravascular ultrasonographic contrast agent SonoVue ( sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles ) improve diagnostic value ultrasound examination patient different breast lesion . The final purpose ultrasonography allow early detection tumor improve differentiation benign malignant lesion . SonoVue® ( sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles ) microbubbles preparation stable , resistant pressure , specifically design use contrast agent ultrasound image . Contrast-enhanced ultrasound could provide non-invasive technique evaluate morphology breast tumour vascularity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluation Efficacy SonoVue Detect Characterise Breast Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective study evaluate efficacy SonoVue® detect breast lesion define specific microcirculation pattern patient four different type breast lesion ( enlarge fibroadenoma , suspect malignant nodule , microcalcification large malignant nodule ) comparison pathological specimen term histology diagnosis microvessel density evaluation .</detailed_description>
