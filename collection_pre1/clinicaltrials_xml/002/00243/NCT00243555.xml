	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop tool well predict clinical allergy peanut , skin test positive non allergic unnecessarily avoid peanut , true allergy diagnose , possibly without oral ingestion challenge , treat appropriately</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Algorithm Better Predict Clinical Responsiveness Peanut</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peanut allergy occur 1 % population . Allergic reaction peanuts tree nut account majority fatal near fatal food allergic reaction . Currently available treatment complete avoidance peanut . Despite avoidance , majority peanut allergic people accidentally ingest peanut . Accurate diagnosis critical , yet often problematic . Current diagnostic method skin blood test predict definitively allergic result patient falsely label . One group child never expose peanut mean prevent allergy , yet positive skin test . The mean definitively diagnose group oral peanut challenge , potentially risky procedure . Previous study demonstrate difference certain gene growth factor peanut allergic non-allergic individual . The propose study 2 phase . The first phase , almost complete , examine expression gene growth factor define group peanut allergic non-allergic individual help distinguish group . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell patient culture analyzed variety growth factor immune molecule , include mRNA , think important allergy . The second phase study involve feed peanut individual positive skin test , never peanut expose . Their blood examine challenge use information Part 1 , result correlate ability tolerate peanut feeding . This study enable u good predict truly peanut allergic . There four group patient study . Group 1 consist individual allergic peanut . This group individual positive skin test peanut previous allergi reaction peanut . Group 2 consist indivduals positive skin test peanut able ingest peanut without problem . Group 3 consist individual positive skin test peanut know ingestion peanut avoid peanut lifelong whatever reason ( e.g . strong family history peanut allergy ) . Lastly , group 4 consist control subject negative peanut skin test able tolerate peanut without problem .</detailed_description>
