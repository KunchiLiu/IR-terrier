	<brief_summary>The study team use small piece human heart remove part require surgical procedure study calcium ion pass membrane heart cell order tell heart cell much force contract heart beat . Investigators also study protein RNA piece determine newborn heart cell control force contraction differently adult heart cell . Investigators hypothesize infant heart different regulation calcium entry adult heart .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Extrapolating pharmacological surgical therapy adult ( AD ) study infant ( INF ) patient problematic knowledge cellular electrophysiology molecular biology human INF heart cell limit . The investigator study developmental difference rabbit ventricular cell extend study atrial ventricular cell isolated AD , young adult ( YAD ) INF patient . The study aim follow : 1 . Developmental difference transient outward current atrial cell . Investigators extend study isolate cell tissue YADs ( age 14-20 ) . In addition , several accessory beta-subunits find cardiac myocytes may interact Kv channel regulate function channel . The study team determine relative amount putative regulator human atrial Ito determine correlate developmental change Ito kinetics . 2 . Developmental difference amplitude regulation calcium current atrial cell . Investigators hypothesize INF atrial cell tonic inhibition adenylyl cyclase ( thus ICa ) mediate inhibitory G protein , possibly related constitutive activity adenosine A1 receptor , , compare AD YAD cell , great sensitivity inhibitor phosphatases phosphodiesterases , developmental change basal ICa amplitude beta-sympathetic modulation correlate inhibitory G protein level , receptor number M2 A1 receptor , constitutive inhibitory activity . 3 . Modulation atrial cell calcium transient change AP waveform developmental age . The study team test hypothesis prolongation early repolarization phase AP increase Ca2+ entry YAD cell faster removal Ca2+ cytoplasm INF cell determine Na- Ca2+ exchange current ( INCX ) great INF v . AD YAD cell . 4 . Developmental difference Ca current transient contractility ventricular cell . Investigators propose INF cell tissue low basal ICa , low potency ISO stimulation , high level Gialpha3 A1 receptor , great inhibitory potency adenosine , tonic inhibition ICa . We also propose YAD cell low level NCX low INCX , high level SERCA faster removal Ca2+ cytoplasm . Previous animal study indicate various developmental change cardiac cell . We specifically study human postnatal developmental change Ito , regulation ICa intracellular Ca2+ transient .</detailed_description>
