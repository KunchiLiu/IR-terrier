	<brief_title>Early Detection Mild Cognitive Impairment Individual Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our goal proposal prospective , longitudinal study examine subject three-year span establish presence MCI , evaluate progression disease , determine validity method detect early MCI . Specifically , predict use Cognitive Decline Index ( CDI ) method objective examination FDG PET brain image patient diagnose MCI mild AD , accurately discriminate early abnormality cerebral metabolism , research method validate translate clinically useful tool early detection MCI . Our long-range goal development method tool enable detection pathology individual patient risk cognitive impairment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>MCI Inclusion Criteria ( patient ) : MCI criterion meet : 1 . Memory complaint , preferably corroborate informant . 2 . Objective memory impairment ( base cognitive test score ) . 3 . Normal general cognitive function . 4 . Intact ADL . 5 . Not demented . At least 10 year education , GED , equivalent . Patients ApoE4 positive homozygous heterozygous status and/or firstdegree relative probable AD prefer , patient meet criterion include welldefined MCI criterion accept . Age : 5585 Have normal clinically unimportant physical exam , beyond consistent diagnosis MCI . Able give inform consent , assent inform consent legal representative . Centrally act medication closely track , patient medication PETscanned 24hour washout , med restart immediately scan . Because depression depressive pseudodementia often prodromal cognitive decline , diagnose exclusive . MRI finding must normal unremarkable age patient . Examples abnormal ( exclusory ) finding occult lacunar infarct , arteriovenous malformation ) Examples nonexclusory finding include mild atrophy , mild moderate periventricular white matter change . Other MRI finding evaluate consultation coinvestigator neuroradiologists clinical judgment use determine subject continue study . MCI Exclusion Criteria ( patient ) : Other neuropsychiatric diagnosis ( e.g. , stroke , head trauma , psychotic disorder , Parkinson 's ) MCI . Major medical illness ( e.g. , diabetes , severe uncontrolled hypertension ) , especially potential secondary cause cognitive decline ( e.g. , hypothyroidism ) . Disease , combination disease , presentation , clinician 's judgment , could introduce intolerable variance PET brain scan image ( example : coronary artery disease , hypercholesterolemia , 5 medication , HTN 2 yr control med , random glucose 125 , Dx DM , Hx ? TIA ) . Current substance alcohol dependence history , alcohol substance abuse within last eight week . Mild Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) Inclusion criterion ( patient ) : 1 . You must Mini Mental State Examination score great 20 . 2 . You must one sign symptoms mild AD : Cognitive impairment manifest memory problem , problem language , difficulty carry motor activity , difficulty name thing , and/or problem plan organize , impair function worsen time . You must least 10 year education , GED , equivalent . We draw blood determine ApoE genotype . ApoE4 risk factor Alzheimer 's disease . We share result , desire know result . ApoE4 risk factor . That mean possible get Alzheimer 's without ApoE4 positive , possible ApoE4 positive get Alzheimer 's . If positive ApoE4 genetic marker , include . If NOT ApoE4 genetic marker , must criteria . Age : 5585 . Normal clinically unimportant physical exam , beyond consistent diagnosis mild AD . Able give inform consent , assent inform consent legal representative . You assess capacity assent/consent obtain appropriate base Consensus Recommendations Research Consent Cognitively Impaired Adults ( 2004 , Alzheimer 's Disease Association Disorder , 18 ( 3 ) :171175 ) . If take medication effect brain , closely monitor . You PETscanned 24hour washout medication ( ) , medication ( ) restart immediately scan . Mild Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) Any problem related brain mental disorder ( e.g. , stroke , head trauma , psychotic disorder , Parkinson 's ) mild AD . Some mood disorder acceptable depression often precursor mild AD . You get MRI brain take second visit , radiologist read . If abnormal finding , tell , finding forward medical doctor . These finding may may result exclusion study . Any major medical illness ( e.g. , diabetes , severe uncontrolled hypertension ) , especially potential secondary cause cognitive decline ( e.g. , hypothyroidism ) . Any disease , combination disease , presentation , clinician 's judgment , could introduce intolerable variance PET brain scan image . Current diagnosis substance alcohol dependence history , alcohol substance abuse within last eight week . MCI Inclusion criterion ( control ) Normal cognitive screening exam . Age : 5585 . At least 10 year education GED , equivalent . Socioeconomic status , age , sex match . Able give inform consent , assent inform consent legal representative . Centrally act medication closely track , patient medication PETscanned 24hour washout , med restart immediately scan . MCI Exclusion criterion ( control ) Firstdegree relative dementia clinically relevant memory problem . Neuropsychiatric diagnosis ( e.g. , stroke , head trauma , depression , psychosis ) . Major medical illness ( e.g. , diabetes , severe /uncontrolled hypertension , hypothyroidism ) . Current substance alcohol dependence history , alcohol substance abuse within last eight week . MRI finding must normal unremarkable age patient . Examples abnormal ( exclusory ) finding occult lacunar infarct , arteriovenous malformation ) Examples nonexclusory finding include mild atrophy , mild moderate periventricular white matter change . Other MRI finding evaluate consultation coinvestigator neuroradiologists clinical judgment use determine subject continue study . Disease , combination disease , presentation , clinician 's judgment , could introduce intolerable variance PET brain scan image ( example : coronary artery disease , hypercholesterolemia , 5 medication , HTN 2 yr control med , random glucose 125 , Dx DM , Hx ? TIA ) . Dropout criterion ( ) : Subjects begin study able finish study track . Ongoing criterion termination study include : Adverse event intolerable patient prevent continue involvement study . New onset medical disorder significance prohibit involvement . Initiation recurrence alcohol substance abuse/dependence . Subject withdraws consent reason .</criteria>
