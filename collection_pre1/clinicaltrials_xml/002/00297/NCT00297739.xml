	<brief_title>Risperidone Augmentation Treatment-Resistant Aggression ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods Procedures : Study Design The study double-blind placebo-controlled trial risperidone augment agent 40 child , 7-12 year age , ADHD . All subject would treat first stimulant medication single agent , continue present impulsive aggression . The active phase treatment four week long , risperidone placebo add constant dose stimulant medication . The study include four week continuation phase placebo nonresponders opportunity receive risperidone open basis . Subject recruitment Special time effort devote subject recruitment since recognize crucial study . Our primary recruitment sit Child Adolescent Psychiatry ( CAP ) outpatient clinic , psychiatry crisis unit , child adolescent psychiatry inpatient unit . Clinical staff identify refer research team potential candidate study . Community referral seek mean professional liaison academic presentation local psychiatric facility . Possible subject schedule full evaluation telephone screen inclusion exclusion criterion . Recruitment continuous total number propose subject ( N=40 ) , complete study . Inclusion criteria 1 . Boys girls age 7 12 year , inclusive 2 . Medical/neurological clearance 3 . Meets DSM-IV diagnosis ADHD 4 . Treatment stimulant medication last three week 5 . Failure respond stimulant medication document : 1 . Three act aggression past week , two must act physical aggression people , object , self 2 . Aggression Questionnaire ( AQ ) Predatory-Affective index score 0 . This indicate primarily affective impulsive subtype aggression 3 . Minimum CGI scale rating 4 ( moderately ill ) 6 . IQ &gt; 75 Exclusion criterion 1 . Major medical problem cardiac , renal , thyroid disease , seizure disorder 2 . History alcohol substance abuse within last 4 week 3 . Previous adequate treatment risperidone ( 2 mg/day least 4 week ) 4 . Acutely suicidal homicidal 5 . Unable sign inform consent Assessment Instruments Scales 1 . Aggression Understanding aggressive episode clearly complicate need numerically quantify . Being low frequency behavior , aggression present challenge systematic assessment require research study . We employ Children ’ Aggression Scale , Parent ( CAS-P ) Teacher ( CAS-T ) version ( Halperin et al. , 2002 ) measure retrospectively frequency severity four category aggression : ( 1 ) verbal aggression , ( 2 ) aggression object animal , ( 3 ) provoke physical aggression , ( 4 ) initiate physical aggression . Responders complete Likert scale evaluate frequency act . A distinction make aggressive act direct toward person live home , also act direct toward peer direct towards adult . The frequency aggressive event multiply designate severity weight factor sum yield total score . We modify instrument occurrence impulsive aggressive event previous one-week period rat ( see Appendix ) . These “ event ” type variable fall category “ impulsive aggression ” define . Parents/guardians teacher respondent scale . Vitiello associate ( 1990 , 1997 ) study aggressive behavior child adolescent develop Aggression Questionnaire ( AQ ) classify aggression “ predatory ” “ affective ” subtypes . Subsequently , Malone et al. , ( 1998 ) modify instrument make parent interview increase range scoring . The modified version , use study , 16-item scale consist eight item assess predatory aggression eight item assess affective aggression . Items score true ( 0 ) , partly true ( 1 ) , true ( 2 ) . Predatory affective score obtain add correspond item possible range 0 16 . The Predatory-Affective index calculate subtract affective score predatory score . Higher index score indicate predominantly predatory type aggression low score indicate primarily affective subtype . This affective aggression view overreaction minor provocation often accompany disinhibition behavioral dyscontrol , characteristically impulsive . The AQ differentiate responder nonresponders lithium treatment group aggressive conduct-disordered child ( Malone et al. , 1998 ) . 2 . ADHD Symptoms The Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ; Conners , 1995 ) consist series letter present computer screen rapid succession . The subject required press key whenever target stimulus present , refrain press key nontarget stimulus present . The CPT generates separate measure inattention impulsivity . The impulsivity score derive combination commission error hit reaction time . T-scores 60 commission error hit reaction time consider indication impulsivity . The ADHD Index ( Conners , 1997 ) - Because brevity ( 12 item ) excellent psychometric property , index well suit repeat measure clinical drug trial . The ADHD Index help u understand effect risperidone treatment impulsive aggression independent effect may ADHD symptomatology . Initial visit The initial visit take place CAP outpatient clinic rest study conduct . The study fully explain write informed consent obtain parent ( ) assent obtain subject . Parent ( ) subject undergo follow assessment : 1 . Parent/Staff : 1 . Structured psychiatric interview employ computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule Children IV ( Generic C-DISC 4 ; Shaffer et al. , 2000 ) – This comprehensive , structured interview cover 36 mental health disorder child adolescent , use DSM-IV criterion . Extensive reliability data instrument available . The instrument produce series report include diagnostic report indicate endorse symptom , criterion , diagnosis . Comorbidity sample clearly identify . The parent version suitable caretaker 6 17 year old . Raters require participate two-day training session Columbia DISC trainer . 2 . Complete social history review environmental stressor 3 . Medical review system 4 . CAS-P , ADHD index , AQ 2 . Subject : 1 . Structured psychiatric interview employ Generic C-DISC 4 . The youth version suitable child age 9 17 year . The parent youth interview perform parallel except child age 7 8 year parent interview valid . 2 . Continuous Performance Test 3 . Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test ( K-BIT ; Kaufman Kaufman 1990 ) – The K-BIT brief , individually administer measure verbal nonverbal intelligence . While intend substitute comprehensive measure intelligence , adequate screening purpose . The K-BIT IQ composite score correlate .80 WISC-R full scale IQ 4 . Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) - A four-item scale widely use clinical drug trial , involve adult pediatric patient . 5 . Laboratory study include complete blood cell count ( CBC ) differential , electrolytes , thyroid kidney function test . These repeat endpoint . 6 . Urine analysis toxicology pregnancy ( female ) 3 . Teacher : The teacher give Children ’ Aggression Scale-Teacher Version ( CAS-T ) ( Halperin et al. , 2002 ) evaluate frequency severity aggressive act , distinct oppositional defiant behavior . In addition , teacher give ADHD index . The teacher best know patient complete scale . The research team discus information collect arrive preliminary consensus diagnosis . After review inclusion exclusion criterion , subject eligible invited participate study . Phase I This phase last 4 week . Subjects meet inclusion criterion randomize receive study medication ( risperidone placebo ) augment treatment stimulant medication . The dose stimulant remain constant phase . Janssen Pharmaceutica supply risperidone 0.5 mg identical placebo . All research staff subject blind study medication administer . The dose study medication start 0.5 mg/day . The dose child individually regulate optimum efficacy side effect become unacceptable . The guide principle achieve control symptom lowest possible dose order minimize undue side effect . The medication dose gradually increased 0.5mg weekly maximum 2 mg/day . Dose reduction adverse event may occur time make multiple 0.5 mg deem clinically necessary . No concomitant medication permit . Subjects attend research clinic weekly basis behavioral assessment medication distribution . At end Phase I , blind broken every subject study medication identify . Subjects receive placebo continue present aggressive behavior , define inclusion criterion , eligible continue Phase II . All subject treat clinically indicate . Phase II This phase last 4 week . Subjects receive placebo Phase I continue present aggressive behavior receive risperidone open basis . All visit , dose , assessment instrument Phase I . This represent opportunity identify potential responder risperidone augment agent . Safety Evaluations - Baseline , week 4 , week 8 applicable : Blood-cell-count ( CBC ) differential , electrolytes , thyroid kidney function test , urine pregnancy test . - Vital sign weight ; baseline weekly thereafter - Side-effect questionnaire ; baseline weekly thereafter Drug Accountability A medication log maintain subject detail dose schedule daily basis . At weekly visit subject provide enough medication one-week treatment plus additional 2 day supply safety . They require return unused medication end week . All drug supply store locked cabinet .</detailed_description>
