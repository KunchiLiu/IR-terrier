	<detailed_description>Background : The efficacy atypical antipsychotic , olanzapine , clozapine , risperidone , quetiapine ziprasidone treat broad spectrum symptom schizophrenia well low likelihood extrapyramidal symptom lead increase use substance . However ongoing debate whether treatment atypical antipsychotic associate high risk metabolic abnormality . The FDA state 2003 atypical antipsychotic increase risk glucose abnormality . For olanzapine many , study report increase risk development metabolic abnormality , glucose intolerance , insulin-resistance consequentially NIDDM ( Non-Insulin-Dependent-Diabetes Mellitus ) . Ziprasidone hand seem associate favorable metabolic safety profile.Glucose intolerance insulin resistance risk factor development NIDDM cardiovascular disease , exact determination putative effect atypical antipsychotic insulin sensitivity resistance great need . An innovative technique , microdialysis , allow measurement various analytes interstitial space , i.e . assess insulin sensitivity directly responsible compartment , human skeletal muscle . With use microdialysis possible determine arterial interstitial gradient , suitable marker plasma glucose extraction peripheral tissue , thus detect insulin resistance directly site insulin action . Aim study : To compare effect treatment atypical antipsychotic olanzapine ziprasidone steady-state condition arterial interstitial skeletal muscle gradient glucose human skeletal muscle euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp condition male healthy volunteer . Study design : Open , randomize , mono-center study . Materials method : Healthy volunteer undergo euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp microdialysis administration 10mg olanzapine 80mg ziprasidone 10 day . Study population : 15 healthy volunteer participate arm study , sum total 30 participant . Main outcome variable : The arterial interstitial skeletal muscle glucose gradient euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp condition , administration 10mg olanzapine 80mg ziprasidone steady-state condition .</detailed_description>
