	<detailed_description>This pilot study 3 part . Twenty-one patient type 1 diabetes randomize LY333531 placebo 2:1 fashion . Each patient study four occasion , euglycemic hyperglycemic without PKC inhibition euglycemic hyperglycemic eight-week period PKC inhibition . Study Part 1 : The impact PKC inhibition renal peripheral hemodynamic response hyperglycemia On even prior first study day , study participant admit in-patient research facility overnight plasma glucose level maintain 4-6 mmol/L use modify glucose clamp technique . The next day , baseline measure endothelial function vascular compliance , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , renal function , include glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , effective renal plasma flow ( ERPF ) , renal blood flow ( RBF ) , filtration fraction ( FF ) renal vascular resistance ( RVR ) obtain use inulin para-aminohippurate . In diabetic subject , euglycemia hyperglycemia maintain modified overnight glucose clamp technique . During second day study , capillary blood glucose maintain 9-11 mmol/l overnight , renal peripheral vascular hemodynamic measurement repeat follow day . The subject give PKC-inhibitor LY333531 ( placebo ) 6 week , study repeat . The first dose LY333531 take 0800 hrs day completion Study 1 The dose consist 32 mg PO OD . Study participant monitor capillary blood glucose level four time daily schedule . Study Part 2 : The impact PKC inhibition response Ang II On even prior first study day , study participant admit in-patient research facility overnight plasma glucose level maintain 4-6 mmol/L use modify glucose clamp technique . The next day , baseline measure renal function , include GFR , ERPF , RBF , FF RVR obtain . Graded Ang II infusion administer , response MAP , GFR , RPF , RBF , FF RVR measure . The subject give PKC-inhibitor LY333531 ( placebo ) 8 week , previously describe , study repeat . Study Part 3 : The impact PKC inhibition proteinuria . Subjects collect 24 hour urine sample protein / albumin excretion . They subsequently randomize receive either PKC inhibitor LY333531 placebo , use table random number . After 8 week treatment , 24 hour urine sample collect .</detailed_description>
