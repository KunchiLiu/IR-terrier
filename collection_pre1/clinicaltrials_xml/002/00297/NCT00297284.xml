	<brief_title>Memory Attention Problems Lupus : New Treatment Trial With Modafinil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 6-week pilot feasibility single-arm , open-label trial modafinil 200mg orally every morning improve cognitive efficiency systemic lupus patient cognitive difficulty daily life . Cognitive dysfunction well-recognized manifestation systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) whose report prevalence range 12-87 % . SLE-associated cognitive dysfunction often occur absence frank neuropsychiatric disease ( e.g. , stroke , depression , psychosis , cerebral vasculitis ) , medication know central nervous system effect , increase disease activity flare . Studies SLE antibody ( notably antiphospholipid antibody ) provide conflict result respect association SLE-associated cognitive dysfunction . Thus , despite numerous investigation , etiology SLE-associated cognitive dysfunction remain unclear . There know mean prevent cognitive dysfunction SLE . Similarly establish proven treatment cognitive dysfunction SLE . Regardless cause , course , long-term consequence , cognitive dysfunction SLE major cause distress , compromise performance everyday activity , decrease quality life . Thus , treatment decrease cognitive performance SLE occur , matter mild , regardless potential permanence progression , paramount importance . It imperative provide SLE patient cognitive performance difficulty mean functionally cope impairment maintain , regain independence . Modafinil safe , orally administer wakefulness-promoting agent approve use adult suffer narcolepsy , idiopathic hypersomnia , obstructive sleep apnea , shift work sleep syndrome . Since FDA approval , use many additional varied condition include depression , fatigue , fibromyalgia , myotonic dystrophy , organic brain syndrome , sleep deprivation , Parkinson 's , drug-induced somnolence . It also use helicopter airplane pilot enhance attentiveness long flight . Some SLE patient prescribe modafinil narcolepsy associate fatigue . Modafinil broad efficacy health illness . It enhance cognitive function normal young adult male , test digit span , visual pattern recognition memory , spatial plan stop-signal reaction time . While majority patient prescribe modafinil receive drug non-cognitive indication ( e.g. , fatigue , sleepiness ) , several report improved cognitive function , especially respect task require attention concentration . We hypothesize Modafinil , FDA-approved , non-specific wakefulness-promoting agent minimal side effect , safe effective use improve cognitive efficiency SLE patient identify cognitive dysfunction .</detailed_description>
