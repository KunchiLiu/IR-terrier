	<criteria>The follow study specific eligibility criterion . In addition criterion , investigator must exercise clinical discretion regard selection appropriate study subject , take consideration local treatment practice guideline . A subject eligible inclusion CCR104456 protocol follow criterion apply : HIV1 infect subject age 18 year old . All subject participate study counsel practice safe sex throughout study . Females must fall one follow category : Nonchildbearing potential : defined woman surgically sterile postmenopausal , latter indicate history menses minimum one year prior date screen visit ; Childbearing potential : negative pregnancy test result ( human chorionic gonadotropin ; HCG ) within 35 day prior administration investigational product ( Day 1 ) agrees use proven double barrier method contraception ( e.g . spermicide + condom ) study period ( followup ) . Hormonal contraceptive consider sufficient form contraception study . Screening plasma HIV1 RNA ≥5000copies/mL ( CCR104627 protocol ) . There CD4 cell count entry restriction , however investigator must exercise clinical discretion regard selection appropriate study subject , take consideration local treatment practice guideline regard CD4 cell count HIV1 RNA . Total prior antiretroviral experience least three month document genotypic phenotypic resistance least one compound follow class antiretrovirals : NRTIs ( include NtRTI TDF ) , NNRTIs , PIs . Resistance mutation must least one major mutation accord current International AIDS SocietyUSA Drug Resistance Mutations Group ( refer study reference manual [ SRM ] ) . Resistance test may current ( e.g . screen result ) and/or historical verifiable documentation source document . R5tropic virus accord viral tropism assessment screen CCR104627 protocol . Current receipt unchanged `` prestudy '' ART regimen ( i.e. , unchanged medication dos ) least four week prior screen CCR104627 protocol ; prestudy regimen may ART . Subjects must remain regimen randomization ( Day 1 ) . Subjects must able receive RTVboosted PI part OBT regimen . Due possibility randomization placebo arm , investigator consider subject enrollment whose treatment history resistance test result suggest OBT regimen construct would anticipate provide best possible virological response clinical benefit subject . The drug OBT regimen choose locally available antiretrovirals must consist three six drug , one must RTVboosted PI . Use investigational PIs become available expandedaccess similar program conduct study must authorize Sponsor prior use OBT regimen . Ability understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction . Signed date write informed consent prior initiation prebaseline study procedure . A subject eligible inclusion CCR104456 protocol follow criterion apply : Plasma sample test R5/X4 ( dual mixed ) tropic , X4tropic , nonphenotypeable base viral tropism assessment screen protocol CCR104627 . Any acute laboratory abnormality screening , opinion investigator , preclude subject 's participation study investigational compound . Any Grade 4 laboratory abnormality screen exclude subject study participation unless investigator provide compel explanation laboratory result ( ) assent Sponsor . Subjects make change ART regimen period begin four week prior screen ( protocol CCR104627 ) Day 1 . Significant blood loss ( ≥500mL ) within 56 day prior screen CCR104627 protocol . Pregnant woman woman breastfeed . Previous participation experimental drug and/or vaccine trial ( ) within 30 day 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect experimental drug vaccine whichever longer , prior screen study . Subjects prior receipt investigational CCR5 CXCR4 antagonist exclude . Any clinically significant find screen baseline ECG . Specifically , subject repolarization delay ( rest QTcB interval &gt; 450msec screen baseline [ mean triplicate value ] visit ) exclude . Subjects history additional risk factor torsade de pointes ( e.g. , heart failure , chronic and/or recurrent hypokalemia ) also exclude . History clinically relevant pancreatitis hepatitis within previous 6 month . Asymptomatic individual chronic hepatitis B ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection exclude , however investigator carefully assess antiviral therapy specifically HBV HCV infection require ; subject anticipate require therapy study exclude . Any condition , opinion investigator , may interfere subject 's ability comply dose schedule and/or protocol evaluation ( include alcohol drug abuse ) might compromise safety subject . Any evidence active CDC Class C condition opportunistic infection . Subjects stable , antiinfective treatment prophylaxis regimen allow study provide therapy specifically prohibit . Any condition , opinion investigator , might interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug . History drug allergy , opinion investigator , contraindicate subject 's participation study know hypersensitivity study medication excipients . Treatment radiation therapy cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent within 30 day investigational product administration anticipate need treatment study . Current severe illness , include liver renal failure , major organ allograft , malignancy require parenteral chemotherapy discontinue duration trial , condition would make subject unsuitable study . Subjects basal cell carcinoma skin , situ carcinoma cervix , nondisseminated stable Kaposi 's sarcoma may include trial . Use systemic immunosuppressant and/or immunomodulators within 30 day prior study Day 1 . Systemic corticosteroid replacement dos ( e.g . 10mg/day prednisone equivalent ) permit . Anticipated continue need prescription overthecounter ( OTC ) medication prohibit medication list within 30 day prior study Day 1 .</criteria>
