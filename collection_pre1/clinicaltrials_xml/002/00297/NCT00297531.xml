	<brief_title>Study Scaling Root Planing With PerioWave Versus Scaling Root Planing Alone Chronic Periodontitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extensive research show lethal photosensitization low level laser light effective method kill numerous type organisms . This therapy avoid use antibiotic along potential side effect . The initial application therapy oral cavity particularly appropriate since therapy apply topically either specific general fashion , kill immediate resistance unlikely free radical-mediated . In addition , disease state treat ( gingivitis &amp; periodontitis ) highly prevalent associate significant morbidity . The equipment cost therapy simple , easily apply relatively inexpensive compare current therapy . Based scientific data date therapy potential significantly improve oral health affect . This pivotal , prospective , randomize , examiner blind , multicenter study evaluate effect single treatment photodynamic disinfection adult chronic periodontal disease .</detailed_description>
