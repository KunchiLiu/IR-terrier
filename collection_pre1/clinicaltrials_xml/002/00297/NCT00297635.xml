	<detailed_description>The study focus follow objective : 1 . Determine whether use GlucoDYNAMIX™ diabetes intervention system GlucoMON™ telemetry device facilitate fast regulation blood glucose excursion well-controlled range , compare conventional monitoring reporting . - hemoglobin A1c end 3 month study period additional 3 month follow-up period account possible extended difference group ; - magnitude glucose excursion fluctuation indicate standard deviation glucose test indicate relative glucose control mean daily glucose value 3 month period follow initiation pump therapy ; , - frequency severe hypoglycemia extend hyperglycemia . 2 . Determine whether use GlucoDYNAMIX intervention system , initiation adult insulin pump start , result measure save staff time support data collection , analysis patient feedback include delivery follow-up monitor effect glucose control patient implementation prescribe change . This objective measured : - track number intervention day ; - estimate amount time spend collect , analyze communicate study patient ; , - daily log tally verified weekly . 3 . To determine use questionnaire administer patient professional staff whether use technology result perceive improvement quality care improved satisfaction involve . This objective primarily concern people 's willingness commit use similar technology standard practice future initiation insulin pump start adult patient diabetes mellitus . Study Design Description The study design run period 3 month intensive management enrol patient begin insulin pump therapy plus detailed glucose record begin 4 week prior initiation insulin pump therapy . Understanding relative glucose control follow intensive management require consider result patient 's HbA1c 3 month conclusion intensive management thus extend time frame 6 month . Group A The Intervention Technology Group issue GlucoMON device , GlucoMON wall-mount recharge unit , OneTouch Ultra glucose meter , paper logbook form test strip support frequent test 3 month follow initiation insulin pump therapy . The patient instruct use care GlucoMON well OneTouch Ultra one-on-one session meeting immediately prior initial delivery insulin via pump start . Patients also issue specially configured low-cost 2way wireless email device support send receive individual message 500 character include ability send can response option easy data mark . Real-time message part system describe Addendum B . The intelligent logic behind patient interaction manage server Diabetech 's remote data center thus allow easy modification centralize management patient interaction . The TJU diabetes staff initially review patient record daily document result review include change prescribe patient approximate amount time involve handle encounter . Group B ( Control ) The Conventional Technology Group issue OneTouch Ultra glucose meter , paper logbook form test strip support frequent test 3 month follow initiation insulin pump therapy . The patient instruct use care OneTouch Ultra one-on-one session meeting begin initial delivery insulin via pump start . Patients instruct complete logbook fax daily TJU diabetes center . The TJU diabetes staff available review patient log Monday thru Friday 8-5 . Emergency hour help also available . The staff initially review patient logbook document result review include change prescribe patient approximate amount time involve handle encounter . Data Analysis The data collect include patient 's self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) test data , time-event logging annotation glucose test , baseline follow-up hemoglobin A1c test result , clinical event include hypoglycemia hyperglycemia , result satisfaction questionnaires time spent analysis clinical staff patient . The endpoint measure include frequent blood glucose testing , usual patient initiate therapy insulin infusion pump , well HbA1c . The glucose level analyze regard magnitude glucose excursion fluctuation mean daily glucose value 6 month period follow initiation pump therapy . The mean standard deviation treatment group 's ( intervention control ) HbA1c calculate time point ( 0 , 3 , 6 month post enrollment ) . Statistical difference HbA1c value treatment group time point different time point group seek . In addition , change HbA1c time point ( 0 3 , 3 6 , 0 6 ) calculate . The mean standard deviation HbA1c change calculate treatment group analyze statistical significance . SMBG data analyze use glycemic control index compare efficacy treatment . The following numerical index use describe quality metabolic control : 1 . The mean standard deviation patient SMBG data 2 . The percentage SMBG data point threshold hyperglycemia ( e.g. , 200mg/dl ) hypoglycemia ( e.g. , 60mg/dl ) 3 . The M-value quantitative index lack treatment efficacy individual patient . The index describe mean glycemic control glucose excursion . The M-value logarithmic transformation deviation arbitrary standard ( select physician ) give extra weight hypoglycemic value . The original concept Schlichtkrull et al . ( 1965 ) 3 modified Service et al . ( 1970 ) 4 formula : |10 log10 ( x/standard ) |3 / n x SMBG data point , standard aM = glucose value choose define degree metabolic control ( typically 100 mg/dl ) , n number sample . BG value 100mg/dl cause M-value rise rapidly BG value 100 mg/dl cause M-value rise slowly . M-values le 18 correspond good metabolic control [ Schlichtkrull J 1965 ] . 4 . The mean amplitude glycemic excursion ( MAGE ) quantify amplitude duration wide swing BG value , diurnal variability mean BG value , episode hypoglycemia index diabetic instability . MAGE calculate take arithmetic mean change BG exceed one standard deviation BG mean precede 24-hour period . Excursions less 1 standard deviation ignore . MAGE valuable index metabolic control healthy diabetic subject [ Service 1970 ] . MAGE average 42 mg/dl healthy subject , 147 mg/dl type 1 diabetic patient treat multiple injection short-acting insulin , 161 mg/dl type 1 diabetic patient treat single daily injection intermediate-acting insulin . These index compute use move window data . The window step across patient 's SMBG data set intensive management period . Those data point fall within window use compute index . The step width window set 1 , 7 , 14 , 28 day . For example , step width 7 day , calculation M-value patient 's SMBG data would encompass 7 day would 12 different calculation week 3-month intensive management period . Statistical difference index give window treatment group seek . The amount time take nurse physicians manage patient tabulate . These data use compute cost associate management insulin pump start patient . The mean standard deviation cost calculate treatment group analyze statistical significance . A paired Student t-test one-way analysis variance use calculate significant difference . A p value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Standard Care Guidelines typically involve diabetes center distribute handbook sort patient upon diagnosis part initial visit center . In term ongoing care , patient responsible acquire tool manage diabetes . In addition insulin , patient must purchase glucose meter , test strip , lance device , lancet , alcohol , fast act sugar sort treat low blood sugar , glucagon severe hypoglycemia , etc ... Depending form insulin therapy , patient must also purchase syrinx insulin pump disposable cartridge infusion set . For duration study , patient enrol Standard Care ( Group B ) give glucose meter test strip charge . To facilitate communication blood sugar diabetes relevant data center , diabetes center share one page standardize logbook form 8.5 '' x 11 '' paper . It patient 's responsibility make copy form use also deliver complete form diabetes center need . Methods deliver logbook include fax ( patient must purchase fax machine pay/borrow well cost associate fax transmission ) , US Mail ( use envelope postage ) hand deliver ( use transportation ) . Study Population As patient elect participate assign alternatively either Group A Group B begin assignment first patient enrol Group A . Informed Consent Informed consent obtain participant .
