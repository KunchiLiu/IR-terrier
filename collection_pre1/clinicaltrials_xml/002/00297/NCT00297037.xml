	<brief_title>Pimecrolimus Cream Oral Lichen Planus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lichen planus ( LP ) idiopathic inflammatory dermatosis skin mucous membrane . Cutaneous lesion present pink polygonal papule flexor wrist , trunk , thigh , shin dorsal hand . Oral lichen planus ( OLP ) represent unique subset LP often sole manifestation disease . Clinically , lesion reticulate , erythematous , atrophic erosive , erosive form common . Lesions find anywhere oral mucosa associate burn pain worsen eating . The risk development squamous cell carcinoma estimate high 5 % . Treatments oral lichen planus involve high potency topical steroid , systemic steroid , oral/topical retinoids immunosuppressant . However , long term side effect steroid ( e.g . stria , skin atrophy , telangiectasias , tachyphylaxis , secondary candidiasis perioral dermatitis ) prevent extensive utilization except severe case . Given debilitate nature OLP , risk malignant transformation , long term side effect associate current therapy , safe intervention need disorder . Tacrolimus pimecrolimus may fewer side affect topical steroid . Recently , open label trial 19 patient recalcitrant erosive lichen planus , tacrolimus decrease area ulceration 73 % eight week course . Local irritation common side effect . However , tacrolimus come ointment base , poorly tolerate vehicle oral lesion . Topical treatment oral lesion also compromise problem maintain sufficient contact time poorly adherent cream ointment preparation moist mucous membrane surface . This study design evaluate topical application pimecrolimus 1 % cream apply twice daily occlusion treatment oral lichen planus .</detailed_description>
