	<brief_title>Gastrodin Prevents Cognitive Decline Related Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) one frequently perform operation . Neurobehavioral disorder , include neuropsychiatric neuropsychological deficit , frequently report sequela valve replacement coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) surgery . CPB associate significant cerebral morbidity . The incidence cognitive decline relate CPB range 20 % 80 % , may affect length hospital stay , quality life , rehabilitation process , work performance . Neurocognitive decline present day week surgery may remain permanent disorder . Many pharmacologic strategy propose investigated prevent post-CPB cognitive decline , knowledge , none drug systematically evaluate efficacy prevent post-CPB cognitive decline . The causative parameter cognitive dysfunction associate CPB include cerebral ischemia secondary either microemboli hypoperfusion , intraoperative cerebrovascular risk factor duration CPB , inflammatory response , cerebral glutamine release , free radical , NO release . Gastrodia elata , famous Chinese medical herb , effect prevent ischemic brain injury , neuronal cell damage apoptosis , suppress inflammatory response , inhibit glutamine receptor nNOS , scavenge free radical . Gastrodin ( 4- [ hydroxymethyl ] phenyl-Î²-D-glucopyranoside ) , primary active constituent gastrodia elata , widely use treatment paralysis , hemiplegia , headache , vertigo , Alzheimer 's disease . Based pharmacological effect , postulate gastrodin would attenuate causative parameter cognitive dysfunction relate CPB would effective drug prevent decline result .</detailed_description>
