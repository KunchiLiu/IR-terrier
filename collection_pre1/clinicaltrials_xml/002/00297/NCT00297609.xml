	<detailed_description>Introduction : Computerized physician order entry clinical decision support system ( CPOE+CDSS ) important tool attempt reduce medication error . The objective study evaluate impact CPOE+CDSS ( 1 ) frequency error order resuscitation ( CPR ) medication ( 2 ) time print order form , pediatric critical care department ( PCCD ) . Methods : Setting : An 18-bed PCCD tertiary-care child â€™ hospital . Design : Prospective cohort study . Measures : Compilation comparison number error time fill form implementation CPOE+CDSS . Errors identify review order classify potential adverse drug event ( ADEs ) , medication prescribe error ( MPEs ) , rule violation ( RVs ) . They compare year precede follow implementation CPOE CDSS . Simulated form also use test error occurrence . Time fill conventional , simulated CPOE form measure compare . Results : There 3 report incident error among 13,124 CPR medication order year precede implementation CPOE+CDSS . These represent error escape triple check three independent staff member ( two nurse one physician ) . There average 11.6 errors/100 order simulate CPR form potential ADEs occur rate 11.3/100 order MPEs rate 0.3/100 order . There error CPOE+CDSS implement ( 100 % error reduction ) . Time completion drug form drop 14 min 42 sec 2 min 14 sec ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . Conclusions : CPOE+CDSS completely eliminate error fill form significantly reduce time complete form .</detailed_description>
