	<brief_summary>Parkinsons Disease ( PD ) cause decrease dopamine particular part brain . Dopamine messenger substance ( neurotransmitter ) use cell brain ( nerve cell ) control harmonize muscle movement . Consequently , main manifestation disease affect movement include tremor , muscular rigidity , slowness perform movement loss balance . However , disease affect also , non motor function may cause disorder , depression . Depression may reaction disability cause disease , many study show depression common PD chronic debilitating illness . Moreover , also biological explanation phenomenon : dopamine also use brain circuit involve experience pleasure , loss pleasure daily physical social activity one key manifestation depression .
