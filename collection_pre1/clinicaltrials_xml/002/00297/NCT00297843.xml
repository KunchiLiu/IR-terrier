	<brief_summary>Allergic Rhinitis inflammatory disease cause influx inflammatory cell cytokine nasal mucosa . These biomarkers also find nasal secretion . The evaluation inflammatory biomarkers great interest could lead concept measure efficacy anti-allergic treatment assess change nasal biomarkers allergen challenge . To use model assessment pharmacodynamics crucial evaluate specificity reproducibility cellular cytokine level nasal secretion allergen provocation . In 2 part repeat measurement design 20 patient allergic rhinitis 20 healthy subject undergo two 4-hour pollen exposure interval 21 day . The aim study explore cellular cytokine level allergen challenge induce nasal secretion assess increase inflammatory biomarkers specific patient subgroup whether result reproducible second allergen challenge .</brief_summary>
