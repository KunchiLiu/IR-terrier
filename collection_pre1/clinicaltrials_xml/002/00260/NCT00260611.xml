	<criteria>Must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma consistent clinically histologically carcinoma prostate Confirmed androgen independent prostate cancer ( progression despite castrate level serum testosterone ) Measurable evaluable disease ( PSA elevation constitute evaluable disease ) 18 year age . Because dose adverse event data currently available use oxaliplatin patient &lt; 18 year age , exclude study . Life expectancy great 3 month . ECOG Performance status 01 . No 2 prior regimen cytotoxic chemotherapy . Androgen deprivation ( castration LHRH analogue ) , prior antiandrogens allow . Patients must bicalutamide nilutamide &gt; 42 day , megestrol flutamide &gt; 28 day . Concurrent bisphosphonate therapy allow . Patients prior radiotherapy treatment bony metastasis include time since radiation &gt; 4 week , PSA clearly rise . Patients must acceptable organ function define : : WBC &gt; 2500/mm3 ANC &gt; 1500/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL , platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 ; Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL , SGOT/SGPT &lt; 2 x ULN ( &lt; 4 x ULN liver metastasis present ) , PT/PTT normal ; Creatinine &lt; 1.8 mg/dL Adequate neurologic function define clinically significant peripheral neuropathy , define neuropathy â‰¤ grade 1 . Adequate cardiovascular function define active congestive heart failure , uncontrolled angina , myocardial infarction within past 6 month . No experimental treatment , cytotoxics radiation 4 week prior enrollment . May take investigational drug trial . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . No prior therapy oxaliplatin allow . No history allergic reaction attribute drug use study compound similar chemical biologic composition . No history intolerance allergy antiemetic administer conjunction study drug ( i.e. , 5 HT3 antagonist ) . No concurrent active cancer another primary site , except squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin . No serious concomitant illness allow , include interstitial pneumonia , extensive symptomatic fibrosis lung , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , NYHA Class III IV , serious cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus active infection .</criteria>
