	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine acupuncture improve wound heal . Since , investigator University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) , know much oxygen deliver tissue best predictor well wound heal , measure change tissue oxygen wound acupuncture treatment . We focus leg wound coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) patient saphenous vein harvest open fashion since fairly well control patient model .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , control pilot study effect acupuncture surgical site complication patient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting . The past forty year research UCSF Wound Healing Laboratory solidify follow observation : 1. without adequate oxygen delivery , many process wound heal proceed normally , particularly resistance infection , collagen deposition , angiogenesis , inflammation ; 2. hypoxic condition , unfortunately , common chronic acute wound , often result subcutaneous vasoconstriction . Sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) activator vasoconstrictor show produce wound hypoxia . Activation SNS mean , include pain anxiety , cause vasoconstriction impairs oxygen delivery . Simple mean limit SNS activity show increase perfusion oxygen tension , thereby facilitate wound heal . Many preliminary study show acupuncture decrease SNS activation , pain , anxiety . In addition , evidence acupuncture enhance circulation blood . We therefore hypothesize acupuncture facilitate wound heal . We aim quantify change anxiety , pain , stress hormone , perfusion oxygenation induce intervention , well wound heal outcome , include infection wound complication .</detailed_description>
