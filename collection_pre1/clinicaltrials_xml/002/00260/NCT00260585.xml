	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify marker blood tissue could indicate risk factor development progression esophagus cancer . This research aim collect medical history , blood , tissue sample patient present esophageal disorder . Identifying genetic behavioral risk factor involve development esophageal cancer might allow early detection prevention . Survival opportunity cure esophageal cancer depend greatly stage diagnosis . Tumors develop change genetic ( hereditary ) make-up , change sometimes see normal tissue development cancer . These genetic ( hereditary ) change serve tumor marker detect use method study change genetic material like DNA RNA . The analysis proteins provide additional information . By identify change molecule different alter cancer , investigator use method test detection change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esophageal Cancer Risk Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We enroll patient esophageal cancer , patient risk develop esophageal cancer , patient non-cancerous esophageal disorder . All patient ask fill questionnaire general health personal habit , relative ' medical history ; do preoperative clinic visit . Prior surgical procedure sample blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw research . For patient undergo endoscopy normal biopsy take , several small sample take esophagus stomach . These total eight sample . For patient undergo anti-reflux procedure without Collis gastroplasty lymph node normally remove . We receive small piece lymph node pathologist do routine pathological evaluation node . If collis procedure do , new esophagus form small piece stomach tissue discard . We study ordinarily discard tissue transformation cell normal abnormal state . The lymph node stomach tissue collect study . For patient undergo esophagectomy ( removal esophagus ) staging procedure ( perform determine size , exact location , spread tumor nearby area ) prior esophagectomy small piece tissue collect ( tumor , adjacent normal esophageal lining , part lymph node , tissue remove part normal procedure ) esophagectomy stag specimen . This tissue collect study . The sample collect analyzed genetic change DNA RNA . The sample store locked laboratory Hillman Cancer Center Research Pavilion indefinitely sample deplete . You may contact future learn result cancer screen test undergo whether anyone else family develop cancer . This information enter computer data base future study . We may continue collect additional biopsy routine clinical surveillance endoscopy one year enrollment . Again biopsy normal patient management obtain first .</detailed_description>
