Although prevalence weight loss HIV-infected individual decrease developed world availability highly active antiretroviral therapy , continue significant problem worldwide , USA . The pathophysiology weight loss HIV-infected individual undoubtedly complex ; decrease energy intake , metabolic dysregulation , intercurrent opportunistic infection , gastrointestinal infection malabsorption , hormonal abnormality contribute multifactorial origin weight loss . Although patient HIV-infection may lose fat lean tissue , loss lean body mass important aspect weight loss associate wasting . Weight loss HIV-infected patient good predictor survival , risk hospitalization , opportunistic infection . The magnitude depletion nonfat tissue important determinant time death AIDS . One correctable factor complex pathophysiology sarcopenia HIV-infection androgen deficiency . There high prevalence low testosterone level HIV-infected men . Spontaneous experimentally-induced androgen-deficiency young men associate decreased muscle mass strength . Testosterone replacement increase lean body mass , muscle strength , muscle protein synthesis androgen-deficient , young men . The study support grant previous budget period others demonstrate testosterone replacement HIV-infected men weight loss low testosterone level associate increase fat-free mass maximal voluntary muscle strength . Similarly , testosterone replacement old men low testosterone level associate gain fat-free mass grip strength . However , remain unknown whether testosterone-induced increase fat-free mass maximal voluntary strength associate clinically meaningful improvement physical function perception physical function . Therefore , primary objective compete renewal application determine testosterone replacement HIV-infected men weight loss low testosterone level improve objective measure physical function , perception physical function body image . Our previous study demonstrate testosterone replacement HIV-infected men low testosterone level associate increase maximal muscle strength . However , testosterone effect important measure muscle performance , power fatigability important determinant physical function , know .
