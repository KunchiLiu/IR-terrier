	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare photodynamic therapy transpupillary thermotherapy treatment method choroidal neovascularization age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . AMD disease affect macula , central area retina.There two main type AMD . Geographic atrophy ( dry ) AMD neovascular ( wet ) AMD . In neovascular AMD , sub-retinal neovascular membrane ( new blood vessel ) develop beneath retina . The new vessel leak cause haemorrhage lead significant visual loss . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) method treat neovascular membrane without affect retina . Photoactive chemical inject patient irradiated light pas neovascular membrane . This light strong enough activate chemical , destroy blood vessel , strong enough cause damage overlie retina . The duration treatment 83s . PDT treatment effective predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) , observed yield visual benefit minimally classic CNV 2-year follow-up occult CNV effect scarce . PDT drawback , one cost . Another patient become highly sensitive strong light . Transpupillary thermotherapy ( TTT ) thermic treatment choroidal neovascularization AMD . Using thermal diode laser ( emission 810 nm ) , transpupillary irradiation fundus conventinal contact lens perform . The temperature elevate &lt; 10 degree C 60 exposure continuous radiation . The laser power adjust diameter laser beam . In pilot study , Reichel et al . ( 1999 ) demonstrate subfoveal occult CNV could occlude visual acuity stabilize majority patient treat TTT . These result confirm small series case occult CNV minimally ( &lt; 50 % ) classic CNV . This prospective , randomize control study aim compare TTT PDT treatment occult minimally classic CNV .

	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) disease affect macula , central area retina . There two main type AMD . Geographic atrophy ( dry ) AMD neovascular ( wet ) AMD . In neovascular AMD , subretinal neovascular membrane develop beneath retina . The new vessel leak cause haemorrhage lead edema , scar significant visual loss . Sub-retinal neovasular membrane define classic , occult minimally classic accord apperance fluorescein angiography . Trials show early laser photocoagulation classic extrafoveal lesion could delay loss vision small number patient . However , patient present subfoveal membrane whilst photocoagulation limit extent subsequent visual loss , cause immediate loss central vision due concurrent destruction overlie retina . Photodynamic theray ( PDT ) represent milestone treatment CNV , mark start new era . Current PDT operate basis principal make use dye ( verteporfin ) preferentially retain proliferate tissue CNV , sensitize endothelial cell laser rediation ( 689 nm ) . Endothelial cell degeneration mediate reactive oxygen intermediate subsequent platelet activation , thrombosis , temporary permanent occlusion vessel see treated area ( Ghazi et al 2001 . The light strong enough activate chemical , cause emit free radical destroy blood vessles , strong enough cause damage overlie retina . The duration treatment 83s . PDT effective predominantly classic subfoveal CNV , observe yield visual benefit minimally clasic CNV 2-year follow-up . As occult CNV PDT effective small lesion ( 4 disc area less ) , recent disease progress visual acuity less 20/50 . In VIP ( Verteporfin Therapy Subfoveal Choroidal neovascularization , 2 year resulta Randomized Clinical trial incl Lesion Occult classic CNV ) primary outcome , visual acuity , similar verteporfin-treated placebo-treated eye month 12 examination . Between month 12 24 rxminations , treatment benefit grow month 24 examination , verteporfin-treated eye less likely moderate severe vision loss . PDT drawback , ont cost . Another patient become highly sensitive strong light need wear special sunglass 48 hr treatment . There also discussion regard lesion size potential damage due re-treatments . Transpupillary thermotherapy ( TTT ) thermic teratment CNV AMD . Using thermal diode laser ( emission 810nm ) , transpupillary irradiation fundus conventional ( laser ) contact lens perform . The irradiation resorb mainly melanin granule RPE choroidal melanocytes little absorption neurosensory retina . The temperature layer RPE choriocapillaris elevate &lt; 10 degree C 60 exposure continuous rediation . High rate resportion radiation endothelium growing , newly form vessel result thrombus formation delay closure CNV . The power adjust diameter laser beam . Laser power 400 mW 2.0 mm spot , find safe retina human eye ( Conolly et al 2001 ) . In pilot study , Reichel et al ( 1999 ) demonstrate subfoveal occult CNV could occlude visual acuity stabilize majority patient treat TTT . These result confirm small series case . This prospective , randomize control study aim compare PDT TTT treatment occult minimally classic CNV . A total 140 patient include study , ( 110 patient presently include ) . Follow 2 year . The main outcome visual acuity ( ETDRS ) , new vessel growth ( fluorescein angiography ICG ) , retinal thickness ( OCT. Furtermore patient participate quality life questionnarie ( National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnarie , NEI-CFQ-25 ) .</detailed_description>
