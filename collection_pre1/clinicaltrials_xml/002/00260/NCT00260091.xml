	<brief_title>Conventional Infertility Treatment vs. Fast Track IVF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize clinical trial evaluate efficacy , adverse event , particularly cost cost-effectiveness two alternative infertility treatment strategy patient would otherwise candidate ovulation induction IUI initial treatment . The two therapy compare conventional treatment fast track IVF . Conventional therapy cost-conscious progressive treatment strategy begin least invasive form ovulation induction , clomiphene/IUI . It progress FSH/IUI , pregnancy achieve , IVF . The fast track IVF strategy begin clomiphene/IUI ; pregnancy result , patient bypass FSH/IUI move directly IVF . We hypothesize fast track IVF therapy result higher pregnancy rate , low rate medical complication treatment , low rate pregnancy complication , cost conventional infertility treatment . The trial follow specific aim : Aim 1 : To compare number delivery per initiated cycle , proportion woman clinically recognize intrauterine pregnancy , time clinical pregnancy fast track IVF conventional treatment arm clinical trial . Aim 2 : To compare frequency infertility treatment complication fast track IVF arm conventional treatment arm . Aim 3 : To compare occurrence pregnancy complication fast track IVF arm conventional treatment arm . Aim 4 : To evaluate cost cost effectiveness two alternative treatment strategy compare direct indirect medical cost fast track IVF conventional treatment arm clinical trial . This collaborative study Boston IVF , Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates , Harvard School Public Health , Blue Cross Blue Shield Massachusetts , Harvard Pilgrim Health Care , Tufts Health Plan . Total Enrollment : 503 Couples</detailed_description>
