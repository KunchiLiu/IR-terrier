	<detailed_description>Hypotheses Key Questions I . Primary Hypothesis ( obtain + maintained employment ) : Subjects assign IPS high maintain employed rate 12-mo observation period standard VRP counterpart . I.a . First Component Primary Hypothesis ( obtain employment ) : Subjects assign IPS high rate obtain employment 12-mo observation period VRP subject . I.b . Second Component Primary Hypothesis ( maintain employment ) : Among subject employ , assign IPS work week 12-mo observation period VRP subject . II . Secondary Hypothesis : Those subject obtain competitive employment significantly reduce symptom PTSD baseline endpoint compare subject obtain competitive employment . III . Confirmatory Correlational Hypotheses : Compared VRP subject , subject assign IPS : - great work intensity ( # week , day , # hour , wage earn ) - high total earnings - great improvement quality life outcome Supplemental hypothesis ( moderator ) : Because superior integration mental health ( MH ) treatment team , social work service , community resource IPS-SE employment specialist provide part model , hypothesize IPS-SE model great success maintenance competitive employment compare standard VRP veteran PTSD challenge one psychosocial domain . From research perspective , variable characterizes subject particular treatment effective call moderator treatment . The hypothesized moderator IPS-SE standard VRP subject PTSD : 1 ) Transportation , 2 ) Housing , 3 ) Financial Means , 4 ) Family Care Burden . We hypothesize variable moderate effect two outcome : 1 ) number week participant competitively employ 12-month study period 2 ) score Sheehan Disability Scale . Several principle important define moderator . First , moderator must precede treatment . In RCT , psychosocial domain baseline characteristic subject enrol study . Second , moderator must uncorrelated treatment choice . This case RCT due 1:1 randomization , balance baseline characteristic two group . Third , moderator treatment must differential effect treatment level moderator . The treatment effect ( e.g. , active vs. comparator ) must show great one level moderator ( i.e . IPS-SE show great effect size standard VRP subject moderator present ) . Also , index combine domain explore formulated identify subject may benefit great extent IPS-SE .</detailed_description>
