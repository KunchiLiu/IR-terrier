	<brief_summary>Patients undergo surgery ( thyroidectomy hysterectomy ) postoperatively receive oxycodone intravenously ( IV ) pain management morphine escape medicine , insufficient pain relief oxycodone . Patients ' pain side effect register 24 hour answer questionnaire . All include patient genotyped accordingly CYP2D6 relevant single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) , measure plasma level oxycodone perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OXY-1 : The Pharmacogenetics Oxycodone Analgesia Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxycodone semi-synthetic opioid analgesic effect postoperative pain management comparable morphine . Oxycodone N-demethylated CYP2D6 active metabolite oxymorphone , potent μ-receptor agonist . A genetic polymorphism divide Caucasian population two group : 8 % enzyme lacking activity , poor metabolizers ( PM ) rest normal CYP2D6 activity , extensive metabolizers ( EM ) . Many different , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) responsible interindividual difference effect opioids . Among A118G SNP μ-receptor gene OPRM1 C3435T G2677T/A SNPs MDR-1 gene P-glycoprotein . P-glycoprotein responsible absorption , excretion transport many drug include opioids blood-brain barrier . The patient receive first Oxycodone dosis 5 mg iv end surgery . If pain sufficiently relieve give maximum two time Oxycodone 5 mg iv recovery room . If still sufficiently pain relieved give escape medication ( Morphine 5 mg iv ) sufficient pain relief . Further pain treatment Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) bolus dose Oxycodone 2 mg iv . During first 24 hour postoperatively patient pain side effect register . Three blood sample draw : 1. approximately 30 minute first Oxycodone dosis , 2. leave recovery room couple hour surgery 3 . 24 hour surgery . From sample plasma level Oxycodone metabolite determine genotype CYP2D6 mention SNPs determine . The patient divide two group : Responder Non-responder . The Responders characterize use escape medication ( morphine ) satisfaction pain management final questionnaire . The Non-responders characterize use escape medicine and/or dissatisfaction pain management final questionnaire .</detailed_description>
