	<brief_summary>Insulin dependent Type I diabetics require daily insulin therapy normalize blood glucose may difficulty significant glycemic excursion hypoglycemic episode crisis . Islet cell transplantation provide relief daily insulin therapy , normalize blood glucose reduce eliminate short long-term diabetes-related complication . `` PEG-Encapsulated Islet Allografts '' new islet transplant product development require ongoing use immunosuppressive drug implant . This study test safety efficacy PEG-Encapsulated Islet Allografts treatment Type I diabetes provide functional outcome measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Allogeneic Cultured Islet Cells ( human , Novocell ) ; Encapsulated Polyethylene Glycol ; Administered Subcutaneously combination biologic device product pharmacologically active agent human insulin release functional islet cell natural production release , stimulate control mechanism response blood glucose concentration . The device component uniform conformal polymer coat around islet . Islet cell isolate multiple human pancreas procure human organ donor meet specific human donor profile establish UNOS FDA 's requirement Good Tissue Practices . Because pancreas use islet cell isolation intend whole-organ transplantation , specific procurement , surgical removal , package shipping protocol provide Novocell , Inc. Organ Procurement Organizations . The primary outcome demonstration encapsulate islet allograft implant safely subcutaneous tissue without use long-term immunosuppression . The expected functional outcome implantation encapsulate islet significant reduction average blood glucose daily glycemic excursion insulin requirement well significant increase C-peptide level response meal challenge . The ultimate expect outcome patient receive implant reduce hemoglobin A1c level may associate reduce long-term diabetic complication . An important outcome reduction hypoglycemic episode crisis significantly function graft without risk associate hepatic portal vein infusion long-term immunosuppression .</detailed_description>
