	<brief_summary>This study use NIH-sponsored Women Infants Transmission Study ( WITS ) Pediatric Pulmonary Cardiovascular Complications Vertically Transmitted HIV Infection ( P2C2 ) HIV-infected pediatric cohort determine leave ventricular ( LV ) function ( particularly fractional shorten contractility ) structure ( particularly wall thickness mass ) affect cumulative intensity exposure highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( HAART ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : HIV-infected child often give HAART reduce HIV-associated disease . The long-term effect toxicity associate chronic therapy child unknown , severe cardiotoxicity suggest animal model . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The P2C2 HIV-infected pediatric cohort receive non-HAART regimen various intensity . Yet , cohort exhibit persistent significant depression LV contractility compare uninfected child ( 5 year follow-up ) . These echocardiographic measure proven independently predictive mortality . Most child WITS HIV-infected pediatric cohort expose HAART vary time vary regimen intensity . By assess LV structure function , echocardiographic protocol WITS cohort use previously P2C2 cohort , study able determine incremental effect HAART non-HAART regimen LV structure function . The study also test hypothesis HAART exposure result impair mitochondrial function result cardiomyopathy . This assess compare parameter LV structure function define cardiomyopathy frequency mitochondrial DNA mutation cell patient . A nested-case-control study design mitochondrial mutation use ass relationship HAART , mitochondrial compromise , LV structure function . Treatment intensity HAART non-HAART regimen capture cumulative score base exist 8-point ordinal scale . Intensity measure three point time : 1 ) utero ; 2 ) first year life ; 3 ) first year life . Analysis longitudinal echocardiographic mitochondrial data provide valuable information dose intensity comparative impact HAART versus less aggressive drug regimen . It also provide information impact therapy different stage child development . Similar longitudinal data viral load duration HIV enable investigator control effect HIV infection cardiovascular toxicity . The finding help determine need cardiovascular follow-up , prevention , therapeutic trial .</detailed_description>
