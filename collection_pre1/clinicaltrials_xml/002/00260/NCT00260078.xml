	<detailed_description>Because available non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) protease inhibitor ( PIs ) metabolize affect hepatic cytochrome enzyme , combination two drug produce complex pharmacokinetic ( PK ) interaction . However , little data exist regard PK anti-HIV drug combination pediatric population . The purpose study ass steady-state PK follow anti-HIV regimen : TDF EFV NVP ; TDF DRV without EFV ; TDF RTV without EFV . In addition , study evaluate age , length treatment , adverse effect , gene affect child 's response different anti-HIV combination . This study last 1 7 week . Participants study group base treatment regimen receive initiate . There three group study . Group D participant receive TDF EFV NVP ; Group E participant receive TDF DRV without EFV ; Group F participant receive TDF RTV without EFV . The inclusion EFV NVP dependent participant 's prescribed regimen . Participants within group stratify age long receive anti-HIV regimen . Antiretrovirals provide study . Most participant two study visit . The first visit occur study entry . Medical history , physical exam , blood collection occur . The second visit occur within 35 day study entry take approximately 24 hour . Blood collection PK study , physical exam , medical history do visit . Urine collection occur visit female participant . Participants undergo PK test least 14 day initiate study regimen . Participants give dose anti-HIV medication food . A blood sample take dosing . Blood sample also take 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 hour dose . Participants Groups E F may need repeat PK test within 6 week initial PK test discretion investigator .</detailed_description>
