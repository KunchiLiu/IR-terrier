	<detailed_description>Background : Heart failure ( HF ) place enormous burden patient , family , health care system society . Readmission HF occur within 30 day follow 20 percent discharge VA system similar rate Medicare health care system . Few study examine whether chronic heart failure ( HF ) outcomes improved increase patient engagement ( know activation ) care capabilities self-care management . Objectives : The objective determine efficacy patient activation ( Heart PACT ) intervention compare usual care activation , self-care management , hospitalization emergency room visit patient HF . Methods : This study employ randomize , 2-group , repeated-measures design single VA site . Following consent , 84 participant stratified activation level randomly assign usual care ( n = 41 ) , usual care plus Heart PACT intervention ( n = 43 ) . The primary outcome measure patient activation use Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) ; self-management use Self-Care Heart Failure Index ( SCHFI ) Medical Outcomes Study ( MOS ) Specific Adherence Scale ; hospitalization emergency room visit use self-report VA database . The Heart PACT intervention consist individual meeting phone contact 6 month . The intervention leader collaborate patient increase activation improve HF self-management behavior , adhere medication implement health behavior goal . The primary analysis 2 ( group : control vs. intervention ) x 3 ( time ) repeat measure analyse variance . Status : Completed .</detailed_description>
