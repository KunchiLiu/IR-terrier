	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness laboratory-made antibody call omalizumab patient Job 's syndrome , hyper-IgE syndrome ( HIES ) . Patients HIES high level IgE antibody , protein make white blood cell . IgE play important role start allergic reaction body may relate HIES symptom , skin rash asthma . Patients also frequent lung infection , easily break bone symptom . Omalizumab , approve treat allergic asthma , direct IgE . This study see block IgE omalizumab HIES patient safe reduce patient ' IgE count . It also look body handle omalizumab affect patient ' symptom . Patients 6 year age old HIES may eligible study . Each candidate screen medical history , physical examination , skin examination blood test . Participants receive injection omalizumab skin every 2 week 6 dos . At time injection , patient examine doctor , answer question symptom blood sample drawn . After sixth dose , patient physical examination , blood test , skin examination lung function test . At follow-up visit schedule 2 , 4 6 month last dose omalizumab , patient physical examination , answer question symptom , blood sample drawn . Patients show significant response omalizumab stay drug 3 month last dose discus study doctor refer doctor continue medicine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omalizumab Treat Hyper-IgE ( Job 's ) Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hyper-IgE syndrome ( HIES ) disorder characterize markedly elevated serum IgE level , eosinophilia , dermatitis , recurrent skin lung infection . The autosomal dominant form HIES , Job 's syndrome , also characterize skeletal abnormality lung cyst , cause primarily mutation STAT3 gene . The common allergic atopic symptom see HIES include characteristic rash bronchial hyper-responsiveness . The rash tend respond systemic antimicrobial , topical antiseptic , mad steroid . It unclear role , , IgE play pathogenesis allergic ( perhaps non-allergic ) phenotype . Omalizumab humanize monoclonal antibody specific FcepsilonRI portion IgE cross-link IgE . It use amelioration severe asthma food allergy , study number allergic disease . This study aim determine whether administration omalizumab safe patient HIES , effective inducing FcepsilonRI downregulation , reduce cutaneous and/or respiratory symptom associate HIES . It also aim determine whether present maximum indicate dose effect patient HIES great indicate IgE level . Finally , aim assess safety pharmacodynamic profile increase dos omalizumab likely required patient HIES .</detailed_description>
