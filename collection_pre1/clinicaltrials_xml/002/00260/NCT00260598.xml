	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate usefulness accuracy `` LIFE-Lung Bronchoscopy '' identify early change lung tissue show precancerous , cancer situ ( begin spread ) microscopic invasive cancer lesion versus ability standard `` White Light Bronchoscopy '' identify . This do part routine monitoring bronchoscopy . Patients surgical resection non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) current evidence disease ( NED ) eligible . Also eligible patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma radical head and/or neck dissection currently NED . Patients severe chronic , obstructive , pulmonary disease show pulmonary function test abnormality also eligible . In addition specialize bronchoscopy , doctor investigate use image spectroscopy . This use optical ( visualize ) procedure measure light reflect back tissue . Different lesion normal tissue reflect light differently specific color wavelength . By use measurement time ( different examinations/bronchoscopies ) small change see . This may allow eventually early diagnose precancerous cancer situ lesion , allow earlier treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LIFE-Lung Bronchoscopy Patients Risk Developing Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The North American Lung Cancer Study Group show Stage I ( T1 , N0 , M0 ) non small cell lung carcinoma patient undergone complete surgical resection 60-70 % five-year survival 3.6 % per year risk develop second lung primary cancer . Data Mayo Clinic patient underwent surgical resection sputum cytology positive radiologically occult lung cancer find second primary lung cancer occur rate high 5 % per year patient population . In collective review 1406 patient occult stage I completely resect lung carcinoma , incidence second-primary lung cancer 11.4 % ( range 3-30 % ) . The mortality second-primary lung carcinoma surgical patient much high first tumor treatment limit complicated consequence prior lung resection . Second NSCLC primary particularly vex treatment dilemma patient undergone prior curative , surgical resection limit , residual pulmonary reserve . White light bronchoscopy ( WLB ) show useful tool localize radiographically occult lesion . However , Woolner et al . demonstrate 29 % carcinoma situ ( CIS ) 69 % micro-invasive tumor identify experienced bronchoscopists . In 1996 endoscopic lung image system develop British Columbia Cancer Research Centre conjunction Xillix Technologies Corp. , know LIFE-lung Fluorescence Endoscopy System approve FDA . LIFE-lung bronchoscopy perform helium-cadmium laser use blue light @ 442 nm illumination allow visualization difference normal abnormal tissue autofluorescence . Lam others show tissue autofluorescence spectra area dysplasia carcinoma situ differ significantly normal bronchial tissue . Specifically , LIFE Bronchoscopy improve sensitivity detection metaplasia dysplasia 171 % current WLB . LIFE bronchoscopy 's sensitivity detection CIS 500 % great standard WLB . Fluorescence bronchoscopy use LIFE system identical standard flexible bronchoscopy except utilizes blue light ( Helium-Cadmium light source ) contrast white light ( commonly emit Xenon Halogen light source ) . Both fluorescent reflect light produce bronchial surface illuminate visible light , difference LIFE-lung system , image reconstruct emitted fluorescent light instead light reflect bronchial surface . Emitted fluorescence reflective light separate appropriate filter .</detailed_description>
