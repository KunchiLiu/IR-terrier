	<detailed_description>This study design investigate epidemiologic , genetic , laboratory clinical characterization individual coronary artery disease . The study group consist consecutive patient undergo coronary angiography suspect coronary artery disease . The diagnosis coronary artery disease confirm coronary angiography perform Judkins technique use quantitative coronary angiographic system . Coronary artery disease consider present diameter stenosis least 50 % least one three major epicardial coronary artery . The number diseased vessel determine classification 1- , 2- , 3-vessel disease use . Coronary artery segment define accord Coronary Artery Surgery Study classification . Blood sample vein coronary artery collect . We study coronary arteriovenous difference various marker . Urinary sample obtain day coronary angiography . We explore environmental ( include family history , life style , diet , physical activity , neuropsychological functioningï¼Œplasma level oxidative stress factor , angiogenic factor , inflammatory marker , etc . ) genetic ( include oxidative stress factor inflammatory factor , etc . ) risk factor . We study association various environmental risk factor clinical characterization correlation genetic polymorphism presence coronary artery disease .</detailed_description>
