	<detailed_description>Research Stream 1 : Treatment Cost Effectiveness The primary aim Stream 1 evaluate effectiveness model-driven psychological intervention , CBT prevent delay onset psychotic illness evaluate effectiveness CBT reduce present concern sample help-seeking individual operationally define ultra high risk develop psychotic illness . CBT compare supportive therapy ( ST ) . We also examine cost-effectiveness preventive approach . Using cost-consequence approach , examine cost-effectiveness CBT versus supportive therapy address psychosis `` ultra high risk '' phase perspective payer ( i.e. , Ministry Health Long-Term Care ) . The hypothesis : ( ) The time conversion significantly longer CBT group compare ST condition . ( ii ) The mean level attenuate psychotic symptom ( SOPS rating ) significantly low CBT group compare ST group completion intervention follow point . ( iii ) Levels risk factor ( measure CMRS &amp; GHQ2 ) significantly low CBT group compare ST group completion intervention follow point . ( iv ) Levels depression anxiety ( measure CDSS , BAS , SPAI2 ) significantly low CBT group compare ST group completion intervention follow point . ( v ) Level social functioning ( measure SFS2 ) significantly high CBT group compare ST group termination trial follow point . ( vi ) CBT cost-effective ST. Research Stream 2 : Pathways Care The aim stream 2 obtain in-depth story way ultra high risk develop psychotic illness come seek help mental health service . By mental health service , include formal system ( specialty mental health &amp; general medical care ) , lay system ( friend , family , self-help ) , folk system ( alternative healer ) human social service system ( clergy , teacher , police ) .

These case study employ empirically develop theory relate pathway mental health care . Theoretical Propositions : The follow four theoretical proposition relate pathway mental health care formulate base Network Episode Model describe . The focus stream upon evaluation , refinement elaboration four theoretical proposition . Multiple case study methodology employ empirically develop theory relate pathway mental health care . ( ) Family content ( e.g. , beliefs experience medical system ) , structure ( e.g. , size , amount support ) function ( e.g. , advice , support coercion ) critical influence pathway mental health care youth ultra high risk psychosis . ( ii ) The community school content , structure function critical influence pathway mental health care youth ultra high risk psychosis . ( iii ) Problem recognition illness experience perceive individual significant others critical influence pathway mental health care youth ultra high risk psychosis . ( iv ) The content , structure function ( e.g . organizational constraint ) treatment system critical influence pathway mental health care youth ultra high risk psychosis . Research Stream 3 : Costs Caring Psychosis The aim third research stream explore burden healthcare system informal caregiver associate ultra high risk population . We seek address three primary question : ( ) What key component affect cost care ultra high risk population ? These cost consider respect formal informal care provider ( i.e. , service system family caregiver , respectively ) . ( ii ) What psychological cost care informal caregiver face ? ( i.e . modification parental work schedule accommodate child 's need , impact sibling ) ( iii ) Over time , cost care change term economic psychological cost ?</detailed_description>
