	<brief_title>The Hearing Aid Effectiveness After Aural Rehabilitation ( HEAR ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The number hearing aid dispense VA nearly quadruple 75,000 1996 283,000 2003 . However , number audiologists serve population less double ( 72 % increase ) period . This imbalance result burgeon wait time audiology appointment , negatively impact quality life thousand veteran wait hear aid . Reduction wait time efficient use limited resource maintain high quality care great interest VA leadership . Objectives : The orientation portion hearing aid fitting appointment hear aid follow-up visit 4 The researcherseks later impart standard information relevant new hearing aid patient , may highly conducive group format . Our specific aim compare group current standard individual aural rehabilitation appointment determine : 1 ) group visit least effective ( 'non-inferior ' ) individual visit audiology appointment , 2 ) use group visit lead low cost VA. Methods : The researcher propose non-inferiority , randomize clinical trial compare effectiveness group vs. individual audiology appointment . The researcher compare group vs. individual visit two type audiology appointment : hearing aid fitting ( orientation ) hearing aid follow-up . The researcher hypothesize : 1 ) group visit least effective individual visit , measure hearing-related quality life hearing aid adherence , 2 ) group visit lead cost saving , immediate treatment period , throughout 6-month aural rehabilitation period . Setting Population . The researcher propose enroll 660 new hear aid patient audiology clinic Seattle American Lake Divisions VA Puget Sound Health Care System . Randomized Interventions . Patients randomize group vs. individual orientation ( intervention # 1 ) group vs. individual follow-up ( intervention # 2 ) visit . Status : Recruitment complete . The primary effectiveness outcome hearing-related quality life 6 month hear aid fitting . Secondary effectiveness outcome include hear aid adherence satisfaction hear amplification . Cost utilization outcome include audiology labor initial visit subsequent unplanned visit , cost hearing aid , number hearing aid repair . The researcher select time frame 6 month pilot data show 75 % unplanned visit occur first 6 month . Analysis . An intention-to-treat analysis use minimize bias due subject self-selection . The researcher choose sample size adequate detect non-inferiority hearing-related quality life patient undergo group rehabilitation either intervention . Analyses intervention stratify degree hearing loss , binaural vs. monaural hearing aid use , group vs. individual appointment intervention . Cost-effectiveness analysis pursue great effectiveness high cost document , case pilot calculation unit cost obtain additional successfully treat patient ( clinically important improvement 6 point Inner EAR scale ) make . Benefit VA . This proposal directly address three VA 's designate research area : sensory disorder , age , health service . In addition , application directly responsive HSR &amp; D Solicitation sensory disorder loss . This project potential help VA leadership identify efficient treatment maintains high quality care one common disability veteran , provide insight value group visit model care .</detailed_description>
