	<brief_title>Erythropoietin Effects After Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury occur alarm frequency United States associate significant morbidity , mortality economic well emotional consequence . Since initial traumatic event produce irreparable primary brain injury , goal care head injure patient focus upon prevention secondary brain injury . Currently , clinical strategy available prevent secondary brain injury relate maintenance adequate cerebral blood flow regulation intracranial pressure . Now , substantial laboratory evidence indicate secondary neuronal cell death reduce use recombinant human erythropoietin ( EPO ) time-dependent fashion . These data suggest strategy utilize EPO resuscitative phase head injure patient could improve neurologic outcome . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled single-center trial . All blunt trauma patient 18 year age admission GCS 9 13 evidence traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) CT eligible . After obtain informed consent , patient randomize receive EPO ( 40,000 Units IV ) placebo administer within 6 hour injury . Patients baseline ( day injury ) daily serum S-100B NSE level measure 5 day injury . Demographic clinical data obtain include age , gender , head AIS , ISS , admission ICU GCS , daily mean ICP CPP ( ICP monitor ) , number nature ICP lower intervention daily mean PaCO2 . The primary outcome measure S-100B NSE level patient receive EPO compare receive placebo . Secondary outcome measure include ICU LOS , GCS ICU discharge , 3-month 6-month Glascow Outcome Score in-hospital mortality .</detailed_description>
