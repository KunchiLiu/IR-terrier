	<brief_title>Comparison Alveolar Macrophages Individuals With COPD Versus Smokers With Normal Pulmonary Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : COPD one press healthcare problem face nation . Acute exacerbation COPD ( AE-COPD ) responsible bulk healthcare cost , much morbidity decline health status among individual common disease . The lack accept animal model AE-COPD necessitates novel approach use human sample . Advances understand pathogenesis slow , part , due controversy exacerbation define . The prevail paradigm define AE-COPD event-based . Such definition clearly identify group patient accelerated loss pulmonary function increase mortality . However , limited data show symptom-based definition AE-COPD also capture episodes induce significant morbidity functional decline , hence concern patient . Fundamental mechanism lack explain AE-COPD define either mean . Controversy also surround trigger AE-COPD . Bacteria viruses involve episode , relative importance intertwine dispute definition AE-COPD . Progress link specific pathogen molecular pathogenesis slow , due diversity , high rate bacterial colonization patient COPD , even stable state . Moreover , many AE-COPD case , pathogen identify . Without negate value analyze infection specific specie pathogen , appear progress molecular pathogenesis could accelerate focus unifying feature pulmonary immune response AE-COPD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The purpose experiment determine whether AMø patient COPD show abnormal responsiveness bacterial viral product , relative smoker normal pulmonary function . Specifically , study determine dose-response characteristic AMø two group subject production interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-18 , IL-23 ( pro-inflammatory cytokine ) stimulation purify Lipopolysaccharide , synthetic lipopeptide ( PAM3-Cys ) , poly I : C. These stimulus mimic response Gram-negative bacteria , Gram-positive bacteria , RNA viruses , respectively . This research protocol involve add research bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) clinically indicate bronchoscopy perform evaluation lung nodule suspect possibly malignant . The research BAL perform procedure , opposite lung radiographic lesion motivate bronchoscopy . Subjects COPD patient smoker normal pulmonary function recruit Pulmonary Clinic . Smoking history take mean least 20 pack-years exposure , could include current ex-smokers . Bronchoscopy perform conscious sedation use fiberoptic bronchoscope , almost case outpatient ( although stable inpatient could consider consent otherwise meet eligibility criterion ) . The set Endoscopy suite Ann Arbor VA Hospital . The procedure protocol involve follow upon enrollment : bronchoalveolar lavage ( 200 ml maximal instilled volume ) collection blood hematocrit , serum albumin , C-reactive protein , IL-6 .</detailed_description>
