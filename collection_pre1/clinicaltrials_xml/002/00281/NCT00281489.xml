	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Ways Preventing Patients From Being Awake During High-Risk Surgery Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General anesthesia state drug-induced unconsciousness , patient neither perceive recall noxious stimulus . Many patient face surgery dread prospect awake , pain unable move owe inadequate general anesthesia . A large multi-center study USA show , despite modern anesthesia technique , overall incidence awareness conscious recall remain 0.1-0.2 % . For high-risk ( awareness ) surgery , cardiac surgery , trauma surgery obstetric surgery , incidence conscious recall approach 1 % . This lead extreme anxiety even posttraumatic stress disorder . Several monitor , include Bispectral Index ( BIS ) , base process electroencephalographic information , develop attempt monitor depth anesthesia . A recent landmark study suggest harness information provide BIS monitor decrease incidence explicit recall high-risk surgical procedure almost 1 % 0.1 % . The possible impact study enormous . The American Society Anesthesiologists American Association Nurse Anesthetists currently consider neurological monitor essential part routine anesthesia care . Increasingly , member anesthetic community suggest every patient undergo general anesthesia , especially procedures risk awareness consider high , neurological monitor , BIS monitor , routinely apply . Explicit recall general anesthesia major concern among member public even feature popular Oprah Winfrey Show . Several patient present surgery Barnes Jewish Hospital question whether anesthesia provider would use BIS monitor `` prevent awareness '' . Excluding cost BIS monitor , cost use BIS $ 17.50 disposable strip . If monitor use every anesthetic administer Barnes Jewish Hospital , might translate annual cost $ 500,000 . Explicit recall , especially patient aware unable move , serious complication frequently precipitate posttraumatic stress disorder . If indeed BIS monitor decrease incidence explicit recall , could translate cost effective importantly clinically imperative intervention . Currently BIS monitor , similar alternative , use routinely monitor depth general anesthesia Barnes Jewish Hospital . However , several concern regard study conduct use BIS monitor . There parameter guide administration anesthesia control group . BIS data collect patient control group , prevents retrospective analysis assessment true sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value BIS recording . Most study fund manufacturer device , introduce potential conflict interest investigator bias . In view current pressure adopt BIS monitoring equivalent standard anesthesia care , essential conduct study address concern . The hypothesis propose study anesthetic algorithm design high-risk surgical patient incidence awareness equivalent low group anesthesia depth guide BIS monitor .</detailed_description>
