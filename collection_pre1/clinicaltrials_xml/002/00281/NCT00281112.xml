	<brief_title>Center Reducing Asthma Disparities - Howard/Hopkins Centers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma serious chronic condition affect 14 million Americans , prevalence rate higher certain population ( e.g . 10 percent inner-cities 30 percent among homeless vs. 5 percent general population white ) . African Americans Hispanics Northeast twice likely die asthma white . African Americans four time likely hospitalize asthma five time likely white seek care asthma emergency department . Reasons high rate certain , likely result interaction risk factor environmental exposure , genetic predisposition , access appropriate medical care , socioeconomic status , cultural health practice . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute support variety activity address press public health problem pose asthma . However , progress reduce disparity disappointingly slow . Separate , independent research project generate important clue understanding nature scope problem . A coordinated , interdisciplinary comprehensive approach research need take advantage clue , move science faster , increase capacity improve health outcome among minority economically disadvantage population . Cooperative center research foster partnership among minority medical center , research intensive institution , community asthma patient live promote advancement . The Request Applications Centers Reducing Asthma Disparities release October , 2001 . The objective program promote partnership ( call Centers ) minority serve institution ( MSI ) may strong research program research intensive institution ( RII ) track record NIH-supported research patient care . The purpose partnership conduct collaborative research asthma disparity ( i.e . great prevalence asthma , high rate morbidity due asthma , less access use quality medical care among minority poor ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The center four research project design collaboratively investigate factor associate disproportionate burden asthma experience inner-city , African-American child adult . This include study evaluate underlying genetic factor may contribute observe excess risk African-American community , well study provider-patient communication design assess intervention strategy remediate risk . In addition , essential goal Howard/Hopkins Center Reducing Asthma Disparities create culturally sensitive training environment truly reciprocal , design enrich enhance research potential asthma management capability participate institution . Research project 1 create validate culturally sensitive simple administer Asthma Communication Instrument use describe asthma symptom . Research project 2 develop tripartite communication mechanism patient , patient care provider , asthma counselor . Research project 3 deal genetics cockroach allergy . Research project 4 develop complementary mouse model address role genetics cockroach sensitization pertains asthma disparity . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
