	<brief_title>Study In Women And Men With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Have Overexpression Of ErbB2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients must Her2+ ( ErbB2+ ) MBC Stage IV , newly diagnose receive paclitaxel+lapatinib paclitaxel plus placebo 6 cycle minimum . After 6 cycle continue receive blind monotherapy progression . Safety evaluation include evaluate adverse event , hematology/ chemistry test , vital sign , cardiac muga scan . Efficacy assessment include evaluation disease per RECIST . All patient follow overall survival ( OS ) . Study conduct region access trastuzumab limit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Signed informed consent ; Male female ≥18 year ; Histologically confirm invasive breast cancer stage IV disease ; If disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature confirm cytology histology . Documented amplification ErbB2 fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) primary metastatic tumor tissue central laboratory randomization study ; If taxane administer neoadjuvant adjuvant setting , progression must occur &gt; 12 month completion treatment patient recover associated toxicity ; Measurable lesion ( ) accord RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) ; Radiotherapy palliative treatment painful metastatic disease permit must stop within 2 week prior initiation investigational treatment . All subject must recover radiotherapy related toxicity prior initiation investigational treatment . The site radiotherapy must use site measurable disease ; Bisphosphonate therapy bone metastases allow ; however , treatment must initiate prior first dose investigational treatment . Prophylactic use bisphosphonates subject without bone disease permit , except treatment osteoporosis ; For patient whose disease ER+ and/or PR+ follow criterion meet : Patients visceral disease require chemotherapy ( eg. , patient liver lung metastasis ) Rapidly progress life threaten disease , determine investigator Patients receive hormonal therapy longer benefit therapy hormonal treatment must stop first dose investigational treatment ; Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram . MUGA scan accept case echocardiogram perform inconclusive ; ECOG Performance Status 0 1 ; Life expectancy ≥ 12 week ; Able swallow retain oral medication ; Archived tumor tissue available testing ; Women men potential child must willing practice acceptable method birth control study ; Willing complete screening assessment outline protocol ; Adequate organ function define Table 1 Baseline Laboratory Values ; Pregnant lactate female anytime study Subjects nonmeasurable metastatic site disease per RECIST , ( e.g . bone metastasis , pleural effusion , ascites , etc . ( Refer Section 5.3 Efficacy list site consider nonmeasurable disease . ) ; Received prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , antiErbB1/ErbB2 therapy metastatic disease . Prior therapy ErbB1 and/or ErbB2 inhibitor , trastuzumab adjuvant setting . If trastuzumab administer adjuvant setting , &gt; 12 month must elapse since completion trastuzumab therapy ; Planned concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy ) take investigational treatment ; Unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug and/or prior cancer treatment ; Peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 great ; Malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . Subjects ulcerative colitis also exclude ; History malignancy . However , subject diseasefree 5 year , subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma , eligible ; Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation , serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety ; Uncontrolled infection ; Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent ; Known history uncontrolled symptomatic angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ; Known history clinical evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases leptomeningeal carcinomatosis ; Concurrent treatment prohibit medication , include herbal remedy Chinese traditional medicine ; Concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial involve investigational agent ; Used investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose investigational treatment ; Known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate paclitaxel lapatinib excipients .</criteria>
