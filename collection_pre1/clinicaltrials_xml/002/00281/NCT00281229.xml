	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether lung individual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) contain resident memory T lymphocytes produce combination cytokine induce symptom acute exacerbation COPD ( AE-COPD ) . Specifically , study determine cell-surface receptor lung T cell comparison blood T cell subject , examine anti-CD3-activated blood lung T cell interleukin ( IL ) -6 interferon-gamma production response IL-18 , IL-17A production response recombinant IL-23 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : COPD one press healthcare problem face nation . AE-COPD responsible bulk healthcare cost , much morbidity decline health status among individual common disease . The lack accept animal model AE-COPD necessitates novel approach use human sample . Advances understand pathogenesis slow , part , due controversy exacerbation define . The prevail paradigm define AE-COPD event-based . Such definition clearly identify group patient accelerated loss pulmonary function increase mortality . However , limited data show symptom-based definition AE-COPD also capture episodes induce significant morbidity functional decline , hence concern patient . Fundamental mechanism lack explain AE-COPD define either mean . Controversy also surround trigger AE-COPD . Bacteria viruses involve episode , relative importance intertwine dispute definition AE-COPD . Progress link specific pathogen molecular pathogenesis slow , due diversity , high rate bacterial colonization patient COPD , even stable state . Moreover , many AE-COPD case , pathogen identify . Without negate value analyze infection specific specie pathogen , appear progress molecular pathogenesis could accelerate focus unifying feature pulmonary immune response AE-COPD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The research protocol involve isolate lung lymphocytes surgical specimen patient already undergo clinically indicate lung resection . Surgical lung resection may perform either open thoracotomy video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) , could include pneumonectomy , lobectomy , wedge-excisions , dictate clinical care patient . This protocol exclusively use tissue excess clinical diagnosis establish . The set operating room Ann Arbor VA Hospital University Michigan Hospital System . Subjects recruit outpatient clinic , inpatient time surgery . Subjects undergo additional procedure beyond routine clinical care result participate protocol . However , anticipate study access medical record extract result demographic data , include occupational exposure smoke history , pulmonary function testing , result image stag study .</detailed_description>
