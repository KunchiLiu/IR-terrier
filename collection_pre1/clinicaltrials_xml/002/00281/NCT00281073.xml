	<brief_summary>This sequential phase 1 phase 2 study evaluate efficacy intracardiac echocardiography detect septal leave atrial pathology compare transesophageal echocardiography ( Phase 1 ) value management strategy immediate cardioversion cardiac catheterization procedure patient atrial fibrillation compare conventional strategy delay cardioversion till full anticoagulation establish three week ( Phase 2 ) . Phase 1 enroll 100 patient 12 center ; patient undergo clinically indicate TEE &amp; cardiac catheterization procedure . After review Phase 1 result independent DSMB &amp; investigator establish efficacy ICE , Phase 2 initiate . Phase 2 enroll 300 patient 15 center ; patient atrial fibrillation undergo clinically indicate cardiac catheterization procedure clinical indication cardioversion . Patients randomized ICE guide cardioversion strategy conventional strategy employ three week full anticoagulation cardioversion . ICE image use identify low risk group immediate cardioversion . A composite primary study endpoint include mortality major morbidity include stroke bleeding complication use . This study examine two hypothesis AF patient undergo invasive cardiac procedure : Hypothesis 1 : That ICE comparable efficacy TEE visualization leave atrial pathology septal defect predispose patient stroke . This evaluated Phase I component study . Hypothesis 2 : That ICE identify low risk patient immediate cardioversion procedure safe comparably effective electrical cardioversion perform base conventional strategy minimum 3 week precede anticoagulation therapy . Low risk patient expect acceptably low incidence rate stroke , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , peripheral embolism , major hemorrhagic event follow electrical cardioversion . This evaluated Phase II component study , Phase I objective achieve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The presence intra-atrial thrombus precursor propensity systemic embolism presence interatrial septal defect major concern patient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) undergo cardioversion . Transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) demonstrate sensitive tool detect septal defect , leave atrial thrombus spontaneous echo contrast ( 1 , 2,3 ) . The ACUTE trial document TEE base exclusion intra cardiac thrombus , smoke spontaneous echo contrast facilitate safe immediate cardioversion patient AF . ( 4 ) This trial demonstrate comparable risk embolic event TEE- base strategy identify low risk patient immediate cardioversion compare conventional strategy 3 week anticoagulation cardioversion . The recognition systemic thromboembolism significant potential complication cardioversion interventional cardiology procedure patient AF stimulate interest clinical evaluation catheter base intra cardiac echocardiography ( ICE ) . Initial experience intra cardiac phase -array imaging demonstrate efficacy feasibility technology intracardiac application capability high resolution image endocardial structure . ( 5 ) In recent time , utility image modality various interventional procedure investigate effectiveness visualize leave atrial thrombus ablative procedure demonstrate observational study . ( 6 -11 ) However , prospective multicenter comparative study two image technique unavailable . Should ICE provide comparable image capability TEE , value ICE guide cardioversion invasive procedure also systematically study prospective multicenter clinical study . The ICE CHIP study prospective open label randomize multi-center investigation perform two phase design initially compare two distinct image modality ( Phase 1 ) subsequently two different strategy ( ICE guide Cardioversion Conventional ) management AF patient undergo invasive cardiac procedure electrical cardioversion indicate ( Phase 2 ) . In Phase I , patient image TEE &amp; ICE core echo laboratory perform blind comparison two imaging modality . In Phase II , patient randomize one two treatment group . Investigators blind method management patient prior enrollment study . The composite incidence rate major cardiac bleeding complication ( stroke , TIA , peripheral embolism , major hemorrhagic event ) compare two treatment group duration study . In Phase 1 , 100 patient enrol 12 investigational center USA &amp; Europe . Study patient clinically indicated TEE procedure well invasive cardiac procedure . Recordings image method analyze independent blind manner core laboratory . It estimate enrollment take 3 month . In Phase 2 , total 300 patient ( 3:2 randomization ) enrol study 15 investigational site USA Europe . Patients AF require electrical cardioversion enrol study . The study last 8 week subject , estimate overall duration 12 month ( 8 month enrollment period , 2 month follow-up period , remain time close-out ) study . The pilot study design select order evaluate comparative accuracy ICE image TEE well feasibility ICE guide management AF . In Phase 1 , design ensure ICE image inferior standard TEE detection leave atrial pathology . In Phase 2 , ICE image perform patient prior immediate electrical cardioversion determine equivalent conventional management strategy electrical cardioversion anticoagulation 3 week prior cardioversion . Both Phase I Phase II study open label . An open label study design propose possible blind clinician , patient sponsor identity diagnostic technique Phase I ( ICE vs. TEE ) management strategy Phase II ( ICE vs . Conventional Strategy ) . The ICE TEE data analysis Phase I component core lab blind far identity patient , investigator center . In Phase II study , patient randomization treatment group minimize chance patient selection bias . An 8-week study duration choose Phase II component major cardiac bleeding complication occur within period .</detailed_description>
