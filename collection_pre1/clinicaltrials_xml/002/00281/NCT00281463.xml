	<detailed_description>Objectives : The purpose three phase study evaluate Pushrim Activated Power Assist Wheelchair ( PAPAW ) . Phase I examine whether steady-state , metabolic energy efficiency propel manual wheelchair without device significantly different . In Phase II , wheelchair user evaluate PAPAW activity daily live course determine usability acceptability identify area future development . Finally , phase III , comparison activity daily live community make subject use personal wheelchair PAPAW . Research Design : This repeated measure design type study , conduct different location phase : biomechanics laboratory , ADL drive course , participant ' home environment . Analyzed variable include : metabolic energy expenditure , stroke frequency , upper extremity joint range motion , participant response visual analog survey , average speed , actual daily drive time spend either wheelchair , daily distance travel . Subjects act control . Methodology : Full-time wheelchair user tetraplegia age 18 65 recruit study . They free pressure sore , free shoulder pain would prevent propel manual wheelchair , history cardiopulmonary disease . A maximum 50 subject ( fifteen Phase I II , 15 Phase III , five subject drop-out ) recruit . In Phase I , participant ask propel PAPAW wheelchair , attach wheelchair roller system three resistance condition . In Phase II , participant ask propel wheelchairs activity daily live . Finally , Phase III consist four-week trial include two-week test subject ' wheelchair ( i.e . chair trial ) two-week test provide PAPAW ( i.e . PAPAW trial ) . The order chair trial PAPAW trial randomize . Clinical Relationship : For individual tetraplegia , PAPAWs reduce energy demand , stroke frequency , overall joint range motion compare traditional manual wheelchair propulsion . In addition , PAPAWs potential improve functional capability certain activity daily live well community participation individual tetraplegia . Use device could help maintain overall physical capacity reduce risk pain injury upper extremity .</detailed_description>
