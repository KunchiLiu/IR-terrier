	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving bevacizumab together docetaxel radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together docetaxel radiation therapy work treat patient stage III stage IV head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab , Docetaxel , Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine time progression patient stage III IV squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat bevacizumab combination docetaxel radiotherapy . Secondary - Compare objective response rate , locoregional control rate , duration response , pattern failure , overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 8 week receive docetaxel IV 1 hour week 8 week . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 2 week 1 year . Approximately 8-10 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient may undergo neck dissection . Bevacizumab , stop 8 week surgery , may restart 4 week surgery continue 9 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
