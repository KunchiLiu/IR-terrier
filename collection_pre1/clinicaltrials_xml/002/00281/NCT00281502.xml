	<brief_summary>The study conduct two phase . Phase A evaluate contribution bacterial overgrowth colonic inertia development Hepatic Encephalopathy ( HE ) 50 ambulatory subject HE hepatitis C cirrhosis . This phase include Screening Evaluation Visit . Phase B evaluate effect rifaximin bacterial outgrowth severity HE 20 subject enrol Phase A somewhat great degree encephalopathy . The purpose study evaluate following : 1. relationship bacterial overgrowth presence severity HE patient hepatitis C cirrhosis ; 2. effectiveness tolerability rifaximin relative placebo treatment HE associate hepatitis C cirrhosis ; 3. relationship bacterial overgrowth presence severity HE rifaximin treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Bacterial Overgrowth Delayed Intestinal Transit Hepatic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic encephalopathy frequent occasionally refractory complication cirrhosis associate impaired quality life . Its severity may correlate parameter liver dysfunction . Although multiple pathogenic mechanism condition propose , include participation bacterial toxin , especially ammonia , produce gastrointestinal tract . Treatment option hepatic encephalopathy time limit lactulose neomycin . Lactulose frequently poorly tolerate , many patient non-compliant use . In patient renal insufficiency hepatic encephalopathy frequently problematic , use neomycin contraindicate due ototoxicity nephrotoxicity . Autonomic dysfunction common patient cirrhosis could contribute development hepatic encephalopathy impairment intestinal motility , lead bacterial overgrowth colonic inertia . The following question address : A . Is impaired intestinal transit bacterial overgrowth associate presence severity hepatic encephalopathy ? 50 patient undergo detailed clinical evaluation severity liver disease , hepatic encephalopathy assessment intestinal transit bacterial overgrowth radiographic marker study breath test analysis . Multivariate analysis perform determine relationship intestinal transit evidence bacterial overgrowth presence severity hepatic encephalopathy . B . Does treatment rifaximin improve bacterial overgrowth hepatic encephalopathy ? 20 patient population significant encephalopathy randomize receive either rifaximin placebo . Post-treatment evaluation severity hepatic encephalopathy breath test analysis bacterial overgrowth perform . The effect treatment change hepatic encephalopathy bacterial overgrowth relationship change bacterial overgrowth severity hepatic encephalopathy also assess . Phase A Endpoints : Degree bacterial overgrowth correlation grade hepatic encephalopathy ( present ) . Phase B Endpoints : To demonstrate improvement degree HE treatment Rifaximin Efficacy Endpoints The primary efficacy endpoint Phase B study change baseline proportion patient HE , minimal HE ( symptom , abnormal psychometric test ) , mild persistent HE ( mild symptom ) , persistent Stage II HE ( presence asterixis , history hospitalization spontaneous Stage III IV HE ) . Secondary efficacy endpoint Phase B follow : To demonstrate improvement intestinal transit time patient ( base Lactulose Hydrogen Breath Test ) To demonstrate improvement bacterial overgrowth , improve insomnia , flatulence , quality life . To demonstrate rifaximin improve patient ' symptom insomnia , flatulence , quality life measure degree bacterial overload impair intestinal transit time .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase A Subject 18 70 year age , inclusive . Subject cirrhosis due chronic HCV infection document : Subject evidence hepatic encephalopathy evidence : Neuropsychometric Testing ( Number Connection Test , Trails Test , etc . ) Subject nonazotemic ( creatinine &lt; 1.5mg/dL ) ambulatory screen . Subject cirrhosis due chronic HCV document : pathologic clinical radiographic evidence cirrhosis positive HCV RNA PCR level . Phase A Subject receive active interferon therapy within 2 week enrollment . Subject pregnant lactating . Subject life expectancy le 100 day . Subject history alcohol abuse within 6 month enrollment . Subject active gastrointestinal bleeding time enrollment . Subject use agent alters intestinal motility , eg , methadone , cholestyramine , tricyclic antidepressant . Subject unable take oral medication . Subject use neomycin antibiotic within 2 week enrollment actively use lactulose time enrollment . Subject take hypersensitivity allergy rifaximin rifampin . Subject require long term antibiotic therapy ( eg , Lyme Disease , tuberculosis ) . Subject know suspected alcohol abuse illicit drug use within 1 year enrollment . Subject participate investigational drug device study within 30 day prior randomization . Subject receive rifaximin within last 30 day . Subject concomitant disease condition could interfere , treatment could interfere conduct study , could opinion investigator increase risk AEs subject 's participation study . Subject unwilling unable comply study protocol reason . Subject diagnose form liver disease , include HIV HBV coinfection , determine history , serological parameter , histology available . Subject diagnose major psychiatric illness , chronic renal and/or respiratory insufficiency , intercurrent infection , treatment sedative within 7 day enrollment . Subject show presence intestinal obstruction inflammatory bowel disease , antacid cathartic within 12h study start ; antibiotic 7 day start dose ; treat encephalopathycausing agent . Subjects bad vision neurological disease since could difficulty complete neuropsychological assessment . Phase B Inclusion Criteria Subject successfully participate continue meet eligibility criterion require Phase A study base completion test , Breath Tests , Radiological Marker . Subject Number Connection Test score &gt; 50 sec time enrollment . Phase B Exclusion Criteria A subject eligible inclusion Phase B ( ) meet exclusion criterion Phase A study .</criteria>
