	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma serious chronic condition affect 14 million Americans . Data indicate rate asthma high certain population . In fact , African Americans Hispanics Northeast twice likely die asthma white . African Americans four time likely hospitalize asthma five time likely white seek care asthma emergency department . Reasons high rate certain , likely result interaction risk factor environmental exposure , genetic predisposition , access appropriate medical care , socioeconomic status , cultural health practice . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) support variety activity address press public health problem pose asthma . However , progress reduce disparity disappointingly slow . Separate , independent research project generate important clue understanding nature scope problem , coordinate , interdisciplinary , comprehensive approach research need . By foster partnership among minority medical center , research intensive institution , community asthma patient live , cooperative research center help increase capacity improve health outcome among minority economically disadvantage population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study comprise three group : pregnant woman asthma , child require intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission asthma , asthmatic require emergency care . In one part study , researcher randomly assign pregnant woman asthma African American Hispanic race/ethnicity one two culturally sensitive asthma education smoke cessation program . At time , investigator examine asthma-related morbidity large cohort pregnant asthmatic woman utilize administrative data vital record . Perceptions asthma severity way describe appear differ African Americans compare white . Therfore , asthmatic patient attend emergency room , along family , invite participate focus group validate culturally sensitive instrument allow improve descriptor asthma severity African Americans . Estimates patient asthma severity match objective measure , compare white . This methodology use extend hypothesis child admit severe asthma region 's pediatric ICU . In pediatric ICU , admission rate outcomes associate potentially important genetic variation beta 2 adrenergic receptor ( BADR2 ) . Using parent non-affected sibling case control , novel computational method test gene-gene interaction explain genetic basis asthma disparity severe asthma .</detailed_description>
