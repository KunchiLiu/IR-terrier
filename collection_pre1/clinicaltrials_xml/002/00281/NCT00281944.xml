	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose oxaliplatin give together leucovorin fluorouracil treat young patient advance solid tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oxaliplatin give together fluorouracil leucovorin calcium pediatric patient recurrent refractory solid tumor , include tumor CNS . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine pharmacokinetic property oxaliplatin pediatric patient population . II . Correlate alteration accumulation fludeoxyglucose F 18 tumor response patient readily undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) PET/CT scan . III . Assess safety profile regimen patient . IV . Evaluate preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study oxaliplatin . Patients stratify accord solid tumor type ( non-CNS v CNS ) . Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 follow fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1-2 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos oxaliplatin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . At least 6 patient treated MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
