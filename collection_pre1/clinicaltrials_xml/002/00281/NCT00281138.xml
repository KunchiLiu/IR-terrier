	<brief_title>Center Reducing Asthma Disparities - Rhode Island/Puerto Rico Centers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma serious chronic condition affect 14 million Americans , prevalence rate higher certain population ( e.g . 10 percent inner-cities 30 percent among homeless vs. 5 percent general population white ) . African Americans Hispanics Northeast twice likely die asthma white . African Americans four time likely hospitalize asthma five time likely white seek care asthma emergency department . Reasons high rate certain , likely result interaction risk factor environmental exposure , genetic predisposition , access appropriate medical care , socioeconomic status , cultural health practice . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute support variety activity address press public health problem pose asthma . However , progress reduce disparity disappointingly slow . Separate , independent research project generate important clue understanding nature scope problem . A coordinated , interdisciplinary comprehensive approach research need take advantage clue , move science faster , increase capacity improve health outcome among minority economically disadvantage population . Cooperative center research foster partnership among minority medical center , research intensive institution , community asthma patient live promote advancement . The Request Applications Centers Reducing Asthma Disparities release October , 2001 . The objective program promote partnership ( call Centers ) minority serve institution ( MSI ) may strong research program research intensive institution ( RII ) track record NIH-supported research patient care . The purpose partnership conduct collaborative research asthma disparity ( i.e . great prevalence asthma , high rate morbidity due asthma , less access use quality medical care among minority poor ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Rhode Island : Puerto Rico Asthma Center ( RIPRAC ) establish reduce disparity asthma among Latino child . Brown University faculty involve extensive pediatric asthma research program join epidemiologist , clinician , health service researcher minority serve University Puerto Rico study potentially overlook determinant disparity . A training component ( base successful T32 research train program ) involve individual site site . The Rhode Island : Puerto Rico Asthma Center include four project seek understand cause disparity multiple level : biomedical , individual/family , socioenvironmental level . The four project , respectively , 1 ) examine discrepancy diagnosis asthma assessed parental report , primary care medical record systematic diagnosis base NHLBI guideline ; 2 ) ass characteristic ( prescription practice , share decision making , continuity access care ) health care system may differentially affect asthma morbidity ; 3 ) evaluate family belief , burden asthma management medication adherence affect asthma morbidity health care utilization Latino Anglo child ; 4 ) study relation symptom perception pediatric asthma discrepancy . Subjects four project 300 mainland Anglos , 200 mainland Latinos ( Puerto Rican Dominican descent ) 400 island Puerto Rico child asthma , age 7-15 , thereby promote comparability efficiency . Chi-square analysis ANOVA 's used ass difference group ; technique logistic regression multiple regression use model effect covariates . The Center Training component provide clinical research education supervision Puerto Rican trainees faculty , enhance cultural awareness Brown personnel relate asthma disparity , launch least three trainee-led pilot research project area .</detailed_description>
