	<brief_summary>Guidelines continue list lopinavir/ritonavir preferred protease inhibitor-containing regimen HIV-infected individual . There recently increase interest daily therapy . While lopinavir/ritonavir recently approve daily therapy associate considerable diarrhea treat soft gel capsule . It hope alternative formulation lopinavir/ritonavir may provide similar pharmacokinetics improved tolerability . This include possibility use liquid newly release tablet . This study treat people tolerate current regimen four week formulation several assessment pharmacokinetics tolerability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter Study Assess Tolerability Once Daily Lopinavir/Ritonavir ( LPV/r ) Liquid Versus Capsules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design assess tolerability different form ( liquid , capsule tablet ) lopinavir/ritonavir give once-daily part combination therapy HIV infection . Study subject tolerate stable regimen HIV medication undetectable level HIV blood . They assign chance receive daily liquid soft gel capsule lopinavir/ritonavir four week . At time receive alternative formulation four week . They give daily lopinavir/ritonavir recently release tablet formulation . After four week formulation several assessment make overall tolerability drug . After four week tablets allow take whatever regimen want follow additional 36 week total duration study 48 week .
