	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma serious chronic condition affect 14 million Americans , prevalence rate higher certain population ( e.g . 10 % inner-cities 30 % among homeless versus 5 % general population white ) . African Americans Hispanics Northeast twice likely die asthma white . African Americans four time likely hospitalize asthma five time likely white seek care asthma emergency department . Reasons high rate certain , likely result interaction risk factor , environmental exposure , genetic predisposition , access appropriate medical care , socioeconomic status , cultural health practice . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute support variety activity address press public health problem pose asthma . However , progress reduce disparity disappointingly slow . Separate , independent research project generate important clue understanding nature scope problem . A coordinated , interdisciplinary comprehensive approach research need take advantage clue , move science faster , increase capacity improve health outcome among minority economically disadvantage population . Cooperative center research foster partnership among minority medical center , research intensive institution , community asthma patient live promote advancement . The Request Applications Centers Reducing Asthma Disparities release October 2001 . The objective program promote partnership ( call center ) minority serve institution ( MSI ) may strong research program research intensive institution ( RII ) track record NIH-supported research patient care . The purpose partnership conduct collaborative research asthma disparity ( i.e. , great prevalence asthma , high rate morbidity due asthma , less access use quality medical care among minority poor ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The project develop collaborative research program Northwestern University Feinberg School Medicine Cook County Hospital fully characterize relationship social stress , cop , self-regulatory health behavior context asthma disparity among African American low income population . Once characterized , project develop test intervention strategy reduce asthma disparity high-risk population base evidence-based model demonstrate success social work , nursing , community intervention . There four research aim center : ( 1 ) To develop validate culturally appropriate psychosocial instrument related underlying cause disparity asthma morbidity ; ( 2 ) To identify structural relationship psychosocial factor know influential factor related disparity asthma outcome ; ( 3 ) To study change structural relationship among influential factor asthma disparity time , relate change health status ; ( 4 ) To develop , pilot test , field test community-based asthma team ( peer coach , asthma nurse , social worker ) intervention enhance individual ability cope chronic illness improve asthma-related behavior . A second major goal Center train mentor new clinical investigator social scientist able conduct research field interest . The study completion date list record obtain `` Project End Date '' enter Query View Report ( QRV ) record .</detailed_description>
