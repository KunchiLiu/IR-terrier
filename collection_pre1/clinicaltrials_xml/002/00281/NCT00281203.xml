	<brief_summary>This study group form normal subject control group experiment design determine whether alveolar macrophage ( AMø ) patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) show abnormal responsiveness bacterial viral product . Specifically , study determine dose-response characteristic AMø production interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-18 , IL-23 ( pro-inflammatory cytokine ) stimulation purify lipopolysaccharide , synthetic lipopeptide ( PAM3-Cys ) , poly I : C. These stimulus mimic response Gram-negative bacteria , Gram-positive bacteria , RNA viruses , respectively . Results AMø healthy volunteer compare AMø COPD patient smoker ( ex-smokers ) normal pulmonary function ; sample obtain clinically indicated bronchoscopies separate consent form .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : COPD one press healthcare problem face nation . Acute exacerbation COPD ( AE-COPD ) responsible bulk healthcare cost , much morbidity decline health status among individual common disease . The lack accept animal model AE-COPD necessitates novel approach use human sample . Advances understand pathogenesis slow , part , due controversy exacerbation define . The prevail paradigm define AE-COPD event-based . Such definition clearly identify group patient accelerated loss pulmonary function increase mortality . However , limited data show symptom-based definition AE-COPD also capture episodes induce significant morbidity functional decline , hence concern patient . Fundamental mechanism lack explain AE-COPD define either mean . Controversy also surround trigger AE-COPD . Bacteria viruses involve episode , relative importance intertwine dispute definition AE-COPD . Progress link specific pathogen molecular pathogenesis slow , due diversity , high rate bacterial colonization patient COPD , even stable state . Moreover , many AE-COPD case , pathogen identify . Without negate value analyze infection specific specie pathogen , appear progress molecular pathogenesis could accelerate focus unifying feature pulmonary immune response AE-COPD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Bronchoscopies perform healthy volunteer . Subjects reimburse $ 30 initial visit $ 150 completion bronchoscopy help defray travel expense time spend participate volunteer .</detailed_description>
