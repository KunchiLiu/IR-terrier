	<brief_title>Center Reducing Asthma Disparities - Harvard University/Boston Area Community Health Centers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma serious chronic condition affect 14 million Americans , prevalence rate higher certain population ( e.g . 10 percent inner-cities 30 percent among homeless vs. 5 percent general population white ) . African Americans Hispanics Northeast twice likely die asthma white . African Americans four time likely hospitalize asthma five time likely white seek care asthma emergency department . Reasons high rate certain , likely result interaction risk factor environmental exposure , genetic predisposition , access appropriate medical care , socioeconomic status , cultural health practice . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute support variety activity address press public health problem pose asthma . However , progress reduce disparity disappointingly slow . Separate , independent research project generate important clue understanding nature scope problem . A coordinated , interdisciplinary comprehensive approach research need take advantage clue , move science faster , increase capacity improve health outcome among minority economically disadvantage population . Cooperative center research foster partnership among minority medical center , research intensive institution , community asthma patient live promote advancement . The Request Applications Centers Reducing Asthma Disparities release October , 2001 . The objective program promote partnership ( call Centers ) minority serve institution ( MSI ) may strong research program research intensive institution ( RII ) track record NIH-supported research patient care . The purpose partnership conduct collaborative research asthma disparity ( i.e . great prevalence asthma , high rate morbidity due asthma , less access use quality medical care among minority poor ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Center Reducing Asthma Disparities involve partnership researcher Harvard University ( Channing Laboratory , Brigham Women 's Hospital , Harvard School Public Health ) network Boston-area Community Health Centers ( CHCs ) affiliate non-profit community-based organization CCHERS ( Center Community Health Education , Research Service ) . Broad specific aim : 1 . Conduct community need assessment ass difference perception asthma etiology , disparity , effective treatment community representative , Community Health Center patient , Community Health Center provider . 2 . Determine role socio/environmental exposure ( psychosocial stress , indoor allergen , cigarette smoke diesel-related air pollutant ) asthma onset study prenatally enrol birth cohort . 3 . Determine role genetics modify risk social/physical environment concurrent assessment follow genetic factor think influence immune development airway inflammation early life : stress ( corticosteroid regulatory gene , adrenergic system regulatory gene ) , diesel exhaust smoking ( biotransformation gene ) , indoor allergen ( cytokine pathway gene ) . 4 . Use quasi-experimental design evaluate effectiveness research , training , outreach component project lead significant change ability particular stakeholder design implement sound asthma intervention strategy . 5 . Develop train program Harvard provide master predoctoral student well postdoctoral fellow experience expertise Community-Based Participatory Research ( CBPR ) focus reduce asthma disparity . 6 . Develop train information dissemination material health center staff community member ( especially caregiver child asthma ) . The Center Community Health Education , Research Service take lead implement Specific Aims 1 , 4 6 , Harvard group take lead Aims 2 , 3 5 . In addition building need infrastructure support partnership-based research intervention aim reduce health disparity , proposal potential make significant contribution scientific literature respect health disparity asthma .</detailed_description>
