	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether statistical association change sputum serial level two cytokine , interleukin ( IL ) -17 IL-6 , treatment course severe acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AE-COPD ) clinical course ( i.e. , rate recovery potential complicate course ) . AE-COPD defined episode require emergency room ( ER ) evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : COPD one press healthcare problem face nation . AE-COPD responsible bulk healthcare cost , much morbidity decline health status among individual common disease . The lack accept animal model AE-COPD necessitates novel approach use human sample . Advances understand pathogenesis slow , part , due controversy exacerbation define . The prevail paradigm define AE-COPD event-based . Such definition clearly identify group patient accelerated loss pulmonary function increase mortality . However , limited data show symptom-based definition AE-COPD also capture episodes induce significant morbidity functional decline , hence concern patient . Fundamental mechanism lack explain AE-COPD define either mean . Controversy also surround trigger AE-COPD . Bacteria viruses involve episode , relative importance intertwine dispute definition AE-COPD . Progress link specific pathogen molecular pathogenesis slow , due diversity , high rate bacterial colonization patient COPD , even stable state . Moreover , many AE-COPD case , pathogen identify . Without negate value analyze infection specific specie pathogen , appear progress molecular pathogenesis could accelerate focus unifying feature pulmonary immune response AE-COPD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The research protocol involve prospective , observational analysis . Participants include acutely ill COPD patient AE-COPD enrol ER evaluation hospitalization Ann Arbor VA Hospital University Michigan Health Systems ER , clinic , ward . All non-study diagnostic testing , decision discharge ER admit hospital , prescription medication , non-study follow-up leave discretion primary caregiver . Participants either anticipate discharge usual residence ER enrol still ER . Participants discharge usual residence may contact telephone enrol 24 hour later , willing return Medical Center study initiation . Hospitalized patient enrol within first 48 hour . Study physicians coordinator call capture people presentation , prior steroid antibiotic , possible . However , clinically indicate treatment delay permit enrollment collection research sample . Participants question status five respiratory symptom ( dyspnea , cough , sputum production , sputum viscosity , sputum purulence ) use publish Respiratory Symptom score instrument . Each symptom score severity use follow three-point scale : 1 ) Usual level ; 2 ) Somewhat bad usual ; 3 ) Much bad usual . An acute exacerbation chronic bronchitis ( AECB ) define symptomatically minor worsening ( score 2 ) two symptom , major worsening ( score 3 ) one symptom . A clinical score generate use previously use system ( Chest 2000 ; 118:1557-1565 ) 10 clinical parameter assess ( overall feeling well-being , dyspnea , cough , sputum production , sputum viscosity , sputum purulence , overall appearance , respiratory rate , wheezing , rale ) ; severity parameter score use three-point scale . Thus score range 10 30 . The following additional data obtain : vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , temperature , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation level ) ; dyspnea assessment ( MMRC &amp; University California San Diego SOBQ ) ; estimate daily sputum production last 72 hour ; sputum color ( use standardize color `` paint-chip '' scale ) ; change medication usage , special attention elicit history increase use potent inhaled steroid , patient-initiated use oral steroid antibiotic . If fever focal finding chest examination , chest X-ray obtain part usual clinical care . Sputum blood sample collect measurement IL-6 IL-17 level time 0 ER hospital , 5-7 day , 10-12 day , 33-35 day , 56-58 day later . Specimens may obtain participant require mechanical ventilation first 24 hour intubation , suspect pneumonia . Subjects reimburse $ 25 per schedule return visit follow hospital discharge help defray travel expense .</detailed_description>
