	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether statistical association change baseline level two cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -17A IL-6 sputum patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) severity acute exacerbation COPD ( AE-COPD ) . These sputum cytokine level take measure adaptive immune response ( IL-17A ) innate immune response ( IL-6 ) , respectively . Sputum collect either spontaneously obtain induction ; cytokine level measure ELISA . The primary analysis , comparison sputum cytokine level clinical state , do use random effect model .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : COPD one press healthcare problem face nation . AE-COPD responsible bulk healthcare cost much morbidity decline health status among individual common disease . The lack accept animal model AE-COPD necessitates novel approach use human sample . Advances understand pathogenesis slow , part , due controversy exacerbation define . The prevail paradigm define AE-COPD event-based . Such definition clearly identify group patient accelerated loss pulmonary function increase mortality . However , limited data show symptom-based definition AE-COPD also capture episodes induce significant morbidity functional decline , hence concern patient . Fundamental mechanism lack explain AE-COPD define either mean . Controversy also surround trigger AE-COPD . Bacteria viruses involve episode , relative importance intertwine dispute definition AE-COPD . Progress link specific pathogen molecular pathogenesis slow , due diversity , high rate bacterial colonization patient COPD , even stable state . Moreover , many AE-COPD case , pathogen identify . Without negate value analyze infection specific specie pathogen , appear progress molecular pathogenesis could accelerate focus unifying feature pulmonary immune response AE-COPD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A prospective patient cohort study extensively physiologically , functionally , immunologically upon enrollment stable state . As part study , participant train use peak flow meter , record daily first morning peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) . To confirm range fluctuation basal state , participant follow three-month interval face-to-face interview limit physiological functional testing describe . Participants also remind scheduled visit contact study coordinator feel AE-COPD may present . If contact study coordinator , evaluate one study sit within 48 hour . A diagnosis AE-COPD incorporate modification definition use COPD Clinical Research Network ( CCRN ) . The diagnosis make one two way : severe AE-COPD define change respiratory symptom participant 's baseline measurement plus evaluation emergency room ( ER ) require hospitalization ; mild-to-moderate AE-COPD define change respiratory symptom participant 's baseline measurement require change therapy ( addition either antibiotic , oral steroid , ) , without evaluation ER hospitalization . In latter case , therapy could change either advice patient 's caregiver study physician base clinical judgment , could self-initiated case participant authorize caregiver . A concerted effort make capture milder AE-COPD winter non-winter season . Upon enrol participant , follow perform : review medical history ; review demographic smoke history ; physical examination , blood sputum collection ; six-minute walk test ; questionnaires assess shortness breath ( MMRC University California San Diego SOBQ ) , sputum production ( modify Chronic Bronchitis Symptom Questionnaire ) , health status ( SF-36 St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ) , psychological trait ( Hospital Anxiety/Depression Score , Illness Perception Questionnaire , Coping Index , individualize 30-minute clinical interview via telephone ) . Participants attend study visit every 3 month review symptom . During AE-COPD ( episode acute bronchitis ) , sputum blood collect , five-symptom questionnaire fill . Subjects reimburse $ 25 per schedule visit $ 50 per unscheduled visit ( time perceive exacerbation ) help defray travel expense .</detailed_description>
