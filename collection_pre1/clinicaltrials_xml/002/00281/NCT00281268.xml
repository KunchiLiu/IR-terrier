	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Adult respiratory distress syndrome affect approximately 150,000 people United States year . Despite twenty year research mechanism cause syndrome numerous development technology mechanical ventilation , mortality remain great 50 percent . Many patient young , addition tragic loss human life , add cost society patient spend average two week intensive care unit require multiple high tech procedure . Because overwhelming nature lung injury establish , prevention would appear effective strategy improve outlook condition . Basic research identify numerous inflammatory pathway associate development ARDS . Agents block mediator prolong survival animal lung injury , test patient . Because large number putative mediator variety way action block , possibility new drug development almost infinite . This exciting prospect , since envisions first effective pharmacologic treatment ARDS . However , preliminary clinical study show conflict result , urgent need mechanism efficiently effectively test new drug ARDS . Treatment study patient ARDS difficult perform three reason . The complicated clinical picture make difficult accumulate large number comparable patient one center . There agreement optimal supportive care critically ill patient . Many patient meet study criterion enrol study protocol acute nature disease process . For reason , therapeutic trial ARDS require multicenter cooperation . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Network investigator develop plan new protocol ass Pulmonary Artery Catheter management tool ARDS . The new study prompt recommendation FDA/NIH Pulmonary Artery Catheter Clinical Outcomes workshop convene August 1997 response concern medical community regard clinical benefit safety pulmonary artery catheter . The new protocol Fluids Catheters Treatment Trial ( FACTT ) two two factorial design compare patient receive PAC central venous catheter ( CVC ) one two fluid management strategy ( conservative vs. liberal ) . The randomized , multicenter trial design include 1000 patient . The primary endpoint mortality 60 day . Secondary endpoint include ventilator free day organ failure free day .</detailed_description>
