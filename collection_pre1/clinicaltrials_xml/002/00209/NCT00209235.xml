	<brief_summary>We , researcher , find growth hormone deficiency common patient pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a , fall broad condition term Albright hereditary osteodystrophy . Patients pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a typically short obese . Some patient short childhood , due combination factor , end short adult . We evaluate effect growth hormone treatment patient pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a find growth hormone deficient . We hypothesize growth hormone deficiency may contribute short stature obesity find condition . We also evaluate effect growth hormone patient pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a growth hormone deficient ( i.e. , growth hormone sufficient ) study drug R01 FD003409 meet criterion idiopathic short stature SGA . We also evaluate neurocognitive psychosocial functioning participant AHO order determine specific impairment common condition determine best approach toward management . Funding source -- Growth hormone study : FDA OOPD [ R01 FD003409 ( end ) R01 FD002568 ( end ) ] Cognitive/behavior : NICHD R21 HD078864</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a ( PHP1a ) disorder cause many endocrine developmental problem . To date , medical treatment focus primarily maintenance normal serum level calcium , phosphorous , thyroid hormone . However , therapeutic intervention address problem short stature , obesity , subcutaneous ossification , many source considerable morbidity personal distress . These patient require frequent medical care , blood test , medication adjustment . PHP1a inherited condition estimate prevalence United States 1:15,000- 20,000 , study propose provide opportunity improve quality life affect patient . We find growth hormone ( GH ) deficiency common patient , data suggest GH test part routine standard care . We investigate whether GH treatment increase linear growth velocity final adult height child . We also investigate whether GH treatment reduce weight improve variety metabolic disturbance overall health child adult . GH deficiency lead short stature obesity , also osteoporosis , hyperlipidemia , depressed cardiac renal function , well overall lack energy . It quite possible treatment GH-deficient patient PHP1a could improve problem . GH treatment FDA approve use child adult GH deficiency . Therefore , may possible provide improvement health overall quality life patient . Additionally , initiate research study treat child PHP1a GH deficient ( i.e. , GH sufficient ) . The rationale GH treatment could maximize linear growth velocity prior premature bone fusion occur condition potentially improve final adult height . The supply growth hormone end study , follow participant study receive growth hormone supply . This study also seek define specific neurocognitive psychosocial disability individual AHO order develop therapy improve quality life .</detailed_description>
