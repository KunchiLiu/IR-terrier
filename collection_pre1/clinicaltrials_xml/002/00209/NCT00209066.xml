	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate alteration sympathetic tone patient major depression without ischemic heart disease reevaluate patient 8 treatment electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . We expect support hypothesis HRV pathophysiologically associate state major depression . We hypothesize follow : 1 . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) decrease prior treatment depression comparison post-treatment measure HRV . 2 . After 8 treatment ECT , HRV increase basal condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There considerable evidence patient ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) concurrent major depression less favorable prognosis patient IHD alone . Indeed , number recent study implicate major depression pathophysiologic progression cardiovascular disease independent risk factor , rather reaction cardiovascular illness . This conclusion support multiple recent study ( Anda et al ; 1993 ; Markowitz Matthews , 1991 ; Musselman et al. , 1994 , 1995 ) . Increased sympathetic tone subsequent diminish heart rate variability secondary elevate circulating level catecholamine provide possible pathophysiologic link IHD depression . For example , Carney et al ( 1988 ) establish correlation increase heart rate decrease heart rate variability ( HRV ) patient major depression IHD . Thus follow enhancement sympathetic tone may important independent development IHD major depression . The interplay among system remains investigated . The present study seek determine relationship major depression sympathetic tone . The primary objective Research Protocol determine effect major depressive disorder ( MDD ) ( see Specific Aim 1 ) , treatment , autonomic function ( see Specific Aim 2 ) . Twenty-five depressed patient 25 depressed patient without history ischemic cardiovascular disease recruit study . To determine whether exaggerated platelet reactivity diminish HRV exhibit depressed patient affect treatment ECT . Autonomic function depress patient study longitudinally ECT . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) depress patient exhibit therapeutic response ECT exhibit diminished HRV prior treatment support hypothesis HRV pathophysiologically associate state major depression . Successful ECT treatment depress mood associate normalization HRV may indicate : ) HRV unrelated Major Depressive Disorder , b ) HRV may reflect pre-existing `` trait '' phenomenon major depressive disorder , c ) directly improve HRV .</detailed_description>
