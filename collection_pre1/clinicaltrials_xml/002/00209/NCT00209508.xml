	<brief_summary>This study design ass whether GPI 1485 ability delay stop disease progression improve symptom patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) already treat dopamine agonist therapy . Whether drug work assess evaluate clinical endpoint UPDRS score evaluate image , obtain SPECT scan , brain activity . Participants study give either placebo GPI 1485 treatment . The duration study 2-years patient require complete 12 safety visit 3 SPECT scan . SPECT scan take , 1-year , 2-years treatment GPI 1485 . In complete SPECT scan , patient inject radioactive investigational drug b-CIT picture take use Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) camera .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In phase II study , investigational new drug ( approved FDA ) GPI 1485 assess ability delay stop disease progression improve symptom patient mild moderate Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . These potential effect GPI 1485 base animal study drug show protect nerve damage regrow damage nerve . Participants study randomly assign receive either GPI 1485 placebo ( inactive pill ) . GPI 1485 supply oral tablet formulation participant enrol study . Participants randomly assign receive GPI 1485 require take four tablet four time day mouth . GPI 1485 match placebo also supply oral tablet formulation . Participants randomly assign placebo require take four placebo tablet four time day mouth . The duration study 24 month include 12 clinical visit one 21 participate site three image visit Molecular NeuroImaging ( MNI ) New Haven Connecticut . At MNI , participant inject radioactive investigational drug b-CIT obtain image activity brain Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) . This evaluate whether GPI 1485 slow delay loss brain activity patient mild moderate PD . During study also clinical evaluation include physical exam , blood work , ECG ( trace heart rhythm ) , urinalysis . Tests specific Parkinson 's disease also perform include : Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , Dyskinesia Rating Scale , Bilateral finger-tapping test , Parkinson 's Disease Sleep Scale ( PDSS ) . In addition assessment health mood do .</detailed_description>
