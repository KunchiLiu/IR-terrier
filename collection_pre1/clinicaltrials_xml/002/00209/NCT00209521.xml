	<brief_title>Comparison AQUAVAN® Injection DISOPRIVAN® Injectable Emulsion Anesthesia During Coronary Artery Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , open-label , single-center , randomized clinical trial design examine efficacy tolerability AQUAVAN® Injection ( hereafter , refer AQUAVAN ) use preoperatively sedate , induce , maintain general anesthesia postoperatively sedate patient undergo elective coronary artery surgery . Eligible patient randomize either AQUAVAN DISOPRIVAN® Injectable Emulsion ( hereafter , refer DISOPRIVAN ) follow screen prior arrival surgical suite . On day surgery , administration 0.5 mg/kg bolus dose lignocaine , preoperative sedation begin use target-controlled infusion ( TCI ) system target desire sedation plasma concentration either AQUAVAN DISOPRIVAN , depend randomization schedule . The Bispectral ( BIS ) Index use guide study drug administration ; target BIS range 60 80 sedation 40 60 maintenance anesthesia . Adequate sedative/hypnotic effect surgical anesthesia characterize portion time within target BIS Index range versus total surgical time . Following , postsurgical sedation , inadequate sedative/hypnotic effect characterize number , duration , magnitude BIS score outside target range versus total postsurgical sedation time . During postsurgical sedation , Modified Ramsey Scale use additional clinical tool evaluate state sedation , attempt maintain score 3 5 . The overall quality induction , maintenance ease control anesthesia , quality sedation cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , grade anesthesiologist . Continuous monitor blood pressure heart rate use ass hemodynamic effect study drug . Hypertension hypotension define excursion &gt; /= 20 % baseline value .</detailed_description>
