	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) examination similar Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) use magnetic field contrast medium need visualize blood flow arterial vessel throughout body . Gadodiamide , contrast medium , already approve use image blood vessel directly inject vein , procedure formally test image aorto-iliac vessel use MR . The study design determine presence absence relevant stenosis ( ie great than/equal 50 % ) occlusion aorto-iliac artery . Intra-arterial Digital Subtraction Angiography ( IADSA ) use standard truth .</brief_summary>
