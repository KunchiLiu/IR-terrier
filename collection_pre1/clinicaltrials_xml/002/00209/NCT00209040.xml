	<detailed_description>Title addendum : fear potentiation , conditional discrimination , fear inhibition posttraumatic stress disorder . Principal Investigator : Erica Duncan , M.D . Co-Investigator : Seth Norrholm , M.D . Background : Fear potentiation acoustic startle response ( ASR ) demonstrate animal human ( Davis et al. , 1993 ; Grillon et al. , 1991 ) . The neural correlate fear potentiate startle well study ( Davis et al. , 1993 ) paradigm face validity cardinal symptom posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Central clinical problem PTSD inability patient inhibit fear stimuli reminiscent traumatic experience , even safe condition . The elucidation mechanism fear inhibition may abnormal patient potential advance development effective treatment patient . Two conditioning paradigm would permit study fear inhibition , potential confounds complicate interpretation result . Extinction paradigm problem stimulus cause excitation response later inhibition response , difficult tease apart whether give experimental manipulation enhances extinction increase inhibition disrupt excitation . Conditioned inhibition ( use A+/AX- paradigm ) advantage two separate stimulus excitation inhibition ( A excitatory ; X inhibitory ) , disadvantage potential second-order conditioning ( i.e. , possible A second-order condition X ) , greatly complicate separation excitation inhibition . The Davis lab recently develop discrimination procedure avoids problem allow independent evaluation excitation inhibition fear conditioning . The procedure , refer conditional discrimination ( abbreviated AX+/BX- ) , base paradigm use earlier learn theory experiment ( Rescorla Wagner , 1972 ; Bouton Swartzentruber , 1986 ) . In experiment , response X conditional upon presence either A B . A become excitatory train subject learn A X present together predicts unconditioned stimulus ( US ) . B become inhibitory B present X predicts safety US . The presentation AB result reduce response compare response A alone B inhibitory . Accordingly , novel stimulus , C , pair A result great response compare AB . X become excitatory degree B inhibitory . Testing paradigm rat Davis lab produce data good accord predict value ( see Figure 1 Appendix ) , indeed allow independent evaluation excitatory inhibitory process within condition test session . To date , paradigm well studied human subject . The translation paradigm human subject would present important advance methodology study neurobiology fear inhibition clinical population anxiety disorder PTSD . Specific Aims : 1 . To establish methodology assess baseline acoustic startle , fear potentiation acoustic startle classical conditioning paradigm , conditional discrimination ( AX+/BX- ) 15 normal control subject . Fear extinction assess one three separate repeat experimental session . 2 . To compare 15 subject PTSD , 15 subject history combat exposure PTSD , 15 normal control use acoustic startle methodology . We hypothesize PTSD subject normal baseline startle , intact fear potentiation , impaired inhibition fear potentiation measure AX+/BX- paradigm . We predict combat control result intermediate PTSD subject normal . Methods Subjects : 75 subject PTSD age 18-80 , 75 age gender match normal control , 75 age gender match subject combat history PTSD recruit . Subjects screen excluded Axis I II disorder ( PTSD patient group ) , significant medical illness , auditory visual impairment . Assessment : PTSD subject rat current psychopathology Clinician Administered PTSD Scale Mississippi Scale Combat-Related PTSD . In addition , PTSD subject combat control rat severity combat exposure Combat Exposure Scale . In subject , childhood trauma assess Early Trauma Inventory . Current depression anxiety symptom assess use Hamilton Depression Hamilton Anxiety scale , respectively . Attention distractibility assess mean Continuous Performance Test , motor function assess Finger Tapping Test . Cognitive function assess Benton Visual Retention Test , California Verbal Learning Test , Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence , Wechsler Memory Scale , Selective Reminding Test , Trails Test . Results test use covariates analysis condition data order control potential group difference attention memory . Total time assessment four five hour . Procedure : Acoustic stimulus deliver binaurally headphone ( Maico , TDH39P ) . Acoustic startle stimuli 40 m 116 dB white noise burst near instantaneous rise time deliver computerized electromyographic ( EMG ) startle response monitoring system ( SR-LAB , San Diego Instruments ) . The eyeblink component acoustic startle response measure via EMG right orbicularis oculi muscle . EMG activity amplify digitize use SR-LAB ( San Diego Instruments ) . According method establish Davis Grillon ( Grillon et al. , 1991 ; Grillon Ameli , 1998 ) , aversive stimulus ( US ) 40-250 m airblasts intensity 100 psi direct larynx , emit compressed air tank attach polyethylene tube control solenoid switch . A , B , C , X green , purple , orange , blue light ( counterbalance color assignment across subject ) picture . Subjects ask press button indicate learn discrimination different color light picture . The test session begin startle probe reduce initial startle reactivity rule nonstartlers . The training phase session consist trial stimuli A X pair US ( AX+ ) , trial stimuli B X pair US ( BX- ) . The test phase include startle probe alone presentation cue AB AC ( order counterbalance across subject ) . Between presentation AB AC , reinforce trial AX . Total time test session approximately 20 minute . Statistical Analysis : The basic approach mixed model ANOVA , use Diagnostic Group between-subjects factor ( Specific Aim 2 ) , within-subjects factor trial type ( Cue + Startle vs. Startle Alone ) , type cue ( AX , BX , AB , AC ) . Future Directions : This work coordinate series preclinical study plan Davis lab . The effect pharmacologic probe fear condition fear inhibition explore normal control potential method identify new pharmacologic treatment PTSD . Treatment effect fear condition inhibition study PTSD subject . Data current project serve pilot data future NIH R01 VA Merit Review grant submission .
