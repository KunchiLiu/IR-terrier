	<brief_summary>The aim study answer follow independent question treatment mantle cell lymphoma : - Can rituximab-fludarabine , cyclophosphamide ( R-FC ) improve reduction lymphoma mass compare rituximab-cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ( R-CHOP ) become new standard initial cytoreductive therapy ? - Can maintenance rituximab substitute interferon maintenance even improve progression free survival patient successful initial cytoreductive therapy ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy ( R-CHOP Vs. R-FC ) Followed Interferon Maintenance Versus Rituximab Maintenance MCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate two independent question treatment elderly patient mantle cell lymphoma : 1 . To test elderly patient advance mantle cell lymphoma , whether rituximab plus combination fludarabine cyclophosphamide ( 6 FC cycle ) result high reduction lymphoma mass measure percentage CR rituximab combine standard chemotherapy scheme ( 8 CHOP cycle ) . 2 . To compare maintenance therapy rituximab maintenance interferon-alpha pegylated interferon progression free survival , 2 different regimen induction chemo-immunotherapy elderly patient mantle cell lymphoma . This study perform prospective , randomize , open-label multicenter phase III trial . All patient randomize initial cytoreductive therapy R-FC R-CHOP . The parameter comparison R-FC R-CHOP percentage complete remission initial cytoreductive therapy . According known result R-FC R-CHOP lymphoma therapy , relevant difference R-CHOP R-FC overall response rate expect . For therapy overall response rate 90 % expect . Since well know prognosis patient reach least PR initial therapy poor , also necessary control parameter study . If unexpected relevant difference overall response rate observe study , initial randomisation stop patient assign superior therapy . In case CR rate important choice initial therapy . If relevant difference overall response rate observe , one side Fisher test perform end recruitment test whether rate CR 's R-FC significantly improve compare R-CHOP . The statistical parameter control overall response rate test CR rate choose follow way : The work significance level statistical evaluation part study set alpha=0.05 . The expected CR rate R-CHOP accord observation 50 % ; clinical relevant improvement R-FC would CR rate 65 % . Such improvement detect one side Fisher test power 95 % . According parameter 246 observation treatment would necessary . To control overall response rate , difference 85 % 95 % clinically relevant initial randomisation terminate probability 95 % . Overall response rate control restricted sequential procedure . Patients achieve least partial remission R-FC R-CHOP randomise interferon maintenance versus rituximab maintenance order evaluate impact maintenance therapy progression free survival . The improvement expect new maintenance rituximab progression free survival express reduction relative risk ( rr ) . Since risk reduction 60 % observed indolent lymphoma interferon maintenance , seem clinical relevant improvement new maintenance therapy . For work significance level alpha=0.05 power 95 % number event ( relapse death ) necessary two side fix sample trial 200 . During study progression free survival patient successful initial therapy monitor equivalent restrict sequential procedure maximum number 240 observation . In order evaluate impact initial therapy maintenance therapy overall survival patient , total follow 15 year study expect .</detailed_description>
