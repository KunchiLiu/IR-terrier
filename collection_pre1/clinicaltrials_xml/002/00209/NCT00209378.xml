	<brief_title>Citrate Versus Heparin Anticoagulation Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute renal failure occur 20 % critically ill patient associate increased morbidity mortality , spite modern renal replacement technique . The latter include continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) technique , necessitate anticoagulation blood enter extracorporeal circuit prevent premature clot formation hemofilter dysfunction . Heparin commonly use purpose , carry serious risk bleed complication heparin induce thrombocytopenia . In subgroup critically ill patient systemic anticoagulation absolutely contraindicate . Citrate-anticoagulant CVVH carry potential advantage less bleeding complication prolong filter survival , carry risk hypocalcaemia , citrate inappropriately insufficiently counteract calcium infusion passage blood filter . In addition , much citrate enters circulation , metabolic alkalosis may develop , since citrate convert bicarbonate liver . Moreover , continuous filtration technique may attenuate potentially harmful exaggerated immune response , particularly high volume filtration ( &gt; 6 L/h ) use . Also , type anticoagulation may modulate immune response , know biocompatibility study intermittent hemodialysis . In first part research proposal concern high bleeding risk patient comparison make prospective sequential cohort study anticoagulation citrate regard filter survival time , bleed risk , dialyser efficacy , circulate immune mediator ( neutrophil elastase myeloperoxidase , interleukin , platelet-activating factor , activate complement product , soluble cytokine receptor adhesion molecule ) , metabolic balance , acute renal failure duration . Also , filter survival time assess . The purpose second part current research proposal evaluate randomise controlled clinical trial 350 critically ill patient ( 18-80 year ) acute renal failure , ( 2 arm 175 patient ) , without increase bleeding risk ( thrombocytes &gt; 40 x 10^9/L , APTT &lt; 60 sec , PT-INR &lt; 2 ) whether citrate CVVH good bicarbonate-heparin CVVH term parameter first part study addition mortality primary endpoint . For purpose simple predilution system citrate adjustment protocol use compare standard heparin dosing . This replacement solution shall custom make , contain trisodium citrate , lactate bicarbonate , calcium low sodium content . Main objective : Investigation mortality continuous venovenous hemofiltration systemic anticoagulation heparin compare regional anticoagulation trisodium citrate also investigation filter survival . Our hypothesis , regional citrate anticoagulation replacement solution contain trisodium citrate , associate less bleeding complication compare heparin , also well filter survival . Most important want evaluate hypothesis treatment citrate result low mortality compare treatment systemic heparinization . Regional anticoagulation trisodium citrate may also potential effect immune response know biocompatibility study intermittent hemodialysis . Bioincompatibility lead polymorphonuclear cell degranulation indicate release intracellular granule product myeloperoxidase , lactoferrin , lysozyme elastase . Citrate anticoagulation may lead low polymorphonuclear cell degranulation , since cation play pivotal role process cell activation citrate create almost calcium-free environment within dialyser virtue chelate calcium . Primary endpoint : Mortality day 28 inclusion evaluate . Survival time first hemofilter use determine , include cause filter termination number filter use first 72 hour ; average filter patency time calculate . Citrate CVVH stop thus also study , patient fulfils one follow criterion : 1 . Total ionised calcium ratio 2.5 . 2 . Persistent metabolic alkalosis B.E . 10 . 3 . Clinical sign hypocalcaemia : tetanic symptom prolong QT interval 4 . Progressive non-lactic acidosis ( pH &lt; 7.20 ) CVVH combined increase anion gap ( &gt; 13 ) without presence endo- exogenous acid citrate suggest citrate accumulation Patients heparin develop HIT continue CVVH danaparoid anticoagulation . Patients heparin develop bleed episode continue CVVH regional citrate anticoagulation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients admit Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) require continuous venovenous hemofiltration . No high bleeding risk . A high bleeding risk define platelet count 40 x 10^9/L APTT 60 second PTINR 2.0 recent major bleed significant active bleeding i.e . requirement two unit pack red blood cell transfusion within 24 hour initiation CVVH . Less 18 80 year age . Patients administer heparin coumarins reason also exclude . Patients HIT know history also exclude .</criteria>
