	<brief_summary>The anticipation pain discomfort , diagnosis , intrinsic unknown make patient anxious prior procedure . Therefore , main goal sedation analgesia use various diagnostic , therapeutic , surgical procedure relieve anxiety , discomfort , pain , interrelate . The optimal level sedation give patient one allow patient tolerate procedure provide appropriate safety margin . This study design examine safety efficacy AQUAVAN® Injection versus commonly use approved sedative drug , midazolam HCl follow pretreatment fentanyl citrate injection ( pain relief ) produce sedation patient undergo single cardiac catheterization procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Efficacy AQUAVAN® Injection Sedation During Cardiac Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label study design ass safety efficacy AQUAVAN® Injection ( hereafter refer AQUAVAN ) versus reference drug , midazolam HCl ( hereafter refer midazolam ) follow pretreatment fentanyl citrate injection ( hereafter refer fentanyl ) produce sedation male female patient undergo single PC procedure . Screening assessment do within 2 week schedule procedure . After completion preprocedural sedation assessment , patient randomly assign 1 2 treatment group 3:1 ( AQUAVAN : midazolam ) allocation ratio day schedule procedure ( Day 0 ) via Interactive Voice Response System ( IVRS ) . Randomization stratify site . All patient , regardless treatment group assignment , receive fentanyl analgesic pretreatment . Supplemental dos fentanyl could administer patient report pain analgesia inadequate , demonstrate increased heart rate and/or blood pressure presence adequate sedation . At time fentanyl administer increase sedation level . AQUAVAN midazolam administer intravenous ( i.v . ) bolus induce state minimal-to-moderate ( procedural ) sedation , define score ≤4 Modified Observer 's Assessment Alertness/Sedation ( OAA/S ) scale . Supplemental dos administer , necessary , increase depth duration sedation . Supplemental dos administer Modified OAA/S score ≤2 purposeful response stimulation . Patient Investigator assessment use confirm depth sedation meet goal sedation , reduce anxiety , awareness . Follow-up patient assessment conduct telephone interview 24 hour follow treatment clinic visit 2 5 day follow treatment .</detailed_description>
