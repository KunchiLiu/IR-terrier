	<brief_title>SMART Trial Longitudinal Follow-Up : Off-Pump Versus On-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Surgical Management Arterial Revascularization Therapies ( SMART ) trial randomize , control , double blind trial design compare completeness revascularization , graft patency , clinical outcome , health-related quality life cost 200 unselected patient refer elective , isolated coronary bypass surgery randomize coronary artery bypass perform without cardiopulmonary bypass . These patient enrol March 2000 August 2001 . The primary objective study test hypothesis patency coronary artery bypass graft construct off-pump coronary artery bypass ( OPCAB ) less durable patency construct conventional CABG cardiopulmonary bypass ( CABG/CPB ) &gt; 5 year follow-up ( non-inferiority hypothesis ) . The secondary objective determine whether difference randomize group follow outcome measure &gt; 5 year : 1 . Neurocognitive Function 2 . Stroke/cerebral injury 3 . Health-related quality life 4 . Myocardial perfusion ischemia 5 . Major Adverse Cardiac Events ( MACE ) 6 . Cardiac Functional Status 7 . Incidence severity angina 8 . All cause mortality cardiovascular mortality 9 . Cost hospital re-admissions since 1 year follow-up</detailed_description>
