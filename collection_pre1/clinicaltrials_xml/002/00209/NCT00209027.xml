	<detailed_description>TITLE : Aripiprazole effect reward process deficit syndrome schizophrenia Principal Investigator : Erica Duncan , M.D . Background- This study way people schizophrenia may feel get reward . Certain part brain play part people feel happy win sort reward good thing happen . Some people schizophrenia may trouble feel pleasure part brain , frontal cortex , may work properly . We study understand frontal cortex work people without schizophrenia try win reward . We use special kind brain scan call Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) show brain work action . fMRI scan us big magnet take special picture brain . A new medicine call aripiprazole approve Food Drug Administration treat symptom schizophrenia . This medicine new mechanism action help neural function part brain involved planning goal set . We think new medication may help brain processing reward . We therefore study brain fMRI scan treatment aripiprazole . Objective- The objective study determine whether subject negative symptom schizophrenia abnormal functioning brain circuit relevant reward processing , determine whether abnormality normalize treatment aripiprazole . Research Plan-Aim 1 . Define impairment neural correlate reward process primary deficit syndrome schizophrenic compare normal control . Ten stable outpatient primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia compare ten normal control BOLD contrast fMRI experiment construct assess parametric design recruitment reward circuitry response increase monetary reward . We predict frontal cortical area important reward processing OFC ACC reduce activation schizophrenic subject . Aim 2 . Assess ability aripiprazole normalize reward circuit function deficit syndrome schizophrenia , correlate fMRI change clinical change negative symptom . The ten schizophrenic subject Aim 1 switched standard antipsychotic treatment twelve week open label aripiprazole retested fMRI monetary reward task . We predict twelve week aripiprazole treatment normalize activation OFC ACC response monetary reward stimulus . We predict degree normalization fMRI activation correlate negative symptom improvement aripiprazole . Methods- Up 25 volunteer schizophrenia 25 volunteer without psychiatric disorder participate study Atlanta VA Medical Center . Subjects first interview medical psychiatric history , current symptom . They receive fMRI scan play computer game reward correct responses money . This fMRI session allow assessment part brain function rewarding condition . The result compare subject without schizophrenia . The subject schizophrenia antipsychotic medication taper switched aripiprazole twelve week treatment phase . They see end Week 1 , Week 2 , Week 4 , Week 6 , Week 8 , Week 10 , Week 12 . At last visit fMRI scan repeat reward task . Clinical Relevance- The inability experience pleasure inability pursue goal important symptom schizophrenia . These symptom probably play huge role prevent many people schizophrenia lead full fulfilling life . A central defect reward processing pathway brain may account symptom . If aripiprazole demonstrate improve functioning brain pathway , would greatly advance understand schizophrenia could bring great function patient schizophrenia . Complete study Protocol : ARIPIPRAZOLE EFFECTS ON REWARD PROCESSING IN DEFICIT SYNDROME SCHIZOPHRENIA Principal Investigator : Erica Duncan , MD Specific Aims The chronic negative symptom schizophrenia remain poorly responsive psychopharmacologic treatment . The impaired motivation primary deficit syndrome patient prevents pursue social occupational goal prevents develop meaningful productive life . This proposal base test hypothesis schizophrenic patient endure deficit symptom suffer impairment reward process translation perceive reward salience goal-oriented behavior . Preclinical clinical research reveal functioning distribute neural network process reward stimulus . Regions prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) key frontal cortical element neural circuit mediate reward salience , reward expectation , reward approach behavior . Aripiprazole , virtue ' activity dopamine ( DA ) partial agonist , uniquely suit enhance function frontal area crucial reward processing . We hypothesize primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia associate functional deficit reward circuitry detectable fMRI scan monetary reward task . We hypothesize treatment aripiprazole normalize reward circuit function subject thus contribute improvement negative symptom . The follow specific aim test hypothesis : Aim 1 . Define impairment neural correlate reward process primary deficit syndrome schizophrenic compare normal control . Ten stable outpatient primary deficit syndrome schizophrenia compare ten normal control BOLD contrast fMRI experiment construct assess parametric design recruitment reward circuitry response increase monetary reward . We predict frontal cortical area important reward processing OFC ACC reduce activation schizophrenic subject . Aim 2 . Assess ability aripiprazole normalize reward circuit function deficit syndrome schizophrenia , correlate fMRI change clinical change negative symptom . The ten schizophrenic subject Aim 1 switched standard antipsychotic treatment twelve week open label aripiprazole retested fMRI monetary reward task . We predict twelve week aripiprazole treatment normalize activation OFC ACC response monetary reward stimulus . We predict degree normalization fMRI activation correlate negative symptom improvement aripiprazole . Background Significance Negative Symptoms Deficit Reward Processing Antipsychotic medication often able relieve positive symptom schizophrenia hallucination , delusion , disorganization . However response deficit symptom psychopharmacology remain disappointing . Many patient minimal active psychotic symptom severely impaired function endure deficit syndrome feature . A key component deficit syndrome lack motivation pursue goal educational , occupational , social , recreational domain . This proposal rest hypothesis core feature amotivational component deficit state deficiency reward processing . This deficiency turn fails provide sufficient stimulation conditioning reinforcement approach behavior serve pursuit reward . In patient impairment severe patient fail pursue primary reward food drink . But motivation pursue complex secondary reinforcer economic success , stable love relationship , avocation , intellectual fulfillment uniquely human goal strikingly lack deficit syndrome patient . Frontal Cortical Hypofunction Negative Symptoms Refinements DA hypothesis emphasize imbalance mesocortical subcortical/mesolimbic DA activity . Hyperactivity mesolimbic DA system implicate positive symptom illness ; hypofunctioning mesocortical DA pathway implicate pathophysiology negative symptom ( Weinberger 1987 ; Davis et al.1991 ) . The finding neurophysiologic hypofunction frontal cortex cognitive activation study schizophrenic subject give rise concept hypofrontality ( Weinberger et al . 1986 ; Berman et al . 1986 ; review see Weinberger et al . 1994 ) . Furthermore , frontal hypofunction link specifically negative symptom irrespective severity positive symptom unmedicated schizophrenic ( Wolkin et al . 1992 ) . Neural Circuitry Reward Processing Research neural correlate reward process indicates importance midbrain dopamine ( DA ) neuron distribute reward circuit cod reward anticipation salience , translation motivation approach behavior . Key structure implicate reward process basis animal study include DA neuron ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) substantia nigra target area nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) , amygdala , OFC ( Wise 1980 ; Wise Hoffman 1992 ; Koob 1992 ; Robbins Everitt 1996 ; see Schultz 2000 , 2001 review ) . Circuitry link area hypothesize mediate several aspect reward process detection primary secondary reward stimulus , prediction expect future reward , use information control goal-directed motivate behavior ( Schultz 2000 ) . Recently develop method use study reward pathway normal human subject substance abuse disorder fMRI environment . These study implicate mesocorticolimbic DA system functionally connect area : OFC , ACC , dorsolateral PFC , amygdala , NAcc , insula ( Grant et al . 1996 ; Childress et al . 1999 ; Maas et al . 1998 ; Garavan et al . 2000 ; Kilts et al . 2001 ; Wexler et al . 2001 ) . fMRI paradigm use money secondary reinforcer reveal activation many area : amygdala , NAcc , ventral striatum , area PFC ( Thut et al . 1997 ; Elliott et al . 2000 ; Elliott et al . 2003 ) . The fact similar area activate primary reinforcer paradigm animal study , drug cue study substance abuser , monetary reward paradigm normal control suggest study monetary reward processing valid strategy ass integrity reward circuitry experimental paradigm . Overlap Reward Circuitry Areas Implicated Negative Symptoms As indicated , dopaminergic hypofunction PFC strongly implicate pathophysiology negative symptom . The presentation reward stimuli predict reward stimulate phasic activation dopaminergic neuron midbrain ( Shultz 2000 ) innervate PFC . Hence critical overlap circuitry implicate negative symptom circuitry subserve reward processing . This overlap support use reward paradigm explore functional integrity mesocortical DA input PFC function . Aripiprazole Negative Symptoms The novel antipsychotic , aripiprazole , unique pharmacological mechanism action make potentially unique amelioration negative symptom . Aripiprazole think increase DA activity PFC virtue ' activity partial agonist post-synaptic DA2 receptor ( Burris et al . 2002 ) . We hypothesize treatment aripiprazole normalize function PFC reward circuitry increase DA function frontal cortical region ( OFC , ACC ) subserve reward processing . Potential Importance Proposal Treatment Indications Aripiprazole The severe impairment motivate behavior patient deficit syndrome schizophrenia strongly suggestive abnormality neural circuit mediate reward processing translation reward salience motivate behavior . To date publish fMRI study function reward circuit subject deficit syndrome schizophrenia . We hypothesize negative symptom schizophrenic exhibit impaired fMRI estimate activation reward circuitry compare normal control , aripiprazole treatment normalize function circuitry . The demonstration improvement negative symptom medication trial elusive . Even agent capable improve reward processing might produce detectable decrease rating scale design measure negative symptom short term . This patient chronic deficit state compromise function due cumulative effect social occupational dysfunction . In patient , normalization reward process circuit medication aripiprazole would first step . These patient likely require considerable psychosocial rehabilitation recoup occupational social functioning achieve meaningful gain negative symptom rating scale . However , normalization reward circuitry function would strongly suggest aripiprazole potential improve chronic negative symptom combine support rehabilitative program . Significant change reward circuit function would also strongly support early intervention potential aripiprazole prevent chronic deterioration function first break patient treat agent early course . Materials Methods Subjects Ten male schizophrenic subject age 18-60 recruit . Diagnosis confirm structure diagnostic interview ( SCID-I ) . Primary deficit syndrome confirm rating Schedule Deficit Syndrome ( SDS ) , scale defines schizophrenic subject accord whether chronic negative symptom even across period positive symptom remission ( Kirkpatrick et al . 1989 ) . This scale thus allow differentiation patient negative symptom consistently across clinical state whose negative symptom emerge acutely psychotic remit positive symptom remit . Additionally , subject must minimum score 30 SANS . Subjects exclude clinically significant unstable medical illness , history neurological disease include head trauma loss consciousness &gt; 5 minute , active substance abuse dependence within prior three month , contraindication fMRI , leave handedness , mental retardation , color blindness , antipsychotic treatment resistance , know allergy nonresponse aripiprazole . Subjects schizophrenia exclude work telephone . Ten male normal comparison subject recruit , match mean age ethnicity schizophrenic group . Absence psychopathology confirm SCID-I , NP version . Subjects exclude clinically significant unstable medical illness , history neurological disease include head trauma loss consciousness &gt; 5 minute , active substance abuse dependence within prior three month , contraindication fMRI , leave handedness , color blindness , mental retardation . Normal control match schizophrenic subject regard monthly income monetary reward task comparable reinforcement value . Baseline Assessment Prior fMRI scan subject assess smoke status mean Fagerstrom Smoking Tolerance Questionnaire ( Fagerstrom 1978 ) nicotine dependent subject instruct smoke usual amount prior report scan . Screening intact vision ( ≥ 20/25 uncorrected correct eyeglass contact lens ) mean eye chart conduct . Cognitive status assess follow domain : attention ( Continuous Performance Test ) , psychomotor reaction time ( finger tap test ) , memory ( California Verbal Learning Test ) , IQ ( Weschler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence , vocabulary matrix subtests ) , executive function ( Stroop Task ) . The schizophrenic subject rat severity psychopathology mean PANSS , Abrams Taylor Rating Scale Emotional Blunting ( A &amp; T ) , SANS , Clinical Global Impression Scale ( CGI ) , Quality Life Scale . Current side effect antipsychotic assess mean Barnes Akathisia Scale Simpson Angus Scale . Schizophrenic subject 30cc blood drawn CBC SMA-12 ensure stable baseline medical status prior switch aripiprazole . Cognitive Task Meaningful comparison schizophrenic non-schizophrenic subject cognitive task necessitates use simple task minimize confounds related group difference cognitive ability . A parametric manipulation reward contingency control group difference task performance . The proposed monetary incentive task , adapt Elliott et al . ( 2003 ) , choose simplicity parametric design . The subject give simple target detection task instruct squeeze response bulb see red blue square . Different color square present screen 1.3 sec . When correctly signal target stimulus see reward stimulus inform much money trial . For trial non-targets ( pay reward subject squeeze bulb ) subject see neutral text tell wait . The reward amount vary 5¢ $ 1 per trial ( 5¢ , 25¢ , 50¢ , 75¢ , $ 1 ) . The task divide five block separate 30 sec rest period . Each block contain 40 trial . Trial type present randomized order within block : 30 % trial contain one two target stimulus . Each block pay correct responses one five monetary reward level . The task design specifically allow `` on-off '' assessment activation presence absence reward , also parametric analysis brain area increase activation increase reward level . The subject tell payment participation fMRI scan total money accumulate correct response task . This latter point important money task performance real world salience likely enhance reward-related activation subject automatically pay amount regardless accuracy . Thus subject receive actual rather simulated reward . fMRI Scanning Blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD ) fMRI scan perform research dedicate Siemens 3T whole body MRI scanner locate Emory Hospital MRI Center . Foam pad use restrict subject ' head motion within magnet . 30 axial slice 3 mm thickness acquire parallel AC-PC line matrix size 64 x 64 field view 22 x 22 cm , use TE 30 msec . With protocol successfully image orbitofrontal cortex minimal magnetic susceptibility artifact . The functional image obtain use T2* weight spiral-scan pulse sequence ( TR 3000 msec , TE 25 msec , flip angle 60 deg ) . High resolution anatomical T1-weighted MR image acquire localization task-related neural activation ( TR =10 msec , TE = 4.5 msec , TI=900 msec , FOV=24 cm , 256 x 256 matrix , contiguous 3 mm slice cover whole brain ) . Aripiprazole Treatment After receive first scan , schizophrenic subject start open label aripiprazole 15 mg po qd . Over subsequent six week titrate target dose 30 mg po qd maintain dose next six week . The aripiprazole titration schedule follow : 15 mg Weeks 1-2 , 20 mg Weeks 3-6 , 30 mg. During first six week treatment phase prior antipsychotic gradually taper ( 75 % total daily dose Week 1 2 , 50 % total daily dose Weeks 3 4 , 25 % total daily dose Week 5 6 ) discontinue . The subject bring study visit end Week 1 , Week 2 , Week 4 , Week 6 , Week 8 , Week 10 , Week 12 . At study visit rat PANSS , SANS , CGI , A &amp; T . Extrapyramidal side effect akathisia rat Simpson Angus Scale Barnes Akathisia Scale respectively . The Quality Life Scale , CVLT , CPT , Stroop Test repeat end Week 12 . Stopping Rules Subjects Schizophrenia There risk symptom exacerbation antipsychotic medication switch . For reason , several safeguard put place . 1 . Subjects exclude history suicidal , assaultive behavior psychotic decompensations . 2 . The subject give cross-titration whereby prior antipsychotic medication gradually taper six week aripiprazole titrate maximum dose . 3 . Subjects schizophrenia group closely monitor treatment phase . They give reminder call day study visit . If come schedule visit , study staff call reschedule soonest day come . Subjects without work telephone exclude . 4 . At visit subject rat CGI . If CGI Global Improvement Scale rat 6 ( Much Worse ) 7 ( Very Much Worse ) visit , drop study previous antipsychotic resume dose prior enrollment . fMRI Image Analysis Imaging data analyze mean MATLAB statistical parametric mapping software ( SPM99 ) . The image resliced correct motion registration first functional image acquire subject use 6 parameter transformation ( Friston et al 1995 ) . Images spatially normalize Montreal Neurological Institute template . A high-pass filter use remove low frequency noise . Image smooth use 6 mm Gaussian kernel use enhance signal-to-noise ratio accommodate difference neuroanatomy facilitate group comparison . The delayed cerebral blood flow response activation condition model use standard hemodynamic response function . Statistical analysis proceed use random effect model examine outcome parametric design experiment ( Buchel et al . 1998 ) . We model linear nonlinear hemodynamic response region interest : Nacc , amygdala , striatum , thalamus , OFC , ACC , hippocampus . Analysis Behavioral Data For Aim 1 , cognitive data analyze subject MANOVA compare neurocognitive result schizophrenic normal control . For Aim 2 , behavioral rating scale data repeat cognitive test score ( CVLT , Stroop Test , CPT ) analyze repeated measure MANOVA model use timepoint within subject factor .
