In process , depression may contribute genesis type 2 diabetes ( impact neurohormonal activation , inflammatory mediator , insulin resistance ) , difficulty management ( decrease adherence diet plan , medication , schedule appointment ) . The preliminary data Grady Diabetes Clinic indicate depression may common African-Americans diabetes , depression factor non-adherence , non-adherence lead poor glycemic control - direct cause diabetes complication . What known : treatment depression could lead neurohormonal psychobiological improvement , improve patient adherence glycemic control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To determine psychobehavioral neurohormonal mechanism effective treatment , investigator conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial patient major depression , receive either : ( ) computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) program entitle `` Beating Blues '' + placebo , ( ii ) computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) program entitle `` Beating Blues '' + SSRI antidepressant escitalopram . The investigator ass ( ) glycemic control ( level glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) ) , relation ( b ) adherence ( keep schedule return appointment , diet , exercise , glucose monitoring ) , ( c ) depressive symptom ( neurocognitive neurobehavioral symptom determine self- observer-rated scale ) , ( ) four pathway neurometabolic function . Study visit occur month 6 month . Should patient report severe environmental stressor ( marital conflict , loss family member job , expose trauma ) , patient offer intensification contact study personnel , e.g . weekly contact phone `` in-person '' visit see study personnel Grady Diabetes Clinic .</detailed_description>
