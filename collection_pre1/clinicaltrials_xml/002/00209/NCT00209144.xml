	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study Potential Anti-Inflammatory Effects Glucose Control During Acute Myocardial Infarction .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two three heart attack patient high blood sugar . Half patient diabetes half call pre-diabetes , mean high blood sugar normal high enough diabetes . Over 40 million Americans pre-diabetes . For 70 year , doctor know patient high blood sugar survive recover heart attack well patient normal blood sugar . Doctors figure reason difference . The best treatment available heart attack call angioplasty . Angioplasty mean doctor put small balloon block blood vessel , blow balloon open blockage , insert small wire tube call stent hold blockage open . Blood thinner heart medicine also give patient help blood get block blood vessel . Angioplasty medicine help many people survive recover heart attack . But even doctor use drug , balloon stent , patient high blood sugar still bad patient normal blood sugar . We want figure high blood sugar bad patient heart attack . Past research tell u might two reason . The first high blood sugar increase inflammation part body 's natural response heart attack . Inflammation cause person 's skin turn hot red injure . Although inflammation part body 's natural healing process , much inflammation harmful . We think patient high blood sugar heart attack much inflammation . The second reason high blood sugar might bad heart attack patient high blood sugar make blood thicker . When blood vessel block , thick blood make hard heart get blood flow need . This doctor use aspirin blood thinner treat patient heart attack . The amount inflammation thickness person 's blood measure laboratory . In study , want measure amount inflammation thickness patient ' blood see difference patient normal blood sugar , patient pre-diabetes , patient diabetes . If show difference , help u understand high blood sugar bad patient heart attack . We also want see lower patient 's high blood sugar helpful heart attack . The standard therapy lower blood sugar diabetic patient heart attack check blood sugar four time day hospital , give shot medicine call insulin help bring blood sugar level high . However , research tell u way treat diabetic patient n't get blood sugar low enough . Also , patient pre-diabetes patient diabetes n't know usually n't get insulin , sugar level usually allow run high hospital . In study , treat half diabetic pre-diabetic patient usual way give half insulin IV first 24 hour hospital . If compare inflammation blood thickness patient treat usual way patient treated insulin , figure lower blood sugar usual helpful patient heart attack . If find high blood sugar harmful patient heart attack , show treat patient insulin usual lessens harmful effect , able improve way patient treat . This could result good survival recovery many heart attack patient . All patient volunteer study get best treatment available heart attack- angioplasty , blood thinner , heart medication usually give patient . Patients high blood sugar divide two group . One group blood sugar measure treated usual way . The group treat insulin run IV 24 hour . After 24 hour , patient treat usual way . About one tablespoon blood drawn patient time sign study 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 hour later . This blood use test inflammation blood thickness . The way patient volunteer study treat differently standard care might receive insulin usual blood drawn usual . Giving extra insulin patient cause harm , may even help . Since 5 tablespoon extra blood drawn patient , cause patient harm . Goals study 1 . To see happens blood inflammation thickness heart attack patient normal blood sugar compare patient high blood sugar . 2 . To find lowering patient ' blood sugar level currently result less blood inflammation thickness .</detailed_description>
