	<detailed_description>America face epidemic obesity among youth . In last seven year , 50 % increase prevalence obesity define Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; 30 kg/m² . For morbidly obese adult , define BMI &gt; 35 kg/m² , mortality increase 152 279 % . In Veterans Administration study obese 25-34 year old male , 13-fold excess mortality rate 7½ year . As adult , risk associate childhood adolescent obesity include elevate blood pressure cholesterol level , predispose individual cardiovascular disease . In addition , significant number obese youth abnormally high concentration insulin , attendant increase risk develop type 2 diabetes mellitus . Currently , limit option available help individual . While attempts lifestyle change ( e.g. , alter diet activity level ) may success short term , attempt maintain weight loss long term often fail . Furthermore , current medication safely induce significant weight loss time . Metformin oral antihyperglycemic , insulin-sensitizing agent use many country treatment type 2 diabetes 40 year . In March 1995 , approve Food Drug Administration treatment adult type 2 diabetes . Metformin improve insulin sensitivity reduces insulin resistance hepatic peripheral action . It increase insulin secretion . Further , metformin decrease hepatic glucose production result weight loss . Compared available drug act similarly , metformin weight-lowering activity , perhaps increase nitric oxide production improve insulin sensitivity . It also possible mild gastrointestinal side effect metformin induce weight loss . Metformin therefore often agent choice obese , type 2 diabetic . In study non-diabetic obese adult , treatment metformin result decrease food intake , decrease body weight fat . This randomized , double blind , placebo control , multi-center clinical trial . The primary outcome measure use test study hypothesis change BMI week 0 week 52 , well change BMI week 0 week 100 . Approximately 135 potential subject screen participate institution , expect 76 subject randomize study .</detailed_description>
