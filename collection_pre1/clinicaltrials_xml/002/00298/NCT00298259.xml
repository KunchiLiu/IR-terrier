	<brief_summary>Background : Fracture several rib one place result trauma , lead paradoxical movement chest wall ventilatory failure . The mainstay management patient traditionally analgesia positive pressure ventilation splint chest wall allow heal ribs begin . However , management option lead prolonged intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay increase complication rate patient remain ventilator prolonged period . Patients often remain ventilator two three week wait enough rib heal provide sufficient chest wall stability allow patient take breathing . Until time , patient risk pneumonia sepsis complication . Long term disability report patient include ongoing pain syndrome , inability return work , particularly manual type labour cosmetic chest wall deformity . An alternative treatment strategy operatively fix rib . By fix rib operatively , patient long require internal pneumatic stabilization ( provided mechanical ventilation ) wean ventilator within day rather week . This potentially lead earlier discharge intensive care unit , avoidance multiple complication arise ventilate patient . Rib fixation may also lead less pain deformity , improve mobility post injury phase earlier return work . Hypothesis : early operative fixation rib patient present flail chest secondary trauma result le mechanical ventilatory requirement , early discharge intensive care unit lower rate complication associate prolonged mechanical ventilation . This lead cost saving treatment patient .</brief_summary>
