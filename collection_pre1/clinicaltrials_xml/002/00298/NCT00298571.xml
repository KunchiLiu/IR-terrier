	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PROTOCOL Title : Cesarean Delivery Postoperative Pain Management Local Anesthesia Investigators : Aaron Deutsch , MD , Principal Investigator Shelly Holmstrom , MD Abstract : Pain control become prominent clinical issue . Typically , patient undergo Cesarean delivery administer spinal anesthesia prior surgery . Postoperative pain manage intravenous ( IV ) narcotic use patient control anesthesia ( PCA ) pump device . Once patient tolerate oral medication , PCA pump discontinue patient us oral narcotic medication pain control . Research show inject local anesthetic subcutaneous tissue along incision reduce postoperative pain . The objective study randomly assign patient receive local anesthetic normal saline tissue surround incision study amount pain experience postoperatively group patient . Our hypothesis patient receive local anesthesia along incision significantly less pain postoperatively use less narcotic medication . Objectives : Primary : To decrease postoperative pain woman undergo Cesarean delivery Secondary : To decrease narcotic use , potentially decrease hospital length stay , increase patient satisfaction Background , Study Rationale Significance : Local anesthesia inject incision site fro reduce postoperative pain study abdominal surgery . The research demonstrate effectiveness technique reduce postoperative pain . One journal article describe technique similar propose research project1 . However , article show significant difference postoperative pain follow bupivacaine normal saline injection skin . The author ' conclusion lack significance due facility 's high quality analgesia via supplemental subarachnoid morphine . Numerous author demonstrate effectiveness use local anesthesia incision sit reduce pain postoperatively2-4 . The propose research project potential decrease pain postoperatively , decrease hospital length stay increase patient satisfaction one common surgery United States America . 1 .

Study Population : Patients currently undergo repeat Cesarean delivery history previous Cesarean delivery Pfannenstiel skin incision eligible enroll study . All age race eligible . Exclusion criterion include patient primary Cesarean delivery , prior vertical skin incision allergy bupivacaine . The projected sample size require study 100 ( 50 patient arm ) . Study Procedures Research Plan : This study randomize double blind placebo control trial . Patients randomize either bupivacaine placebo ( normal saline ) group . An opaque envelope contain slip paper indicate fluid inject . The anesthesiologist open envelope surgery prepare 30 ml study drug . The patient incision site inject either bupivacaine normal saline completion surgery . The patient ask assess level pain follow surgery postoperative day 0 , 1 , 2 3 use visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Expected result : The hypothesis patient receive bupivacaine injection experience significantly less postoperative pain use significantly less IV oral narcotic medication . Human Subject Issues - minimal additional risk patient study . Bupivacaine time proven safe drug ( bar patient allergic ) dose far toxicity level . There social risk risk confidentiality patient personally identify study . - benefit : benefit patient would higher satisfaction due well pain control . Additionally , patient may require less narcotic post-operatively potentially short hospital stay . - patient information keep track via name med rec number chart review study completion ass data . This info limit primary investigator . - note fetus deliver prior time anesthetic administration , expose . Informed Consent Informed consent obtain time consent cesarian delivery . The resident obtain consent also obtain research consent . This consist explain patient may receive either local anesthetic placebo help assess good post-op pain control . Possible benefit explain along minimal risks- normal cesarian delivery . The consent process available Spanish English applicable . Statistical Plan - sample size/power analysis : statistical power study show statistical difference calculate approx 33 patient arm- extend 50 . - statistical analysis : Data Forms Questionaire ( see attach )</detailed_description>
