	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate efficacy oral methotrexate treatment active axial spondyloarthritis ( early ankylosing spondylitis spondyloarthritis sacroiliitis ) . Efficacy measure reduction sign symptom active spondyloarthritis include effect back pain stiffness , range motion spine , physical function , quality life incidence arthritis , enthesitis anterior uveitis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The establish classification criterion ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) rely combination clinical symptom plus radiographic sacroiliitis least grade 2 bilaterally grade 3 unilaterally . It usually take several year definite radiographic sacroiliitis evolve . Diagnosis AS may delay 10 year onset symptom , diagnosis base radiographic finding . A group lead expert field spondyloarthropathies propose 2004 term `` axial spondyloarthritis '' attempt narrow gap 5-10 year first symptoms diagnosis AS ( Rudwaleit et al . Ann Rheum Dis 2004 ; 63:535-43 ) . Using proposed approach , early diagnosis AS ( axial spondyloarthritis ) make high degree confidence , least two three spondyloarthritis feature ( clinical finding , laboratory test skeletal image ) present . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) sacroiliac joint appear especially useful tool diagnosis early AS . Early diagnosis treatment could probably prevent structural damage lead well functional outcome . Treatment AS largely consist non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . Most disease modify antirheumatic drug effective axial manifestation . Sulfasalazine efficacy peripheral symptom . Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha block drug infliximab etanercept effective axial peripheral manifestation disease . According consensus statement , initiation anti-TNF alpha therapy require definitive diagnosis AS , base radiographic evidence sacroiliitis . It well document , oral methotrexate effective safe treatment rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis . Still , study prove usefulness treatment AS lacking . To date , three small randomise controlled trial clarify issue conduct . The dose methotrexate use study low , 7,5 - 10 mg per week . One study show benefit active treatment group . There statistically significant benefit methotrexate two study . The purpose study assess efficacy oral methotrexate adult subject active axial spondyloarthritis . Subjects randomly assign placebo methotrexate treatment group . All subject active treatment group receive least dose 15 mg per week oral methotrexate . To reduce mucosal , gastrointestinal haematologic side effect low-dose methotrexate study subject receive also dose 5 mg per week folic acid . A stable dose NSAID study permit . The duration double-blinded treatment period 24 week . Efficacy treatment measure reduction sign symptoms axial spondyloarthritis week 12 24 . If primary outcome ASAS20 ( ASsessment Ankylosing Spondylitis response criterion , improvement least 20 % patient report symptom ) meet week 12 , dose methotrexate correspond placebo increase 20 mg per week week 12 24 . Clinical history anterior uveitis incidence study also record . An ophthalmologic examination perform baseline week 24 . To subset patient MRI scan sacroiliac joint do also week 24 , ass change active inflammatory lesion detect MRI . An extension study radiological progression also plan . X-ray change sacroiliac joint lumbosacral spine assess baseline 3 5 year .</detailed_description>
