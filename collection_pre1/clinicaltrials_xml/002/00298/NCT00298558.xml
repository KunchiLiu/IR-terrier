	<brief_title>ACTIVE : Advanced Cognitive Training Independent Vital Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ACTIVE 4-arm , single-blind , randomize control trial . The primary objective ACTIVE test effectiveness durability three distinct cognitive intervention improve elder ' performance basic measure cognition measure cognitively demand daily activity ( e.g. , food preparation , drive , medication use , financial management ) . These intervention previously find successful improve cognitive ability laboratory small-scale field condition . The three intervention share common design feature : 1 ) equivalent intensity duration ; 2 ) small group setting ten 60-75 minute session ; 3 ) focus strategy solve problem , remember , respond quickly information ; 4 ) model demonstration strategy usage ; 5 ) practice exemplar problem ; 6 ) individual group exercise ; 7 ) feedback performance ; 8 ) foster self-efficacy regard performance ; 9 ) apply strategy real-world task ; 10 ) individualize training experience , 11 ) social interaction activity . In three intervention , Sessions 1-5 focus strategy instruction exercise practice strategy . Sessions 6-10 provide additional practice exercise , new strategy introduce . Content 10 session script trainer 's manual . Interventions : 1 . Reasoning training focus inductive reasoning , ability solve problem follow serial pattern manifest executive functioning . Participants taught strategy identify pattern sequence require solve problem . Training exercise involve identify pattern laboratory-type reason task everyday activity , e.g. , understand pattern bus schedule . 2 . Memory training focus verbal episodic memory , deal acquisition retrieval information acquire particular place particular time . Participants teach mnemonic strategy remember list sequence item , text material , main idea detail story text-based information . Training exercise involve recall laboratory-like episodic memory task well task relate everyday activity recall shopping list . 3 . Speed training focus visual search ability identify locate visual information quickly divide attention format , without distractors . Participants practice speeded task computer , allow proceed complex task , faster fast presentation speed pace . 4 . A control group receive training . In addition , booster training provide help participant maintain gain make initial training improve cognitive skill . Booster training provide random sample approximately 50 % training participant 11 35-36 month primary training . Participant involvement include assessment conduct baseline , immediately post-intervention , 12 , 24 , 36 60 month . Assessments conduct individual group session . For participant randomize intervention group , intervention conduct small group setting ten 60-75 minute session 5-6 week period . These behavioral intervention pharmacologic component . Eleven month initial training provide , booster training offer , three intervention arm , randomly select 60 % initially trained subject . Booster train deliver four 75-minute session 2-3 week period . The primary study hypothesis : - Each training group perform good train control group respective primary proximal outcome - Those group receive booster training perform well receive booster training respective primary proximal outcome .</detailed_description>
