	<brief_summary>Transvaginal ultrasound cervix become common tool evaluate patient risk preterm delivery . A shortened cervical length associate increase risk preterm delivery . Dynamic cervical change visible shortening ( &gt; 6mm ) cervix see ultrasound examination . Prior study show presence dynamic change patient shorten cervical length ( &lt; 3cm ) independently predictive preterm delivery . However , subset patient normal initial cervical length ( &gt; 3cm ) dynamic change demonstrate increase rate preterm delivery . Because small sub-group , present study design obtain large sample size evaluation . The second focus study involve patient dilate cervix whether cervical length add predictive value gestational age delivery . Patients present symptomatic preterm labor ( vaginal pressure uterine contraction ) , consent study , undergo standard evaluation preterm labor ( described detail . ) The additional evaluation prolong transvaginal ultrasound approximately 10 minute evaluate presence dynamic change contraction . Null hypothesis : Symptomatic preterm labor patient , normal initial cervical length ( &gt; 3cm ) , exhibit dynamic cervical change deliver gestational age equal without dynamic change . Alternative hypothesis : Symptomatic preterm labor patient , normal initial cervical length ( &gt; 3cm ) , exhibit dynamic cervical change deliver earlier gestational age without dynamic change .</brief_summary>
