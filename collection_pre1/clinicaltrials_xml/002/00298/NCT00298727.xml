	<brief_title>The Effect Mediators Two Knowledge Translation Strategies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventions : Two different KT intervention curriculum evaluate : 1 . Stakeholder-Hosted Interactive Problem-Based Seminar ( SHIPS ) , 2 . Online Problem-Based course ( ePBL ) . SHIPs consist face-to-face PBL ( Problem-based Learning ) ( 2Â½ day ) outcome measure developer facilitator , use 6 problem generate consultation participant . The ePBL consist 6-week web-based course 6 generic problem develop content expert . Outcome Measures : Baseline predictor include demographic , knowledge , attitudes/barriers regard outcome measure Readiness Change assess self-report . Immediately post-intervention 6 month later re-administered . Primary qualitative quantitative evaluation conduct 6-months post-intervention ass relative effectiveness KT intervention identify element contribute change clinical behavior . Chart audit determine utilization outcome measure ( count ) . Incorporation outcome measure clinical reasoning assess use innovative technique : chart-stimulated recall . The Study Sample : Physical Occupational Therapists ( n=144 ; 80 % power detect effect size 0.5 ; alpha=0.05 ) recruit partnership national professional association . Methods : SHIPS conduct three urban center Canada . Participants block allocate minimization procedure either two intervention minimize prognostic difference . Trained evaluator site conduct chart audit chart-stimulated recall . Trained interviewer conduct semi-structured interview focus identify critical element KT implement practice change . Interviews transcribe verbatim . Analyses : Analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , baseline score covariate , use compare chart-stimulated recall score 6-months post-intervention . Secondary analysis also use ANCOVA remain potential predictor . Qualitative content analysis conduct iteratively saturation achieve . Knowledge Impact Transfer : A strategy optimal transfer health outcome measure practice develop share multiple discipline involve primary specialty management musculoskeletal childhood disability . In addition , work national professional organization Ministries Health use knowledge study support national initiative implementation assist best KT practice health service education .</detailed_description>
