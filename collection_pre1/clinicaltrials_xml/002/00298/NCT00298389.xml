	<brief_summary>Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) frequent chest infection patient likely become bad time . Why people susceptible chest infection know . One reason might white cell lung call macrophage work properly . Normally , cell remove debris inhale lung . This also include bacteria . In patient COPD , macrophages able remove particle . The research question address happens</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) comprise chronic bronchitis , small airway disease emphysema . The major risk factor development COPD cigarette smoking therefore , prevalence disease increase . COPD account increase number hospital admission due increase number chest infection exacerbation . This may relate reduced capacity macrophage COPD patient phagocytose bacteria apoptotic cell . The reason defect innate immune response subject unclear suggestion scavenger receptor may alter oxidative stress reduce phagocytotic pathway . This would relevant COPD , increase oxidative stress associate cigarette smoking . We preliminary data show similar reduce phagocytotic response monocyte-derived macrophage ( MDM ) COPD patient compare smoker non-smokers . As cell expose oxidative stress mechanism may play role reduce phagocytosis . Using MDM model , take blood patient COPD , aim investigate mechanism defective phagocytosis COPD . We measure expression regulation cell surface scavenger receptor cell disease patient control subject examine signal pathway lead actin polymerization phagosome formation . Finally , aim identify novel therapeutic strategy reverse effect augment phagocytosis macrophage patient COPD . Such strategy would reduce chest infection exacerbation hence improve quality life .</detailed_description>
