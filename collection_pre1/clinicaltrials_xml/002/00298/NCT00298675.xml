	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety , establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) generate pharmacokinetic profile BSI-201 IV administration adult subject histologically document advanced solid tumor refractory standard therapy standard therapy available . Additionally , safety tolerability clinical response BSI-201 + irinotecan investigate patient metastatic breast cancer phase 1b portion study . Based data generate BiPar/Sanofi , conclude iniparib posse characteristic typical PARP inhibitor class . The exact mechanism yet fully elucidate , however base experiment tumor cell perform laboratory , iniparib novel investigational anti-cancer agent induces gamma-H2AX ( marker DNA damage ) tumor cell line , induces cell cycle arrest G2/M phase tumor cell line , potentiates cell cycle effect DNA damage modality tumor cell line . Investigations potential target iniparib metabolite ongoing .</brief_summary>
