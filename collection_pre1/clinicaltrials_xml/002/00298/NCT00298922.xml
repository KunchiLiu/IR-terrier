	<brief_summary>Pulmonary infection Burkholderia cepacia complex ( BCC ) patient CF often associate rapid decline lung function . Because resistance BCC many antibiotic , treatment option often limit . New therapy improve outcome patient infect BCC need . However , unpredictable nature pulmonary infection CF , patient BCC infection exclude many CF therapeutic trial . Recent publish trial United States , Australia , United Kingdom demonstrate clinical benefit prolong administration azithromycin CF . In trial , vast majority patient chronically infect Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Patients BCC exclude US UK trial , four patient BCC infection enrol Australian trial . Thus , effectiveness azithromycin CF patient infect BCC largely unknown deserves study . The two main way azithromycin think help chronic lung infection see CF [ ] reduce inflammation [ b ] direct effect bacteria , particular P. aeruginosa . BCC pulmonary infection CF often associate large inflammatory response similar severe P. aeruginosa infection . If azithromycin work mainly anti-inflammatory mechanism , also helpful CF patient infect BCC . Alternatively , azithromycin could direct effect BCC see P. aeruginosa two bacteria many similarity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN - Overview - This single center , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled 24 week trial azithromycin adult CF chronically infect BCC . The investigational therapy add usual therapy patient clinically stable time enrollment . After 168 day , study drug discontinue participant evaluate 196 day study drug 28 day . At visit , participant invite continue open label observational study azithromycin 168 additional day . Thus , duration study 52 week ( 364 day ) . - Day 0- Day 168 Study Drug ( 24 week ) - Day 169- Day 196 Study Drug ( 4 week ) - Day 197 - Day 364 OPEN label Azithromycin ( 24 week ) - Measuring primary secondary endpoint - Primary efficacy endpoint - Primary efficacy endpoint quantitative change lung function measure FEV1 % predict baseline completion 24 week treatment period . ( refer Appendix C ATS guideline ) . - Primary safety endpoint - Primary safety endpoint collect 24 week treatment period : - Adverse event gastrointestinal complaint , ototoxicity , tinnitus , hepatitis leukopenia determine : ( ) open end question study subject study visit ( ii ) laboratory test elevate liver function test hematologic abnormality , - Changes lung microbiology determine : [ 86 ] ( ) Emergent B. cenocepacia ( genomovar III ) ( ii ) Emergent non-B . cenocepacia genomovars ( iii ) Emergent NTM [ 87 ] ( iv ) Emergent azithromycin resistant NTM ( v ) Emergent Aspergillus specie ( vi ) Emergent MDRO - ( S. maltophilia , A. xylosoxidans , methicillin-resistant S. aureus ) ( vii ) Emergent P. aeruginosa ( viii ) Emergent azithromycin resistant S. aureus - Secondary efficacy endpoint - Secondary efficacy endpoint : - Quantitative change lung function measure change relative percent change FEV1 FVC baseline completion 24 week treatment period . - Quantitative change FEV1 FVC liter CF study subject treat azithromycin compare CF study subject treat placebo . FEV1 FVC liter measure accord ATS criterion - The number day first administration intravenous antibiotic and/or use oral tetracycline derivative minocycline / doxycycline seven day 24 week period . - The number pulmonary exacerbation define need treatment intravenous oral tetracycline derivative antibiotic increase pulmonary symptom 24 week period . - The proportion patient require intravenous antibiotic 24 week period . - The number day treatment intravenous antibiotic give 24 week period . - The proportion patient hospitalize . - The number hospital day calculate calendar day 24 week period . - The proportion patient require oral antibiotic 24 week period . - The number day treatment oral non-tetracycline derivative antibiotic give 24 week period . - Changes body weight baseline completion 24 week treatment period . - Change level inflammation measure change serum CRP ESR baseline end 24 week treatment period .</detailed_description>
