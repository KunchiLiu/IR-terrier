	<detailed_description>The overall hypothesis test : woman molecular phenotype highly skew X chromosome inactivation increase risk spontaneous abortion . We investigate hypothesis two complimentary aim . In Background Significance section , first present data 53-member pedigree segregate X-linked recessive lethal defect result skew X inactivation carrier female via secondary selection cell defective X chromosome active . We characterize deletion 500 kb ( approximate ) deletion distal Xq28 . Moreover , carrier female show statistically significant increase frequency spontaneous abortion compare non-deletion carry relative . Secondly , Preliminary Studies section , present data population base case-control study wherein highly skewed X chromosome inactivation significantly correlate idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortion . This protocol attempt elucidate mechanism underlie association . The first specific aim determine woman highly skew X chromosome inactivation risk pregnancy loss . This accomplished prospective protocol , analyze X chromosome inactivation pattern pregnant woman investigate possible association X chromosome inactivation pregnancy outcome . The second aim study nature pregnancy loss woman skew X chromosome inactivation . This aim correlate maternal X inactivation pattern abortus karyotype .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients prospectively ascertain woman either new pregnancy ( specific aim 1 ) , spontaneous abortion ( specific aim 2 ) . Given enrollment strategy , anticipate enrol woman age 18 45 . The study limit female . Children eligible participate study . Because patient population study ( aim 1 ) woman primary infertility undergoing fertility treatment ( aim 2 ) woman recently spontaneous abortion , research topic irrelevant child .</criteria>
