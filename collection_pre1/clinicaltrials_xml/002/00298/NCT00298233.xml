This trend may pose threat future pandemic -- worldwide outbreak disease -- avian influenza virus easily spread person person . Oseltamivir antiviral medication use treat people uncomplicated human influenza , may effective treat people either severe human influenza avian influenza .

	<brief_title>High-Dose Versus Standard-Dose Oseltamivir Treat Severe Influenza Avian Influenza</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two main type influenza virus -- Types A B -- responsible seasonal flu epidemic occur year . The influenza A viruses break subtypes base two protein surface virus : hemagglutinin ( H ) neuraminidase ( N ) . The A subtypes usually find human H1N1 , H1N2 , H3N2 . Other A subtypes find primarily animal . For example , `` avian influenza virus '' refers influenza A virus find chiefly bird . Although avian influenza usually affect human , increase number case human infection avian influenza virus H5N1 report last several year . Because influenza virus ability modify , concern trend increase case may pose threat future pandemic new H5N1 virus could spread easily person person . The H5N1 virus cause human infection Asia resistant amantadine rimantadine , two antiviral medication commonly use treat people influenza . Another antiviral medication , oseltamivir , currently use treat people uncomplicated human influenza . The purpose study compare standard-dose oseltamivir high-does oseltamivir treat people hospitalize severe human influenza avian influenza . The study also attempt identify severe human influenza avian influenza differ follow factor : clinical manifestation , relationship antiviral plasma concentration viral dynamic , pathogenesis . Upon meet certain screening criterion , participant randomly assign receive oseltamivir either standard-dose level ( 75 mg twice daily orally equivalent dose adjust age , weight , kidney function ) high-dose level ( 150 mg twice daily orally equivalent dose adjust age , weight , kidney function ) . Treatment continue 5 day , participant meet clinical failure criterion continue assign treatment additional 5 day . It anticipate participant remain hospitalized course treatment . On Day 0 , mark first day hospitalization , participant undergo medical review , physical examination , blood sampling , nasal swab , throat swab , anal swab , chest x-ray . An endotracheal aspirate procedure urine sampling may also perform . During hospital stay , procedure repeat regularly , additional sample lung fluid , cerebral spinal fluid , pleural fluid may obtain . On Day 5 possibly Day 10 , participant undergo follow-up x-ray . If applicable , participant attend outpatient study visit Days 10 , 14 , 28 evaluation ; participant avian influenza also attend visit Days 56 180 .</detailed_description>
