	<detailed_description>Despite popularity Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment ( CBT ) substance use disorder , recent finding indicate CBT may effective , less theoretically drive , treatment , CBT treatment often fail result cop skill acquisition . In order explore possibility current manual-driven mode CBT delivery may adequate successfully teach cop skill , propose pilot project development individualized assessment cognitive-behavioral treatment program ( IATP ) alcohol-dependent person , experience sampling conduct via random call cell-phones use provide data create individualize treatment plan . Data collect experience sample include momentary assessment patient ' cognition , affect , cop behavior respect drink . Participants 112 men woman meet criterion alcohol dependence , randomly assign either standard package manual-driven cognitive-behavioral treatment program ( PCBT ) like use Project MATCH , IATP . Patients treatment ask engage experience sample two week prior treatment , another two week treatment end , order compare in-vivo measure cop skill utilization , pre- posttreatment , two group . Therapy conduct 12 session treatment . In IATP , information gather experience sample form basis functional analysis patient ' drink drinking urge monitor period . Cognitive appraisal , mood cop response evaluate antecedent consequence drink behavior . Therapists use information address specific cognition , affect , behavior adaptive maladaptive , work patient substitute adaptive cop tactic instead . In PCBT experience sample data specifically use therapy , still provide in-vivo measure drink cop skill . It hypothesize IATP yield significantly well cop skill acquisition PCBT , change cop skill predict well posttreatment outcome IATP . These result would implications delivery treatment , validity cop skill train alcohol addiction .</detailed_description>
