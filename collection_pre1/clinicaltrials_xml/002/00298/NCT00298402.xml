	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking cause increase inflammation lung . In 20 % smoker inflammation lead damage lung include make hole lung tissue . This damage repair people find difficult breathe . One problem disease call chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , COPD short , time patient visit doctor symptom , damage already do . At moment , way predict smoker go develop COPD . The aim research look smokers breathe normally use image technique call CT scan , look lung detail . Some people spot scan may cause inflammation . We want look cell spot see make protein enzyme cause lung damage compare people spot . We would able predict smoker likely develop COPD treat early damage lung .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , COPD short , 3rd big killer world 2020 . The major cause disease cigarette smoking , 15-20 % smoker develop COPD . In disease , lung becomes damage patient breathe properly . This damage repair therefore moment good treatements COPD . By time patient visit doctor symptoms damage already do . Therefore study want look lung smoker feel well breathe normally . We believe much damage lung COPD cause inflammation . In particular , inflammatory cell call macrophage lung patient . These macrophage normally protect lung inhale particle like dust also inportant fight infection . In COPD , macrophage control produce huge amount enzymes break lung tissue protein cause inflammation . We want see find macrophages lung smoker get COPD . Recently , 5 half year study show smoker breathe normally increased inflammation lung . This see use scan call CT scan . On CT scan , area look like spot . When smoker another scan 5 half year later , case spot become hole lung . This call emphysema one characteristic COPD . We want know whether macrophage smoker cause damage . If case , two separate finding study . Firstly , could look macrophage predict smoker develop COPD secondly , try develop new treatment stop macrophage produce protein cause inflammation .</detailed_description>
