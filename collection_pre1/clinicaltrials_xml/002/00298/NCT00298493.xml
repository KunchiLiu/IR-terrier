	<brief_summary>All critically ill , mechanically ventilated patient Intensive Care Unit receive medication relieve pain anxiety . However , accumulation medication associate serious complication , notably long time breathe machine ICU . Two strategy show dramatically improve patient outcome : nurse-directed protocol give sedation , daily interruption sedation . However , strategy widely adopt , physician ' concern , unclear strategy well . Given patient outcome improve either strategy , fundamental question arise whether patient manage combination two strategy reduce drug accumulation ( protocolized sedation daily interruption ) even well outcome patient manage one ( protocolized sedation ) . We propose multicenter study 700 critically ill , mechanically ventilated patient sedation manage protocolized sedation alone , strategy . Both group patient follow record : ICU hospital length stay , mortality , total sedative drug use , ICU human resource use , side effect recall ICU stay . The result large multi-center trial help inform best practice regard sedation management critically ill patient Canada elsewhere . In addition , reduce ICU stay could economically attractive , cost ICU day Canada approximately $ 3000 .</brief_summary>
