	<brief_summary>The aim study test whether tailor multi-component intervention program increase activity general practice team prevention hazardous harmful alcohol consumption result increase advice give rate patient hazardous harmful alcohol consumption well patient outcome term hazardous harmful alcohol consumption . The primary objective propose study : 1. test ( cost ) effectiveness tailor multi-component implementation program engage general practice ( i.e . GPs , nurse practitioner practice nurses/assistants ) prevention hazardous harmful alcohol consumption , change provider ' advice give behaviour patient ' alcohol consumption 2. identify predictor effect 3. examine whether implementation tailor multi-component implementation program engage general practice prevention hazardous harmful alcohol consumption feasible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hazardous harmful alcohol consumption likely cause damage health , either physical mental . The prevention harmful alcohol consumption result reduction alcohol related disease , emergency hospital use , societal related problem , result direct health care saving well non-health care saving . General practice important set intervene patient whose drink hazardous harmful health . Despite evidence efficacy cost effectiveness case find brief intervention general practice , intervention rarely integrated routine practice . Based literature recommend develop tailor multi-component implementation program engage general practice prevention patient alcohol consumption . In trial tailor multi-component intervention program offer general practice team ( GPT ) . The participant trial GPT , patient . The GPTs practise Mid-West Mid-South invite participate trial invitational letter , include information leaflet . Participation obligatory , base interest GPT . Next , GPTs willing participate trial random allocate intervention control condition . Besides effect outcome measure describe 'Outcome measure '' part process cost measure describe . Besides measurement GPT-level , also conduct measurement patient level . All patient 18 year old visit GPT pre-defined 3-month period ask fill Alcohol Use Disorders identification Test ( AUDIT ) . This measurement take place intervention start . Only patient risk ask fill AUDIT intervention end . As described 'Outcome part ' , AUDIT use describe effect intervention program patient level . Patients receive individual feedback personal advice depend AUDIT score . Patients inform whether GPT allocate intervention program control condition ( usual care ) ( single blind ) . Comparison : GPTs participate multi-component intervention program ( see Interventions ; intervention group ) compare GPTs n't participate multi-component intervention program ( control group ) . The GPTs control group receive NHG guideline NHG patient information letter , see usual care . In addition receive feedback number patient risk alcohol consumption , see minimal intervention .</detailed_description>
