	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Rituxan With Methotrexate Etanercept Methotrexate Adalimumab Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist 4 part : screening , treatment , post-treatment , safety follow-up . Prior Day 1 , participant discontinue disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) except MTX etanercept adalimumab . All participant meet eligibility criterion enrol trial randomize receive 500 mg rituximab placebo Day 1 Day 15 . A subset 18 participant enrol initially follow Week 12 safety . The remain 42 participant enrol last participant subset complete Week 12 Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) conduct safety review approve enrollment additional participant . Participants dose Day 1 Day 15 follow 56 week , remain current dose MTX etanercept adalimumab throughout study . The primary endpoint assess Week 24 . All participant double-blind treatment , include receive placebo rituximab , meet open label inclusion/exclusion criterion anytime Week 24 Week 40 , eligible enter open label retreatment phase . These participant receive open label rituximab Day 1 Day 15 retreatment phase , follow monthly Week 24 every 2 month Week 56 , remain current dose MTX etanercept adalimumab throughout study . Participants receive 1 course open label treatment . All participant require return safety follow-up ( SFU ) assessments Weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 withdrawal completion study . Participants whose peripheral CD20+ B cell remain depleted end SFU period primary OL portion study enter extended safety follow-up ( ESFU ) . Assessments ESFU perform 12-week interval peripheral B-cell level return within normal range baseline level ( whichever low ) .</detailed_description>
