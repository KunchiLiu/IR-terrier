	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn autism subtypes . Autism developmental disorder child problem communication social skill display restricted interest repetitive behavior . This study several goal . One aim look type autism know , regressive subtype , ( skill lose ) . We explore whether unique change immune functioning related subtype . Another aim serve one sit pilot large natural history study , entitle Autism Phenome Project . The goal understand autism identify subtypes . We look several type medical issue may relate autism , include immunologic problem . Children follow course several year . We aim capture medical problem may relate autism develop , study outcome area behavior language , order explore know new subtypes autism . Normally develop child ( age 1 ) autism ( age 1 , developmental delay autism ( age 1 ) , may eligible study . Depending child 's study group age , participant may undergo follow test procedure : Baseline Visit - Medical developmental history , physical examination , psychological , cognitive medical test ass symptom autism developmental disorder , photograph child 's face , collection hair , urine baby teeth sample . If available , hair sample baby 's first haircut biological mother 's hair also collect . - Overnight electroencephalogram ( EEG ) : A special cap electrode place child 's head measure brain wave ( brain electrical activity ) child sleep hospital overnight . Healthy volunteer undergo procedure . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan : The child stay scanner , lie still 10 15 minute time . Since may difficult child lie still , test may schedule time child likely sleepy , child may sedate . - Lumbar puncture ( child autism ) . This test MRI may do sedation . Follow-Up Visits Follow-up visit schedule different interval , depend study group , age aspect study child enrol . The visit include short interview session child 's caregiver assessment child 's development behavior . Some assessment measure use baseline examination repeat , include symptom rating , behavioral test blood test . For child , final visit include repeat medical procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The current investigation focus find meaningful subtypes autism . Our objective include use comprehensive longitudinal medical assessment behavioral test find subgroups child autism profile comprise distinct biological/behavioral phenotype . Specific goal include determine unique alteration immune function among autistic child regressive clinical course , identify autism-specific sleep electroenchelalogram ( EEG ) abnormality , potential biomarkers . Study Population : We conduct longitudinal natural history study 140 child autism , 12 84 month age study entry . We also follow many 75 typically develop child , 50 child Developmental Delay serve age-/sex-matched control . Design : Systematic prospective evaluation utilized determine diagnostic functional outcome , evaluate behavioral , medical immunologic functioning . These evaluation include comprehensive medical history , behavioral assessment , physical neurologic examination , polysomnography ( PSG ) EEG , blood work laboratory assay . Baseline evaluation also include MRI lumbar puncture ( latter subject autism ) . In investigation behavioral outcomes potential biomarkers , repeat assessment necessary determine whether finding due state versus trait alteration . Thus , key element assessment repeat every 6 12 month , depend child age . Outcome Variables : Measures autism symptom severity , along cognitive adaptive behavior profile , use behavioral outcome variable . Results physical neurological examination , genetic testing , EEGs , polysomnograms , MRI scan laboratory assay blood CSF test utility biomarkers autism core symptom identification etiologically related subgroup patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : There 3 participant group study . AUT : Children autism ( diagnose autistic disorder accord DSMIV criterion ) . This group include child may dichotomize regression without regression . DD : Children nonspectrum developmental delay TYP : Children deem typically develop Accrual number include 140 child AUT group , 50 child DD group 75 child TYP group . AUT : Children include meet DSMIV criterion autistic disorder , base ADIR ADOS clinical judgment . Those meeting research criterion autism include . Regression define : Language loss : Loss least 3 spontaneously meaningful word ( exclude mama dada ) use least month , lose least month.AND/OR Nonverbal communication/social loss : Loss one nonverbal communicative behavior ( e.g . gesture , joint attention , eye contact , imagination , pretend play , share , show , watch child , orient name , social smiling , social game , spontaneous imitation action , response social overture ) . Although overlap age period regression specify protocol ( regression 1530 month ) describe childhood disintegrative disorder ( CDD ) ( DSMIV criterion indicate apparently normal development first 2 year birth ) , criterion CDD also indicate diagnosis make symptom well account another pervasive developmental disorder autism . Symptoms CDD separate autism include loss acquire skill area motor skill bowel bladder control , focus current study regression core symptom autism ( i.e . sociocommunicative skill ) . Thus , currently protocol include child regression 2 meet criterion autism , meet criterion CDD . DD : Developmental score ( Performance Quotient Verbal Quotient ) great 1.5 standard deviation mean Mullen Scales Early Learning TYP : No diagnosis developmental delay , firstdegree relative history autism spectrum disorder . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis cerebral palsy . For typical control , history extremely low birth weight ( due prematurity intrauterine growth failure ) . If behavioral management issue ( e.g . selfinjury , aggressiveness ) severe extent screen protocol abort .</criteria>
