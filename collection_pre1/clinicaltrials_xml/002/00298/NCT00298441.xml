	<brief_title>Efficacy Intravenous Iron Administration Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient chronic hemodialysis ( HD ) , anemia major complication associate poor clinical outcome . Consequently , management anemia recombinant erythropoietin report consistently improve outcome measure HD patient . Because iron essential hemoglobin formation , erythropoietin , patient routinely receive iron intravenously ( IVIR ) anemia correction . Although IVIR show improve survival quality life HD patient , suggest IVIR may enhance generation hydroxyl radical body inflammation process Fenton reaction . Previously demonstrate serum albumin highly oxidized HD patient IVIR patient significantly increase oxidation status albumin . In 2004 , committee guideline Japanese Society Dialysis Therapy ( JSDT ) publish original Japanese `` Guidelines Renal Anemia Chronic Hemodialysis Patients '' . In JSDT guideline 2004 , committee recommend two IVIR schedule iron deficient patient ; 1 ) administer 40 mg IV iron end dialysis session 3 time week 4 week ( total 520 mg iron ) , 2 ) administer 40 mg IV iron end dialysis session week 3 month ( total 520 mg iron ) . Both administration schedule effective correction iron deficiency consequently amelioration anemia . However , effect IVIR frequency ( three time week vs. week ) oxidative stress formation investigate . Comparison : two IVIR schedule recommend JSDT guideline 2004 compare measure hemoglobin oxidize albumin chronic HD patient .</detailed_description>
