	<detailed_description>The Contracts , Prompts , Social Reinforcement ( CPR ) intervention design address continue care adherence need veteran present substance use disorder ( SUD ) treatment . Final result recently complete HSR &amp; D clinical trial suggest CPR meaningfully impact aftercare adherence abstinence rate . Among CPR participant , 55 % meet VA 's SUD continuity care performance measure ( attend least 2 therapy session month 3 month ) , compare 36 % standard treatment ( STX ) . On primary outcome variable , 57 % participant CPR condition abstinent 1-year follow-up compare 37 % STX . Post hoc moderator analysis also indicate intervention particularly effective participant co-morbid psychiatric disorder . However , CPR impact abstinence rate earlier follow-up point , important measure treatment outcome , AA/NA support group attendance . Furthermore , generalizability CPR sit establish . Thus , intervention modify pilot test improve version CPR , include contingent reinforcement abstinence improve prompt AA/NA attendance ( CPR+ ) , show promise result . We conduct multi-site randomized clinical trial examine effectiveness CPR+ 2 specific goal : 1 ) compare CPR+ STX adherence continue care ( i.e. , AA/NA participation aftercare therapy ) 2 ) ass effect treatment outcome . We recruit 183 veteran seek residential treatment Salem Jackson VAMCs . Our primary hypothesis CPR group high 1-year abstinence rate compare STX group . Our secondary hypothesis CPR particularly effective individual co-morbid psychiatric disorder , CPR+ group remain AA/NA aftercare long duration , few day substance use , few hospitalization , low cost care . Treatment outcome measure 3- , 6- , 12-months participant enter treatment compare baseline level use Form-90 Interview , Addiction Severity Index ( ASI ) , questionnaire response , substance use screen . Treatment adherence measure use VA database , medical record , therapist rating , questionnaire response . Abstinence rate analyze use logistic regression model parameter interest estimate use Generalized Estimating Equations . Secondary outcomes analyze use marginal linear mixed-effects model appropriate . The current study seek extend past finding show longer-term effectiveness CPR+ intervention continue care adherence great impact treatment outcome . Dissemination implementation effort ongoing brief , inexpensive intervention , offer important mean improve participation outcome individual seek SUD treatment within VAMC .</detailed_description>
