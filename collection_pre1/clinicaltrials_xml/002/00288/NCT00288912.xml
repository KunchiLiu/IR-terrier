	<detailed_description>Background / Rationale : Osteoarthritis ( OA ) one common chronic condition among veteran , half VA health care user OA report limit daily activity joint symptom . However , study examine intervention improve outcome quality care among large grow number veteran OA . Telephone-based self-management intervention may cost-effective way improve pain , physical function , outcomes patient population . Objective : The purpose study examine effectiveness one-year telephone-based self-management intervention veteran hip knee OA . The primary hypothesis self-management intervention result great reduction pain compare usual care attention control condition . Methods : This randomize control trial 519 veteran Durham VAMC radiographic evidence physician diagnosis OA hip knee . Participants equally allocate self-management , attention control , usual care group . The self-management intervention design provide participant key information OA treatment enhance participant ' self-efficacy manage OA-related symptom . This intervention involve provision write , audio , video educational material , well monthly telephone call nurse . The nurse guide participant develop personal OA-related goal , well specific plan meeting goal . Other strategy enhance self-efficacy include model mastery self-management behavior , persuasion adopt behavior , reinterpretation OA symptom . The attention control group receive write material health screening relate topic ( OA-related ) , nurse call participant monthly basis discus material . The primary outcome measure study self-reported pain ( Arthritis Impact Measurement-2 ( AIMS2 ) subscale ) , secondary outcome self-reported function ( AIMS2 subscale ) , affect ( AIMS2 subscale ) , arthritis specific self-efficacy . Outcomes measured baseline follow one-year study period . Analysis covariance use compare primary secondary outcome intervention group control group , adjust baseline measure , participant demographic clinical characteristic . We also examine cost-effectiveness intervention . Impact : This study significant examines highly prevalent understudied chronic illness among veteran . In addition , OA self-management program contribute VA health care system 's specific mission improve pain management patient education participation . The propose self-management intervention low-cost easy disseminate within VA health care system . Therefore may important tool improve outcome , especially pain , among many veteran OA .</detailed_description>
