	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together paclitaxel carboplatin work treat patient metastatic melanoma . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Bortezomib may help paclitaxel carboplatin kill tumor cell make tumor cell sensitive drug</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine confirm tumor response rate adverse event profile bortezomib , carboplatin , paclitaxel first-line therapy patient metastatic melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . Evaluate time tumor progression , overall survival , duration response . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 2 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
