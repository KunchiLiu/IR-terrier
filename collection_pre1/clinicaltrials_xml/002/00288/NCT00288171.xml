	<detailed_description>The study double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover trial . We recruit 25 child age 6 18 year , pediatric renal transplant program Texas Children 's Hospital . The study consist three phase , screen phase , treatment phase , crossover phase . Clinical study design : The study double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover trial . We recruit 25 child age 6 18 year , pediatric renal transplant program Texas Children 's Hospital . The study consist three phase , screen phase , treatment phase , crossover phase . Laboratory Measurements : The laboratory measurement perform CLIA approve , clinical laboratory Texas Children 's Hospital . Definition high blood pressure : We use guideline blood pressure measurement adapt Update Task Force Report ( 1987 ) High Blood Pressure Children Adolescents [ 22 ] . Hypertension define &gt; 95th percentile blood pressure age , height percentile ( rounded nearest 5th , 10th , 25th , 50th , 75th , 90th , 95th percentile height patient actual height ) gender . Each blood pressure measurement mean 3 right arm reading , take mercury sphygmomanometer least three minute apart patient sit upright relaxed . For purpose study , define hypertensive , patient need mean systolic diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95th percentile three consecutive occasion , separate day least 1 week period . Patients previously confirm hypertension reconfirm screening period . Screening phase : The screening phase last 1 2 week . Patients taught use digital blood pressure monitor appropriately size cuff instruct perform daily blood pressure measurement keep blood pressure log . Blood test do determine eligibility base clinical laboratory parameter . Girls post-menarche urine pregnancy test . Each child undergo 24hr ambulatory blood pressure monitor screen phase . Children collect urine 24-hours purpose screen urinary nitrate bradykinin . Phase 1 : The active phase last six week include clinic visit first day phase , laboratory test day 4 7 , weekly telephone contact throughout phase . Subjects receive allopurinol placebo . Laboratory test perform 4 7 day start medication screen hepatic bone marrow toxicity ( AST , ALT , CBC ) , renal function ( Cr ) , cyclosporin tacrolimus level serum uric acid . Evidence toxicity , increase creatinine unstable cyclosporin level lead immediate discontinuation allopurinol withdrawal study . The family also instruct continue daily blood pressure log start screen phase . At end phase , prior discontinuation allopurinol , child undergo 24hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring . Children repeat 24-hour urine collection purpose screen urinary nitrate bradykinin . Washout Phase : There two-week washout interval allopurinol placebo phase . Crossover Phase : The crossover phase identical procedure active phase except child receive allopurinol placebo , whichever receive Phase 1 .</detailed_description>
