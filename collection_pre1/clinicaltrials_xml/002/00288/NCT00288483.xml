	<brief_summary>Despite undeniable progress reduction morbidity mortality coronary heart disease ( CHD ) prevention mainstay medical intervention . The importance elevate serum cholesterol formation progress CHD regard prove result major intervention study become available . These study provide key evidence positive correlation lipid lowering decrease mortality . Other study patient establish CHD show stabilization regression atherosclerotic lesion possible lower cholesterol use variety agent . Different study also investigate long-term effect lipid lower strategy atherosclerosis mean coronary angiography demonstrate lipid reduction reduces progression atherosclerosis promote atherosclerosis regression . Thus , demonstrate cholesterol lower therapy reduces risk CHD diminishes cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Policosanol drug presumably possess hypocholesterolemic antiplatelet effect . Furthermore hint even positive effect influence development atherosclerosis , i.e . inhibition LDL peroxidation smooth muscle cell proliferation . Previous study show efficacy dose range mostly 5 20 mg Policosanol per day . As nearly previous study perform Latin America exclude either ethnic nutritional factor contribute dose find optimal region . This circumstance well requirement meet ICH Guideline “ Ethnic Factors Acceptability Foreign Clinical Data ” make study , i.e . dose-finding clinical trial , efficacy clinical trial European patient long-term tolerability clinical trial Caucasian patient necessary . It know 60 clinical study perform far Policosanol excellent safety profile . A placebo-controlled design consider appropriate patient two risk factor development cardiovascular event LDL great 190 mg/dl exclude ; chance get active lipid-lowering agent treatment phase 80 % .</brief_summary>
