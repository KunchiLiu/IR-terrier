	<brief_summary>Background : - Melanocytic nevus , `` mole , '' non-cancerous growth type skin cell call melanocyte . - Large congenital melanocytic nevus ( LCMN ) special type mole begin grow birth large mole develop birth . - Determining melanocyte mole LCMNs differ normal melanocyte may increase ability predict whether mole give rise melanoma ( type skin cancer ) Objectives : - To understand melanoma develop , study mole , LCMNs , pigment skin lesion suspicious melanoma - To develop good criterion diagnose melanoma , particularly use device call digital dermatoscope ( special camera , connect computer , take picture mole magnified illuminate ) Eligibility : - Children 5 year old old LCMN - Adults 18 year old old 100 mole large 2 mm diameter least one 4 mm - Adults 18 year old old pigment lesion suspicious melanoma Design : - Patients ' personal family health history obtain . - Patients examine investigative team doctor , several lesion examine dermatoscope . - Additional photograph part skin surface may take . - Some lesion may biopsied . - Additional test examination may recommend . - Patients follow periodically skin physical examination , photography , laboratory imaging evaluation , possible skin biopsy . - Children may undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study understand early transformation malignant progression event cutaneous melanoma obtain detailed clinical information lesional tissue analysis , cell culture , immortalization patient melanocytic nevus , frequently precursor lesion melanoma , primary melanoma . An important goal study acquisition melanocyte lager congential melanocytic nevus ( LCMN ) acquire melanocytic nevus ( AMN ) analysis , culture experimental manipulation . We propose acquire melanocyte pigment lesion suspect represent primary melanoma importance preserve lesional tissue require render accurate histopathological diagnosis . However , another aim study development enhance clinical criterion diagnosis primary cutaneous melanoma , particularly use digital epiluminescent skin microscopy , dermoscopy , pigment lesion image acquisition analysis . The close comparison dermoscopic image pigment skin lesion suspicious melanoma lesional histopathology useful expand knowledge base dermoscopy , relatively new technique use evaluate pigmented skin lesion , use diagnose pigmented skin lesion benign malignant . These detailed comparison may also provide information specific visual feature within dermoscopic image field correlate histologic feature lesion . This information may useful future possible study design predict accurately portion primary malignant melanoma remove esperimental study retain sufficient lesional information guide treatment render accurate prognosis . The study population consist three category patient : ( 1 ) infant child large congenital melanocytic nevus , ( 2 ) adult numerous ( less 100 ) melanocytic nevus , ( 3 ) patient primary malignant melanoma . Establishment Pigmented Lesion Clinic require execution protocol provide mechanism evaluation patient numerous unusual pigment lesion , entry eligible patient ongoing therapeutic trial malignant melanoma . As study progress , anticipate substantial amount formalin-fixed nevus primary melanoma tissue high-degree clinical annotation collect . As secondary objective , availability collection useful support study design evaluate new marker technique diagnosis melanoma atypical nevus , incorporation tissue microarray available melanoma research community target foundation validation . Background : The molecular event result melanocyte transformation development early melanoma incompletely understood . Risk factor development melanoma include genetic , phenotypic environmental risk factor overlap . Also , person large number nevi face high risk melanoma . These risk association , combine knowledge obtain basic study survival , differentiation , proliferation melanocyte , provide hint molecular mechanism underlie development nevus melanoma . In study plan acquire lesional tissue pigment lesion develop enhanced clinical criterion diagnosis primary cutaneous melanoma , particularly use digital epiluminescent skin microscopy , dermoscopy , pigment lesion image acquisition analysis . This information may useful future possible study design predict accurately portion primary malignant melanoma remove experimental study retain sufficient lesional information guide treatment render accurate prognosis . Objectives : To obtain tissue benign melanocytic nevus large congenital melanocytic nevus ( LCMN ) experimental study . To refine culture immortalization method melanocytes derive melanocytic nevus , permit vitro expansion cell functional study . To correlate clinical dermoscopic observation primary melanoma histopathology establish standard sample primary melanoma possible future study . Eligibility : Infants/Children le 5 year age large congenital melanocytic nevus ( LCMN , diagnose clinically biopsy ) great 20 cm one dimension great 8 cm one dimension involve scalp . Adults great 18 year age great 100 melanocytic nevi great 2 mm diameter least one melanocytic nevus great 4 mm long dimension current pigment lesion clinically suspicious primary melanoma . Design : This natural history protocol design enroll 110 subject evaluate follow course disease .</detailed_description>

Diagnosis genetic syndrome associate multiple lentigo nevus ( PeutzJeghers syndrome , Carney complex , turner syndrome , Noonan 's syndrome ) . Two firstdegree relative history cutaneous melanoma familial atypical molemelanoma syndrome phenotype . Diagnosis cancerassociated syndrome ( xeroderma pigmentosum , type I neurofibromatosis , LiFraumeni syndrome ) . Inability tolerate surgical procedure due bleed diathesis disorder cause determine principal investigator . Patient unwilling consider elective biopsy melanocytic nevus .</criteria>
