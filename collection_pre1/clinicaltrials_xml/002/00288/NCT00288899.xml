The surgical procedure study include carotid endarterectomy , total hip arthroplasty , radical prostatectomy laparoscopic cholecystectomy . The study link National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data provide baseline data patient characteristic , intraoperative variable ( e.g . operation type , time , anesthesia method , etc . ) , data 30 day surgical outcome . We assess endpoint include patient comprehension , patient satisfaction consent process , patient anxiety , provider ' acceptance inform consent process , patient satisfaction health care decision make use validate self-report survey instrument .
