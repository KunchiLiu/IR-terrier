	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose fenretinide see well work give together rituximab treat patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , fenretinide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some find cancer cell kill carry cancer-killing substance . Others interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Giving fenretinide together rituximab may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fenretinide Rituximab Treating Patients With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety fenretinide deliver 5 7 day regimen . ( Phase I ) II . To estimate efficacy ( response rate ) fenretinide + rituximab patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform pharmacokinetic study patient receive fenretinide . ( Phase I ) II . To determine intratumoral concentration fenretinide . ( Phase I ) III . To evaluate vivo mechanism action fenretinide . ( Phase I ) IV . To identify predictor response fenretinide . ( Phase I ) V. To estimate response rate , positron emission tomography ( PET ) response , overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , time progression ( TTP ) , disease-free survival ( DFS ) patient treat study . ( Phase I ) VI . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , time progression ( TTP ) , disease-free survival ( DFS ) , PET responses patient treat study . ( Phase II ) VII . To perform pharmacokinetic study patient receive fenretinide . ( Phase II ) VIII . To determine intratumoral concentration fenretinide . ( Phase II ) IX . To identify predictor response fenretinide fenretinide + rituximab B-NHL . ( Phase II ) X . To evaluate vivo mechanism action fenretinide B-NHL . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study fenretinide follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive fenretinide orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-5 . Treatment repeat weekly least 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients receive fenretinide PO BID day 1-5 week 1-8 rituximab intravenously ( IV ) weekly week 5-8 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
