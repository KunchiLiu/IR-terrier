	<brief_summary>Chemoresponse assay ( lab test ) measure effect chemotherapy treatment patient 's cancer cell lab . This test show success retrospective study predict individual patient 's tumor respond give chemotherapy treatment utilizing agent test say patient 's cell would sensitive corresponds long progression free interval . This study determine ability two test use predict success chemotherapy recurrent , persistent , refractory cancer ovary , fallopian tube ( ) peritoneum measure long patient live without progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Chemoresponse Assay With PFS Patients With Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian , Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The traditional treatment course new case ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer cytoreductive surgery follow chemotherapy paclitaxel combination carboplatin . Unfortunately , despite high initial response rate , majority patient recur subsequent therapy much less likely effective . The use ineffective chemotherapy result unnecessary toxicity cost , delay effective treatment , potential development cross-resistance additional drug . The ability individualize therapy provide treat physician ex vivo response information panel drug aid selection effective therapy individual patient , thus result improve outcome . Resistance chemotherapy predict either clinical histological examination . Historically , ex vivo sensitivity resistance tumor cell evaluate tool predict clinical response patient therapy . In study , chemotherapy drug test use Precision Therapeutics ' ChemoFx Assay Yale Apoptosis Assay . The assay result compare clinical outcome report regular interval . Blood , tumor pathology slide , excess tumor cell ( available ) use characterize common polymorphisms drug metabolizing enzymes well molecular marker potentially associate tumor response . This one-arm validation trial goal approximately 256 evaluable patient recruit multiple site . Patients draw Yale -New Haven Medical Center multiple additional site need meet accrual goal . The patient treat FDA approve drug and/or drug combination base medical judgment treat physician . The study randomize result assay used decision process agent select treatment , make available treat physician upon progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient diagnose persistent , refractory , recurrent epithelial ovarian , peritoneal , fallopian tube carcinoma . Patient must document disease defined physical exam , clinically significant increase CA125 ( define protocol ) , CT , MRI scan , PET , xray ultrasound cytoreduction , excisional biopsy , incisional biopsy , paracentesis medically indicate , alternative , agree core biopsy primary site , secondary metastatic site , paracentesis thoracentesis fluid collection . Patient disease one follow histologic epithelial cell type : serous adenocarcinoma , endometrioid adenocarcinoma , mucinous adenocarcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , transitional cell carcinoma , clear cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma , otherwise specify ( N.O.S. ) . Cytologic confirmation diagnosis acceptable patient treat neoadjuvant therapy surgical procedure histologic confirmation . Patient receive one two prior chemotherapy regimen ovarian , peritoneal , fallopian tube carcinoma . Multiple previous regimen Taxol/Carboplatin count 1 prior chemotherapy regimen ( e.g. , A patient receive first line Taxol/Carboplatin , recurs , receive Taxol/Carboplatin consider 1 prior regimen . ) Patient must complete prior chemotherapy regimen least 3 week prior tissue extraction . Patient must estimate life expectancy great six month , determine investigator . Patient require chemotherapy investigator plan administer one regimens interest deem physician . Patient must female least 18 year age . Ovarian cancer disease occur woman exceedingly rare female age 18 . Patient must ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 . Tumor tissue ascitic fluid must available assay . Ascites Pleural alone may collect submitted sample tissue , patient must also measurable disease demonstrate CA125 level 2X ULN measurable lesion image eligible . Patient must sign approve consent form . Patient ovarian stromal , mixed mullerian , germ cell tumor Patient borderline carcinoma ( uncertain malignant potential ) Pregnant lactate patient Patients childbearing potential employ adequate contraception . Patients risk failure compliance visit schedule procedure . The investigator plan use assay select chemotherapy drug regimen . The investigator may submit patient 's tissue testing assay , may use result assay select chemotherapy regimen patient trial . Patients synchronous primary endometrial cancer past history primary endometrial cancer exclude unless follow condition meet : Stage great IB , Less 3mm invasion without vascular lymphatic invasion , NO poorly differentiate subtype , include papillary serous , clear cell , othe FIGO Grade 3 lesion .</criteria>
