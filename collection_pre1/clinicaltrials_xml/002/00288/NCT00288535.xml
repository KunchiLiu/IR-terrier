	<brief_title>Treatment Bifurcated Coronary Lesions With Cypher™-Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bifurcations involve significant side branch ( SB diameter ≥ 2.25 mm ) occur approximately 15-20 % coronary lesion consider percutaneous intervention . If side branch ( SB ) subtend significant myocardium , failure preserve SB vessel patency lead complication myocardial infarction persistent chest pain despite full patency main branch . Bifurcation lesion inherently complex interventional treatment remain challenge problem physician . The optimal technique stenting bifurcate lesion still unknown . Several dual vessel stenting technique describe literature , `` T '' , `` V '' , `` Y '' , `` Culotte '' `` Crush '' procedure . However , study bifurcation stenting find optimal long-term result obtain stenting main vessel perform plain balloon angioplasty side branch ( `` kiss balloon '' -technique ) . Nevertheless , occlusion reduce flow SB frequent stenting MB . Therefore , SB stented approximately 50 % procedure even PTCA alone intend . Hypothesis : Compared plain dilatation side branch , placement Cypher-Stent side branch use modify T-stenting technique reduce `` in-segment percent diameter stenosis '' side branch 9 month post procedure measure quantitative coronary angiography .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The target vessel must meet following criterion : 1 . Bifurcated lesion Type 1 , 2 , 3 4 native coronary artery reference vessel diameter 2.5 mm 4.0 mm main branch ≥ 2.25 mm side branch . 2 . The target lesion ( main branch / side branch ) must least 50 % diameter stenosis . 3 . The target lesion previously treat interventional procedure . 4 . The target vessel ( main branch side branch ) must feasible stent implantation ( successful passage guide wire ; successful predilatation appropriately sized balloon ; heavy calcification ; diffuse distal disease might impede run ) . 2 . Patient stable unstable angina pectoris ( CCS classification I great ) positive stress test ischemia . 3 . Patient must ≥ 18 year age . 4 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day procedure . 5 . Patient treatment plan within 30 day procedure . 6 . Patient informed nature study agree provision write informed consent approve Ethics Committee . 7 . Patient willing comply require postprocedure followup . 1 . Patient acute myocardial infarction ( &gt; 3x normal CK presence CKMB ) within 72 hour precede index procedure CK return normal limit time procedure . 2 . Patient known hypersensitivity contraindication aspirin , heparin , clopidogrel , stainless steel , sirolimus , contrast sensitivity adequately premedicated . 3 . Patient platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm³ &gt; 700,000 cells/mm³ , WBC &lt; 3,000 cells/mm³ , document suspect liver disease . 4 . Patient history bleed diathesis coagulopathy . 5 . Patient suffer CVA TIA within past six month . 6 . Active peptic ulcer upper GI bleeding within prior 6 month . 7 . Patient comorbidity ( i.e . cancer congestive heart failure ) may cause patient noncompliant protocol , associate limited life expectancy ( less 2 year ) . 8 . Patient must exclude study angiographic criterion meet : 1 . The target vessel contain intraluminal thrombus . 2 . The target lesion locate leave main coronary artery . 3 . The target lesion vessel show angiographic evidence severe calcification . 4 . The patient undergone previous PCI target vessel within 6 month . 5 . Pre treatment lesion do technique balloon angioplasty ( e.g . rotablation ) .</criteria>
