	<brief_summary>This project propose evaluate relative effectiveness four therapy protocol pharyngeal phase swallow impairment stroke population . Data derive study contribute significantly understanding rehabilitative process neurogenic dysphagic population provide foundation establishment efficacious , cost-efficient patient service . 1 . Research Question address 1 . The utilization SEMG biofeedback monitoring dysphagia rehabilitation facilitate rapid complete recovery traditional rehabilitation use swallow exercise without exteroceptive feedback . 2 . Swallowing rehabilitation provide intensive rehabilitative programme ( 10 hr treatment 1st week ) facilitate rapid complete recovery traditionally schedule swallowing rehabilitation ( twice weekly ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-site , multi-national project evaluate relative effectiveness four therapy protocol pharyngeal phase swallow impairment stroke population . For study , patient chronic dysphagia secondary stroke assign one four treatment protocol . These four protocol differ respect intensity treatment inclusion surface electromyography ( SEMG ) biofeedback adjunct treatment . All patient complete total 30 hour therapy data collection ass progress interval every 10 session . Treatment outcomes measure use combination physiologic behavioral measure . Data derive study contribute significantly understanding rehabilitative process neurogenic dysphagic population provide foundation establishment efficacious , cost-efficient patient service .</detailed_description>
