	<brief_summary>The use intravenous immunoglobulin G ( IVIG ) therapy report hyperbilirubinemia Rh hemolytic disease n't enough evidence . Human Immunoglobulin consider alternative delay hemolytic process consequently reduce number exchange transfusion transfusion red cell concentrate , thus diminish risk transmit transfusional therapies-related disease . OBJECTIVE : To determine effect IVIG decrease incidence severity neonatal immune hemolytic jaundice due Rh hemolytic disease reduce need exchange transfusion primary goal baby . METHODS : This randomize , double blind , clinical trial involve newborn risk significant hyperbilirubinemia due direct Coombs-positive Rh hemolytic disease . The primary goal need exchange transfusion others : incidence late anemia , kernicterus deafness Babies randomly assign two group : group 1 ( study group ) receive phototherapy plus IVIG ( 500 mg/kg ) ; group 2 ( control group ) receive phototherapy normal saline solution ( 10 ml/Kg ) first 6 hour life . Exchange transfusion carry group time bilirubin level reach 340 micromol/l ( 20 mg/dl ) , rise 8.5 micromol/l per h ( 0.5 mg/dl per h ) . Adverse effect relate two group . Parents informed consent ask pre-natal time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Hemolytic Anemia due Rh alloimmunization characterize hemolysis Rh ( D ) fetal red cell cause action anti Rh ( D ) maternal antibody fetal circulation . The perinatal hemolytic disease due Rh alloimmunization almost extinct world . The administration Specific Human Immunoglobulin prevent sensitization process introduce perinatal care pregnant woman , reduces incidence case Rh alloimmunization . Unfortunately Brazil effective policy gear reduce perinatal hemolytic disease consequence thus incidence condition continue high . The conventional treatment include phototherapy exchange transfusion . The advantage exchange transfusion Rh hemolytic disease well defined risk remain high mortality rate related procedure range around 2 % morbimortality ( thrombocytopenia , thrombosis portal vein , necrotizing enterocolitis , metabolic disorder infection ) reach 12 % . The procedure require availability compatible blood , team appropriate training procedure neonatal ICU infrastructure prepare prevent admission newborn whose mother go prophylaxis . The use immunoglobulin associate phototherapy may reduce need exchange transfusion , thus allow sensitize newborn receive treatment therefore avoid neurological damage associate hemolytic disease . If high incidence disease , difficulty risk involved exchange transfusion , difficulty obtain Rh negative blood take consideration , become clear important conducting study prove effectiveness immunoglobulin case . General Objective To determine effect IVIG decrease incidence severity neonatal immune hemolytic jaundice due Rh hemolytic disease reduce need exchange transfusion primary goal baby . Specific Objectives 1 . To asses administration immunoglobulin newborn hyperbilirubinemia cause alloimmunization Rh ( D ) hemolytic anemia : 1 . Reduces need phototherapy 2 . Reduces length phototherapy treatment 3 . Reduces need number exchange transfusion 4 . Reduces time hospitalization 2 . To evaluate risk patient receive immunoglobulin side effect administration . 3 . To evaluate incidence late anemia sequela hyperbilirubinemia ( deafness , development retardation , cholestasis kernicterus ) first year life . 4 . To evaluate Ig-G subclass presence anti-HLA antibody paternal blood cell group newborn study relation clinical response immunoglobulin . Methodology This randomize double-blind clinical trial essay . The mother approach prenatal treatment , diagnose carrier hemolytic disease due Rh alloimmunization . The research present mother/family invite participate study . The informed consent term present mother/family allow time decide . If accept study receive questionnaire issue relate possible reason sensitization . After obtain free inform consent parent , sensitize newborn randomize 2 group , 1:1 proportion . The study group receive Human Immunoglobulin ( Immunoglobulin® - 50mg/ml ) dose 500mg/kg , equivalent 10ml/kg initial 6hours life , intravenous infusion 2 hour ; control group receive volume saline solution 0.09 % . All newborn include study grant conventional supplementary treatment include indication exchange transfusion phototherapy , accord specific criterion recommend American Academy Pediatrics 2004 . The criterion apply equally group . The study monitor individually allow interrupt important side effect occur anaphylactic reaction result give group significantly good inclusion new subject research , accord size sample case drug yield desire beneficial effect . An independent neonatologist , previously choose , check undesirable side effect partially monitor result study . The report undesirable effect conduct case ; two intermediate evaluation result research conduct . The Committee Ethics Research inform every non-expected undesired effect relate medication study need interrupt research . Sample Size : The calculated size sample , consider reduction 30 % indication exchange transfusion , statistical significance 95 % test power 80 % 90 newborn . An investigator approach pregnant woman and/or parent/responsible baby potentially eligible study deliver consent term . Randomization blind The randomization perform draw block different size . In order avoid health professional nursery know product infuse newborn ( Immunoglobulin Saline Solution 0.9 % ) syringe require volume prepared pharmacy wrap aluminum foil . The color product similar . The newborn monitor clinically followed-up , two group equally receive infusion . All clinical change cardiac respiratory frequency hemoglobin saturation record infusion two group . All newborn , procedure , submit Glucose dosage screen method ( Blood sugar test ) . Complementary treatment The complementary treatment administer secure newborn admit study follow protocol : Indication exchange transfusion The baby exchange transfusion birth would indicate excluded study . The indication exchange transfusion birth : - Bilirubin umbilical cord superior equal 4 mg % - Fetal hydrops congestive heart failure due serious anemia . The exchange transfusion indicate follow newborn birth , accord exist literature present follow feature : - Bilirubin level rise 0.5mg/dl per hour despite phototherapy - Hyperbilirubinemia , accord APP directive . Indication Phototherapy All newborns receive phototherapy begin first 6 hour life The procedure adopt triple phototherapy place 50cms away newborn ; irradiance device measure every day . Indication blood transfusion : The newborn present condition mention indicated receive reed blood transfusion volume 15ml/kg , accord criterion : 1 . Hematocrit level 25 % positive direct indirect Coombs Hematocrit level 21 % , negative direct indirect Coombs 2 . Reticulocytes - less 1 % 3 . Hematocrit level 30 % accompanied clinical sign severe anemic . Auditory Evoked Potential All newborns involve study undergo non-invasive hearing test , occasion hospital discharge first time go ambulatory follow-up . The application hearing evoke potential indicated isoimmunized newborn routinely perform local study take place . Follow-up hospital discharge All newborns followed-up Follow-Up Ambulatory first year life , laboratorial follow-up conduct ( Hematocrit/Coombs ) well complete physical neurological examination . The Bayley method use neurological evaluation , perform trained professional end first year life . Every fact relate clinical evolution first year life record : presence cholestasis , nutritional situation ( evaluation ) z-score time hospital discharge , 6th month end first year , regard weight , height head perimeter , use NCHS standard ; hospital admittance blood transfusion treatment , presence infection might relate use blood derivates ( hepatitis B C , cytomegalovirus ) . Laboratorial Tests The laboratorial exam perform base maternal sample , draw pre-natal period sample newborn , draw birth ( blood umbilical cord ) heel puncture withdrawal 2 capillary tube . These capillary centrifuge total bilirubin measure Bilirubin Meter B105 , ERMA INC. ) . The technician perform exam aware allocate group patient examination . 1 . Determination ABO blood group mother- direct reversal proof- technique vial BIOTEST reagent . 2 . Determination ABO blood group newborn - 3 . Determination maternal fetal Rho ( D ) factor - Technique vial use anti-D monoclonal saline solution BIOTEST Rh control saline solution . 4 . Research irregular antibody P.A I - phase immediate reading , proteic phase 37º - technique vial BIOTEST reagent sensitize red cell-test ( Coombs control ) BIOTEST 5 . Identification Irregular Antibodies - technique perform reagent albuminous Coombs vial Panel phenotyped red cell sensitize red cell ( Combs Control ) BIOTEST 6 . Dosage irregular antibody maternal serum phenotyped red cell newborn 7 . Research anti-A anti-B IgG blood serum Rh negative alloimmunized , blood type `` O '' positive mother . 8 . Direct test human immunoglobulin ( Direct Coombs ) sample NB - technique perform vial BIOTEST reagent . 9 . Classification IgG subclasses - immunoenzymatic test ( ELISA ) 10 . Research anti-HLA antibody paternal blood cell . Data analysis : The data store attached worksheet analyze use statistical method compare result laboratorial exams presence absence exchange transfusion hospital stay among child give intravenous immunoglobulin . These test take consideration sample randomize block . The observation also conduct stratify group , follow : premature baby , non-premature baby , baby undergo intra-uterus transfusion .
