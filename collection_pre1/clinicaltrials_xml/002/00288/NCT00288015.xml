	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well bevacizumab work treat patient angiosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Angiosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine median progression-free survival , term stable disease , patient newly diagnose recurrent/refractory angiosarcoma treat bevacizumab . Secondary - Evaluate treatment effect bevacizumab objective response rate assess modify RECIST criterion patient angiosarcoma . - Evaluate duration response . - Assess treatment effect bevacizumab duration overall survival . - Explore objective response target tumor density change CT scan . - Evaluate safety tolerability bevacizumab patient angiosarcoma . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 4 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 31 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
