	<brief_summary>Recent study show 25 – 30 % depressed patient never fully recover , result treatment-resistant condition . Thus , depression major cause human suffering . We interest find new way identify alleviate treatment-resistant depression , believe recent advance brain image contribute achieve goal . In project , use novel compound ( [ N-methyl-11C ] mirtazapine ) invent examine neurochemistry brain receptor involve antidepressant action . Our compound , [ N-methyl-11C ] mirtazapine , closely relate clinically effective antidepressant drug mirtazapine ( Remeron® ) . It label several type noradrenergic receptor often implicate “ stress reaction ” well depressive disorder . We believe compound identify specific molecular brain dysfunction causally relate treatment-resistant depression . The purpose study determine whether reliable relationship level mirtazapine bloodstream occupancy neuroreceptors mirtazapine brain . We apply standard procedure PET brain scan region-of-interest data analysis , use healthy volunteer receive daily dose mirtazapine ( double-blind design placebo , 7.5 mg 15 mg daily 5 day ) . We believe project could provide procedure assess brain function treatment-resistant depression , aim improve guideline successful , evidence-based treatment depression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project use double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group design determine whether reliable relationship level antidepressant drug mirtazapine bloodstream degree occupancy neuroreceptors brain healthy human volunteer . The primary data endpoint study bind potential C-11 label racemic mirtazapine brain baseline condition 5 day ingestion either placebo tablet table contain 7.5 mg 15 mg mirtazapine . The degree receptor occupancy obtain experimental condition calculate basis binding potential brain region use data obtain positron emission tomography ( PET scan ) . Blood sample obtain time PET scan order determine whether reliable correlation concentration mirtazapine bloodstream degree receptor occupancy achieve brain . The study plan include 24 healthy volunteer 8 subject three group ( placebo , 7.5 mg mirtazapine , 15 mg mirtazapine ) . Subjects randomize group way three treatment use three consecutive subject enter study . This procedure reduce possibility difference procedure might occur time introduce bias result . Radiosynthesis ( C-11 ) mirtazapine occur authorize documented procedure currently establish PET Center Aarhus University Hospital .</detailed_description>
