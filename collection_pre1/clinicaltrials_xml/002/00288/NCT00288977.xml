	<brief_title>Islet Transplantation Type 1 Diabetic Recipients Kidney Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial design replicate protocol currently test Immune Tolerance Network ( ITN ) population patient previously transplant ( recipient function renal allograft ) therefore immunosuppressed . The data generate use substantially identical technique islet preparation , transplantation additional islet meet minimum islet cell mass , identical steroid-free post-transplant regimen utilize sirolimus , low dose tacrolimus , daclizumab . 3.1 . Primary secondary endpoint additional measure Study efficacy endpoint additional measure describe follow subsection . Measures relate islet preparation quality ( Section 3.1.3 ) variable relate key cellular genetic marker ( Section 3.1.4 ) follow study consider clinical outcome variable . Details describe requirement efficacy test find Section 6.1 . Safety measure describe Section 7 . 3.1.1 . Primary endpoint The primary endpoint study independence insulin injection adequate control blood glucose subject Type 1 diabetes one year post final transplant . Subjects consider success one year assessment use insulin , HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % achieve fasting glucose level exceed 7.8 mmol/L ( 140 mg/dL ) three time week ( use morning fast glucose level ) , exceed two hour post-prandial ( use post meal glucose level ) value 10 mmol/L ( 180 mg/dL ) four time week . A subject still consider success intercurrent illness event ( e.g. , high tacrolimus level ) cause participant require insulin use period exceed total 14 day , assessment event demonstrate insulin independence adequate glucose control define . This assessment must complete later two week schedule one year assessment . 3.1.2 . Secondary parameter Secondary parameter support primary goal investigation assess generally interval primary endpoint , take less frequently indicate detail Sections 5.2 6.1 . Additional clinical measurement also take study consider endpoint formal analysis , carefully follow part study . The schedule additional element list Sections 5.2 , 6.2 7.2 . The secondary variable include follow measure : 1 . Basal C-peptide level 2 . HbA1C level 3 . Glucose tolerance 4 . C-peptide response arginine 5 . MAGE improvement 6 . Mixed Meal Test 7 . Durability insulin independence adequate blood glucose control 3.1.3 . Islet quality endpoint Islet cell preparation transplant assess use follow element : 1 . Islet yield per isolation use clinical transplantation , express ) total islet equivalent ii ) islet equivalent per kg recipient body weight . 2 . Islet viability , assess fluorescent dye inclusion/exclusion assay assess metabolic activity membrane integrity . 3 . In vitro islet responsiveness glucose challenge , measure 2-hour static incubation follow 12-24 hour culture 37º C CMRL 1066 ( 10 % FCS , 25 mmol HEPES ) . A stimulation index , ratio insulin secretion high glucose insulin secretion low basal secretion calculate index islet function . 4 . Islet cell immunohistochemical composition purity assessment , ( determine JDRF Center Islet Transplantation Harvard Medical School - Islet Morphology Core Laboratory ) 5 . Evidence microbial contamination , document negative Gram stain islet preparation immediately pre-transplant , negative microbial culture report least 5 day incubation aerobe , anaerobe , fungi . 6 . Evidence low endotoxin content final islet preparation . 3.1.4 . Cellular genetic marker Samples collect transplant immunologic study process laboratory Dr. Terry Strom Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Dr. Mohamed Sayegh Brigham Women 's Hospital . These include : 1 . Alteration autoimmune marker GAD65 , ICA512 , mIAA , compare blood sample draw pre-transplant 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 36 month final transplant . 2 . Changes autoantibody immune marker compare blood sample draw pre-transplant 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 month final transplant 3 . Samples also take future laboratory genetic study compare blood sample draw pre-transplant usually 3 , 6 , 12 month final transplant . 3.2 . Description trial design schematic diagram procedure stage Because open-label , single-arm study , schematic diagram design omit simplicity . For general description trial design , please refer Section 2 . A tabular listing visit schedule test find Appendix 1 . 3.3 . Measures minimize bias This study open-label feasibility study definitive clinical endpoint insulin independence , blood glucose C peptide production measure procedural success . As donor islet become available appropriate ABO compatible blood type match eligible participant . Clinical investigator mask treatment assignment follow assessment information pilot study . 3.4 . Description trial treatment dosage regimen &amp; label Each islet cell transplantation procedure protocol derive individual donor pancreas , process immediate transplantation . All container component appropriately label preparation . Each final islet preparation release use label indicate identity date preparation . Records regard donor identity keep coded manner quality control purpose keep absolutely confidential accordance standard procedure . 3.4.1 . Islet Infusion ( ) A target total &gt; 10,000 IE/kg recipient body weight infused via percutaneous transhepatic catheter insert portal vein ( see Section 1.4.2 ) . This likelihood require one islet infusion achieve goal . The first infusion must contain least 5,000 IE/kg recipient body weight . In event subject achieve insulin-independence normoglycemia two fresh islet infusion , third transplant may consider described Section 5.1 . 3.4.2 . Immunosuppressive Therapy Beginning initial transplant , immunosuppressive regimen administer subject . Subjects receive initial dos daclizumab , sirolimus , low dose tacrolimus accord follow schedule . 3.4.2.1 . Daclizumab regimen Daclizumab administer dose 1 mg/kg peripheral IV give immediately pre-transplant , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 week transplant , total 5 dos ( 8 week ) . If subsequent islet infusion require beyond induction period , 5 dose course daclizumab give accord schedule . If second ( third ) transplant occur daclizumab give precede 7 day , dose regimen begin time transplant . If daclizumab administer within past 7 day , dose transplant omit , first dose give 2 week post transplant . 3.4.2.2 . Sirolimus regimen All patient enrol trial already Sirolimus therapy . If need , dose increase 0.1 mg/kg/day PO adjust target range 12-15 ng/ml 3 month follow recent islet infusion . After three month follow last transplant , target whole blood level lower 7-10ng/mL . 3.4.2.3 . Tacrolimus regimen All patient enrol trial already Tacrolimus therapy . As soon trough level available , dose adjust target range 3-6 ng/ml throughout study .</detailed_description>
