	<brief_summary>Inflammatory symptom Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome ( CAPS ) due mutation NLRP-3 gene ( previously know Cold Induced Autoinflammatory Syndrome-1 CIAS1 ) . These mutation result body 's overproduction interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , protein stimulate inflammatory process . IL-1 Trap ( rilonacept ) design bind interleukin-1 cytokine prevent bind receptor body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rilonacept Treatment Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes ( CAPS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : The primary objective study assess effect rilonacept clinical sign symptom Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome ( CAPS ) use chronic therapy evaluate subject time use validate patient-reported outcome tool . Secondary Objective ( ) : The secondary objective follow : - To determine safety tolerability rilonacept subject CAPS - To assess effect rilonacept laboratory measure inflammation acute phase reactant This multi-center , two-part , double-blind , placebo-controlled study ( Parts A B ) design assess efficacy , safety , tolerability weekly subcutaneous ( SC ) dose 160 mg rilonacept adult subject active CAPS . These phase follow extended open-label phase . After write informed consent obtain , subject meet protocol eligibility criterion enrol one 27 study site United States . The study consist 3-week screening period precede Part A , 6-week long double-blind , randomize phase study . All subject treat single-blind rilonacept 9-weeks , follow subsequent 9-week , double-blind , withdrawal phase subject re-randomized either rilonacept placebo . Subjects continue treatment 24-week open-label extension phase ( OLE ) 112-week long-term open-label extension ( LTOLE ) , subject receive rilonacept 6-week post-treatment follow-up period . Amendments 4 6 allow eligible adult pediatric subject age 7 enroll directly open-label phase trial . For report purpose , 24-week OLE 112-week LTOLE consider one Open Label Extension ( OLE ) phase . This occur 24-week double blind ( Parts A B ) phase . In word , OLE Week 1 correspond week 25 study . OLE Week 72 final timepoint efficacy measure . Safety continue timepoint end study .</detailed_description>
