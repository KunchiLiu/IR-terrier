	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine Angiotech central venous catheter ( CVC ) equal effectiveness CVC coat chlorhexidine silver sulfadiazine prevent bacterial catheter colonization . Other objective study determine Angiotech CVC equal effectiveness CVC coat chlorhexidine silver sulfadiazine prevent catheter-related local infection , catheter-related bloodstream infection . This study also assess safety Angiotech CVC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Angiotech Central Venous Catheter Prevent Bacterial Catheter Colonization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central venous catheter widely use hemodynamic monitoring administration fluid , drug , nutrition . The frequent life-threatening complication central venous catheter use septicemia . Normal cutaneous flora may invade intracutaneous tract catheter insertion . The colonize bacteria subsequently disseminate along catheter surface ultimately seed blood stream . In United States , total 250,000 case central venous catheter-related infection estimate annually . Costs per infection estimate high US $ 56,000 . It clinically imperative effective measure find decrease catheter infection rate minimize risk development microbial resistance . Primary Objective : The primary objective study determine non-inferiority Angiotech Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) compare ARROWgard Blue® CVC prevent bacterial catheter colonization . Secondary Objectives : The secondary objective study determine non-inferiority Angiotech CVC compare ARROWgard Blue® CVC prevent : 1. catheter-related local infection ; 2. catheter-related bloodstream infection . Safety Objectives : This study ass safety Angiotech CVC .</detailed_description>
