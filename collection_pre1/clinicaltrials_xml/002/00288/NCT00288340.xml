	<detailed_description>The goal project characterize abnormality brain structure function relate schizophrenia . We use advanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques measure degree distribution neuronal activity specific cognitive task , alteration neuronal connectivity , related disease symptom treatment . We focus change brain structure function associate frequent auditory hallucination , one disabling manifestation schizophrenia , neuroleptic treatment . In order address aim , study four group subject : 1. patient frequent auditory hallucination , 2. patient begin regimen anti-psychotic medication , 3. patient frequent hallucination change medication strategy , 4. age-matched normal control . Each group contain 15 subject total 60 .</detailed_description>
