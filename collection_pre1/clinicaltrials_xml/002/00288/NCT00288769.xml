	<brief_title>Oral Vitamin B12 Potential Treatment Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific Background : Recurrent painful canker sore within mouth ( Recurrent aphthous stomatitis , RAS ) common phenomenon Primary Medicine ( 1,2 ) . The term `` aphthai '' Greek mean condition within mouth attribute Hippocrates . ( 1 ) RAS characterize small , recurrent , painful canker sores mouth . These sore characteristic round elliptical ulceration sharp edge . The sore red halo surround base yellowish grey color ( 1,3 ) . Frequency phenomenon high 25 % general population recurrence problem 50 % ( 2 ) . RAS idiopathic case . A possible cause frequently local injury stress . Other possible cause include systemic illness , nutritional deficiency , sensitivity allergy certain food , illness effect immune system medication . Even though RAS associate celiac disease Behcet 's disease , case patient present problem complaint symptom patient consider healthy . Since cause condition unknown , Diagnosis base patient 's history physical examination . There laboratory test substantiate negate condition ( 4-7 ) . In medical literature different approach treatment describe : treatment various natural vitamin ( 8 ) , local ointment ( 9 ) , disinfectant agent local treatment ( 10 ) , local antibiotic ointment ( 11 ) , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ointment ( NSAID ) ( 12 ) , local cortisone-steroids ( 13 ) , even medication basis immune-depressants immune system systematic steroid ( 14-16 ) . Most approach try give temporary relief control pain heal sore ( 16 , 9-13 ) . In past report successfully treat three patient suffer RAS Vitamin B12 ( 17 ) . We also data regard treatment 15 RAS patient . ( This data yet publish . ) The frequency sores group average 1.5 episode per month treatment Vitamin B12 . During treatment frequency decrease 0.1 episode per month . As far know , research use double-blind design investigate Vitamin B12 treatment patient suffer RAS . Purpose research : To investigate effect Vitamin B12 frequency recurrent canker sores mouth ( RAS ) . Methods : A double-blind study daily administration sublingual Vitamin B12 tablet manufacture Solgar ( tablet contain 1000 mcg . Vitamin B12 , mannitol , stearic acid , Magnesium stearat , natural cherry flavor ; weight tablet 100 mcg . ) oppose placebo tablet ( contain ingredient , except Vitamin B12 ) . The two type tablet shape , size , color flavor . The tablet purchase Solgar Company identical box , 30 tablet per box . The box number ( 1 2 ) - accord type treatment . The patient receive instruction daily treatment period six ( 6 ) month , one tablet go sleep ) . Sample Size : In retrospective study do ( publish ) , find 73 % patient receive Vitamin B12 recurrent incident canker sores mouth . Assuming among patient receive Vitamin B12 treatment frequency disease least 90 % , study group expect 60 % patient continue suffer recurrent canker sore , order achieve confidence level 95 % power 80 % , need recruit 38 patient study group 38 patient placebo group . With assumption drop-out rate 30 % , need recruit 50 patient group . Patients : Candidates suffer RAS agree participate study sign inform consent form . Inclusion Criterion : - Over 18 year old . - Suffering RAS least one year frequency least one sore per month . Exclusion Criterion : - Known systemic disease concurrent lesion mouth ( Behcet 's disease , Rheumatoid arthritis ) . - Does speak Hebrew , Russian , English . - Patients receive last year Vit . B12 form . - Patients receive treatment RAS . - Pregnant nursing mother . - Patient know suffer Leber 's optic atrophy . - Patients suffer psychosis . Measurement treatment effectiveness : Principle measurement : - Number RAS occurrence treatment ( number episode per month ) . Secondary measurement : - Number sores per RAS occurrence . - Score severity level accord pain scale ( Visual analog scale , VAS ) , average time RAS occurrence . Measurement tool : - Occurrence diary - Pain Register Research Design : After receive permission Helsinki Committee begin process subject selection , register research study International Clinical Registration System ( /http : //prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov ) . Then recruit 20 primary physician volunteer ask 200 patient concern recurrent canker sores mouth . ( These patient come physician reason . ) Out 4000 patient accord literature , 800 patient suffer RAS . We expect half ( 400 patient ) report problem exist half agree participate research study . According estimate , 200 patient adhere inclusion/exclusion criterion . All patient ready participate study receive physician cell phone number Nose Throat Ear physician ( G.Z . ) physician ask patient contact G.Z . canker sore . In addition patient 's physician also give patient write health synopsis , include chronic disease , sensitivity medication medical treatment . The patient give synopsis one investigator ( ( IV , YP , RP , IR , ) meet . The patient contact G.Z . examine within 48 hour canker sore ( ) appear ascertain condition actually recurrent aphthous stomatitis . If patient actually suffer aphthous stomatitis , G.Z . hand patient 's information one investigator . One investigator contact patient make appointment next week . Meetings patient : One hundred ( 100 ) first patient find suffer aphthous stomatitis answer inclusion/exclusion criterion receive detailed explanation one languages , Hebrew , Russian , English purpose study , research design , risk involve research , possible side effect . Those patient sign informed consent form include study . At meet investigator fill form include socio-demographic data , detailed anamnesis concern RAS ( include number year patient suffer RAS , frequency problem past year , treatment patient receive RAS past ) . The physician also take measurement height , weight blood pressure . The subject also blood test measure level Vit . B12 . ( The sample undergo centrifuge within next hour serum keep frozen test do . ) Since retrospective study ( publish ) find difference result treatment people patient high low level Vit . B12 blood , level Vit . B12 include criterion inclusion exclusion study . The patient receive instruction concern fill `` Canker Sore Diary '' use VAS . The patient give appointment another month . They also receive cell phone number investigator order contact unexpected side effect occur . The subject include study divide randomly two group ( study group control group ) . Meetings Research Assistant 1 : After month time meet investigator , patient meet Research Assistant 1 ( physician ) , collect `` Canker Sore Diary '' give patient bottle 30 tablet active ingredient placebo , accord group belongs ( Control Study ) . The patient receive six ( 6 ) appointment ( every month ) . The whole series appointment decide advance . A day appointment Research Assistant 1 telephone patient remind appointment . During six meeting patient give Research Assistant 1 `` Canker Sore Diary '' , report new tablet begin take last month , Research Assistant count many tablet leave bottle list side effect , . At end meeting patient receive bottle tablet next month . In order check fact investigator know patient give treatment , investigator ask `` guess '' type treatment patient receive . Randomization : Randomization do Research Assistant 2 . Upon assign serial number subject , Research Assistant flip coin accord determine group subject belong . This number group record form . Assurance `` double blind '' design : In order investigator know group subject belongs , code randomization save computer protect user name password know Research Assistant 2 ( responsible randomization , one know box , No . 1 No . 2 , active ingredient , Vit . B12 . The code assign box investigator reveal data process . The research assistant take part data processing . Research Assistant 2 ( responsible randomization know code bottle ) meet subject know information subject . Statistical Analysis : The data enter process Research Assistant 3 Epi-Info-Data 6 . Statistical Analysis do investigator aide another research assistant ( statistician ) use SPSS . For statistical analysis t-test 2 use confidence level P &lt; 0.05 . References 1 .
