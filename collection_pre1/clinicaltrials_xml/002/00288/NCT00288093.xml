	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose 3-AP give together radiation therapy treat patient stage III pancreatic cancer remove surgery . 3-AP may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . 3-AP may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving 3-AP together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-AP Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximal tolerable dose ( MTD ) 3-AP administered combination radiation therapy ( XRT ) patient locally advance pancreatic carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To document therapeutic response combination patient locally advance pancreatic carcinoma . II . To establish radiographic correlate use secretin stimulate magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . III . To measure deoxycytidine triphosphate ( dCTP ) level peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) treatment specify time try correlate finding activity toxicity triapine . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study 3-AP ( Triapine® ) . Patients undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , approximately 5½ week ( total 28 fraction ) . Patients also receive 3-AP ( Triapine® ) IV 2 hour 3 day week every week 5½ week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos 3-AP ( Triapine® ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . At least 6 patient treated MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 1 year .</detailed_description>
