	<detailed_description>The study double-blinded crossover trial . We recruit 40 child age 12 18 year , pediatric renal hypertension program Texas Children 's Hospital . The study consist four phase , screen phase treatment phase , interim washout phase crossover phase . The screening phase last 1 2 week . Patients provide digital blood pressure monitor appropriately size cuff instruct perform daily blood pressure measurement keep blood pressure log . This detect severe hypertension need immediate attention identify patient family compliance problem likely compromise data collection . Blood test do determine eligibility base clinical laboratory parameter 10ml blood send research laboratory measurement erythropoetin , ADMA , MCP-1 possibly modulators vascular tone . Girls post-menarche urine serum pregnancy test . Prior initiation study procedure , inform consent child assent ( appropriate ) obtain participant parent . Immediately prior initiation treatment placebo phase 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM # 1 ) perform . Urinary nitrate protein creatinine ratio measure surrogate NOS activation ongoing renal damage . At end screen phase , eligible patient randomly assign either placebo allopurinol active phase . Children receive crossover phase . The purpose blinding remove either participant investigator bias acquisition data . Active Phase : The active phase last six week include clinic visit first day phase , laboratory test day 4 7 , telephone contact halfway phase . At clinic visit , patient receive study medication ( allopurinol placebo ) bottle prepared investigational pharmacy . Subjects allopurinol receive 10 mg/kg divide bid ( maximum 400mg ) . Laboratory test perform 4 7 day start medication screen hepatic bone marrow toxicity ( AST , ALT , CBC ) serum uric acid . Evidence toxicity cause un-blinding withdrawal study . The family also instruct continue daily blood pressure log start screen phase . Twenty-four-hour ABPM end phase laboratory test include , hemoglobin , serum uric acid , erythropoetin , ADMA , MCP-1 urinary nitrate perform conclusion active phase , prior discontinue study medication washout phase . Washout Phase : Upon completion ABPM end active phase , study medication discontinue . The family continue home BP log . The washout phase end either child meet criteria hypertension two week elapse since completion previous phase . Crossover Phase : The crossover phase identical procedure active phase except medication previously receive . Follow-up visit : Upon completion arm subject final clinic visit . The laboratory test repeat third ABPM complete initiate . Conventional antihypertensive therapy discuss initiated appropriate . Routine follow establish management child 's hypertension medical problem .</detailed_description>
