	<brief_title>The Diabetes TeleCare Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According recent 2002 estimate , yearly cost diabetes approximately $ 132 billion . The burden diabetes considerable , particularly ethnically diverse population . Disease management program focus self-management education effective improve metabolic control . Accordingly , American Diabetes Association clinical care guideline stress importance metabolic control prevent complication improve quality life person disease . Unfortunately , advance result widespread acceptance clinical practice . Therefore , propose translational research evaluate telemedicine technology use interactive video conferencing ( Diabetes TeleCare ) novel mean increase availability health professional rural community effective delivery diabetes self-management education program mean provide retinal screening primary care set . Our aim 1 ) develop implement 12-month intervention , Diabetes TeleCare improve adherence diabetes clinical care guideline improve diabetes control two community health center locate ethnically diverse , rural medically underserved community , 2 ) conduct one-year randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) 200 patient formally evaluate effectiveness Diabetes TeleCare compare Usual Care sample &gt; 60 % African-Americans , 3 ) determine cost-effectiveness satisfaction Diabetes TeleCare compare Usual Care . Participants recruit two community health center rural South Carolina randomize accord patient randomization schedule . Diabetes TeleCare ( structure curriculum ) deliver team consist register nurse/certified diabetes educator ( RN-CDE ) experience registered dietitian , support health professional link interactive video conferencing participant ( single group ) rural health center distant location . The primary outcome measure metabolic control ( A1c , lipid ) , blood pressure , use telemedicine-facilitated retinal screening capacity . Secondary outcome include satisfaction , quality life , health belief , knowledge . The economic analysis include assessment resource utilization , cost , health utility . In addition , incremental reduction cost per A1c estimate lifetime cost-utility Diabetes TeleCare compare usual care determine . Telemedicine may effective alternative traditional health care delivery system result improved diabetes education control .</detailed_description>
