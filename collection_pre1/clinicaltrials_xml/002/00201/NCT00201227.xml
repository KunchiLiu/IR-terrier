	<brief_title>Trial Enhance Adherence Multiple Guidelines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Because ongoing access majority U.S. population , primary care set great potential prevent manage cardiorespiratory illness . However , due broad focus compete demand , primary care practice often fail translate evidence-based guideline practice . Based 10 year practice-based observational intervention research , investigator develop multimethod assessment process ( MAP ) understand unique barrier , opportunity complexity diverse primary care practice setting . MAP use inform practice-individualized intervention result sustained increase evidence-based guideline clinical preventive service delivery . They integrate participatory quality improvement ( PQI ) process involve patient , office staff , physician MAP ( MAP/PQI ) enhance promote ongoing practice-specific quality improvement . The study response Request Applications `` Trials Assessing Innovative Strategies Improve Clinical Practice Through Guidelines Heart , Lung Blood Diseases '' . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study evaluate whether innovative MAP/PQI intervention increase adherence multiple cardiorespiratory guideline primary care practice . A group randomize clinical trial 60 primary care practice represent diverse patient population payment system conduct . After 2-year follow-up , control group cross-over refine delay intervention . MAP practice identify feature foster and/or impede adherence screen treatment guideline multiple cardiorespiratory disease among compete demand practice . PQI engage clinician , staff , patient implement tailored improvement target whole practice simultaneously focus change affect multiple guideline . Rates adherence multiple guideline compare intervention control practice . A comparative case study process analysis identify feature associate success . The major outcome adherence select group guideline address : hypertension ( chronic disease , ) asthma ( cyclic disease ) , diabetes ( chronic multiple co-morbidities ) , smoke ( simple screening ) cholesterol ( complicate ) . The conceptual framework well developed author significant prior work area . These insight incorporate refined intervention control group ( delay intervention ) , evaluate pre/post design . Tailoring MAP/PQI unique practice characteristic likely result sustain increase adherence cardiorespiratory guideline . The intervention translatable ongoing implementation evidence-based guideline primary care set majority Americans receive medical care .</detailed_description>
