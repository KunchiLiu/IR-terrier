	<brief_summary>Based astonish high response rate metastatic colorectal cancer weekly high dose 5-FU leucovorin , conduct clinical trial clarify activity regimen adjuvant set . The regimen 5-FU high dose leucovorin administer schedule INT-0089 chosen control arm proven effective standard 5-FU plus levamisole regimen short duration treatment.21 In study , continuous infusion 5-FU ( HDFL , Arm B ) bolus injection 5-FU ( Arm A ) administer high risk colon cancer ( N2 disease ) patient . The role TS level inhibition TS predictor adjuvant chemotherapy 5-FU base treatment clearly define prospectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Phase II Randomized Trial Postoperative Adjuvant Chemotherapy Patients With High Risk Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 75 % patient colon carcinoma present stage gross tumor surgically resect . Despite high resectability rate , 50 % colon adenocarcinoma patient die subsequent metastatic disease apparent surgery . These individual could benefit adjuvant local systemic chemotherapy . Based encouraging antitumor activity 5-FU plus leucovorin ( LV ) patient metastatic colon carcinoma6,7 , several investigator report result use combination adjuvant setting . Results NSABP C-038 suggest postoperative 5-FU plus leucovorin reduces risk colon cancer recurrence 30 % associate mortality 32 % compare MOF ( semustine , vincristine , 5-FU ) . Recently , investigator IMPACT group9 analyzed role adjuvant 5-FU plus high dose leucovorin give 5 day every 28 day total six course versus treatment patient stage II III colon cancer . The treatment arm show significant reduction ( 22 % ) mortality ( P=0.029 ) 35 % reduction relapse rate ( P=0.0001 ) . Preliminary result study also suggest benefit 5-FU plus leucovorin adjuvant treatment colon cancer10,11,12 . Those study employ chemotherapy 5-FU plus leucovorin , although difference duration treatment drug dose among trial , strike reveal similar magnitude benefit adjuvant chemotherapy 5-FU leucovorin node positive patient . At present time , 5-FU plus levamisole 5-FU plus leucovorin consider acceptable adjuvant chemotherapy regimens patient node positive disease . Thymidylate synthase ( TS ) critical therapeutic target fluoropyrimidine cytotoxic drug mainstay treatment patient advance colorectal cancer . TS provide sole de nono source thymidylate DNA synthesis . The clinical importance TS determine fluoropyrimidine cytotoxicity establish clinical preclinical study . Increased expression TS protein due underlie gene amplification describe cell line select drug resistance exposure 5-FU.22,23 Several investigator also demonstrate intratumoral TS activity predictive response 5-FU.24-26 High TS activity associate response , whereas low TS activity associate good response 5-FU .</detailed_description>
