	<brief_title>Gemcitabine/ Trastuzumab Gemcitabine/ Cisplatin/ Trastuzumab Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Previous study demonstrate anti-tumor efficacy gemcitabine trastuzumab metastatic breast cancer give alone combination . Yet , research indicate two drug give together work effectively either alone . Laboratory study test combination trastuzumab cisplatin show synergistic anti-tumor activity two drug . In addition , clinical study suggest high level anti-tumor activity combination gemcitabine cisplatin . Researchers test triple drug combination gemcitabine , trastuzumab , cisplatin current study evaluate potential enhance responsiveness patient Her-2/neu overexpressing breast cancer well compare double drug combination gemcitabine trastuzumab . Purpose : This study measure patient response compare efficacy double drug combination ( gemcitabine trastuzumab ) triple drug combination ( gemcitabine , trastuzumab , cisplatin ) patient metastatic breast cancer . Side effect carefully assess patient . Treatment : Patients study receive one two treatment combination . A computer randomly assign patient treatment group . Group one give gemcitabine trastuzumab . Gemcitabine give patient day 1 8 , trastuzumab day 1 , 8 , 15 . Group two receive gemcitabine , trastuzumab , cisplatin . Gemcitabine cisplatin administer day 1 8 , trastuzumab day 1 , 8 , 15 . Each treatment cycle ( group ) last total 21 day . All study drug administer intravenous infusion . Several test exams give throughout study closely monitor patient . Thorough patient exam give begin treatment cycle . Imaging test do every two cycle first eight cycle every three cycle study completion . Study treatment discontinue due disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria : Must invasive metastatic breast cancer Tumor must Her 2/neu 3+ IHC ( must confirm Ohio State University pathology ) positive FISH Histological confirmation invasive breast cancer either original diagnosis and/or diagnosis metastatic disease . Tumor must detectable clinically radiographically ( positive bone scan allow site disease ) . Unidimensional measurement must obtain whenever possible ) . Bone marrow disease eligible enrollment study . No evidence congestive heart failure , symptom coronary artery disease , serious cardiac arrhythmia , evidence prior myocardial infarction EKG ECHO . Patients must normal LV function LVEF ( leave ventricular ejection fraction ) &gt; 50 % demonstrate either echo muga within proceed 4 week . Must adequate renal hepatic function document serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) , serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN liver enzyme ( AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase ) &lt; 2 x ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN hepatic metastasis ) within 21 day prior registration . Patients must ANC ( absolute neutrophil count ) &gt; 1.5 , platelet &gt; 100,000 , Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 within 21 day registration . If patient bisphosphonates time registration , stable creatinine precede 2 month , may continue bisphosphonates study . No one prior Trastuzumab/chemotherapy Trastuzumab/biotherapy combination metastatic disease . Additional Trastuzumab therapy may give adjuvant set . Prior hormonal therapy allow either adjuvant metastatic disease . Must &gt; 3 week since administration last chemotherapy prior initiation treatment trial . Prior trastuzumab may administer within one week initiation treatment trial last dose 2 mg/kg . Any prior trastuzumab dose great 2 mg/kg require 3 week washout period . Patients may receive prior cisplatin carboplatin metastatic disease . No CNS ( central nervous system ) metastasis disease . No active infection time registration . Pregnant nursing woman may participate trial . Patients must inform investigational nature study sign give write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status &lt; 2 time registration . Patients may participate nontreatment relate protocol participate study . No active malignancy allow . Adequately treat basal cell , squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient diseasefree 5 year allow .</criteria>
