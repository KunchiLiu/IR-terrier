	<brief_title>Etanercept Gemcitabine Patients With Advanced , Chemotherapy Naive Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The standard treatment pancreatic cancer gemcitabine . This study combine gemcitabine etanercept , drug bind tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) molecules block activity inhibit interaction cell surface TNF receptor . TNF name protein body often help fight foreign substance . However , research suggest pancreatic tumor develop resistance TNF use support cancer growth . Combining etanercept , TNF inhibitor , gemcitabine novel approach advance pancreatic cancer . Because etanercept test combination gemcitabine , Phase I study conduct first identify safe dosage etanercept , Phase II study evaluate efficacy combination . Purpose : This study evaluate safety etanercept gemcitabine advance pancreatic cancer Phase I , efficacy etanercept gemcitabine condition Phase II . TNF inflammatory marker also measure study . Treatment : Patients study receive gemcitabine etanercept . Gemcitabine administer intravenous infusion weekly seven week follow one week rest . Additional treatment gemcitabine give three week follow one week rest . Patients administer etanercept small injection underneath skin twice week . Six patient initially enrol Phase I . If severe side effect appear least two patient Phase I , additional patient enrol treated low dosage gemcitabine . When treatment produce unacceptable side effect , Phase I portion study end Phase II begin enrol patient . Patients Phase II portion study also receive gemcitabine etanercept safe dosage identify Phase I . Several test exams give throughout portion study closely monitor patient . Treatments discontinue due disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
