	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension prevalent chronic condition , leave untreated , lead significant cardiovascular morbidity premature mortality . There establish , evidence-based guideline treatment hypertension . However , guideline routinely adhered provider reason well know understood . In addition , inadequate control BP nationwide well document . This study explore barrier guideline adherence ( Phase I ) evaluate , via randomize controlled trial , new approach enhance guideline adherence ultimately BP control . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The long-range goal principal investigator develop evaluate collaborative relationship physician pharmacist improve pharmacotherapy . This 5-year , multicenter study evaluate impact physician/pharmacist collaborative team adherence hypertension guideline ( JNC-VI ) six community-based family practice site . There two study phase . Phase I comprise needs assessment identify barrier guideline adherence design intervention implementation refinement strategy . Phase II prospective , randomized trial assess impact physician/pharmacist collaborative team hypertension guideline adherence BP control . The specific aim Phase I ( 1 ) identify scope nature physician patient variable may contribute poor guideline adherence ( 2 ) refine intervention implementation strategy design tool assess guideline adherence barrier adherence . The specific aim Phase II ( 1 ) determine change guideline adherence knowledge hypertension physician involve physician/pharmacist team 2 ) determine physician/pharmacist team achieve good BP control compare usual care . The investigator expect improvement guideline adherence reduction BP intervention significantly impact patient hypertension . Because 37 million Americans uncontrolled hypertension , model potential become important strategy help achieve BP goal Healthy People 2010 .</detailed_description>
