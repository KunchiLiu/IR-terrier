	<brief_summary>Choline find increase concentration breast cancer patient . Hypothesis : The choline signal observe MRS sensitive treatment , positive response treatment give reduction choline concentration . The purpose study establish method quantification choline breast cancer MRS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Choline Quantification Breast Cancer MRS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Establishment new MRS sequence choline quantification choline . This sequence choline-selective , signal water lipid suppress simultaneously . 2 . Compare different method choline quantification . The first method quantification external phantom standard , contain know concentration choline . The method base utilisation internal water signal reference . Both calculation perform MR exam . Ten patient include study .</detailed_description>
