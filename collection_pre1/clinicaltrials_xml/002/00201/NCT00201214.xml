	<brief_title>Citrulline Children Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Increased pulmonary vascular tone ( PVT ) complicate postoperative course follow six surgical procedure congenital heart defect : 1 ) unrestrictive ventricular septal defect ( VSD ) repair ; 2 ) atrioventricular septal ( AVSD ) repair ; 3 ) arterial switch procedure transposition great artery ( TGA ) ; 4 ) Norwood I procedure ; 5 ) bidirectional Glenn shunt procedure ; 6 ) Fontan procedure single ventricle lesion . PVT partially control nitric oxide ( NO ) . Arginine , precursor NO , product urea cycle . Preliminary data present regard 169 infant child undergo one six previous surgical procedure . It find urea cycle function plasma arginine level significantly decrease patient . Furthermore , patient increase PVT significantly low arginine level compare patient normal PVT . Finally , genetic single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rate limit urea cycle enzyme ( carbamyl phosphate synthetase I [ CPSl T1405N ] ) appear affect postoperative plasma arginine level PVT . The hypothesis genetic polymorphism rate limit urea cycle enzyme CPSl , important enzyme urea cycle , influence availability NO precursor . It hypothesize perioperative enhancement urea cycle function key urea cycle intermediate ( citrulline ) increase plasma arginine NO metabolite , prevent elevation PVT . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This phase I/II study determine pharmacokinetics safety three dose intravenous citrulline give child undergo cardiopulmonary bypass correction congenital heart defect .</detailed_description>
