	<detailed_description>- Trial objective : The primary objective determine proportion patient 50 % decrease PSA maintain least 4 week , advance hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) patient receive thalidomide ( 100 mg BID ) . Secondary objective include objective tumor response rate measurable lesion , median duration tumor response , median time disease progression assessments clinical benefit , quality life , safety profile . - Number patient : 70 evaluable patient .Simon 's optimal two-stage design use allow early termination sufficient evidence non-effectiveness collect . Thalidomide consider non-effective proportion PSA response 14 % low , worthy study proportion response 30 % high . Controlling risk accept thalidomide non-effective 5 % risk reject thalidomide effective 10 % , design call 26 patient first stage . If four less PSA response observe , study terminate . Otherwise , additional 44 patient enter second stage . The treatment reject total 14 less PSA response observe 70 patient . This design 70 % chance termination first stage true PSA response rate 14 % low . With 70 patient , study provide 95 % assurance claim difference estimate true proportion within 11 % . - Medication Dose : Thalidomide ( THADO 50mg/cap . ) 100mg , BID . - Duration : Continue treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity patient meet off-study criterion . - Efficacy assessment : % patient 50 % decrease PSA maintain least 4 week , Objective tumor response Median duration tumor response Median time disease progression , Clinical benefit pain , performance status , weight - Quality life ( evaluated instrument EORTC-QLQ-C30 , FACT-prostate ) Safety assessment : - Toxicity -Adverse Event -Laboratory Test</detailed_description>
