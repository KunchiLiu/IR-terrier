	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL Double bedtime dose immediate-release morphine administration cancer patient : A randomized , double-blind cross-over comparison double bedtime dose versus two standard dos bedtime night Introduction Oral morphine recommend World Health Organization pain control moderate strong cancer pain 1 . At hospital use practice recommend Expert Working Group European Association Palliative Care introduction strong opioids titration immediate-release ( IR ) morphine dose every 4 hour optimal balance analgesia side effect achieve . After optimal daily dose define slow-release ( SR ) morphine total daily morphine dose start 2 . One feature EPAC guideline patient treatment IR morphine give double bed-time replaces next 4-hourly dose night 2 . The rationale behind recommendation give double dose prolong duration morphine analgesia eliminate need awake patient night . However , recommendation base expert opinion evidence clinical study 2 . Todd et al . recently present result challenge approach cross-over study patient receive either double bedtime dose regular dos every 4-hour 3 . This study show patient receive double bedtime dose report pain , use rescue medication report inferior sleep quality compare patient receive regularly schedule dos . A limitation study perform study blind thus consequently result subject bias . It need placebo-controlled study evidence carry enough weight change current recommendation . Besides clinical study also relevant obtain pharmacokinetic observation double bedtime regularly IR morphine dosing . Repeated blood sample disturb patient night hence confound clinical observation ( e.g . sleep quality ) . Consequently , blood sample obtain dose interval clinical data obtain .</detailed_description>
