	<brief_title>Liposomal Doxorubicin , Vincristine , &amp; Dexamethasone Plus Arsenic Trioxide Untreated Symptomatic Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The chemotherapy combination doxorubicin , vincristine dexamethasone ( DVd ) use efficacy patient multiple myeloma . However , DVd 's efficacy primarily consider palliative patient condition . The current study add arsenic trioxide DVd combo ass treatment together improve patient outcome . Previous study suggest arsenic trioxide may enhance efficacy specific chemotherapy agent include DVd ; however , research people yet demonstrate improved effectiveness . Because safety arsenic trioxide test patient population , phase II study gather information safety also measure efficacy various measure . Purpose : This study evaluate safety efficacy doxorubicin , vincristine dexamethasone plus arsenic trioxide untreated patient symptomatic multiple myeloma . The biology tumor molecular change also assess patient collection blood marrow sample . Treatment : Patients study receive arsenic trioxide , doxorubicin , vincristine dexamethasone . During first five day study , patient give arsenic trioxide day intravenous infusion . No treatment provide day six seven . After first week , patient receive study drug follow schedule every four week : doxorubicin vincristine day one , dexamethasone day one four , arsenic trioxide twice week . This schedule repeat four time total approximately four month . Several test exams give throughout study closely monitor patient . Supportive care provide help regulate side effect study drug maintain quality life patient . Treatments discontinue due disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
