	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial GM-CSF Patients With ALI/ARDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Respiratory failure due ALI/ARDS remain major health problem , despite significant progress intensive care unit care ventilator management . ALI/ARDS characterize unacceptably high mortality despite enormous expenditure health care resource . Survivors face long-term consequence may affect quality life . New therapy need improve early survival decrease long-term sequelae syndrome . GM-CSF naturally occur cytokine present normal lung , important role pulmonary homeostasis . GM-CSF essential normal maturation function alveolar macrophage ( resident inflammatory cell responsible initial defense pneumonia ) . Alveolar epithelial cell line gas exchange surface lung . Acute lung injury subsequent abnormal healing link delay repair damage epithelium follow initial injury . This lead pulmonary fibrosis . GM-CSF potent effect alveolar epithelial cell , promote proliferation limit epithelial cell death . Thus , GM-CSF distinctive combination activity make excellent candidate therapeutic intervention ALI/ARDS . Preliminary study project demonstrate GM-CSF protect experimental animal acute lung injury , decrease susceptibility pneumonia , protective pulmonary fibrosis follow acute lung injury . There extensive experience administration recombinant human GM-CSF human patient ( biological approve FDA well-tolerated trial involve critically ill patient ) . This project base hypothesis administration GM-CSF improve clinical outcome patient ALI/ARDS . DESIGN NARRATIVE : With assent attend physician , informed consent obtain patient next kin soon possible case identification . Physiologic measurement specimen collection begin time entry study . Three day patient meet criterion ALI/ARDS entry study ( whichever later ) , he/she randomize receive recombinant human GM-CSF ( 250 mcg/M2 ) placebo , administer slow intravenous infusion daily 14 day . This study allow entry patient fulfil criterion ALI/ARDS 7 day . Treatment initiated patient meet criterion least 3 day . Treatment GM-CSF may prove safe effective within first 1-2 day lung injury . However , present study address question . It unlikely opportunity improve outcome lose delay therapy 3 day ( base propose mechanism GM-CSF might benefit patient population ) . Similarly , decision treat 14 day allow improved outcome patient non-resolving ARDS reduce incidence ventilator-associated pneumonia decrease pathologic fibroproliferation . The primary endpoint study duration mechanical ventilation . Additional important endpoint include change severity physiologic derangement respiratory gas exchange , non-respiratory organ failure , incidence ventilator-associated pneumonia . Additional assessment design determine mechanism benefit GM-CSF treatment include measure lung epithelial cell integrity measure alveolar macrophage ( lung inflammatory cell ) function .</detailed_description>
