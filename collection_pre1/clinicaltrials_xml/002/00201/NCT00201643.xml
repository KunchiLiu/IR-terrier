	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Comparing Impact One Versus Two Courses Antenatal Steroids ( ACS ) Neonatal Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial . The objective study evaluate impact one versus two course antenatal steroid incidence major neonatal morbidity include respiratory distress syndrome patient deliver prior 34 week ' gestation randomize prospective fashion . Preterm delivery occur approximately 10 % delivery United States . Preterm birth cause 75 % neonatal mortality mention significantly increase morbidity respiratory distress syndrome , intraventricular hemorrhage , necrotizing enterocolitis , sepsis . Numerous study evaluate safety efficacy antenatal corticosteroid ( ACS ) administration threaten preterm labor . National Institutes Health ( NIH ) first consensus conference 1994 evaluate research field . Conclusions include clear evidence antenatal corticosteroid decrease incidence RDS infant born 29-34 week gestation , decrease RDS severity infant bear 24-28 week gestation decrease incidence intraventricular hemorrhage infant bear 24-28 week gestation without harm mother fetus . Their recommendation give single course corticosteroid pregnant woman 24 34 week gestation risk preterm delivery within 7 day . Since study duration effect antenatal corticosteroid fetus conclusive , many obstetrician repeat corticosteroid weekly bi-weekly patient continue risk preterm delivery . Lacking scientific evidence , many investigator perform retrospective analysis regard effect single-course versus multiple-course antenatal corticosteroid . The NIH consensus panel reconvene 2000 conclude study regard repeat course corticosteroid suggestive possible benefit , especially reduction RDS , however , design flaw limit validity . The recent publication Caughey Parer examine literature evidence regard dose response benefit detriment antenatal corticosteroid . Based complex mathematical analysis recommend fetus ' 24 34 week ' gestation risk preterm delivery give first course ANC . If risk preterm delivery persist next course give 2 week later , maximum two course . Consistent previous article , call well design randomize , control trial made .</detailed_description>
