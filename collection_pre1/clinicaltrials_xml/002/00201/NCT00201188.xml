	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma chronic , potentially life-threatening disease affect 17 million people United States . Asthma lead million lose work day thousand hospitalization annually . For million people disease , chronic controllable . Corticosteroids effective medication long-term treatment persistent asthma , inhale medication minimize potential systemic side effect . Despite convince evidence benefit inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , patient doctor seem reluctant use regularly . Many people prescribe ICS either never take , take less frequently ( e.g. , rather twice daily ) , less regularly ( e.g. , `` need '' rather daily ) , low dos prescribe . Doctors agree least 50 % people prescribed ICS fail benefit fully poor adherence . The many reason non-adherence fully understood . The relationship doctor patient , area potential impact make , believe strong predictor medication adherence . Providing pertinent information asthma relate lung function prompt communication patient doctor improve adherence ICS . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The overall purpose study improve anti-inflammatory medication adherence asthma outcomes encouraging communication patient doctor . The specific aim study include follow : 1 ) improve adherence ICS medication encourage patient-doctor communication feedback objective information airflow obstruction reinforce medication-taking behavior ; 2 ) document impact encouragement communication health care outcome , include health care utilization , pulmonary function , need rescue course oral steroid , functional impact . The hypothesis study inform patient primary care doctor degree airflow obstruction prompt interaction result great adherence ICS medication one year occur control group similar patient receive feedback . Promoting communication adult asthma doctor primary care clinical setting yet study . All doctor within three general medicine practice adult patient moderate severe asthma enrol assign either intervention usual care . Feedback interpret peak flow graph relation current medication therapy prompt communication . The intent encourage support relationship doctor patient rather directly intervene . The power encourage communication lie ensue dialogue doctor patient . Improvement adherence ICS among people moderate severe asthma show decrease morbidity asthma improve health outcome .</detailed_description>
