	<brief_title>Etanercept Rituximab Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Previous research demonstrate rituximab efficacy chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) . Rituximab monoclonal antibody use treat different type lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody type immunotherapy use type cancer . They produce laboratory design target well bind cell carry specific protein . Rituximab attach protein call CD20 find almost exclusively surface B-cells . Once rituximab attache protein , immune system activates kill malignant B-cells . Researchers investigate therapy combine rituximab reduce side effect improve patient outcome . The current study combine etanercept rituximab . Etanercept anti-inflammatory agent test therapy cancer . Researchers want ass theory etanercept may reduce toxicity associate rituximab patient increase efficacy provide treatment benefit patient . Purpose : This study evaluate safety efficacy combination etanercept rituximab patient CLL SLL . The biological response tumor cell immune system drug combination also measure patient , , therapy administration . Treatment : Patients study receive etanercept rituximab . Etanercept give injection skin rituximab intravenous infusion . During first week study , etanercept alone give patient two time . During second week , patient continue receive etanercept twice weekly begin receive rituximab three time weekly . This schedule etanercept twice weekly rituximab three time weekly repeat four time . Several test exams give throughout study closely monitor patient . Treatments discontinue due disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
