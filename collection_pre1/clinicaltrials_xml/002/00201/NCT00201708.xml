	<brief_title>Dose-Dense Docetaxel Before After Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide Axillary Node-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Studies suggest chemotherapy agent docetaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide efficacy different type breast cancer . However , optimal sequence administer treatment remain unknown . The current study ass two separate sequence docetaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide . Purpose : This study evaluate two different combination chemotherapy schedule patient axillary node-positive breast cancer . Combination one docetaxel doxorubicin cyclophosphamide . Combination two docetaxel doxorubicin cyclophosphamide . The combination dose reduction docetaxel within 10 week test Phase III study . The toxicity docetaxel also assess study participant . Treatment : Patients study receive one two chemotherapy combination schedule . A computer randomly assign patient treatment group . Group one receive docetaxel doxorubicin cyclophosphamide . Group two receive docetaxel doxorubicin cyclophosphamide . Patients group one receive docetaxel every two week total eight week . These patient give combination doxorubicin cyclophosphamide every two week total eight week . Patients group two receive combination doxorubicin cyclophosphamide every two week total eight week . These patient give docetaxel every two week total eight week . Several test exams give throughout study closely monitor patient . Treatments discontinue due disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
