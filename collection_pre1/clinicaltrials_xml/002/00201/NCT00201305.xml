	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Plus High-Dose 5-Fu/Leucovorin Treatment Advanced Metastatic Carcinoma Biliary Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>5-FU mainstay chemotherapeutic agent gastrointestinal malignancy . The use weekly 24-hour infusion HDFL produce high clinical response variety cancer , include colorectal , gastric breast cancer , minimal chemotherapy-related toxicity . Gemcitabine synthesize deoxycytidine analogue metabolize dFdCTP tumor cell result inhibition DNA synthesis depletion normal cellular nucleotide pool . It show active treatment pancreatic cancer non-small cell lung cancer . Since biliary tract pancreas share common embryonic origin cancer sit characterized resistance chemotherapeutic agent , postulate gemcitabine may also effective cancer biliary tract . In institution devise regimen weekly gemcitabine 24-hour infusion HDFL patient advance metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . In 18 evaluable patient , 2 achieve partial response 3 minor response . The median duration response 4 month treatment-related toxicity acceptable . The eligibility criterion patient advance metastatic carcinoma biliary tract candidate curative surgical treatment ; good performance status ; prior chemotherapy ; clinical measurable tumor ; good organ function good compliance . Each cycle chemotherapy consist 4 week . On day 1 , 8 15 , gemcitabine give 30-minute intravenous infusion 5-FU leucovorin 24-hour continuous intravenous infusion . The dose gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 . The dos 5-FU 2000 mg/m2 leucovorin , 300 mg/m2 . Treatment continue disease progress prohibitive toxicity develop . For patient complete response ( CR ) , chemotherapy continue 3 additional course documentation CR . Estimated time patient accrual 3 year .</detailed_description>
