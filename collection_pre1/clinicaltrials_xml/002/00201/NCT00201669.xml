	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Clofarabine Patients With Aggressive Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Two Food Drug Administration drug approve blood cancer non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) include fludarabine ( Fludara ) cladribine ( Leustat ) . The drug offer current study , clofarabine design combine anti-cancer strength fludarabine cladribine . Laboratory research suggest clofarabine target anti-cancer mechanism cell , help repair DNA , inhibit tumor growth . Research also indicate clofarabine efficacy variety blood cancer solid tumor . Numerous tumor response observe high dos clofarabine heavily pretreated patient different type lymphoma . The current study build previous research test clofarabine patient aggressive NHL . Purpose : This study evaluate safety efficacy clofarabine aggressive NHL . Toxicities result combination clofarabine supportive care drug GM-CSF also analyze patient . GM-CSF blood-forming agent stimulates production white blood cell . In addition , several test , include blood tumor tissue analysis , assess immune response biological change tumor result study drug . Treatment : Patients study give clofarabine intravenous infusion . This drug initially provide patient five consecutive day . Several test conduct supportive care agent administer stabilize patient ' blood cell count , immune response , reduce risk infection . The first ten patient study hospitalized recovery first five day clofarabine carefully monitor additional toxicity result dose regimen . Patients receive another five day treatment cycle clofarabine within seven day recover previous cycle four week start previous cycle . Disease response measure every two cycle treatment clofarabine . Patient stable reduced disease receive maximum six treatment cycle clofarabine . Treatments discontinue due disease growth , unacceptable side effect , treatment delay 21 day .</detailed_description>
