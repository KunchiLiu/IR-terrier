	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The recent dramatic rise prevalence obesity heighten awareness significant impact overweight , physical inactivity , unhealthy eat pattern development chronic disease disability While little doubt obesity associate lifestyle factor ( e.g. , sedentary lifestyle ) constitute serious threat health , also clear lifestyle intervention produce body weight reduction sufficient magnitude improve health . The exist research limit , however , respect two important factor , specifically , generalizability underserved population , maintenance treatment effect . Most weight-loss trial consist efficacy study conduct middle-class participant deliver `` optimal '' ( i.e. , academic research ) venues rather `` real world '' ( i.e. , community ) setting . Furthermore , exist literature show , absence long-term care , regain lose weight routinely follow conclusion treatment . Recent research show improved maintenance lose weight lifestyle intervention supplement clinic-based follow-up program . Thus , next logical step line research ( ) extend study community setting underserved population ( b ) test promise alternative potentially efficient mode treatment delivery , follow-up care via telephone-based contact rather via in-person clinic visit . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized control clinical trial examine impact two maintenance intervention design sustain weight lose lifestyle treatment obesity .

Participants stratify accord county BMI , randomly assign group 11-12 one two experimental program comparison condition . The experimental maintenance program design help participant sustain eat physical activity pattern need maintain lose weight . The primary difference two maintenance program mode delivery . One delivered via office-based group counsel format ; deliver via telephone counseling .
