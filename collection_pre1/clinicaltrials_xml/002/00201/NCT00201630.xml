	<brief_title>Prophylactic Vs . Therapeutic Use Uroxatrol Men Undergoing Brachytherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate brachytherapy increasingly popular method treat clinically localize prostate cancer . The major morbidity procedure obstructive irritative voiding symptom . The risk urinary retention publish series 10-15 % . Voiding symptom persist 1 year follow procedure . The primary experience treat obstructive irritative voiding symptom men benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) . In patient moderate severe void symptomatology , base American Urological Association ( AUA ) Symptom Score Index , medical treatment alpha antagonists become commonplace . The use alpha antagonist base upon reduction smooth muscle tone prostate gland urinary bladder neck inhibition alpha1 adrenoceptor , result relaxation bladder outlet obstruction increase urinary flow . Alfuzosin hydrochloride approve FDA treatment sign symptom BPH 2003 . Alfuzosin differs  1-adrenergic receptor blocker absence piperidine moiety presence diaminopropyl spacer , confers alfuzosin specific biochemical property . Affinity study human-cloned  1 receptor subtypes show alfuzosin , like terazosin doxazosin , devoid significant receptor subtype selectivity . In isolated human tissue , however , alfuzosin display high selectivity ratio prostate vascular tissue ( ratio , 544 ) compare tamsulosin ( 90 ) , doxazosin ( 51 ) , terazosin ( 19 ) . Prostate cancer common malignancy men . One common treatment prostate cancer prostate brachytherapy , radioactive seed implantation . All patient affect obstructive irritative voiding symptom various degree follow procedure due edema inflammation induce trauma radiation . Many physician routinely treat obstructive irritative voiding symptom follow prostate brachytherapy alpha-blocker . Patients present clinically localize prostate cancer may elect permanent prostate brachytherapy definitive therapy . The efficacy therapy match radical prostatectomy external beam radiation . Many patient select brachytherapy since single treatment session consider minor surgery . Most patient discharge day may resume normal physical activity without restriction almost immediately . However , trauma needle stick perineum couple effect radiation cause prostatitis symptom similar irritable bladder benign prostatic hypertrophy . These symptom considerable impact quality life patient many medicate alpha-blocker . Several study attempt define best predict treat symptom . However , incidence severity symptom difficult predict . The prophylactic use alpha-blocker may better control symptom men undergo prostate brachytherapy . The aim study compare outcome urinary morbidity follow prostate brachytherapy patient treat alfuzosin prior implantation patient treat follow implantation .</detailed_description>
