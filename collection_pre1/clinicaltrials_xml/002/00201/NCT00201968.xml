	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether aerobic resistance training program functional electrical stimulation-assisted Walking program effective reduce health complication relate spinal cord injury , example , occurrence bladder infection , pressure sore and/or frequency spasm . It hypothesize functional electrical stimulation-assisted walking great impact secondary complication aerobic resistance training program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Electrical Stimulation-Assisted Walking : Reduction Secondary Complications Due Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A barrier maintain health status active social participation community individual spinal cord injury ( SCI ) broad number secondary medical complication typically associated injury , bone loss , spasticity , urinary tract infection pressure sore . Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) intervention applies short current pulse muscle cause contract . FES applied individual SCI help restore function walk grasp contract group paralyze muscle orchestrate manner . Pilot work conduct research group suggest apply FES augment functional improvement often reduce incident secondary complication spasticity , pressure sore , swell leg . Specifically , functional meaningful walking task perform regular basis help FES therapy potential improve overall physical psychological well person incomplete SCI . This study seek demonstrate thrice-weekly FES train 4 month restore/improve walk function chronic , incomplete SCI individual therapy considerably reduce occurrence secondary complication due SCI . This subsequently promote opportunity active social participation enhance quality life SCI consumer . Comparison : 32 individual chronic , incomplete SCI randomize either thrice-weekly FES therapy OR thrice-weekly aerobic resistance training . The study determine therapy superior improve walk function reduce secondary complication associate SCI 4 month training , 2-month 8-month follow-up period .</detailed_description>
