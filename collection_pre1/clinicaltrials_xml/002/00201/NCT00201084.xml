	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A large amount literature suggest majority `` uncontrolled '' hypertensives medical care , lack control largely explain physician intensify treatment achieve BP target recommend national guideline . Traditional physician education , feedback , reminder limit effect promote rapid rate guideline implementation . The theoretical framework diffusion innovation suggest provide physician tool reduce uncertainty attribute guideline may accelerate adoption process . The presumed barrier treatment intensification uncontrolled hypertension : 1 ) uncertainty patient 's `` true '' BP ; 2 ) uncertainty whether patient adherent medication already prescribe ; 3 ) uncertainty benefit add medication patient express preference lifestyle modification . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This cluster randomize trial 10 primary care clinic ( 5 intervention 5 control ) test hypothesis intervention base diffusion innovation theory , target provider treatment action , increase prevalence BP control Joint National Committee-7 ( JNC-7 ) recommend level African American patient ( great 140/90 mm Hg great 130/80 mm Hg patient diabetes ) . The uncertainty reduction tool `` Uncertainty Reduction Accelerate Diffusion ( URAD ) '' practice include : 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring , electronic bottle-cap monitoring medication adherence , medication lifestyle counseling . The `` Usual Practice ( UP ) '' physician receive education guideline `` placebo '' chart form indicate patient follow BP control study . The 10 participate clinic represent large , multi-site private group practice public health care system . Sixty-seven patient per clinic ( 670 total ) enrol intervention initiate , BP self-reported medication lifestyle adherence monitor two year . Sixty percent sample African American , study 90 % power detect difference 20 % prevalence hypertension control African Americans result intervention ( 50 % control URAD clinic vs. 30 % control UP clinic ) . Secondary endpoint include BP measurement study staff standardize condition , physician treatment intensification action , patient adherence , characteristic doctor-patient communication associate treatment action , use URAD component , physician knowledge belief JNC 7 guideline relationship BP control . Analysis secondary endpoint include race . The research team collaborate health system previous study , experience conduct hypertension control behavioral intervention study target population .</detailed_description>
