	<brief_title>Post-Operative Adjuvant Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy For High Risk Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potentially resectable Stage III IV squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( HNSCC ) treat operation adjuvant radiotherapy . The 5-year survival rate approximate 30 % . Recurrence typically occur within 3 year , 60-80 % locoregional site , 20-30 % systemically . Patients find tumor margin surgical specimen far particularly poorly . Chemotherapy add hope improve situation . Induction adjuvant chemotherapy result decrease appearance systemic metastasis trial , improve locoregional control survival . For case unresectable head neck cancer , concurrent chemoradiotherapy appear improved locoregional control , disease-free survival , possibly overall survival , compare radiotherapy alone . Bachaud et al . report randomized trial postoperative cisplatin radiotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone patient Stage III IV head neck cancer . Cisplatin administer 50 mg weekly radiotherapy . There significant improvement locoregional control ( 70 % vs. 55 % ) well overall survival ( median 36m vs. 20m ) patient receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy . Al-Sarraf et al . also report phase II concurrent chemoradiotherapy trial , use cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every three week . Based comparison similar patient treat prior RTOG trial , conclude postoperative radiotherapy concurrent cisplatin may improve locoregional control rates10 . The superiority adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) RT alone sequential adjuvant RT chemotherapy confirm analysis data RTOG 85-03 RTOG 88-24 . Comparing high-risk patient RTOG 85-03 prognostically similar patient RTOG 88-24 , data suggest sequential surgery , RT , chemotherapy produce good locoregional control surgery plus RT , surgery follow CCRT produce even high locoregional control . Independent differences amount RT deliver , Cox proportional hazard model suggest addition CCRT result 50 % decrease locoregional relapse rate compare surgery plus postoperative RT chemotherapy . The reduction mortality 18 % . Although CCRT may better RT alone sequential treatment , 3 year survival adjuvant CCRT study around 50 % . Is aggressive treatment warrant ? Tolerance CCRT major concern . In French study , severe acute toxicity occur 18 % RT patient 41 % patient receive CCRT . In RTOG 88-24 trial , severe life-threatening toxicity occur 20 % 12 % patient , respectively ; common drug-related toxicity leukopenia , anemia , nausea , vomit . Theoretically , optimize CCRT , continuous presence chemotherapeutic drug drug effect necessary maximize effect radiosensitization . For radiosensitization purpose , daily chemotherapy may better weekly weekly may better tri-weekly . French study use weekly cisplatin dose 30 mg/m2 . RTOG 88-24 use different treatment dose schedule 100 mg/m2 cisplatin radiotherapy day 1 , 23 43 . We choose weekly convenience hope increase recruitment patient . In pilot study , observe remarkable toxicity treatment schedule . Considering remarkable toxicity report preliminary experience , drug , high dosage , extend schedule may justify .</detailed_description>
