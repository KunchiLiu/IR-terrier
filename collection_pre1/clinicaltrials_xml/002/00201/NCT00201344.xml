	<brief_title>A Phase III Study Radiotherapy With Without Adjuvant C/T Advanced Stage Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The head neck contract study test induction maintenance chemotherapy patient advanced head neck cancers.There significant difference survival two group , disease free survival prolong maintenance arm induction arm . Time frequency distant metastasis first site relapse significantly well maintenance arm . Many trial , design several year ago , deliver single agent chemotherapy particularly intensive . Most clinical trial deal heterogenous group head neck cancer patient . We felt well choice adjuvant chemotherapy cancer include : ( 1 ) localize cancer high metastatic potential follow effective local treatment ; ( 2 ) effective chemotherapy available ; ( 3 ) chemotherapy intensive effective enough avoid development drug resistance . Of course , NPC long regard one suitable head neck cancer may benefit adjuvant chemotherapy due unique high response rate chemotherapy high metastatic potential radiotherapy localize , advance staged disease . If radiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy improve treatment result standard radiotherapy increase survival rate , decrease metastatic rate local recurrence rate , many NPC patient may benefit . Therefore , propose phase III study radiotherapy without adjuvant PFL chemotherapy advance stage NPC patient .</detailed_description>
