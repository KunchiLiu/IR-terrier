	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Although original interest condense atypicals , fact hospital discourage use atypical antipsychotic new onset schizophrenia policy reason direct u study design look type therapeutic . Coincidently , design may provide hint unresolved research issue mention . The propose study bridge important information gap , provide data contribute towards well understand risk management diabetes associate use type antipsychotic . As researcher field describe diabetic related condition broader term call `` metabolic X-syndrome '' , risky condition lead cardiovascular disease diabetes , insulin resistance major outcome , associate two follow condition : truncal obesity ( deposit thorax abdomen , instead hip thigh ) , high triglyceride , high LDL cholesterol hypertension,3 therefore extend study diabetes metabolic X-syndrome phenotype genetic study . This proposal aim study : 1. prevalence diabetes/metabolic X-syndrome associate use antipsychotic Taiwanese Han Chinese population ; 2. clinical sociodemographic correlation diabetes/metabolic X-syndrome associate use antipsychotic ; 3. putative role gene development treatment emergent diabetes/metabolic X-syndrome secondary administration antipsychotic . Background Affecting approximately 1 % population worldwide , schizophrenia represent major cause morbidity dysfunction afflict loved one , well significant burden health care system society general . Although antipsychotic often remarkably effective ameliorate schizophrenic symptom enhance social functioning , use often limited propensity cause serious side effect could compromise patient ' health condition . One side effect diabetes . Research publication 1919 , long advent psychotropic medication , show schizophrenia might predispose individual diabetes.1 Following introduction chlorpromazine , first antipsychotic modern era , large number case report antipsychotics-induced diabetes report . This complication seem serious new type antipsychotic , generally regarded atypical antipsychotic due lack extrapyramidal reaction see schizophrenic treat antipsychotic discover previously . Several retrospective study base health service claim database , strongly suggest psychiatric patient expose atypical antipsychotic may high risk develop diabetes . In addition , patient treat medication also appear high risk develop ketoacidosis . Risk factor include ethnicity ( African Americans , Asians , Hispanics Native Americans ) , family history diabetes overweight obesity . The association atypical antipsychotic onset diabetes strengthen observation : 1. time sequence initiation antipsychotic treatment onset diabetes ; 2. remission discontinuation medication ; 3. re-emergence diabetes follow re-introduction atypical antipsychotic . Together , data indicate treatment emergent diabetes , along metabolic disturbance ( e.g. , dyslipidemia obesity ) , represent serious issue use atypical antipsychotic . This notwithstanding , many question crucial clinical theoretical interest remain un-clarified . Major current debate unresolved research issue include : ( 1 ) schizophrenia per se , versus use antipsychotic , trigger diabetes ; ( 2 ) whether difference `` typicals '' `` atypicals '' effect ; ( 3 ) whether difference among different `` atypicals ; '' ( 4 ) whether , extent , treatment emergent diabetes may associate , independent , weight gain , also often associate use antipsychotic ; ( 5 ) genetic environmental risk association treatment emergent diabetes . This application aim address important issue , well establish platform future study may comprehensive in-depth nature . In contrast plethora case report report base secondary data analysis , dearth information derive study might useful provide definitive answer question . Our review extant literature lead two study worth note regard : 1 . A five-year longitudinal study conduct Henderson et al Boston , report patient treat clozapine experience significant weight gain lipid abnormality appear increase risk develop diabetes.2 Overall , 36.6 % ( 30/82 ) patient develop newly diagnose diabetes 5-year period . 2 . In sizeable cross-sectional study conduct northern Sweden , prevalence diabetes patient receive clozapine approximately 12 % versus 6 % controls.3 It note study focus clozapine , neither provide information specifically population Oriental Asian background . Obesity overweight know risk factor insulin resistance , could eventually lead development type 2 diabetes . Since atypicals ( well schizophrenia ) likely induce significant weight gain , reasonable speculate diabetes associate atypicals might secondary weight change . However , number reason suggest factor addition to/or weight gain may also important : ( 1 ) diabetes also occur patient gain weight ; 2 ( 2 ) many case , improvement diabetes occur within 2 week , fast effect reversal weight change ; ( 3 ) relatively high rate ketoacidosis , well rapidity recovery follow discontinuation treatment , suggest putative diabetogenic effect atypicals might secondary inhibition insulin secretion , rather insulin resistance . Very little known mechanism typical antipsychotic obesity overweight , however , share pathway type antipsychotic , specific pathway use typicals atypicals . The possible role insulin secretion mediate atypicals ' diabetogenic effect support abundance serotonin receptor pancreatic beta cell . In addition mechanism involve production function insulin , factor affect pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics atypicals might also significantly determine whether individual and/or population would less likely develop diabetes , well severity unintended effect . Putting consideration together , propose multi-factorial work model , emphasize central role function pancreatic beta cell , also include factor mediate insulin resistance , well control metabolism atypicals , effect central nervous system . Such model concurrently consider genetic factor might determine effect atypicals factor alter glucose homeostasis target tissue , well interaction among factor . Previous achievement Dr. Loh engage study psychiatric genetics since 1993 . These study mainly emphasize genetic susceptibility alcoholism illicit drug abuse . The research extend thesis work international collaboration still conduct use family case control design . Methods Subject Recruitments : Research subject recruit three collaborative site : Taipei City Hospital Songde Branch , Mackay Memorial Hospital Yu-Li Hospital . The Institutional Review Boards National Health Research Institutes , Yu-Li Hospital Mackay Memorial Hospital approve study , permit Institutional Review Board Taipei City Hospital Songde Branch still apply . Inpatients outpatient diagnose schizophrenia accord DSM-IV criterion , treat either typical atypical antipsychotic , either male female , age 18 65 year old , eligible study . Exclusion criterion include : 1 . Illegal drug use/abuse/dependence ; 2. alcoholism ; 3. pregnancy ; 4. clinical diagnosis type I type II diabetes onset schizophrenia treatment schizophrenia ( via chart review ) . According empirical experience , around 150 new onset schizophrenic may collect year three collaborative site . For chronic schizophrenic , clinician must aware eligible patient suitably group statistic ( e.g. , poor responder typical psychotic ) . Eligible subject invite participate study , sign write informed consent . Possible Impediments : The patient may complain many biochemical measurement conduct study period . We reduce total number biochemical measurement 3~4 time year research subject complain . We lose information data able reveal trend biochemical change . Clinical Laboratory Procedures - Clinical Assessments New case Clinical information subject come treatment schizophrenia first time collect use follow assessment tool Chinese version : ( I ) Clinical Global Severity ( Clinical Global Impressions - Severity ) Positive Negative Symptom Scale ( PANNS ) : CGI Severity PANNS use clinician record severity schizophrenic illness time assessment . The score range CGI 1 ( normal , ill ) 7 ( among extremely ill patient ) . One scale choose access psychiatric condition patient . ( II ) Diabetes Risk Assessment : The Diabetes Risk Assessment ( ADA , 2000 ) 7-item self-report scale design determine presence know risk factor development Type 2 diabetes . Each item assign point value point total achieve overall risk rating . ( III ) Life Style Survey : The Life Style Survey self-report scale specifically design study ascertain certain aspect daily health habit study participant . Behaviors related smoking , alcohol use , substance use , diet , exercise , family history evaluate . The CGI , ADA assessment tool Chinese version translate validated Dr. Tsuo-Hung Lan , use clinical study metabolic X-syndrome ( YLH93001 B20030902 ) . -- -Data collection Old case : While new case provide information interested , patient treat schizophrenia previously well document record warrant retrospective study . Although psychiatric physical condition may consist variable interested , nevertheless point direction study new case . In brief , psychiatric physical information old case assess chart review value variable ( e.g. , Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [ BPRS ] , triglyceride level , glucose level , etc . ) DNA collect use pharmacogenetic study . If possible , variable necessity describe collect follow simplified guideline derive current protocol . - Physical Assessments : Weight , height , hip waist circumference blood pressure , collect standard method . -- -Biochemistry : The following biochemical value measure fast state every two month , 6 time : glucose , insulin , leptin , lipid panel ( Total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol triglyceride ) glycohemoglobin ( HBA1C A1C ) . For exploratory purpose , data process examined two way . First , adopt diagnostic guideline suggest The Expert Committee On The Diagnosis And Classification Of Diabetes Mellitus , The American Diabetes Association,5 define classify subject ' glucose metabolism status . However , criterion change time time interested see biochemical value may form new index , second option manipulate variable plan . We use measurement HbA1C additional index diabetes . The Expert Committee On The Diagnosis And Classification Of Diabetes Mellitus include HbA1C one criterion diabetes difficulty standardize reference range measurement across laboratory . This much less concern study since procedure perform laboratory , result use research rather clinical purpose . The addition HbA1C afford u information glycemic level time scale week , whereas plasma glucose varies greatly within give day day day . Thus , elevate HbA1C indicate chronic state hyperglycemia hyperglycemia measure FPG 2-h PG may transitory . - Pharmacogenetics : Current suggestion include candidate gene involve pancreatic beta cell insulin secretion ( e.g. , HNF-1a , HNF-4a ) , insulin action ( e.g. , calpain 10 , TNFα ) , serotonin/dopamine function ( e.g. , 5-HT2A , 2C , D2 , COMT ) pharmacokinetic ( e.g. , CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , ) pathway . SNPs population frequency 0.1~0.15 concerned priority . -- -Data Analysis : Clinical Data : The primary outcome diagnosis diabetes base American Diabetes Association criterion . Estimates insulin secretion ( fast glucose/insulin ratio ) insulin sensitivity well demographic variable evidence over-weight/obesity evaluate risk factor development diabetes . Pharmacogenetic Data : The approach analysis case-control association study : SNPs within gene combine form haplotype provide informative genotype . Association study haplotypes do first , compare diabetic non-diabetic group . Modeling contribution multiple gene also conduct . When SNPs associate antipsychotic induced diabetes identify , interactive effect analyze multiple logistic regression . -- -Sample Size Power Considerations : Based current available data CATIE ( Clinical Antipsychotic Trials Intervention Effectiveness ) conduct U.S.A , 9.5 % incidence rate diabetes schizophrenic treat atypical antipsychotic predict . In addition , Hagg report 12 % incidence rate confirm type II diabetes among patient treat clozapine cross sectional study.4 We use Genetic Power Calculator6 estimate sample size need . We define power 0.8 , type I error rate 0.05 , simple common acceptable parameter , i.e. , ( 1 ) risk ratio susceptible homozygous genotype set 3 , ( 2 ) risk ratio heterozygous genotype set 1.5 , ( 3 ) prevalence phenotypes interest set 10 % . When SNPs allele frequency 0.15 used condition , approximately 135 case 270 control need reach desired power . Expectedly , obtain 135 subject atypical antipsychotics-induced diabetes , need examine 1350 new schizophrenic patient treat antipsychotic . Such expectation implies pharmacogenetic study atypical antipsychotics-induced diabetes feasible , however , reality , prevalence hyperglycemia ( one components X-syndrome ) among patient treat antipsychotic may higher 10 % Han Chinese population . In addition , susceptible genotype may higher risk ratio . Thus , posterior power estimation may give even high power conservative estimation even small sample size . Moreover , sample merge sample medical center . Thus , task examine 1350 schizophrenic patient treat antipsychotic , feasible . -- -A Sample Preliminary Pharmacogenetic Studies : We plan examine collection DNAs 292 sample Tao-Yuan Psychiatric Hospital 393 sample Yu-Li hospital . The sample evaluate clinical procedure physical measurement describe . However , leptin measure HbA1C evaluate . Furthermore , rest biochemistry measure twice 1st month 6th month . Nevertheless , sample collection worth explore preliminary study . Anticipated Results Discussions Years 1 2 : Collect clinical information , biochemical data DNA sample , carry preliminary statistical analysis examine 292 393 sample Tao-Yuan Psychiatric Hospital Yu-Li hospital , respectively . Years 3 , 4 5 : Form composite index preliminary statistical analysis , continue collect DNAs conduct pharmacogenetic study use DNA sample collect study . A good understanding nature correlate diabetic complication crucial field 's ongoing effort improve care welfare schizophrenic patient . In addition , diabetes X-syndrome associated antipsychotic and/or schizophrenia also may represent unique opportunity understand pathogenesis management diabetes general . It also could potentially particularly effective model study gene-environment interaction crucial understanding common human disease . Ultimately , goal develop genetic test predict therapeutic response . As , view national health economy , study may prove personalized medicine save money . This study provide opportunity researcher train extend statistical skill estimate putative role gene therapeutic response . In addition , understand HbA1C , interest debatable laboratory diagnostic test diabetes , gain . References 1 . Kohen D. Diabetes mellitus schizophrenia : historical perspective .
