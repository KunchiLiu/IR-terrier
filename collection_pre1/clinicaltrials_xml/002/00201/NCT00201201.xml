	<brief_title>Reducing Adverse Self-Medication Behaviors Older Adults With Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Failure old adult take medication properly estimate factor quarter emergency room visit 10 percent nursing home admission , total cost $ 25 billion annually . It estimate 10 percent adverse drug event may attribute communication failure provider patient . Lack adherence prescription medication protocol adverse self-medication practice result drug interaction fatal . In health environment promotes polypharmacy old adult , group less well able see , hear , understand medical information general population , need exists educate old adult provider danger adverse drug interaction arise self-medication . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The goal reduce adverse self-medication practice old adult hypertension . A computer program develop old adult ( Personal Education Program PEP ) modify next generation PEP , ( PEP-NG ) , include interface allow client enter self-medication behavior data independently wireless , touch screen tablet computer . Data enter PEP-NG analyzed via secure server ( ProHealth ) program content tailor specific adverse self-medication behavior deliver . Summaries report behavior corrective strategy print patient provider advance practice register nurse ( APRN ) good idea client 's self-medication practice begin face-to-face interview . Thus , PEP-NG make optimal use client 's waiting time APRN 's clinical time . Specific aim three level . 1 ) To design interface PEP-NG : ) desirable characteristic older adult primary care provider ; b ) minimal user burden . 2 ) To show APRNs increase : ) knowledge concern potential drug interaction arise old adult ' self-medication practice ; b ) self-efficacy teach old adult potential drug interaction ; c ) self-efficacy communicate old adult self-medication ; ) demonstrate satisfaction use PEP-NG client . 3 ) To show old adult use PEP-NG : ) increase knowledge concern potential drug interaction arise self-medication practice ; b ) increase self-efficacy avoid potential drug interaction arise self-medication practice ; c ) reduce self-reported adverse behavior associate potential drug interaction ; 4 ) improve prescription medication adherence ; ) achieve target blood pressure reading ; demonstrate e ) satisfaction PEP-NG f ) APRN provider relationship . User-sensitive inclusive design method use develop test patient data interface . After beta-testing PEP-NG primary care laboratory , PEP-NG pilot 10 APRNs affiliate ProHealth primary care practice . Repeated Measures Analysis Variance ( RM ANOVA ) one within subject factor ( TIME ) perform APRNs ' outcome measure time 0 , immediate post-instruction , 3 6 month later . APRNs recruit 24 client ( 240 total ) meeting study criterion . The PEP-NG software randomly assign APRN 's client either control ( data collection ) experimental ( data collection plus educational intervention target message ) . Client outcome assess 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 52 week analyze mixed ANOVA NURSE GROUP between-subjects factor TIME repeated-measures factor . Healthcare utilization compare 2 group 52 week cost-benefit analysis conduct .</detailed_description>
