	<brief_title>Efficacy Bone-anchored Hearing Aid Unilateral Deafness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Limited study do BAHA adult single side ( sensorineural ) deafness , study evaluate short-term efficacy one month post implantation . The finding limit number study date BAHA single side deafness demonstrate BAHA improve understanding noisy group situation understand conversation address speaker side bad ear user judge BAHA least satisfactory benefit . But conflict finding obtain regard whether BAHA improve ability locate source sound . Additionally , study do see whether magnitude improvement see one month post implantation increase time learn effect brain plasticity . This investigation show whether previously report BAHA benefit one month post BAHA sound processor fitting , relate speech recognition noise subjective satisfaction , persist one year , whether learn effect increase magnitudes benefit one month one year post BAHA sound processor fitting . This long-term investigation also attempt resolve conflict finding pertain BAHA effect localization ability . Subjects hear impairment comprise 20 adult single side deafness consent remediation BAHA.In order see adults unilateral hearing loss differ normal-hearing subject time , control group 20 normal-hearing individual also evaluate time , see closely result unilateral deafness group approximate result normal individual .</detailed_description>
