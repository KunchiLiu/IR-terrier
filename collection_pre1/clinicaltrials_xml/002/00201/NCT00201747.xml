	<brief_title>Sequentially Administered CPT-11 Mitomycin C Patients With Advanced Esophageal Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Previous study suggest irinotecan Mytomycin C administer alone efficacy stomach cancer . Based laboratory test , researcher hypothesize Mytomycin C may enhance efficacy irinotecan enzyme call Topoisomerase I . In addition , Mytomycin C severe side effect , combine chemotherapy agent together may allow low dosage result great efficacy reduce side effect . A recent study indicate combination drug promise anti-tumor activity esophageal stomach cancer . The current study build previous research explore effective schedule administer drug together . Purpose : This study evaluate combination irinotecan Mytomycin C two different treatment schedule patient advance esophageal stomach cancer . Characteristics different gene also measure , along genetic molecular change compare test result begin end study . Treatment : Patients study receive irinotecan Mytomycin C one two treatment schedule . Both drug administer patient intravenous infusion . A computer randomly assign patient treatment group . Group one receive Mytomycin C day 1 irinotecan day 2 9 . Group two receive Mytomycin C day 1 8 irinotecan day 2 9 . After day 9 , patient group give study drug almost three week complete four week cycle . Several test exams give throughout study closely monitor patient . Patients continue receive study drug experience disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
