	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation accept therapy AML . Transplants unmodified HLA-matched relate bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell follow condition total body irradiation ( TBI ) cyclophosphamide VP-16 busulfan cyclophosphamide lead sustained DFS rate 45-60 % adult transplant first complete remission ( CR1 ) 40-53 % patient transplanted second complete remission ( CR2 ) . In several single center multicenter cooperative group prospective trial compare HLA-matched allogeneic transplant chemotherapy treatment AML CR1 , DFS rate transplant arm almost invariably superior ; however , advantage statistically significant minority cooperative group study conduct . In study , risk relapse significantly low patient receive allogeneic transplant . However , advantage counterbalance transplant-related mortality , principally reflect infection complicate GVHD treatment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Despite increase risk infection , development effective T cell depletion ( TCD ) techniques prevention GVHD tolerable modification regimens pre-transplant cytoreduction secure consistent engraftment offer potential significant decrease transplant-related mortality . Furthermore , use TCD transplant treatment patient AML associate substantial increase incidence relapse . Several single center trial indicate highly encouraging long-term result , particularly patient AML CR1 CR2 . Although number case single center series limit , consistency result suggest use effective technique TCD together adequate cytoreductive regimen might yield transplant result superior achieve unmodified graft .</detailed_description>
