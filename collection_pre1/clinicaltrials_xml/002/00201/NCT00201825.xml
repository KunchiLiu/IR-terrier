	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Capecitabine Docetaxel Previously Untreated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Docetaxel efficacy non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . This drug Food Drug Administration approve combination cisplatin ( Platinol ) treatment unresectable , locally advanced metastatic NSCLC patient previously chemotherapy condition . Docetaxel also approve second line treatment metastatic NSCLC . Research indicate capecitabine , combination docetaxel , efficacy NSCLC . Capecitabine appear anti-cancer activity several enzymes . This drug metabolize body another agent call 5-FU . During conversion process , 5-FU require thymidine phosphorylase ( TP ) , cellular characteristic associate tumor growth . There high level TP expression tumor compare normal tissue . The drug administration schedule study design optimize efficacy TP target docetaxel capecitabine . This study measure biological change TP enzymes help researcher gain information capecitabine docetaxel work NSCLC . Purpose : This study evaluate efficacy docetaxel capecitabine patient previously untreated advanced NSCLC . Tests related tumor biology conduct study treatment correlate patient response therapy . Treatment : Patients study receive docetaxel capecitabine . Docetaxel administer intravenous infusion . Capecitabine provide oral pill . A four-week period constitute one cycle . Docetaxel give weekly three week follow one week rest . Capecitabine take twice daily day 5 14 treatment cycle . Several test exams give throughout study closely monitor patient . Treatments discontinue due disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
