	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hypertension affect 25 % adult United States remain lead cause heart disease , stroke , kidney failure . Despite numerous effective treatment , 25 % people hypertension goal blood pressure ( BP ) . The chronic care model suggest BP control achieve improving patient self-care system care deliver . Patient self-care effort direct counteract effect obesity , physical inactivity , poor dietary pattern , non-adherence prescribed medication BP . In addition , effort direct use quality improvement system counteract well-documented non-adherence primary care MDs establish clinical practice guideline . In addition improve BP control , approach also reduce cost associate hypertension consequence . However , give resource would require implement approach , critical effectiveness rigorously establish . This control study test separate combine effect behavioral intervention patient CQI intervention MDs BP control . The patient intervention employ proven behavioral method promote healthy lifestyle adherence medication regimen . The MD intervention use CQI approach provide training , motivation , feedback performance non-threatening way promote continuous self-improvement adherence clinical practice guideline . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Hypertension Improvement Project ( HIP ) randomize , control study test separate combine effect CQI intervention MDs behavioral intervention patient BP control . MDs select practice Duke Primary Care Research Consortium serve low-income minority population . Practices randomly assign MD intervention MD control condition . Within practice , MDs receive intervention patient individually randomize patient intervention patient usual care condition . The MD intervention consist follow three main element : 1 ) on-line training module ; 2 ) evaluation treatment algorithm use clinic ; 3 ) CQI procedure involve assessment clinical performance measure feedback MDs adherence guideline . The performance data collect 18 month feedback provide MDs every 3 month . Patients practice ( approximately 50 % woman , least 40 % African American , 90 % low-income ) randomly assign patient intervention usual care . The patient intervention consist 6-month behavioral intervention aim lifestyle change low BP promote adherence prescribe BP medication . BP follow-up measurement perform end intervention year later ( 6 18 month post-randomization ) . The primary outcome proportion patient treatment group adequate BP control 6 month . BP control define Joint National Committee 6 ( JNC-6 ) goal ( systolic BP le 140 mm Hg diastolic BP le 90 mm Hg patient ; low goal patient cardiovascular renal disease , diabetes ) . Other outcome study include BP control 18 month , MD adherence national guideline , patient adherence lifestyle recommendation medication regimen . A cost analysis also do . The study enroll 500 patient 10 practice ( approximately 20 MDs ) , 80 % power detect effect size 0.3 primary outcome . The HIP study test practical intervention improve hypertension control broadly implement reduce CVD risk .</detailed_description>
