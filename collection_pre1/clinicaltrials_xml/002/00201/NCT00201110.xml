	<brief_title>Problem Solving Cardiovascular Disease Risk Management Diabetic Blacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : African Americans type 2 diabetes carry high burden CVD risk adverse vascular event stroke peripheral vascular disease . CVD risk factor suboptimal blood pressure , lipid , glycemic control controllable medical management lifestyle behavior modification . The traditional primary care medical management model chronic CVD risk inadequate , model shift toward increase disease-related decision-making self-management part patient . Yet , precise method : 1 ) identifying patient ineffective disease-related problem-solving skill , 2 ) provide patient disease-related education incorporate problem-solving decision-making skill , yet determine DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study test measurement tool novel training intervention problem solve apply self-management high CVD risk African Americans type 2 diabetes . The specific aim : 1 ) ass validity reliability empirically derive assessment tool effective versus ineffective CVD risk-related problem-solving ability ( Health Problem Solving Scale , HPSS ) , 2 ) develop novel intervention teach CVD risk-related problem-solving skill ineffective problem solver , 3 ) conduct pilot study sample African Americans type 2 diabetes high CVD risk profile ( suboptimal blood pressure , lipid , and/or HbA1c ) AND ineffective CVD risk-related problem-solving skill , measure HPSS . The principal investigator recipient Research Scientist Development Award . Her career goal become independent researcher self-management CVD risk high-risk African American population , leader development translation practice novel , theory-driven empirically base intervention improve patient self-management CVD risk .</detailed_description>
