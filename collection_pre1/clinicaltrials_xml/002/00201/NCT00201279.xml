	<brief_title>Chemoprevention Study Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There one thousand death annually head neck cancer Taiwan ( exclude nasopharyngeal carcinoma ) majority treatment failure relate recurrence primary disease . Only patient early-stage disease high cure rate , remain risk development second primary tumor . Second primary malignancy occur constant annual rate 5 % 7 % head neck cancer patients1 . Furthermore , mortality primary disease recurrence plateaus 2 3 year patient locally advanced disease , second primary tumor become major cause late cancer mortality . Sporn et al define chemoprevention effort arrest reverse premalignant cell progression invasive malignancy2,3 . The concept chemoprevention evolve include use specific compound , rather general dietary change , prevent development cancer . Hong et al studied effect 13-cis retinoic acid patient history head neck cancer 4 . After treatment head neck primary cancer either radiotherapy surgery , 103 patient randomize receive either adjuvant 13-cis retinoic acid placebo . In update trial 55 month follow-up , 16 patient ( 31 % ) placebo group develop second primary tumor , whereas 7 patient ( 14 % ) treatment group develop second primary tumor ( p=0.04 ) 5 . Betel quid chew becomes increasingly popular Taiwan . Exposure smoke betel quid significantly increase risk oral cavity cancer6 . The hazard develop second primary tumor high population , therefore , chemoprevention worthy trial . Use 13-cis RA chemoprevention head neck cancer publish Hong et al . Their case include variety head neck cancer know homogenous group . The risk second primary different different primary site . Therefore , value 13-cis RA chemoprevention conclusively address . In proposal , oral cavity cancer include result convincing . The result could basis chemoprevention clinical trial guideline clinical practice .</detailed_description>
