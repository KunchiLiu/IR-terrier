	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo control , phase II-III trial conduct assess safety efficacy live attenuate Towne CMV vaccine seronegative woman child daycare . Only one dosage one route administration use . The primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy Towne vaccine prevent CMV infection seronegative woman child daycare . The secondary objective define antibody response CMV , specifically neutralize , avidity , isotype response , antigen specificity , cellular response marker protection infection viremia . The primary study endpoint percentage people develop evidence primary CMV infection . Each participant , provide consent , screen evidence previous CMV infection ( CMV antibody ) . Seronegative participant randomize 1:1 receive single immunization either CMV vaccine ( SC ) one dose Havrix ( hepatitis A vaccine , IM ) , act control . A second Havrix dose offer termination study . All subject offer dose Havrix expose hepatitis A . Although seronegative woman enrol , woman tell serologic status . An explanation give action . Participants receive CMV vaccine receive 6000 PFU participant receive hepatitis A vaccine receive standard license dose 1440 EL.U . adult enrollment offer another dose 1440 EL.U . end study participation . Participants study personnel unaware route administration blind whether participant receive vaccine placebo . A total 180 woman age 18 45 enrol . Subjects discontinue prematurely replace . The duration individual 's participation enrollment 36 month less . In order determine subject 's household exposure CMV , family member ask provide urine saliva CMV culture every 3 month 3 year . Seronegative father sexual partner provide serum every 3 6 month determine infection rate among male spouse partner since may source maternal infection . Safety data include local systemic reactogenicity dose vaccine collect systematic format . For 30 minute vaccine administration subject continuous observation study nurse local systemic assessment . Subjects monitor vaccine associate illness follow : ( 1 ) subject maintain temperature chart two week follow vaccination . ( 2 ) subject contact research nurse every three day two week follow vaccination . If local pain , swell , delay hypersensitivity reaction develop , symptom inspect research nurse measure degree duration swell . In addition , nurse determine degree severity local reaction scale 1 - 4 , 1 mild 4 severe . ( 3 ) At time follow-up visit , write interval history obtain participant regard acute illness , hospitalization , drug medication , change medical history problem . Urine , saliva , collect every 2 month 12 month serum collect 1,2,4,6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 36 month vaccination . All child bear vaccinee test congenital CMV infection determine reactivate vaccine virus transmit transplacentally . The investigator use PCR analysis DNAs viral isolates .</detailed_description>
