	<brief_title>Soy Lipoproteins Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain leading cause mortality disability postmenopausal woman . Menopause alters serum lipid lipoprotein produce atherogenic lipid profile may contribute significantly increase risk development CVD lifetime woman . Clinical trial demonstrate beneficial effect soy protein contain isoflavones ( soy ) plasma lipid lipoproteins ; however , study include small number postmenopausal woman virtually none include sufficient African-American woman . In addition , publish data exist 2001 impact soy atherogenic lipoprotein subclasses postmenopausal woman . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study double blind , parallel group , randomize clinical trial . A total 160 healthy postmenopausal woman ( 50 percent African-American ) LDL cholesterol 130 mg/dL 190 mg/dL enrol . Following pre-randomization run-in period NCEP Step I diet , woman randomize receive soy contain isoflavones casein dietary supplement 3 month . Major outcome variable assess group baseline 3 month . It hypothesize soy supplementation would result significantly great reduction LDL cholesterol , LDL particle concentration , prevalence dense LDL particles improvement menopausal quality life compare placebo effect would comparable African-Americans white . This first study determine whether natural plant product could ameliorate unfavorable change know novel lipid risk factor consequence menopause African-American white woman . The unique transitional outcome explore study add substantially limited body knowledge effect soy . Evaluation nutritional alternative hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) may provide beneficial effect lipid risk factor menopausal symptom would free adverse effect triglyceride , breast uterus , thrombotic event associate HRT could significant public health implication postmenopausal woman .</detailed_description>
