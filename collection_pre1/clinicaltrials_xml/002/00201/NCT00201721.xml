	<brief_summary>This study aim assess rate complete overall response use rituximab pentostatin without cyclophosphamide , monitor assess toxicity regimen , determine overall progression-free survival CLL patient</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pentostatin , Rituximab With Without Cyclophosphamide Previously Untreated B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Research indicate cyclophosphamide pentostatin work synergistically cancer cell high response rate chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) without create severe side effect patient . In addition , study show rituximab , therapy target immune system , high efficacy CLL low toxicity rate compare immunotherapy drug . Studies also show rituximab enhances efficacy chemotherapy agent cyclophosphamide pentostatin . This study offer combination immunotherapy two promising chemotherapy agent CLL . Purpose : This study evaluate efficacy safety combination treatment cyclophosphamide , pentostatin , rituximab patient CLL . Several test evaluate genetic molecular component CLL also perform . Some test conduct , , treatment ass change result study drug . Each patient 's outcome assess relation various aspect gene .</detailed_description>
