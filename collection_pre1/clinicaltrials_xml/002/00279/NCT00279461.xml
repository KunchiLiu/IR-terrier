	<brief_summary>Recent study demonstrate subject low blood level vitamin D high risk develop autoimmune disease Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) . We pursue study test hypothesis restoration vitamin D level ameliorate manifestation RA . We test hypothesis inviting patient RA participate trial examines effect oral vitamin D administration clinical expression disease . For purpose , participant trial ask take oral dose 2,000 unit vitamin D daily 6 month . We examine participant 's joint , assess disease activity measure , determine his/her blood level vitamin D start treatment periodically thereafter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Deficiency Causes Immune Dysfunction Enables Perpetuates Development Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Low vitamin D level hinders ability macrophage produce activate 1-25Dihydroxyvitamin site inflammation . 1-25Dihydroxyvitamin D important immunoregulatory function include down-regulation antigen-presenting cell dendritic cell . Under influence 1-25Dihydroxyvitamin D , dendritic cell become tolerogenic ─ oppose immunogenic ─ abrogate immune response early stage . Immunogenic dendritic cell play key role development autoimmune disease Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) `` present '' self-antigens immune system . Vitamin D level frequently low patient RA . Restoring vitamin D availability normal level patient RA may induce improvement disease manifestation expansion tolerogenic dendritic cell subset . Key Objectives : - Conduct double-blind randomized clinical trial , test hypothesis vitamin D administer patient active RA beneficial effect disease . - Determine vitamin D administer patient RA . induces expansion tolerogenic dendritic cell subset analyze pattern cell surface marker expression dendritic cell different time point clinical trial ( translational study ) . Study Population : We recruit early RA patient ( 12 month duration disease ) active joint inflammation care institution.Participants must subject active RA time inclusion , 18 year age old history autoimmune disorder disorder cancer osteoporosis also link vitamin D deficiency . The eligible patient active RA treatment RA Methotrexate time inclusion . Patients take anti-cytokine treatment ( consider standard ) would exclude . Other exclusion include hypercalcemia , history renal failure renal stone . 20-25 participant allocate Vitamin D Group , Arm A . 20-25 participant allocate Placebo Group Arm B Allocation conduct randomize , double-blind fashion . Summary Procedures : After sign write consent , potential candidate undergo screen interview PI screen blood test ( blood sample 20 ml require ) . RA subject qualify receive study treatment randomize receive oral vitamin D 2,000 unit placebo daily 6 month . Patients examine monthly basis drawn 20 ml blood sample every 2 month monitoring purpose period 12 month . The participant within clinical trial also participate translational study dendritic cell , draw additional blood sample 40 ml first month end study isolate blood dendritic cell . We study expression different activation marker dendritic cell consent participant use various immunologic technique . This allow u identify quantify tolerogenic dendritic cells..</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This study involve two group patient fulfil follow eligibility requirement : early ( 12 month duration ) active RA determine diagnostic criterion active status definition describe , time inclusion 25 ( OH ) vitamin D level 30 ng/ml . All RA patient study satisfy American Rheumatism Association 1987 revise criterion diagnosis RA . Active disease define presence least 3 swollen joint , ≥6 tender painful joint least 2 follow feature : duration morning stiffness 60 minute , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) ≥28 mm/hour serum CRP level least 2.0 mg/dl ( 26 ) . Only research subject either gender 18 year age older invited participate . One group , Group A , include active RA patient receive treatment methotrexate . A concomitant prescription nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , and/or Prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day allow . Treatment antiTNF agent , Abatacept immunosuppressives constitute exclusion criterion . To minimize impact preexist treatment final outcome trial , patient take NSAIDs and/or prednisone require receive unchanged dos medication least 1 month . No modification treatment allow study . In addition methotrexate treatment , patient within Group A receive placebo every day 12 consecutive month . The second group , Group B , include patient describe Group A instead placebo receive oral vitamin D , 1,000 unit every day 12 consecutive month add standard RA treatment . Because cancer autoimmune disease may frequent individual moderate deficiency vitamin D , subject history condition exclude . Because remote possibility vitamin Dinduced hypercalcemia , aim recruit patient RA otherwise healthy . We exclude patient past currently cancer ( except consider cured ) , kidney stone , chronic renal failure , congestive heart failure , arrythmia require treatment antiarrythmics , pulmonary condition require ambulatory oxygen , abnormal level calcium elevate PTH . Patients use Digoxin ( drug interaction ) , experience angina myocardial infarction last 3 year also exclude , patient whose coronary artery disease asymptomatic least 3 year congestive heart failure allow participate . Patients develop hypercalcemia , kidney stone , elevation 25 ( OH ) vitamin D &gt; 90 ng/ml also exclude .</criteria>
