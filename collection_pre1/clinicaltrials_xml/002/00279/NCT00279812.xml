	<brief_title>Selenium Immune Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One propose consequence marginal selenium status impair immune function . Establishing potential role selenium enhancer immune response vivo may provide evidence-base public health policy , important consequence prevent influenza similar disease elderly . The project consist placebo control selenium supplementation study dietary intervention un-enriched selenium enrich onion . In parallel group design , subject give either one three dos Selenomethionine ( 50 , 100 200µg selenium/day ) placebo per day selenium enrich un-enriched onion ( form test meal ) 12 week . Changes expression Se-responsive gene protein blood measure compare change plasma Se concentration select selenoproteins . The relationship dietary Se intake systemic mucosal immune response influenza vaccine examine . Changes immune cell population influence Se NK CD8 cytotoxicity determine flow cytometry .</detailed_description>
