	<brief_summary>We sight evaluate whether patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) epicardial fat patient without CAD , would suggest epicardial fat may “ innocent bystander ” actively involve disease process . Its role modulator vascular response myocardial function could potentially lead new area cardiac research . We also sight evaluate whether epicardial fat patient CAD release adipokines subcutaneous fat patient could prompt study differential regulation adipokine secretion tissue . Thus e.g. , use thiazolidinediones ( glitazones ) , statins , ARBs compound specifically modulate adipokine secretion could explore determine benefit ameliorate effect attributable increase epicardial fat .</brief_summary>
