	<brief_title>( Cost ) Effectiveness Study Exercise Therapy Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise therapy ( ET ) consider main conservative treatment patient intermittent claudication ( IC ) document effective , especially supervise . However , wide scale introduction supervise ET Netherlands would lead substantial increase health care cost compare current practice , cost-effectiveness supervise ET uncertain . ET follow pattern short walk period induce discomfort moderate intensity short rest period . The psychological , metabolic , mechanical alteration occur exercise stimulate adaptive response ultimately reduce symptom . The optimal therapy regimen depend large extent home-based exercise , require discipline patient . Currently , main prescription ET patient IC Netherlands single 'go home walk ' advice , without supervision follow-up . There evidence support effectiveness advice compliance low . In study compare 'go home walk ' advice supervise ET , large advantage supervise ET present . The inadequate use main conservative treatment peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) contribute gradual progression condition , decrease quality life , increase number vascular intervention . Furthermore , adequate ET , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , overweight , diabetes , present , well regulate .</detailed_description>
