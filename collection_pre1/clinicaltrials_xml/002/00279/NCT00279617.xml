	<brief_title>Levetiracetam Treatment Panic Disorder Lactate-Induced Panic Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>) Methods Procedures : Study Treatment : Study drug dosing : Levetiracetam open-label , follow titration schedule begin initial lactate infusion : Study day Levetiracetam dose 1-4 250 mg 5-7 500 mg 8-10 750 mg 11-14 1000 mg 15-18 1500 mg 19-21 2000 mg 22-25 2500 mg 26-28 3000 mg 29-56 3000 mg Levetiracetam titrate maximized clinical response ( total reduction panic attack intervene anxiety ) minimize side effect . Subjects develop bothersome side effect permit dose reduction alleviate side effect . Subjects unable tolerate levetiracetam 500 mg/d discontinue trial Study Design : This 8 week open-label trial antiepileptic agent , levetiracetam , treatment subject meet DSM-IV-TR criterion panic disorder . In addition , prior conclusion open-label trial , subject participate 1 hour intravenous ( IV ) lactate infusion determine whether levetiracetam administration block lactate-induced panic attack . Study procedure : Screening ( Visit 1 ) : Subjects provide write informed consent explanation study procedure . The Structured Interview DSM-IV anxiety disorder module administer confirm diagnosis panic disorder . A complete psychiatric medical history obtain physical examination , include vital sign , perform . Subjects must experience minimum one panic attack per week month precede study . Inclusion/exclusion criterion review subject assess compliance criterion . Subjects give panic attack diary record number panic attack experience day . Subjects give API . All female subject able child blood sample drawn laboratory evaluation β HCG . Subjects ask return one week . Baseline ( Visit 2 ) : Subjects return complete panic attack diary . Subjects administer HAM-A rating scale . Vital sign record . Subjects continue meet inclusion/exclusion criterion undergo 1 hour lactate infusion . Infusion procedure : Subjects recumbent bed make comfortable In intravenous line place antecubital fossa slow intravenous infusion 5 % dextrose water ( D5W ) administer 28 minute , accelerate 2 min . mimic subsequent lactate infusion . The intravenous solution view subject behind bedside screen . Subjects blind time lactate administration . At time 0 ( 30 min . D5W infusion ) , infusion 0.5 mol/L sodium DL-lactate ( body temperature ) initiate . The total dose ( 10 ml/kg body weight ) administer subsequent 20 min. , unless subject experience panic attack , case lactate infusion immediately discontinue . At time panic symptom , end 20 min. , subject switch back D5W 5 min. , follow termination infusion . Subjective symptom panic attack assess use 28-item Acute Panic Inventory . The API administer conclusion screen interview time ask describe typical panic attack , prior infusion D5W , prior lactate infusion , halfway lactate infusion ( 10 min . infusion ) , , precipitate , emergence panic attack . To meet criterion panic attack , subject must experience crescendo anxiety , fear apprehension , least 4 physical symptom list DSM-IV-TR panic attack . Subjects experience panic attack offer lorazepam 0.5 mg po alleviate panic attack symptom . Subjects begin open-label treatment levetiracetam follow initial lactate infusion . Levetiracetam titrate accord schedule described . Subjects experience lactate induce panic attack baseline eliminate study . Day 7 ( Visit 3 ) : The HAM-A administer panic attack diary review record . Adverse event review . Vital sign record . Study medication review adherence . Study medication dispense . Day 14 ( Visit 4 ) : The HAM-A administer panic attack diary review record . Adverse event review . Vital sign record . Study medication review adherence . Study medication dispense . Day 28 ( Visit 5 ) : The HAM-A administer panic attack diary review record . Adverse event review . Vital sign record . Study medication review adherence . Study medication dispense . Day 42 ( Visit 6 ) : The HAM-A administer panic attack diary review record . Adverse event review . Vital sign record . Study medication review adherence . Study medication dispense . Day 56 ( Visit 7 ) : The HAM-A administer panic attack diary review record . Adverse event review . Vital sign record . Subjects repeat lactate infusion procedure describe Visit 2 . At conclusion second lactate infusion , subject respond treatment levetiracetam offer 3 month continue treatment levetiracetam office visit charge subject appropriately refer continued follow-up treatment . Subjects respond levetiracetam treatment offer treatment FDA-approved medication panic disorder .</detailed_description>
