	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety bioactivity intramyocardial gene transfer use VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) patient ischemic heart failure . The research treatment CHF study involve use intramuscular injection catheter insert groin transfer type DNA ( phVEGF165 gene ) wall heart . Genes ( part DNA molecule ) carry instruction allow cell produce specific protein . Gene transfer treatment DNA ( necessary part cell ) study treatment patient heart failure . This research therapy , experimental proven , design try grow new blood vessel improve blood flow area heart receive enough blood . DNA present cell provide instruction make protein . After deliver piece DNA contain vascular endothelial growth factor 1 ( VEGF-1 ) gene ( product study ) cell , cell may produce specific protein call vascular endothelial growth factor 1 ( VEGF-1 ) . Animal study indicate VEGF-1 protein may cause new blood vessel grow . The Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Gene ( ph VEGF 165 ) find VEGF DNA . Experiments perform animal show heart wall , DNA direct cell heart muscle make VEGF protein . VEGF 165 protein show stimulate cell ( know endothelial cell ) , form inner line blood vessel . This protein cause cell divide grow , thereby form new blood vessel . It anticipate new blood supply may help heart pump blood effectively relieve heart failure symptom . We yet enough information know happen human , research . After gene transfer begin process help move stem cell bone marrow blood circulation . Subjects give drug call G-CSF ( drug use move cell bone marrow blood stream ) . Stem cell young cell produce bone marrow ( spongy cavity center large bone ) develop blood cell type cell . This medication trigger movement stem cell bone marrow blood stream . Before release blood stream , stem cell receive signal direct become specific type cell CD34+ cell ( endothelial progenitor cell ) . CD34+ cell move area damage heart tissue may promote growth new blood vessel supply blood nutrient thereby improve chance survival heart tissue , improve heart function , possibly long-term benefit . We recruit 12 subject study . There randomization placebo group . Once eligibility research study determine subject treat VEGF G-CSF .</brief_summary>
