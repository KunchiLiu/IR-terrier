	<brief_summary>Background Clonidine , derivate Imidazol , antihypertensive drug . It act stimulate adrenergic receptor nerve brain Imidazol-receptors . As result , clonidine slows heart rate reduces blood pressure . Clonidine approve FDA 1974 register Austria brand name “ Catapresan ” . Alpha2 adrenergic agonist nowadays use topically eye drop glaucoma treatment . In addition know effect lower intraocular pressure , alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist neuroprotective . Brimonidine , commonly use topical alpha-2 agonist , currently market treatment glaucoma effective reduce intraocular pressure . It , however , show brimonidine potent vasoconstrictor ciliary body thus reduce aqueous humor production . Little , however , know potential vasoconstrictor effect brimonidine posterior pole eye . This clinical importance , optic nerve head ischemia appear contribute glaucoma pathophysiology . Direct investigation ocular hemodynamic effect brimonidine , however , difficult , lower intraocular pressure brimonidine may confound result due concomitant change ocular perfusion pressure . The aim present study assess effect intravenous clonidine model drug alpha agonists ocular blood flow IOP healthy human . Study objectives : To investigate effect clonidine ocular blood flow intraocular pressure .</brief_summary>
