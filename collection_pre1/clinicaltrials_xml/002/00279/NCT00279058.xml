	<brief_summary>Melanoma main cause death patient skin cancer . Once metastasize , cancer show respond chemotherapy rare case . Immunotherapy represent approach treatment base immune response cancer antigens . The principal objective study identify whether dendritic cell-based vaccine increase moderate therapeutic effect bolus high dose IL-2 patient metastatic melanoma . For purpose , patient metastatic melanoma certain blood type ( HLA-A201+ ) treat systemically high dose IL-2 . In one group patient , IL-2 precede three dos autologous dendritic cell pulse melanoma antigen appropriate blood type . Two cycle three DC vaccine administer every 14 day intra-lymph node injection , follow high dose IL-2 treatment . Responding patient receive additional DC vaccine 1 month 2 month interval . In second group , patient receive standard high dose IL-2 protocol within comparable period time . Each group include 12 patient . A complete evaluation evaluable lesion perform prior accrual , initial 3 DC vaccine , six week first IL-2 treatment , total 6 DC vaccine 6 week second cycle IL-2 treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Any patient age 18 65 , measurable metastatic melanoma expect survival great three month . All patient HLAA2 positive Patient must receive accepted standard treatmnet melanoma DTIC containing protocol , unless unwilling . Patients fail previous treatment IL2 include compassionate basis IL2 plus vaccination scheme without included analysis . 2. serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dl less , 3 . Total bilirubin 1.6 mg/dl less , except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . 4 . WBC 3000/mm3 great 5. platelet count 90,000 mm3 great 6. serum AST/ALT le two time normal 7 . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . 8 . Patients gender must willing practice effective birth control trial . 9 . Patient agree participate study sign write informed consent , 10 . The patient must eligible receive IL2 . Patients exclude : 1. undergo undergone past 3 week form therapy except surgery cancer . 2. active systemic infection , coagulation disorder , autoimmune disease major medical illness cardiovascular respiratory system know immunodeficiency disease . 3. require steroid therapy . 4. pregnant ( possible side effect fetus ) . 5. known positive hepatitis BsAG , HCV , HIV antibody ( possible immune effect condition ) . 6. form primary secondary immunodeficiency . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) 7. allergic egg . i. active major medical illness cardiac ischemia evidence stress thallium comparable test , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease ( eligible receive IL2 ) j . Have abnormal thyroid function ( eligible receive IL2 ) .</criteria>
