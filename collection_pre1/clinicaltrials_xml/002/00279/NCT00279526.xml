	<detailed_description>Introduction The number Israel ’ elderly ( 65 plus ) increase 85,200 ( 4.8 % population ) 1955 approximately 670,000 people ( 10 % ) 2003 ( Brodsky et al. , 2005 ) . According conservative three projection offer Israeli Central Bureau Statistics ( CBS ) , number senior expect approximately 676,500 ( 9.8 % population ) 2005 , rise 722,500 people ( 10.7 % population ) 2010 increase 1,025,800 ( almost 12 % population ) year 2020 . The increase life expectancy 20th century result major growth prevalence age-related disease condition . Depression find prevalent among various mental disorder later life third common reason consultation primary care ( Shah , 1992 ) . Research show 10-15 % person 65 year age suffer various level depressive symptom ( Jacob &amp; Palmer , 1998 ) . Sadock &amp; Sadock ( 2003 ) state depression among elderly may reach 15 percent among suffer dementia 25- 50 percent . Israeli study show similar rate depressive symptomatology perform Western country . A prevalence 21.5 percent depressive symptomatology find among random sample 937 Israeli adult . ( Iancu et al. , 2003 ) . Depression represent heterogeneous set disorder , usually characterize sad mood inability experience pleasure . Among elderly often may present atypically , somatic symptom dominate clinical picture ( Jacob &amp; Palmer , 1998 ) . Common physical complaint , start common feature loss energy fatigue , unexplained pain , gastrointestinal symptom , headache , dizziness , palpitation , heartburn , numbness , loss appetite , insomnia specifically early morning awakening . In general , unexplained somatic complaint physical symptom patient , high likelihood depression ( Glass 2003 ) . Elderly depression impairs significantly quality life lead disability , cognitive impairment , intensify symptoms medical condition increase utilization health care service direct indirect medical cost ( Luber et al. , 2001 ) . Herrman et al. , ( 2002 ) argue health care utilization among depressed patient higher among without depression . Elderly depressive symptom find least twice likely use emergency department medical inpatient hospital service compare patient without depressive symptomatology ( Himelhoch et al. , 2002 ) . Simon &amp; Ormel ( 1995 ) well Katon et al . ( 2003 ) state patient depressive symptom account 43-52 % high health care cost patient without depressive symptom . The increase cost associate depressive symptom note even adjust severity chronic medical illness ( Glass , 2003 ) . According WHO significance illness burden attributable depression increase age thus grow year 2020 base upon project demographic shift towards old population ( Peveler et al. , 2002 ) . This trend show Israel Brodsky et al . ( 2005 ) . They report elderly average 11.5 visit FP per year , USA , 25 % elderly population visit physician 10 time annually – include visit ER home visit ( Health , United States,2003 ) . Consequently detect treat elderly patient depressive symptom Israel , may cost-effective produce improvement health well-being money spend care older adult . However depression age patient may atypical nature difficult diagnose general population . Therefore often under-diagnosed under-treated ( Jacob &amp; Palmer , 1998 ) . In contrast younger depress patient , elderly patient often avoid report show mood level tend hide state disease , bad , lack consciousness disease think enjoy life less inevitable consequence age . Moreover , elderly sometimes attribute depressive symptom general medical condition . Other factor may hinder distinguish depression condition also concomitant disease , especially dementia , polypharmacy drug reaction ( Glass , 2003 ) . Furthermore Hybels et al .

The obtained result indicate need recognize elderly adult meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM ) criterion depression , fall threshold instrument Center Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale ( CES-D ) , may still experience depressive symptomatology warrant attention . The current scale use today measure physical deterioration part depressive state , among old people part age process may confuse therapist .

( Zalsman et al. , 1998 ) . Today one widely used instrument screen depression among elderly population . To simplify screen process Yale Task Force Geriatric Assessment recommend use single question , `` Do often feel sad depress ? '' ( Lachs et al. , 1990 ) . Mahoney et al . ( 1994 ) find question valid reliable short-form alternative . In conclusion depression prevalent mental disorder later life considerable impend public health problem since may lay unnecessary cost burden one hand difficult diagnose . Consequently , need find effective way early detection condition . This study examine question whether high health care service utilization and/ sociodemographic background may predict presence depression among aged patient .
