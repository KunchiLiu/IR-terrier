	<brief_summary>Does new colonoscopic viewing technique call narrow band imaging ( NBI ) help doctor detect patient least one pre-cancerous polyp ( adenoma ) conventional colonoscopy use white light alone ? May 2007 protocol minor amendment : additional viewing endoscopists outside St Mark 's ro allow assessment inter- intra-observer variability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer second commonest cause cancer death . In majority case precede precancerous lesion call adenoma ( polyp ) . Detection removal adenoma colonoscopy show reduce death rate colorectal cancer . However , despite meticulous examination `` miss rate '' adenoma colonoscopy range 66-25 % back-to-back colonoscopy study . The nature polyps well pedunculated ( cherry like ) flat depress make difficult see , may contribute `` miss rate '' . The factor , influence endoscopist detection well study . Polyp detection rate wary widely , even among expert . Techniques highlight lesion advanced recent year . Chromoendoscopy , current gold standard technique , rely spray dye bowel lining , show help pick pre-cancerous polyp two three study ; however widely used time consume require extra equipment training . Narrow band imaging ( NBI ) technique relies light filter improve contrast small blood vessel bowel line show adenomas rich vascular network . It sometimes describe `` digital chromoendoscopy '' image produce similar chromoendoscopy , much simpler quicker use . Autofluorescence endoscopy us short wavelength light light filter produce false colour image bowel line polyp stand . These technique use success oesophagus stomach little work available colon . We aim see NBI well standard colonoscopy detect precancerous polyp . This likely similar chromoendoscopy already show help . If polyp find use type endoscopy , particularly NBI magnification autofluorescence see technique helpful discriminate pre-cancerous non pre-cancerous polyp . May 2007 protocol minor amendment : additional viewing endoscopists outside St Mark 's ro allow assessment inter- intra-observer variability . No additional data collect .</detailed_description>
