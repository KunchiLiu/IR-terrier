	<brief_title>The Effect Laser Hair Removal Permanent Hair Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laser hair removal become one popular commonly perform procedure cosmetic dermatology . However , relatively little known mechanism involve achieve clinically appear permanent reduction hair density treat area . We postulate order achieve permanent hair reduction , stem cell locate bulge region follicle must destroy . Recently , marker follicular stem cell ( keratin 15 ) identify note detectable use immunohistochemical technique . In addition , several immunohistochemical marker various component hair follicle available . We propose quantitatively measure effect laser hair removal immunohistochemical staining property treat follicle respect keratin 15 follicular marker . We hypothesize degree stain greatly reduce follow laser therapy , thus provide , knowledge , first biochemical evidence support permanence treatment 's effect .</detailed_description>
