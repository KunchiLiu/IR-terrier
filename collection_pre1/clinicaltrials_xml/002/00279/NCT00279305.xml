	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes autoimmune disease immune system mistakenly attack insulin-producing beta cell pancreas . Without beta cell , body maintain proper blood glucose level response daily activity eat exercise . With few insulin produce cell blood glucose increase , cause hunger , thirst , unexplained weight loss . By time symptom develop , 80-90 % person 's beta cell already destroy . However , also mean 10-20 % cell remain continue produce insulin . Scientists learn two type immune cell , B cell T cell , involve cause type 1 diabetes . T cell responsible attack destroy beta cell make insulin . Although n't attack insulin produce cell , B cell may trigger T cell attack . This study investigate use rituximab see help lower number immune B cell thereby prevent destruction remain insulin produce beta cell remain diagnosis . Rituximab approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment condition call B-lymphocyte lymphoma . Its effect immune system well understood use organ transplantation . Research show rituximab might helpful treat condition cause T cell B cell , include type 1 diabetes . The goal study find rituximab preserve residual insulin secretion prevent beta cell destruction type 1 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study randomize , two-arm , trial 2/3 participant receive study drug , remain 1/3 receive placebo ( pretend medicine nothing ) . The group assign decide chance ( toss coin draw straw ) . Neither doctor able choose group . Also , neither researcher know group . Participants take rituximab , placebo , week first 4 week study . It give intravenous infusion clinical center . Participants need return clinical center visit every 3 month two year ; participant continue secrete insulin follow-up additional two year .</detailed_description>
