	<brief_summary>Beta ( 2 ) -adrenergic receptor ( BAR ) agonists important group drug use treatment asthma . In child unresponsive inhaled BAR agonist therapy , high dose systemic BAR agonist therapy frequently next step treatment . Despite widespread use intravenous BAR agonist therapy pediatric status asthmaticus , controversy regard efficacy therapy . A number study establish genetic variation BAR important effect modulate response BAR agonist therapy asthma . In particular , change amino acid position 16 BAR gene think functionally important . Patients encode two glycine amino acid , rather arginine , position appear severe asthma respond differently acute BAR agonist therapy . Our hypothesis genotypic difference may contribute poor response acute BAR agonist treatment . We propose conduct prospective observational study determine influence patient 's BAR genotype response acute BAR agonist therapy . Our specific hypothesis child genetic polymorphism gene encode BAR decrease response acute high-dose continuous BAR therapy ( inhaled intravenous ) compare child . Our primary outcome ICU length stay . Secondary outcomes 1. assess rate improvement clinical asthma score base genotype , 2. attempt correlate asthma phenotype genotype compare demographic data hospital course .</brief_summary>
