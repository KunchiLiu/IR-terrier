	<brief_summary>Asthma COPD characterize airway narrow . The potent , physiological mechanism lead bronchodilation take deep inspiration . This protect healthy subject bronchoconstrictive stimulus , reverse pre-existing bronchoconstriction . However , deep breath-induced bronchoprotection -bronchodilation impair asthma . We question whether specific asthma ( comparison COPD ) , whether associate bronchial inflammation -remodelling . The study two-groups comparison , physiological pathological disease marker , obtain methacholine challenge , monitoring airway resistance , take bronchial biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Towards Restoring Physiological Inhibition Airway Narrowing Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale . Asthma associate variable airway obstruction airways inflammation . It generally assume inflammatory mechanism promote airway narrow , stimulate airway smooth muscle geometrical change airway wall . Healthy subject effectively protect stimuli airway narrow , mechanism apparently fail asthma . The potent inhibitor airway narrow healthy subject take deep inspiration . This prevent reverse bronchoconstriction ( DI-induced bronchoprotection -bronchodilation , respectively ) , less effective absent asthma . The DI-induced inhibition airway narrow normal subject presumably due relaxation smooth muscle mechanical stretch release relaxant mediator ( endogenous NO ) . Such mechanism might become impaired asthma , secondary e.g . mechanical uncoupling smooth muscle surround parenchyma ( e.g . congestion edema ) , altered structure function airway smooth muscle , and/or reduce inhibitory mediator release . It postulate impaired response deep inspiration central pathophysiological feature asthma age . Therefore , believe imperative address , identify restore inhibitory pathway patient asthma . Hypotheses . We hypothesize DI-induced bronchoprotection –broncho¬dilation : 1. associate cellular morphological feature airways inflammation , 2. restore deep insufflation rather deep inspiration , pharmacological intervention aim reduce microvascular congestion increase endogenous nitric oxide synthesis.. Design method . To examine extent DI-responses differ asthma COPD adulthood , whether associate feature airways inflammation change smooth muscle function . 12 Adult patient asthma 12 COPD undergo single-dose methacholine challenge , prohibition DI 's 5 DI 's prior challenge cross-over design , measure airway resistance . On separate day bronchial biopsy obtain immunohistochemistry inflammatory cell marker , vascularity , microvascular leakage , myosin light chain kinase , NO-synthases , arginase .</detailed_description>
