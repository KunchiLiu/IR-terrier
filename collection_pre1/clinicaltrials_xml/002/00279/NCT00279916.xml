	<brief_title>Short Term Relief Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Serous Otitis Media Using Intranasal Steroid Sprays</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term serous otitis medium ( SOM ) generally refer accumulation fluid within middle ear space absence sign indicate acute infection . Other frequently encounter description condition include otitis medium effusion , secretory otitis medium , non-suppurative otitis medium , mucoid otitis medium , `` glue ear . '' Commonly , OME result conductive hearing loss due restriction tympanic membrane mobility well alteration acoustic property middle ear space round window . In addition hearing loss , adult condition may complain aural fullness increase risk acquire acute otitis medium . Negative middle ear pressure relatively common find adult often precursor development SOM . At time , NMEP may great enough induce medial retraction tympanic membrane and/or drape ossicles—often refer tympanic membrane atelectasis . This condition may see without middle ear effusion . As SOM , NMEP also unique effect acoustic property middle ear result conductive hearing loss . Retraction tympanic membrane may ultimately lead formation middle ear adhesion ( adhesive otitis medium ) and/or acquire cholesteatoma . Both SOM NMEP elements clinical spectrum result , part , dysfunction eustachian tube . The properly functioning eustachian tube affords ventilation middle ear cavity necessary prevent development negative pressure gradient result middle ear mucosal gas absorption . In turn , negative pressure develop within middle ear , serous transudate may form tympanic membrane may retract . Other function eustachian tube include act outlet clearance glandular secretion and/or debris nasopharynx well form protective barrier ( collapse ) ascend nasopharyngeal pathogen barotrauma . Eustachian tube dysfunction ( ETD ) set SOM NMEP primarily refer absent inadequate ability open eustachian tube . The common cause persistent ETD adult rhinitis ( allergic rhinitis , vasomotor rhinitis , mixed rhinitis ) . In instance , hypothesize severity rhinitis might subclinical term cause typical symptom ( rhinorrhea , nasal obstruction , anosmia ) , yet still sufficient severity region eustachian tube orifice cause ETD . Most attempt address ETD medically patient rhinitis aim decrease mucosal swell . Although many varied therapeutic intervention devise treat ETD , single therapy proven clearly efficacious and/or gain widespread acceptance . In 2001 , van Heerbeek et al1 review result report many intervention animal model human . Medical intervention review included topical aerosolize surfactant , systemic beta alpha adrenoreceptor agonist ( among decongestant ) , systemic antihistamine , agent aim improve mucociliary function . Although intervention ( surfactant decongestant ) show positive effect study , remain disagreement result various report , particular , lack prospective randomize double-blind placebo-controlled study . The author conclude sufficient data clearly support particular therapy human time . Of particular note , separate report van Heerbeek also demonstrate effect single dose topical application nasal decongestant ( alpha receptor agonist ) ETD child randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study use sophisticated measure eustachian tube function . Surgical intervention aim treat ETD include PE tube placement and/or adenoidectomy . Multiple study report improvement underlie ETD pressure-equalization tube placement—despite improvement resolution SOM and/or tympanic membrane atelectasis . In fact , author report worsened eustachian tube function follow pressure-equalization tube placement . Studies relate adenoidectomy deal pediatric population , general , also fail demonstrate improvement ETD . Recently , Silverstein report preliminary result non-controlled study direct application dexamethasone tympanic-side orifice eustachian tube via wick pass pressure-equalization tube . Data limit study small cohort patient indicate positive effect term resolve patient complaint aural fullness eventually convert tympanograms type A . Some clinician suggest nasal steroid spray may role deal ETD cause SOM NMEP . Specific attempt address effect nasal steroid application ETD limit . Most study exist indeed suggest benefit child , generally limit scope definitively demonstrate statistically significant benefit . To knowledge , study exist deal adult patient . We aware 4 study address treatment SOM nasal steroid child ; aware study specifically deal NMEP . In 1982 , Shapiro study 45 child allergic rhinitis SOM prospectively compare aerosolize nasal dexamethasone placebo . Normal middle ear pressure encounter frequently group treat dexamethasone 1 2 week interval suggest benefit short-term ; statistical significance find two group study end week 3 . The author conclude aerosolized dexamethasone therapeutic efficacy , recommend treatment limit 2 week . That year , Lildholdt Korthol report data 70 child treat either intranasal beclomethasone placebo find statistical difference resolution effusion 4 week . The author conclude active therapeutic effect study population . In 1998 Tracy evaluate benefit add intranasal steroid oral antibiotic regimen vs oral antibiotic plus placebo vs oral antibiotic alone study group 61 child find frequent resolution effusion note otoscopy , tympanometry , symptom questionnaire steroid therapy 1 2 month . The benefit also note 3 month reach statistical significance . The author conclude intranasal steroid might useful adjunct prophylactic antibiotic therapy . Finally , 2002 , similar study Karlidag demonstrate 8 week resolution rate SOM child 39 % regimen antibiotic nasal steroid compare rate 24 % antibiotic alone 5 % treatment . Roughly 20 child treatment arm . However , study sample small statistical significance . It note study base pediatric subject . Many believe mechanic ETD differs child adult . Given variation anatomy key immunologic factor adult child SOM , difficult know application limit pediatric study might adult patient population . Newer intranasal steroid preparation generally safe relatively side effect demonstrate large study deal allergic rhinitis . Due lack single accept medical intervention deal ETD general benign nature condition , common practice physician take `` wait see '' initial approach clinical entity encounter lieu prescribe unproved medication . It generally accept patient NMEP and/or SOM undergo spontaneous resolution symptom , yet exact resolution rate clearly define .</detailed_description>
