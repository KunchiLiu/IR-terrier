	<brief_summary>Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) cause sickness death old people every winter . This study investigate age affect body 's immune response ( body 's response disease ) RSV . About 2000 people , age 21 old , reside upstate NY area , recruit . Two group subject study . The 1st group volunteer recruit prior start RSV season year 1 study . These volunteer include healthy people people various medical condition . The 2nd group volunteer patient admit Rochester General Hospital acute respiratory illness . Procedures include draw blood vein arm ( 2 tablespoon ) , collect nasal swab , collect sputum . Volunteers may participate study related procedure 3 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Respiratory infection account significant excess morbidity mortality among old people winter . Influenza A virus Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) emerge two important virus age group . The resultant morbidity mortality among population substantial . Natural RSV infection adult various age mild , moderate , severe RSV disease evaluate order accomplish follow primary objective : ass effect age immune response natural RSV infection ; assess effect age clearance RSV infection ; assess effect age innate immune response natural RSV infection ; ass possibility virus spread low airway ; assess role RSV-specific immune response pathogenesis severe disease . Study participant include approximately 2000 person , male female , great equal age 21 , include healthy person , person common medical condition ( i.e. , hypertension , diabetes , thyroid condition , arthritis , coronary artery disease , skin cancer , etc ) , person underlie chronic pulmonary cardiac condition , person sign symptom acute respiratory tract illness reside Upstate , New York area . A prospective cohort ~800 person recruit prior onset RSV season year one follow respiratory illness RSV season three year subject document RSV illness . This group contain person various age spectrum medical condition . This population use evaluate age-related difference immune response RSV viral shed patterns.These volunteer expect provide primarily case mild moderately severe RSV disease . A second group subject sign symptom acute respiratory tract illness recruit Lifetime After hour Urgent Care Center , Rochester General Hospital emergency room inpatient medical service . Those identified RSV infection provide case moderate severe RSV disease . At end RSV season , control group select . This group comprise subject choose prospective cohort RSV infection winter season . Controls match age underlying condition RSV infect subject . The following outcome measure assess : RSV severity : severe disease=hospitalized case , mild-moderate disease=non-hospitalized case ; virus load : quantity duration RSV shed determine quantitative RT-PCR ; T cell response ; antibody : acute serum IgG RSV F G proteins EIA neutralization titer RSV A2 B1 virus depend upon infect strain ; local innate immune response : maximum IL-6 IL-8 MIP-1 alpha level nasal secretion ; systemic innate immune response : maximum number NK cell peripheral blood ; systemic inflammation : maximum serum IL-6 C reactive protein value .</detailed_description>
