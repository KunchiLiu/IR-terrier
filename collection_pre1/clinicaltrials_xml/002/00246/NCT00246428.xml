	<detailed_description>The long term objective program research develop effective intervention reduce problem drinking associate problem among adolescent young adult enhance intervention approach identify effective element treatment derive cognitive behavioral social learn theory . Current approach behavior change area frequently rely school-based primary prevention program address cessation/reduction issue adolescent already drink , rarely address motivational issue relate use abuse , target school dropout . Recently , two study show Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) effective alcohol-involved adolescent compare control intervention condition , show great harm-reduction effect alcohol consumption effect . In addition , mechanism MI elucidate . The major purpose study compare MI minimal contrast condition personalize feedback provide , determine additional booster session enhance outcomes . The population old adolescent treat Emergency Department ( ED ) follow alcohol-related event . Thus , school dropout , high-risk population , include study . A 2 ( MI versus Feedback Only ) x 2 ( two booster session versus booster ) factorial design use examine whether MI combine booster effectively change subsequent alcohol use alcohol problem . Experimental manipulation evaluate 6 , 9 , 12 month baseline intervention . The study design several strength : ( 1 ) enable investigation main effect MI versus Feedback Only , provide stringent test active ingredient MI current competitive segment permit ; ( 2 ) enable evaluation effect continue contact separate factor ; ( 3 ) allow test interaction baseline intervention type booster contact . A secondary purpose study use explicit mediational analysis , test within Structural Equation Modeling framework , examine hypothesis stage change , use behavioral alcohol reduction strategy , alcohol treatment seek mediate relationship intervention outcome . Finally , study determine whether diagnosis alcohol abuse dependence affect responsivity intervention . In addition potential contribut8ion theory , importance work potential provide cos-effective brief intervention `` teachable moment '' increase high-risk patient ' interest reducing harmful drinking relate risk-taking behavior .</detailed_description>
