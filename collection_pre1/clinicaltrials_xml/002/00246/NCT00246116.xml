	<brief_title>Functional Imaging Treatment Effects : A Companion Protocol Study Extracranial Stereotactic Radioablation Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One shortcomings trial design recognize phase I study assessment local effect , relate tumor control adjacent tissue toxicity . For example , response rate generally incomplete therapy , especially low dose level cohort , clear patient residual viable tumor capable sustain growth . Repeat biopsy population prohibitively toxic . We generally follow patient chest x-rays CT 's evidence progression . At point , would perform PET scan repeat systemic staging . Since majority patient retain residual `` abnormality '' worrisome residual disease , ideally , would data test capable characterizing abnormality earlier post-treatment course . In token , several patient phase I study post treatment imaging change around tumor target . If patient symptomatic decline , never clear treatment effect around target actually involve overall decline . Certainly , patient population select medical problem continue cause poor health . Ideally , though , would refer data indicate degree damage surround normal lung ESR realistic assessment percentage overall organ damage therapy ascertain .</detailed_description>
