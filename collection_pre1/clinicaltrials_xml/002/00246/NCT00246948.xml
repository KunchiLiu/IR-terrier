	<detailed_description>Summary Background Data . Sciatica result herniated disk fairly common problem ; study show life time prevalence 4-5 % Scandinavian population . Though herniated disk benign disease relatively good prognosis , pain functional loss , patient rather considerable period month Reviews demonstrate little efficacy passive conservative treatment modality . Results surgery conflicting . Cohort study show high efficacy active treatment modality patient sciatica . The current trend back treatment information advice stay active include active treatment modality patient give responsibility treatment process treatment assume role `` coach '' . Objectives . To evaluate efficacy two active conservative treatment program patient severe sciatica . Methods A prospective clinical control randomized trial include 181 consecutive patient radicular pain knee . The patient examine baseline , 8 week later post treatment follow-up , , MR-scanned baseline one year follow-up The treatment consist four element ; 1-3 identical group . 1 . Thorough information concern anatomy , pathogenesis , discs heal without surgery , encouragement stay active possible reduce activity increase leg pain occur . 2 . Tender love care . 3 . Medication , optional weak analgesic NSAID 'S recommend . Element 4 divide `` Hands '' `` Hands '' , utilize two different exercise program . `` Hands '' consist variety back related exercise optional manual treatment . The exercise give strict algorithm , different symptom response exercise determine exercise give . `` Hands '' exercise optional generally back relate .
