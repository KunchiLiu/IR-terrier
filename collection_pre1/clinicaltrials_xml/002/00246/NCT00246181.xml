	<brief_title>Phase I II Study Of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Medically Unresectable Patients With Stage 1 NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The common treatment early stage lung cancer remove cancer surgery . Patients serious underlie health problem like emphysema , diabetes , heart disease develop early stage lung cancer may eligible standard surgical treatment . The common alternative surgery conventional radiation treatment call fractionate radiotherapy . `` Fractionated radiotherapy '' mean several week treatment daily radiation session . While treatment sometimes successful kill cancer , effective surgery may significantly damage surround lung tissue . Newer treatment use radiotherapy develop used patient metastasis ( spread cancer ) lung . Stereotactic radiotherapy use frame guide highly focused beam radiation cancer avoid normal surround tissue . Stereotactic radiotherapy also use high daily dose radiation . The high daily dose may effective conventional radiotherapy kill cancer cell may also decrease side effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Consistent therapeutic oncology trial , patient actively `` recruit , '' screen physician appropriate clinical trial ( ) time routine clinic visit . All patient must willing capable provide inform consent participate protocol . Eligible patient must appropriate stag study identify AJCC stage I ( T1 T2 , N0 , M0 ) primary lung carcinoma . The patient direct evidence regional distant metastasis appropriate stag study . Histologic confirmation require either biopsy cytology . The following primary cancer type eligible : Squamous cell carcinoma , Adenocarcinoma , Large cell carcinoma , bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma nonsmall cell ; otherwise specify . The primary tumor must deem technically resectable experienced thoracic cancer clinician , reasonable possibility obtain gross total resection negative margin ( define potentially curative resection , PCR ) ; however , patient underlie physiological medical problem would prohibit PCR due low probability tolerate general anesthesia , operation , postoperative recovery period , removal adjacent functioning lung . Standard `` cutoff `` guideline regard surgical resection NSCLC include follow : Baseline FEV1 &lt; 40 % , postoperative predict FEV1 &lt; 30 % , severely reduced diffusion capacity , baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia exercise oxygen consumption &lt; 50 % predict . Patients refuse PCR due preference , ideology , emotional psychological issue , mental illness , inability give consent PCR specific accept medical contraindication PCR eligible . Eligible patient previous lung mediastinal radiotherapy . There must plan patient receive concomitant antineoplastic therapy protocol . Patients receive chemotherapy within 8 week start date study ineligible . Patients must able fit inside stereotactic body frame able undergo CT MRI scan frame . The patient 's primary tumor must large 7.0 cm great dimension . Patients active systemic , pulmonary , pericardial infection ineligible . Pregnant lactate woman ineligible . Women/men reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method condom/diaphragm spermicidal foam , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , prescription birth control pill . Patients must past 18th birthday time registration . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 . See inclusion criterion .</criteria>
