	<brief_summary>The primary objective two study test hypothesis daily ingestion dietary supplement , Selected Vegetables Herbs Mix ( SV ) , consist non-toxic botanical contain know anti-cancer and/or immune enhance component , may prolong survival time stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient . Either SV placebo add daily diet double-blind randomized fashion , 2 chance 3 receive SV 1 chance 3 receive placebo . - Study 1 : For newly diagnose patient receive receive less 4 week , standard chemotherapy regimen . - Study 2 : For stop refuse standard chemotherapy receive best supportive care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Selected Vegetable Herb Mix ( SV ) Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carcinoma lung lead cause cancer relate death North America . Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) cause death 400,000 patient annually US Western Europe . The benefit conventional therapy , chemotherapy radiotherapy , unresectable stage IIIB IV NSCLC patient small ; generally accept median survival time late stage patient remain 4-6 month `` Supportive Care '' group 6-9 month chemotherapy treatment group ; one-year survival 20 % . Ideal Treatment NSCLC : The toxicity chemotherapy side-effects radiotherapy quality life patient major issue cancer treatment . It significant enough many patient choose forgo standard treatment . Furthermore , current chemotherapy advance NSCLC quite expensive , $ 50,000 $ 100,000 per year . Therefore , ideal treatment advance NSCLC patient meet follow criterion : 1 . Prolong patient survival . 2 . Minimal toxicity . 3 . Improvement patient 's quality life . 4 . Relatively inexpensive . A phytomix consist select vegetable herbs appear meet criterion . The phytomix consist 19 vegetable herb highly concentrated form . These vegetable herbs select base anti-cancer immune-enhancing activity . Each batch raw material go strict quality control ( QC ) scheme make sure product meet QC standard devoid deleterious contamination , heavy metal , pesticide , aflatoxin , microorganism . The manufacturing process tightly control ensure batch-to-batch consistency . The final product , 20 gram freeze-dried powder , seal pouch . In previous study , patient ingest phytomix daily 17-60 month show clinical sign adverse effect . The Objectives propose study evaluate benefit adverse reaction add SV daily diet cancer patient willing undergo chemotherapy ( Study 1 ) refuse chemotherapy ( Study 2 ) .</detailed_description>
