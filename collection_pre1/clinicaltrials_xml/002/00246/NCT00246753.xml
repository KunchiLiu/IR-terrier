	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lapatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well lapatinib work treat patient prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine proportion patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer experience &gt; 50 % decline PSA treatment lapatinib ditosylate . Secondary - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine time PSA progression patient treat drug . - Determine molecular correlate predictive biomarkers response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label study . Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Serum sample collect biomarker analysis baseline every 4 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
