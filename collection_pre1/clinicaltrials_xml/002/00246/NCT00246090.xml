	<criteria>1 . Female patient histologically cytologically confirm carcinoma breast . Every effort make make paraffin embed tissue slide diagnostic biopsy surgical specimen available confirmation diagnosis . 2 . Patients locally advance metastatic disease receive least two ( five ) prior chemotherapeutic regimen breast cancer , least one administer treatment locally advance metastatic disease . Prior therapy must document follow criterion prior entry onto study : Regimens must include anthracycline ( eg , doxorubicin , epirubicin ) , taxane ( eg , paclitaxel , docetaxel ) capecitabine combination order . One two regimen may administer adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant therapy . Patients human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2/neu ) overexpressing tumor must additionally treat trastuzumab . Patients estrogen receptorexpressing tumor may additionally treat estrogenspecific therapy . Prior hormonal therapy , biological therapy , ( eg , trastuzumab , bevacizumab ) , immunotherapy , count one 2 5 prior chemotherapy regimen allow . However , hormonal therapy must discontinue one week administration E7389 , biological therapy must discontinue two week E7389 administration . Patients treated bisphosphonates enter study allow continue medication long dose change . In case change dose deem necessary , case need discuss Sponsor . 3 . Progression within six month last regimen advance disease , document following : The date treatment , dos , outcome therapy reason discontinuation prior anthracycline , taxane , capecitabine , trastuzumab therapy must provide . Prior entry onto study , information ensure last therapy fulfills eligibility criterion require , include progression receive last prior chemotherapy regimen , within six month receive therapy . Chemotherapy medication administration sheet official medical/hospital record indicate type date chemotherapy must available inspection , one follow reason discontinuation medication require : radiographic evidence progression , doctor 's office hospitalization note document radiologic progression , clinically documented increase tumor burden , and/or increase tumorspecific marker . 4 . Patients measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , define least one lesion accurately measure least one diameter ( least 10 mm long diameter [ LD ] spiral computer tomography [ CT ] scan ) , least 20 mm standard technique . If measurable lesion lymph node , must measure least 20 mm LD . If single lesion identify target lesion , biopsy aspiration cytological histological confirmation diagnosis breast carcinoma require . 5 . Resolution chemotherapy radiationrelated toxicity less Grade 2 severity , except stable sensory neuropathy ≤ Grade 2 alopecia . 6 . Age &gt; = 18 year . 7 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 2 . 8 . Life expectancy ≥ 3 month . 9 . Adequate renal function evidence serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/minute ( min ) per Cockcroft Gault formula . 10 . Adequate bone marrow function evidence absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 x 10^9/L hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL ( acceptable correct therapeutic intervention transfusional support ) , platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L . 11 . Adequate liver function evidence bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL alkaline phosphatase , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≤ 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( case liver metastases ≤ 5 x ULN ) , unless bone metastasis , case liver specific alkaline phosphatase must separate total use ass liver function instead total alkaline phosphatase . 12 . Willing able complete European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) quality life assessment , Analgesic Diary , Pain Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . 13 . Willing able comply study protocol duration study . 14 . Written inform consent prior studyspecific screening procedure understand patient may withdraw consent time without prejudice . 1 . Patients must receive chemotherapy , radiation , biologic therapy within two week , hormonal therapy within one week , trastuzumab within three week , E7389 treatment start . 2 . Patients must receive radiation therapy encompass &gt; 30 % marrow ( lesion irradiate use target lesion , unless progress irradiation ) . 3 . Patients must preexist neuropathy &gt; Grade 2 . 4 . Patients must participate prior E7389 clinical trial .</criteria>
