	<brief_title>An Open-label Study Evaluating Maintenance Clinical Effect Adult Schizophrenia Patients Switched From Risperidone Tablets Equivalent Dose Rapidly-dissolving Tablet Formulation Risperdone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial non-randomized , open-label , single arm , multicentre study aim evaluate maintenance clinical effect rapidly-dissolving tablet dosage form risperidone , patient switch previous equivalent dose conventional risperidone tablet ( dose 0.5 mg , 1 mg , 2 mg , 3 mg 4 mg/day ) . Approximately 100 adult schizophrenia patient ( age &gt; = 18 year ) symptomatically stable enrol . Patients ask take equivalent dose rapidly-dissolving tablet form risperidone 4 week treatment . Other psychotropic medication take study entry may continue throughout study , provide dose stable prior entry minimum 4 week remain stable throughout course study . Dose escalation/reduction rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablet permit . Study visit take place twice 4 week period , study entry final visit . The primary efficacy parameter CGI-Severity ( CGI-S ) score maintenance clinical effect . Secondarily , two 5-point Likert scale complete , one measuring clinician 's assessment anxiety symptom measure clinician 's assessment depressive symptom . Patients exist symptom psychosis clinician rat 5-point Likert scale . Other secondary assessment include : Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) risperidone acceptability , complete patient caregiver ( applicable ) . For subject , VAS score calculate 10 cm line range score `` 0 '' ( acceptable ) `` 10 '' ( acceptable ) . Safety evaluation study include vital sign physical examination , body weight , adverse event surveillance , urine pregnancy test females childbearing potential . The study hypothesis clinical effect maintain schizophrenia patient previously stabilize risperidone conventional tablet treat rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablet , risperidone rapidly dissolve tablet well tolerate . Subjects stable conventional risperidone tablet ( 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 4 mg/day ) least 2 week switch equivalent dose rapidly-dissolving risperidone tablet ( 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 4 mg/day ) .
