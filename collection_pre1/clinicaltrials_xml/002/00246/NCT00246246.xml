	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness long-acting injectable formulation risperidone stable bipolar patient randomly switch current add-on oral antipsychotic ( olanzapine , risperidone , quetiapine ) therapy long-acting injectable risperidone . The patient switch long-acting injectable risperidone compare patient continue oral antipsychotic treatment regimen</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Open-label Trial Long-acting Injectable Risperidone Versus Oral Antipsychotic Medication Patients With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , randomize study . Approximately 40 stable bipolar patient atypical antipsychotic ( olanzapine , risperidone , quetiapine ) plus adjunct bipolar treatment consist ( maximum two lithium , valproate lamotrigine , , applicable , one antidepressant ) randomize two arm . In one arm , 25 milligram long-acting injectable risperidone replace oral atypical antipsychotic adjunct therapy arm , patient continue current atypical antipsychotic therapy . Trial duration 6 month . In long-acting injectable risperidone arm , oral atypical antipsychotic continue ( supplementation ) 3 week first injection long-acting risperidone discontinue . Investigators , base upon patient 's response , may increase dose injectable risperidone 37.5 mg 6 week 25-mg dose 50 mg least 4 week 37.5-mg dose . Risperidone oral supplementation allow . In oral antipsychotic arm , oral atypical antipsychotic dose also increase require . The primary efficacy outcome measure change Clinical Global Impression - Severity Illness subscale ( CGI-S ) , baseline endpoint , compare treatment group . Safety monitor throughout study . The primary hypothesis patient switch long-acting injectable risperidone able tolerate formulation risperidone maintain even improve reduction bipolar symptomatology compare baseline , compare subject continue oral antipsychotic arm . The secondary hypothesis patient switch long-acting injectable risperidone long time intervention mood episode ( either mania depression ) compare subject continue oral antipsychotic arm . Risperidone , formulate intramuscular injection , 25 mg every 2 week . Patients treat injectable risperidone continue original oral atypical antipsychotic ( AAP ) dose 3 week . Investigators , discretion , may increase dose injectable risperidone 37.5 mg 6 week 25-mg dose 50 mg least 4 week 37.5-mg dose . Study duration 6 month .</detailed_description>
