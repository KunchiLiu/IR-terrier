The maximum dose level CONCERTA® 54 mg placebo ( 3 tablet ) . Following titration , 5 week treatment . The primary efficacy outcome change total Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) score two group baseline final visit . MADRS clinician-rated scale consist 10 item design assess range depressive symptom . Safety tolerability study drug base adverse event clinical laboratory test , ECG , vital sign physical examination . The study hypothesis CONCERTA® add antidepressant therapy , rapid , tolerable overall improvement symptom depression , measure total Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Score ( MADRS ) . Subjects randomize once-daily start dose 18mg CONCERTA® 1 tablet placebo take orally . Provided patient tolerate study medication , titrate weekly . There 3 week titration one dose reduction allow . The maximum dose level 54 mg per day ( 3 tablet ) . By week 4 week 5 , subject optimal dose . Following titration , 5 week treatment .</detailed_description>
