	<brief_summary>This study determine biochemical genetic cause inherit immune disease affect lymphocyte homeostasis . Lymphocytes type white blood cell fight infection . Normally , body keep precise balance lymphocyte growth match lymphocyte death . People constantly enlarge lymph node spleen , along autoimmune disease , immunodeficiency , lymphoma , immune problem affect lymphocyte may abnormality immune system cell growth cell death process regulate lymphocyte homeostasis . Patients , suspect , inherit lymphocyte homeostasis program cell death susceptibility syndrome may eligible study . Relatives patient also include . Participants ' ( patient relatives ) medical record review blood sample draw study identify gene involve immune disorder . Tissues remove patient medical reason , biopsied tissue , may examine tissue DNA study . Relatives study determine may mild form lymphocyte homeostasis disorder . Patients immune problem researcher wish study invite donate additional blood sample irregular interval ( least year ) provide update medical record time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol design screen patient suspect identified genetic disease lymphocyte homeostasis , reflect abnormality program cell death , survival , activation , and/or proliferation . Patients determine clinical history initial outside evaluation refer physician interest consent enrol study . Blood specimens patient family member obtain research study relate understanding genetic biochemical base disease . Outside medical record obtain chart review correlate clinical history research laboratory test result . Results relay refer physician applicable patient refer appropriate NIH protocol additional clinical evaluation treatment . The study enroll 1000 patient family member next 5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients know suspected inherited lymphocyte homeostasis program cell death susceptibility syndrome eligible enrollment . In latter case , intensive time labor require research laboratory testing , patient enrol opinion investigator high index suspicion . Blood relative enrol patient eligible enrollment . There limit age , sex , race disability . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The presence acquire abnormality , HIV , cytotoxic chemotherapy , malignancy may ground possible exclusion , opinion investigator , presence disease process interfered evaluation . Severely debilitate health status poor venous access may also preclude obtain adequate specimen analysis . Within limit maximal acceptable blood draw volume minimum requirement core laboratory test ( 9 ml blood V.A.2a b ) , cutoff weight infant permit protocol 3 kg .</criteria>
