	<brief_summary>This study use brain imaging map brain cell receptor chemical call GABA , chemical inhibits activity nerve cell . The study include patient succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency , SSADH ( disorder enzyme deficiency disrupts GABA metabolism ) , parent , healthy volunteer . SSADH deficiency cause various neurological neuromuscular problem , include mild severe mental retardation , delay acquisition skill require coordination mental physical activity ( psychomotor retardation ) , delays language speech development , symptom . Healthy volunteer 18-55 year age , patient SSADH 5 24 year age , parent patient 18-55 year age may eligible study . Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan follow : Magnetic resonance imaging MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . For procedure , subject lie table move scanner ( narrow metal cylinder surround magnetic field ) wear earplugs muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 45 90 minute . Participants may ask lie still 90 minute time . In addition standard MRI , participant may also new type MRI may detect brain abnormality regular MRI normal , diffusion tensor MRI magnetic resonance spectroscopy . There noticeable difference ordinary MRI scan . Positron Emission Tomography A catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein subject 's wrist . The subject lie table head place scanner . A mask , use help keep head still scanner , place head . The mask uncomfortable hole subject see . A radioactive compound call flumazenil inject vein . The scan take 90 minute . Some child need sedate PET MRI scan . In case , chloral hydrate , standard drug pediatric diagnostic procedure , use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To measure CNS GABA receptor GABA level patient succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase ( SSADH ) deficiency , severe pediatric neurotransmitter disease . Study Population : The study include child young adult patient disorder , well parent patient ( obligate heterozygote ) , adult normal volunteer . Design : natural history study use neuroimaging technique . We perform 11C-flumazenil PET scan , magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . We perform neurological examination obtain data clinical manifestation condition . Outcome measure : The outcome measure distribution CNS bind 11C-flumazenil , brain GABA level measure MRS , relation clinical manifestation motor , speech , language impairment , hypotonia , hyporreflexia , seizure . We expect show patient SSADH deficiency multifocal reduction FMZ binding increase brain GABA level similar pattern .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients Clinical characteristic consistent SSADH deficiency . Persistent 4hydroxybutyric aciduria ( gammahydroxybutyric aciduria ) Documented leucocyte extract succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase enzyme deficiency Englishspeaking ( ability understand English second language ) Patients may male female . Female patient child bear potential pregnancy test within 24 hour study ensure pregnant patient participate . During study , woman child bear potential must use reliable method birth control . Parents Parents affect patient , definition , heterozygous carrier mutation succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase gene . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Neither patient healthy volunteer may suffer mental physical illness would interfere participation . Neither patient healthy volunteer may pregnant nurse Neither patient healthy volunteer may use alcohol recreational drug study Patients require treatment drug know affect GABAergic system , include vigabatrin . Patients seizure activity 24 hour prior study .</criteria>
