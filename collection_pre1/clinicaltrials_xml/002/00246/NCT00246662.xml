	<brief_title>Safety Assessment Two Schedules Intravenous Infusions SNS-595 Treatment Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients assign 1 2 schedule ( A B ) cohorts least 3 patient receive vosaroxin ( SNS-595 ) intravenously ( IV ) 4 cycle : weekly ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 Schedule A ) twice weekly ( Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 Schedule B ) . Dose escalation proceed independently Schedule A ( 18 mg/m2 initially ) Schedule B ( 9 mg/m2 initially ) absence Dose-limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) base modify Fibonacci sequence . The incidence DLT Cycle 1 determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) allow treatment delay 14 day resolve clinically significant abnormal laboratory value relate treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAEs ) one dose reduction 25 % case . Patients stable disease , hematologic improvement , partial remission stable blast count experience clinical benefit opinion investigator eligible receive vosaroxin 4 additional cycle .</detailed_description>
