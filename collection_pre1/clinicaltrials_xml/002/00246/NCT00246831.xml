	<brief_summary>This study examine people consider action control . The term describe feel control one 's action call `` agency . '' The sense agency becomes impaired disorder schizophrenia , people may feel , example , someone else control thought . Healthy , right-handed normal volunteer 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , neurological examination , pregnancy test woman childbearing age , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . During procedure , subject lie table slide scanner ( metal cylinder surround magnetic field ) may ask lie still 30 minute time . Participants undergo functional MRI ( fMRI ) . This procedure regular MRI , except do subject performs task . This enable researcher learn change brain region involve task . The fMRI scan study take 90 minute . Before begin fMRI procedure , subject receive train use Cyber glove device . This device allow researcher measure subject 's finger movement display screen subject view . The subject ask make hand movement slowly open close hand watch computer display artificial hand . During movement , subject ' level control adjust ask describe much control think hand screen . When subject become comfortable use Cyber glove , enter MRI scanner begin test scan . For fMRI , subject give visual instruction begin open close right hand . They move continuously 30-second block 20-second rest period . This repeat , subject provide different level control display hand block . The entire test consist four run , run consist 12 block last 10 minute . When fMRI scanning finish , brain scan use regular MRI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The purpose study identify structural brain region , use block design blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging ( BOLD-fMRI ) , differentially activate base sense self-agency felt make simple finger movement . We compare activation healthy volunteer patient diagnose functional movement disorder ( FMD ) hypothesize impaired sense volition . STUDY POPULATION : We intend use 25 right-hand dominant , adult healthy volunteer comparison 50 patient diagnosed FMD . We also wish study additinal 5 patient witha complete near-complete sensory neuropathy . DESIGN : The sense self-agency ( SA ) modulate use visual task-based stimulus ask subject manipulate position artificial hand project onto display magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanner . Subjects use right hand make slow sequential finger movement represent visually aid Cyberglove . During behavioral training phase , subject practice use apparatus . The level control randomly change one five state : 100 % control , 75 % , 50 % , 25 % , random/no control . After subject comfortable apparatus endorse SA display hand , undergo fMRI scan . FMD patient wish participate fMRI portion study may still participate behavioral test portion . The imaging phase experiment five set 6 minute scan session subject instruct slowly open close sequential finger right hand . The level control change pseudo-randomly throughout scan session . A control contrast consist subject observe move hand also integrated block . An additional control contrast involve subject move hand without visual feedback also include . These contrast serve analysis phase help eliminate hemodynamic activity relate visual-motor feedback . At completion fMRI scanning , baseline high-resolution MRI T1 scan obtain anatomic localization co-registration . At completion image portion , subject also ask report percentage control subjectively feel displayed hand use final data set behavioral testing . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome study difference activation brain structure response loss SA FMD patient , sensory neuropathy patient , healthy control . In particular , interested presence differential activation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , insula , inferior parietal lobe , pre-supplementary motor association cortex ( pre-SMA ) , and/or anterior cingulate may occur SA increase decrease . A secondary analysis utilize individual subject perception percent control behavioral training phase regressors activation rather objective control setting .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects age 18 old . Subjects must righthand dominant ( For healthy control ) . Patients diagnose probable definite functional movement disorder HMCS physician diagnose complete nearcomplete sensory neuropathy . Subjects willing abstain caffeine alcohol 48 hour prior fMRI scan . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects abnormal finding neurological exam . Subjects positive urine pregnancy test . Subjects pregnant . Subjects find MRI safety questionnaire prevents safely undergo MRI scan . Subjects metallic dental filling likely cause MRI artifacts . Subjects history brain tumor , stroke , head trauma vascular malformation obtain history image study . Subjects history severe medical condition , cardiovascular disease , would prevent lie flat 120 minute . Subjects without capacity give inform consent . Subjects claustrophobia restriction prevent undergoing scan confine space 60 minute . Patients excessive movement rest . Patients symptom remission .</criteria>
