	<detailed_description>We hypothesize infertile couple female partner 38-43 year age demonstrate adequate ovarian reserve high pregnancy rate cost immediate IVF would infertility treatment IVF precede either two cycle clomiphene IUI two cycle FSH IUI . This hypothesis test conduct randomized clinical trial couple female partner 38th 43rd birthday determine normal ovarian reserve CCT , would otherwise candidate ovulation induction/IUI initial treatment . The trial evaluate efficacy , cost cost-effectiveness three alternative infertility treatment strategy : ( 1 ) two cycle clomiphene/IUI follow IVF , ( 2 ) two cycle FSH/IUI follow IVF , ( 3 ) immediate IVF ; IVF treatment include maximum four fresh cycle IVF two thaw cycle . The trial follow specific aim : Aim 1 : To compare proportion woman clinically recognize intrauterine pregnancy two cycle treatment clomiphene/IUI , FSH/IUI , IVF . Aim 2 : To evaluate overall effectiveness three treatment strategy , associate complication . Aim 3 : To evaluate cost cost effectiveness three treatment strategy , include direct indirect medical cost . The study participant involve study vary amount time . The duration study determine treatment cycle participant become pregnant . It could short several month ' treatment plus duration pregnancy could long several year participant get pregnant take break treatment . This collaborative study Dartmouth College , Boston IVF , Brigham Women 's Hospital , Blue Cross Blue Shield Massachusetts , Harvard Pilgrim Health Care , Tufts Health Plan . Total expect enrollment : 450 Couples</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Female partner age 38th 43rd birthday time recruitment six month infertility . Male partner normal semen analysis show least 15 million total motile sperm/ejaculate least 1 % normal form strict criterion , least 5 million total motile sperm IUI prep . Patients must least one ovary least one ipsilateral patent fallopian tube confirm HSG laparoscopy . Pelvic pathology may present must amenable operative laparoscopy pelvis restore functional state , include surgically correct stage I II endometriosis . Patients stage III endometriosis qualify disease limit isolated endometrioma one ovaries remove pelvis restore functional state . For patient single patent fallopian tube , open tube previous ectopic ( tubal ) pregnancy , close tube hydrosalpinx ( tube block end fill fluid ) , unless cauterization perform junction uterus fallopian tube . Alternatively , tube could remove . 4 . Normal uterine cavity demonstrate HSG , sonohysterogram ( SHG ) , hysteroscopy ; pathology uterine cavity amenable operative hysteroscopy ( cavity restore normal demonstrate postoperative study ) . Regular menstrual cycle range 21 45 day ( patient occasional cycle , i.e . 1 2 /year , outside range acceptable ) . Acceptable ovarian reserve demonstrate patient clomiphene challenge test , i.e. , cycle day 3 FSH/E2 value &lt; 15 mIU/mL &lt; 100 pg/mL , respectively , cycle day 10 FSH &lt; 15 mIU/ml . ( Note : normal ovarian reserve represent FSH value less 1012 mIU/mL ; acceptable value represent transition zone . ) Normal TSH prolactin level . Informed consent partner . Female body mass index â‰¤ 38 . Previous tubal uterine cavity reconstructive surgery pelvis uterine cavity restore functional . Unilateral bilateral hydrosalpinx ( tube block end fill fluid ) cauterization perform junction uterus fallopian tube , previous removal fallopian tube ovary . A laparoscopy demonstrate pelvic adhesion stage I II endometriosis pelvis could restore normal surgery , endometriosis ablate excise . All patient stage IV endometriosis , stage III unless disease limit isolated endometrioma one ovaries remove pelvis restore functional state . One prior ectopic pregnancy affect tube render nonfunctional . One ectopic pregnancy exist single remain tube . Two ectopic pregnancy even tube patent . Severe male factor ( i.e . semen analysis meeting criterion list ) . Couples use donor semen exclude Previous treatment IUI IVF normal ovulatory patient gonadotropin . Inadequate ovarian reserve demonstrate FSH 15 mIU/mL high cycle day 3 10 estradiol 100 pg/mL high cycle day 3 . Anovulatory patient whose cycle routinely &lt; 21 day &gt; 45 day length . Patients require gamete intrafallopian tube transfer ( GIFT ) , zygote intrafallopian tube transfer ( ZIFT ) , tubal embryo transfer ( TET ) . BMI great 38 .</criteria>
