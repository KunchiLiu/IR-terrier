	<brief_title>The Boston Scientific ENOVUS Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine whether Boston Scientific ENOVUS AAA Endograft safe effective method treat AAA 's patient consider suitable candidate open surgical repair . The safety Boston Scientific ENOVUS AAA Endograft determine compare rate major morbidity Treatment Group rate major morbidity Control Group within 30 day initial procedure . The efficacy Boston Scientific ENOVUS AAA Endograft determine evaluate proportion patient Treatment Group free AAA rupture conversion open surgical repair within 1 year initial procedure . The secondary safety endpoint compare Treatment Control Groups : Mortality rate 30 day 1 year , AAA relate mortality 30 day 1 year . The secondary efficacy endpoint evaluate Treatment Group include : Technical success , enlargement AAA , migration , significant endoleak , loss device integrity . Secondary Clinical Utility endpoint compare Treatment Control group include : blood loss , duration procedure , ICU stay , length hospital stay , duration anesthesia .</detailed_description>
