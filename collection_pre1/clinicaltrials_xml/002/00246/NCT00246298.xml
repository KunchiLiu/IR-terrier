	<brief_title>A Study Assess Effectiveness PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Dosing Every 2 Weeks Versus Once Week Anemic HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment ( HAART ) era , anemia one common abnormalities HIV-infected subject . Epoetin alfa proven increase hemoglobin level improve quality life HIV-infected subject . Although data show epoetin alfa dose weekly significantly increase hemoglobin target level 13 g/dL every week dose maintain target hemoglobin , data show initiation epoetin alfa every 2 week increase hemoglobin level significantly . This randomized , two-arm , open-label study evaluate initiate PROCRIT® every week dose effective initiating PROCRIT® weekly dosing , increase hemoglobin anemic HIV-infected subject . The Screening phase start 2 week prior first dose PROCRIT® . HIV-infected subject hemoglobin level &lt; 12.0 g/dL stable antiretroviral regimen screen study eligibility . In treatment phase , subject randomized 1:1 ratio receive 40,000 IU PROCRIT® subcutaneous injection either weekly ( QW ) every week ( Q2W ) . The primary endpoint change hemoglobin baseline end study Week 12 . The safety tolerability PROCRIT® subject population assess evaluate adverse event , laboratory result vital sign . The total duration study 14 week , include 2-week screening phase 12-week treatment phase . The primary hypothesis mean increase hemoglobin subject receive PROCRIT® every 2 week low receive weekly PROCRIT® dose 1 g/dL . Subjects initially receive 40,000 IU PROCRIT® subcutaneous injection either weekly ( QW ) every week ( Q2W ) , subsequent dose adjustment , appropriate . The maximum length PROCRIT® treatment study 12 week .</detailed_description>
