	<brief_summary>Cardiac surgery major consumer blood product worldwide . The nature surgery heart-lung machine use , patient 's blood significantly dilute intravenous fluid . This dilution compound blood 's ability form blood clot seal wound , thus increase bleed surgery . The problem dilution particularly severe patient low body weight , large percentage woman undergo heart surgery . As result , population increase risk need blood transfusion surgery . The effect dilution potentially reverse filter blood remove fluid principal part procedure complete process refer modify ultrafiltration ( MUF ) . This procedure show effective several small clinical study , however interpretation result complicate fact study `` blind '' . In word , physician surgeon make decision blood transfusion know treatment patient receive ( i.e . MUF ) may bias judgement affect validity finding study . The investigator believe MUF may useful procedure limit blood transfusion , particularly patient low body size , weight undergoing heart surgery . This demonstrate large clinical trial , best case scenario , trial total blinding undertaken . However , blind manner quite difficult achieve necessary first demonstrate possible . Further , trial involve several heart center , essential demonstrate relatively complex study intervention carry center reproducible manner . With data hand , investigator able submit funding later date large trial determine MUF decrease need blood transfusion heart surgery patient . The investigator also able determine effect term help conserve blood benefit blood-banking agency ( Canadian Blood Service ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Effect Blinding Trial Blood Filtration During Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The demographic cardiac surgery population progressively change great proportion old patient female virtue co-morbidities small average size increase risk receive blood product surgery . Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) major contribute factor adverse event , technique associate coagulation platelet abnormality , also necessity , significant hemodilution consequence pump prime cardioplegia solution use induce cardiac arrest . The hemodilution resultant decrease hematocrit ( Hct ) may trigger transfusion surgical team evidence platelet coagulation function may compromise , result worsen postoperative bleeding . Modified ultrafiltration ( MUF ) , technique commonly utilized pediatric cardiac surgery reverse effect hemodilution CPB , utilize circuit inflow attach aortic cannula , ultrafiltration device , outflow hemoconcentrated product direct back right atrium . Although MUF demonstrate effective increase Hct , technique receive general acceptance blood conservation technology adult cardiac surgery population several reason . First , necessary prolongation operative time MUF may perceive inconvenient operate staff may dissuade use technique . Second , result limit adult trial utilize MUF , though positive term blood conservation , show change magnitude would routinely impact standard care . It possible perceive benefit MUF trial less impressive primarily due inclusion patient low risk bleed lack blinding , thus contribute concern treatment bias . Finally , none trial blind thus treatment bias may contribute result . We believe ultimately use MUF target population must test double-blind randomize control trial . However , logistics carry trial magnitude must establish beforehand pilot trial convincingly demonstrate feasibility blind operative intervention , well reproducibility model several clinical center . We propose carry two phase multi-centre ( University Ottawa Heart Institute [ OHI ] , Kingston General Hospital , Royal Victoria Hospital , University Hospital London ) randomize control trial evaluate feasibility experimental model test MUF versus `` sham '' circuit low-body weight ( = 65 kg ) patient high risk receive transfusion . In Phase I ( n = 16 patient - 4 patients/center ) , model optimize , Phase II ( n = 64 patient - 16 patients/center ) project expand blinding test . The primary outcome involve success blind treat physician ( surgeon , anesthetist , intensivist ) Phase II measure novel Blinding Index . The information derive study model use support proposal subsequent definitive multi-center trial seek funding follow year ( n = 278/group ) . The primary outcome definitive trial address mean number unit blood transfused patient treat without MUF . There also evidence animal model benefit MUF limit neurologic injury relate cardiac surgery . This aspect assess clinical model therefore intend address evaluate impact MUF early late neurocognitive dysfunction relate CPB secondary outcome definitive trial . The propose pilot definitive trial potential address role MUF adult cardiac surgery blood conservation technology . The potential application significant implication procedure inexpensive , easily teachable physiologically sound . Further , considerable relevance woman undergo heart surgery due relative small body weight increased current transfusion risk . As , believe magnitude finding trial greatly impact current care cardiac surgery worldwide .</detailed_description>
