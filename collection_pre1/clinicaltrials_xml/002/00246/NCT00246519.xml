	<brief_summary>There many medication available treatment high blood pressure ( hypertension ) , find right one specific patient challenging . In fact , estimate 34 % people hypertension blood pressure control . The hypothesis genetic difference individual influence response antihypertensive medication . This study aim determining genetic factor may influence person 's response either beta-blocker thiazide diuretic . The hope research , may someday able use individual 's genetic information guide selection blood pressure medicine , lead good control blood pressure , less need current trial error process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose work help move toward long-term goal selection antihypertensive drug therapy base patient 's genetic make-up . Hypertension ( HTN ) common chronic disease drug prescribe , prevalent risk factor heart attack , stroke , renal failure heart failure . Responses antihypertensive drug therapy exhibit considerable interpatient variability , contribute poor rate HTN control ( currently 34 % US ) , frequent nonadherence dropout therapy . We propose identify genetic predictor antihypertensive adverse metabolic response two prefer pharmacodynamically contrast drug , beta-blocker ( atenolol ) thiazide diuretic ( hydrochlorothiazide ) give initially monotherapy , subsequently combination , 800 individual uncomplicated hypertension . High quality phenotype data , include home ambulatory measure blood pressure ( BP ) response , lipid insulin sensitivity measure adverse metabolic response relate genetic variation two approach . First , test 7 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) 70 candidate gene , examine influence gene ' variation response beta-blockers diuretic ( Specific Aim 1 ) . This include assessment genetic association : antihypertensive response monotherapy ( Aim 1a ) , addition second drug monotherapy ( Aim 1b ) , combination therapy ( Aim 1c ) ; adverse metabolic response mono combination therapy ( Aim 1d ) . This candidate gene approach supplement discovery novel gene involve variable BP metabolic response beta-blockers diuretic test 20,000 putative functional SNPs span human genome ( Specific Aim 2 ) . As Aim 1 , Aim 2 include test association antihypertensive adverse metabolic response monotherapy combination therapy . The propose research substantially increase understand pharmacogenetics mono- combination antihypertensive drug therapy . It also lead creation data set sample use others field , deposit data PharmGKB , creation immortalize cell line study participant share data biological sample researcher . The propose research significant genetically-targeted antihypertensive therapy could lead dramatically high response rate fewer adverse effect usual trial-and-error approach . This would likely lead high rate HTN control , less need polypharmacy , reduce health care cost , improve outcome .</detailed_description>
