	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect NHLBI 's employee exercise program , Keep Beat , blood vessel function . Damage blood vessel cause narrow vessel , result reduce blood flow part body heart . Stem cell call endothelial progenitor cell , EPCs , may able heal blood vessel damage . Exercise , walk treadmill , help move EPCs bone marrow originate blood stream help heal damage blood vessel . The Keep Beat program encourages NHLBI employee exercise 15 minute workday provide exercise facility accomplish . NHLBI employee access NIH exercise facility may eligible study . Candidates must history heart disease , must currently exercise 1.5 hour per week must participate Keep Beat program 3 month prior enter study . They screen blood test blood pressure measurement . Participants undergo follow test procedure begin study 3 month participate Keep Beat : - Blood test identify EPCs function , measure level nitric oxide ( gas produce healthy blood vessel ) , measure C-reactive protein ( inflammatory marker may risk factor cardiovascular disease ) . - Brachial artery reactivity study measure well arteries widen . An ultrasound device place subject 's artery elbow . The device measure size artery flow blood pressure cuff inflate around forearm . - Treadmill exercise test evaluate physical fitness . Subjects exercise treadmill long . An exercise specialist present throughout test . Heart rhythm oxygen saturation monitor continuously blood pressure measure every 3 minute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Regular Exercise Vascular Function Cardiovascular Risk Sedentary Work Force</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence suggest Americans become increasingly sedentary work home due technological advance . Physical inactivity couple excess caloric intake , especially calorie-rich fast food , responsible epidemic obesity country . Physical inactivity obese non-obese individual increase risk cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality . Premature cardiovascular disease lead lose productivity work place , impair quality life , escalate health care cost . In response concern , American Heart Association advocate 30 minute aerobic exercise day ; however , busy schedule couple lack convenient access exercise equipment ( motivation use ) limit adoption regular exercise many . One year ago , National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) initiate Keep Beat program encourages Institute employee engage fifteen minute exercise work day , provide exercise equipment specific work site accomplish goal . Yet , few 10 % NHLBI employee regularly participate Keep Beat many initially enrol failed continue participation . The purpose prospective cohort study determine whether participation Keep Beat program improve important measure cardiovascular risk-arterial endothelial function-by stimulate bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell repair endothelium . We propose characterize important component vascular health measure endothelial nitric oxide bioactivity , determine brachial artery reactivity shear stress nitric oxide metabolite blood , vascular repair potential , determine endothelial progenitor cell number function , baseline 3 month National Institutes Health employee agree participate Keep Beat . Secondary analysis include biomarkers risk , C-reactive protein , blood pressure , body mass index , lipid profile , fast glucose/insulin , homeostasis model assessment index , measure study subgroup analyse participant particularly high cardiovascular risk ( great 20 % 10 year ) , minority , woman . Demonstration improve vascular function , implication reduce cardiovascular risk , may serve incentive great employee participation establish employer-initiated program , adoption similar program employer . If objective benefit demonstrate vascular function biomarkers risk , modification program may require reduce cardiovascular risk .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Employees NHLBI currently participate Keep Beat program ( may include employee previously register Keep Beat program , participate past 3 month ) NIH employee use excercise room Building 10 , Building 31 , Rockledge II . No medical condition might prohibit safe participation Keep Beat program . Subject understands protocol provide write , informed consent addition willingness comply specify followup evaluation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Heart disease indicate history myocardial infarction , document disease coronary angiography , coronary artery stent placement , congestive heart failure , significant structural heart disease ( e.g . hypertrophic dilate cardiomyopathy , valvular heart disease ) , positive treadmill exercise test baseline . Baseline blood pressure systolic great 140 mmHg diastolic great 90 mmHg 2 measure without hypertensive medication . Subjects encourage seek evaluation primary care provider . Baseline fast blood glucose great 126 mg/dl , subject previously undiagnosed diabetic . Subjects encourage seek evaluation primary care provider . Baseline fast LDL great 190 mg/dl . Subjects encourage seek evaluation primary care provider . Physically unable perform Keep Beat program due neurologic orthopedic condition . Pregnant woman exclude due large hormonal change pregnancy affect study variables potential pregnancyrelated restriction exercise . Subjects currently exercise 1.5 hour per week include brisk walking , sport activity ( basketball ) , deliberate exercise . Subjects may currently participate participate course study another study protocol include blood draw intervention .</criteria>
