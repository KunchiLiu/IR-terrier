	<detailed_description>Plague infection occur small rodent mammal cause gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis ( Y. pestis ) . Transmission rodent man usually flea vector lead characteristic swell lymph node drain region bite , follow septicaemic illness ( classic bubonic plague ) . Human-to-human transmission occur via droplet nucleus spread cough patient bubonic septicaemic plague develop pulmonary lesion ( pneumonic plague ) . However , case pulmonary transmission also describe household pet . In pneumonic plague symptom respiratory infection develop first follow acute onset septicaemic illness . In military context , likely exposure via inhalation route , Biological Warfare Agent ( BWA ) , therefore protection pneumonic plague paramount requirement . This phase 1 , parallel group , single-blind study 105 healthy adult age 18-55 , randomly assign one three cohort receive dose vaccine ( 2x ) re-randomized 6 month receive either third dose placebo , order determine safety tolerability associate different primary immunization dose recombinant IM plague vaccine ( rF1 rV ) antigen protein optimum safe dose , assess response ( antibody cell-mediated ) follow immunization , investigate correlation cell-mediated antibody titer assess duration immune response antigens follow third dose .</detailed_description>
