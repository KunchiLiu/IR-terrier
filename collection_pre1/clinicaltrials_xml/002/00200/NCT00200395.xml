	<brief_title>Phs . II Study OSI-774 ( Erlotinib , Tarceva ) Elderly Patients W/Advanced Stage Inoperable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , show degree improvement achievable chemotherapy plateaued use chemotherapy doublet . The presence co-morbid condition poor performance status may preclude use chemotherapy many elderly patient , even medically fit , modest benefit . The advent target cancer therapy discovery tyrosine kinases mediator tumor growth , limited toxicity profile , offer promising approach treatment NSCLC , particular elderly subset patient . The encouraging result trial provide strong rationale evaluate oral EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor OSI-774 patient advance inoperable NSCLC age 70 . In vitro clinical data suggest dose- dependent response Tarceva ( Genentech , data file ) .</detailed_description>
