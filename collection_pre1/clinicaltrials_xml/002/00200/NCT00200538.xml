	<brief_title>Efficacy Tolerability Memantine Frontotemporal Dementia ( FTD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) first cause dementia presenium ( onset age 65 year ) . Characterized behavioral disorder , often incapacitate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , lead death within 7 year average ( 9-10 year AD ) . It affect young individual ( average , 20 year young AD ) , often still active . Management patient therefore burdensome complex . As opposed AD , however , treatment currently available . Few therapeutic trial actually conduct disorder . Many reason may account : 1. recent availability reliable diagnostic criterion ( Lund Manchester group ' consensus statement 1994 ; revise 1998 ) , 2. small number case oppose AD―the number case estimate approximately 3,500 v 600,000 , AD , France 2004― , FTD therefore fall category rare disease ( i.e. , less 30,000 case ) , 3. scarcity valuable physiopathological hypothesis . Besides non-specific serotoninergic dysfunction , significant anomaly relate particular neuromediators apparently find ( opposed AD , characterize cholinergic deficit ) . In 1998 , discovery mutation Tau gene certain kindred show dominant autosomal transmission FTD , orient research effort toward tau protein provide new perspective . Many study suggest role excitotoxicity . Abnormal aggregation tau protein observe brain majority FTD patient ( familial sporadic form ) . Excitotoxicity may responsible promote abnormal aggregation modification expression phosphorylation state tau protein . The hypothesis study anti-excitotoxic neuroprotective treatment may slow pathogenic process therefore effective treatment pathology . Goals : To assess efficacy tolerability memantine ( anti-excitotoxic , neuroprotective treatment currently use AD ) FTD patient one-year treatment . Type study : National , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled , phase II therapeutic trial . Study design : Sixty four ( 64 ) patient , age 45 75 year , enrol study period 12 month ( clinical inclusion criterion define base Lund Manchester group consensus statement [ revise version 1998 ] ) , follow 1 year control study . At time inclusion , Mini Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) score least 19 ( 18 , neuropsychological examination impossible ) . Patients either take memantine , placebo ( randomization ratio 1:1 ) twice day ( i.e. , 20 mg memantine per day memantine arm ) . The primary efficacy variable global assessment tool , CIBIC-Plus ( Clinician 's Interview-Based Impression Change Plus Caregiver Input ) . Secondary efficacy variable include behavioral scale [ NeuroPsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) , Frontal Behavior Inventory ( FBI ) ] , cognitive scale [ Mattis Dementia Rating Scale ( MDRS ) , MMSE ] , activity daily live ( Disability Assessment Dementia , DAD ) , time spend caregiver patient ( Resource Utilization Dementia , RUD ) , caregiver burden scale ( Zarit Burden Inventory ) , tolerability drug . The main analysis carry intention-to-treat basis randomize patient undergone least one evaluation inclusion ( Last Observation Carried Forward LOCF value , attribute miss value ) . This analysis carry end double-blind study ( main judgement criterion ) Expected result perspective : The main expected result confirmation efficacy memantine treatment FTD , would set precedent treatment disease . Such result could also lead way development treatment related neurodegenerative disorder ( tauopathies ) frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( semantic dementia , progressive non-fluent aphasia ) , progressive supranuclear palsy , corticobasal degeneration . Finally , standardize follow-up 64 patient cohort study provide important information natural history rare poorly-known disease .</detailed_description>
