	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux disease frequent disease heavily affect patient ' quality life . To alleviate symptom ease heal lesion , patient often need continuously take anti-secretory drug ( Proton pump inhibitor PPIs ) , , despite efficiency , cure disease . For PPI dependent patient , anti-reflux surgery ( fundoplication often make coelioscopy ) possible alternative significant morbidity rate even estimate post-operative mortality 0.8 % outside expertise centre . Therefore , new therapeutic endoscopic approach , suppose less invasive less expensive surgery develop last three year . Among , radiofrequency ( Stretta® procedure ) consist administer high frequency current cardia area , order induce thanks thermal effect sub-mucous remodelling modification compliance cardia regionThe aim project carry 8 French centre 2 European center assess randomise trial , efficiency radiofrequency PPI dependent patient . The study carry 2 phase patient fully inform project statement , particularly potential risk radiofrequency technique give write acceptation participate study.The first phase , last 6 11 week , aim make sure patient PPI dependent define need . After initial phase , patient randomise carry PPI treatment radiofrequency treatment . The follow randomisation last one year . The first assessment therapeutic efficiency do 6th month . The 6 additional follow month require assessment mid-term side effect treatment rate symptomatic recurrence .</brief_summary>
