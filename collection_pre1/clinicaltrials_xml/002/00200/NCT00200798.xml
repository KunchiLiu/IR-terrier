	<detailed_description>BIOAVAILABILTY STUDY : 1 . Clinical Protocol Screening/Informed Consent : Sixteen subject recruit clinical protocol . All protocol , consent form , HIPAA form shall IRB-approved prior initiate study procedure recruitment . At screening/informed consent visit , study design , purpose inclusion/exclusion criterion explain prospective subject . Written inform consent obtain prior commence study procedure . After informed consent obtain , medical examination perform along baseline serum chemistry , complete blood count , electrocardiogram , urinalysis , urine drug screen , nicotine/cotinine , urine pregnancy test ( female ) . Subjects ask diet include alcohol use use herbal medications/dietary supplement . If potential subject consume herbal dietary supplement two-week period abstinence supplement use necessary beginning study . Additionally , subject refrain use honey propolis-containing product ( due presence chrysin potential assay interference ) , artichoke , artichoke-containing food also contain taxifolin ( constituent find MT ) . Single- Multiple-Dose Silymarin Pharmacokinetics : Subjects arrive MUSC GCRC morning remain approximately 10-hours 4 separate blood draw phase study . After check , medical supervision , modification modify Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale ( TESS ) administer registered nurse place indwell venous catheter subject 's arm facilitate serial blood sampling . At 8 AM urinary void collection aliquot creatinine analysis , subject take one 175 mg capsule MT standardize 80 % SM ( 140 mg SM ) . The rationale product choice discuss . Subjects fast state 4 hour follow MT administration reduce effect food absorption . A total 12 blood sample ( 10 ml ) take next 24-hour period . All sample draw heparinized tube store ice centrifugation 4°C . As flavonoid notorious instability biological matrix , sample remain ice long 15 minute prior centrifugation . Time point blood collection immediately prior dose MT ( 0 time point ) , 0.5 hour , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 6.0 , 8.0 , 12 , 24 hour . A second TESS administer subject 2 hour post-dosing , time generally expect represent silybin Cmax . Subjects ask return 4 brief visit collection single blood sample separate venipuncture time point 24 , 36 , 48 hour . This extend sample provide adequate PK data determine Cmax , AUC , terminal t1/2 , Clo SM flavonoid . Standard meal serve registered dietician GCRC include source flavonoid . The composition amount food eaten throughout day record . Plasma acidify 10 ml 1M acetic acid/ml plasma freeze immediately -70°C . This single dose assessment silymarin pharmacokinetics conduct three dosage level MT supplement attempt span usual therapeutic range MT perform three distinct occasion separate less 7-day wash-out period . The dos MT use 175 mg , 350 mg 525 mg administer orally 200 mL water one , two , three capsule , respectively . Again , dose well product could change standardized supplement make available NIH/NCCAM source . The high dose MT supplement propose oral administration , 525 mg ( 420 mg SM ) pose undue risk subject since SM dose 420 mg 800 mg administer many patient hepatic dysfunction clinical trial side effect report ( NLM , 2000 ; Saller et al. , 2001 ) . Following last single dose assessment ensue 7-day minimum wash-out period , subject initiate treatment 28-day treatment exposure MT supplement 175 mg ( 140 mg SM ) generally recommend clinically study dosage one capsule thrice daily ( NLM , 2000 ) . A 28-day course select assure steady-state reach surpass duration publish pharmacokinetic study SM human subject generally brief duration . In addition , extend dose assessment allow gather pilot data antioxidant potential SM via measurement urinary isoprostanes . Finally , assessment treatment-emergent adverse effect tolerability make . Subjects report outpatient GCRC 4 separate occasion pick 7-day supply SM time TESS administer . At initial visit GCRC obtain first week 's supply MT , subject provide urine sample baseline measurement urinary isoprostanes creatinine . After 28 day treatment subject report GCRC determination steady-state concentration SMs plasma urine . A blood draw perform immediately prior dose MT ( Ctrough ) 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 4.0 8.0 follow MT dose . Based upon available publish data , timepoints sufficient capture ( Cmax ) flavonoids interest despite interindividual variability . Additionally , subject provide morning urine sample analysis urinary isoprostane creatinine . Follow-Up : Subjects return 7 day follow final blood draw follow-up serum chemistry complete blood count ( CBC ) perform provide additional assurance subject safety . We also perform final assessment adverse event use TESS scale . DRUG INTERACTION ASSESSMENT : 1 . Clinical Protocol Drug Interaction Assessment An outline propose clinical study determine drug interaction potential silymarin Assessing Cytochrome P450 Activity vivo Probe Drugs Probe substrate compound major CYP enzymes available assess genetic , environmental , ethnic difference enzyme activity . In last 2 year research group publish 7 full research report utilize probe drug methodology assess botanical-drug interaction . These study likewise funded NCCAM , excellent safety record , perform within MUSC GCRC . Probe compound initially administer subject absence suspect enzyme inhibitor inducer parent drug drug : metabolite ratio measure plasma urine reflect enzyme activity . This assessment repeat presence suspect inhibitor inducer comparison make . In manner , specific enzyme inhibitory inductive effect elucidate , document , generalize similar substrate . In study , use select probe substrate alprazolam ( CYP3A4 ) , dextromethorphan ( CYP2D6 ) , tolbutamide ( [ TOL ] CYP2C9 ) caffeine ( CYP1A2 ) , assess ability MT/SM selectively alter one major drug metabolize enzyme responsible metabolism &gt; 80 % therapeutically use drug . We propose use validate widely accept method evaluate drug-interaction potential characterize MT supplement . A clinical protocol , use 16 normal volunteer , evaluate potential inhibit induce CYP3A4 , CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , potential inhibit CYP2D6 ( non-inducible isoform ) . Test dose four safe probe drug administer baseline ( treatment MT ) 14-day treatment period . Changes pharmacokinetics probe drug indicate degree specific enzyme inhibition induction , respectively . These data use evaluate effect combine standardized MT supplement drug substrates CYP enzymes study . Screening/Informed Consent : Sixteen subject recruit clinical protocol replacement recruit necessary 16 subject complete protocol . Screening separate inform consent process take place pharmacokinetic study previously describe following exception : Subjects genotyped determine poor metabolizers CYP2D6 substrate . Subjects also ask adverse event accord Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale ( [ TESS ] Zhang et al. , 2001 ) determine symptom present prior administration MT supplement . Subjects ask diet include alcohol use use herbal medications/dietary supplement . If potential subject consume herbal dietary supplement two week period abstinence supplement use necessary begin next study phase . Baseline CYP profile : Subjects return GCRC specify time morning prior probe drug administration . In morning , indwell venous catheter place subject 's arm facilitate serial blood sampling . At 8AM , urinary void , subject ask take simultaneous single oral dos 2 mg ALPZ , 100 mg CAF , 100 mg TOL , 30 mg DM . At time , urine collection commence first eight hour visit . A total 11 blood sample ( 10 ml ) take 12-hour period . Time point blood collection immediately drug administration , 0.5 hour , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 6.0 , 8.0 , 12 hour . Additionally , subject ask return 4 brief visit collection single blood sample separate venipuncture time point 24 , 36 , 48 hour . This extend sample provide adequate pharmacokinetic data determine Cmax , AUC , terminal t1/2 , Clo probe drug . To reduce potential variability drug absorption due food , subject fast state 4 hour follow probe drug administration . Standard meal serve registered dietician GCRC include grapefruit , artichoke product , CAF . The composition amount food eaten throughout day record . MT Treatment Period : Subjects commence treatment MT supplement 175 mg ( 140 mg SM ) one capsule three time daily ( 8AM , 12 noon , 8PM ) period 14 day . Subjects supply pre-loaded medication organizer contain daily dos MT promote compliance regimen . Subjects ask return study site 4 pre-scheduled appointment time capsule count , discus compliance dietary restriction , monitor adverse event . Post-MT CYP profile : Subjects return GCRC phase study . Subjects check morning prior repeat dose probe medication . The profiling CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 CYP1A2 perform exactly describe baseline phase exception first 24 hour subject continue previous schedule dose MT supplement . The dos probe drug coincide 8AM dose MT take concomitantly . Blood urine sample time identical . As baseline phase , subject fast state 4 hour follow probe drug administration . Additionally , subject serve identical meal timepoints baseline phase . Follow-Up : Subjects return 7 day follow final blood draw follow-up serum chemistry complete blood count ( CBC ) perform provide additional assurance subject safety . We also perform final assessment adverse event use TESS scale . Probe Drugs : Alprazolam ( ALPZ ) , dextromethorphan ( DM ) , tolbutamide ( TOL ) caffeine ( CAF )</detailed_description>
