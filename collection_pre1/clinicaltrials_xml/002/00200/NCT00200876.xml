	<brief_title>Effects Anticipation Pain Relief Brain Mechanisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence suggest expectation pain relief , even person receives placebo , provide actual therapeutic benefit . The µ-opioid receptor system , locate brain , activated anticipation pain relief ; activation suppress stress pain response . This study use brain image technology examine effect placebo intervention µ-opioid neurotransmitter . Examination factor regulate placebo-activated neurotransmitter response clarify overall neurobiology underlie variation response placebo , well pain stressful condition , ultimately lead optimization medical psychological intervention . This study last several hour one study visit . Participants receive painful painless injection undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) brain imaging . The painful injection consist small amount hypertoninc saline ( concentrated saline cause cell shrinkage ) jaw muscle 20-minute period . Several minute participant receive hypertonic saline , receive injection isotonic saline associate pain opposite jaw muscle . After participant receive injection , either tell tell pain relief intervention . PET image continue participant either anticipate anticipate pain relief . Participants ask pain level repeatedly throughout study ; response enter computer-controlled system modulate rate saline infusion .</detailed_description>
