	<brief_summary>With major liver pancreas operation , chance one require transfusion blood product ( either red blood cell plasma ) . This may necessary operation day surgery . The surgeon Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center perform large number liver pancreas resection every year pioneer technique minimize bleeding operation . Even , liver pancreas operation one undergone carry 50 % chance require transfusion . A technique might lower need transfusion call acute normovolemic hemodilution ( ANH ) . ANH first introduce twenty year ago use many type operation , include liver pancreas resection . The study do ANH hospital suggest may help conserve blood . Researchers Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center conduct study determine ANH well 'standard technique ' currently use patient . The purpose study find two technique well . The purpose study see ANH lower need transfusion blood product liver pancreas resection . The second purpose study see ANH change length operation , length time one spend hospital , complication rate surgery . The researcher also see ANH require change administration anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution Versus Standard Intraoperative Management Patients Having Hepatic Resection Pancreaticoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improvement peri-operative outcome , major hepatic resection pancreaticoduodenectomy remain associated high risk major blood loss perioperative blood transfusion.The risk associate allogeneic blood transfusion well-known , include immunosuppression , incompatible transfusion , transmission infectious agent . Clearly , effort reduce use allogeneic blood product warrant order avoid potential transfusion-related complication , reduce hospital cost avoid period critical blood shortage . ANH approach blood conservation involve removal whole blood patient immediately prior operation likely associate significant blood loss . Following blood removal , euvolemia restore crystalloid and/or colloid . The harvested blood , great red cell mass blood lose intraoperatively , re-infused needed procedure completion operation . ANH attractive preoperative autologous blood donation several reason : technically logistically much simpler , require special equipment cost less ( storage administrative cost ) , associate low chance administration error , require obligate pre-operative delay associate waste autologous unit . In addition , coagulation factor preserve later re-infused , ANH may reduce need post-operative fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) . Additionally , ANH may impact low CVP anesthetic management partial hepatectomy , standard MSKCC many center . The present study help elucidate efficacy ANH mean reduce allogeneic transfusion rate patient undergo major hepatic resection . If show effective reducing use allogeneic blood product , ANH impact current practice hepatic resectional surgery may also change current practice surgical discipline . This prospective randomized study . Eligible patient consent trial prior operation .</detailed_description>
