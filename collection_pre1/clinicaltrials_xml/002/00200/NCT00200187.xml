	<brief_summary>You ask join study early stage prostate cancer prostate remove . The purpose study compare blood loss surgery among two type anesthesia . One type general anesthesia . It put deep enough sleep feel anything . It also keep blood pressure low , might decrease bleed . The second type combine spinal-epidural anesthesia . For type , small catheter place spinal canal back . Anesthesia give catheter make body numb waist , sleep would deep . Your blood pressure would remain normal range . After surgery , catheter remain place treat pain , body would numb . When wake general anesthesia , would receive pain medicine vein arm . Both type use Memorial Hospital . They accept form anesthesia . We look blood loss two type patient prostate remove . We also want learn side effect anesthesia type , assess pain experience surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Efficacy Low Venous Pressure General Anesthesia Versus Combined Spinal-Epidural Anesthesia Decreasing Blood Loss During Prostate Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomize trial compare efficacy low venous pressure general anesthesia ( LVPGA ) technique vs. combine spinal-epidural anesthesia ( CSE ) decrease intraoperative blood loss patient undergo open radical retropubic prostatectomy ( RRP ) newly diagnose clinically localize adenocarcinoma prostate . The study design involve enrollment 246 patient schedule RRP . To control surgeon technique varibility intraoperative blood loss , study limit patient population two surgeon perform great 150 radical prostatectomy per year . Patients stratify surgeon randomize receive either LVPGA CSE . Preoperatively patient encourage donate autologous blood current practice MSKCC . Perioperative measurement management fluid administration , estimation blood loss urine output , transfusion criterion standardize anesthesia group . Transfusion blood product discretion attend surgeon anesthesiologist follow guideline describe protocol . Autologous blood routinely transfuse back hemoglobin &gt; = 8.0 patient symptomatic . Patients randomize CSE arm also receive postoperative epidural analgesia , patient randomize LVPGA receive intravenous PCA analgesia per current standard care . Pain relief assess standardized pain scale record PACU twice daily discharge . All patient receive routine preoperative evaluation , well routine intraoperative postoperative monitoring care . All patient place routine postoperative pathway . The MSKCC Morbidity/Mortality DMT Documentation System utilized document postoperative complication per routine practice . The Surgical Secondary Events ( SSE ) program design provide risk adjust postoperative morbidity mortality data institutional comparison decision support project , generate , report analyze event promote change improvement patient management . SSE group 6 grade depend severity complication treatment requirement : Grade 0 , event observe beyond 30 day postop . Grade 1 , use oral medication , bedside intervention treat event . Grade 2 , use I.V . medication , TPN , enteral nutrition , blood transfusion treat event . Grade 3 , interventional radiology , therapeutic endoscopy , intubation , angiography operation require treat event . Grade 4 , residual lasting disability require major rehabilitation organ resection . Grade 5 , event result death patient .</detailed_description>
