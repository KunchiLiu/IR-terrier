	<brief_summary>The objective study determine differential effect intervention delivery channel ( phone versus print versus wait list control ) physical activity adoption maintenance previously sedentary adult . Both delivery channel find effective , telephone-based intervention require commitment part subject labor intensive print-based intervention . Thus , conduct randomize controlled clinical trial compare three group : 1 ) telephone-based motivationally-tailored individualized feedback ; 2 ) print-based , motivationally-tailored individualized feedback ; 3 ) minimal contact wait list control condition ( receive intervention 12 month control ) . Two hundred twenty-eight healthy , sedentary woman men age 18-65 randomly assign one two intervention waiting-list control condition . Our primary hypothesis individual randomize either phone print condition exhibit significantly high level physical activity participation 6 12 month individual wait list control condition . And , addition , subject randomize telephone condition exhibit significantly high level physical activity participation 6 12 month print condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As many 60 % Americans engage regular physical activity 25 % completely inactive . The risk cardiovascular disease almost double among people physically inactive , comparable risk associate increase systolic blood pressure , cigarette smoking , elevate serum cholesterol . To make impact physical activity prevalence population level require research focus interface clinical efficacy trial large-scale dissemination study . Studies interface must use proven intervention simultaneously effective cost-efficient . Such intervention focus proposal . The objective study determine differential effect intervention delivery channel ( phone versus print versus wait list control ) physical activity adoption maintenance previously sedentary adult . Both delivery channel find effective , telephone-based intervention require commitment part subject labor intensive print-based intervention . Thus , conduct randomize controlled clinical trial compare three group : 1 ) telephone-based motivationally-tailored individualized feedback ; 2 ) print-based , motivationally-tailored individualized feedback ; 3 ) minimal contact wait list control condition ( receive intervention 12 month control ) . Two hundred twenty-eight healthy , sedentary woman men age 18-65 randomly assign one two intervention waiting-list control condition . The two intervention arm match respect frequency content contact . Data collect baseline , 6 , 12 month use well-established physical activity physical performance measure , well comprehensive set psychosocial questionnaire . Our primary hypothesis individual randomize either phone print condition exhibit significantly high level physical activity participation 6 12 month individual wait list control condition . And , addition , subject randomize telephone condition exhibit significantly high level physical activity participation 6 12 month print condition . Additional question interest include evaluation cost-effectiveness two intervention delivery approach , relation wait list control group examination potential moderator mediator intervention-physical activity relationship . This study contribute important information regard relative efficacy cost-effectiveness two intervention , utilized widespread public health dissemination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals age 18 65 year recruit study . Criteria study participation individual healthy underactive ( i.e. , participate moderate vigorous physical activity 90 minute less per week ) . Individuals exclude study body mass index ( BMI ) great 35 hypertension , heart disease kind abnormal electrocardiogram , stroke , chronic infectious disease , musculoskeletal problem would limit treadmill test impair ability exercise , asthma , emphysema , chronic bronchitis , serious medical condition might make exercise unsafe unwise . Other exclusion criterion schedule would make adherence unlikely ( frequent travel ) , plan move area within next year , pregnancy plan attempt pregnancy , selfreport three alcoholic drink per day 5 day per week , hospitalization psychiatric disorder within last 6 month , currently suicidal , bipolar , psychotic , currently use prescription medication might impair exercise performance tolerance , specifically beta blocker . Participants agree randomly assign condition read sign institutionally approve consent form question answer .</criteria>
