For ancillary study , 147 volunteer recruit 165 overweight obese woman participate Program Reduce Incontinence Diet Exercise ( PRIDE ) The Miriam Hospital . As part PRIDE , participant randomize 2-to-1 ratio either 6-month weight loss intervention usual care . Assessments food reinforcement , dietary intake , weight occur 0 6 month . Given intervention group change diet relative usual care group , hypothesize : 1 ) intervention group great increase reinforce value high- low-fat food usual care group 0 6 month ; 2 ) within intervention group , decrease frequency consumption high-fat food relate increase reinforce value high-fat food 0 6 month . These result lead novel line research , examine relationship food reinforcement weight loss maintenance , diet design promote change food reinforcement aid sustain dietary change weight loss .</brief_summary>
