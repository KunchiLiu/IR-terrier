	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Substantial evidence support favorable relationship cardiovascular fitness , physical activity cardiovascular health . In particular , well establish increase level physical activity result favorable improvement lipid carbohydrate metabolism . There also evidence increase physical activity cardiovascular fitness beneficial effect cardiovascular health independent effect specific cardiovascular risk factor . One hypothesis propose beneficial effect regular exercise human mediate peripheral mechanism , particular chronic adaptation skeletal muscle habitual exercise . The exercise exposure require achieve health benefit human poorly define mechanisms beneficial adaptation occur poorly understood . The study investigate peripheral biological mechanism chronic physical activity alters carbohydrate metabolism lipid metabolism , result improvement parameter cardiovascular health fitness human . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In clinical trial , Studies Targeted Risk Reduction Intervention Defined Exercise ( STRRIDE I ) , subject randomly assign one three grade exercise training regimens sedentary control group ask train , initial ramp period two month , six month give exercise intensity dose . Parameters reflect change carbohydrate lipid metabolism study integrative physiologic level measurable biological endpoint peripheral skeletal muscle ( e.g. , capillary surface area ) . It propose elucidation peripheral mechanism mediate favorable response carbohydrate lipid metabolism chronic physical activity would lead good understand health benefit confer physical activity cardiovascular fitness human point way toward good exercise recommendation client significant cardiovascular risk factor . The purpose study investigate peripheral biological mechanism chronic physical activity alter carbohydrate metabolism lipid metabolism , result improvement parameter cardiovascular health fitness human . The drive hypothesis health benefit derive habitual exercise primarily mediate adaptation occur skeletal muscle , probably related alteration expose capillary surface area skeletal muscle induce exercise training . The investigator use graded exercise regimens moderately obese human subject mild moderate lipid metabolic abnormality investigate whether induced alteration skeletal muscle fiber type , metabolic capacity capillary surface area account favorable alteration insulin sensitivity glucose metabolism , lipoprotein level lipid metabolism .</detailed_description>
