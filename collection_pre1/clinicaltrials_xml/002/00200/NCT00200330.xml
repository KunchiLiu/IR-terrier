	<brief_summary>The obesity epidemic observe recent year largely attribute obesogenic environment encourages overeat sedentary lifestyle . Behavioral weight control treatment , empirically validate intervention approach , produce initial weight loss 10 % ; however , maintenance initial weight loss behavior change achieve . These disappointing long-term result may reflect fact participant give minimal , indirect instruction change environment support new weight-regulating behavior . While theory , behavioral model emphasize environmental antecedent consequence eat exercise , practice , 1 2 session standard treatment dedicate stimulus control-types skill . By teach weight control skills contextual vacuum , participant remain vulnerable environmental influence maintain unhealthy eating exercise habit . Given majority eat exercise home-based , logical step strengthen behavioral treatment move toward ecological model behavior expand focus treatment individual individual plus home environment . We propose test long-term impact behavioral weight control program design directly modify physical social home environment weight loss participant . Two hundred overweight obese men woman randomly assign either 18 month standard behavioral treatment ( SBT ) 18 month standard behavioral treatment plus direct modification home environment ( SBT+Home ) . SBT+Home incorporate many strategy show promise improve weight loss ( e.g. , food exercise equipment provision , spouse involvement ) first study physical social factor within home simultaneously long examination home environment conduct date . Participants spouse assess baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 month . We hypothesize broaden focus treatment individual individual plus home environment , SBT+Home produce good long-term weight loss well maintenance initial weight loss behavior change . This home environmental approach , successful , potential application maintenance important health behavior .</brief_summary>
