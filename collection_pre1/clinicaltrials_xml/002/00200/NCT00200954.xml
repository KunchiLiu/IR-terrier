	<detailed_description>Background . Atopic diseases increase country Western lifestyle . The hygiene hypothesis state increase atopic disease could due reduce exposure microbial antigen early life . In search new preventive therapy atopic disease , exposure pregnant woman previous recent atopic disease , offspring probiotic suggest . Probiotics mono mixed culture microbe , apply animal man , beneficially affect host , among others induce immune response . Probiotics generally accept safe child . Probiotics show effective primary prevention atopic disease high-risk neonates one study far . However , still unclear mechanism probiotic work immunopotent ( combination ) probiotic ( ) . It likely antigen-presenting cell ( APC 's ) involve , since cell important first line defence gastrointestinal tract . It imagine immune response result interplay probiotic APC 's . In particular , match pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( PAMP 's ) probiotic counterparts APC 's , pathogen-recognition-receptors ( PRR 's ) ( like instance Toll-like receptor ) decisive aspect . Hypothesis . Administration probiotic pregnant woman offspring may reduce development sensitization well onset atopic disease offspring . Aim . To study effect probiotic sensitisation prevalence atopic disease , severity atopic disease , intestinal flora immune parameter high-risk newborn . Methods . To study hypothesis , randomise , double-blind placebo-controlled trial carry administration probiotic pregnant woman previous recent atopic disease well offspring . Primary outcome parameter firstly prevalence severity sensitization atopic disease offspring follow-up two year . Secondary outcome parameter change stool composition treatment probiotic in-vitro production cytokine PBMCs collect 3 month , 1 year 2 year age . Expected result . Perinatal administration probiotic pregnant woman offspring may hamper development sensitization atopic disease offspring . This may due modulation intestinal microbiota composition , modulation develop immune system</detailed_description>
