	<detailed_description>Previous research group use genetic microarray analysis HNSCC normal keratinocytes identify two distinct group genetic expression base cluster pattern subgroup gene . Clinical data summarize group overall , patient segregation gene expression profile good predictor outcome clinicopathological variable . Further analysis identify 375 gene discriminate genotypic subtypes HNSCC . Overall , preliminary data show pattern global gene expression HNSCC specimen use predictor prognosis . We isolate subset gene show great pattern divergence gene expression . We also identify 366 over-expressed 246 underexpressed gene compare primary tumor normal surgical margin identify similar number gene whose expression change compare primary tumor lymph node metastasis . Combining data set identify gene consistently increase decrease expression progression normal tissue primary tumor , subsequently metastatic node . We select several candidate gene subsequent analysis use HNSCC tissue array . Through DNA microarray analysis technique look genetic molecular characteristic , detail knowledge malignant transformation process , alteration therapy , patient may obtain . This study seek perform comprehensive molecular genetic profiling improve biomarker development HNSCC correlate data patient clinical data . Ultimately hop tumor specific genetic abnormality may identify could provide target treatment strategy gene therapy , immunotherapy , intervention . Study Objectives : To evaluate gene expression pattern human head neck squamous cell carcinoma correlate treatment response , surgical non-surgical . To identify series diagnostic marker blood , urine and/or sputum head neck squamous cell carcinoma study mechanism action protein .</detailed_description>
