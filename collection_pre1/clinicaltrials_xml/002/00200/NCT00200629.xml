	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease remain leading cause morbidity mortality woman account 250,000 death per year . Despite high prevalence ischemic heart disease woman , clinical trial focus male cohort . The optimal non-invasive test evaluation ischemic heart disease woman unknown . A number different modality employ include exercise ECG stress test , 2-dimensional stress echocardiography , SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging , electron beam computerize tomography . The cohort woman perform test upon also ill-defined . Myocardial perfusion imaging , conjunction pharmacologic stress testing , also show effective diagnosis woman know suspected coronary artery disease well risk stratification . Recently , pharmacologic stress combine low-level exercise , enhance test tolerability SPECT perfusion image quality . Furthermore , use combine adenosine exercise protocol may detect great amount ischemia perfusion image exercise test alone . Therefore , woman may unable perform maximal exercise , combine pharmacologic exercise image protocol may possess significant advantage adenosine stress test alone . The aim study compare safety symptom associate two method stress test . The current study also seek establish optimal method detection coronary artery disease woman limit capacity exercise ( DASI score ≤5 METS ) , also well examine prognostic value method test compare two-year event rate woman undergo adenosine SPECT image SPECT image use adenosine adjunctive exercise .</detailed_description>
