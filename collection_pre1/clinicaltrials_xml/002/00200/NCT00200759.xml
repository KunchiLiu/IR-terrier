	<detailed_description>The use cranberry ( CB ) juice powder , alone combination conventional medicine , become common treatment urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) acute chronic condition . Cytochromes P450 enzymes group proteins involve metabolism certain substance . A group cytochrome P-450 ( CYP ) enzymes extensively involved drug metabolism . The pharmacokinetics many drug often vary considerably among individual , largely variation expression different cytochrome P-450 ( CYP ) enzymes liver tissue . Flavonoids antioxidant may health benefit . The flavonoid may also responsible cranberry 's effect urinary tract infection . To evaluate drug interaction potential cranberry , single dos three safe probe drug alprazolam , dextromethorphan , caffeine administer 14-day treatment period cranberry powder . Changes pharmacokinetics probe drug indicate degree enzyme inhibition induction . The key pharmacokinetic parameter four major CB flavonoid estimate follow plasma concentration versus time course absorbed flavonoid excretion urine . The area plasma concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) , oral clearance ( Clo ) , terminal elimination half-life ( T1/2 ) renal clearance ( Clren ) determine : epicatechin , quercetin ( total glycoside ) , procyanidin A2 , cyanidin-3-galactoside .</detailed_description>
