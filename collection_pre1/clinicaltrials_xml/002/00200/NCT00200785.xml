	<brief_title>Identifying Anti-Blood-Clotting Compounds Garlic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Published study indicate various type undefined garlic product display antiplatelet activity . However , compound responsible antiplatelet effect identify . Acute study . In acute ( one day ) study , healthy participant consume several dos `` fresh garlic '' ( garlic powder add ambient water ; equivalent 12 gram fresh garlic 52 mg allicin ) paste tuna sandwich . At 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 hour consumption , ability platelet aggregate platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) whole blood ( WB ) , response drug ( collagen , ADP ) stimulate platelet aggregation , measure . After establish optimum dose optimum time antiplatelet effect person , effect sufficiently strong , effect cook garlic ( garlic powder add boiling water , allicin present ) seven extracted fraction ( oil , protein , fructans , etc . ) determine , use fraction dose abundance establish optimum dose crush fresh garlic . Chronic study . If weak platelet effect find high acute dose `` fresh '' garlic , chronic study conduct . In chronic study , participant consume 8.0 gram `` fresh garlic '' ( 2.7 gram garlic powder add ambient water , allicin content = 35 mg ) paste tuna sandwich every day four week 8.0 gram `` boil garlic '' ( 2.7 gram garlic powder add boiling water ) sandwich every day additional four week , 1-week washout . The ability platelet aggregate PRP whole blood determine every week garlic consumption begin 1-week washout .</detailed_description>
