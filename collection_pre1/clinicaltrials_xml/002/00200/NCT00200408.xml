	<brief_summary>This study look genetic profile cell take oral cavity healthy college student smoke smoke cigarette . This do use small brush similar use Pap test cervical cancer detection . Our aim determine smoking cause early genetic change DNA cell see cell cancerous tumor head neck area nearby healthy tissue . This correlate data subject questionnaires assess tobacco use , behavior demographic information .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Early Genetic Changes Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our pilot study use cellular DNA ( cDNA ) microarrays examine buccal mucosa smoker non-smokers demonstrate smoker could separate non-smokers base solely patterns gene expression observe . We able identify 924 gene whose expression differs significantly sample smoker non-smokers . Several gene also show either regulate earlier research apply microarray analysis head neck cancer tumor . Many represent gene possible interest early molecular marker head neck carcinogenesis . Aberrant methylation important event transcriptional silencing candidate tumor suppressor gene smoke associated malignancy . Furthermore , know methylated CpG island prefer bind site benzo ( ) pyrene diol epoxide carcinogen find tobacco smoke . Binding compound know cause DNA adduct transversion mutation often observe aerodigestive tumor smoker . New evidence suggest specific DNA methylation event directly link tobacco use . The ability detect molecular marker screen high risk group would represent significant advance cancer screen early detection . Our group evaluate specimen epigenetically profile CpG island hypermethylation . head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) tumor sample use technique know methylation specific restriction enzyme microarray analysis . This method use trial detect alteration global DNA methylation pattern subject smoke compare n't . The objective study : 1 . Test hypothesis specific genetic alteration , lead gene expression profile change , detect early smoker . 2 . Test hypothesis early smoker demonstrate alteration global DNA methylation pattern compare matched control . 3 . To analyze gene alteration DNA methylation college smoker time longitudinal follow-up .</detailed_description>
