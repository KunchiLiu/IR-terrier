	<detailed_description>Research Plan Hypothesis Specific Aims : Asthma gastroesophageal reflux common medical condition infant child adult , often co-exist ( Gibson 2002 , Andze , 1991 ) . Though association overt reflux disease asthma well describe accept , occult acid reflux also show associate asthma . The vex question whether non-acidic reflux exacerbate asthma , particularly moderate severe asthma . Current approach extensive literature date deal role acid reflux , hence medical management dominate gastric acid suppression strategy recently outline consensus statement North American Society Pediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology Nutrition ( Rudolph 2001 ) . Based consensus , randomize double blind study adult , strategy use long-term proton pump inhibitor . Clinically , intervention limited impact , treatment failure common . Now non-acid gastroesophageal reflux measure combined impedance pH probe , role non acid reflux finally evaluate . Our experience thus far confirm finding limit publish pediatric study use significant role non-acid reflux `` non -responders '' , indeed suggest great role non-acid GER extra-esophageal disorder general . This new tool supercedes standard pH probe . Currently standard care moderate severe asthma evaluation association gastroesophageal reflux . These case NCC-Wilmington undergo 24 hour combine impedance pH study . With advent new tool NCC-Orlando also , plan combine resource several site accumulate data prevalence acid non-acid reflux asthma . This would effective use data retrieval attribute EPIC . Future study look impact type refluxate bronchospasm , parenchymal damage , even chronic pulmonary vascularity change prospectively would set . Since currently specific recommendation medical treatment non-acid GER , therapeutic strategy , either exist new motility agent , could also evaluate future develop practice guideline . Specific Aim : . What prevalence acid non-acid GER moderate severe asthma patient refer GI evaluation Prevalence acid non-acid gastroesophageal reflux child 1 18 yr moderate asthma severe asthma , refer evaluation gastroesophageal reflux NCC-Wilmington , New Jersey , NCC-Orlando obtain . This information extract EPIC template current standard care incorporate .</detailed_description>
