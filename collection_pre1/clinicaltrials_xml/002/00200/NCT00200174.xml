	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn effect two drug give together . The name drug raloxifene exemestane . Raloxifene drug relate estrogen . In liver bone , act like estrogen . In breast uterus act like anti-estrogen . It use postmenopausal woman prevent disease call osteoporosis . This disease decrease bone strength many year may finally lead bone fracture . In group woman take drug , also seem decrease chance breast cancer possibly endometrial cancer ( cancer uterus ) . Therefore , want study see prevents breast cancer . We also want find may even well prevent breast cancer give another drug . The drug trial exemestane . Exemestane type drug work decrease estrogen level postmenopausal woman . This type drug use woman treatment breast cancer . Before decide two drug combine well prevent breast cancer , must first test drug together make sure safe . This safety test purpose trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Estrogen Blockade Breast With Exemestane Raloxifene Postmenopausal Women With History Breast Cancer Who Have No Clinical Evidence Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective project investigate safety toxicity combination raloxifene , selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) , exemestane , new steroidal aromatase inhibitor , postmenopausal woman history breast cancer clinical evidence disease . The study cohort consist postmenopausal woman history AJCC Stage 0 , I , II , III breast cancer completion plan adjuvant therapy . The study cohort limit patient already receive anti-estrogen therapy part post-operative adjuvant treatment . Patients history invasive ER- and/or PR-positive breast cancer eligible receive anti-estrogen part adjuvant therapy , least 2 year time primary surgery . Tamoxifen show reduce incidence contralateral breast cancer regardless estrogen expression primary tumor may therefore offer chemopreventive agent patient receive anti-estrogen adjuvant setting . This population patient also reasonable cohort test chemoprevention regimen . Our hypothesis combination raloxifene exemestane may offer alternative treatment chemoprevention may prove effective anti-estrogen alone . Endpoints study determine whether combination raloxifene exemestane safe tolerable respect : 1. marker bone turnover bone mineral density 2. serum lipoprotein profile 3. quality life ( particular , symptom estrogen deficiency ) 4. pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug . We also determine feasibility use mammography breast MRI image assess effect combination radiographic breast density . As part correlative laboratory study breast biopsy material , woman may undergo optional biopsy unaffected breast . Breast biopsy material evaluate pre- 3 month post-treatment determine whether combination impact breast tissue aromatase activity breast tissue estrogen level , potential surrogate endpoint biological marker .</detailed_description>
