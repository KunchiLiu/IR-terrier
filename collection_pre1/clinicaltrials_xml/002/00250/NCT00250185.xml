	<brief_summary>Many study show human body stress lack blood flow short period time , body develop defense make body resistant future stress lack blood flow . This natural defense system call preconditioning . Finding medication precondition effect protect damage loss blood flow would great help treatment disease heart attack stroke occur blockage blood flow . Predicting future heart attack stroke difficult make difficult study medication could precondition effect . However , recently recognize mimic preconditioning effect human arm , block blood flow use blood pressure cuff pressure . Here , blow cuff 5 minute let pressure 5 minute repeat process twice ( way precondition arm ) , show improve blood vessel function response long period blood pressure cuff inflation ( 20 minute ) . As nitrite , naturally occur blood substance , biological effect suggest may mimic preconditioning . The main objective study ass whether nitrite equivalent preconditioning capacity protect forearm blood flow response 20 minute blockage blood flow blood pressure cuff inflation forearm . We hypothesize human subject ischemic precondition program work activation pool nitrite blood stream . Moreover , propose nitrite treatment improve ( 1 ) blood vessel recovery ( 2 ) skeletal muscle blood flow ( 3 ) skeletal muscle mitochondrial function ( 4 ) reduce activation inflammation response 20 minute stress blood pressure cuff inflation .</brief_summary>
