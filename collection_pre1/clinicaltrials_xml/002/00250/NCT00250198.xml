	<brief_summary>This study test whether new experimental drug call STA-5326 mesylate decrease inflammatory chemical call cytokine patient Crohn 's disease . The drug prevent gut inflammation mouse rat improve symptom human active Crohn 's disease . Patients Crohn 's Disease 18 75 year age active disease symptom may eligible study . Candidates screen review medical record , medical history physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood urine test , chest x-ray tuberculin skin test . They fill diary card 7 day ( measure symptom Crohn 's Disease Activity Index , CDAI ) complete 32-item Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( IBDQ ) survey disease affect live activity . Participants colonoscopy ( examination colon use light tube ) start study medication . Colon tissue sample biopsied procedure . Following colonoscopy , patient randomly assign receive either STA-5326 mesylate placebo ( sugar dummy pill ) . They take four tablet day see clinic week ( day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 29 ) follow test procedure : - Physical examination - Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 - Blood test - Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 - Pharmacodynamic study ( blood collect first dose medicine 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 8 hour measure level drug blood ) - Day 1 - CDAI IBDQ - Days 1 , 15 , 29 - Review medication symptoms - Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 - EKG - Days 8 , 29 - Pregnancy test woman child-bearing potential - Days 15 , 29 - Urine test - Day 29 After patient complete treatment test , undergo second colonoscopy within 48 hour last dose study medication may offer another 1-week supply medication . Those additional treatment deem potentially beneficial offer another 4-week course drug placebo ( continue whichever take first 4 week ) . They come clinic two visit 2 week apart ( day 43 57 ) physical examination , blood test , EKG , pregnancy test woman , CDAI , IBDQ review medication symptom . A urine sample collect day 57 . A third colonoscopy do test complete day 57 , within 48 hour last dose study medication . Patients return clinic 1 week final dose study medication ( day 36 patient complete 1 month treatment day 64 complete second month treatment ) limit physical examination , blood test , pregnancy test woman , CDAI IBDQ , review medication symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Immunological Blood Effects STA-5326 Mesylate Patients With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study measure mucosal immunological effect peripheral blood effect oral IL-12/23 inhibitor , STA-5326 mesylate , subject active Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . Crohn 's disease chronic , relapse inflammatory condition small large bowel associate excessive Th1 cytokine production . Since IL-12 key cytokine drive Th1 response , novel therapy target IL-12 successful treat CD animal model human . Data human animal model suggest IL-12 IL-23 may role active gut inflammation . STA-5326 mesylate oral drug suppress IL-12p40 production ( subunit share IL-12 IL-23 ) vitro apparent safety clinical activity recent open-label trial treatment CD . This protocol enroll randomize 12 subject moderate severe active CD ( CD Activity Index [ CDAI ] 220 450 , inclusive ) 4 week daily study drug treatment ( 9 subject receive 100 mg STA-5326 mesylate 3 receive placebo ) . Subjects evaluate safety include monitor adverse event concomitant medication , clinical laboratory testing , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) tracing , physical examination include vital sign . Efficacy assessment include CDAI , Simple Endoscopic Score CD ( SES-CD ) , result Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( IBDQ ) , change Baseline plasma C reactive protein ( CRP ) ( measure high sensitivity assay ) . In addition , immunologic effect ( lymphocyte phenotyping cytokine secretion peripheral blood lamina propria mononuclear cell [ LPMCs ] ) assess . Descriptive statistic ( n , mean , median , standard deviation , minimum maximum range ) use summarize data treatment group .</detailed_description>
