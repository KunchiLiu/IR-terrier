	<brief_title>Anabolic Steroids Exercise Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dialysis patient limited physical functioning measure self-reported functioning , peak oxygen consumption , physical performance test , test muscle strength . A recent study highlight severity debility , report one third hemodialysis patient unable perform normal activity daily live without assistance . In addition , physical function show major determinant patient ' assessment global quality life . Taken together , available evidence suggest impaired physical functioning widespread among dialysis patient profoundly affect life . Therefore , intervention improve function population potential significantly improve quality life . Muscle waste weakness particularly attractive target intervention relate loss function objectively measure targeted improvement . Small study support possible benefit two strategy increase muscle size strength among patient dialysis . Anabolic steroids frequently use ameliorate anemia associate end-stage renal disease prior introduction recombinant erythropoietin , agent note cause increase serum creatinine along increase hemoglobin hematocrit . More recently , nandrolone decanoate show increase lean body mass improve physical performance , resistance exercise train show increase strength improve physical performance . Neither preliminary result confirm , relative benefit strategy potential additive synergistic effect examine . Therefore , design study compare change lean body mass , muscle size strength , physical performance , self-reported functioning a12 week period among hemodialysis patient randomly assign one four group : 1 ) nandrolone decanoate , synthetic testosterone derivative , weekly intramuscular injection ( ND ) ; 2 ) weekly placebo injection ( PL ) ; 3 ) low extremity resistance exercise training dialysis session three time per week plus weekly placebo injection ( EX ) ; 4 ) resistance exercise plus nandrolone injection weekly ( EX+ND ) .</detailed_description>
