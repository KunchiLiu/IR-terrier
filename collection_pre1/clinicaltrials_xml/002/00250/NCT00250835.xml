	<brief_summary>A combination chemotherapy radiation often use treat rectal cancer patient surgery effort shrink tumor make easy remove well help increase chance sphincter-sparing surgery . Many previous clinical study suggest rectal cancer patient may survive long surgery result pathological complete response - , absence tumor cell surgical specimen . However , still controversy . This study attempt start answer question treat rectal cancer patient combination chemotherapy drug ( oxaliplatin capecitabine ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) enzyme inhibitor radiation surgery . The rate pathologic complete response , sphincter-sparing surgery , disease-free survival therapeutic endpoint study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Oxaliplatin , Capecitabine , Celecoxib With Concurrent Radiation Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improved regional control demonstrate low incidence local recurrence concurrent chemoradiation deliver either pre-operatively post-operatively resectable rectal cancer support clinical trial data impact overall survival either approach remain controversial . An ideal regimen preoperative chemoradiation locally advanced rectal cancer would include agent potent radio-sensitizers effective treat micro-metastatic disease without excessive toxicity . The cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) enzyme express colorectal cancer , exact role expression tumorigenesis remain active area research . The area potential use cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor cancer treatment may use adjunct modality treatment . Taking consideration , previous pilot trial neoadjuvant therapy combine oxaliplatin , capecitabine , celecoxib ( COX-2 inhibitor ) , radiation conduct four patient operable rectal cancer . Promising result , include pain relief downstaging cancer , observe . Therefore , single-arm phase II trial preoperative concurrent chemoradiation patient T3-4N0-2M0 rectal cancer initiate assess patient outcome explore relationship COX-2 expression surgical specimen therapeutic endpoint .</detailed_description>
