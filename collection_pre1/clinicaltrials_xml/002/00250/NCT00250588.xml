	<brief_title>Problem-Solving Skills Training Improve Care Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brief description : This 4-year research project develop test culturally linguistically appropriate brief intervention reduce barrier health care vulnerable child persistent asthma . Background : The U.S. health system present formidable challenge timely receipt high quality care , especially vulnerable child ( e.g. , family color , low SES , limited English ability ) . This population great risk poor health outcome . Children asthma important vulnerable subgroup . Asthma , estimate prevalence 6.9 % , common chronic condition child . It frequent reason pediatric hospitalization condition document disparity care outcomes . A promising strategy overcome barrier quality care child encounter use care coordinator educate parent child , connect family need resource , coordinate care different setting . Care coordination show effective improve receipt appropriate asthma service health outcome child asthma . Despite evidence , concern effect care coordination may maintain service end . This particularly important give financial pressure reduce length intensity service . In order maintain gain achieve care coordination , family need able identify overcome barrier care . This achieve use Problem Solving Therapy , document behavioral method teach family skill need resolve daily problem improve adherence medical regimen child chronic health condition . Study Goals : The overall goal project improve quality care health outcome vulnerable child asthma . The specific aim two-phase project : - ( Phase I ) adapt , collaboration community health worker parent , exist material create two culturally linguistically appropriate treatment manual : Care Coordination Treatment Manual standardize delivery culturally linguistically appropriate home-based care coordination asthma-specific education , Problem Solving Therapy Treatment Manual tailor asthma include detail , step-by-step guide implement approach reduce barrier care . - ( Phase II ) use manual develop Phase I perform randomize controlled clinical trial evaluate effectiveness two brief intervention involve Care Coordination tailor Problem Solving Therapy ( tPST ) improve maintain improvement health care quality health-related quality life child asthma . Evidence efficacy tPST availability culturally linguistically appropriate treatment manual spur diffusion innovation practitioner program seek evidence-based , optimal clinical management strategy . Methodology : Phase I . Existing material Care Coordination tPST manual edit and/or rewritten make specific asthma . Then manual propose intervention assessed cultural acceptability though two series parallel focus group : one parent child asthma , home visitor already provide care coordination family child asthma . The revised educational material translate Spanish . Phase II . Children age 2-12 year persistent asthma family ( n = 366 ) randomize two brief intervention : 1. tPST ( six session ) plus Care Coordination ( six home visit 3 month ) versus Wait List control group ( usual care ) evaluate intervention 's effectiveness improve outcomes 3 month baseline . 2. tPST versus Care Coordination Wait List evaluate intervention 's effectiveness maintain outcomes 9 month baseline .</detailed_description>
