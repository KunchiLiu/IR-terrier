	<brief_summary>The objective research determine whether treatment magnesium reduce incidence atrial fibrillation patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Several small study magnesium already conduct , study small result conflict . A large , well-conducted study magnesium treatment require definitively determine whether magnesium effective preventing common complication surgery . In addition , study include patient undergo valvular surgery , group previously exclude research despite fact increase risk atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient refer non-emergent cardiac surgery isolate CABG , isolate valvular heart surgery , combine valvular CABG surgery eligible study . Subjects randomize prior surgery ( 1:1 ) receive 5 g magnesium placebo ( saline ) bolus anaesthesiologist upon removal crossclamp . On postoperative day 1 4 , subject receive either IV MgSO4 ( 5g 250 ml normal saline ) IV placebo ( 250 ml normal saline ) infusion 4 hour daily . Atrial fibrillation ( arrhythmias ) detect place subject continuous 24-hour ECG telemetry monitor postoperative day 0 4 . The study power detect least 30 % relative reduction postoperative atrial fibrillation CABG group ; n=756 . Because high incidence atrial fibrillation Valve +/- CABG group total 500 patient require detect least 30 % difference treatment group . These sample size base alpha 0.05 80 % power .</detailed_description>
