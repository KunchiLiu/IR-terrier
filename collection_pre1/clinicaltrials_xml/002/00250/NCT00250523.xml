	<brief_summary>The purpose research study gather clinical biologic information severely injured patient well understand characterize host response injury inflammation across several domain . This information may improve outcome prediction , improve clinical treatment injured patient , permit construction non-biologic computerized model illness utilized represent host response future research effort . This study design calibration mathematical model response predictive capability . The central hypothesis govern study adaptive immune element crucial determine outcome complex inflammatory scenario . We propose test hypothesis follow interrelate Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 : To develop robust mathematical model describe trauma/hemorrhage-induced inflammation human , pathologic consequence , possible therapy . Specific Aim 2 : To translate mathematical model human create software aim individualized clinical decision-making . Specific Aim 3 : To determine prevalence IL-1 receptor-associated kinase ( IRAK-1 ) variant haplotype locate X-chromosome injured population , characterize difference pro-inflammatory response across gender , relative IRAK-1 haplotype . Specific Aim 4 : To determine increased arginase activity previously observe isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cell trauma patient consequence presence contaminate activate granulocyte particular subset arginase positive monocyte subset .</brief_summary>
