	<brief_summary>This study aim determine effectiveness Gefitinib ( Iressa ) recurrent glioblastoma standard treatment ( surgery , radiationtherapy least first line chemotherapy ) . Gefitinib specific inhibitor epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . EGFR elevate 50 % malignant glioma . At recurrence , secondary surgery pre- postoperative Gefitinib offer patient good performance status . Clinical outcome patient correlation translational research evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre- Postoperative Use ZD1839 ( Iressa ) Recurrent Glioblastoma , Including Translational Research</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glioblastoma ( GBM ) patient relapse good performance status , without serious neurological deficit offer secondary surgery participation trial . Eligible patient must standard treatment include primary surgery , radiation therapy least first line chemotherapy . Patients cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4-inducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAE ) exclude due ensue interaction drug gefitinib metabolism , reduce systemic availability . After give write informed consent , patient receive gefitinib 500 mg daily start least 5 day prior re-operation , allow steady state condition.Treatment continue tumor progression occurrence intolerable side effects.The specimen collect surgery undergo translational research , aim correlate drug accumulation molecular signature GBM sample clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
