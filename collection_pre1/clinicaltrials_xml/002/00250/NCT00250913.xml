	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose project determine effective telephone-based counseling program help patient heart disease become physically active . Hypotheses test : - Compared usual care , patient physical activity counsel program : 1. significantly increase total distance measure accelerometer minute physical activity moderate intensity high , 2. significantly high generic heart-disease health-related quality life , 3. lead great improvement mediator behavior change ( psychosocial variable , i.e . self-efficacy , outcome expectation , etc . ) 26 52 week ; - Changes mediator physical activity predict change physical activity outcomes 26 52 week ; - The physical activity counsel program preferable usual care perspective health care system cost .</brief_summary>
