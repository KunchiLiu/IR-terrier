	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol investigate possible novel treatment intractable visceral pain patient chronic pancreatitis . Pain major contributor poor quality life patient chronic pancreatitis . The refractory nature condition medical surgical procedure prompt u hypothesize one mechanism lead pain patient dysfunction brain cortical regulation visceral sensation . This notion particularly support finding patient chronic pancreatitis continue experience disabling pain even total pancreatectomy . This suggest symptom sustain pancreas-independent , neural-based mechanism . Visceral sensation particularly process secondary somatosensory area - SII . Therefore , chronic pancreatitis pain may sustain dysfunction SII rather pancreatic inflammation alone . The researcher hypothesize dysfunction SII one hyper-excitability . According hypothesis , suppression SII activity may help control pain patient chronic pancreatitis . Temporary inhibition SII activity obtain novel tool , namely transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , suppress brain excitability non-invasively beyond duration TMS appropriate stimulation parameter employ . In initial sham control , double blind pilot trial 5 subject idiopathic chronic pancreatitis , TMS apply SII result significant pain improvement 3 subject . The researcher rigorously test hypothesis chronic pancreatitis pain sustain dysfunction SII characterize hyperexcitability two specific aim : 1 . The first aim study examine whether slow repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) apply SII patient pain chronic pancreatitis analgesic effect measure change Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) pain decrease analgesic intake , well overall improvement quality life . In addition , study find significant effect rTMS pain reduction , duration effect assess . TMS apply parameter stimulation know decrease excitability . 2 . The second aim study assess safety rTMS patient population . In pilot study none patient experience adverse effect single session rTMS . However , extension study protocol 10-day course daily rTMS require careful safety assessment . Fifteen-day course rTMS use treatment various neuropsychiatric disease without complication safety guideline carefully follow . The researcher adhere current safety recommendation rTMS endorsed International Society Transcranial Stimulation International Federation Clinical Neurophysiology . Therefore , researcher hypothesize propose rTMS protocol safe patient population . 3 . The third aim study study physiologic mechanism action rTMS patient use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . In , researcher aim contribute good understand pathophysiology chronic pain patient pancreatitis investigate correlation pain improvement area brain activation . This could lead development marker therapeutic response . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy allow non-invasive measure GABAergic glutamatergic activity define volume interest brain . The researcher hypothesize balance GABA glutamate abnormal SII patient pain chronic pancreatitis , relative decrease GABA increase glutamate indicate abnormal , hyperexcitable dysfunction . This abnormality normalize rTMS correlation analgesic effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible : They age 18 year older They daily abdominal pain least three month attribute chronic pancreatitis Average pain score ( VAS ) baseline period high 4 . The diagnosis chronic pancreatitis base existence chronic abdominal pain least one four follow criterion : Calcifications throughout pancreas plain abdominal radiograph . Endoscopically derive pancreatogram showing ductal change consistent chronic pancreatitis . Abnormal secretin pancreatic function test peak bicarbonate level le 70 mEq/L ( normal &gt; 80 mEq/L ) . Tissue diagnosis chronic pancreatitis surgical specimen . Other cause chronic pancreatitis exclude follow : Hereditary pancreatitis base genetic mutation family history pancreatitis ; Alcohol abuse ( criterion `` risk '' [ heavy ] drink establish National Institute Alcohol Abuse Alcoholism [ NIAAA ] , suggest person risk adverse consequence , great 14 drink per week 4 drink per occasion men , great 7 drink per week 3 drink per occasion woman ) ; Medications associate development pancreatitis ( e.g . valproic acid , metronidazole , tetracycline , sulfonamide , nitrofurantoin , azathioprine , pentamidine ) , trauma , metabolic cause include hyperlipidemia hypercalcemia , autoimmune pancreatitis . Participants exclude know complication chronic pancreatitis require intervention include pseudocysts pancreatic duct obstruction presence cancer . In addition , order minimize risk TMS , follow exclusion criterion follow : Patients clinical diagnosis severe depression include suicidal ideation ; Prior neurosurgical procedure ; Past history epilepsy family history epilepsy ; Previous head injury ; Metal locate head , i.e . shrapnel , surgical clip , fragment weld ; Signs increase intracranial pressure ; Stroke ; Chronic treatment epileptogenic medication ; Abnormal neurological examination sign condition study present protocol ; Implanted pacemaker ; Medication pump ; Vagal stimulator ; Deep brain stimulator ; Transcutaneous electrical stimulation ( TENS ) unit ventriculoperitoneal shunt ; Pregnancy ; Other chronic medical condition history substance abuse ; History medical surgical therapy pain within 3 month .</criteria>
