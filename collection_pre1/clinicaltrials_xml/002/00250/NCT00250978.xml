	<brief_summary>Your lung cancer cause fluid build space around lung . This fluid call malignant pleural effusion . This fluid take space chest , prevents lung fully fill air . As result , may experience shortness breath , cough , chest discomfort . Your doctor determine would feel well surgeon pulmonary specialist remove fluid immediately . Your doctor offer admit hospital , drain fluid use Pleur-XTM catheter . Once Pleur-X catheter place , doctor would like start chemotherapy . Your doctor decide treat chemotherapy . If chemotherapy work kill cancer cell body , cancer make less fluid , doctor able remove Pleur-XTM catheter sooner . It possible add second drug chemotherapy , call bevacizumab may make fluid dry even faster . It know whether add bevacizumab chemotherapy patient Pleur-XTM catheter place helpful , potentially harmful , use chemotherapy alone . For reason , patient enrol research protocol receive chemotherapy bevacizumab Pleur-XTM catheter place . The purpose research study determine whether chemotherapy may deliver safely Pleur-XTM catheter place .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph I : Bevacizumab + Chemotherapy Pts w/Malig Pleural Effusion Due Adv NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct patient advanced NSCLC ( stage IIIB-IV ) MPE require therapeutic drainage , also eligible treatment chemotherapy plus bevacizumab ( define protocol Section 6.0 ) . All patient undergo placement Pleur-XTM catheter part routine practice . Eligible patient may enroll protocol prior , within 10 day follow placement Pleur-XTM catheter . Upon enrollment , patient give logsheet record volume pleural fluid drain catheter . Only patient , opinion treat physician , hemorrhagic pleural effusion ( grossly bloody , pleural fluid hemoglobin concentration &gt; 25 % blood hemoglobin concentration ) may remain study . In addition , patient , opinion treat physician , satisfactory placement Pleur-XTM catheter may remain study . Approximately 15 patient enrolled goal treat 10 patient chemotherapy plus bevacizumab . The additional enrollment necessary estimate approximately 1 3 patient take study due failure Pleur-XTM catheter placement , discovery hemorrhagic effusion . Patients remain study begin chemotherapy . All eligible patient receive bevacizumab 15mg/kg IV x 1 dose single agent . Three week later , chemotherapy initiate accord routine clinical practice along continue use bevacizumab . Acceptable chemotherapy regimens protocol detailed Section 5.0 protocol . Only administration bevacizumab govern protocol ( Section 11.0 ) . Dose reduction drug make accord routine clinical practice . Pleural fluid drain Pleur-XTM least every day ( qod ) , volume record patient log book . Pleur-XTM catheter may remove pleural symphysis achieve ( defined Section 12.0 ) , discretion treat physician . The schedule follow-up visit may vary accord chemotherapy regimen , however patient must evaluate clinic least every 3 week doctor visit record drainage volume , status Pleur-XTM catheter .</detailed_description>
