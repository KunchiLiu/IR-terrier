	<brief_summary>This study evaluate gather information patient genetic cause much androgen ( male-like hormone ) order well understand effect much androgen describe problem associate . Too much androgen childhood , untreated , result rapid growth early puberty early cessation growth short stature adulthood . Too much androgen adulthood may result infertility , woman may excess facial hair , acne male-like appearance . Excess androgen may also affect mood behavior possibly secretion hormone , insulin . Two genetic disease result early childhood androgen excess congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) familial male-limited precocious puberty ( FMPP ) . Patients know suspected CAH due 21-hydroxylase deficiency , 11- hydroxylase deficiency , 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency male know suspected FMPP may eligible study . Patients classic non-classic CAH eligible , patient androgen excess unknown cause may eligible . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Medical history physical examination . - Fasting blood test analysis hormone , blood chemistry include blood sugar cardiovascular risk factor lipid . - Oral glucose tolerance test patient elevate insulin level . For test , catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein patient 's arm . The patient drink sugar-containing fluid blood sample collect catheter interval start drink solution , 30 , 60 120 minute drink solution . - 24-hour urine collection measure hormone level urine . - DNA test patient 21-hydroxylase deficiency help identify type genetic mutation responsible disease . - X-ray left hand measure bone age grow child . The x-ray use determine far puberty child much growth potential leave bone . - A pelvic ultrasound female testicular ultrasound male evaluate size development gonad ( ovary females testis male ) . - Cognitive psychological test , include IQ test evaluation memory , achievement behavior . - Other test evaluation base medical need . The schedule procedures varies . In part study involve patient CAH , grow child evaluate twice ( childhood reach adult height ) , adults evaluate . In another part study involve patient CAH FMPP , grow child see twice year , adult child reach adult height may see annually . Additional visit may schedule medically indicate . In part study , female ask keep record period first menstrual cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Study Patients With Excess Androgen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Androgen excess childhood result pseudoprecocious puberty , accelerate childhood growth premature epiphyseal fusion , adult short stature , unknown metabolic psychological perturbation . Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) familial male-limited precocious puberty ( FMPP ) two genetic disease result early childhood androgen excess , CAH due 21-hydroxylase deficiency common cause hyperandrogenism childhood . This protocol elucidate comprehensive phenotypic profile patient CAH FMPP . Data collect large cohort patient regard growth development , hormonal metabolic factor psychological characteristic . This protocol allow investigator compare patient androgen excess different etiology , elucidate androgen-mediated disease-specific phenotypic characterization , allow investigator acquire knowledge use design future therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Males know suspected FMPP . Patients know suspected CAH due 21hydroxylase deficiency , 11hydroxylase deficiency , 3betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency . Classic nonclassic patient eligible . Patients excess androgen unknown etiology . Relatives patient CAH FMPP . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Females isolate polycystic ovary syndrome . If , follow diagnostic workup , patient determine PCOS cause hyperandrogenism ; long follow protocol . Patients significant nonendocrine medical condition .</criteria>
