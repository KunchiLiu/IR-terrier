	<brief_title>TRAIL-CC : Trachelectomy , Radical Hysterectomy , Intimate Life After Cervical Cancer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improvements treatment cancer result increased focus quality life issue . Sexual health one important aspect quality life often disrupted cervical cancer survivor . However , currently establish treatment sexual problem , often leave woman partner long-term difficulty interfere aspect relationship live . Treatment cervical cancer involve hysterectomy ( i.e . removal uterus ) , commonly bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ( BSO ; i.e . bilateral removal ovary fallopian tube ) . Hysterectomy result direct physical consequence sexual function attribute probable autonomic nerve damage ( Butler-Manuel et al. , 2000 ; 2002 ; Weijmar Schultz et al. , 1991 ) . Depending extent disease , hysterectomy may either simple ( i.e . surgical removal uterus without excision adjoin tissue ) radical ( i.e . surgical removal uterus , parametria uterosacral ligament , upper portion vagina , pelvic lymph node ) . In last two decade , new procedure know trachelectomy , surface treat early stage cervical cancer . Unlike radical hysterectomy , trachelectomy procedure aim preserve fertility young woman wish child post cervical cancer treatment ( Plante et al. , 2004 ; 2005 ) . This preservation fertility trachelectomy result leave patient 's uterus intact remove cervix , parametrium upper one third vagina . With uterus intact , patient capable conceive multiple birth post-procedure ( Bernardini et al. , 2003 , Plante et al. , 2004 ; 2005 ) , option present past woman radical hysterectomy . The dozen study do look outcome trachelectomy mainly focus medical outcome fertility cancer cure recurrence . The finding show 70-72 % success rate woman try conceive post-trachelectomy ( Boss et al. , 2005 , Plante et al. , 2005 ) . If patient eligible trachelectomy procedure , accord criterion ( Sonoda et al. , 2004 ) , recurrence-free survival excellent 95 % ( Plante et al. , 2004 ) . With improvement identification cure cervical cancer use fertility-sparing technique , increase number young patient remission , raise number quality life issue . Sexual health recognize integral aspect quality life survivorship increasingly receive research clinical attention ( Juraskova et al. , 2003 ; Wenzel et al. , 2002 ) . In study do trachelectomy find handful woman , prior operation , wish conceive child , post-operation lose desire try conceive ( Boss et al. , 2005 , Plante et al. , 2005 ) , study do area reason . Although study beneficial medical information none study examine efficacy trachelectomy study impact sexual health quality life . On hand , research effect radical hysterectomy woman cervical cancer find approximately half woman experience negative sexual side-effects significantly lubrication difficulty , reduce vaginal length elasticity , mark distress ( Bergmark et al. , 1999 ) . Also distress 36 % woman group absence genital swell half sexual encounter , despite change sexual frequency orgasmic experience ( Bergmark et al. , 1999 ) . When vaginal photoplethysmograph use document change genital blood flow ( indirect measure sexual arousal ) , woman radical hysterectomy impairment blood flow responses either control group simple hysterectomy group , suggest involvement autonomic nerve ( Maas et al. , 2002 ) . Given woman , together partner oncologist , may find position select one procedure another , seem important good understand relative effect procedure intimate life sexual health . The objective study , therefore , compare radical hysterectomy trachelectomy effect intimacy , sexual health , mood immediately , 1 month , 6 month surgery . This study help identify pattern outcomes aspects quality life hop well inform woman potential outcome procedure . Cervical cancer treatment life-altering event ; therefore desirable identify hopefully reduce negative psychological physical sequela treatment . We want ensure problem related post-cervical cancer diminish survivor 's quality life maintain acceptable level , allow patient continue live fulfil life , uninhibited sexual emotional distress .</detailed_description>
