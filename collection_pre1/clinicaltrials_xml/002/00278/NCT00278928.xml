	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomized trial determine difference exist tolerance lipid injectable emulsion neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . Lipid injectable emulsion essential nutrient neonatal growth development . Traditionally , lipid injectable emulsion commercially available sterile glass bottle , April 2004 , new container introduce sterile plastic bag . In January , 2005 , NICU personnel observe appear high usual incidence hypertriglyceridemia . Upon laboratory investigation lipid injectable emulsion store glass bottle versus plastic , significant difference note population large-diameter fat globule globule size analysis , reflective less stable emulsion plastic . The United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) set standard drug purity safety U.S. , whose drug monograph enforceable FDA , propose limit large diameter fat globule population volume-weighted percent fat great five micrometer PFAT5 le 0.05 % total lipid concentration . ( At present time , USP monograph officially recognize , track adoption 2006 . ) Our preliminary analysis four lot 20 % lipid injectable emulsion package glass PFAT5 0.003±0.0008 % , compare approximate 55-fold increase large-diameter fat globule population 0.166±0.016 % equal number product package plastic . We hypothesize difference may explain recent clinical observation . We compare incidence hypertriglyceridemia neonate lipid package glass versus plastic . The study attempt discern whether difference package influence stability subsequent tolerance lipid injectable emulsion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study single-center ( BIDMC ) , prospective , single-blinded , randomize control study involve neonatal ICU patient receive lipid injectable emulsion infusion part normal clinical care . The dose protocol neonate weight- age-based , show : Birth Weight ( &lt; 1000 g ) Age ( Day Life , DOL ) - Lipid Dose g/kg/day : DOL1- 0 ; DOL2- 1 ; DOL3- 1.5 ; DOL4- 2 ; DOL5- 2.5 ; DOL6+-3 Birth Weight ( &gt; 1000 g ) Age-Lipid Dose g/kg/day : DOL1- 0 ; DOL2- 1 ; DOL3- 2 ; DOL4- 3 ; DOL5- 3 ; DOL6+-3 Serum triglycerides primary outcome indicator tolerance initiation advancement lipid injectable emulsion . Blood sample draw initiation lipid either DOL-0 DOL-1 , DOL-4 DOL-7 . The procedure initiate lipid emulsion neonate follow usual protocol per NICU guideline . On DOL-2 , order 20 % soybean oil lipid emulsion write physician designate licensed assistant per protocol . The Pharmacy Department receive order , compound dispense appropriately sized syringe . Patients receive lipid take either glass bottle plastic bag accord pre-assigned randomization scheme . All lipid injectable emulsion lot glass plastic record use study . In addition , lot analyze respect globule size distribution Nutrition/Infection Laboratory . Sample Size Justification : Approximately 82 randomized patient require analysis difference lipid injectable emulsion formulation . The sample size generate data obtain retrospective analysis describe B2 . A two-sided test base normal distribution , nominal significance level 0.05 , statistical power 0.80 assume . Based assumption , power calculation reveals equal sample size group calculate 41 . Hence , total sample size 82 patient require detect statistically significant difference incidence hypertriglyceridemia infusion group . Data Analysis : We compare lipid tolerance critically ill neonate receive pharmacy-prepared syrinx 20 % soybean oil-based lipid injectable emulsion take commercially available , FDA-approved product use either glass plastic packaging container . The primary outcome variable assess lipid tolerance serum triglyceride . A two-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) employ assess difference lipid injectable emulsion product . The two independent variable 1 ) Lipid Container ( Treatment ) , 2 ) Time ( 7 day ) ; dependent variable serum triglyceride . If significant difference detect ANOVA , individual difference evaluate use Bonferroni test pair wise comparison . All data express mean ± SD statistical significance set p-value &lt; 0.05 . Analysis do BIDMC supervision study PI . Although expect play significant role , drop-out miss data adjust accordingly . All patient present neonatal intensive care unit BIDMC require intravenous nutritional support provide inform consent include study . The decision initiate intravenous nutritional support make clinical personnel , dose protocol lipid injectable emulsion follow institutional procedure show B3 ( Description Study Protocol ) ( section1-a ) . Patients randomize receive one two study parenteral lipid emulsion . As hydrocortisone therapy rarely use treatment refractory hypotension neonate , show induce hypertriglyceridemia low birth weight infant ( young 29 week ' gestational age birth ) , patient exclude study . Due randomization , patient enrol either group expect similarly distribute respect gestational age , gender race . Potential study subject identify neonatal intensive care unit physicians BIDMC determine intravenous nutrition support clinically indicate . Parent ( ) guardian ( ) NICU patient review sign write informed consent form . The form obtain NICU physicians one co-investigators list . Prospective parent guardian patient present , lay term , two option provide intravenous lipid emulsion . The purpose study current data regard standard care present parent guardian patient , assignment either group ( glass vs. plastic ) random determine chance . Parents guardian informed participation completely voluntary patient data keep confidential . All aspect study take place neonatal intensive care unit .</detailed_description>
