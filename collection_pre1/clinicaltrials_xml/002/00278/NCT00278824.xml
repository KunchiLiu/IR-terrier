	<brief_title>Fentanyl Transdermal Patch With CHADD™ Breakthrough Pain Patients With Moderate Severe Non-Malignant Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ZARS Pharma develop Matrix Transdermal Fentanyl/CHADD ( Controlled Heat-Assisted Drug Delivery ) Drug Delivery System use treatment chronic breakthrough pain . The Matrix Transdermal Fentanyl/CHADD Drug Delivery System design provide long-term delivery fentanyl treatment chronic pain well intermittent increase fentanyl concentration treatment breakthrough pain . Breakthrough pain define transitory exacerbation pain occur background otherwise stable pain patient receiving chronic opioid therapy . Matrix Transdermal Fentanyl/CHADD Drug Delivery System 2 component : matrix transdermal fentanyl patch ( ZR-02-01 patch dose 25 , 50 , 75 100 mcg/hr ) correspond thin film dressing ( ie , overlay ) CHADD ( Controlled Heat-Assisted Drug Delivery ) . The matrix transdermal fentanyl patch provide continuous delivery fentanyl 72 hour , manner similar Duragesic® . During breakthrough pain episode , CHADD unit place ( adhere ) matrix transdermal fentanyl patch . The CHADD thin patch-like chemical heating device generates control level heat approximately 15-20 minute . The application heat delivers increase amount fentanyl apply ZR-02-01 matrix transdermal fentanyl patch .</detailed_description>
