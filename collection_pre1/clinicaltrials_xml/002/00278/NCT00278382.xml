	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Recurrent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall response rate , include complete partial response , patient chemosensitive , relapse , aggressive , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat sorafenib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . II . Determine response duration patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 33 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
