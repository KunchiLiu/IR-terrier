	<brief_summary>Melanoma main cause death patient skin cancer . Once metastasize , cancer show respond chemotherapy rare case . Immunotherapy represent approach treatment base immune response cancer antigens . The long-term objective study develop therapeutic approach treatment cancer general , melanoma particular , base immunotherapy , use combination local tumor irradiation follow injection immature dendritic cell ( iDC ) .The treatment follow injection interferon alpha , expect induce activation iDC . This trial base hypothesis local radiation , cause destruction tumor , combination injection patient 's iDC activation cell interferon alpha , induce effective immune response tumor . In order test suggest approach , propose 20-patients clinical trial evaluate objective clinical immunological response propose treatment patient malignant melanoma solid tumor .</brief_summary>
