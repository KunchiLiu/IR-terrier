	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity vorinostat ( SAHA ) , term objective response progression rate , patient advance renal cell carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety tolerability drug , term toxicity profile , patient . II . Evaluate overall survival , progression-free survival , survival rate 12 month patient treated drug . III . Correlate change biologic measurement outcomes patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral vorinostat ( SAHA ) twice daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 , 22-24 . Courses repeat every 28 day 52 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may option continue treatment beyond 52 week discretion investigator . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 1 month approximately every 2 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
