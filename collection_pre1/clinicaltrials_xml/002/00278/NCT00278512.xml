	<brief_summary>The systemic vasculitis wide-ranging group diseases characterize presence blood vessel inflammation ( 1 ) . Despite common feature , type vasculitis unique variety clinical manifestation influence degree disease severity ultimately management . Immunosuppressive therapy form foundation treatment almost form systemic vasculitis . The systemic necrotizing vasculitis ( SNV ) subset vasculitis significant morbidity mortality ( 2 ) . The SNV Wegener 's granulomatosis , allergic angiitis granulomatosis ( AAG ) ( also know Churg-Strauss syndrome ) , polyarteritis nodosum ( PAN ) , microscopic polyangiitis ( MPA ) , overlap syndrome . In spite modern therapeutic immune suppressive agent , remain inconsequential morbidity mortality associate SNV . The current standard therapy SNV chronic oral cyclophosphamide ( 1-3 mg/kg/day ) corticosteroid ( 3-6 ) . Transplant dos cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg infuse 4 day common worldwide transplant regimen systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) ( 7 ) . Like SLE , SNV cyclophosphamide responsive disease . We , therefore , propose trial high dose cyclophosphamide anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) patient SNV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Selection High Dose Immunosuppressive Therapy Autologous HSCT Strategy Trial Selection Regimen High-Dose Immunosuppressive Therapy Cyclophosphamide ATG ( Cy/ATG ) common condition regimen two decade experience treatment aplastic anemia use safely without report mortality treatment autoimmune diseases systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis . Cy/ATG le acute toxicity , less chronic side effect . Cy/ATG associate late malignancy cataract . Cyclophosphamide anti-thymocyte globulin ( horse rabbit ATG ) rituximab potent immunosuppressive agent . Rituximab ATG contribute additional immunosuppression without additional cytotoxicity . Rituximab ATG give shortly pre-transplant contribute elimination host T lymphocytes survive cyclophosphamide contaminate CD34+selected graft . SLE , autoimmune disease responsive cyclophosphamide , respond well Cy/ATG/rituximab condition regimen . For reason , Cy/ATG/rituximab condition regimen utilized study . To justify new therapy HSCT , risk die disease must higher expected treatment , morbidity associate disease must justify treatment risk . Autologous stem cell transplantation mortality 1-3 % breast cancer patient use intense conditioning regimen multiple alkylating agent , 10-15 % patient lymphomas malignancy . The latter patient usually heavily treat transplant accumulation treatment toxicity think play role increase transplant-related mortality . Cyclophosphamide ATG/rituximab use transplant extremely ill patient systemic lupus erythematosus multiple organ dysfunction Northwestern University without mortality . Since patient study early disease course , condition regimen historically associate less toxicity employ . The regimen Cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg ATG 5.5 mg/kg rituximab 1000 mg divide 2 dos . Cyclophosphamide 200mg/kg without ATG use safely effectively variety autoimmune diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , aplastic anemia . Rabbit ATG use instead equine ATG due low incidence hypersensitivity fever rabbit ATG compare equine . Method Harvesting Stem Cells Based experience pilot study , current protocol mobilize stem cell cyclophosphamide granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , collect stem cell apheresis , subsequent bone marrow harvest perform need supplement peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) . Based experience autoimmune flare patient receive G-CSF alone mobilization ( 56 ) , patient mobilize cyclophosphamide 2.0 g/m2 G-CSF 10 mcg /kg . Regimen Autologous HSCT Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide active agent patient wide variety malignancy . It use frequently therapy lymphoid malignancy potent immunosuppressive activity . It frequently use cytotoxic immunosuppressive agent patient undergoing marrow transplant treatment patient autoimmune disease . It alkylating agent require hepatic metabolism active metabolite , phosphoramide mustard acrolein . These active metabolite react nucleophilic group . It available oral intravenous preparation . Bioavailability 90 % give orally . The half-life parent compound 5.3 hour adult , half-life major metabolite phosphoramide mustard 8.5 hour . Liver renal dysfunction lead prolong serum half-life . CY administer intravenously dosage 50 mg/kg two successive day ( use adjust ideal body weight patient 's actual body weight great 100 % ideal body weight ) . The major dose limit side effect high dos cardiac necrosis . Hemorrhagic cystitis occur mediate acrolein metabolite . This prevent co-administration MESNA bladder irrigation . Other notable side effect include nausea , vomit , alopecia , myelosuppression SIADH . Refer institutional manual information administration , toxicity complication . Rabbit-Derived Anti-Thymocyte Globulin ( ATG ) Rabbit-derived anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) gamma globulin preparation obtain hyperimmune serum rabbit immunize human thymocytes . ATG use predominately solid organ transplant immunosuppressive regimen . ATG predominantly lymphocyte-specific immunosuppressive agent . It contain antibody specific antigen commonly find surface T cell . After bind surface molecule , ATG promote depletion T cell circulation mechanism , include opsonization complement-assisted , antibody- dependent , cell-mediated cytotoxicity . The plasma half-life range 1.5-12 day . ATG administer intravenously dose 0.5 mg/kg recipient body weight day -6 dose 1.0 mg/kg recipient body weight day -5 , -4 , -3 , -2 -1 . Unlike equine ATG , rabbit ATG require pre-infusion skin test check hypersensitivity . Methylprednisolone 1 gram give every dose ATG . Additional medication diphenhydramine may give discretion attend physician . Although rare , major toxicity anaphylaxis . Chills , fever , pruritus serum sickness may occur . Regimen allogeneic HSCT Cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) Cyclophosphamide ( CY ) administer intravenously dosage 50 mg/kg four successive day ( use adjust ideal body weight patient 's actual body weight great 100 % ideal body weight ) . The major dose limit side effect high dos cardiac necrosis . Hemorrhagic cystitis occur mediate acrolein metabolite . This prevent co-administration MESNA bladder irrigation . Other notable side effect include nausea , vomit , alopecia , myelosuppression SIADH . Refer institutional manual information administration , toxicity complication . Fludarabine Fludarabine phosphate rapidly dephosphorylated 2-fluoro-ara-A phosphorylated intracellularly deoxycytidine kinase active triphosphate , 2-fluoro-ara-ATP . This metabolite appear act inhibit DNA polymerase alpha , ribonucleotide reductase DNA primase , thus inhibit DNA synthesis . The mechanism action antimetabolite completely characterize may multi-faceted . Phase I study human demonstrate fludarabine phosphate rapidly convert active metabolite , 2-fluoro-ara-A , within minute intravenous infusion . Consequently , clinical pharmacology study focus 2-fluoro-ara-A pharmacokinetics . After five daily dos 25 mg 2-fluoro-ara-AMP/m2 cancer patient infuse 30 minute , 2-fluoro-ara-A concentration show moderate accumulation . During 5-day treatment schedule , 2-fluoro-ara-A plasma trough level increase factor 2 . The terminal half-life 2-fluoro-ara-A estimate approximately 20 hour . In vitro , plasma protein bind fludarabine range 19 % 29 % . CAMPATH Campath-1H humanize fusion protein direct CD52 antigen express lymphocyte , monocyte macrophage . It potent immunosuppressive property effective prevention graft-versus-host disease . 30 mg/day CAMPATH give intravenously 2 hour day -4 , -3 -2 . The commonly reported adverse reaction infusion reaction fever , chill , hypotension , urticaria , nausea , rash , tachycardia , dyspnea ) , cytopenia ( neutropenia , lymphopenia , thrombocytopenia , anemia ) , infection ( CMV viremia , CMV infection , infection ) . In clinical trial , frequency infusion reaction high first week treatment . Other commonly report adverse reaction include vomit , abdominal pain , insomnia anxiety . The commonly report serious adverse reaction cytopenias , infusion reaction , immunosuppression/infections . About 30 minute patient get Campath , he/she give medication ( acetaminophen diphenhydramine , give orally , IV ) help reduce side effect .</detailed_description>
