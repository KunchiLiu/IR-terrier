	<brief_summary>We propose retrospective review patient DiGeorge syndrome undergone cardiac surgery evaluate incidence blood stream and/or surgical site infection . The hypothesis find increase number infection sub-group . We compare incidence infection child similar age diagnosis evaluate variance incidence infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infection DiGeorge Following CHD Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DiGeorge syndrome common genetic disorder frequently result congenital heart defect truncus arteriousus , coarctation aorta , interrupt aortic arch , tetralogy Fallot , pulmonary atresia VSD , several others . The defect usually due deletion long arm chromosome 22 . Approximately 25 % patient DiGeorge congenital heart defect . These patient also vary degree thymic hypoplasia associate T cell dysfunction . They increase risk infection risk opportunistic infection degree T cell dysfunction severe . Children undergoing cardiac surgery risk infection post-operative period , prolong hospital stay increase morbidity mortality . The patient DiGeorge syndrome may higher rate infection due associate immune system dysfunction , however , previously report large group DiGeorge syndrome patient . Children 's Healthcare Atlanta follow 200 patient DiGeorge syndrome , majority previously undergone cardiac surgery . This group patient may benefit extensive antibiotic prophylaxis follow surgery indeed significantly high rate infection , true incidence need determine .</detailed_description>
