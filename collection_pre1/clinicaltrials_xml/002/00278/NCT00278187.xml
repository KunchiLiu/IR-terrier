	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , volociximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Volociximab may also stop growth non-small cell lung cancer block blood flow tumor . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving volociximab together erlotinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give volociximab together erlotinib work treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Volociximab Erlotinib Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate response rate patient locally advance ( stage IIIB ) metastatic ( stage IV ) non-small cell lung cancer treat volociximab erlotinib hydrochloride . Secondary - Evaluate time disease progression duration response patient treat regimen . - Evaluate safety drug regimen patient . - Evaluate pharmacokinetics regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive volociximab IV 30 minute every 2 week oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily 52 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
