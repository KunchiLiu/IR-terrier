	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Combinations biological substance denileukin diftitox may able carry tumor-killing substance directly kidney cancer cell . Interleukin-2 may stimulate white blood cell kill kidney cancer cell . Giving denileukin diftitox together interleukin-2 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase I trial study side effect denileukin diftitox interleukin-2 treating patient metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Denileukin Diftitox Plus High-Dose IL-2 Patients With Metastatic Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine toxic effect denileukin diftitox high-dose interleukin-2 patient metastatic renal cell cancer . Secondary - Perform transform growth factor ( TGF ) -beta promoter TGF-beta receptor genotyping search variant may associate tumor response therapy . - Determine overall response rate ( partial complete ) patient treat regimen . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , pilot study . The first 3 patient enrol study receive high-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) IV 15 minute , 3 time daily , day 1-5 15-19 denileukin diftitox IV 15-60 minute daily day 8-10 . If dose-limiting toxicity occur receive denileukin diftitox , subsequent patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive denileukin diftitox ( high dose first 3 patient enrol study ) IV 15-60 minute daily day -4 -2 high-dose IL-2 IV 15 minute , 3 time daily , day 1-5 15-19 . - Arm II : Patients receive high-dose IL-2 arm I denileukin diftitox ( high dose first 3 patient enrol study ) IV 15-60 minute higher dose daily day 8-10 . All patient may receive additional treatment IL-2 alone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically least 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 13 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
