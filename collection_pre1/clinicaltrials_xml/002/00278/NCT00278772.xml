	<brief_title>Study Divalproex Extended Release Monotherapy Ambulatory Bipolar Spectrum Disorder With Moderate-to-Severe Hypomania Mild Mania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim study evaluate efficacy , tolerability , safety divalproex extend release ( DPX-ER ) monotherapy treatment ambulatory bipolar spectrum disorder moderate-to-severe hypomania mild mania randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , 8-week trial 60 outpatient bipolar disorder , type I , II , NOS DSM-IV-TR criterion . Patients may concurrent depressive anxiety symptom syndrome , psychotic feature substance dependence . The primary outcome measure change hypomanic/manic symptom baseline endpoint . Secondary outcome measure include change depressive anxiety symptom , change global severity illness , concomitant use adjunctive rescue anxiolytic hypnotic medication , adherence study medication , degree severity side effect experience . ) Methods Procedures This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , 8-week study 60 outpatient bipolar disorder type I , II , NOS DSM-IV criterion ( 13 ) , whose overall bipolar illness mild moderately severe define score &gt; 2 &lt; 5 CGI modify bipolar illness [ CGI-BP ] ( 14 ) , also moderate-to-severe hypomania mild mania , define YMRS &gt; 10 &lt; 21 study entry . Subjects may concurrent depressive anxiety symptom syndrome , may psychotic feature . The primary outcome measure change manic symptom measure change Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) ( 17 ) . Secondary outcome measure include Inventory Depressive Symptoms ( IDS ) ( 18 ) , Hamilton Rating Scale Anxiety ( HAM-A ) ( 20 ) , Clinical Global Improvement Scale modify Bipolar Disorder ( CGI-BP ) , ( 16 ) Global Assessment Functioning Scale ( GAF ) , Sheehan Disability Scale ( DSD ) ( 18 ) . Medication Dosing : Divalproex ER administer initial dose 15mg/kg/day titrated upward dose consider optimal investigator base subject 's clinical response adverse event , exceed 30mg/kg/day . As need ( prn ) use lorazepam ( 0.5-2.0mg/day ) allow management affective symptom first two week study ; prn lorazpam ( 0.5-1.0mg/day ) allow next 2 week ; subsequently ( final 4 week study ) , lorazepam permit . Zaleplon ( 10-20mg/day ) allow management insomnia throughout study . Screening Visit ( ) : The Screening Period last minimum 3 maximum 30 day . At first screen visit ( Visit 0 ) , informed consent obtain . The Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) perform establish whether patient meet DSM-IV criterion bipolar disorder I , II , NOS . The YMRS ( 17 ) , IDS ( 18 ) , CGI-BP ( 16 ) perform establish presence severity bipolar affective symptom . If subject currently psychotropic medication , taper . Subjects need psychotropic medication least 1 week prior randomization , 2 week take fluoxetine 4 week receive depot antipsychotic medication . Mood chart administer subject help follow symptom . Subjects meet study staff weekly period stop previous psychiatric medication start study medication . Medical history review , physical exam perform , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) laboratory study ( Complete Metabolic Profile , Liver Function Tests ( LFT 's ) , CBC diff + platelet , Urinalysis ) obtain . Based evaluation , determine whether subject meet entry criterion ; subject meet criterion continue screen process . Baseline Visit ( last Screening Visit ) : At baseline ( Visit 1 ) , subject whose screen evaluation continue meet inclusion/exclusion criterion may enter study randomize . Baseline rating obtain , include YMRS , IDS , HAM-A , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI-BP ) . The subject must evaluate modest-to-severe hypomania mild mania least 2 occasion least 3 day apart enter randomized phase . Also , subject 's bipolar disorder must evaluate mildly moderately severe least 2 occasion least 3 day apart , define CGI-BP &gt; 2 &lt; 5 , patient enter randomized phase . Subjects also evaluate Inventory Depressive Symptoms ( IDS ) , Hamilton Scale Anxiety ( HAM-A ) , Global Assessment Functioning Scale - clinician rat ( GAF-C ) , Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS ) . Blood pressure , pulse , height , weight measure . Study medication dispense Physician Investigator form 500mg capsule . The dose start range divalproex ER 15 mg/kg/day . Treatment Period : Study visit occur every week first four week treatment , every 2 week 8th week treatment . It expect divalproex ER adjust optimal dose first month treatment . The following procedure complete visit . 1 . Collect unused divalproex ER perform study drug accountability . A subject 's unused study medication redispensed back subject . 2 . Perform YMRS , IDS , CGI-BP , HAM-A , GAF-C , SDS rating . 3 . Assess record adverse event . 4 . Obtain blood pressure , pulse , weight . 5 . Record concomitant medication use ( mood chart ) 6 . Adjust divalproex ER dose ( necessary ) dispense study drug . 7 . At study visit 1,2 , 4 , laboratory obtain ( complete metabolic profile , LFT 's , CBC differential platelet , urinalysis , serum valproate level ) . Final Evaluation ( week 8 ) : The following evaluation conduct completion , early withdrawal , 8-week treatment phase . All psychiatric evaluation final study procedure ( include repeat physical exam , EKG , laboratory study ) complete prior discontinuation divalproex ER . 1 . Collect unused divalproex ER perform study drug accountability . 2 . Assess record adverse event . 3 . Obtain blood pressure , pulse , weight , determine BMI . 4 . Perform YMRS , IDS , CGI-BP , HAM-A , GAF-C SDS rating . 5 . Perform physical examination . 6 . Obtain laboratory ( Complete Metabolic Profile , LFT 's , CBC with/diff + platelet , Urinalysis , serum Valproate level ) . 7 . Repeat EKG . 8 . Record concomitant medication use ( mood chart ) 9 . Adjust divalproex ER dose ( necessary ) prescribe drug ( subject respond chooses continue divalproex ER ) , dispense divalproex ER taper discontinuation ( subject respond subject chooses discontinue divalproex ER reason ) .</detailed_description>
