	<detailed_description>Study Overview This trial randomise , single-center , placebo-controlled , double blind , parallel group study patient asthma symptomatic inhaled steroid . Patient Population Patients eligible study diagnosis moderate asthma define American Thoracic Society criterion &gt; 1 year . These patient take inhaled steroid dose equivalent &lt; /= 400µg &lt; /= 2000µg per day beclomethasone diproprionate oral steroid medication . Patients take additional oral steroid require stop oral medication least one month prior pre-screening . Many patient receive long-acting beta2-agonists therapy discontinue 48h start run-in . In addition , follow therapy allow : 1 ) anticholinergic ; 2 ) theophylline ; 3 ) oral beta2-agonists ; 4 ) antihistamine ; 5 ) inhale cromolyn sodium nedocromil ; 6 ) leukotriene antagonist . Patients use prohibited medication ask discontinue use 2 week prior screen examination . During washout period , patient keep clinical diary remain contact clinical research center . Eligible patient screen maintain stable dos normal inhaled steroid dose equivalent &gt; /= 400 µg &lt; /= 2000µg per day beclomethasone diproprionate able use short-acting beta2-agonists symptom relief . Screening At screening , eligible patient baseline screen FEV1 &gt; /= 60 &lt; /= 90 % predict least 4 hour last usage short-acting beta2-agonist . Patients reversible airway obstruction : &gt; /= 12 % increase FEV1 comparison baseline show within 30 minute take 200 µg salbutamol . If airway reversibility demonstrate visit , patient eligible re-testing . Reversible airway disease may demonstrate time screen start run-in period . The 2 4 week run-in period start immediately demonstration reversible lung disease . Patients also skin test standard battery bronchial allergen perform screen . Patients purify protein derivative ( PPD ) skin test chest radiograph prior first infusion . Patients evidence either latent active tuberculosis ( TB ) enrol . Run-in Period Following acceptable screen test patient complete baseline run-in 2 4 week duration prior study start . During period patient require keep symptom diary record baseline lung function parameter use electronic spirometer . As , patient maintain normal inhaled steroid dose equivalent &gt; /= 400 µg &lt; /= 2000µg per day beclomethasone diproprionate able use short-acting beta2-agonists symptom relief . No asthma medication allow period rest study . Use , non-asthma , medication review Investigator allow his/her discretion provide stable dose regimen maintain possible throughout study . Baseline Visit ( day -1 ) The day first drug administration , patient attend clinical research unit diary card review . In order enter study patient must mean total daily symptom score &gt; /= 4 measure last 7 day baseline run-in period [ A symptom scale score range 0 ( =symptom free ) 3 ( =severe symptom ) use , 6 question , total maximum daily symptom score 18 , see appendix D ) ] and/or &gt; /= 10 % &lt; 30 % diurnal variation PEFR measure least 2 7 day period . Diurnal variation PEFR define morning evening PEFR value ; morning evening PEFR determine 3 immediately consecutive occasion high value take . The calculation diurnal variation base : [ ( high ( pm ) PEFR- low ( pm ) PEFR ) / high ( pm ) PEFR x 100 ] . In eligible patient , follow pharmacodynamic assessment make : breath NO level ( non-nasal ) breath condensate , pulmonary function test ( FEV1 , FVC PEFR ) , sputum induction marker inflammation , blood sample collection measurement marker inflammation . Study Treatments Patients randomise 1:1 ratio treatment infliximab placebo , respectively . PRI provide randomisation list . At t=0 week , patient either receive 5 mg/kg infliximab ( Group I , n=20 ) placebo ( Group II , n=20 ) . Subsequently , infliximab placebo infuse week 2 6 . Throughout study period week 12 , patient allow use inhaled corticosteroid stable dose regimen . Salbutamol , short-acting beta2-agonist , allow necessary relieve symptom . During study , two treatment group define : Group I : Infliximab 5 mg/kg + short-acting beta2-agonist ( need ) + inhaled corticosteroid ( equivalent &gt; /= 400 µg &lt; /= 2000µg per day beclomethasone diproprionate ) . Group II : Placebo + short-acting beta2-agonist ( need ) + inhaled corticosteroid ( equivalent &gt; /= 400 µg &lt; /= 2000µg per day beclomethasone diproprionate ) . Study Evaluations Throughout study , start baseline run-in period , patient require daily record PEFR FEV1 ( morning evening ) , short-acting beta2-agonist use clinical symptom use diary card . Mean weekly score calculate parameter start week -1 week 12 . Prior administration study drug week 0 , addition , week 1 , 8 12 , follow pharmacodynamic assessment make : breath NO level , breath condensate leukotriene B4 &amp; C4 , pulmonary function test ( FEV1 , FVC PEFR ) , sputum induction marker inflammation ( week 0 , 1 8 ) level marker inflammation peripheral blood . In addition , week 2 6 , breath NO level measure pulmonary function test perform . Safety Safety evaluation include measurement vital sign immediately ( 2 hour ) infusion study medication assessment adverse event ( AEs ) evaluation visit . Additional vital sign lung function measurement perform immediately infusion = 1 2 hour post dose . Routine laboratory test perform screening , day -1 week 2 , 6 , 8 12 . During study , medical monitor regularly review safety data . Follow-up During last visit week 12 clinical research center , follow-up examination , include physical examination blood urine chemistry perform .</detailed_description>
