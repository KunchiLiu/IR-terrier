	<brief_summary>This study design examine whether treat patient lupus high dose cyclophosphamide together rATG/rituximab ( drug reduce function immune system ) , follow return previously collect stem cell result improvement disease . Stem cell undeveloped cell capacity grow mature blood cell , normally circulate blood stream . The purpose intense chemotherapy destroy cell immune system may cause disease . The purpose stem cell infusion produce normal immune system longer attack body . The study purpose examine whether treatment result improvement lupus disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mobilization Participants administer Cyclophosphamide 2.0 g/m2 200 ml normal saline ( NS ) 1 hour . Hydration 0.9 NS approximately 100-250-ml/ hour begin 4 hour prior cyclophosphamide continue 24 hour termination cyclophosphamide . Urine output approximately great 100 ml/hour maintain . G-CSF administer subcutaneously 5-10 mcg/kg/day start 5 day termination cyclophosphamide administration . After absolute neutrophil count great 1000/ul hematological nadir , leukapheresis use continuous flow blood cell separator initiate . A 10-15 liter apheresis perform unless stop earlier clinical judgment toxicity ( e.g. , numbness , tetany ) . The G-CSF continue apheresis discontinue . If necessary , platelet transfuse great 60,000/ul prior apheresis . Conditioning Regimen Mesna : 50mg/kg/day x 4 day give intravenously 24 hour . Cyclophosphamide : 50 mg/kg/day x 4 day ( less ideal actual weight ) give intravenously 1 hour 250 cc normal saline day -5 -2 . Hydration : approximately 50-200cc/hour adult begin 6 hour cyclophosphamide continue 24 hour last cyclophosphamide dose . Hydration rate need individually adjust daily weight maintain dry weight count . BID weight obtain . Warning : Participants renal insufficiency prone volume overload . Early institution ultrafiltration dialysis recommend . Rabbit ATG 0.5mg/kg give IV day -5 , 1.0mg/kg give day -4 , 1.5mg/kg give IV day -3 , -2 , -1 ( dose adjustment ) . It give 10 hour . Premedicate Solumedrol 250mg IV , acetaminophen 650mg po qd diphenhydramine 25mg 30 minute infusion . Rituximab 500mg/day give IV day -6 +1 . At first dose ( D-6 ) , rituximab infusion start 50mg/h escalate infusion rate 50mg every 30minutes maximum 400mg/h . Starting second dose ( day -4 , -2 +1 ) . IV infusion start 100mg/h escalate infusion rate 100mg every 30minutes maximum 400mg/h . Premedicate Solumedrol 250mg IV , acetaminophen 650mg po qd diphenhydramine 25mg 30 minute infusion day -6 +1 . Premedicate acetaminophen 650mg po qd diphenhydramine 25mg 30 minute infusion day -4 -2 . Stem Cell Reinfusion Previously collect stem cell reinfused day 0 note Table 4 . The stem cell infuse approximately 20 minute central venous catheter ( e.g. , PICC line ) . Following stem cell reinfusion , routine daily lab obtain include CBC , chemistry panel , liver function test . Antibiotics blood transfusion administer required clinical judgment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ages 15 60 year old Meet least 4 11 American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) Classification criterion SLE ( see Appendix 16.2 ) Meet one follow five : 1 . For lupus nephritis , participant must fail pulse cyclophosphamide ( 500 1000 mg/m2 monthly minimum 6 month ) . Failure define meeting criterion consider BILAG renal category A . 2 . For visceral organ involvement nephritis , participant must BILAG cardiovascular/respiratory category A , vasculitis category A , neurologic category A must fail least 3 month oral IV cyclophosphamide corticosteroid dependent . Steroid dependence define least 3 month steroid therapy inability wean corticosteroid le 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent . 3 . For cytopenias immune mediate , participant must BILAG hematologic category A . Participants must fail corticosteroid ( either oral prednisone &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day 6 month pulse methylprednisolone least one cycle three day ) , least one following : azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day least 3 month , mycophenolate mofetil 2 gram daily 3 month , cyclophosphamide intravenously orally least 3 month , cyclosporine least 3 mg/kg/day least 3 month , danazol least 3 month , splenectomy . 4 . For mucocutaneous disease , participant must meet BILAG mucocutaneous category A , unable wean prednisone le 0.5 mg/kg/day 6 month obvious cushingoid habitus , receive least one following : azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day least 3 month , methotrexate 15mg/week least 3 month , cyclophosphamide intravenously orally least 3 month , cyclosporine least 3 mg/kg/day least 3 month . 5 . For arthritis/myositis , participant must meet BILAG musculoskeletal category A , unable wean prednisone le 0.5 mg/kg/day 6 month obvious cushingoid habitus , receive least one following : azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day least 3 month , methotrexate 15mg/ week least 3 month , cyclophosphamide intravenously orally least 3 month , cyclosporine least 3 mg/kg/day least 3 month . Able give inform consent . If indication HSCT nephritis , renal biopsy must demonstrate potential reversible ( nonfibrotic ) component indicate successful participant would likely permanently dialysisdependent transplant . Since BILAG one multiple index SLE , patient may also candidate despite prior immune suppression therapy describe , patient still active immune suppression ( 10mg day prednisone ) . Patients SLE whose major manifestation Antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS ) may candidate without prior immune suppression therapy visceral organ thrombotic embolic event despite anticoagulation . Patients SLE whose major manifestation Antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS ) may candidate without prior immune suppression therapy visceral organ thrombotic embolic event despite anticoagulation . HIV positive Ongoing malignancy except localize basal cell squamous skin cancer . Other malignancy participant judge cured local surgical therapy , head neck cancer , stage I II breast cancer consider individual basis investigator final screening participant qualification . Positive pregnancy test , inability unwillingness pursue effective mean birth control , failure willingly accept comprehend irreversible sterility side effect therapy . Psychiatric illness mental deficiency make compliance treatment inform consent impossible . DLCO &lt; 45 % predict unless attribute active lupus . Resting LVEF &lt; 40 % unless attribute active lupus . Known hypersensitivity E Coli derive protein . Transaminases great 2 time normal unless attribute active lupus . Positive tuberculosis skin test Any active infection Any comorbid illness opinion investigator would jeopardize ability subject tolerate study .
