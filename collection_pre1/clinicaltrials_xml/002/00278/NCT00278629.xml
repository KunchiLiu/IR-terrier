	<brief_summary>Chronic inflammatory demyelinate polyneuropathy disease believe due immune cell , cell normally protect body , attack nerve body . As result , affected nerve fail respond , respond weakly , stimuli cause numbing , tingle , pain , progressive muscle weakness.The likelihood progression disease high . This study design examine whether treat patient high dose cyclophosphamide ( drug reduces function immune system ) ATG ( protein kill immune cell think cause disease ) , follow return previously collect blood stem cell stop progression CIDP . Stem cell undeveloped cell capacity grow mature blood cell , normally circulate blood stream . The purpose high dose cyclophosphamide ATG destroy cell immune system . The purpose stem cell infusion evaluate whether treatment produce normal immune system longer attack body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selection Regimen Immunosuppressive Therapy Cyclophosphamide ATG common condition regimen two decade experience treatment aplastic anemia , use safely without report mortality treatment autoimmune diseases systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis.Cy / ATG associate late malignancy cataract . Both cyclophosphamide anti-thymocyte globulin ( horse rabbit ATG ) potent immunosuppressive agent . ATG contribute additional immunosuppression without additional cytotoxicity . ATG give shortly pre-transplant contribute elimination host T lymphocytes survive cyclophosphamide SLE , autoimmune disease responsive cyclophosphamide , respond well CY / ATG condition regimen , recently find patient either SLE neuromyelitis optica respond faster may durable remission regimen `` rituxan sandwich '' rituxan infuse standard cytoxan rATG . For reason , `` rituxan sandwich '' condition regimen utilized study . 5.2 Method Harvesting Stem Cells Based experience pilot study , current protocol mobilize stem cell granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) collect stem cell apheresis , subsequent bone marrow harvest perform need supplement peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) . Based experience autoimmune flare patient receive G-CSF alone mobilization , patient mobilize cyclophosphamide 2.0 g/m2 G-CSF 5-10 mcg/kg . 5.3 Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide ( CY ) active agent patient wide variety malignancy . It use frequently therapy lymphoid malignancy potent immunosuppressive activity . It frequently use cytotoxic immunosuppressive agent patient undergoing marrow transplant treatment patient autoimmune disease . It alkylating agent require hepatic metabolism active metabolite , phosphoramide mustard acrolein . These active metabolite react nucleophilic group . It available oral intravenous preparation . Bioavailability 90 % give orally . The half-life parent compound 5.3 hour adult , half-life major metabolite phosphoramide mustard 8.5 hour . Liver renal dysfunction lead prolong serum half-life . CY administer intravenously dosage 50 mg/kg 4 successive day ( use adjust ideal body weight patient 's actual body weight great 100 % ideal body weight ) . The major dose limit side effect high dos cardiac necrosis . Hemorrhagic cystitis occur mediate acrolein metabolite.This prevent co-administration MESNA bladder irrigation . Other notable side effect include nausea , vomit , alopecia , myelosuppression SIADH . Refer institutional manual information administration , toxicity complication . 5.4 Rabbit-Derived Anti-Thymocyte Globulin ( rATG ) Rabbit-derived anti-human thymocyte globulin ( rATG ) gamma globulin preparation obtain hyperimmune serum rabbit immunize human thymocytes . rATG use predominately solid organ transplant immunosuppressive regimen . rATG predominantly lymphocyte-specific immunosuppressive agent . It contain antibody specific antigen commonly find surface T cell . After bind surface molecule , rATG promotes depletion T cell circulation mechanism include opsonization complement-assisted , antibody-dependent , cell-mediated cytotoxicity . The plasma half-life range 1.5 12 day . rATG administer intravenously dose 0.5 mg/kg recipient body weight day -6 dose 1.0 mg/kg recipient body weight day -5 , -4 , -3 , -2 , -1 . Unlike equine ATG , rabbit ATG require pre-infusion skin test check hypersensitivity . Methylprednisolone 250 mg give every dose rATG . Additional medication diphenhydramine may give discretion attend physician . Although rare , major toxicity anaphylaxis ; chill , fever , pruritus serum sickness may occur . 5.5 Rituxan Rituximab chimeric monoclonal antibody use treatment B cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , B cell leukemia , numerous autoimmune disorder . The recommended adult dosage patient low grade follicular NHL 375 mg/m2 infuse intravenously adult patient autoimmune disease standard 500 mg generally give intravenously . The infusion may give weekly interval four total dosage every 2 week repeat 2-3 time . Acetaminophen diphenhydramine hydrochoride give 30-60 minute infusion help reduce side effect . If give retreatment dosage . The majority side effect occur first infusion drug . Some common side effect include dizziness , feel swell tongue throat , fever chill , flush face , headache , itching , nausea vomiting , runny nose , shortness breath , skin rash , fatigue .</detailed_description>
