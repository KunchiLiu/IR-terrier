	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory tract infection among common problem childhood , particularly among infant child young 3 year , account antibiotic prescription child . Most infection self-limited require medical intervention ; however , symptom overlap significantly severe viral bacterial infection . At hospital Emergency Department ( ED ) , medical assessment , prescription antibiotic ( unnecessarily infection viral ) , series investigation ( e.g. , blood work , X-rays ) often take place decision patient management possible hospital admission make . Such procedure lead intense use human health resource ( nursing , laboratory radiology staff ) hospital facility . The literature suggest prompt single viral diagnosis improve decision-making . To knowledge , no-one perform controlled trial examine impact rapid , multi-viral detection test like VIRAP , impact time test , management child flu-like illness ED . Our objective determine use new viral detection program , VIRAP , rapid test viral respiratory infection right triage improve patient management resource use ED . We test hypothesis availability VIRAP triage support rapid diagnosis viral infection child BCCH ( ) reduce wait time ED ; ( ii ) improve decision make regard diagnostic investigation specimen collection ; ( iii ) decrease antibiotic prescription .

	<detailed_description>Description Project : Background : Acute viral respiratory tract infection among common infectious problem childhood first five year life , particularly among infant young 2 year age . Although majority infection require medical attention self-limited nature , worry parent commonly bring child emergency department ( ED ) evaluation ( average 2500 children/winter ) . EDs choke point health care system , especially peaks annual influenza season respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) season . Without prompt specific viral diagnosis child present ED febrile respiratory illness , see physician , child may undergo constellation precautionary diagnostic test ( septic work , CXR ) prescribe antibiotic unnecessarily . These intervention lead prolong ED stay ( average 180min +/-120 min ) , intense use human health resource ( nursing , laboratory radiology staff ) result significant cost direct indirect health care system , well time lose child family contribute antimicrobial resistance . The precise etiology viral infection episode determine use rapid screen program VIRAP ( nasopharyngeal wash rapid direct viral antigen detection via immunofluorescence ) . At moment VIRAP physician order test , do child see physician , usually child already wait significant length time , wait result test . Hypothesis : Rapid diagnosis viral infection VIRAP initiate nurse triage wit result available ED physician time assessment may influence decision make respect additional investigation therefore reduce amount wait time ED , well decrease antibiotic prescription . This would ultimately result improved effectiveness service provision child febrile respiratory illness turn shorten wait time child ED . Health care cost reduction minimise unnecessary diagnostic test perform antibiotic prescription also expect . Study design : We propose conduct single centre , open label , randomize control trial compare outcome patient undergo VIRAP triage v routine ED admission protocol . During month December 2005 April , Dec2006 April 2007 , eligible patient base inclusion exclusion enrol triage randomize 1:1 ratio either undergo NPW VIRAP result available treat physician time assessment routine admit protocol ED await physician assessment without prior investigation . Criteria : Patients age 3-36 month admit BCCH ED fever ( ≥38.5 0C measure ED document accompany parent ) least one : cough , runny nose , nasal congestion sore throat eligible enrolment . Excluded study patient immuno-compromised , underlying chronic severe respiratory condition ( cystic fibrosis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ) chronic heart condition ( uncorrected cyanotic heart lesion , prosthetic valve ) , prior assessment ED department current illness . Only one child per family enrol . End point : The duration stay ED ( assessment discharge , include time wait investigation review result physician ) primary endpoint . Secondary endpoint include whether investigation follow assessment ( blood test , radiographs urine test ) order whether study patient prescribe antibiotic .</detailed_description>
