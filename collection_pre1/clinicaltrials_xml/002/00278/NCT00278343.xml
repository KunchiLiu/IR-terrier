	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Persistent , Recurrent , Refractory Advanced Ovarian Epithelial , Peritoneal Cavity , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Objective tumor response rate ( complete plus partial response plus stable disease &gt; 16 week define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) woman recurrent refractory advance ovarian primary peritoneal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Time disease progression , median survival time , duration overall cancer antigen ( CA ) -125 response . OUTLINE : Patients receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
