	<brief_summary>Severe peripheral vascular disease legs cause narrow blood vessel legs , keep blood flow adequately vessel . This study design examine whether treat patient previously collect blood stem cell improve blood flow severely affect leg . Blood stem cell undeveloped cell capacity grow mature blood cell , normally circulate blood stream .</brief_summary>
