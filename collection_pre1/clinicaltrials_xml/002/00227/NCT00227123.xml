	<brief_title>A Randomized Control Trial Comparing Quetiapine Risperidone Bipolar Disorder With Stimulant Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder may associate high rate substance abuse psychiatric illness . Studies suggest substance abuse person bipolar disorder lifetime prevalence rate high 60 % report cocaine abuse high 30 % . Comorbid substance abuse person bipolar disorder associate increased hospitalization , poor psychiatric recovery treatment response patient bipolar disorder alone . Thus , therapeutic agent may enhance prognosis improve psychiatric outcome , reduce stimulant craving , increase treatment retention considerable interest . In previous study conduct lab , find conventional neuroleptic agent associated increase depressive symptom significant increase stimulant craving . These result mirror preclinical animal data show conventional neuroleptic ( i.e.haloperidol ) high dopamine receptor bind affinity actually increase cocaine self-administration rat monkey . These result clinically relevant person bipolar disorder abuse cocaine drug often receive high dos conventional neuroleptic without cocaine drug abuse . In contrast conventional neuroleptic therapy , atypical antipsychotic ( i.e . quetiapine , risperidone ) , decrease self-administration cocaine . The receptor bind profile atypical antipsychotic broadly vary although agent drug class know serotonin-dopamine antagonist . Quetiapine 'moderate ' dopamine binding , risperidone 'high ' dopamine receptor bind property similar conventional neuroleptic agent . Thus , hypothesis quetiapine may efficacious agent risperidone treat bipolar mood symptom attenuate drug craving use .</detailed_description>
