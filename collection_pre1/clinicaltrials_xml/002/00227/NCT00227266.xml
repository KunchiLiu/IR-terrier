	<detailed_description>This multi-center phase II trial combine regimen oral valproic acid ( VPA ) carnitine patient Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) 2 17 year age . Cohort 1 double-blind placebo-controlled randomize intention treat protocol SMA `` sitter '' 2 - 8 year age . Subjects undergo two baseline assessment 4 6 week period , randomize treatment placebo next six month . All subject place active treatment subsequent six month period . Cohort 2 open label protocol SMA `` stander walker '' 3 - 17 year age explore responsiveness efficacy outcome . Subjects undergo two baseline assessment four six week period , follow one year active treatment VPA carnitine . Outcome measure perform every 3 6 month , include blood chemistry , functional testing , pulmonary function testing , electrophysiological evaluation , PedsQL quality life assessment , quantitative assessment survival motor neuron ( SMN ) mRNA blood sample , growth vital sign parameter . Six center enroll total 90 patient .</detailed_description>
