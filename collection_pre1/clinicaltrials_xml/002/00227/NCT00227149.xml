Kraus , G. Teuber , NN , NN ( MPsych ) , M. Scheurlen Questions : - Neurocognitive psychiatric change induce interferon alfa-2b therapy patient chronic hepatitis C - fully reversible long-term follow-up end antiviral treatment ? - At least 12 month end antiviral treatment - neurocognitive mood-related parameter even significantly improve compare pretreatment value ? Is possibly true patient successful virus eradication ? - At least 12 month end antiviral treatment , significant difference patient without sustained virological response respect neurocognitive performance , emotional state quality life ? - In absence clinically significant liver damage patient chronic hepatitis C - mere presence hepatitis C virus significant influence neurocognitive attentional performance ? - Does study data support additional indication antiviral therapy chronic hepatitis C ? In case successful virus eradication , emotional state - - neurocognitive performance significantly improve even absence severe liver damage ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This long-term evaluation follow-up study neurocognitive performance emotional state patient chronic hepatitis C infection former ( peg ) interferon alfa-2b-based therapy . M.R . Kraus , G. Teuber , NN , NN ( MPsych ) , M. Scheurlen Questions : - Neurocognitive psychiatric change induce interferon alfa-2b therapy patient chronic hepatitis C - fully reversible long-term follow-up end antiviral treatment ? - At least 12 month end antiviral treatment - neurocognitive mood-related parameter even significantly improve compare pretreatment value ? Is possibly true patient successful virus eradication ? - At least 12 month end antiviral treatment , significant difference patient without sustained virological response respect neurocognitive performance , emotional state quality life ? - Can result current previous study confirm alternative / additional psychometric instrument specify subsample ? ( Fatigue Impact Scale ; FIS-D , SF-36 ) - In absence clinically significant liver damage patient chronic hepatitis C - mere presence hepatitis C virus significant influence neurocognitive attentional performance ? - Does study data support additional indication antiviral therapy chronic hepatitis C ? In case successful virus eradication , emotional state - - neurocognitive performance significantly improve even absence severe liver damage ? Methods : - Multifactorial analysis test result : pre- vs. post-therapy ; sustain virological response vs. nonresponse/relapse . - Psychometric evaluation instrument / psychometric questionnaire ( HADS-D , SCL-90-R , Subsample : SF-36 , FIS-D ) - Evaluation neurocognitive performance Test battery Attentional Performance ( TAP ) - Evaluation prospective , longitudinal study design . Planned sample size / sample size consideration - N = 150 patient ( hepatitis C patient longitudinal study design : t1 [ onset interferon therapy ] … t5 [ least 12 month end antiviral treatment ] Power calculation / power consideration : - Given : 2-factorial design ( time course x SVR ) ; type I error = 0.050 ; type II error = 0.20 ( power = 0.80 ) - usually assume clinical trial . - With respect independent factor SVR ( `` sustain virological response '' , 2 factor level ) , optimum / optimal sample size range 42 ( large effect size = 0.8 ) 102 ( medium effect size = 0.5 ) . Smaller effect size - accord previous work field - appear bear clinical relevance . - ( Pairwise comparison dependent sample [ e.g . pre- vs. post-therapy pre-therapy vs. long-term follow-up ] require even small optimal sample size range 16 43 large medium effect size . ) Patient recruitment : - Patients chronic hepatitis C infection therapy ( peg ) interferon alfa-2b . - Patients informed write consent ( respect ) long-term follow-up psychiatric side effect neurocognitive performance . - Patients baseline monitor neuropsychiatric symptom neurocognitive performance .</detailed_description>
