	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give gemcitabine together docetaxel effective give gemcitabine alone second-line therapy treat uterine soft tissue leiomyosarcoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study gemcitabine docetaxel see well work compare gemcitabine alone second-line therapy treat patient metastatic relapse , unresectable uterine soft tissue leiomyosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With Without Docetaxel Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Relapsed , Unresectable Uterine Soft Tissue Leiomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare anti-tumor activity , term objective response rate , patient metastatic relapse , unresectable uterine soft tissue leiomyosarcoma treat gemcitabine v without docetaxel second-line therapy . Secondary - Compare progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare response duration overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare tolerability dose intensity regimens patient . - Determine biological marker predictive value response regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord location leiomyosarcoma ( uterine v soft tissue ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 2-8 course . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine day 1 8 docetaxel day 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2-8 course . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A minimum 80 patient ( 40 per stratum treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
