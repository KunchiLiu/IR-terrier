	<brief_title>Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors Improve Cognitive Function Overall Rehabilitation After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment common result stroke detrimental recovery . It negatively affect mental physical functioning , thereby complicate rehabilitation process . Although much research target effect long-term cognitive impairment stroke , little research do examine incidence course cognitive impairment first three month follow stroke . These first three month important term regain function . Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor beneficial sufferer vascular dementia Alzheimer 's disease . They may also useful pharmacologic intervention enhance post-stroke rehabilitation . This study compare effectiveness two acetylcholinesterase inhibitor , galantamine donepezil , improve cognitive function overall rehabilitation elderly stroke survivor . Participants open label study randomly assign receive either galantamine donepezil 12 week . Participants assign receive galantamine receive 4 mg twice day 4 week , 8 mg twice day next 4 week , 12 mg twice day remainder study . Participants assign receive donepezil receive 5 mg twice day 6 week , 10 mg twice day next 6 week . Functional independence measure baseline Weeks 2 12 . In addition , pre-stroke level functional independence obtain structure interview participant family . Participants also monitor sign depression medication side effect throughout study .</detailed_description>
