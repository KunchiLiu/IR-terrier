	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , pemetrexed disodium carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give pemetrexed disodium together carboplatin work treat patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium Carboplatin Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine complete partial response rate patient previously untreated , extensive-stage small cell lung cancer treat pemetrexed disodium carboplatin . Secondary - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine , preliminarily , survival patient treat regimen . - Determine , preliminarily , response rate patient 70 year older treat regimen . - Determine , preliminarily , toxicity regimen patient 70 year old . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord age ( &lt; 70 year vs ≥ 70 year ) . Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients develop progressive disease CNS may receive whole-brain radiotherapy continue chemotherapy completion whole-brain radiotherapy 6 course . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 77 patient least 46 &lt; 70 year age least 24 ≥ 70 year age ) accrue study within 20-26 month .</detailed_description>
