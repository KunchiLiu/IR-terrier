	<brief_summary>The objective study determine extent magnitude pharmacokinetic drug interaction mycophenolate mofetil ( MFF ) ( Css condition ) presence iron renal transplant recipient . A two phase pharmacokinetic study conduct determine bioavailability MMF ( steady state , Css , condition ) presence two commonly prescribe iron formulation ( polysaccharide iron complex sustain release ferrous sulfate ) renal transplant recipient . This study evaluate valuable clinical information help well guide appropriate utilization follow formulation dose strategy : 1 . Polysaccharide iron complex concomitant administration MMF , 2 . Sustained release ferrous sulfate concomitant administration MMF , 3 . Dose separation ( 2 hour ) MMF iron ( polysaccharide iron complex sustain release [ S.R . ] ferrous sulfate )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CellCept/Iron Study : The Iron Ion-Mycophenolate Mofetil Chelation Complex Interaction Renal Allograft Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following oral administration , MMF rapidly absorb presystemically hydrolyze active form MPA liver . It metabolize glucuronyl transferase inactive metabolite mycophenolic acid glucuronide ( MPAG ) . MPA MPAG also undergo significant enterohepatic recirculation process , think contribute secondary peak serum concentration . Pharmacokinetic study healthy volunteer demonstrate bioavailability ~94 % . Previous study show many concomitantly administer medication include magnesium aluminum contain antacid cholestyramine , significantly impair bioavailability decrease serum MPA AUCs 37 % 40 % , respectively . However , potentially significant drug interaction involve MMF , iron may clinically significant consequence . A large portion transplant population , particularly renal allograft recipient , experience anemia require iron supplementation . A single dose pharmacokinetic study conduct seven healthy volunteer evaluate effect concomitant iron ( delayed release preparation ) administration absorption MMF . This study report significant ( 89.7 % ) decrease AUC among patient receive concomitant iron MMF . Although study provide valuable information , fail address several clinically pertinent question transplant clinician include : 1. potential impact steady state MPA kinetics transplant patient , 2. effect immediate release iron preparation compare sustained release iron product , 3. effect time dose relative administration MMF .</detailed_description>
