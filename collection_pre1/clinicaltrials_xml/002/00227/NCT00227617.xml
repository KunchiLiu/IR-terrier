	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth neuroendocrine tumor block blood flow tumor . Giving combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect give combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab see well work treat patient advanced neuroendocrine tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ) bevacizumab patient advance neuroendocrine tumor . - Determine best overall response rate patient treat regimen . Secondary - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine time treatment failure progression patient treat regimen . - Determine biochemical marker response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , pilot study . Patients stratify accord tumor type ( carcinoid v islet cell v poorly differentiate neuroendocrine ) . Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 46-48 hour begin day 1 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 39-102 patient ( 13-34 per stratum ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
