	<detailed_description>The surgical process major stressor psychological distress , tissue trauma , lack activity , quasi-starvation produce immediate systemic change short- long-term effect activity quality life . However , mount evidence many negative immediate effect surgery pain , fatigue , weakness amenable intervention . If proper intervention carry , symptom may readily control allow faster recovery early home discharge . But effect surgery felt far beyond immediate convalescent period patient feel fatigued many week delay return usual function reduces quality life . Thus , would great practical benefit way improve post-surgery physical function quality life could identify . Traditionally effort make improve recovery process intervene post-operative period . However , post-operative period may opportune time introduce intervention accelerate recovery . Many surgical patient concerned perturb healing process well depress anxious await treatment . The pre-operative period may emotionally salient time intervene factor contribute recovery . The process enhance functional capacity individual enable withstand incoming stressor term prehabilitation The purpose study address follow research question : Among person schedule colorectal surgery , pre-operative program aerobic muscle strength training ( prehabilitation ) compare standard peri-operative educational protocol affect functional exercise capacity health-related quality life ? The trial single blind , stratify ( cancer diagnosis ) , randomize , two-group ( prehabilitation standard care ) , parallel design . Both group receive peri-operative education program . In conformity current practice , subject also advise nutritional support preoperative period . Persons albumin &lt; 38 gm./l receive adequate supply protein calorie nutritional supplement bar . In addition standard care , prehabilitation group prescribe program exercise training consist daily stationary cycle start intervention day prior surgery ( minimum 3 week ) combine individualized program muscle strength training . Both group evaluate exercise tolerance , walk capacity health emotional status enrolment 3 three week train well 4 week , 8 week 24 week ( 6 month ) post-surgery . The main outcome measure 6 Minute Walk Test - valid reliable measure functional walking capacity . The estimator effect proportion people group , 8 week post-surgery , achieve exceed baseline value test ( Â± 20m ) . The propose sample size 200 . This base 80 % power detect difference 22 % proportion recover baseline value ( 40 % standard 62 % prehabilitation ) . The result trial use inform practitioner patient alike benefit ( risk ) exercise prepare surgery .</detailed_description>
