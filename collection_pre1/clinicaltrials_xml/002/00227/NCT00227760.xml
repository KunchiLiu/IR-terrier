	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Kidney Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical benefit rate ( objective response rate rate stable disease least 4 month ) AZD2171 ( cediranib maleate ) give patient progressive unresectable , recurrent metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . II . To assess duration response stable disease , progression free , median overall survival rate , safety tolerability AZD2171 . III . To measure baseline post treatment level soluble marker angiogenic growth factor receptor well level circulate endothelial cell , correlate clinical outcome . IV . To assess change blood flow vessel permeability use dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) pre post treatment correlate change clinical outcome . OUTLINE : Patients receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
