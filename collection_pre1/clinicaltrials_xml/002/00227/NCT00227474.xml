	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make gene-modified virus may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving booster vaccination may make strong immune response prevent delay recurrence cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well vaccine therapy work treat patient stage IIIB stage IV breast cancer remission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0348 Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Breast Cancer Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine feasibility conduct live viral vaccine trial use adjuvant recombinant modify vaccinia Ankara-5T4 vaccine ( TroVax® ) patient stage IIIB-IV breast cancer remission . - Determine progression-free survival patient treat vaccine . - Determine 5T4-specific T-cell immune response patient treat vaccine . - Determine toxicity vaccine patient . - Determine level 5T4-specific antibody response patient treat vaccine . - Correlate , preliminarily , immune response 3- 12-month progression-free survival patient treat vaccine . - Correlate tumor 5T4 expression overall survival progression-free survival patient treat vaccine . - Correlate tumor infiltrate lymphocyte CD1a-positive dendritic cell density development 5T4-specific T-cell immunity patient treated vaccine . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive recombinant modify vaccinia Ankara-5T4 vaccine ( TroVax® ) intramuscularly month month 1-3 . Patients receive booster vaccination month 6 , 9 , 12 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 120 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
