	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vatalanib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth stop blood flow tumor . Octreotide may help control symptom , diarrhea , cause tumor . Giving vatalanib together octreotide may effective treatment neuroendocrine tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give vatalanib together octreotide work treat patient progressive neuroendocrine tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vatalanib Octreotide Treating Patients With Progressive Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine 4-month progression-free overall survival patient progressive low-grade neuroendocrine tumor treat vatalanib octreotide . - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine effect regimen tumor marker ( e.g. , chromogranin A , 5-HIAA , gastrin ) patient . - Determine toxicity tolerability regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral vatalanib daily day 1- 28 octreotide* intramuscularly IV day 1 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients stable dose ( i.e. , change dosage within past 3 month ) octreotide study entry remain current dose schedule study participation ; patient experience hypersensitivity and/or toxicity octreotide may receive vatalanib alone . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 23-44 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
