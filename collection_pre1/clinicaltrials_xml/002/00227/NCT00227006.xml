	<detailed_description>Once intervention class staff contact remove , obese adult participate behavioral weight-loss program often give healthy eat habit regain weight . We examine whether taste-based goal setting , minimize perceive deprivation promote taste moderation , would sustain long-term reduction saturate fat body mass index ( BMI ) . Participants randomize Taste-Based Choices ( taste-based goal set + standard 6-month behavioral weight-loss intervention ) , Smart Consumers ( standard 6-month intervention alone ) Community Access ( access commercial/community-based behavioral weight-loss program ) follow 18 month . To test hypothesis , examine set orthogonal contrast ( TBC SC vs. CA ; TBC vs. SC ) reduction saturate fat ( Block FFQ ) clinic-measured BMI .</detailed_description>
