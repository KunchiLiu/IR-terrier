	<brief_title>Equivalency Of Oral Amoxicillin Vs Injectable Penicillin In Children With Severe Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Injectable penicillin recommend treatment WHO-defined severe pneumonia ( low chest indrawing [ LCI ] ) . Oral amoxicillin , find equally effective , could reduce referral , hospitalization , treatment cost . We aim determine whether oral amoxicillin parenteral penicillin equivalent treatment severe pneumonia child age 3-59 month . METHODS This multicentre randomize , open label equivalency study conduct tertiary care centre 8 country . Children age 3-59 month severe pneumonia hospitalize 48 hour , improve , discharge 5-day course oral amoxicillin . Follow-up evaluation occur 5 14 day enrolment . The primary outcome treatment failure ( persistence LCI new danger sign ) 48 hour . Analyses intention treat per protocol . RESULTS 1702 child randomize receive either oral amoxicillin ( 857 ) parenteral penicillin ( 845 ) 48 hour . Treatment failure 19 % group ( risk difference –0.4 ; 95 % CI –4.2 3.3 ) 48 hour , 22 % ( cumulative ) group 5 day , 25 % group 14 day . Relapse day 5 14 occur 45/1375 ( 3.4 % ) 65/1330 ( 4.8 % ) child , respectively . Infancy ( OR 2.72 , 95 % CI 1.95—3.79 ) , fast breathing ( 1.94 , 1.42—2.65 ) hypoxia ( 1.95 , 1.34—2.82 ) baseline predict treatment failure multivariate analysis . CONCLUSIONS Injectable penicillin oral amoxicillin equivalent treatment severe pneumonia develop world area control environment . Additional research need public health set rural urban area find recommend widespread implementation . Potential benefit oral therapy pneumonia include decrease 1 ) risk needle-borne infection ; 2 ) need referral hospitalization ; 3 ) administration cost 4 ) cost family . ( word count 294 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children age three 59 month admit severe pneumonia . Severe pneumonia define low chest indrawing child cough and/or difficult breathing , able drink central cyanosis , regardless respiratory rate . Known HIV infected patient clinical category N A ( CDC ) include . Presence danger sign current illness ( convulsion , abnormally sleepy difficult awake , stridor calm child ) . Severe malnutrition define weight age equal le 3 SD kwashiorkor ) . Hospitalization last two week . This exclude case possible nosocomial pneumonia could require second line antibiotic . Known prior episode asthma . These patient may respiratory distress without infection often need antibiotic . Children 3 episode wheeze past also exclude . Wheezing improves receive bronchodilator therapy , explain footnote . These child may asthma . Measles last month . These patient may immune suppression . Previous history HIV infection clinical category B C ( CDC ) . These patient immune suppression infection may require diagnostic treatment measure ( see annex 1 , page 39 ) . Known clinically recognizable chronic condition ( congenital cardiac respiratory anomaly , chronic lung disease include bronchopulmonary dysplasia , neurological impairment affect respiratory function , renal disease , malignant hematological disease ) . Other disease require antibiotic therapy presenting , meningitis , evident tuberculosis , dysentery , osteomyelitis , septic arthritis , etc . Use antibiotic need treatment . Children Lower Chest Indrawing due noninfective cause cardiac failure , active rickets , severe anemia , sign severe dehydration accord WHO criteria ( see annex 2 , page 42 ) . Children SaO2 &lt; 80 % room air sea level , SaO2 &lt; 75 % Bogota Mexico ( measurement oxygen saturation see Study Manual ) . Known prior anaphylactic reaction penicillin amoxycillin . Known antibiotic therapy 48 hour prior admission . Clinically , child would consider change treatment second line antibiotic admission . Evidence antibiotic use include follow : ) parental report antibiotic give ; b ) parent provide evidence prescription antibiotic c ) container antibiotic ) recognize medication show appropriate container locally available antibiotic . Children receive antibiotic less 48 hour prior admission accept trial . Inability receive oral medication ( three episode vomit per hour ) . These child give oral antibiotic . Previous inclusion trial child already include another trial . Living outside catchment area hospital . These patient may difficult follow discharge . Parental caretaker refusal participate trial .</criteria>
