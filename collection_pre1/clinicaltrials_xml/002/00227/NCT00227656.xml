	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Pegylated interferon alfa-2a may interfere growth tumor cell . Giving capecitabine together pegylated interferon alfa-2a may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give capecitabine together pegylated interferon alfa-2a work treat patient recurrent progressive brain metastasis due breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Brain Metastases Due Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy capecitabine pegylated interferon alfa-2a , term 6-month neurologic progression-free rate , patient recurrent progressive brain metastasis secondary breast cancer . Secondary - Determine toxicity spectrum regimen patient . - Determine time neurologic progression overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 pegylated interferon alfa-2a subcutaneously day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 3 week least 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 38-98 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
