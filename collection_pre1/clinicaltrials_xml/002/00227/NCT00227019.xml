	<brief_summary>This trial evaluate safety combine bevacizumab pemetrexed non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient stable brain metastasis second-line chemotherapy , evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Trial Bevacizumab Combination With Pemetrexed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain metastasis common complication advance non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) initial presentation time disease progression . Patients brain metastasis often exclude large randomized phase III trial due concern poorer survival impaired ability drug cross blood-brain barrier . However , survival improve , trial include patient , often find similar benefit patient metastatic disease elsewhere . Bevacizumab recombinant , humanize monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor , emerge important adjunct platinum-based chemotherapy doublet use advanced NSCLC . This drug normally use first line chemotherapy . Pemetrexed multi-targeted anti-folate agent , approve use first-line ( platinum ) , maintenance , second-line treatment advance nonsquamous NSCLC . Based efficacy pemetrexed second line agent safety question surround bevacizumab treat brain metastasis , trial design look combination agent second line therapy NSCLC patient treat stable brain metastasis</detailed_description>
