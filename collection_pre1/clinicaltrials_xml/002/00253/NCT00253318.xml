	<brief_summary>Primary : - To assess safety tolerability find maximum tolerate dose combination administration RAD001 plus docetaxel give patient metastatic breast cancer consider standard docetaxel treatment ( phase I ) . - To characterize pharmacokinetics RAD001 docetaxel co-administered ( phase I ) . Secondary : - To determine phosphorylation status component mTOR signal pathway expression modifier apoptosis primary breast tumor , order determine whether marker use predictor sensitivity combination RAD001 docetaxel - To determine effect combination RAD001 docetaxel expression phosphorylation mTOR 's target accessible tumor tissue , order identify potential pharmacodynamics marker response drug combination</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAD001 Plus Docetaxel Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Docetaxel drug approve treatment metastatic breast cancer patient either newly diagnose fail earlier chemotherapy . RAD001 investigational drug show anticancer property . It also work weaken immune system . RAD001 work block step require cancer growth . The researcher hop RAD001 may increase anticancer activity docetaxel . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam . Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . You scan ( MRI CT ) check status cancer order primary physician . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . As part study researcher also look tissue original cancer . Special stain do help find way researcher predict response cancer RAD001 . If find eligible take part study , receive docetaxel vein Day 1 one hour . RAD001 give mouth Days 1 8 . RAD 001 give empty stomach light meal . You repeat treatment every 21 day . Three ( 3 ) week equal 1 cycle . Patients participate first part study enrol group 3 time . The dose RAD001 increase new group patient . The dose docetaxel remain . The second part study use high dose RAD001 docetaxel find safe effective first part study . ( ***Study progress second part . *** ) Dexamethasone give mouth twice day 3 day , start day receive docetaxel . Dexamethasone help decrease risk control nausea , vomit , fluid retention . Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test visit . X-rays scan ( CT MRI ) do every 6 week see tumor respond treatment . After 6 cycle combination , docetaxel stop continue take RAD001 alone . However , may able take 6 cycle combination side effect find benefit primary doctor . Once go treatment , physical exam , include routine blood test ( 1-2 teaspoon ) . This investigational study . Docetaxel approve FDA commercially available treatment breast cancer . RAD001 authorize use research . About 65 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . 18 year age old . 2 . Diagnosis metastatic breast cancer least one measurable evaluable lesion . For phase II portion study patient require measurable disease . Response determine use Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . 3 . No limit prior number chemotherapy phase I portion study . No one prior chemotherapy regimen phase II portion study . 4 . Signed informed consent participate study must obtain patient fully inform nature potential risk investigator aid write information . 5 . Adequate bone marrow function show : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1.5 time 10 ( 9 ) /L , Platelets &gt; = 100 time 10 ( 9 ) /L , Hgb &gt; = 10g/dL . 6 . Normal renal function show serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 time Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) . 7 . Hepatic Function Variables : Bilirubin &lt; = ULN Alkaline phosphatase &lt; = 5 time ULN . If alkaline phosphatase &lt; = 2.5 time ULN , ALT/AST must &lt; = 2.0 time ULN . If alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 &lt; = 5 time ULN , ALT/AST must &lt; = 1.5 time ULN 8 . Performance Status 02 World Health Organization ( WHO ) scale . 1 . Patients enrol Phase I portion trial may receive prior docetaxel adjuvant metastatic setting . Patients enrol Phase II portion trial consider eligible receive prior docetaxel treatment metastatic breast cancer . For purpose protocol , patient develop systemic metastasis &lt; 6 month adjuvant docetaxel consider treatment docetaxel metastatic breast cancer ineligible protocol participation . 2 . Patients history thromboembolism within prior 6 month active thrombophlebitis . 3 . For phase I portion study , patient grade &gt; 2 neuropathy , phase II portion trial , patient &gt; = grade 2 neuropathy . 4 . For phase I portion trial , patient treat brain metastasis stable 3 month eligible protocol participation . However , patient brain metastasis exclude phase II portion trial . 5 . Patients uncontrolled infection . 6 . Patients known history HIV seropositivity . 7 . Patients active , bleed diathesis , oral antivitamin K medication ( except patient receive 1 mg warfarin prevent central venous catheter thrombosis ) . 8 . Patients concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease could compromise participation study ( i.e. , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , congestive cardiac failure , ventricular arrhythmia , active ischemic heart disease , myocardial infarction within six month , chronic liver renal disease , active upper GI tract ulceration ) . 9 . Patients impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) . 10 . Patients receive investigational drug within precede 30 day . 11 . Patients receive mitomycin C nitrosourea . 12 . Patients receive antineoplastic therapy le 14 day prior entry onto study recover toxic effect therapy . 13 . Patients receive radiation therapy within 3 week prior entry study recover toxic effect therapy . 14 . Patients surgery within 2 week prior entry study recover side effect therapy . 15 . Patients history noncompliance medical regimen . 16 . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol . 17 . Patients treat drug recognize strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A4 patient take lithium chloride .</criteria>
