	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Two Doses Galantamine Versus Placebo Treatment Patients With Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dementia chronic , progressive brain disease may involve number symptom , include memory loss change personality , behavior , judgment , attention span , language thought . The common type dementia Alzheimer 's disease . Over time , patient Alzheimer 's disease may lose ability perform daily task relate personal care ( example bathing , dress , eat ) may unable handle money travel familiar place . Several small clinical trial show galantamine safe effective treating symptom associate Alzheimer 's disease . Doses study range 15 - 60 mg/day , galantamine administer two three time daily . Additional information need determine optimal dose regimen galantamine treatment Alzheimer 's ' disease . This multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled ( neither patient study doctor know dose galantamine give ) study evaluate safety effectiveness two dos galantamine , give twice daily , treatment patient Alzheimer 's disease . All patient initially receive placebo 1-month period receive one two dos galantamine ( begin 4 mg twice daily gradually increase 12 16 mg twice daily ) placebo 6 month . The primary measure effectiveness include change baseline end treatment ADAS-cog/11 score ( Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale : sum 11 cognitive item ) CIBIC-plus score ( Clinician 's Interview Based Impression Change - Plus Caregiver Input ) . Additional measure effectiveness assessed end treatment include ADAS-cog/13 score ( Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale : sum 13 cognitive item ) Disability Assessment Dementia ( DAD ) score . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , physical examination , laboratory test ) perform throughout study . Caregiver quality life ( Psychological General Well Being Index , [ PGWB ] ) health/social care resource utilization ( physician health care professional visit , use social service , etc . ) also assess throughout study questionnaire answer caregiver . Blood sample take throughout study determine concentration drug blood . Patients may also participate optional portion study genetic material analyze see contain something would affect way galantamine use body . The study hypothesis galantamine administer either dose effective treatment Alzheimer 's disease compare placebo , well tolerate . This study conduct internationally . A companion study exact design conduct United States . Galantamine tablet ( placebo ) , take orally twice daily 6 month begin 4 mg twice daily gradually increase 12 16 mg twice daily .</detailed_description>
