	<brief_summary>The purpose current study evaluate relative efficacy ( 1 ) modify constraint-induced movement therapy ( mCIMT ) combine eye patching , ( 2 ) mCIMT , ( 3 ) traditional rehabilitation motor , attentional , activity daily live function stroke patient unilateral neglect ( UN ) . UN represent failure respond orient stimulus present contralateral brain lesion . Constraint-induced movement therapy make family treatment involve repeatedly practice use affect limb constraining use unaffected arm clinic home . mCIMT intervention base modification conventional CIMT distributing practice session longer period time . mCIMT attempt supplement inadequacy current rehabilitation program fit good rehabilitation schedule . This technique suggest especially relevant treatment patient UN.Half-field eye patch involves occlusion hemifield eye ( case leave UN , right hemifields eye ) . Patching ipsilateral hemifield believe increase activation involve hemisphere , result increased attention contralateral neglected side . Despite promising relevance mCIMT rehabilitation patient hemiplegia , remain unclear whether mCIMT effective alleviate UN . A issue warrant investigation combine effect mCIMT eye patching . Both approach involve use control sensory input may lead increased activation lesioned hemisphere . Integration approach may efficacious mCIMT without direct intervention UN . This project propose study combine effect approach . It hypothesize combine approach effective mCIMT , hypothesize superior traditional rehabilitation involve amount therapy time . To test hypothesis , 60 patient unilateral stroke UN recruit randomly assign one three treatment group ( i.e. , mCIMT eye patching , mCIMT , traditional rehabilitation ) . Testing UN include use line bisection test , cancellation task , examination extinction double simultaneous stimulation . The outcome measure include traditional motor function test , kinematic analysis , circle discrimination test , daily life functional measure . Each eligible participant test immediately assign intervention three month six month treatment . Each type treatment three-week long . Multivariate analysis covariance use analyze obtain data order test relative effect three treatment . Each participant test motivation participate treatment session use Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale . It hypothesize patient high participation improve low participation . The uniqueness propose project pertains ( 1 ) modification CIMT protocol feasible way ; ( 2 ) concurrent use mCIMT eye patch treat UN post stroke ; ( 3 ) use kinematic analysis detect precise change motor behavior post intervention . Kinematic analysis relevant identify trajectory control deficit may accompany clinically “ recover ” UN . Findings investigation improve assessment treatment UN devastate functional recovery stroke .</brief_summary>
