	<brief_title>Functional Outcomes Following Shoulder Surgery : A Prospective Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose prospective database initiate data collection group patient undergo surgery shoulder . Long-term data collection include information functional status patient ' shoulder well quality life information radiographic result . The database essential element development academic shoulder service University Ottawa . Many area shoulder surgery infancy term minimally invasive technique . Several large area require substantial research order refine decision making . The database allow question answer use retrospective model provide background information require mount large scale randomize controlled trial . The nature database information collection also allow meaningful research complete resident program timely cost-effective manner . This keep training requirement Orthopedic surgery help promote interest area research trainees.The follow example question database information could answer research : 1 . Does length time take access Orthopedic care influence outcome surgery rotator cuff disease ? instability ? arthritis ? 2 . How choice implant arthroplasty affect outcome ( stemmed implant versus resurface arthroplasty ) ? 3 . In subscapularis repair , technique influence outcome ( open subscapularis repair versus arthroscopic subscapularis repair ) ?</detailed_description>
