	<detailed_description>Stroke survivor risk cerebrovascular cardiovascular complication . In Denmark 25 % stroke admission cause recurrent stroke TIA . Little known risk factor recurrent stroke . This investigated cohort study ( RIALTO ) initiate may 2004 . The PREVENT study aim study health behavior stroke survivor well effect preventive intervention aim risk factor associate hypertension . Hypertension main risk factor primary stroke one risk factor know associated stroke recurrence . Inclusion criterion : inclusion RIALTO-cohort , severe cognitive deficit dementia , life threaten disease . Exclusion criterion : discharge nursing home Participants ( n=342 ) randomise either intervention group ( n=171 ) control group ( n=171 ) . Randomisation perform computer-generated allocation schedule , randomisation sequence block previewing . The analyser blind allocation patient . Baselinedata : Blood pressure , BMI Rankin scale monitor day prior discharge.Blood pressure measure accord standard set Danish Society hypertension . Patients intervention group receive visit study nurse one , four , seven , ten month discharge . The aim visit : control patient 's hypertension , reduce risk factor like tobacco smoking obesity , motivate patient physical activity healthy diet well compliance pharmacological treatment hypertension , diabetes , hypercholesterolemia anti-thrombotic treatment.Patients control group receive usual treatment . This study aim test hypothesis , Primary outcome : blood pressure lower great intervention group Secondary outcome : blood pressure low intervention group number patient stop smoke great intervention group The number obese patient reduce BMI great intervention group The number patient Rankin Scale &lt; 3 physically active four hour week great intervention group Time recurrent stroke , MI death long intervention group Outcomes measure follow visit one two year inclusion study . Hypertension define blood pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg &gt; 90 mm Hg . The diagnosis recurrent stroke base CT og MR scan clinical diagnosis make neurologist.MI confirm ECG relevant biomarkers . All participant follow register data six year inclusion participant RIALTO cohort .</detailed_description>
