	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate ( confirm CR , R PR ) patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treat BAY 43-9006 . II . To evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity associate regimen . III . To assess overall progression-free survival group patient treat regimen . IV . To explore , preliminary manner , association gene expression signatures response . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
