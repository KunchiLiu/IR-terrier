	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Safety Different Doses Fluzone® Influenza</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , prospective , active-controlled , single-center , open label , dose-ranging clinical trial TIV ( Fluzone® ) administer healthy 18-to-49 year old adult receive 2003-2004 , 2004-2005 2005-2006 influenza vaccine . Subjects randomize one 7 group ( 4 intramuscular 3 intradermal ) compare immunogenicity safety different concentration standard Fluzone® administer intradermally use Mantoux technique standard Fluzone® administer intramuscularly . The primary objective study compare immunogenicity inject Fluzone® across different dose level different route administration . The secondary objective describe number proportion subject group experience injection site systemic symptom proportion subject experience moderate-to-severe symptom post vaccination . Approximately 31 subject per group ( 217 total ) enrol group determine dose route administration vaccine . Subjects observe clinic least 30 minute immunization maintain memory aid record daily oral temperature systemic local reaction 7 day day immunization . Subjects contact phone 8 12 day immunization review 7-day memory aid , include assessment record daily oral temperature , local systemic reaction , occurrence AEs SAEs . Subjects return 28 ( +/- 3 ) day immunization assess occurrence unsolicited AEs SAEs complete acceptability functional skill questionnaire . Serum immunogenicity evaluation obtain prior first vaccination approximately 28 ( +/- 3 ) day post vaccination . The 2005-2006 formulation use seven group .</detailed_description>
