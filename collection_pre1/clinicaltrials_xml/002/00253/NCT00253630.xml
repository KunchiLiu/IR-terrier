	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well vorinostat work treat patient relapsed refractory indolent non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , vorinostat , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vorinostat may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat Treating Patients With Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate anti-tumor activity SAHA ( vorinostat ) assess objective response rate , time progression survival subject advance lymphoma . II . To assess toxicity profile SAHA patient population . III . To perform correlative laboratory investigation confirm modulation chromatin acetylation biologic target attempt gain insight downstream molecular mechanism involve induction apoptosis mediate SAHA . OUTLINE : Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
