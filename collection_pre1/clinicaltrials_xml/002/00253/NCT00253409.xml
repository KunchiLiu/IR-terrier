	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may shrink tumor remove . Giving radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective without surgery radiation therapy treat mesothelioma . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study combination chemotherapy , surgery , radiation therapy see well work compare combination chemotherapy alone treat patient mesothelioma remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Surgery Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Mesothelioma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare feasibility neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy v without surgery adjuvant radiotherapy patient resectable malignant mesothelioma . - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , pilot study follow randomize , control study . Patients undergo 3 course platinum-based ( cisplatin carboplatin ) combination chemotherapy regimen determine treatment center . Upon completion combination chemotherapy , patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm provide tumor resectable disease progression . - Arm I : Patients undergo extra-pleural pneumonectomy follow post-operative radiotherapy . - Arm II : Patients undergo follow-up . Patients may receive additional standard therapy accord treatment center . Quality life assess baseline , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year annually thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50-670 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
