	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth pancreatic cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving gemcitabine hydrochloride together bevacizumab surgery may kill remain tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study gemcitabine hydrochloride bevacizumab see well work compare gemcitabine hydrochloride alone treat patient undergo surgery pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free interval patient adenocarcinoma pancreas treat surgical resection follow adjuvant gemcitabine hydrochloride v without bevacizumab . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Evaluate tumor gene expression profile level tumor angiogenesis marker establish prognostic indicator response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , control study . All patient undergo surgical resection pancreatic tumor . Within 4-8 week surgery , patient stratify accord project 2-year survival ( ≤ 5 % v &gt; 5 % ≤ 33 % v &gt; 33 % ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 100 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course . Patients receive bevacizumab IV alone every 2 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 100 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 130 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
