	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Safety Risperidone Compared With Placebo Treatment Manic Episodes Associated With Bipolar I Disorder , Maintenance Anti-manic Effectiveness Risperidone Compared With Haloperidol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antipsychotic agent , long time , use alleviate severe behavioral problem associate manic episode . Risperidone , widely use treatment schizophrenia , show effective treatment manic mixed episode associate bipolar disorder . This randomized , double-blind study evaluate effectiveness safety risperidone compare placebo 3 week treatment patient bipolar disorder experience manic episode . A secondary objective estimate difference anti-manic efficacy risperidone haloperidol ( active comparator ) 12 week treatment . Haloperidol also serve internal control 3-week treatment period . The study two 2 phase : acute period consist 3 week double-blind treatment ( risperidone , haloperidol , placebo ) follow maintenance period consist 9 week double-blind treatment ( risperidone haloperidol ) 9 week open-label treatment ( risperidone ) . Patients receive study medication take orally day gradually increase dos first week ( risperidone , range 1 - 6 mg/day haloperidol , range 2 - 12 mg/day ) achieve optimal effectiveness , minimize intolerance drug . Daily treatment continue optimal dose Week 3 first phase . After complete 3-week double-blind period , patient continue double-blind treatment additional 9 week optimal dose ( placebo patient cross risperidone ) , enter 9-week open-label period risperidone treatment . Adjustment achieve optimal dosage make patient whose medication change upon enter second phase . The primary measure effectiveness ( acute efficacy ) change Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) total score baseline endpoint 3 week acute treatment period . Additional efficacy measure study assess maintenance efficacy . These measure include Clinical Global Impression-Severity Illness ( CGI-S ) scale ; Global Assessment Scale ( GAS ) , assess patient 's level functioning ; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , scale measure psychotic symptom ; Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , evaluate symptom depression . Safety assessment include incidence adverse event measurement vital sign ( temperature , pulse , blood pressure ) throughout study ; evaluation presence severity extrapyramidal symptom Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale ( ESRS ) specify interval ; clinical laboratory test ( hematology , biochemistry , urinalysis ) start end phase study . The study hypothesis 3 week daily treatment risperidone effective placebo , measure Young Mania Rating Scale score , treatment manic phase Bipolar I Disorder . Acute phase : Risperidone orally , once-daily : 2 mg Day 1 , 1 - 3 mg Days 2 4 , 1 - 6 mg Days 5 21 ; haloperidol orally , once-daily : 4 mg Days 1 4 2 - 12 mg Days 5 21 ; placebo orally , once-daily Days 1 21 . Maintenance phase : optimal dose risperidone haloperidol 9 week ( placebo patient cross risperidone ) Open-label phase : risperidone 9 week .</detailed_description>
