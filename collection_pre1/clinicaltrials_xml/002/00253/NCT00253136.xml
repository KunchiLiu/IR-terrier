During first 3 week double-blind treatment , patient receive supplemental daily oral dos placebo risperidone tablet . The primary measure effectiveness change baseline total score Positive Negative Syndrome Scale Schizophrenia ( PANSS ) . The PANSS rating scale measure symptoms schizophrenia . Safety evaluation include incidence adverse event , result clinical laboratory test ( hematology , biochemistry , urinalysis ) , measurement vital sign body weight , physical examination electrocardiogram ( ECG ) finding , clinical examination injection area ( buttock ) , Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale ( ESRS ) , scale use measure effect antipsychotic medication motor function patient . Additional testing conduct include Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) , rating system use evaluate overall severity clinical change patient various disease affect brain , SF-36 Health Survey , questionnaire patient fill extensively used rate patient 's quality life . The study hypothesis injectable form risperidone effective placebo , measure change baseline total PANSS score , patient schizophrenia . 1-week run-in period : risperidone oral tablet , 4 mg/day . During first 3 week double-blind period : risperidone oral tablet , 2 , 4 , 6 mg/day placebo tablet .
