	<brief_summary>Our specific aim gain understanding protein synthesis rate burn patient various time injury recovery use PET scan . This compare healthy volunteer control . We hope help optimize nutrition care regimens future burn patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alterations Protein Synthesis Rates Burn Patients Measured Over Time Using PET Scans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study understand muscle build broken ( metabolism ) burn patient healthy people.The study help u understand muscle metabolism different burn patient healthy subject . We hope find way help body burn victim heal without lose much muscle . Protein important part daily diet . Normally , body break protein eat small piece call amino acid . It use amino acid make protein . It use protein heal wound , fight infection , provide energy . After burn injury , body speed pace life activity . It need energy stay alive recover burn . The body often get extra energy need break protein muscle amino acid . The amino acid make new protein . If much muscle break , hard body function . This make recovery slow possibly lead death . For Healthy Volunteers , study require 6 hour time total . This time spread two visit , Screening Visit Scan Visit . For Burn Patients , study require 14 hour total . This time spread four visits-a screen visit maximum 3 scan visit . A total three PET scan do 2 year period .</detailed_description>
