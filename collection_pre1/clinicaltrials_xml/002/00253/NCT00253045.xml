	<brief_title>Motivating HIV+ Women : Risk Reduction ART Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women fast grow group person AIDS . They often diagnose later disease , antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) strongly indicate . Currently ART involve use multiple medication must take strict condition regular time interval many 4 different time day . Some medication must take empty stomach , high fat food , low fat food , must coordinate throughout day . It extremely important patient take ART exactly prescribe miss dos order reduce amount HIV virus bloodstream , increase CD4 cell count , prevent serious consequence AIDS , hospitalization , development drug resistant strain . These regimen-related problem high care-taking burden place HIV+ woman child partner make near perfect adherence difficult achieve . And , woman ART begin feel good resume normal activity , include sexual activity , adherence behavior contribute reduce risk spread HIV ( RRB ) , condom use safe needle use injection drug user become crucial . Researches show 11 % 63 % HIV+ woman use condom consistently . The primary purpose randomize control behavioral trial test effect nurse lead group motivational intervention HIV+ woman adherence ART RRB . The secondary purpose examine mediator effect 3 variable show important behavior change : self-efficacy , outcome expectancy , personal goal . The Motivational Group + Usual Care ( MG+UC ) intervention build usual care provide agency Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) central component . It consist 8 90 minute session , 1 week apart , lead specially trained nurse , motivate woman adhere ART RRB . The intervention compare 8 session health promotion program ( HPP+UC ) lead nurse health educator . These session focus nutrition , exercise , stress management , woman 's health issue . These session also 90 minute length meet weekly 8 week . Both group receive beauty pamper incentive beauty makeover , skin care instruction , massage several session , well child care , transportation token , monetary incentive $ 10 attendance first 4 group $ 15 attendance last 4 group . Snacks appropriate ART immune status supply MG+UC group , fruit , vegetable , nutritious snack provide HPP+UC group . Groups hold AID Atlanta , Infectious Disease Program Grady Health System , Infectious Disease Clinic Emory Crawford Long . In order eligible participate , woman must HIV+ , 18 year age , new different ART self-reported nonadherence current ART regimen , speak understand English , mentally stable determine screening assessment . All participant complete baseline assessment , follow-up assessment immediately , 3 , 6 , 9 month end group . Participants pay $ 25 assessment . We expect 300 woman randomized participate ; pregnant woman exclude . We hypothesize woman randomize MG+UC group , , immediate , 3 , 6 , 9 month follow-up assessment higher mean adherence rate ART , report frequent use RRB , high CD4 count , low mean viral load randomize HPP+UC group . We also hypothesize effect intervention adherence ART RRB bring high mean level self-efficacy , positive expect outcomes , specific effective personal goal . As noted , MI form basis intervention . MI client-focused method counseling use help client deal ambivalence change behavior . MI principle include express empathy , develop discrepancy , roll resistance , support self-efficacy . It use primarily individual , MI group describe substance user . Our application group format HIV+ woman new innovative . All participant receive usual care plus either Health Promotion Program Motivational Interviewing Intervention . How usual care administer varies agency general ART consist prescription new different ART regimen base establish clinical criterion guideline Panel Clinical Practices Treatment HIV infection , education medication ( include action , side effect , special requirement ) , set medication schedule , follow-up regard medication taking . The usual RRB education include information risk reduction practice condom use , sexual practice , needle cleansing , needle sharing . Depending agency , usual care may formalize administer health care provider , nurse , social worker , and/or health educator . This innovative project design promote adherence ART RRB , something describe far literature . Adherence ART promote health reduces infectiousness , include transmission HIV mother fetus .
