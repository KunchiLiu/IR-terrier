	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming , grow , come back . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use arzoxifene tamoxifen may prevent breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . The use arzoxifene tamoxifen may keep breast cancer form woman high risk breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study arzoxifene see well work compare tamoxifen placebo prevent breast cancer premenopausal woman high risk breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare effect arzoxifene v tamoxifen v placebo surrogate endpoint biomarkers , especially systemic insulin-like growth factor level , woman high risk breast cancer . - Compare toxic effect , biologic effect , clinical pharmacology , pharmacodynamics drug participant . - Determine effect drug surrogate endpoint biomarkers participant BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation . - Determine feasibility chemoprevention study participant strong family history breast cancer . OUTLINE : This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind study . Participants randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Participants receive oral tamoxifen daily . - Arm II : Participants receive oral arzoxifene daily . - Arm III : Participants receive oral placebo daily . In arm , treatment continue 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 6 month treatment , participant offer opportunity continue treatment assign study drug additional 6 month . Participants randomize receive placebo offer treatment arzoxifene additional 6 month . After completion study treatment , participant follow annually . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 120 participant accrue study .</detailed_description>
