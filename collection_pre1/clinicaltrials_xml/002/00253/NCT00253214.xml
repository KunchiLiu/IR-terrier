	<brief_title>Placebo-Controlled Evaluation Galantamine Treatment Alzheimer 's Disease : Safety Efficacy Controlled-Release Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dementia chronic , progressive brain disease may involve number symptom , include memory loss change personality , behavior , judgment , attention span , language thought . The common type dementia Alzheimer 's disease . Over time , patient Alzheimer 's disease may lose ability perform daily task relate personal care ( example , bathing , dress , eat ) may unable handle money travel familiar place .

This multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety effectiveness controlled-release form galantamine patient Alzheimer 's disease . All patient receive placebo first month study . Patients receive controlled-release galantamine ( 8 - 24 mg daily ) , immediate-release galantamine ( 4 - 12 mg twice daily ) placebo 6 month . The dose galantamine start 8 mg/day may increase 24 mg/day , need . The dose may adjust first 12 week double-blind treatment base upon effectiveness tolerability . Patients continue receive dose take end 12 week remainder study . The primary measure effectiveness include change baseline end treatment ADAS-cog/11 ( Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale : sum 11 cognitive item ) CIBIC-plus ( Clinician 's Interview Based Impression Change - Plus Caregiver Input ) score . Additional measure effectiveness include change baseline Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities Daily Living ( ADCS-ADL ) Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) score . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , physical examination , laboratory test ) perform throughout study . Patients complete double-blind portion study opportunity receive galantamine open-label follow-up study . Patients may also participate optional portion study genetic material analyze see contain something would affect way galantamine use body . The study hypothesis treatment controlled-release galantamine effective improving symptom Alzheimer 's disease well tolerate . Controlled-release galantamine 8 - 24 mg mouth daily , immediate-release galantamine 4 - 12 mg mouth twice daily , placebo . Dosing start 8 mg/day may increase 24 mg/day , need .
