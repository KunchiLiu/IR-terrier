	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Ambient air pollutant tobacco smoke produce adverse respiratory health effect child . Differences susceptibility outcomes likely involve genetic variation multiple pathophysiological pathway modulate response subsequent biologic effect follow exposure . The study initially investigate hypothesis genetic variant oxidant stress pathway modulate occurrence adverse outcome use candidate gene approach Children 's Health Study ( CHS ) , longitudinal study child 's respiratory health 12 Southern California community . The investigator find variant GSTM1 ( null ) , GSTP1 ( A105G ) , TNF ( - 308 ) , ICAM-1 ( 241 ) associate reduced lung function growth , increase asthma occurrence , increase respiratory illness . These variant also show gene-environment gene-gene interaction tobacco smoke ambient air pollutant . Their finding add grow body evidence pathway involve glutathione ( GSH ) play important role respiratory health . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In initial grant period , investigator study effect ambient air pollution tobacco smoke child 's respiratory health role diet , physical activity genetic variation susceptibility ambient air pollutant complete specific aim . They note association genotype study reduced lung function growth , increase sensitivity utero exposure maternal smoking , increase risk asthma , risk respiratory-related school absence , vary GSTM1 GSTP1 genotype . They note diet low antioxidant vitamin associate deficit lung function low magnesium intake associate lung function deficit . Finally , investigator identify haplotype structure tag single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) select candidate locus employ limited version haplotype analysis investigation association three ICAM-1 variant childhood asthma . The investigator extend candidate gene association study use exist data Children 's Health Study ( CHS ) , examine role sequence variation 38 gene five glutathione ( GSH ) pathways include GSH production , transport , redox cycling , electrophil oxidation product detoxification , nitric oxide cell signal . The exposure interest ozone ( O3 ) , nitric oxide ( NO2 ) , ambient PM2.5 , tobacco smoke . The respiratory health outcome lung function growth , asthma , respiratory absence . Associations respiratory health outcome sequence variant candidate gene air pollution assess use haplotype functional SNPs . They test overall association locus outcome use functional SNPs haplotype-based approach , gene-gene gene-environment interaction within pathway also examine use approach minimize multiple comparison issue . Confounding admixture address use SNP-based genome-wide control method . Finally , hierarchical Bayesian model complex pathway incorporate priori knowledge biological relationship efficiently examine interaction within pathway .</detailed_description>
