	<brief_title>Statin Therapy Heart Failure : Potential Mechanisms Benefit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent evidence suggest HMG-Coenzyme A ( statin ) therapy may associate improved survival ischemic non-ischemic heart failure ( HF ) . Large , randomize outcome study statins HF currently underway , trial address underlying mechanism . The aim study investigate statin ' potentially beneficial mechanism action HF , focusing : 1 ) sympathetic nervous system activation 2 ) myocardial remodeling , 3 ) immune activation heart failure . Fifty patient systolic HF non-ischemic etiology single center randomize double-blinded fashion 3 month atorvastatin 10mg QD ( 25 subject ) vs match placebo QD ( 25 subject ) . The following exam perform baseline ( pre-treatment ) end study ( post-treatment ) : sympathetic microneurography , echocardiography , peripheral blood chemokine analysis . Sympathetic microneurography peroneal nerve directly quantify change sympathetic nerve activity ( bursts/minute ) . Echocardiography ( addition MRI subset subject without pacemaker implantable defibrillator ) use track change cardiac structure function ; index remodel include measurement leave ventricular mass index , leave ventricular volume index , leave ventricular ejection fraction , subendocardial scar quantification ( MRI ) . Immune activation characterize circulate cytokine chemokines . Additionally , quantification establish cardiac biomarkers ( cardiac troponin , B-type natriuretic peptide , C-reactive Protein ) , Holter monitor/heart rate variability study , quality life global clinical assessment perform pre- post- treatment . Neither sympathetic microneurography MRI previously utilize assess statin ' effect human HF . The impact statin therapy inflammatory chemokine activation HF also study . The knowledge gain proposed investigation may serve basis understand statin therapy potential improve clinical outcome HF , may ultimately lead new therapeutic strategy HF .</detailed_description>
