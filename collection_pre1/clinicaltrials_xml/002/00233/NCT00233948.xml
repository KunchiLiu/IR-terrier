	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Antiviral drug , nelfinavir mesylate , may help prevent cancer cell spread . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose nelfinavir mesylate see well work treat patient recurrent , metastatic , unresectable liposarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nelfinavir Mesylate Treating Patients With Recurrent , Metastatic , Unresectable Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity tolerance nelfinavir patient liposarcoma . II . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) nelfinavir give daily single agent describe toxicity study . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics nelfinavir . IV . To assess response rate progression free survival patient liposarcoma treat nelfinavir . V. To evaluate expression activity certain protein tumor patient enter study , may important cytotoxicity nelfinavir ( SREBP-1 , p21 , NFkB ( NFkappaB ) , caspase 3 ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive oral nelfinavir mesylate twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
