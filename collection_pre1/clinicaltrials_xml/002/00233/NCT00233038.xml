	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn new treatment pancreatic cystic lesion . The injection alcohol cyst common way treat cyst liver , kidney , thyroid . We would like find injection alcohol would useful treatment pancreatic cystic lesion . The treatment alcohol use endoscopy endoscopic ultrasound ( procedure use scope place mouth stomach ) . We hypothesize half cyst inject ethanol resolve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EUS-Guided Pancreatic Injection Cyst ( EPIC ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic lesion kidney , thyroid , liver commonly treat ethanol injection cyst cavity . The contact ethanol result rapid elimination epithelial cell line cyst cavity complication pain . The majority cysts become small completely eliminate Depending type cyst tissue , cysts completely ablate ethanol . Although malignant mass arise pancreas safely injected ethanol , report injection pancreatic cystadenomas . The ability ablate cystadenomas pancreas would provide first non-surgical treatment pre-malignant lesion pancreas . Over past two year conduct pilot study EUS-guided ethanol lavage pancreatic cyst ( 2001-P-000358/5 ) . 18 patient undergone procedure without evidence pancreatitis , pain , infection follow procedure . Initially , low concentration ethanol use ( 5 % ) course study , concentration ethanol use lavage increase 60 % . Although patient undergone careful follow-up evaluation , appear least 4 patient resolution cyst . This prospective , randomize , blind , control trial ethanol ablation 50 patient pancreatic cystadenoma . Patients pancreatic cyst ( 1-5cm diameter ) capable safely undergo endoscopy conscious sedation candidate . Exclusion criterion include : coagulopathy ( INR &gt; 1.5 , PTT &gt; 100 , platelet &lt; 50k ) , active infection cyst unstable cardio-pulmonary disease ( active angina , home O2 , pulmonary edema ) exclude . At time diagnostic cyst aspiration , patient randomize either saline lavage ethanol ( 70 % ) lavage . During exam , cyst image ultrasound , measure aspirate . The cyst content evaluate cytologic evaluation , CEA , amylase . After cyst aspiration , cyst lavaged either saline ethanol 5 minute . At completion lavage , cyst content evacuate . The patient provide result cyst fluid analysis may elect undergo surgical resection additional lavage treatment . At time resection , cyst surround pancreas resect histologic analysis . The degree epithelial ablation determine histologic section cyst lavaged ethanol compare cyst lavaged saline . If patient chooses surgical resection , patient may return follow-up EUS exam two additional monthly interval cyst aspiration additional ethanol lavage . Those patient receive saline initial treatment session crossed-over ethanol .</detailed_description>
