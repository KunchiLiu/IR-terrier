	<brief_summary>Background : - The Baltimore Longitudinal Study Aging ( BLSA ) clinical research program human age begin 1958 . Volunteers different age join study healthy , follow-up visit life . Visits last multiple day . Participants evaluate many physical element well brain function . Physical test give . Information mood , personality , social aspect life also collect . This program contribute research project understand age . Objectives : - To characterize many aspect age process learn people successfully adapt age . Eligibility : - Healthy individual least 20 year old .

	<detailed_description>The Baltimore Longitudinal Study Aging ( BLSA ) NIA major clinical research program human age conduct Baltimore since 1958 . The study population series healthy volunteer different age follow indefinitely serial evaluation time . The major aim study characterize age process multifaceted aspect . To accomplish task , large cohort volunteer disperse wide age range enrol study healthy , follow regular follow-up visit life . Since age process involve whole range physiological domain , participant receive extensive evaluation physiological parameter , biomarkers , risk factor , disease-related measure , impairment , physical cognitive function follow-up visit last multiple day . Blood sample specimen collect obtain part measure and/or store future use . Information mood , personality , psychological social aspect life relevant study age also collect . Information collect BLSA represent unique source longitudinal data age . Historically BLSA contribute research project understand age . More recently , BLSA begin focus factor associate exceptionally healthy aging .</detailed_description>
