	<brief_title>Phase II Midostaurin Aggressive Systemic Mastocytosis Mast Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study assess activity safety profile twice-daily oral dos midostaurin patient aggressive systemic mastocytosis ( ASM ) mast cell leukemia ( MCL ) without associate clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease ( AHNMD ) . Aggressive systemic mastocytosis ( ASM ) mast cell leukemia ( MCL ) characterize excessive bone marrow production mast cell infiltrate tissue release harmful substance , result organ damage . These disease limit treatment option poor prognosis . Existing treatment advance mast cell disease , eg , interferon-alpha ; corticosteroid ; and/or cladribine , exhibit low response rate usually partial nature .</detailed_description>
