	<brief_title>Patient Centered Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous trial prove efficacy radiation follow breast conserve surgery systemic therapy increase disease-free overall survival among woman early-stage breast cancer . Yet 14 % -89 % woman receive , especially minority woman . Despite low incidence disease , African American woman likely white woman die breast cancer . As near racial equity rate breast cancer screening , disparity treatment mortality remain . Efforts achieve control breast cancer reduce racial disparity mortality fully realize proven effective treatment provide benefit . Underuse effective treatment may cause patient , physician system factor . For breast cancer screening , woman 's lack access care ; insurance ; transportation ; belief fatalism curability , cancer 's effect partner relationship , impact mammography rate . For breast cancer treatment , little known patient-related reason underuse , less know racial difference reason . Interventions target specific cause likely succeed . For breast cancer screening , patient-centered intervention successfully raise mammography rate among minority woman include lay health worker raise awareness address cultural belief barrier screen , voucher pay screen navigator help woman abnormal screening obtain needed follow-up . For breast cancer treatment , patient-assistance program provide practical support financial counseling , aid navigating complex healthcare system , emotional support , information cancer treatment . Such program abound patient often unaware . While service may increase receipt effective adjuvant therapy , strategy rigorously test . We propose conduct randomize controlled trial evaluate effectiveness patient-assistance program compare usual care receipt adjuvant therapy among minority nonminority woman newly operate early-stage breast cancer . During 24 month trial , assess patient ' belief cancer treatment , practical , psychosocial , informational need barrier care . We identify train employee exist cancer assistance service order increase sustainability program beyond grant-funded cycle . Specifically , propose : 1 . To assess racial difference early-stage breast cancer patient ' experience , beliefs barrier effective adjuvant treatment ; 2 . To evaluate effectiveness intervention connect woman early-stage breast cancer cancer-related need community hospital-based patient-assistance program reduce underuse effective adjuvant breast cancer treatment overall minority population assess sustainability ; 3 . To evaluate whether patient assistance intervention affect patient ' knowledge , attitude behavior</detailed_description>
