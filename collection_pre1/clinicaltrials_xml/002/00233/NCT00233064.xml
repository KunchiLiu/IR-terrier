	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure rate anti-palivizumab antibody ( also refer immune reactivity immunogenicity ) subject receive either liquid lyophilized formulation palivizumab . This study compare number percentage subject anti-palivizumab antibody receive either liquid lyophilized formulation palivizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Immune Reactivity Liquid Lyophilized Formulations Palivizumab ( MEDI-493 , Synagis )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The approved liquid formulation palivizumab develop simplify preparation drug injection . Both formulation palivizumab show bioequivalent child 6 month age young history chronic lung disease . In previous study liquid palivizumab , immunogenicity evaluate 2 month dose adult , 1 month dose child . In study , MI-CP116 , immunogenicity evaluate 4 6 month last dose study drug , order provide data time point significantly distant dose drug interference minimal .</detailed_description>
