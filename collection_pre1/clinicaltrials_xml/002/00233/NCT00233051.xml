	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether analysis gene sputum useful noninvasive technique measure response drug patient COPD . We propose use polymerase chain reaction evaluate gene expression induce sputum adult current smoker moderate COPD , adult former smoker moderate COPD . This study design determine whether change expression previously-identified inflammatory marker induce sputum detect response drug therapy COPD evaluate potential difference expression marker adult smoker without COPD . Pre- post-treatment serum obtain facilitate proteomic analysis therapeutic response well . Changes sputum gene expression response treatment primary outcome variable study . Secondary outcome include change lung function , well change induce sputum inflammation . These endpoint evaluate directly 6 week randomly-assigned treatment either salmeterol xinafoate fluticasone propionate/50mcg salmeterol xinafoate combination DPI bid . Endpoints re-evaluated follow 4 week wash-out period .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Twenty adult subject ≥ 40 year age ≥ 10 pack/year cigarette history evaluate . Subjects recruit onehalf current smoker onehalf former smoker . All subject COPD ( FEV1/FVC &lt; 70 % FEV1 = &gt; 40 % predict ) . Airway hyperresponsiveness diffusion capacity carbon monoxide also perform precisely characterize physiologic phenotype subject . Subjects exclude use inhaled systemic corticosteroid antibiotic use within 6 week currently treat theophylline . A 6 week run upper respiratory infection require qualifying subject .</criteria>
