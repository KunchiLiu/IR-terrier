	<criteria>A clinical diagnosis DM1 accord accepted clinical research criteria.23 The clinical research criterion require following : ( 1 ) clinically evident myotonia ; ( 2 ) muscle weakness characteristic distribution ( distal predominant ) ; ( 3 ) similar finding first degree relative . Age 21 60 year ( inclusive ) . Ability walk 30 foot without assistance ( cane leg bracing permit ) . Weakness sufficient severity justify treatment provide reasonable opportunity observe therapeutic effect . At eligibility evaluation , eligible patient must show following : 1. muscle strength distal muscle group ( ankle dorsiflexors deep flexor finger ) less equal grade 4 ( Medical Research Council grade ) . 2. muscle strength proximal midlimb muscle group ( flexor extensor knee , elbow , shoulder , hip ) great equal 4 ( Medical Research Council grade ) . For patient within drive distance Rochester , local health care provider area must able complete home visit . Competent , willing , able give inform consent . Able selfadminister study medication subcutaneous injection caregiver available administer study medication . Congenital DM1 . Congenital disease constitute ~10 % case DM1 . Early life , weakness individual congenital DM1 derive maldevelopment skeletal muscle rather muscle degeneration . Later life , individual also subject added effect waste process similar classical DM1 . However , difficult determine phenomenon mainly blame weakness particular patient . Furthermore , 75 % patient congenital DM1 mental retardation . Prior treatment glucocorticoid , anabolic steroid , testosterone , growth hormone , IGFI within 1 year entry ; investigational agent within 60 day entry . Any history malignancy except surgically cure skin cancer pilomatricoma ( benign tumor hair follicle associate DM1 ) . Women childbearing potential use effective birth control ; woman pregnant lactate . Medical illness would prevent assessment muscle strength function . This exclusion would include individual orthopedic , cardiac , pulmonary disorder preclude proper position myometry test table , restrict ability tolerate repeat maximum muscle contraction . Known allergy tetracycline . Diaphragmatic weakness patient unable tolerate supine position , swallow impairment patient unable maintain nutrition without use gastrostomy . Symptomatic liver kidney disease , insulin require diabetes type 2 diabetes require oral antidiabetic agent . Untreated thyroid disease ( hypo hyperthyroidism ) Major psychiatric illness ( major depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia ) within twelve month entry . History noncompliance therapy . Drug alcohol abuse within 12 month enrollment . In men , evidence mass lesion clinical examination primary care physician within twelve month prior entry study ( specifically prostate testicular mass clinical exam sign mass lesion ) evidence mass lesion chest xray . In men 50 year age old , prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) elevation normal . In woman , evidence mass lesion clinical examination primary care physician gynecologist ( specifically breast &amp; pelvic exam ) within 12 month entry study evidence mass lesion chest xray . In woman 40 year age old , evidence mass lesion mammogram . Women Gail Scores &gt; 1.7 excluded due increase risk develop cancer . Atrial fibrillation/flutter ; 2nd 3rd degree heart block without pacemaker treatment Weight great 100 kilogram ( kg ) . Body Mass Index great 30 . History bleed diathesis use anticoagulant medication . Patients take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent ask discontinue medication 3 day prior muscle biopsy .</criteria>
