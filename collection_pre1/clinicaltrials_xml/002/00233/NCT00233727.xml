	<detailed_description>Participants Clinical Examinations : Unscreened , non-pregnant woman 35-65 year age enrol three closely locate clinical site Khayelitsha , South Africa . All woman provide informed consent , receive counsel confidential HIV serotesting , questionnaire , pregnancy test postmenopausal , anonymous HIV serotesting , vaginal speculum examination nurse train visual inspection cervix acetic acid ( VIA ) . Cervical specimen obtain test N. gonorrhea , Chlamydia trachomatis high-risk type HPV , cytology . The cervix wash 5 % acetic acid inspect gross abnormality area acetowhitening 35 mm . photograph take . Women significant cervicitis vulvovaginitis treat use syndromic approach . N. gonorrhea Chlamydia trachomatis positive woman receive appropriate therapy . A positive VIA examination define acetowhite lesion attempt make differentiate acetowhitening metaplasia CIN . Women lesions suspicious cancer , large acetowhite lesion extend 70 % cervix endocervical canal , 374 unsuitable cryotherapy due severe atrophy , polyp , cervix distort , cervix adequately visualize exclude . These woman refer colposcopy . Women ask return 2-6 day later randomization either : ( 1 ) HPV arm HPV DNA positive woman receive cryotherapy ; ( 2 ) VIA arm VIA positive woman receive cryotherapy ; ( 3 ) delay evaluation arm woman follow untreated , irrespective HPV VIA status . Randomization do patient level use computer-generated randomization schedule arm assignment provide clinic seal envelope . Cryotherapy perform nurse use N2O cryosurgical unit ( Wallach Surgical Devices , Orange , CT ) use two 3-minute freeze . Cytology result available time cryotherapy . Both treat untreated woman ask return 4 week questionnaire . At 6 month , colposcopy do physician blind arm clinical information . All acetowhite lesion biopsied endocervical curettage . Women CIN 2+ treat LEEP . Examinations woman become pregnant study postpone three month post-partum . Blood anonymous HIV serotesting obtain . All woman HPV VIA-positive enrollment subset HPV VIA-negative ( woman enrol 2002 ) schedule repeat colposcopy 12 month , 24 month 36 month post-randomization . At visit , cervical sample collect colposcopy biopsy indicate perform . Laboratory Testing : HPV test do use Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA assay high-risk probe mixture ( Digene Corporation , Gaithersburg , MD ) University Cape Town . Biopsies process Columbia University blindly evaluate single pathologist .</detailed_description>
