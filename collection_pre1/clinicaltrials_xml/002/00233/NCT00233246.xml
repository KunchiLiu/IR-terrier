	<brief_summary>This study compare patient mild moderate prolongation INR test receive FFP infusion prior invasive hepatobiliary procedure bleed complication patient receive FFP infusion . Bleeding complication define meet one following : 1 . Intrahepatic hematoma great 1 ml/kg patient weight see post-procedure ultrasound examination perform 4 30 hour procedure . 2 . Greater 1.6g/dL hemoglobin decline measure within 4 30 hour post-procedure compare pre-procedure value , absence another identify bleeding source account hemoglobin drop . 3 . Need transfusion pack red blood cell procedure-related bleeding study . The secondary endpoint study : 1 ) The need perform subsequent procedure ( angiography , embolization , additional imaging study include computerize tomography ( CT ) scan , surgery ) diagnose arrest procedure-related bleeding OR need subsequent medical therapy ( FFP , coagulation factor concentrate , anti-fibrinolytics ) treat procedure-related bleeding time procedure end patient 's time study . If necessary , relationship procedure therapy procedure-related bleeding assess adjudication panel ; 2 ) The predictive value INR ; 3 ) The effect study treatment change INR ; 4 ) The cost prevent one bleed ; 5 ) The predictor bleed INR ; 6 ) The number transfusion-associated adverse event encounter prevent one bleed ; 7 ) The effect treatment bleed grade .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : It important determine whether prophylactic FFP necessary patient mild moderate elevation INR require invasive procedure . It also important establish whether routine pre-procedure coagulation test predictive bleed outcome time significant invasive procedure . Although prophylactic FFP often give patient invasive procedure , little evidence show pre-procedure INR range predictive procedure-related bleeding prophylactic FFP reduces risk . DESIGN NARRATIVE : After obtain consent verify eligibility requirement , study staff randomize patient one two treatment group . One group receive prophylactic FFP infusion hepatobiliary procedure . The group receive prophylactic FFP . The dose FFP approximately 10 ml/kg . The dose FFP patient determine one two way accordance local policy : 1 ) round near integer number unit ( Method 1 ) ; 2 ) use split unit ( Method 2 ) . The method chosen may vary patient ( e.g. , physician might decide dose adult patient round near integer number unit dose pediatric patient use split unit ) . Method 1 : The dose FFP number unit come closest dose 10 ml/kg , determine follow : near integer ( 10 x weight kg ) /200 . Decimals .5 higher rounded next integer . Decimals less .5 round ( e.g. , 70 kg patient would receive 4 unit , 69 kg patient would receive 3 unit ) . Method 2 : The dose FFP chosen order come close possible dose 10 ml/kg , contain either full unit , split unit , combination thereof . After FFP infusion ( ) within 2 hour prior hepatobiliary procedure , blood drawn laboratory test repository . Although Study Hemostasis Invasive Procedures ( SHIP ) truly blind study , clinician perform hepatobiliary procedure radiology team perform post-procedure ultrasound tell whether participant receive prophylactic FFP . They also know result immediate pre-procedure Prethrombin Time ( PT ) /INR Partial Thomboplastin Time ( PTT ) test . Participants study may treat systemic hemostatic agent prior procedure . Local hemostatic treatment may use procedure , accord standard practice . The invasive hepatobiliary procedure technique , concomitant treatment intervention , post-procedure treatment intervention discretion treat physician . Participants follow clinical evidence bleeding treat need bleeding may occur . Repository sample use genetic protein test hemostasis , coagulation , fibrinolysis . SHIP design one-sided non-inferiority study . The null hypothesis proportion patient give prophylactic FFP meet criterion bleed endpoint least .04 high proportion patient give prophylactic FFP meet criterion bleed endpoint . The goal study determine whether strong evidence difference two treatment plan large .</detailed_description>
