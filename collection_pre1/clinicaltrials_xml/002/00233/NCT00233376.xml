	<brief_title>Computerized Decision Support System Antibiotic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antibiotic treatment suspect moderate severe bacterial infection usually initiate empirically , prior identification causative pathogen . Appropriate treatment , match in-vitro susceptibility subsequently isolate pathogen , reduces overall fatality rate severe infection adjust odds ratio vary 1.6 6.9 . In study , 20-50 % patient give inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment . We develop computerized decision support system ( TREAT ) base causal probabilistic network improve antibiotic treatment inpatient . The aim system improve rate appropriate antibiotic treatment , thereby reduce mortality , route antibiotic use towards ecologically economical antibiotic determine local resistance profile . The system calibrate different location . The TREAT system test multi-center observational cohort study . The study prove system safe effective . TREAT prescribed appropriate antibiotic treatment 70 % patient , 58 % treat appropriately physician . TREAT use narrow antibiotic formulary low cost , mainly lower cost assign model future resistance . The system perform well three different country ( Israel , Italy Germany ) . We proceed assess effect TREAT management inpatient sit cluster randomize control trial . We use ward unit randomization avoid contamination education user system , benefit interaction TREAT ward whole . Comparison : TREAT system instal intervention ward use offer physician time empirical antibiotic treatment . Physicians ask inspect TREAT â€™ result interface . The final choice antibiotic treatment . Control ward access system . We assess outcome intervention vs. control ward regard patient outcome , appropriateness antibiotic treatment antibiotic cost .</detailed_description>
