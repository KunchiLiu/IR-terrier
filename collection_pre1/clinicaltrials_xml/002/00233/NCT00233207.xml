	<brief_title>IC14 Antibodies Treat Individuals With Acute Lung Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This study use IC14 , recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) recognize CD14 , block CD14 medicate cellular activation patient sepsis-induced ALI . Research result antibody interaction CD14 suggest CD14 central role recognition bacterial product induction innate immune response . Although beneficial , response combine component alveolar stretch may induce exaggerated response harmful . This study implement strategy block CD14-mediated cellular activation evaluate whether strategy beneficial effect reduce alveolar inflammatory response , mechanical ventilation day , multiple organ failure , severity organ dysfunction patient sepsis-induced ALI . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The primary outcome study alveolar lavage concentration interleukin-8 measure post-treatment Days 2 3 , Days 6 8 . The key secondary outcome study : 1 ) Worst Murray Lung Injury Score ( measure Days 1 7 , Day 28 ) ; 2 ) Worst Multiple Organ Dysfunction ( MOD ) Score ( Marshall ) ( measure Days 1 7 , Day 28 ) ; 3 ) Infections-nosocomial and/or surgical site infection ( measure Day 28 ) ; 4 ) Ventilator-free day ( measure Day 28 ) ; 5 ) Mortality ( measure Day 28 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Presence ALI , define follow : 1 . Acute onset ( le 28 day study entry ) 2 . PaO2/FiO2 less 300 3 . Bilateral infiltrates consistent pulmonary edema frontal chest radiograph ( infiltrates may patchy , diffuse , homogeneous , asymmetric ) 4 . Requirement positive pressure ventilation via endotracheal tube 5 . No clinical evidence leave atrial hypertension Clinical indication antimicrobial therapy time randomization Anticipated duration mechanical ventilation great 48 hour Treatment drug device within 30 day prior study entry receive regulatory approval time study entry Does meet safety criterion bronchoscopic alveolar lavage either baseline anticipate high risk lavage Day 1 study Intubation cardiopulmonary arrest Intubation status asthmaticus , pulmonary embolus , myocardia infarction Anticipated survival le 48 hour intubation Anticipated survival le 28 day due preexist medical condition</criteria>
