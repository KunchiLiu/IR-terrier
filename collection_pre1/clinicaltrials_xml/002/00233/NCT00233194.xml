	<brief_title>Identification Sleep-Disordered Breathing Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) affect least 1 3 percent child . Associated morbidity include inattentive hyperactive behavior , disruptive behavior disorder , cognitive deficit , excessive daytime sleepiness . Sleep specialist recommend child undergo polysomnography confirm SDB , especially undergoing treatment , often involve adenotonsillectomy . Unfortunately , test rarely perform either surgery . Available data suggest clinical diagnosis SDB predict polysomnographic result reliably . However , extent polysomnographic result predict morbidity , especially treatable morbidity , well know . The main goal propose research , therefore , study improve method identification childhood SDB carry reversible morbidity . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Researchers examine utility polysomnography group child schedule undergo adenotonsillectomy clinical indication , group match control subject . Initial evaluation , surgery first group , compare result identical evaluation 6 month later control nonrandomized trial . Outcomes provide well-validated assessment behavior , psychiatric status , cognition , sleepiness . Explanatory variable include standard clinical polysomnographic information , data two new technique . The first , nasal pressure monitoring , show increase sensitivity event characterize SDB , result outcome data report use method child . The second innovative signal processing algorithm develop investigator show cortical electroencephalogram ( EEG ) activity change synchrony non-apneic respiratory cycle child SDB . Preliminary data suggest magnitude respiratory cycle-related EEG change ( RCREC ) vary SDB severity , diminish SDB treatment , improve prediction neurobehavioral outcome . The specific aim propose research show 1 ) nasal pressure monitoring , comparison standard measure airflow , improve prediction neurobehavioral response adenotonsillectomy ; 2 ) RCREC , comparison standard visually-scored EEG-based arousal , likewise ; 3 ) polysomnographic SDB measure , include nasal pressure monitoring RCREC , add useful information derive office-based assessment ; 4 ) polysomnography adenotonsillectomy identify clinically relevant residual SDB child .</detailed_description>
