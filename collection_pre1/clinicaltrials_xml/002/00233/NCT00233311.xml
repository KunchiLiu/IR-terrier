	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether eat fast food meal ( high saturate fat ) result great increase inflammatory marker eat meal low level saturate fat high level mono-unsaturated fat . This study first step learn dietary fat intake directly impact risk factor heart disease , diabetes obesity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fast Food Study : Assessment Effects Fast-Food Inflammatory Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At first visit , potential participant undergo screen examination , include laboratory test . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) perform baseline exclude participant evidence myocardial infarction . Each participant complete Food Intake Record ass typical dietary pattern . Cognitive status assess Mini-Mental Status Exam . The potential participant must acknowledge willingness consume two test meal design study . During visit 2 3 , participant undergo Oral Glucose Tolerance Test . The Fast Food Healthy Meals administer Visits 4,5,6 &amp; 7 . After fast least 8 hour , participant intravenous ( IV ) line place arm vein . Twenty minute allot participant complete experimental meal ( either fast food healthy meal ) . At end 20 minute , blood collect intravenous port eight-hour time period . Baseline blood sample also collect prior meal . The two mixed meal : 1 ) fast-food meal equivalent Big Mac Meal French fry milkshake ; 2 ) meal fat distribution fast-food meal fat derive mono-unsaturated fat source . A registered dietitian prepare meal . To prevent carry-over effect previous meal , participant ask fast overnight last meal light dinner later 12 hour schedule test . In addition , participant ask avoid high fat , high calorie meal course study . Participants give specific dietary guideline follow course study four day precede OGTT visit 2 . They ask complete diet diary adherence dietary recommendation monitor . All participant ask continue normal exercise routine exception exercise do 24 hour prior test session . During OGTT test session two meal , ECG continuously record use Holter monitor . The primary study hypothesis : - Administration different meal ( different nutrient composition ) cause differential increase circulate level inflammatory marker . Specifically , fast-food meal ( high saturate fat ) cause great increase circulate inflammatory marker , specifically C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , oral glucose mono-unsaturated fat meal . Also , difference inflammatory response explain parallel change circulate lipid level . - The inflammatory response within individual standard oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) meal reproducible 48-hour period . The secondary hypothesis : - Changes serum level glucose insulin follow standard oral glucose tolerance test predict change circulate level inflammatory marker meal</detailed_description>
