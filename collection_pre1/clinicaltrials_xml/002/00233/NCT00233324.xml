	<brief_summary>This study compare use continuous positive airway pressure initiate birth early administration surfactant administer tube windpipe within 1 hour birth premature infant bear 24 27 week gestation . In addition , infant within 2 hour birth , special pulse oximeter place continuously monitor oxygen saturation two different target range ( 85-89 % 91-95 % ) . This study help determine whether two management strategy affect chronic lung disease survival premature infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surfactant Positive Airway Pressure Pulse Oximetry Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study subject infant 24 0/7ths 27 6/7th week birth decision make provide full resuscitation require . Infants 27 week less gestation ( complete week best obstetric estimate ) enrol 80 % infant Network intubate , usually early neonatal course . The feasibility trial demonstrate five NICHD center involve could reduce intubation delivery room le 50 % infant intubate surfactant . We exclude infant 23 week less view extremely high mortality morbidity , almost universal need delivery room intubation resuscitation . Secondary study include : neuroimaging/MRI , growth , breathe outcome . Strata : There two randomization stratum , infant 24 0/7ths 25 6/7ths week , infant 26 0/7ths-27 6/7ths week best obstetrical estimate . Randomization : Randomization stratify gestational age group , occur prior delivery consent delivery , perform utilizing specially prepared double-sealed envelope . Deliveries randomize unit , thus multiple , twin , triplet , etc . randomize arm trial . Informed Consent : Parents approach prior delivery informed consent , infant enrol delivery . Study Intervention : Mode Ventilatory Support The intervention begin birth infant give resuscitation team . The conduct resuscitation follow usual guideline , stabilize , Control infants stratum receive prophylactic/early surfactant ( within one hour age ) , whereas Treatment infant place CPAP/PEEP follow stabilization , intubate resuscitation indication . Pulse Oximeter Allocation : Infants randomize receive either high- low-saturation peripheral oxygen ( SpO2 ) monitor study oximeter immediately follow NICU admission , maximum allowable delay two hour follow admission . The SUPPORT Trial recruitment temporarily pause November 23 , 2005 base concern regard pulse oximeter reading &gt; 95 % due concern regard separation two arm oximetry portion study . Further analyse perform show infant room air account significant portion pulse oximetry saturation 95 % . Separation two group reanalyzed base time spent room air duration time spend individual SpO2 value , show group difference . The trial restart February 6 , 2006 . Follow-up : Subjects see follow-up visit 18-22 month correct age look neurodevelopment . Extended follow-up : Subjects enrol Neuroimaging/MRI secondary study also see follow-up visit 6-7 year look later school-age development . Subjects attend 6-7 year follow-up visit invite participate secondary study analyze relationship salivary cortisol dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) : ( ) blood pressure adiposity ; ( b ) prenatal postnatal growth ; ( c ) DNA methylation pattern .</detailed_description>
