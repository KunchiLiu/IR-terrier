	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill cancer cell . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy peripheral stem cell transplant may allow chemotherapy give cancer cell kill . Tandem ( two ) autologous stem cell transplant may effective treatment Hodgkin 's lymphoma . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well tandem stem cell transplantation work treat patient progressive recurrent Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0410 Tandem Stem Cell Transplantation Treating Patients With Progressive Recurrent Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine 2-year progression-free survival patient progressive recurrent Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat tandem autologous stem cell transplantation ( 2 course high-dose therapy autologous stem cell rescue ) . - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine toxic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Salvage therapy ( patient relapse disease achieve previous complete response ) : Patients receive least 2 course salvage chemotherapy radiotherapy . No 6 week later , patient proceed autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection . - Autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection : Patients undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection . Patients inadequate number collect stem cell remove study . - Pre-transplant salvage radiation : Patients residual tumor great 5 cm initial salvage therapy undergo involved-field radiotherapy . All patient proceed first preparative regimen . - First preparative regimen : Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV day -1 . - First autologous stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) : Patients undergo autologous SCT day 0 . At least 28 day later , patient proceed second preparative regimen . - Second preparative regimen : Patients receive 1 follow preparative regimen : - Total-body irradiation ( TBI ) -based regimen : Patients undergo TBI twice daily day -8 -5 . Patients also receive etoposide IV 4 hour day -4 cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day -2 . - Carmustine-based regimen : Patients receive carmustine IV 2 hour day -6 -4 , etoposide IV 4 hour day -4 , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day -2 . - Second autologous SCT : Patients undergo second autologous SCT day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 7 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 85 patient accrue study 2 year .</detailed_description>
