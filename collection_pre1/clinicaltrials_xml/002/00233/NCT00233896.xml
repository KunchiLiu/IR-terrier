	<brief_summary>Patients gastrointestinal graft-vs.-host disease randomize oral beclomethasone dipropionate ( BDP ) 8 mg/day identical placebo tablet 50 day , along 10-day induction course prednisone . At study day 10 , patient whose symptom GVHD control undergo rapid prednisone taper 7 day , study drug continue study day 50 . After discontinuation study drug study day 50 , patient follow 30 additional day , study day 80 . The primary endpoint treatment failure day 50 , , flare symptom GVHD require immunosuppressive therapy . Secondary endpoint treatment failure day 80 , treatment-emergent adverse event , survival transplant day 200 . The hypothesis test topically-active corticosteroid ( beclomethasone dipropionate , BDP ) , take orally , would allow rapid taper prednisone maintain control intestinal GVHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study Oral Beclomethasone Dipropionate With Ten Days Prednisone Treatment Gastrointestinal GVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient selection . Patients develop symptom GVHD evaluate endoscopy mucosal biopsy . If biopsy specimen demonstrate histologic finding GVHD stool mucosal biopsy culture negative pathogen , patient invite participate . Patients exclude diarrhea exceeds one liter per day , skin liver GVHD present . All patient receive medication GVHD prophylaxis ; patient receive corticosteroid within 30 day study entry exclude . Patients sign informed consent document approve Institutional Review Boards . Formulation BDP . Immediate release tablets enteric-coated tablet , contain 1 mg BDP ( orBec , DOR BioPharma , Miami FL ) . The dose regimen one immediate release one enteric-coated tablet , take orally four time daily ( total daily dose , 8 mg BDP ) . Stratification randomization . A stratified allocation scheme use balance treatment group within study center . Stratifying variable HLA-matched sibling use cutaneous corticosteroid baseline . Patients receive either BDP identical placebo tablet . Treatment plan . Therapy consist study drug plus 10 day prednisone initial prednisone dose 1 mg/kg/day . In patient control GVHD symptom Study Day 10 , prednisone taper 7 day , patient maintain physiologic replacement dose prednisone . Patients demonstrate adequate control GVHD Study Day 10 consider treatment failure . Patients receive study drug 50 day , meet treatment failure endpoint , withdrawn study . Patients declare treatment failure study drug discontinue ; subsequent treatment GVHD dictate physician . Definitions treatment failure efficacy end-points . Treatment failure worsen recurrence GVHD require additional immunosuppressive therapy . The primary efficacy endpoint time treatment failure Study Day 50 . Secondary efficacy endpoint include time treatment failure Study Day 80 ( 30 day discontinuation study drug ) ; proportion experience treatment failure Study Days 10 , 30 , 50 , 80 ; overall survival rate day-200 day post-transplant . Evaluation drug safety adverse event . Safety assessment base cumulative prednisone exposure , incidence degree hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression , rate adverse event . Statistical method . Analysis time-to-treatment-failure endpoint overall survival rate day-200 post-transplant include randomized patient , base Kaplan-Meier method log-rank test , stratify source allograft . For endpoint , hazard ratio treatment estimate base Cox proportional hazard model include term treatment group . Time-to-treatment-failure right-censored patient discontinue study drug first 50 day without meet criterion treatment failure , provide reason discontinuation relate uncontrolled GVHD study drug-related toxicity . The cumulative probability treatment failure Study Days 10 , 30 , 50 , 60 , 80 estimate complement Kaplan-Meier estimator . The Z-test use compare rate treatment failure group time point . Sensitivity analyse perform use cumulative incidence method assess impact compete risk . The overall survival rate day-200 day post-transplant analyzed manner describe treatment failure rate . Because variable length time among patient transplant randomization , treatment define proportional hazard model time-dependent covariate . A counting process approach use construct risk set analysis . Multivariate model use determine risk reduction attribute BDP univariate model still present account subject- , disease- , transplant-related factor think modify patient ’ risk mortality 200-day period transplant . Hypothesis test primary secondary endpoint perform use two-sided significance level 0.05 . No adjustment make significance level inferential test secondary endpoint . All patient receive least one dose BDP placebo include assessment safety . Analyses do use SAS® ( version 8.2 ) R ( version 2.0.1 ) software .</detailed_description>
