	<brief_title>Defined Green Tea Catechin Extract Preventing Esophageal Cancer Patients With Barrett 's Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective study demonstrate safety ( i.e. , determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ) use Polyphenon E ( Poly E ) six-month period management patient Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE ) without low-grade dysplasia ( LGD ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate dose-related biologic effect pharmacodynamic property Poly E ( order decrease priority ) : II . Determine efficacy Poly E inhibit phosphorylation EGFR Her-2 akt esophageal mucosa . III . Determine pharmacodynamic profile Poly E constituent ( EGCG , EGC , EC ) esophageal tissue 6 month therapy use HPLC GC-MS. IV . Evaluate efficacy Poly E reduce stabilize metaplasia dysplasia esophageal Barrett 's mucosa use visual endoscopic measurement histological analysis . V. Determine efficacy Poly E modulate surrogate biomarkers esophageal mucosa - degree tetraploidy aneuploidy ; expression cyclin D1 , COX-2 , EGFR , Her-2 , akt , Ki-67 ; LOH 9p ( p16 ) 17p ( p53 ) ; apoptotic index . VI . Determine efficacy Poly E inhibit methylation p16 . VII . Determine efficacy Poly E modulate eicosanoid level ( include PGE2 ) lipoxygenase profile esophageal mucosa . The esophagus tube use swallow connects mouth stomach . Barrett 's esophagus condition tissue line esophagus abnormal . It develop people heartburn , reflux disease ( acid esophagus ) , esophagitis ( inflammation esophagus ) . Patients condition high risk develop type cancer esophagus call adenocarcinoma . Polyphenon E ( Poly E [ define green tea catechin extract ] ) low-caffeinated polyphenol mixture make green tea . Poly E contain chemical call Epigallocatechin-3 ( EGCG ) chemical call `` catechin . '' Research show green tea , Poly E , EGCG may effective prevent cancer . Poly E , use study , contain green tea , make product green tea . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . These procedure part regular care someone increase risk esophagus cancer . If recently , may need repeat . This study doctor . You complete physical exam , medical history review . You also routine blood test ( 2-3 tablespoon ) , well electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . If eligible take part study , choose take part , complete 1-month `` wash-out period . '' The `` wash-out period '' period must take medication , herb , vitamins mineral supplement contain tea compound . The `` wash-out '' 30-day period baseline endoscopy . Because caffeine tea may affect result trial , ask drink tea-containing product . You also ask record amount caffeine-containing food medication consume . You give list caffeine-containing food medication . After `` wash-out '' period , need complete endoscopy biopsy esophagus . This part regular care someone increase risk esophagus cancer . This procedure perform outpatient setting . An endoscopy exam use doctor look esophagus ( tube connects mouth stomach ) stomach . Your doctor place thin scope mouth carefully move scope esophagus stomach . During endoscopy , standard biopsy , small area abnormal tissue `` snip '' . The sample send lab look chemical structural make-up cell esophageal lining . This test use find extent Barrett 's Esophagus . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test within 2 week assign treatment group . You randomly assign ( roll dice ) computer one 4 study group . You equal chance place group . Neither doctor choose group . Neither , research staff , doctor know take Poly E placebo capsule . In study , get either define green tea catechin extract ( 1 3 different dos ) placebo ( harmless drug look like study drug medical benefit ) . If assign Group 1 ( `` Arm I '' ) , begin take 1 capsule define green tea catechin extract orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) next 6 month . If assign Group 2 ( `` Arm II '' ) , begin take 2 capsule define green tea catechin extract PO BID next 6 month . If assign Group 3 ( `` Arm III '' ) , begin take 3 capsule define green tea catechin extract PO BID next 6 month . If assign Group 4 ( `` Arm IV '' ) , begin take 1-3 capsule placebo PO BID next 6 month . The number take group depend amount EGCG assign receive . Each 200 mg Poly E capsule contain 200 mg EGCG . The dosage Poly E base EGCG content . The study capsule contain green tea . You ask keep study diary entire participation study . In diary , record exactly take dose study drug , much take time . You also ask record amount caffeine-containing food medication consume . You may continue histamine antagonist ( example , Zantac Tagamet ) proton pump inhibitor ( example , Nexium Prilosec ) symptom may . Certain test procedure perform study , see treatment affect body . These test do every 2 week first month , month completion 6 month treatment . You 20-minute follow-up visit , include check side effect count write much medication take . You blood draw ( 2-3 tablespoon ) routine test , also urine test ( 1 sample less 1 tablespoon ) . Patients Barrett 's esophagus usually endoscopy every 1-3 year . For study , perform twice ( first visit 6-month visit ) . You sign separate consent form endoscopy . You take aspirin , aspirin-containing substance , coumadin ( warfarin ) , heparin , iron supplement 5 day endoscopy . You may take study intolerable side effect occur , study doctor believe best interest , follow study rule , sponsor decides stop study reason . When finish take 6 month `` treatment '' ( either Poly E placebo ) , follow-up endoscopy biopsy . You follow-up visit schedule 3 month 6 month complete treatment . During visit , check side effect , blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test , also urine test ( 1 sample less 1 tablespoon ) perform . You contact telephone monthly completing treatment , check side effect may experience . This investigational study . Poly E authorize use research . Up 55 participant take part multicenter study . About 12 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
