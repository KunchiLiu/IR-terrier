	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : African Americans ( AA ) high prevalence hypertension ( HTN ) U.S. , resultant great HTN-related mortality compare white . Barriers BP Control AA exist 3 level care : patient , physician , healthcare system . Using Chronic Care Model framework , investigator seek test effect BP control multicomponent , multi-level intervention target physician patient . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Using Chronic Care Model framework , investigator seek test effect BP control multicomponent , multi-level intervention target physician patient . They conduct cluster randomize control trial 30 C/MHCs randomize either intervention usual care . A total 990 patient uncontrolled HTN ( BP great 140/90 mm Hg ) enrol trial . Components patient intervention include innovative patient education approach know Self-Paced Programmed Instruction use educate patient knowledge HTN ; behavioral counseling train C/MHC dietician lifestyle modification ; home BP monitoring activate patient care . The physician intervention comprise online continue medical education ( CME ) course management HTN base Joint National Committee-7 ( JNC-7 ) guideline ; online HTN round case conference HTN specialist ; feedback physician clinical performance measure via computerized decision support system . The intervention deliver patient every 3 month regular office visit 12 month , physician intervention occur every month duration trial . Patients physicians usual care C/MHCs receive NHLBI patient education material print version JNC-7 guideline respectively . The primary outcome proportion patient adequate BP control 12 month condition define JNC-7 criterion ( BP le 130/80 mm Hg patient diabetes kidney disease ; BP le 140/90 mm Hg patient ) . The secondary outcome within-patient change systolic BP diastolic BP baseline 12 month ; maintenance intervention effect one year trial ; cost effectiveness intervention 12 month . The long-term goal project refine intervention result data obtain develop standardized protocol integrate usual care procedure C/MHCs . Thus , maximize likelihood intervention translate practice , participate Community Health Centers .</detailed_description>
