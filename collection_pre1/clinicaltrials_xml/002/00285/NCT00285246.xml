	<brief_summary>Background : Previous deployment like Persian Gulf 1991 produce veteran post-deployment symptom-based health problem medical explanation . This term Gulf War illness medically unexplained illness ( MUI ) . If previous war indication , soldier currently deploy hostile area also return home unexplained symptom-based illness . However , study begin virtually pre-war , prospective data risk resilience factor associate MUI . This study attempt fill gap . Objectives : Our goal : ( ) determine pre- immediate post-deployment factor predict later MUI poor functional status , ( b ) improve previous methodological problem ( e.g. , selection bias , recall bias lack baseline control ) study MUI , ( c ) relate pre-deployment risk factor ( e.g. , personality , stressor reactivity ) resilience factor ( e.g. , cop style , social support ) post-deployment functional status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Previous deployment like Persian Gulf 1991 produce veteran post-deployment symptom-based health problem medical explanation . This term Gulf War illness medically unexplained illness ( MUI ) . If previous war indication , soldier currently deploy hostile area also return home unexplained symptom-based illness . However , virtually pre-war , prospective data risk resilience factor associate MUI 2001 . This study attempt fill gap . Objectives : Our goal : ( ) determine pre- immediate post-deployment factor predict later MUI poor functional status , ( b ) improve previous methodological problem ( e.g. , selection bias , recall bias lack baseline control ) study MUI , ( c ) relate pre-deployment risk factor ( e.g. , personality , stressor reactivity ) resilience factor ( e.g. , cop style , social support ) post-deployment functional status . Methods : This study use prospective , longitudinal observational design ass risk resilience factor post-war MUI Reserve National Guard enlist personnel . A stratified random sample 700 subject draw undergoing pre- post-mobilization readiness process Fort Dix , NJ Camp Shelby , MS . Personnel test pre-mobilization ( Phase 1 ) , immediately mobilization ( Phase 2 ) 3 month 1 year post-deployment ( Phases 3 &amp; 4 ) . Predictor variable include personality , social support , cop style , non-specific symptom , sympathetic cardiac stress reactivity , cortisol stress reactivity . Control variables include prior traumatic event , current distress , PTSD symptom , socially desirable responding , body mass index , deployment experience , environmental exposure demographic ( e.g. , age , gender ) . Outcome variable include functional status , healthcare utilization , MUI status ( use CDC criterion chronic multisymptom illness develop first Gulf War ) . Status : Publications presentation prepare . Impact : The large , prospective study soldier help u identify pre- early post-deployment risk resilience factor important MUI , functional status , healthcare utilization . There urgent need pre- post-deployment predictor later MUI uncontaminated recall bias , selection bias study treatment-seekers . If understand best treat veteran present unexplained symptom , need know pre-war factor useful predict likely resilient likely risk later unexplained illness .</detailed_description>
