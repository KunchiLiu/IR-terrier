	<brief_title>The Effect Contrast Media Erythrocytes Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The influence several radiological contrast medium erythrocyte morphology function investigate past ( 1 ) . However , publish data sparse include assessment iso-osmolar agent compare low-osmolar agent . In addition , effect injection contrast medium high temperature ( i.e . &gt; room body temperature ) , may beneficial rapid injection viscous contrast medium multi detector-row CT angiography , never evaluate . We intend assess hypothesis , iso-osmolar contrast medium ( i.e . Visipaque ) exert less effect erythrocyte morphology function compare low-osmolar agent . In addition , intend identify upper temperature limit , contrast medium inject , without affect erythrocyte integrity . Subjects tp 400 mLs ( approximately 26 tablespoon ) blood drawn . The blood keep body temperature petri dish similar container expose contrast medium ( dye ) .</detailed_description>
