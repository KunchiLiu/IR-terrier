	<brief_summary>This prospective , multi-center , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial determine efficacy safety mycophenolate mofetil ( MM ) combination prednisone initial form immunosuppression patient acquire myasthenia gravis ( MG ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mycophenolate Mofetil Myasthenia Gravis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>80 patient seropositive MG 18 academic center randomize 3 month treatment 2.5 gm MM/day ( 1,250 mg q 12 hour , +/- 2 hour ) plus 20 mg prednisone/day versus placebo plus 20 mg/day prednisone . The primary measure efficacy change baseline Quantitative MG ( QMG ) score end 3 month . Secondary outcome measure include survival analysis treatment failure , MG-related impairment daily activity , functional assessment , manual muscle testing , SF-36 Health Status , serum concentration antibody acetylcholine receptor . Study completers option take open-label MM additional 6 month , prednisone reduce low dose necessary maintain optimum clinical response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion 1 . Acquired generalized MG diagnose one Principal Investigators base : Examination site PI show myasthenic weakness limit ocular periocular muscle . Elevated acetylcholine receptor antibody . Positive edrophonium chloride test abnormal neuromuscular transmission demonstrate single fiber EMG repetitive nerve stimulation . 2 . Aged least 18 . 3 . Able give inform consent . 4 . Taking constant dose Mestinon least 2 week . 5 . Symptom severity would , judgment site investigator , justify initiation immunosuppressive treatment . 6 . Able willing comply study requirement . Exclusion criteria 1 . Thymoma past . 2 . Plasma exchange IVIG treatment within 90 day randomization . 3 . Treatment azathioprine , cyclosporine , mycophenolate mofetil , immunosuppressive medication since onset MG . Treatment prednisone corticosteroid within previous 90 day . â€¢ Exception : patient may take dos immunosuppressant medication judge Principal Investigator clinically insignificant , i.e . unlikely produce improvement MG. 4 . Women childbearing potential pregnant , breastfeed practice effective contraception . 5 . Renal failure , active thyroid hepatocellular disease , chronic infection , poorly control cardiac disease , illness , include psychiatric disease , would , opinion treat physician , make unsafe patient participate would interfere interpretation study result . 6 . Weakness affect ocular periocular muscle ( Myasthenia Gravis Foundation America Class I ) . 7 . Severe weakness predominantly affect oropharyngeal , respiratory muscle ( MGFA Class IVB ) . 8 . Crisis impend crisis ( define FVC &lt; 10ml/Kg bulbar weakness severe enough compromise airway protection . ) 9 . Hemoglobin &lt; 10mg/dl ; WBC &lt; 3,500 . 10 . History noncompliance treatment office visit . 11 . Thymectomy within 12 month randomization . 12 . Concurrent medical condition would pose unacceptable risk immunosuppression , include positive skin test tuberculosis ( PPD ) , unless patient previously receive appropriate treatment .</criteria>
