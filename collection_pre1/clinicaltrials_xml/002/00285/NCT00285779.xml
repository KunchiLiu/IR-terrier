	<brief_summary>The purpose assess response subject etanercept ( compare placebo ) treat physical sign mucosal cutaneous lichen planus . The investigator also wish ass effect etanercept disease-related itching , pain , serious adverse event patient lichen planus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Etanercept Treatment Moderate Severe Lichen Planus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lichen planus affect 1 % worldwide population . Recent estimate suggest approximately 0.44 % US population suffers disease . Oral genital involvement occur 60-70 % patient , may sole manifestation disease 20-30 % patient . Lichen planus mucocutaneous disorder involve skin , oral genital mucosa , conjunctiva , nail . On skin , disease present multiple papule , localize generalize , often extremely itchy . Mucosal disease consist either asymptomatic plaque extremely painful erosive lesion . The disease course unpredictable typically last 1-2 year follow chronic , relapse course . Erosive mucosal disease important aggressively treat many reason : First , associate pain debilitate patient . Patients severe oral lichen planus become malnourished due pain associate eating . Vulvar disease cause dyspareunia , burn pain , discharge ; second , disease tend chronic , little chance self-resolution ; third , erosive disease associate increase risk squamous cell carcinoma affect area . These cancer occur 1 % patient 3-year period , aggressive even-life threaten patient recognize treat early . Several line evidence suggest TNF-alpha play role pathogenesis lichen planus . It show increased level TNF-alpha serum patient . In addition , skin mucosal biopsy show increased TNF-alpha produce infiltrate lymphocyte well basal keratinocytes . It suggest expression TNF-alpha receptor basal keratinocytes may contribute apoptosis . Also , TNFR1 ( TNF-alpha receptor ) express infiltrate mononuclear cell well keratinocytes . Increased level soluble TNF receptor also find serum patient lichen planus . A recent report also show polymorphisms TNF-alpha gene associate oral cutaneous lichen planus . Finally , thalidomide , partly function potent inhibitor TNF-alpha transcription , show effective ( small case series report ) select patient treatment oral genital lichen planus . However , thalidomide potent teratogen use woman childbearing potential . In addition , thalidomide usage uncommonly result neurotoxicity , permanent , thus limit use drug . Despite evidence role TNF-alpha LP report TNF inhibitor use disease . This double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study observe safety efficacy etanercept patient lichen planus . This study consist 3 period : first , double-blind period ( week 0-12 ) subject randomize etanercept 50 mg twice weekly placebo ; second , open-label period ( week 12-24 ) subject randomize placebo treatment , achieve complete remission , roll use etanercept 50 mg twice weekly . Subjects previously receive etanercept week 0-12 , achieve complete remission , continue etanercept low dosage 25 mg twice weekly week 12-24 ; third , 8 week follow-up period subject .</detailed_description>
