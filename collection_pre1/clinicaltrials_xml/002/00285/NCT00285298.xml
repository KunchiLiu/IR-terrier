	<brief_summary>The purpose investigator study assess impact therapy Pentoxifylline ( PTF ) , nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor , kidney function patient high-risk progression end-stage renal disease . The investigator hypothesize therapy Pentoxifylline slow progression kidney disease time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pentoxifylline Progression Chronic Kidney Disease Moderate-to-high Risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment objective chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , regardless etiology , slow halt progression renal dysfunction reduce proteinuria ( patient proteinuric renal disease ) . Multi-drug medical regimen remain cornerstone therapy medical-renal disease , often angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin receptor blocker . These therapy , though often efficacious , show halt disease progression entirely , medical therapy renal disease remain suboptimal . PTF safe , generally well-tolerated drug currently indicate symptomatic functional relief intermittent claudication presume due chronic occlusive arterial disease limb . A number small study patient across range renal disease state show PTF reduce proteinuria , important component treatment CKD . It know , however , drug slow progression CKD measure glomerular filtration rate . Comparisons : subject randomize receive PTF compare randomize receive placebo</detailed_description>
