	<detailed_description>This observational research study conduct determine modify bone mineral density ( BMD ) test report contain additional fracture risk information useful physician decision aide select patient pharmacological osteoporosis therapy . It hypothesize supplementary information , provide addition conventional BMD report , increase likelihood patient high risk osteoporotic fracture receive prescribe therapy osteoporosis . Physicians receive conventional BMD report without supplemental information control group . To compare rate pharmacological intervention osteoporosis post-menopausal woman , family / primary care physicians randomize receive either : ( ) conventional BMD report ( absolute bone density , T-score result , Z-score result , qualitative statement indicate BMD result classification risk fracture osteoporosis accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion ) versus ( ii ) conventional BMD report plus supplemental information sheet ( information contain conventional BMD report plus five-year estimated risk future fracture calculate physician-supplied clinical risk factor - osteoporosis accord WHO criteria - number need treat ( person year ) prevent one fracture .</detailed_description>
