	<brief_summary>This study examine use variation standard magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) call diffusion tensor MRI ( DT-MRI ) distinguishing injured brain tissue due radiation therapy ( radiation necrosis ) return brain tumor previously remove ( tumor recurrence ) . DT-MRI differs standard MRI way computer process image ; difference experience procedure do . Both radiation necrosis tumor recurrence occur within week month follow brain radiation treatment . Because treatment management option two condition differ significantly , distinguish two critical importance . Currently , surgical biopsy require make differentiation . Healthy volunteer patient receive radiation therapy part treatment brain tumor may eligible study . All candidate must least 21 year old . Patients must new area abnormality require biopsy determine whether tumor recurrence radiation necrosis . Candidates screen medical history physical examination . In addition , patient blood urine test . All participant undergo MRI DT-MRI . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave instead X-rays obtain image body organ tissue . The MRI scanner metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . During MRI , subject lie table slide cylinder wear earplugs muffle loud knocking noise occur scan . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 40-60 minute . Subjects may ask lie still 20 minute time . DT-MRI type MRI measure water move brain tissue . This technique use MRI machine conventional MRI , diffusion image obtain normal MRI scan , computer program instal machine . This complete participation healthy subject . In addition scan , patient undergo brain biopsy abnormal area identify MRI . Patients ' commitment study protocol fulfil surgery complete ; may , however , continue receive follow-up care NIH Clinical Center complete study . They give result biopsy treatment , necessary , arrange .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diffusion Tensor MRI Distinguish Brain Tumor Recurrence From Radiation Necrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The common major side effect radiation therapy treatment primary brain tumor necrosis normal brain tissue ( radiation necrosis ) . Radiation necrosis typically occur week month follow treatment . The diagnosis suspect patient new area gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Tumor recurrence also occur within week month follow treatment represent new area gadolinium enhancement well . As management option radiation necrosis tumor recurrence significantly different , distinguish two critical importance . Conventional MRI , diffusion-weighted MRI ( DW-MRI ) , MR spectroscopy , SPECT , PET image used try make distinction , sensitivity specificity technique clinically useful . Most patient must therefore undergo risky diagnostic surgical procedure . Diffusion tensor MRI ( DT-MRI ) image technique provide information regard diffusive property water well directionality water movement . A modification DT-MRI , refer two-compartment DT-MRI , appear sensitive variation MRI diagnosis select type brain abnormality . Objective : We plan conduct feasibility study determine two-compartment DT-MRI distinguish tumor recurrence radiation necrosis . Study Population : Patients age great equal twenty one year old prior diagnosis primary brain tumor history radiation treatment develop new area gadolinium enhancement conventional MRI scan require surgery diagnostic therapeutic purpose evaluate enrollment study . Ten patient control also undergo DT-MRI scan purpose obtain normative data quantitative study . Design : Patients meet eligibility criterion undergo two compartment DT-MRI scan . Regions abnormality identify surgical biopsy obtain region . The radiographic histologic characteristic sample correlate . Volunteers undergo DT-MRI scan . Outcome Measure : The primary outcome measure study degree agreement radiographically predict diagnosis tumor recurrence radiation necrosis use two-compartment DT-MRI histologic diagnosis . This outcome measure proportion instance two modality identify particular lesion tumor recurrence radiation necrosis . The information gather study allow implementation large study patient high degree agreement two compartment DT-MRI histologic diagnose surgical biopsy specimen . The long range goal large study radiographically diagnose tumor recurrence radiation necrosis high enough level sensitivity specificity avoid diagnostic surgical procedure attendant risk .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must : Have histologically confirm glioma , radiation therapy previously administer . Be able undergo MRI scan brain . Have contrast enhancing lesion amendable surgical biopsy and/or resection . Be appropriate operative procedure determine neurosurgeon anesthesiologist . Ten patient control include study foster technical development acquisition normative data . Patient control define unilateral abnormality previously obtain MRI scan , radiation treatment . Be great equal 21 year age . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must : Have follow : aneurysm clip , implanted neural stimulator , implanted cardiac pacemaker auto defibrillator , cochlear implant , ocular foreign body implant ( e.g . metal shaving , retinal clip ) , insulin pump item would contraindications undergoing MRI scan . Be poor operative candidate anesthetic point view secondary major medical illness risk undergo general anesthesia outweigh potential benefit clinical information gain surgical biopsy/resection . Have coagulopathy demonstrate abnormal prothrombin time , activate partial thromboplastin time , thrombocytopenia ( platelet count le 150,000 platelets/mm3 ) risk develop uncontrollable intraoperative bleeding outweigh potential benefit clinical information gain surgical biopsy/resection . Significant psychiatric impairment , opinion investigator , interfere proper administration completion protocol self explanatory . Acute untreated infection ( viral , bacterial fungal ) patient active infection highly likely spread infection brain result biopsy/resection . Be pregnant time treatment Women pregnant nursing exclude protocol . Therefore , woman childbearing potential pregnancy test perform , must negative , proceed . General anesthesia surgery may subject fetus unacceptable risk . Also , NIH offer full obstetrical service event medical care mother and/or fetus require .</criteria>
