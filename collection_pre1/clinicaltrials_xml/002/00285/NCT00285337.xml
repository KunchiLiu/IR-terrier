	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study compare anterior posterior surgical approach treatment CSM term surgical complication neurological , functional , disease-specific quality life outcomes measure . Secondary aim quantify amount change pre post-surgery concern outcome measure ; determine difference outcomes posterior surgical technique ( i.e . laminectomy fusion laminoplasty ) examine relationship baseline MRI baseline follow-up neurological functional outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Narrowing spinal canal osteophyte , ossification posterior longitudinal ligament , bulge large central disk compress cervical spinal cord impinge spinal nerve root , result neck pain various degree neurological symptom impairment.2 In severe case , lead stenosis cervical spine , result upper motor neuron symptom low extremity lower motor neuron symptom upper extremity . When conservative measure traction , cervical collar , postural exercise fail prevent neurologic progression , surgery may indicate . A variety surgical approach procedure available , optimal choice treatment remain controversial . Surgical procedure design decompress spinal cord , case , stabilize spine show successful , persistent percentage patient improve surgical intervention.3 Additionally , potential complication surgery CSM may depend various method surgical management . Historically , cervical laminectomy , posterior approach , regarded standard surgical treatment CSM . However , past 20 year , increasingly recognize laminectomy without fusion appropriate patient may result instability deformity . Because instability cause laminectomy , alternate surgical approach anterior approach spine laminoplasty develop , gain increase popularity years.3 A range factor must consider decide surgical technique use . Surgeons often challenge determine appropriate technique limited information whether difference surgical procedure term clinical radiographic outcome , postoperative complication rate functional quality life outcome . Methods treatment include conservative surgical management . Among surgically manage patient , anterior posterior approach may employ . Among manage posteriorly , laminoplasty laminectomy fusion common surgical technique . With several standard care available population , good understand correspond positive negative outcome respect clinical patient-centered outcome warrant .</detailed_description>
