	<brief_summary>Thiazolidinedione derivates ( TZD 's ) Peroxisome-Proliferator-Activated-Receptor-γ agonist ( PPARγ-agonists ) enhance insulin sensitivity . One side effect , however , fact subject treat drug seem prone fluid retention . The precise mechanism rosiglitazone-related fluid retention unknown , clear either primary secondary renal sodium retention part mechanism . Furthermore observational study , TZD-related oedema seem resistant loop diuretic therapy . The recent find rosiglitazone induces upregulation epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) kidney could explanation TZD-related fluid retention observe resistance loop diuretic . In present human in-vivo study follow hypothesis test : Rosiglitazone treatment stimulate activity ENaC distal nephron , enhance natriuretic effect amiloride decrease natriuretic effect furosemide parallel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence Rosiglitazone Diuretic Effect Furosemide Amiloride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , single-centre , cross-over study 4 week wash compare placebo rosiglitazone 4 mg bid 9 week treatment period . Randomization treatment sequence computer-generated , sequentially drive allocation . Randomization blind perform department Clinical Pharmacy . After 8 ( furosemide ) 9 ( amiloride ) week period end-point experiment perform . During visit ( week 0 , 4 , 8 , 9 ) period , adverse event pill compliance record . In addition , physical examination , foot volume bio-impedance measurement perform safety chemical , hematological profile determine . Only start 8 week period , glucose , insulin HbA1c measure . All visit intervention perform Clinical Research Center Nijmegen ( CRCN ) . Furosemide end-point experiment Each participant attend hospital 8 a.m. overnight fast abstinence alcohol caffeine 20 hour , deliver 24-hour urine collection present morning voiding . The previous three day participant adhere individualize diet contain 150 mmol sodium 80 mmol potassium prescribe dietician . First , blood collect measure fast glucose insulin concentration . Then subject give individualized breakfast include 1 cup water . Afterwards brachial vein cannulate connected Braunpump ( 10 ml/hr NaCl 0.9 % ) , follow blood draw safety vascular hormone measurement ( aldosterone , Atrial Natriuretic Peptide ( ANP ) , Brain Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) , Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) renin ) . A bolus furosemide ( 40 mg ) inject small cannule vein contra-lateral arm , bladder emptying . Venous blood sample draw 0 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90,120 , 150 , 180 , 240 , 300 , 360 , 420 480 minute bolus injection measure plasma furosemide level . The participant ask urinate regularly , least hourly . The exact time void urine volume record . Two urine sample take . In one sample , sodium creatinine concentration measure sample light-protected immediately frozen measurement furosemide level later . To prevent dehydration participant ask drink tap water equal volume diuresis previous hour . During test participant sit bed . At noon participant offer individualized lunch . After 8 hour participant leave hospital instruction adhere diet without fluid restriction collect urine 24 hour start experiment . Amiloride end-point experiment Until amiloride infusion procedure similar . At time point 0 , venous infusion load dose amiloride start ( 150 μg/kg 60 minute ) follow maintenance infusion ( 0.20 μg/kg/min ) 4 hour . Amiloride obtain sterile powder form amiloride HCl/2H2O . Directly use , powder dissolve NaCl 0,9 % concentration 1 mg/ml solution filter 0.22 μm Millipore filter . Venous blood measurement amiloride concentration sample 60 , 180 , 300 420 minute . All procedure similar furosemide experiment . Pharmacokinetic consideration amiloride-dose The peak plasma level 3-4 hour intake 10 20 mg amiloride 20 μg/L ( 32 ) 38-40 μg/L respectively ( 33 ) . These concentration well half maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) amiloride Na+/H+ Na+/Ca2+-transporters α1-receptor , well IC50 ENaC ( 34 ) . Using pharmacokinetic characteristic amiloride ( 35 ) calculate require amiloride infusion order reach steady-state concentration 30-45 μg/L . Exosome extraction : Urinary exosomes isolated ultracentrifugation ENaC abundance measure immunoblotting previously describe ( 19 ; 36 ) normalize urine creatinine level . 4 µg protein lysed Laemmli buffer load 8 % SDS-PAGE . PAGE , blot block PVDF membrane do previously describe . Membrane incubate 1:4000-diluted affinity-purified rabbit α-ENaC antibody ( Rossier BC , Lausanne , Switzerland ) , follow 1:5,000-diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG 's secondary antibody couple horseradish peroxidase . Blotting signal visualize use enhanced chemiluminescence . The sample normalize expression level α-ENaC placebo treatment indicated percentage .</detailed_description>
