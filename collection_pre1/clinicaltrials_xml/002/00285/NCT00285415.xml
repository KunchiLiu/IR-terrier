	<detailed_description>Endometrial carcinoma common malignancy female reproductive tract . For percentage patient advanced stage ( III - IV ) optimum adjuvant therapy status-post surgical staging and/or optimal cytoreductive surgery well define limited rate response . Survival rate range 18 - 49 % high level toxicity current treatment regimen . ( 1 ) The Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) explore use chemotherapy protocol # 107 compare adriamycin combination adriamycin cisplatin . ( 2 ) This trial boast 45 % response rate combination arm compare 27 % response rate adriamycin arm . Although difference see overall survival , combination arm show improvement progression free survival 3.8 5.7 month . Subsequently , GOG protocol # 122 randomized patient chemotherapeutic regimen versus whole abdominal radiation therapy . This trial close accrual result pending . Ball et . al . report phase II trial paclitaxel advance recurrent endometrial cancer do GOG . ( 3 ) At 250 mg/m2 ( 200mg/m2 patient previous radiation therapy ) 24 hour , every 21 day , 10/28 patient respond . There 4 complete responder 6 partial responder overall response rate 35.7 % . Toxicity remarkably high grade 3 4 neutropenia neurotoxicity see 62 % 10.7 % , respectively . Dimpoulos et . al . report use paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 3 hour cisplatin 75mg/m2 every 21 day advance recurrent endometrial carcinoma . ( 4 ) A 67 % objective response rate see 29 % show complete response 38 % partial response . Toxicities include 9 % grade 3 4 peripheral neuropathy rate . These response rate change standard care community set toxic regimen adriamycin cisplatin paclitaxel carboplatin . Hoskins et . al . substitute carboplatin cisplatin effort reduce peripheral neuropathy see Dimpoulos trial . This phase II combination paclitaxel carboplatin radiation therapy advance endometrial cancer result 75 % response rate . The median failure-free survival time 23 month , 62 % 3-year overall survival rate . Toxicities primarily hematologic reversible . ( 5 ) The ongoing GOG protocol , # 184 , explore combination tumor direct radiation follow randomization adriamycin cisplatin versus adriamycin , cisplatin paclitaxel G-CSF support . Increased toxicity expect three-drug regimen . With significant response rate combination paclitaxel carboplatin along radiation therapy phase II set hard justify add toxicity three-drug regimen . The SCOTROC phase III trial compare docetaxel ( 75 mg/m2 ) 1 hour plus carboplatin ( AUC 6 ) vs. paclitaxel ( 175 mg/m2 ) 3 hour plus carboplatin ( AUC 6 ) yield equivalent overall response rate 1,077 patient ovarian cancer . ( 6 ) The docetaxel arm result significantly less overall grade 2 3 sensory motor neurotoxicity . Only 4 patient withdrew trial due neurotoxicity docetaxel arm vs. 32 patient paclitaxel arm . However , docetaxel arm result high incidence neutropenia associate complication without compromise treatment delivery overall safety . Based information date , seem prudent explore phase II trial docetaxel plus carboplatin every 3 week 6 cycle follow radiation therapy management patient advance endometrial cancer . The propose protocol design require chemotherapy administer prior radiation therapy order control distant metastatic disease attempt control local-regional recurrence radiation .</detailed_description>
