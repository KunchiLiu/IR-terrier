	<brief_summary>In malaria-endemic area , young child especially high risk malaria morbidity mortality . Malaria estimate cause 2 million death 500 million clinical episode Africa alone . The bulk disease Africa severe disease death globally due P. falciparum . However , P. vivax also responsible substantial disease burden endemic region outside Africa , P. vivax may account half malaria case . Efforts reduce unacceptably high disease burden hamper limited availability affordable intervention . Following cessation large-scale vector control highly endemic area , malaria control effort centre early diagnosis treatment clinical case reduce exposure use insecticide-treated net ( ITNs ) . While ITNs show significantly reduce burden malaria additional effective intervention urgently need . Several trial show chemoprophylaxis give child weekly fortnightly interval reduces morbidity malaria number different setting population . An alternative approach use intermittent preventive therapy ( IPT ) involve administration full therapeutic dose antimalarial regular interval . This logistically easy deliver , less costly , may reduce problem promote drug resistance associate regular chemoprophylaxis . Intermittent administration sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) antenatal clinic visit show highly effective reduce malaria anaemia pregnant woman improve infant birth weight . IPT pregnancy ( IPTp ) recommend WHO endemic region Africa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intermittent preventive treatment infancy ( IPTi ) one promise recent intervention reduce devastate impact malaria early childhood . Although two African study provide proof principle , study need address several key issue . IPTi need additional evaluation variety setting population , alternative drug treatment schedule need test long-term effect IPTi risk malaria illness early childhood need clarify . Many issue currently address series study conduct auspice IPTi Consortium . However , study base sub-Saharan Africa thus almost exclusively concerned potential IPTi prevent P. falciparum malaria . In order determine whether IPTi also effective intervention area high prevalence non-falciparum infection , study outside Africa urgently need . In addition , although initial IPTi study show rebound malaria morbidity follow intervention , influence IPTi acquisition functional malaria immunity need investigation . This proposal bring together investigator , experience , resource conduct clinical trial IPTi complement careful epidemiologic laboratory investigation two highly endemic area Papua New Guinea , infections 4 human Plasmodium specie common . The study base PNG Institute Medical Research , excellent infrastructure strong history malaria research community-based study</detailed_description>
