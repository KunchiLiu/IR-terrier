	<detailed_description>Following initial telephone screen assess inclusion exclusion criterion , evaluation continue in-person evaluation ass presence absence active medical history history major psychiatric illness , well review consent document . If find eligible , participant would admit study . The next step eligible , consent depressed subject healthy control baseline hospital visit baseline MRI . The baseline hospital visit last 4 hour . We begin baseline visit collect urine sample drug ( , woman , pregnancy ) test . As long negative , collect blood sample 135cc . After blood draw , participant complete cognitive test meet study psychiatrist . Participants also complete baseline Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) brain Veteran 's Affairs ( VA ) Hospital San Francisco . After baseline hospital visit MRI , depressed subject ( healthy control ) begin take FDA approve antidepressant , prescribed study psychiatrist , next 8 week enrol study . The specific drug decide upon participant study psychiatrist in-person screening visit . After 4 week , depress participant return UCSF meet psychiatrist discus symptom continue treatment ; visit , another blood draw 135cc ( blood draw baseline ) . Healthy control return week 4 blood draw . 4 week later ( 8 week total ) , bring depress healthy participant back additional visit include blood draw , test , MRI baseline visit . A physician-investigator meet depressed subject review clinical response treatment make treatment suggestion , subject may use discussion future treatment option personal physician . If decision make discontinue antidepressant treatment , subject give instruction withdraw medication , give 4 week supply drug facilitate withdrawal .</detailed_description>
