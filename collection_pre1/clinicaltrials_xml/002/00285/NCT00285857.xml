	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Lovastatin Breast Cancer Chemoprevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study evaluate 6-month course oral lovastatin 80 mg/day ( 40 mg twice-a-day ) would decrease abnormal breast duct cytology woman high inherit breast cancer risk . Breast duct cytology assess hyperplasia hyperplasia atypia , measure random periareolar fine needle aspiration ( rpFNA ) , breast duct cell . A stratified analysis objective perform accord BRCA mutation status ( absence presence inherit deleterious BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation ) . Additional objective study : - Assess change mammographic density , know associate breast cancer risk , treatment lovastatin - Asess incidence breast cancer new high-risk breast lesion , include atypical hyperplasia , ductal lobular carcinoma situ , radial scar . - Assess change breast cancer risk-associated biomarkers rpFNA specimen , include : - Ki-67 ( marker cell proliferation ) - Estrogen receptor ( ER ) - Progesterone receptor ( PR ) - HER/2-neu over-expression - Susceptibility DNA damage</detailed_description>
