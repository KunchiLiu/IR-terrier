	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Entrapment median nerve wrist common cause sensory motor disturbance hand progressively disabling.1,2 Complex mechanism compression ischemia exist adversely influence large A myelinated fiber small unmyelinated nociceptive C fiber . From pathophysiological standpoint , neuropathic pain ( numbness , tingle burning , NP ) believe secondary ectopic fire nociceptive afferent unmyelinated C-fiber axon undergo degeneration.3 Microneurography confirm dysregulated expression sodium calcium channel , accumulate site injury , responsible ectopic depolarization.3,4,53,54 When conventional therapy splint pharmacotherapy fail , surgical decompression offer moderate-severe case . While usually successful , associated significant complication , limitation costs.5,6,7 Thus , search reliable new therapeutic strategy appeal . Substantial evidence exist time-varying magnetic field produce biological effect safely induce extremely low-frequency ( ELF ) small electrical eddy current within tissue depolarize , repolarize hyperpolarize neurons.8,9,10,11,12 Prior pilot data use static13 pulse magnetic field ( PEMF ) 14,15 direct carpal tunnel region significantly reduce NP . Since new , novel device become commercially available produce combination static time-varying magnetic field simultaneously , hypothesize energy could direct wrist potentially influence NP score , also modulate neuronal distal latency ( neurotransmission ) . DEVICE : DESCRIPTION : ( FIGURE 1 ) This patented device ( Biaxial Super Mini [ Mx2R ] Nikken , Inc. ) measure 2 '' diameter 1 '' height wear Velcro strap similar wristwatch . It noiseless nonthermal . Its main component spherical permanent magnet , 1150G , 3/8 '' diameter rotate two perpendicular direction simultaneously produce biaxial magnetic rotation ( MX2R ) oscillate polarity 1,200 rpm-20 time per second . It drive 2 V DC micro-motor shield one inch away produce negligible back EMF . The device power three Â¼ AAA rechargeable NiMH ( Nickel Metal Hydride ) batteries Randomized double blind placebo-controlled device primary parameter pain sleep interupption score , NPS scale secondary parameter neurological exam change , nerve conduction latency median nerve , dynamometry , finger gauge pressure , CPT PGIC compare baseline end two month . Patients give free `` active '' device gratis end study .</detailed_description>
