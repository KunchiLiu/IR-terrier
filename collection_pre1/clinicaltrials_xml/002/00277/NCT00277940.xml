	<brief_summary>Abnormalities aorta identify patient undergone repair coarctation aorta various surgical technique . These abnormality think contribute ventricular hypertrophy , hypertension exercise intolerance . Aortic arch reconstruction perform variety lesion besides simple coarctation aorta ; include hypoplastic left heart syndrome variant . In latter group patient extensive reconstruction perform usually pulmonary homograft . We previously show neo-aortic dimension geometry abnormal . The elastic property neo-aorta , however , previously describe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aortic Arch Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In present study propose examine neo-aortic property cohort child single ventricle heart defect undergone bi-directional Glenn procedure ( without Norwood palliation ) compare cohort patient single ventricle aortic arch intervention . Patients group typically undergo Fontan operation 18-48 month age . After arrival operate suite placement routine instrumentation , transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) routinely obtain . All data need protocol obtain TEE . The stiffness aorta determine calculate pressure-strain elastic modulus ( Ep ) stiffness index beta ( β ) . They calculate formula Ep= [ Ps-Pd ] / [ Ds-Dd/Dd ] β = [ ln Ps/Pd [ Ds-Dd ] . Pressure-strain elastic modulus measurement utilized measure stiffness aorta carotid artery adults child high reproducibility low interobserver variability . The stiffness index beta propose well measure aortic stiffness independence measure blood pressure . The ability vessel distend store extra volume due pressure effect know compliance . A vessel high compliance `` stretchy '' therefore favorable hold great volume blood rather store lot pressure energy . Conversely , vessel low compliance less `` stretchy '' therefore favorable store lot pressure energy rather hold great volume blood . Essentially , two vessel equal size ( cross-sectional flow area volume ) , one vessel low compliance , 1 milliliter change volume low compliance ( less stretchy ) vessel result great pressure increase 1 milliliter change volume high compliance ( stretchy ) vessel . Compliance assess use automatic border detection . This provide continuous measure vessel cross-sectional area time . Compliance calculate ( Areamax-Areamean/mean blood pressure ) . Blood pressure data record simultaneously arterial catheter use routinely operation .</detailed_description>
