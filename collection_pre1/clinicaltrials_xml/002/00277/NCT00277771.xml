	<brief_summary>We propose conduct randomize study standard behavioral weight-loss treatment test use electronic diary without tailor feedback improve adherence self-monitoring subsequently improve weight loss . Subjects randomly assign different method self-monitor food exercise habit : ( 1 ) use traditional paper diary , ( 2 ) use personal digital assistant ( PDA ) , ( 3 ) use personal digital assistant also provide daily feedback .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity , major chronic health problem independent risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , continue increase alarm rate . Although weight control research significantly improve short-term treatment success , long-term weight loss maintenance lag behind . Research demonstrate consistent relationship self-monitoring eating physical activity habit success weight loss well maintenance weight loss . However , method primarily use self-monitoring continue paper diary ( PD ) , time consume burdensome . Moreover , PDs permit immediate external feedback support motivate individual . Emerging technology could improve self-monitoring weight loss treatment . However , use technological advance , personal digital assistant ( PDA ) , study weight loss treatment . The primary aim behavioral weight loss treatment study determine self-monitoring daily eat physical activity habit use PDA , without tailor feedback intervention , superior use PD term promote maintain short- long-term weight loss . Secondary aim include compare effect treatment group assignment adherence self-monitoring risk factor CHD ( lipid , glucose , insulin , C-reactive protein ) . We propose enroll 198 subject randomize one three treatment group use different method self-monitor eating physical activity habit : ( 1 ) use traditional PD delay write feedback , ( 2 ) use PDA limit feedback daily target , ( 3 ) use PDA limit feedback daily target plus receive daily , subject-tailored feedback message via PDA . The propose study include prolong ( 24 month ) supervision self-management three important component : self-monitoring , feedback , ongoing contact . Subjects complete assessment baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . This innovative study provide information efficacy combine technological advance proven behavioral strategy .</detailed_description>
