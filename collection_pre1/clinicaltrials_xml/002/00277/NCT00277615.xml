	<brief_title>Evaluation Study Ultrasound Bladder Scanner Monitoring Bladder Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A continuous precise monitor bladder volume great impotence many nephro-urological disease child . Some child suffer bladder dysfunction necessitate bladder empty catheterization . The bladder catheterization present perform fixed time interval base amount urine bladder . In order avoid overfill bladder , interval empty set safety margin . This lead least needless catheterization hereby discomfort child . A portable bladder monitor could possible give measurement degreed bladder fill hereby minimize number catheterization need . Another group child suffers daytime urinary incontinence result overactive bladder syndrome . Home recording fluid intake micturations use diagnose cause decease however ; portable bladder monitor system would possibly give true reflection bladder function . With prevalence 10 % nocturnal enuresis common nephro-urological disorder childhood . In group child portable bladder monitor may enable precise measure bladder function . In addition monitor may use alarm device treatment disorder . The portable ultrasound bladder scanner test design particularly child . Hypothesis : - The bladder volume estimate portable ultrasound bladder scanner concordant `` true '' bladder volume measure catheterization child . - The portable ultrasound bladder scanner use continuous non-invasive monitoring bladder volume natural fill child bladder dysfunction . 30 child suffer bladder dysfunction perform bladder empty catheterization recruit Center Child Incontinence , Skejby University Hospital , Aarhus , Denmark .</detailed_description>
