	<brief_summary>This study conduct test ability accuracy new instrument diagnosis periodontitis ( gum disease ) use fluid mouth . The diagnosis instrument test two type fluid , gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) saliva . GCF fluid accumulate teeth gum tissue . The fluid collect three way : 1 . Direct GCF sample 2 . GCF rinse sample 3 . Whole saliva . A total 100 adult patient participate study . These subject two patient population : 1 ) diseased population , active gum disease ; 2 ) low-risk disease population , active gum disease . Patients see 6 time course study period approximately 12 month . At visit patient undergo oral fluid collection , previously describe , thorough examination mouth , include take measurement study purpose . Patients also radiographs take baseline , month 6 , end study visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrated Microfluidic System Oral Diagnostics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ultimate goal investigation validate ability prototype platform ( miniaturize microfluidic device rapidly ( within 15 minute ) measure small volume oral fluid ( order nanoliters fluid ) identify biomarkers disease mediator inflammation ( interleukins -1 -6 ; C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , marker bone resorption ( ICTP ) . This analysis aid diagnosis active periodontal ( gum ) disease well diseases involve systemic inflammation ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease ) systemic bone loss ( osteoporosis ) . This project two specific goal : 1 . To validate ability diagnostic measure designate mediator oral fluid ; 2 . Determine ability multiplexed format mediator analysis predict disease activity ( future bone loss ) patient high low risk disease . This propose feasibility study aid provide impetus sample size design requirement large , expand human clinical trial test subsequent technology transfer .</detailed_description>
