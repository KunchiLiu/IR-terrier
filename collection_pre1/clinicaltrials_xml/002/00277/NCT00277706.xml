	<brief_summary>Parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) potent bone-building action approve treatment osteoporosis FORTEO Eli Lilly &amp; Co . Numerous study verify effectiveness increase bone mass potential PTH positively impact oral bone . The hypothesis study patient administer FORTEO along periodontal ( gum ) surgery respond favorably patient receive placebo . There 40 subject enrol study . All subject receive surgical treatment . 20 subject receive FORTEO 20 receive placebo . Subjects assign study group randomly . Neither subject clinician know whether subject receive FORTEO placebo . Patients undergo routine periodontal treatment procedure include periodontal surgery . Starting 3 day prior surgery , subject self-administer FORTEO placebo 6 week . Subjects train self-administration , procedure similar diabetic injection . Patients also take Vitamin D Calcium mouth time . Study outcomes measure blood collection ; oral fluid sampling ; oral x-ray spine hip bone density scan ; routine periodontal examination ; oral health quality life questionnaire . Patients gender ethnicity age 30-75 year include study . All ethnicity eligible entry study . No vulnerable population include . Pregnant/breast-feeding woman woman childbearing potential contraception exclude study . Research record linkable research subject . Subjects randomly assign treatment arm identify initial number . Informed consent form use obtain consent participation study subject prior enrollment . The Principal Investigator Co-Investigator explain detail study involvement give subject ample opportunity ask question . It anticipate patient FORTEO great regeneration periodontal therapy compare control patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Parathyroid Hormone ( PTH ) Osseous Cavity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parathyroid hormone endogenous hormone potent anabolic catabolic action bone . It recently approve treatment osteoporosis market FORTEO Eli Lilly Company . Numerous study human validate use increase bone mineral density prevent fracture . Interest also surface potential application treatment non-osteoporotic fracture several animal study support local application . Little known regard use treat condition oral cavity , animal study suggest bone oral cavity responsive anabolic action PTH . Furthermore , recent study indicate canine model , PTH effective reversing periodontal bone loss . Studies laboratory indicate patient hyperparathyroidism ( HPT ) increase periodontal disease measure attachment level . In fact , patient population increase osseous activity patient HPT form torus exostosis ( bony protuberances oral cavity ) . This suggest increase circulating level PTH adversely impact oral cavity . Furthermore , wind heal animal model bone regeneration , find regenerate intramembranous bone responsive anabolic action PTH endogenous bone vertebra . These study highlight potential PTH positively impact osseous heal oral cavity response periodontal therapy . The study double blind , patient randomize one two treatment group ( FORTEO placebo once/daily ) . Patients self-administer drug QD schedule , take Vitamin D Calcium , PO , QD , six week . Drug administration begin three day prior periodontal surgery . Subjects follow post-op , week 3 , week 6 , month 3 , month 6 , month 9 , month 12 visit . Clinical effect measure serum collection , gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) sampling , standard dental radiograph , oral exam include perio probing , oral health quality life questionnaire , DEXA scan .</detailed_description>
