	<detailed_description>Adverse drug event ( ADEs ) among common serious medication use concern among old patient primary care practice , yet often preventable . This translational research practice ( TRIP ) pilot study use randomize trial evaluate effect site-level intervention sample practice medically underserved community within Upstate New York Practice Based Research Network ( UNYNET ) . These site locate rural urban area include over-sample minority patient . The specific aim study : 1 . Examine feasibility objectively assess impact CRM ( adapt Crew Resource Management approach proven successful aviation well inpatient medical setting ) intervention reduce medication error among geriatric patient primary care setting ; 2 . Assess office staff internalization application CRM principles reduce geriatric medication error primary care setting examine change safety attitude construct achieve 1. practice enhancement assistant ( PEA ) 2. without PEA . Outcomes measured Aim # 1 change number , severity , consequence , stage process preventable ADEs . Outcomes Aim # 2 change safety climate , teamwork climate , stress recognition , work condition . Fifteen sit randomize one three intervention arm : usual care , CRM , CRM plus PEA . A random sample chart old adult ( age &gt; 64 ) cardiovascular disease review adverse drug event prior-year period baseline post-intervention endpoint . Participatory research method use assess provider- staff-identified barrier implementation . This study test feasibility incorporate PEA 's practice set improve geriatric medication safety . The information gather serve basis ongoing translational research program lead RO1 application .</detailed_description>
