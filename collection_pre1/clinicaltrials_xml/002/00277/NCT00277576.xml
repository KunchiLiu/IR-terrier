	<brief_title>Safety Study HBV DNA Vaccine Treat Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) responsible common form parenterally transmitted viral hepatitis . It estimate approximately 350 million people worldwide persistent carrier virus major cause acute chronic infection liver , significant associate morbidity mortality . Chronic infection occur 98 % new-born child infect vertical transmission mother 5 % individual infect 2 year age . About 25 % subject progress cirrhosis 20 % subgroup develop hepatocellular carcinoma - one common cancer world wide . HBV non-cytopathic virus liver injury mainly mediate host immune response virus-infected liver cell production inflammatory cytokine . A vigorous , polyclonal multispecific cytotoxic helper T cell response HBV readily detectable peripheral blood subject acute self-limited hepatitis B , weak , antigenically restrict ( mono- oligospecific ) undetectable subject chronic infection . A vigorous T cell response thus believe responsible elimination hepatitis B virus . The aim therapeutic vaccine would enhance natural response boost appropriate cellular immune response HBV . The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability profile pPDPSC18 DNA vaccine administer Particle Mediated Epidermal Delivery ( PMED )</detailed_description>
