	<brief_title>Histamine Pharmacogenetics Children With Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) common condition pediatric population , affect estimate 15 % child great 18 month age United States . It recognize AD disease significant heterogeneity respect disease severity response conventional pharmacologic therapy . With recognition variability come understanding , many allergic disease , exist many specific disease phenotypes ultimately govern response pharmacologic intervention . The characterization unique phenotype associate biologic mediator therefore critical therapeutic importance development disease patient-specific treatment strategy . The long term objective research explore effect genetic , environmental developmental influence primary determinant histamine action atopic child identify potential histamine `` haplotype '' may predictive disease severity , progression and/or response therapy . The primary hypothesis presence HNMT T314 allele /or slow acetylation genotype associate childhood atopic dermatitis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Caucasian , Hispanic African American child age 6 month 5 year diagnosis atopic dermatitis within last 12 month constitute candidate pool enrollment study group . The diagnosis atopic dermatitis determine presence least 3 major diagnostic feature ( i.e. , pruritis , rash , relapsingremitting presentation , family history atopy ) addition least 3 minor feature ( include limit xerosis , elevate serum IgE , ocular involvement , food allergy ) . Healthy Caucasian , Hispanic African American child within age range comprise pool enrollment control group . Any child atopic dermatitis document history asthma bronchospasm currently receive treatment either condition exclude . Any control subject asthma positive family history allergy atopic disease firstdegree relative ( biological mother , father sibling ) also ineligible enrollment .</criteria>
