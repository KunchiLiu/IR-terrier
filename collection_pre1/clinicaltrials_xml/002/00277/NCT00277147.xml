	<brief_summary>This study evaluate new ( conjugate ) vaccine typhoid fever , remain serious disease especially difficult treat develop country . Salmonella typhi , bacteria cause typhoid fever , become resistant several antibiotic increase difficulty treat disease . The disease may serious complication effect bone , brain , intestine , permanent injury death . Methods control typhoid fever , sanitary water food supply , along effective sewage treatment , likely available soon country . NIH scientist develop vaccine call Vi , make polysaccharide ( chain link sugar ) surface Salmonella typhi , bacteria cause typhoid fever . It approve World Health Organization license 94 country . It effective adult young child . Clinical trial show chemically bind Vi protein form `` conjugate vaccine '' improve extend efficacy child ( conjugate vaccine bacteria , notably meningitis cause bacteria use extensively successfully ) . Now NIH scientist develop another vaccine typhoid fever - use polysaccharide fruit , know pectin . The pectin chemically treat resembles Vi . The treated pectin , O-acetyl pectin , bound protein ; exoprotein A , ( rEPA ) . The result conjugate , form Vi . Similarly Vi conjugate induces antibody Salmonella typhi laboratory animal . If O-acetyl pectin conjugate prove successful , evaluated child age 5 14 year old infant , toward use routine vaccine infant . Volunteers age 18 45 allergy fruit pectin vaccinate typhoid fever within last 5 year may eligible study . Volunteers undergo several test first visit clinic study . A blood sample ( 2/3 ounce ) take test HIV , hepatitis B C , complete blood count , liver function , blood chemistry pregnancy woman childbearing age . The blood sample also test antibody Vi , rEPA ( protein conjugate ) , pectin . There also urine collection test . If laboratory test acceptable , volunteer ask return clinic ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Typhoid fever remain common , serious increasingly difficult treat disease develop country . Control measure , safe drinking water , food , effective sewage , likely available soon many country . In early 1990 's Salmonella typhi Mekong Delta region resistant chloramphenicol ampicillin treatment require new antibiotic ciprofloxacin . Now , resistance S. typhi spread ciprofloxacin . There three license vaccine typhoid fever . The whole cell parenteral oral attenuate vaccine confer incomplete immunity limit duration incorporate routine vaccination infant . S. typhi capsular polysaccharide ( Vi ) safe , easily standardize one injection confers 70 % immunity individual great 5 year age least 3 year . Its immunogenicity less 2-4 year-olds elicit protective antibody level child less 2 years-old . Vi elicit booster response age ( age-related T-cell independent antibody response ) . The immunogenicity Vi improve covalently bind protein form conjugate . Vi conjugate safe immunogenic Vi adult , 5-14 year-olds child 2-4 year-olds , show 90 % efficacy 2-5 year old 47 month . O-acetyl pectin mimic antigenic property Vi . Although immunogenic alone , O-acetyl pectin conjugate induces serum Vi antibody booster response mice guinea pig albeit slightly low level Vi conjugate mouse . Double immunodiffusion mouse anti-Vi reveal antigenic identity O-acetyl pectin Vi conjugate . There advantage use pectin polysaccharide component conjugate vaccine typhoid . Pectin abundant , LPS require simple chemical modification prepare di-O-acetyl derivative . Our yield O-acetyl pectin-rEPA similar Vi-rEPA . Because may reliable extrapolate data animal human especially infant , propose clinical evaluation O-acetyl pectin bound recombinant protein A Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( rEPA ) .</detailed_description>
