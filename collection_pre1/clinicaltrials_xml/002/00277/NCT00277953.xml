	<brief_summary>To date , publish report normal variation tracheal dimension pediatric patient undergo MRIs . While report normal CT study , report dimension average area lengths entire length trachea normal variation dimension various site trachea . Moreover , CT measurement likely entirely applicable MRI measurement . Since cardiac MRI become procedure choice document presence vascular ring well significance ring find , need normal value generate . This would turn permit physician determine case document vascular ring severity tracheal stenosis/deformity find .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To date , publish report normal variation tracheal dimension pediatric patient undergo MRIs . While report normal CT study , report dimension average area lengths entire length trachea normal variation dimension various site trachea . Moreover , CT measurement likely entirely applicable MRI measurement . Since cardiac MRI become procedure choice document presence vascular ring well significance ring find , need normal value generate . This would turn permit physician determine case document vascular ring severity tracheal stenosis/deformity find . Hypothesis : Patients refer cardiac MRIs evaluate vascular ring significantly small tracheal dimension ( area , long width , short width ) base percentage maximal tracheal dimension comparison patient refer cardiac MRIs indication . I would propose retrospectively review cardiac MRIs tracheal dimension 25 consecutive patient refer possible vascular ring 50 consecutive patient undergoing cardiac MRIs indication . As part study I would also propose review clinical finding prompt cardiac MRI order ( i.e . respiratory symptom , abnormal echocardiogram , abnormal CXR barium swallow ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>25 consecutive patient refer possible vascular ring 50 consecutive patient undergoing cardiac MRIs indication adequate axial doubleinversion recovery image sufficient quality permit accurate measurement variation tracheal dimension . Those meet inclusion criterion</criteria>
