	<brief_summary>Low back pain common condition , extol large cost society lose wage The Biowave System develop Biowave Corporation ( Biowave ) , Norwalk , CT. Two wire emanate unit . The feed wire attach large disposable input pad ( `` Feed Electrode '' ) . The return wire attach small pad ( `` Return Electrode '' ) source pain ( treatment site ) . The device send premixed modulate envelope two high frequency electronic wave form ( `` Feed Signal '' ) two electrode . The beat frequency modulate envelope ( `` d-Frequency '' ) equal difference frequency two feed signal . The location beat frequency formation dependent size location two electrode . With configuration use study , beat frequency signal believe form immediately ventrally Return electrode . The size volume tissue affect change dependent upon electrode geometry amplitude Feed Signal . The beat frequency low frequency block signal believe cause demodulation nerve cell reduction sodium/potassium ion exchange . As result , charge polarity nerve cell wall prevent change therefore unable transmit pain impulse . The size volume tissue affect change dependent upon electrode geometry amplitude Feed Signal . The objective study compare Biowave System TENS ( currently available treatment ) evaluate efficacy relief pain patient chronic low back pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Targeted Electronic Pain Control Device ( `` Biowave System '' ) Versus Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) Symptomatic Treatment Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background-Low back pain common , costly &amp; often chronic condition , estimate affect 85 % people lifetime . A form electronic pain control currently use TENS . Although exact mechanism completely understood , propose effectiveness base gate control theory . Biowave develop new patentable technology &amp; related device field electromedicine . The device delivers precise electrical signal specific volume tissue body , block transmission pain impulse . Treatment Plan-Treatment initiated device indicate order pt . randomize . Pts . connect one two device hidden view application two small round two-inch diameter electrode low back . Baseline-A complete medical history &amp; physical examination perform . The pt . complete BPI questionnaire &amp; randomize one two treatment order : 1 ) Biowave device follow TENS device 2 ) TENS device follow Biowave Device . 2 treatment session separate least 72 hour . Treatment-Prior treatment session , pt . complete initial VAS evaluation . Pt . 's ROM assess &amp; vital sign obtain . Pts . complete VAS &amp; categorical pain assessment end 20 minute treatment period . Post-treatment-Pts . repeat ROM test device turn &amp; electrode remove . VAS pain evaluation complete pt . 30 &amp; 60 minute , vital sign &amp; patient global impression change obtain 60 minute follow discontinuation therapy . Pts . give VAS &amp; categorical pain assessment complete 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 48 hour &amp; 1 week treatment ( return mail/fax ) ass possible long-term analgesic effect .</detailed_description>
