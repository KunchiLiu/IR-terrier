	<brief_summary>This study collect blood sample use laboratory study malaria . The World Health Organization report 40 percent world 's population risk malaria , mostly poor country . It serious disease cause parasite . Each year , 300-500 million infection lead million death . However , trait red blood cell ( erythrocyte ) protect people malaria . In study , polymorphism refers various kind red blood cell trait . The sickle cell trait example one seem offer natural survival advantage child malaria common . Researchers Laboratory Malaria Vector Research investigate way blood cell trait offer protection , new knowledge gain bring medical advance . Of particular importance study malaria organism , Plasmodium , survive inside different red blood cell . A steady , consistent , reliable supply fresh whole blood necessary testing . Patients 18 65 , weigh 110 lb . anemia know HIV , Hepatitis C , Hepatitis B may eligible study . Patients undergo medical history general assessment include vital sign temperature , heart rate , blood pressure . Blood collect vein arm , rarely vein hand . A complete blood count , CBC , do ensure blood level sufficient blood donation safe patient . Patients need enough hemoglobin , part red blood cell transport oxygen throughout body . The blood also test confirm type red blood cell traits patient . About 1 8 tablespoon may collect , blood sample small , , 1 4 teaspoon . After patient ' first visit , session take 5-20 minute . Blood collection total 2 cup donor 6-week period . Although frequency blood donation know time , unlikely patient ask donate blood four time year . It may important patient undergo repeat CBC test blood chemistry result need research . Risks associate blood collection consider minimal . They include discomfort , occasional bruising bleeding puncture site , faintness . In study , possible small amount blood may store future research , help researcher learn malaria . There plan result various research laboratory test make available patient private doctor . However , patient study may discuss result routine medical test study investigator . Some blood collect tested genetic condition . Through genetic testing , researcher learn health illness may pass people parent , people child . All result test remain confidential . Blood sample label code , reference patient ' identity protect . Participants receive $ 50 blood donation . This study direct benefit participant . Future research use blood sample help researcher learn malaria well prevent treat disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol design provide mechanism investigator Laboratory Malaria Vector Research ( LMVR ) collect process peripheral blood sample volunteer donor . Donors meet standard eligibility criterion recruit donate blood via standard phlebotomy technique NIH Clinical Center . The LMVR ongoing vitro study characterize effect hemoglobin mutation erythrocyte polymorphisms pathogenesis Plasmodium falciparum , agent deadly malaria human . G6PD deficiency , hemoglobinopathy HbS , HbC , HbE , thalassemia think evolve protective trait malaria endemic area world . However , mechanisms mutation exert protective influence largely unknown . Culturing P. falciparum erythrocytes carry protective trait allow researcher LMVR characterize cellular molecular base protection use vitro method growth analyse electron microscopy . To effect , patient know suspected erythrocyte variant recruit addition normal control . Signed informed consent obtain authorized investigator . The nature study well risk benefit donation process explain participant . Donors compensate blood donation unsuccessful attempt venipuncture . Samples use solely vitro research . To ensure confidentiality , blood assign unique code ; investigator list protocol serve custodian code link sample donor ' identity .</detailed_description>
