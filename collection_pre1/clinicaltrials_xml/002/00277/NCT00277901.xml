	<brief_summary>At Children 's Healthcare Atlanta Egleston , standard care cardiac MRI patient diagnosis Tetralogy Fallot Aortic Coarctation evaluate heart function . We propose retrospective chart review patient data along MRI data analyze ventricular function cavity volumes pre-Tetralogy Fallot repair , post-Tetralogy Fallot repair ( pre-valve repair/replacement ) post-valve repair/replacement order ass efficacy optimal timing valve replacement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Assessment RV Function : Patients With TOF Aortic Coarctation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Tetralogy Fallot various degree level right ventricular outflow tract obstruction . They undergo surgical removal obstruct structure , include pulmonary valve . The repair outflow tract do utilizing transannular patch . This approach , consider standard care , result free pulmonary insufficiency , may become severe lead right heart overload subsequent dilatation dysfunction . This chronic overloading result progressive tricuspid insufficiency suspect decline effective pulmonary blood flow , cardiac output right ventricle functional capability . Many patient develop progressive exercise intolerance , arrhythmias severe cardiomegaly lead dilate cardiomyopathy . The progressive decline patient clinical status result recommendation pulmonary valve replacement interrupt dysfunction ventricle . Clinical improvement generally see among patient cardiac function measurably improve many case , however time surgery remain undefined impact function improvement recovery post -valve replacement serious debate continuous discussion . Preliminary work suggest Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) determine right leave ventricular volume ratio 's great 2:1 associate tricuspid regurgitation , right ventricular regurgitant volume great 50 % , right ventricular ejection fraction less 45 % common among patient severe right ventricular failure dysfunction . These patient need pulmonary valve replacement routinely refer surgical intervention . Patients Aortic Coarctation localize malformation characterize deformity aortic medium , cause narrowing , usually severe , lumen vessel . Surgical repair removal malformation treatment choice however ; use MRI well determine extent damage malformation would allow surgeon plan operative strategy prior open chest .</detailed_description>
