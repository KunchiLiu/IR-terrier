	<detailed_description>TREATMENT PLAN ( 25-28 ) Patients admit GCRC 25 hour . Admission prior daily DLPC-9NC administration Upon admission , patient ask empty bladder . Urine collect 24 hour , refrigerate . Upon completion collection , urine mixed , 20 ml aliquot freeze preserve analysis . A catheter place peripheral vein , peripheral artery , appropriately heparinized . Venous arterial blood sample ( 7 ml per sample ) draw heparinized green top prior DLPC-9NC administration , follow time point : 2 , 5 , 8 , 12 , 24 hour . An additional 2 sample may draw PI discretion . ( Total blood drawn : 84 ml + 14 ml ) During GCRG hospitalization , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) do accord standard practice per patient . Patients divide cohort 6 ( 3 female 3 male ) . Each cohort undergo BAL specific time point : within 30 minute end DLPC-9NC treatment , 3 hour , 8 hour , 24 hour . In respond patient may become surgical candidate curative resection , one DLPC-9NC treatment administer prior surgery ( within 5 hour ) . Surgery proceed per standard care patient sign regular surgical consent surgical procedure . Along tumor removal , one sample venous blood arterial blood drawn comparison ( total volume : 14 ml ) . Once tumor specimen remove , piece keep liquid nitrogen , along piece normal lung tissue , analysis . Patients need sign attached consent form authorize collection specimen .</detailed_description>
