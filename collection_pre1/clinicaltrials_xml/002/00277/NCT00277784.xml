	<brief_summary>The macula site central vision within retina . The retina oxygenate underlying choroid . These tissue le 1 mm thick total . While optical technique reveal much structure retina , ultrasound allow image choroid deeper tissue . This study investigate use high frequency ( 20 MHz ) ultrasound image retina choroid patient age-related macular degeneration , prime cause blindness . The investigation involve use novel post-processing methodology achieve maximum resolution fine tissue structure involve disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , condition affect 40 % individual 70 year age , cause progressive loss central vision . Photocoagulation long use slow progress AMD , new vision-preserving method currently investigation . Because destroyed photoreceptors permanently lose , early management essential preservation vision . The aim project study AMD use suite new high-resolution ultrasound image technique develop . Specifically , high-resolution ultrasound use generate image retina choroid , include perfusion measurement use slow-flow method develop research group . Ultrasound study perform conjunction optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) image series patient age-matched control subject aim determine choroidal thickness and/or perfusion might use early indicator AMD thus aid patient management . We study 20 subject diagnose AMD . We attempt approximately equal number subject wet dry form AMD . A control group consist 20 non-AMD age-matched subject also recruit . Ultrasound scan sequence consist B-mode image macula surround tissue .</detailed_description>
