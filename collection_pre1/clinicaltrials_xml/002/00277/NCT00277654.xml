	<brief_title>Study Risperidone Monotherapy Ambulatory Bipolar Disorder With Concurrent Moderately Severe Anxiety Lifetime Panic Generalized Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods Procedures : This randomize , double-blind , placebo control , parallel-group , 3 site , 8-week trial risperidone monotherapy outpatient subject lifetime bipolar I , II , otherwise specify ( NOS ) disorder , lifetime panic generalize anxiety disorder , current , least moderately , severe anxiety symptom . Approximately 90 subject enrol obtain 60 subject complete 8-week trial . Subjects randomize risperidone placebo 1:1 ratio . No concomitant psychotropic medication allow except need ( prn ) lorazepam first two week management affective anxiety symptom , prn zolpidem zaleplon throughout study management insomnia . Throughout study , psychiatric scale use assess psychiatric symptom presence treatment-emergent adverse event monitor record . Medication Dosing : Risperidone administer initial dose 0.5 1 mg/day titrate upward dose consider optimal investigator base subject 's clinical response adverse event , exceed 2.0 mg/day end second week . Subsequently , risperidone may increase base clinical response tolerability maximum 4.0 mg/day . As need study-prescribed ( prn ) use lorazepam allow management affective anxiety symptom first two week study ; maximum 2 mg per day allow first week , maximum 1 mg per day allow second week . During second week , subject must taper lorazepam . For final six week study , lorazepam permit . Zolpidem ( 10-20 mg/day ) zaleplon ( 10-20 mg/day ) allow management insomnia , benztropine ( 0.5 - 3.0 mg/day ) allow management extrapyramidal symptom . The latter three agent permit throughout study . From week 2 , medication psychotropic effect prohibit . Screening Visit ( ) : The Screening Period last minimum 2 maximum 30 day . At first screen visit ( Visit 0 ) , informed consent obtain . The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) , Manic Module MINI plus , perform establish whether patient meet DSM-IV criterion bipolar disorder I , II , NOS , panic disorder generalize anxiety disorder . For generalized anxiety disorder , portion Criterion F - stipulate `` disturbance occur exclusively mood disorder '' suspend . The CGI-BP CGI-S perform establish severity bipolar affective symptom anxiety symptom , respectively . Subjects keep mood chart visit help follow affective anxiety symptom . The subject 's bipolar symptom must evaluate moderately severe ( defined CGI-BP &lt; 4 ) , his/her anxiety symptom must evaluate least moderately severe ( CGI-S &gt; 4 ) him/her able continue screen process enter randomize phase . Medical history review , physical exam perform , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) laboratory study ( complete metabolic profile , CBC differential platelet , urinalysis , pregnancy test , urine drug screen ) obtain . Based evaluation , determine whether subject meet entry criterion ; subject meet criterion continue screen process . Baseline Visit ( last Screening Visit ) : At baseline ( Visit 1 ) , subject whose screen evaluation continue meet inclusion/exclusion criterion may enter study randomize . These evaluation include repeat Clinical Global Impression modify bipolar illness ( CGI-BP ) Clinical Global Improvement Scale anxiety symptom ( CGI-S ) ensure subject continue moderately severe bipolar affective symptom least moderately severe anxiety symptom . Baseline rating include : Sheehan Panic Anxiety Scale-Clinician Rated ( SPAS-C ) ; Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAM-A ) ass anxiety symptom ; Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) ass manic symptom ; Inventory Depressive Symptoms ( IDS ) ( long form ) ass depressive symptom . Subjects also evaluate CGI-BP , Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS ) . The Panic-Agoraphobic Spectrum-Self-Report ( PAS-SR ) use assess lifetime presence core related feature panic disorder . ( Subjects score &gt; 35 PAS-SR classify a-priori panic spectrum symptom [ PSS ] ) . The Family Impact Scale ( FIS ) administer . The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) , Simpson Angus Scale ( SAS ) , Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) administer assess extrapyramidal symptom . Blood pressure , pulse , height , weight , measure . Study medication dispense Physician Investigator form 0.5 mg capsule . The dose range risperidone 0.5 4 mg/day . Treatment Period : Study visit occur every week eight week treatment . It expect risperidone gradually increase optimal dose first month treatment . The following procedure complete visit . 1 . Collect unused risperidone , perform study drug accountability , record dosage study drug use . A subject 's unused study medication re-dispensed back subject . 2. Review mood chart administer Clinician Global Improvement anxiety symptom -21 point scale ( CGI-I-21 ) , Patient Global Improvement anxiety symptom -21 point scale ( PGI-21 ) , SPAS-C , HAM-A , YMRS , IDS , CGI-BP , SDS rating . 3 . Assess record adverse event . 4 . Perform AIMS , SAS , BARS . 5 . Obtain blood pressure , pulse , weight . 6 . Record concomitant medication use ( mood chart ) 7 . Adjust risperidone dose ( necessary ) dispense study drug . Final Evaluation ( week 8 ) Early Termination : The following evaluation conduct completion , early withdrawal , 8-week treatment phase . All psychiatric evaluation final study procedure ( include repeat physical exam , EKG , laboratory study ) complete prior discontinuation risperidone . The evaluation perform : - Collect unused risperidone , perform study drug accountability , record dosage study drug use . - Review mood chart perform CGI-21 , SPAS-C , HAM-A , YMRS , IDS , CGI-BP , PGI-21 , SDS rating . - Repeat PAS-SR - Repeat FIS - Assess record adverse event . - Obtain blood pressure , pulse , weight , determine BMI . - Perform physical examination , AIMS , SAS , BARS . - Obtain laboratory ( complete metabolic profile , CBC with/differential platelet , urinalysis , pregnancy test , urine drug screen ) . - Repeat EKG . - Record concomitant medication use ( mood chart ) - Adjust risperidone dose ( necessary ) prescribe drug ( subject respond chooses continue risperidone ) , dispense risperidone taper discontinuation ( subject respond subject chooses discontinue risperidone reason ) .</detailed_description>
