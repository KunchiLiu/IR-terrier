	<brief_title>VNP40101M Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Locally Advanced Metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine overall response rate ( partial complete ) patient relapse refractory locally advanced metastatic small cell lung cancer treat VNP40101M . - Determine toxic effect drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease state ( sensitive relapse [ progressive disease &gt; 3 month respond first-line chemotherapy ] v resistant disease [ progressive disease ≤ 3 month first-line chemotherapy ] ) . Patients receive VNP40101M IV 15-30 minute weekly 3 week . Treatment repeat every 6 week 6 course . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course therapy CR . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 18 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 87 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
