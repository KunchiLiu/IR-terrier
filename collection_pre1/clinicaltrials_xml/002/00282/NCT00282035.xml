	<brief_summary>To determine Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation , use 3D CRT , effective Whole Breast Irradiation follow breast conserve surgery woman new histological diagnosis ductal carcinoma situ invasive breast cancer without evidence metastatic disease . Effectiveness determine rate ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence . General objective improve convenience quality life female patient receive breast irradiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAPID : Randomized Trial Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following breast conserve surgery completion chemotherapy , patient stratify accord age , tumour histology , tumour size , adjuvant hormonal therapy clinical centre . Patients allocate receive either whole breast irradiation 3D CRT accelerate partial breast irradiation . Radiation therapy administer soon possible follow heal surgical incision ( 3-4 week ) within 12 week patient treat chemotherapy . If patient treat chemotherapy , radiation therapy begin 2 week beyond 8 week last dose chemotherapy . Patients treat whole breast irradiation receive total dose 42.5 Gy 16 fraction , give daily basis , time period 22 day . Patients large breast size permit receive total dose 50 Gy 25 fraction , give daily basis , time period 35 day . Boost irradiation permit patient treated whole breast irradiation . Boost irradiation 10 Gy/4-5 fraction daily time period 4-7 day permit patient deem moderate high risk local recurrence per local cancer centre guideline . Patients treat 3D CRT accelerate partial breast irradiation receive total dose 38.5 Gy 10 fraction , deliver twice day , time period 5-8 day . Each daily dose must separate 6-8 hour . Patients follow indefinitely assess formally 6 12 month date randomization yearly basis . Patients assess acute late radiation toxicity , cardiac toxicity , recurrent disease , new primary cancer , cosmetic outcome , quality life overall survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1a . Female patient new histological diagnosis DCIS . OR 1b . Female patient new histological diagnosis invasive carcinoma breast evidence metastatic disease . 2 . Treated BCS microscopically clear resection margin invasive noninvasive disease ( residual disease excision ) . 3 . Negative axillary node involvement include micrometastasis &lt; = 0.2mm positive cell identify IHC determine either : ( ) sentinel node biopsy ( ii ) axillary node dissection ( iii ) clinical exam patient DCIS 1 . Age &lt; 40 year . 2 . A known deleterious mutation BRCA 1 and/or BRCA 2 . 3 . Tumour size &gt; 3 cm great diameter pathological examination ( include invasive noninvasive component ) . 4 . Tumour histology limit lobular carcinoma . 5 . History cancer : Patients another active malignancy malignancy treat &lt; 5 year prior randomization exclude . Patients prior diagnosis invasive noninvasive breast cancer either breast exclude regardless disease free interval . Patients concurrent invasive noninvasive contralateral breast cancer also exclude . Patients prior concurrent basal cell squamous cell skin cancer eligible trial . 6 . More one primary tumour different quadrant breast . 7 . Previous irradiation ipsilateral breast would preclude whole breast irradiation . 8 . Presence ipsilateral breast implant pacemaker . 9 . Serious nonmalignant disease ( e.g . cardiovascular , pulmonary , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , scleroderma ) would preclude definitive radiation treatment . 10 . Estrogen receptor status ( ER ) know . 11 . For patient treat adjuvant chemotherapy : unable commence radiation therapy within 12 week last surgical procedure breast . 12 . For patient treat adjuvant chemotherapy : unable commence within 8 week last dose chemotherapy . 13 . Currently pregnant lactating . 14 . Psychiatric addictive disorder would preclude obtain informed consent adherence protocol . 15 . Geographic inaccessibility followup . 16 . Inability localize surgical cavity CT ( i.e. , evidence surgical clip seroma ) . 17 . Inability adequately plan patient experimental technique .</criteria>
