	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether bar cod surgical sponge significantly increase safety operation , specifically ( 1 ) reduce discrepancy miscount , ( 2 ) reduce total staff time spend sponge counting , ( 3 ) reduce disruption operate room system . Also , study aim characterize limitation current surgical sponge count protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior work Dr. Gawande show incidence retain foreign body 1 9000 1 19000 inpatient operation , least year hospital size . Leaving foreign object body cavity surgery lead infection , bowel obstruction case , death . The current approach prevent problem base adherence count protocol check number instrument sponge begin end case . The problem retain foreign body often attribute error counting processâ€”for example case retain object , count total begin end case erroneous item initially count , item `` double- counted '' end case . In addition potential incorrect count , count protocol lead disruption case flow inefficiency . In observational study surgical performance , bring human factor expert Brigham Women 's Hospital operating room examine 10 complex case , count protocol track instrument sponge particular play surprisingly negative role team performance . After incision make , nurse devote average 35 minute count protocol . This represent 14.5 % operative time . During time , investigator able document substantial negative effect surgical work nurse involve count protocol . Furthermore , count discrepancy observe occur two-thirds case total 17 discrepancy 9 case . As result , several patient , progress still-incomplete operation substantially delay suspend nurse attempt reconcile inconsistency . Based 2 study , conduct rigorous search innovation process , generate five possible technology detect instrument sponge leave behind . Discussions engineer focus group operate room nurse identify two technology feasible adoption : ( 1 ) bar-coded sponge ; ( 2 ) computer vision system track instrument . SurgiCount Medical , subsequently join Patient Safety Technologies , Los Angeles , design Safety-sponge System , utilize bar-coded sponge available test . The 4 '' x 4 '' X-ray detectable gauze sponge 18 '' x 18 '' X-Ray detectable laparotomy pad manufacture fashion sponge currently use today . They contain X-ray detectable strip identify retain sponge plain X-ray . A unique bar code ( data matrix code ) securely affixed sponge . The datamatrix code ECC200 error correction allow accuracy 1 error 10.5 million ( bad case ) , 1 612.9 million ( best case ) . FDA 510K exemption status bar cod sponge already secure manufacturer . The bar code detector ( sponge counter ) design small handheld computer touchscreen display . Before introduce new technology healthcare system , important study effect technology system . This include whether new technology desire effect , also whether unintended negative effect . Our pre-clinical simulation suggest Safety-Sponge System potential improve safety efficiency operate room hospital move ahead purchase system . However argue benefit must prove randomized trial compare traditional counting protocol . If hypothesis correct , technology could revolutionize counting procedure improve safety efficiency operate room . This could decrease risk retain foreign body patient . In addition , could decrease workload nursing staff operate room , lead improvement work condition overall safety system . Comparisons : patient randomize one two equal group : usual counting protocol versus bar-code technology assist counting .</detailed_description>
