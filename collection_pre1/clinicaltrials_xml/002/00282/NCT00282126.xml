	<detailed_description>Over 10 million adult United States osteoporosis , another 18 million low bone mass , risk factor develop disease . Each year , approximately 1.5 million fracture associate osteoporosis . Adequate intake calcium vitamin D current nutritional approach prevent age-related bone loss . However , even sufficient level nutrient , bone loss still occur . Too much acid body , cause diet , age , protein metabolism , appear link loss calcium via urine , bone loss , muscle breakdown . Potassium citrate neutralize acid . The purpose study determine effect various dos potassium citrate bone density muscle mass old , healthy adult . This study last 6 month . Baseline measurement take place Weeks 1 4 . During time , participant first receive placebo 2-week period . Participants undergo calcium balance study , involve consumption certain study food 12 day overnight stay research unit calcium absorption test . The calcium balance study follow blood collection . At Week 5 , participant randomly assign receive either potassium citrate placebo daily . For first 9 week treatment , weekly blood collection periodic urine collection participant . At Month 6 , blood urine collect , participant complete questionnaire diet physical activity , second calcium balance study .</detailed_description>
