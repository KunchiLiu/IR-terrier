	<brief_summary>This National Institute Health ( NIH ) fund , investigator-initiated , single center prospective study investigate ability new dual-modality positron emission tomography compute tomography ( PET-CT ) image system comparison conventional image method assess treatment response men metastatic prostate cancer . The investigator enroll two group men stage IV metastatic prostate cancer , group comprise 160 patient . - Group I : men newly diagnose hormone-responsive measurable metastatic disease treat androgen-ablation therapy - Group II : men newly-developed hormone-refractory measurable metastatic disease treat chemotherapy /or therapy hormone refractory disease To eligible , men either group must rise serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level - define least 2 consecutive rise PSA document reference value ( 1st measure within 28 day prior recruitment ) . The first rise PSA ( 2nd measure ) take least 14 day reference value . A confirmatory PSA measure ( 3rd measure ) obtain least 14 day 2nd measure require must great 2nd measure . Additionally , patient must serum PSA concentration least 2 ng/mL addition increase PSA eligible . Patients follow PET-CT 4 , 8 , 12 month initiation androgen ablation therapy ( Group I ) chemotherapy ( Group II ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our long-range objective obtain pilot data investigate ability new dual-modality positron emission tomography compute tomography ( PET-CT ) image system assess treatment response patient metastatic prostate cancer comparison conventional imaging . PET-CT employed staging ; men study stage IV metastatic prostate cancer . We believe combine anatomic in-vivo metabolic image information provide PET-CT allows accurate objective assessment critical clinical issue early prediction evaluation response resistance various therapeutic intervention , include novel chemotherapy regimen , well prediction key clinical outcome time hormone-refractoriness survival . Our intermediate-range objective therefore investigate diagnostic prognostic utility PET-CT commonly available PET tracer , [ F-18 ] -fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) , metastatic prostate cancer . We plan correlate treatment-induced change glucose metabolism metastatic prostate cancer lesion change various conventional clinical , laboratory , diagnostic imaging parameter serum prostate-specific antigen level , lesion size , time androgen independence , survival . This objective motivate preliminary basic science clinical data well publish report investigator demonstrate pragmatic potential diagnostic prognostic utility FDG PET-CT men metastatic prostate cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>GroupI ( hormoneresponsive ) inclusion criterion : Age &gt; 21 year , men ethnic background Patient must histological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate currently must metastatic disease ( stage TxNxM1 ) hormone naïve receive prior development objective evidence MACRO metastatic recurrent disease ( e.g . biochemical PSA relapse without image evidence disease ) . Evidence metastatic disease must document : conventional image evidence metastatic disease determine CT , bone scintigraphy , ( Note : although strict window obtain scan bone , CT ) relative time PET scan , every effort make 'standard ' scan obtain within 3 month Baseline PET scan GroupII ( hormonerefractory ) inclusion criterion : Age &gt; 21 year , men ethnic background Patients must receive prior hormonal therapy . Patients treat orchiectomy eligible . Patient must histological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate currently must metastatic disease ( stage TxNxM1 ) unresponsive refractory hormonal therapy . Evidence unresponsive refractory disease must document either : 1. progression disease assess CT bone scan judge clinically base factor increase bone pain ( Note : although strict window obtain scan ( bone , CT ) relative time PET scan , every effort make 'standard ' scan obtain within 3 month PET scan ) OR 2. rise serum PSA level define least 2 consecutive rise PSA document reference value ( 1st measure within 3 month prior recruitment ) ; The first rise PSA ( 2nd measure ) take least 14 day reference value . A confirmatory PSA measure ( 3rd measure ) obtain least 14 day 2nd measure must great 2nd measure . Additionally , patient must serum PSA concentration least 2 ng/mL addition increase PSA eligible . However , patient clinically judge progressive disease irrespective PSA ( e.g . metastasisrelated bone pain , clear increase lesion evident bone scan and/or CT available ) , document minimum rise PSA level would require . Other general inclusion criterion group : If treat physician determine patient clinically respond current therapy prescribed , best interest patient , physician plan change treatment new treatment . 1 . Example : Group I patient currently treat form antiandrogen therapy respond ; patient consider enrollment PETCT imaging study prior new antiandrogen therapy even though treat antiandrogen therapy . The wait time end old therapy begin new therapy base entirely clinical judgment 2 . Example : Group II patient currently treat form therapy hormone refractory disease ( chemo ) therapy respond ; patient consider enrollment PETCT imaging study prior new therapy even though treat chemotherapy another type hormonerefractive therapy . The wait time end old therapy begin new therapy base entirely clinical judgment May receive prior surgery ( 14 day must elapse since completion surgery recovery side effect ) Creatinine ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( within 28 day prior enrollment ) Men childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception . Must competent consent study requirement Patients may also enrol study either group therapeutic regimen ( hormone therapy chemotherapy and/or therapy hormone refractory disease administer 2 week prior baseline PET scan . OPTIONAL : Completed analgesic pain survey . If unable complete questionnaire English Spanish , patient still participate study . History cancer prostate cancer ( except squamous cell carcinoma skin treat curative intent ) cancer clinically judge cure inactive base history , physical examination , tumor marker , image finding . Active infection ( except mild upper respiratory infection sit clinically judge interfere image interpretation per case basis ) History poorlycontrolled diabetes mellitus ( Fasting Blood Glucose great 200 mg/dL ) order avoid false negative result due glucose competition [ F18 ] Fluorodeoxyglucose cellular uptake Active inflammatory condition ( e.g . rheumatoid arthritis , sarcoid ) History complicate nonhealing fracture Not competent consent</criteria>
