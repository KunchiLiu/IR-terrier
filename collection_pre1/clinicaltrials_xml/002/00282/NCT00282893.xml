	<brief_title>Balloon Prophylaxis Aneurysmal Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) afflict 30,000 patient year United States . Fifteen percent survive initial bleeding die suffer disability delay ischemic deficit ( stroke ) due vasospasm . Vasospasm condition artery brain constrict , allow sufficient blood flow oxygenation . Research pharmacological prevention treatment vasospasm result minimal improvement problem . Transluminal ballooning procedure open blood vessel , allow blood flow oxygen get brain easily . Researchers believe dilation blood vessel last least 7 day . This procedure use treat severe vasospasm although commonly use prevent vasospasm . The purpose trial find procedure , perform immediately aneurysm secure , prevents spasm brain improves patient outcome . Eligible SAH patient whose aneurysm repair neurosurgical endovascular procedure enrol study randomize receive either prophylactic transluminal ballooning procedure receive standard care , include currently exist therapy treatment vasospasm . Participants ask return follow-up examination 3 6 month evaluate recovery use standardized outcome scale .</detailed_description>
