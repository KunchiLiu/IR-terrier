	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease remain leading cause morbidity mortality woman account 250,000 death per year . While mortality rate decrease significantly men last several decade , little change woman . Furthermore , despite high prevalence ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) woman , clinical trial focus male cohort , result lack data woman . Their exclusion clinical trial primarily due follow : 1 ) child- bear potential , 2 ) beyond arbitrary age limit establish trial , 3 ) frequent concomitant advance disease , 4 ) inhomogeneity within study population . Extrapolation publish clinical trial data ( predominately obtain men ) woman controversial due difference epidemiology heart disease woman . Treatment often seek later life usually accompany advanced disease co-morbidities , therefore , impact survival . In addition , woman frequently absence clinical symptom atypical presentation , make diagnosis coronary artery disease ( CAD ) challenge . Furthermore , woman may also first manifestation CAD sudden death acute myocardial infarction . Therefore , clear need early identification IHD woman treatment may employ prior advanced state disease high risk unfavorable outcome . The optimal non-invasive test evaluation IHD woman unknown . A number different modality employ include exercise ECG stress test , 2-dimensional stress echocardiography , single photon emission computerize tomography ( SPECT ) myocardial perfusion imaging , electron beam tomography . Additionally , cohort woman test perform also ill define . The recent AHA/ACC guideline suggest ECG stress test preferred approach . Supportive data recommendation controversial , many study examine diagnostic value ECG stress test largely perform small cohort woman date . These trial indicate diagnostic accuracy stress test fair ( sensitivity=32-89 % ; specificity=41-68 % ) . A recent meta-analysis 3,874 woman demonstrate modest sensitivity specificity , 62 % 69 % respectively , even adjustment referral bias ( 8 ) . Published guideline also include meta-analysis confirm low level ( sensitivity=33 % ) detection disease . Additionally , high rate false positive , well inability fully ascertain extent disease , therefore limit potential value ECG stress test . Even though exercise stress testing support recent clinical guideline , addition SPECT myocardial perfusion image independent incremental diagnostic prognostic value . Improved diagnostic accuracy also note perfusion image ability predict cardiac event woman well establish . Furthermore , recent data support cost-effectiveness strategy employ myocardial perfusion image assessment woman risk ICD . The current AHA/ACC recommendation fail take account woman often limited ability complete maximal exercise , problem likely due old age frequent co-morbidities compare men . This functional impairment may lead lack ischemia provocation and/or indeterminate exercise test result . Maximal predict heart rate , oxygen consumption , , commonly , metabolic equivalent ( METs ) measure estimate physical work capacity . The Duke Activity Status Index ( DASI ) simple 12-item questionnaire estimate peak oxygen consumption . The Duke Activity Status Index ( DASI ) questionnaire may identify patient likely perform inadequate exercise , amount nearly 40 % woman refer exercise testing . The optimal strategy evaluation woman suspect ischemic heart disease unknown quite controversial . Several algorithms suggest evaluation woman suspect CAD . A recent consensus paper American Society Nuclear Cardiology suggest strategy employ perfusion imaging , provide little evidence support clinical strategy , prospective clinical trial . The focus investigation compare different strategy assessment woman intermediate high clinical risk IHD prospective , randomized basis . This study therefore focus provide high level clinical evidence base future recommendation guideline care woman heart disease .</detailed_description>
