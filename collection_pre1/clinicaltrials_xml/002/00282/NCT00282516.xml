	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Determine whether home asthma telemonitoring use store-and-forward technology improve outcome compare in-person , office-based visit . METHODS : 120 patient 6-17 yrs persistent asthma randomize two group : office virtual . Both group follow ambulatory clinical pathway 12 month . Office patient receive traditional in-person education case management . Virtual patient receive computer , Internet connection , in-home Web-based case management receive education via study web site . They also record forwarded video peak flow inhaler use case manager two time week 6 week week thereafter submit daily asthma diary electronically via web site . Virtual patient see in-person 3 time . Regimen adherence assess monitoring therapeutic ( controller medication use , video medication use ) diagnostic ( asthma symptom diary peak flow submit electronically ) outcomes . Disease control outcome measure include quality life , utilization service , symptom control . RESULTS : 120 volunteer ( 45 female ) enrol . The group clinically comparable : office 22 female , 38 male 9.0 + 3.0 yr ( mean + SD ) virtual 23 female , 37 male , 10.2 + 3.1 yr . Virtual patient higher metered-dose inhaler/valved hold chamber score office group 52 week ( 94 % vs 89 % , p &lt; 0.05 ) , high adherence daily asthma symptom diary submission ( 35.4 % vs 20.8 % , p &lt; 0.01 ) , less participant time ( 636 vs 713 patient month , p &lt; 0.05 ) , old ( 10.2 + 3.1 year virtual , 9.0 + 3.0 office , p &lt; 0.05 ) . Caregivers group perceive increase quality life ( p &lt; 0.05 ) increase asthma knowledge score baseline ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . There outcome difference therapeutic disease control outcome measure . CONCLUSION : Virtual patient achieve excellent asthma therapeutic disease control outcomes . When compare idealize office-based care adherent diary submission well inhaler score 52 week office-based patient . Store-and-forward telemedicine technology case management provide additional tool assist management child persistent asthma .</detailed_description>
