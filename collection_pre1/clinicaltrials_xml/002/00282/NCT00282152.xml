	<brief_summary>B-STN DBS one effective surgical treatment PD patient suffer levodopa-induced motor complication . The relatively low incidence permanent adverse effect potential neuroprotection alteration natural course PD suggest highly favorable benefit-to-risk ratio procedure . Since neuroprotection best apply early disease course survive neuron , believe investigation procedure warrant . The propose pilot study provide necessary data substantiate safety tolerability procedure well provide data design full-scale , multicenter trial investigate hypothesis B-STN DBS safe effective treatment slow progression PD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Early Stage Parkinson 's Disease ( PD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot trial design specifically collect preliminary safety tolerability data necessary conduct future phase III clinical trial investigate hypothesis deep brain stimulation subthalamic nucleus subject early Parkinson 's slow progression disease . The study design prospective , randomize , blind , single-center trial compare safety tolerability B-STN DBS + ODT vs. ODT alone ( control , standard care ) 30 subject ( 15 per group ) early PD ( Hoehn Yahr stage II medication ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must clinical diagnosis probable idiopathic PD . Demonstrated response dopaminergic therapy , define demonstrate least 30 % improvement parkinsonian motor sign , base upon UPDRS motor examination subscore , follow administration DA drug ( ) screen neurological examination . Hoehn Yahr ( H &amp; Y ) stage II OFF medication . No contraindication surgery . Age 50 75 year old . Available followup four year . Informed Consent : The subject understands risk , benefit , alternative study procedure participation study . MRI within normal range age . Levodopa dopamine agonist therapy great six month less equal four year . Evidence alternative diagnosis secondary parkinsonism , suggest feature unusual early clinical course : Prominent postural instability , freeze phenomenon , hallucination unrelated medication first 3 year symptom onset ; dementia precede motor symptom ; supranuclear gaze palsy ( restriction upward gaze ) slow vertical saccade first year ; severe , symptomatic dysautonomia unrelated medication ; documentation condition know produce parkinsonism plausibly connect subject 's symptom ( suitably locate focal brain lesion neuroleptic use within past 6 month ) Uncontrolled medical condition clinically significant medical disease would increase risk develop pre postoperative complication ( e.g. , significant cardiac pulmonary disease , uncontrolled hypertension ) . Evidence dementia Major psychiatric disorder Previous brain operation injury . Active participation another clinical trial treatment PD . Patients demand cardiac pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD 's ) . Patients medical condition require repeat MRI scan diathermy treatment . Evidence exist dyskinesia motor fluctuation .</criteria>
