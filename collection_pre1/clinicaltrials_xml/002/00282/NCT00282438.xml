	<brief_summary>Sarcoidosis disease believe due immune cell , cell normally protect body , attack lung , heart , nerve , organ system within body . As result , affected organ system fail work properly cause difficulty breathing ; heart failure ; inability nerve respond properly cause numbing , tingle , pain , progressive muscle weakness ; symptom depend organ body system involve . The likelihood progression disease high . This study design examine whether treat patient high dose cyclophosphamide ( drug reduces function immune system ) ATG ( protein kill immune cell think cause disease ) , follow return previously collect blood stem cell stop progression sarcoidosis . Stem cell undeveloped cell capacity grow mature blood cell , normally circulate blood stream . The purpose high dose cyclophosphamide ATG destroy cell immune system . The purpose stem cell infusion evaluate whether treatment produce normal immune system longer attack body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Support Patients With Refractory Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Method Harvesting Stem Cells Based experience pilot study , current protocol mobilize stem cell granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) collect stem cell apheresis , subsequent bone marrow harvest perform need supplement peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) . Based experience autoimmune flare patient receive G-CSF alone mobilization , patient mobilize cyclophosphamide 2.0 g/m2 G-CSF 10 mcg/kg . Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide ( CY ) active agent patient wide variety malignancy . It use frequently therapy lymphoid malignancy potent immunosuppressive activity . It frequently use cytotoxic immunosuppressive agent patient undergoing marrow transplant treatment patient autoimmune disease . It alkylating agent require hepatic metabolism active metabolite , phosphoramide mustard acrolein . These active metabolite react nucleophilic group . It available oral intravenous preparation . Bioavailability 90 % give orally . The half-life parent compound 5.3 hour adult , half-life major metabolite phosphoramide mustard 8.5 hour . Liver renal dysfunction lead prolong serum half-life . CY administer intravenously dosage 60 mg/kg 2 successive day ( use adjust ideal body weight patient 's actual body weight great 100 % ideal body weight ) . The major dose limit side effect high dos cardiac necrosis . Hemorrhagic cystitis occur mediate acrolein metabolite . This prevent co-administration MESNA bladder irrigation . Other notable side effect include nausea , vomit , alopecia , myelosuppression SIADH . Refer institutional manual information administration , toxicity complication . Rabbit-Derived Anti-Thymocyte Globulin ( ATG ) Rabbit-derived anti-human thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) gamma globulin preparation obtain hyperimmune serum rabbit immunize human thymocytes . ATG use predominately solid organ transplant immunosuppressive regimen . ATG predominantly lymphocyte-specific immunosuppressive agent . It contain antibody specific antigen commonly find surface T cell . After bind surface molecule , ATG promote depletion T cell circulation mechanism , include opsonization complement-assisted , antibody-dependent , cell-mediated cytotoxicity . The plasma half-life range 1.5 12 day . ATG administer intravenously dose 0.5-mg/kg recipient body weight day -6 dose 1.0 mg/kg recipient body weight day -5 -1 . Unlike equine ATG , rabbit ATG require pre-infusion skin test check hypersensitivity . Methylprednisolone 250mg ( dose adjust base patient 's condition ) give every dose ATG . Additional medication diphenhydramine may give discretion attend physician . Although rare , major toxicity anaphylaxis ; chill , fever , pruritus serum sickness may occur . Fludarabine Fludarabine phosphate rapidly dephosphorylated 2-fluoro-ara-A phosphorylated intracellularly deoxycytidine kinase active triphosphate , 2-fluoro-ara-ATP . This metabolite appear act inhibit DNA polymerase alpha , ribonucleotide reductase DNA primase , thus inhibit DNA synthesis . The mechanism action antimetabolite completely characterize may multi-faceted . Phase I study human demonstrate fludarabine phosphate rapidly convert active metabolite , 2-fluoro-ara-A , within minute intravenous infusion . Consequently , clinical pharmacology study focus 2-fluoro-ara-A pharmacokinetics . After five daily dos 25 mg 2-fluoro-ara-AMP/m2 cancer patient infuse 30 minute , 2-fluoro-ara-A concentration show moderate accumulation . During 5-day treatment schedule , 2-fluoro-ara-A plasma trough level increase factor 2 . The terminal half-life 2-fluoro-ara-A estimate approximately 20 hour . In vitro , plasma protein bind fludarabine range 19 % 29 % . CAMPATH Campath-1H humanize fusion protein direct CD52 antigen express lymphocyte , monocyte macrophage . It potent immunosuppressive property effective prevention graft-versus-host disease . 30 mg/day CAMPATH give intravenously 2 hour day -4 , -3 -2 . The commonly reported adverse reaction infusion reaction fever , chill , hypotension , urticaria , nausea , rash , tachycardia , dyspnea ) , cytopenia ( neutropenia , lymphopenia , thrombocytopenia , anemia ) , infection ( CMV viremia , CMV infection , infection ) . In clinical trial , frequency infusion reaction high first week treatment . Other commonly report adverse reaction include vomit , abdominal pain , insomnia anxiety . The commonly report serious adverse reaction cytopenias , infusion reaction , immunosuppression/infections . About 30 minute patient get Campath , he/she give medication ( acetaminophen diphenhydramine , give orally , IV ) help reduce side effect .</detailed_description>
