	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Adjuvant Therapy Gefitinib ( Iressa , ZD1839 ) Patients With Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one common cancer world1 . HCC risk increase drastically patient chronic hepatitis B infection , hepatitis C infection liver cirrhosis . HCC prevalent region due endemic hepatitis B infection increase incidence hepatitis C. Patients HCC poor prognosis HCC tumor usually non-symptomatic . Most patient diagnosed disease reach advanced stage . Chemotherapy may offer palliative benefit patient advance HCC show prolong survival patient . HCC patient need innovative targeted therapy . Therefore , propose study gefitinib adjuvant therapy patient resect HCC . Gefitinib block function epidermal growth factor receptor key factor stimulate liver cancer growth . In mouse , gefitinib show reduce size liver cancer . It also anti tumor activity patient various cancer include HCC . Gefitinib relieve disease-related symptom patient . Overall , gefitinib well tolerated treatment suitable long-term use . At time diagnosis surgical evaluation , patient resectable hepatocellular carcinoma ask participate study.Patients register consent form obtain . Patient ask donate tumor tissue , urine blood samples.Tumorand normal specimen collect time surgery . After patient recovers surgery ( 4-6 week ) fullfills eligiblity , patient receive gefitinib 250 mg p.o . daily 6 month . Patient remain study till completion treatment . The following condition study doctor remove study stop therapy : 1 . Interruption treatment 4 consecutive week due side effect , resolve . 2. withdraw consent patient . ii . Your disease become bad . iii . New information gefitinib treatment harmful patient become available . Patient evaluate one month , 3 month 6 month gefitinib . After , evaluate patient least every 3 month first 2 year , every 6 month next 3 year , yearly afterwards . Draw blood store serum urine interval relapse and/or death . Conduct correlative study urine , serum tumor tissue clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
