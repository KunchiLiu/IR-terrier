	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effects Rituximab Immune Responses Subjects With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Receiving Background Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomize 2 group study : Group A ( active group ) Group B ( control group ) . Patients active rheumatic arthritis treat rituximab combination methotrexate ( Group A ) compare patient treated methotrexate alone ( Group B ) . Group A Group A patient receive rituximab 1000 mg intravenously ( IV ) Days 3 17 36 week treatment period . At Day 1 Week 24 , patient receive intradermal injection 0.1 mL C. albicans volar surface forearm . Forty-eight 72 hour injection , patient evaluate delayed-type hypersensitivity response measure diameter induration ( palpable raise , harden area forearm skin ) . At Week 24 , patient receive tetanus toxoid adsorb booster vaccine ( 1 mg 0.5 mL ) intramuscular ( IM ) injection deltoid muscle . Serum level tetanus toxoid titer obtain Day 3 immediately prior first administration rituximab , immediately prior 4 week administration tetanus toxoid adsorbed vaccine . At Week 28 , patient receive IM injection 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( 0.5 mL ) deltoid muscle . Serum level antibodies 12 pneumococcal serotypes measure Day 3 immediately prior first administration rituximab , immediately prior 4 week administration pneumococcal vaccine . At Weeks 32 33 , patient receive subcutaneous ( SC ) keyhole limpet hemocyanin 1 mg. Serum anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin antibody level measure Day 3 immediately prior first administration rituximab , immediately prior 4 week first administration keyhole limpet hemocyanin . Samples obtain determination serum rituximab concentration ( pharmacokinetics ) , peripheral blood CD19 count ( pharmacodynamics ) , presence human anti−chimeric antibody patient Group A . Group A patient complete treatment period Week 36 , qualify , option enter optional extension re-treatment period . Patients qualify choose receive optional extension re-treatment enter approximately 1-year safety follow-up period . After safety follow-up period , patient remain peripherally CD19-positive B-cell deplete entered B-cell follow-up period follow every 12 week peripheral CD19-positive B cell return baseline value low limit normal , whichever low . Group B Because immune response vaccine likely influence knowledge treatment assignment time-of-year administration , vaccination Group B patient administer sooner Group A 36 week treatment period . At Day 1 Week 12 , patient receive intradermal injection 0.1 mL C. albicans volar surface forearm . Forty-eight 72 hour injection , patient evaluate delayed-type hypersensitivity response measure diameter induration ( palpable raise , harden area forearm skin ) . On Day 1 , patient receive tetanus toxoid adsorb booster vaccine ( 1 mg 0.5 mL ) IM injection deltoid muscle . Serum level tetanus toxoid titer obtain immediately prior 4 week administration tetanus toxoid adsorbed vaccine . At Week 4 , patient receive IM injection 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( 0.5 mL ) deltoid muscle . Serum level antibodies 12 pneumococcal serotypes measure Day 1 , immediately prior 4 week administration pneumococcal vaccine . At Weeks 8 9 , patient receive SC keyhole limpet hemocyanin 1 mg. Serum anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin antibody level measure Day 1 , immediately prior 4 week first administration keyhole limpet hemocyanin . Upon completion Week 12 visit , Group B patient active rheumatic arthritis , define swollen joint count ( SJC ) ≥ 4 ( 66 joint count ) tender joint count ( TJC ) ≥ 6 ( 68 joint count ) eligible treatment 2 infusion rituximab 1000 mg IV , 14 day apart . Patients receive first infusion rituximab within 2 week complete Week 12 visit second C. albicans skin test read . Patients receive methylprednisolone 100 mg IV infusion rituximab . Group B patient receive treatment rituximab complete treatment period Week 36 , qualify , option enter optional extension re-treatment period . Patients qualify choose receive optional extension re-treatment enter approximately 1-year safety follow-up period . After safety follow-up period , patient remain peripherally CD19-positive B-cell deplete entered B-cell follow-up period follow every 12 week peripheral CD19-positive B cell return baseline value low limit normal , whichever low . Group B patient qualify and/or choose treatment rituximab complete study end primary study period ( Week 12 ) .</detailed_description>
