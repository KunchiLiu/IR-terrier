	<brief_summary>The propose research design establish lymphedema incidence rate vary population breast cancer patient . Patients breast preservation , mastectomy , sentinel lymph node biopsy , axillary dissection radiation therapy include goal determine impact treatment development lymphedema . Establishing incidence population crucial remainder study . We conduct two phase study . The first phase use arm measurement , symptom survey ( The Lymphedema Breast Questionnaire ) , functional survey ( Disability Arm , Shoulder , Hand Questionnaire ) , operative pathology information create simple screen tool predict development lymphedema . Currently , lymphedema diagnose arm swelling develops . The goal screen tool identify patient significantly increase risk development lymphedema compare general population breast cancer survivor . Phase 2 study test lymphedema prevention strategy high risk population . The goal phase reduce incidence lymphedema patient undergone axillary node dissection radiation therapy use combination education , compression sleeve decongestive exercise . If prevention successful , development screen tool becomes even important identify patient undergo prevention regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Screening Tool Treatment Lymphedema Secondary Management Breast Cancer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Lymphedema vary definition , base limb volume change . None incorporate limb volume change , symptom , functional deficit . We determine incidence lymphedema breast cancer patient impact breast conserve therapy , radiation therapy , sentinel lymph node biopsy , axillary node dissection . The impact lymphedema evaluate number way ; 1 ) The Lymphedema Breast Cancer Questionnaire ( LBCQ ) identify symptoms unique patient lymphedema 2 ) The Disability Arm , Hand , Shoulder ( DASH ) survey use determine functional impact lymphedema . Objective/Hypothesis : Our hypothesis : 1 ) Local therapy breast cancer result different lymphedema rate depend combination therapy use . 2 ) A simple screening tool incorporate symptom , limb volume measurement , tumor stag treatment modality predict patient develop lymphedema . 3 ) Functional impairment arm severe patient lymphedema . 4 ) Prevention lymphedema high risk population possible education , compression sleeve , decongestive exercise . Specific Aims : 1 ) Evaluate patient pre-operatively specific time interval post-operatively establish incidence lymphedema sentinel lymph node biopsy axillary dissection group . 2 ) Create simple screen tool use arm measurement , symptom identify LBCQ , treatment stag information identify patient go test treatment . 3 ) Utilize DASH survey measure extent disability lymphedema surgical treatment . 4 ) Conduct randomize trial lymphedema prevention high-risk breast cancer population . Study Design : This proposal conduct two phase . Phase 1 accomplish Specific Aim 1 , 2 , 3 . Patients newly diagnose breast cancer await definitive surgery , enrol pre-operatively undergo arm measurement complete LBCQ DASH survey . These study procedure complete 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month postoperative . Documentation collect study include : demographic information ; co-morbid condition ; operative pathology report ; use adjuvant therapy chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiation therapy . Incidence rate lymphedema impact extent surgery radiation therapy determine . We also use information develop simple screen tool identify patient develop lymphedema prior development significant limb volume change . Specific Aim 4 Phase 2 proposal . A high risk population ( axillary node dissection radiation therapy ) randomize standard education versus standard education , compression sleeve , exercise . The effectiveness prevention reduce incidence severity lymphedema impact symptom functional impairment determine . This work move toward new paradigm lymphedema management simple screen tool identify high risk patient significant swell occurs investigate prevention strategy decrease incidence lymphedema . Cancer Relevance : Lymphedema fear complication breast cancer treatment . Currently recognize treat development significant limb volume change symptomatic difficult treat . Documentation impact local therapy development lymphedema allow clinician make informed decision regard risk benefit ratio local therapy . Development screen tool allow u identify high risk population . Ideally , high risk population identify effective prevention strategy implement . Phase one study help answer question regard incidence create screen tool phase two allow evaluation prevention strategy .</detailed_description>
