	<detailed_description>Introduction : Much practice surgical wound closure subsequent care base upon tradition individual preference rather science . Most patient undergo cesarean delivery Hartford Hospital subcuticular running closure . Occasionally , patient staple closure , discretion operate surgeon . With newly introduce wound closure technique , intend compare approve closure technique ( Dermabond ) traditional suture closure via prospective , observer blind , randomize , control trial . Methods : Study participant include woman provide informed consent prior undergoing cesarean section Hartford Hospital . Patients exclude study require vertical skin incision ; allergic Dermabond ; temperature &gt; 100.2 F preop intraop . Qualified patient randomize skin closure either Dermabond wound closure technique suture . Closure method randomization perform prospectively placing closure modality option opaque seal envelope prior initiation study . The envelope available operating room . The circulate nurse open envelope reveal randomization arm prior skin closure surgeon utilize indicated technique . The circulate nurse record length time need close skin incision . The surgeon complete short survey immediately post operatively regard ease use closure modality well expect cosmetic outcome . If patient randomized suture , surgeon preference dictate whether 4-0 vicryl 4-0 monocryl use well whether Keith curve needle utilized . Patient demographic contact information obtain prior initiation procedure . Prior initiation surgery , operative field prepare dry shave site disposable razor cleanse abdomen Betadine use sterile technique . Hibiclens soap substitute patient sensitive allergic iodine . A first generation Cephalosporin administer ~ 30 minute preop patient undergo schedule cesarean delivery . If procedure unscheduled , first generation Cephalosporin administer cord clamp patient already receive antibiotic preoperatively . The patient ' post operative pain medicine requirement pain self assessment score monitor post operative hospital course document medication log chart . Most patient discharge postoperative day three four unless complication arise . All patient see office 6-week post partum follow . A medical professional ass wound . The patient medical professional query regard satisfaction cosmetic outcome wound . The patient also query regard continue pain medicine requirement . If patient show post partum visit , call obtain information arrange time follow-up . Each medical professional provide disposable camera . The camera use take picture patient 's wound 6-week follow visit . Specific guideline provide regard distance angle picture take ensure optimal uniform photo clarity . The picture review late time panel observer blind type wound closure patient receive . The observer assess picture wound cosmesis heal provide standardized objective evaluation wound closure outcome . Power Sample Size : The primary outcome surgical time ( wound closure ) , patient satisfaction blind observer-rated cosmesis . Using 1:3 randomization scheme , group sample size 25 ( test/Dermabond ) 75 ( control/suture ) would achieve 80 % power detect difference 1.0 null hypothesis group mean satisfaction cosmesis 3.0 ( `` average '' ) alternative hypothesis mean Dermabond group 2.0 ( `` average '' ) estimate group standard deviation 1.5 significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 use two-sided , two-sample t-test . Assuming average closure time suture group 6 minute ( SD +/-1 ) , hypothesize average closure time Dermabond group 1.5 minute ( SD +/- 0.5 minute ) , sample size would afford well 99 % power detect difference surgical ( closure ) time two group . The Women 's Health Department Hartford Hospital performs average 12 procedure per week ( range 10-15 ) . If 70 % eligible woman consent participate , take approximately 12 week accrue minimum number subject . However , participation rate 80 % -85 % , 10-11 week require accrual . Data Analysis / Statistics : Descriptive statistic continuous variable ( e.g. , height , weight , maternal age , gestational age , surgical ( closure ) time ) consist mean , standard deviation 95 % confidence interval . Frequencies race ethnicity also run . To evaluate primary outcome treatment arm , difference closure time , patient satisfaction observe healing , t-tests utilized . Subgroup comparison ( e.g. , within suture group curve Keith needle ) also perform t-tests . Secondary analysis dichotomous ( yes/no ) variable , include surgeon response `` Did find method effective ? '' `` Did find method burdensome ? '' evaluate c2 test . Although infection may occur note , rate anticipate low statistical assessment necessary . Statistically significant difference consider analysis result p &lt; 0.05 . All analysis perform SPSS v. 11.5 ( Chicago , IL , 2003 ) .</detailed_description>
