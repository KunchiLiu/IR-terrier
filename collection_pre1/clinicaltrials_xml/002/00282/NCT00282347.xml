	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Rituximab Subjects With International Society Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society ( ISN/RPS ) 2003 Class III IV Lupus Nephritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In addition receiving study drug ( rituximab placebo ) , participant treatment group receive mycophenolate mofetil start dose 1500 mg/day IV 3 divide dos titrate 500 mg/week 3000 mg/day Week 4 , tolerate . Participants treatment group also receive methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV prior 3 day follow first study drug infusion methylprednisolone 100 mg IV prior study drug infusion . Participants treatment group also receive diphenhydramine 50 mg orally acetaminophen 1000 mg orally 30-60 minute prior study drug infusion . From Days 2 16 , participant treatment group receive prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day orally ( maximum dose 60 mg ) except day second methylprednisolone dose . On Day 16 , taper initiate achieve dose 10 mg/day Week 16 .</detailed_description>
