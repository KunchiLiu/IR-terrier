In rodent specific role serotonin-1b receptor report ( Olivier et al . 1995 ) show specific central serotonin-1b/d agonist lipophilic triptans specific anti-aggressive effect . To date , study conduct treatment hostility , impulsivity aggression among human use triptan . Goal Study Aim establish efficacy naratriptan , register treatment migraine , anti-aggressive agent patient refractory disorder impulse control due psychosis psychopathy . Primary question whether violent behavior aggressive incident decrease naratriptan administer daily addition treatment usual . Secondary question : - Does overall prognosis underlie condition improve intervention ? - Can responder differentiate non-responders term covariants include endocrine factor polymorphisms area genome involve serotonergic neurotransmission ? - Is triptan well tolerate group dose-range ? Study Design Population The sample consist male adult volunteer psychiatric disorder convict sentenced undergo psychiatric treatment Forensic Psychiatric Hospital `` De Kijvelanden '' commit violent crime previous year involve violent incident least three time spite comprehensive psychiatric treatment underlie disorder . Intervention /Drug /Dosage In course four-week period either naratriptan 2.5 mg. tablet placebo tablet add twice daily medication double blind randomized fashion . Subsequently , two-week washout , patient cross-over towards alternative treatment condition another four-week period . Endpoints Outcome measure use AVL ( aggression questionnaire ) SDAS ( social dysfunction aggression scale ) 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 week treatment . Change CGI ( Clinical Global Impression ) compare baseline . As usual study-site , SOAS-R ( Staff Observation Aggression Scale ) fill case violent incident type , number duration restrain intervention register . Also record symptom occur treatment number cause dropout . Description Estimate Risk Burden Participants Safety tolerability naratriptan placebo well document . Incidence nature side-effects interaction describe low relatively mild , also frequent ( daily ) use naratriptan . Patients risk side-effects exclude study . Drugs add usual medication participant . A questionnaire administer blood collect upon inclusion study . Data include genotype process anonymously .</detailed_description>
