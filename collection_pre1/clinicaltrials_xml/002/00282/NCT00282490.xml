	<brief_title>Surface Nerve Stimulation Treatment OAB Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Daytime urinary incontinence common child . At age 7 prevalence 2-9 % report . Daytime urinary incontinence heterogenic multifactorial illness symptom several degree severity cause different mechanism . Daytime urinary incontinence etiologically classify rare neurogenic structural form common functional idiopathic form ( neurological structural cause bladder dysfunction identify . The symptom base diagnosis OAB ( overactive bladder ) often use describe daytime urinary incontinence child . OAB define symptom syndrome include urgency without urge incontinence combination frequency . When urinary tract infection neurogenic structural cause exclude nonpharmacological bladder rehabilitation first line treatment OAB . It expect approximately 50 % child relieve symptom treatment . In non-responding case behavioural modify regime couple anticholinergic medication . However , poor compliance child parent , dose limit side effect often influence efficacy intervention . Also considerable number child experience limited effect treatment even though instruction comply . This let research new treatment modality use low frequency electrical current inhibit detrusor overactivity adult become common . Pilot study indicate significant effect TENS urinary incontinence child OAB . Hypothesis : - Sacral TENS effective treatment urinary incontinence child OAB refractory anticholinergic medication couple bladder training void reeducation . - The acute effect sacral TENS identify urodynamics - It possible predict outcome sacral TENS treatment child . 30 child ( age 5-14 year ) functional daytime incontinence refractory anticholinergic medication couple bladder training . The study protocol consist 1 week basic home registration 4 day in-patient phase succeed 4 week home training period . The participant randomize treatment either active inactive TENS .</detailed_description>
