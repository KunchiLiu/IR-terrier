	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) systemic autoimmune inflammatory disorder cause substantial pain joint tenderness , significant joint damage , serious disability . The treatment goal minimization sign symptom disease , reduction irreversible joint damage . As understanding pathophysiological mechanism underlie RA elucidate , opportunity target specific inflammatory process new therapy improve . Rheumatoid arthritis T cell-mediated autoimmune disease various therapy , include new experimental therapy , target either activation T cell neutralization effector mechanism . These new therapy show benefit human animal model RA . Extracorporeal photoimmune therapy ( ECP ) show safe effective palliative treatment skin manifestation cutaneous T cell lymphoma . Experimental study also demonstrate activity ECP treatment several T cell mediate disease include graft versus-host disease , rejection organ transplantation , select autoimmune disease . This study evaluate cell-based therapy ( ECP ) patient inadequate response disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) biological agent determine ECP treatment reduce sign symptom RA refractory patient population .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must history RA per ACR criterion classification RA . Patients must moderately severely active RA . Moderately severely active RA patient define patient meet follow classification criterion , upon review physician , screening : At least nine tender joint ; At least six swollen joint ; PLUS ( least one follow ) : Morning stiffness , last great equal 45 minute ; Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate great equal 28 mm/hour ( ESR , evaluate local laboratory ) C reactive protein ( CRP ) great equal 15 mg/dL ( evaluated central laboratory ) . Patients must inadequate response continue moderately severely active disease current previous treatment least one agent follow group : methotrexate ( great equal 15 mg/week , maximum tolerate dose ) leflunomide ( 20 mg/day , maximum tolerate dose ) least 12 week prior screen ; etanercept ( great equal 25 mg/2 x week SC , maximum tolerate dose ) least 12 week prior screen , infliximab ( great equal 3 mg/kg IV , maximum tolerate dose ) least 14 week duration prior screening , adalimumab ( great equal 40 mg SC every 2 week , maximum tolerate dose ) least 12 week prior screen . Note : In individual case country access anti TNF agent limit anti TNF agent unavailable , Investigator document reason lack availability treatment . Those patient treat antiTNF agent would still eligible study fail treatment least two additional DMARDs , besides MTX and/or leflunomide . All patient may also fail treatment biological agent protein A column . Patients oral corticosteroid . OR Patients stable dose oral corticosteroid prednisone equivalent dosage great equal 15 mg/day least 4 week prior screen . Patients must platelet count great equal 100,000/cmm . Female patient must one following : postmenopausal , surgically incapable bearing child , practice acceptable method birth control ( acceptable method may include hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , spermicide barrier ) . Abstinence partner/spouse sterility may also qualify Investigator 's discretion . If female patient childbearing potential , must negative urine pregnancy test screening . Patients must able willing comply study procedure . Patients must willing sign ICF . Patients must great equal 18 year age . Patients must body weight great equal 40 kg ( 88 lb ) . Patients form arthritis arthropathy , RA , current inflammatory condition might confound assessment ( e.g. , connective tissue diseases Lyme disease ) . Patients enrol investigational therapy study treatment RA within 4 week prior start Treatment Period , patient schedule receive investigational therapy plasma base apheresis procedure ( e.g. , protein A column ) treatment RA course study . Patients unable tolerate extracorporeal volume shift associate ECP treatment due presence follow condition : uncompensated congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , severe asthma , renal failure , hepatic failure . Patients poor tolerability venipuncture lack adequate venous access require treatment blood sampling . Note : Every attempt make enroll patient adequate peripheral venous access . Patients know hypersensitivity allergy psoralen ( methoxsalen ) . Patients know hypersensitivity allergy heparin citrate product . Patients take follow permitted DMARDs biological agent stable dose specific indicate period time prior screening : MTX least 8 week ; leflunomide least 8 week ; infliximab least 14 week ; etanercept least 12 week ; adalimumab least 12 week . Patients take follow permitted medication stable dose least 4 week prior screen : NSAIDs ; anakinra ; hydroxychloroquine ; chloroquine ; sulfasalazine ; Dpenicillamine ; gold salt ; azathioprine ; oral corticosteroid ( great equal 15 mg/day , prednisone equivalent dose ) . Patients Investigator believe maintain stable dos permit concomitant RA medication throughout Treatment Period . Patients take follow prohibited medication : cyclophosphamide ; chlorambucil ; intramuscular ( IM ) intravenous ( IV ) corticosteroid injection ( ) , within 4 week screen ; intraarticular corticosteroid injection ( ) &gt; 60 mg prednisone equivalent total dose , within 4 week screen . Patients know malignant disease ( basal cell carcinoma ) currently within last 5 year . Patients preexist blood dyscrasia bone marrow hypoplasia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , significant anemia , coagulation disorder . Patients persistent severe infection within 12 week screen . Patients history drug alcohol abuse within 12 week screen . Patients impaired hepatic function screen show abnormal liver function test ( LFT ; i.e. , aspartate transaminase [ AST ] alanine transaminase [ ALT ] level &gt; 2 x upper limit normal [ ULN ] ) .
