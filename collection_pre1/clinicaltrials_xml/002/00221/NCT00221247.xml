	<brief_summary>Background : Cerebral palsy ( CP ) frequent cause childhood disability US . Nevertheless , current standard care CP U.S. large extent ineffective . The Chinese , hand , claim exceptionally high response rate administration integrate package care include combination intense 'conventional ' therapy acupuncture . Despite numerous anecdotal report , claim yet test rigorous scientific way . Objective : To determine effectiveness acupuncture use adjunct intense 'conventional ' physical , occupational , hydro- therapy improve function quality life child spastic CP . Hypotheses : ( 1 ) Adjunctive acupuncture therapy improve gross fine motor function health relate quality life child spastic CP intense 'conventional ' therapy alone . ( 2 ) The level persistence gross fine motor function health relate quality life achieve adjunctive acupuncture administer combination intense 'conventional ' therapy higher achieve intense 'conventional ' therapy alone . Design : A parallel , two-arm , prospective , evaluation-blind , pragmatic , non-inferiority , randomize control clinical trial ( RCT ) . Setting : This international collaborative study conduct two different locality : ( 1 ) At Beijing Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) , participant ' recruitment , intervention therapy , videotape evaluation , data collection do , ( 2 ) At University Arizona , score videotape evaluation data analysis do , logistic support provide assure scientific integrity study . Population : Approximately 100 child age 1 6 year spastic CP . Intervention : Concurrent administration acupuncture intense 'conventional ' therapy outset study vs. sequential administration component . Outcomes : 'Gross Motor Function ' , 'Fine Motor Function ' , 'Range Motion ' , 'Level Motor Involvement ' , 'Health-Related Quality Life ' measure time 0,4,8,12,24 , 36 week . Evaluation : Independent blind evaluation respect type intervention stage therapeutic schedule do U.S. base videotape film China . Data management : Web-based data center intersite-networking infrastructure . Data analysis : Intention treat analysis supplement linear mixed effect model nest grouping factor . Significance future direction : If hypothesis confirm study would lay groundwork future research , impact clinical practice health care policy relate CP therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study parallel , two-arm , prospective , evaluation-blind , randomize control clinical trial ( RCT ) . It design examine effectiveness acupuncture use adjunct intense 'conventional ' physical , occupational , hydro- therapy improve function quality life child spastic cerebral palsy ( CP ) . This international collaborative study conduct two location : ( 1 ) At Beijing Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) , participant ' recruitment , intervention therapy , videotape evaluation , data collection do , ( 2 ) At University Arizona , score videotape evaluation data analysis do , logistic support provide assure scientific integrity study . The specific aim propose study : Specific Aim # 1 : To compare outcomes achieved 12 week acupuncture administer concurrently intense 'conventional ' therapy ( physical , occupational , hydro-therapies ) achieve intense 'conventional ' therapy alone management child spastic CP . Hypothesis # 1 : Adjunctive acupuncture administer concurrently intense 'conventional ' therapy improve gross fine motor function health relate quality life child spastic CP intense 'conventional ' therapy alone , determine standardized measure ( see pgs . 20-22 ) . Specific Aim # 2 : To examine short intermediate term persistence change outcomes achieve acupuncture administer concurrently intense 'conventional ' therapy ( physical , occupational , hydro-therapies ) achieve intense 'conventional ' therapy alone management child spastic CP . Hypothesis # 2 : When compare three month termination therapy , level gross fine motor function health relate quality life achieve acupuncture administer concurrently intense 'conventional ' therapy ( physical , occupational , hydro-therapies ) high achieve intense 'conventional ' therapy alone . Taking advantage fact ethically Chinese child spastic CP would participate study ought receive acupuncture one point another part care ( see pg . 12 ) propose , secondary aim , begin examine whether time administration adjunctive acupuncture relation time administration intense 'conventional ' therapy effect outcomes , determine standardized measure . It emphasize , study aim primarily test sequence effect related appropriate timing administration adjunctive acupuncture treatment child spastic CP since ) must first examine whether acupuncture effect population , b ) test sequence effect would greatly complicate design study point may render feasible . Rather , simply take advantage ethical obligation provide every participant acupuncture point time ( proven efficacy standpoint standard care China ) begin explore potential temporal relationship administration adjunctive acupuncture outcome . For example , since Group 1 would receive adjunctive acupuncture concurrently intense 'conventional ' therapy whereas Group 2 would receive adjunctive acupuncture therapy subsequently intense 'conventional ' therapy ( see Figure 1 pg . 11 ) , design allow begin explore whether adjunctive acupuncture administer subsequent intense 'conventional ' therapy may booster effect degree gross fine motor function health relate quality life child spastic CP .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children age 12 72 month . Children diagnosis spastic cerebral palsy ( CP ) mix type CP spasticity dominant feature . Age Any child CP young 12 month old 72 month . Etiology Any damage CNS either ( ) static nature , degenerative progressive central nervous disorder , ( b ) occur first year life , ( c ) child phenotypic pattern suggest chromosomal abnormality ( e.g. , trisomy 13 18 ) . Diagnosis Children diagnosis spastic CP mixedtype CP spasticity dominant feature establish absolute certainty , child dyskinetic CP . Rationale To assure subject homogeneity , case disagreement physician respect diagnosis child , even one physician feel certain child spastic CP , child would automatically exclude . Comorbidities Medical condition , whether acute chronic , acupuncture intense 'conventional ' therapy consider contraindicate . Rationale assure participant ' safety . Cointerventions Any child receive schedule receive treatment ( ) study period may confound result ( e.g. , orthopedic neurosurgical procedure , Botulinum toxin injection , Baclofen pump hyperbaric oxygen treatment ) . Rationale To avoid threat causal inference . Parallel participation another CP clinical trial . Rationale To avoid pragmatic ethical issue may arise result conflict interest limit resource .</criteria>
