	<brief_summary>Over 30 study show exercise improve physical fitness , reduce fatigue , increase functioning , enhance overall quality life ( QoL ) breast cancer survivor treatment . Research also show , however , breast cancer survivor experience significant reduction physical activity treatment recover even year treatment complete . The objective study examine effect two behavior change intervention ( step pedometer print material ) physical activity , social cognitive variable , QoL population-based sample breast cancer survivor . Approximately 300 breast cancer survivor live Northern Alberta randomize one four group : ( 1 ) exercise recommendation group ( view current standard care ) , ( 2 ) exercise recommendation plus pedometer group , ( 3 ) exercise recommendation plus printed material group , ( 4 ) exercise recommendation plus pedometer printed material group . Our primary hypothesis participant receive combine pedometer print material intervention report great change physical activity . Our secondary hypothesis intervention also result improved QoL positive social cognitive belief exercise breast cancer survivor . Given geographic dispersion population , find practical sustainable intervention employ distance medicine-based approach may ideal promote healthy activity pattern breast cancer survivor Northern Alberta .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 300 breast cancer survivor live Northern Alberta randomize one four group : ( 1 ) exercise recommendation group ( view current standard care ) , ( 2 ) exercise recommendation plus pedometer group , ( 3 ) exercise recommendation plus printed material group , ( 4 ) exercise recommendation plus pedometer printed material group . Our primary hypothesis participant three intervention group report great positive change physical activity participant exercise recommendation group . Furthermore , expect participant receive combine pedometer print material intervention report great change physical activity . Our secondary hypothesis intervention also result improved QoL positive social cognitive belief exercise breast cancer survivor . Our sample size determine power calculation . Based literature , believe increase 2,000 step per day meaningful change result health benefit breast cancer survivor . We estimate standard deviation 4,000 step per day . Therefore , detect medium standardize effect ( = .50 ) power .80 two-tailed alpha &lt; .05 , need 63 participant per group . To account possible 15 % loss follow , randomize 75 participant group . Our printed material develop base tenet theory plan behavior include activity design enhance instrumental affective attitude , injunctive descriptive norm , self-efficacy perception control . These material develop base previous research identify key belief target theory plan behavior-based intervention . Our procedure identify screen potential participant eligibility Alberta Cancer Registry . After obtain write informed consent individual â€™ treat oncologist , eligible participant send letter invitation participate study . Interested participant complete baseline questionnaire include measure physical activity ( Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire ) , QoL ( Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Breast Anemia ) , social cognitive variable theory plan behavior ( base guideline Ajzen previous research ) . Participants also wear pedometer 7-day monitoring period obtain baseline step . Participants randomize one four group . Depending randomization , participant receive appropriate material . All group recommend accumulate least 30 minute moderate intensity physical activity least five day per week would result 15,000 step per week ( 2,000 step per day ) . At end 12-week intervention period , participant complete post intervention questionnaire undergo another 7-day monitoring period obtain step value . Participants contact 6 month follow-up complete questionnaire final time .</detailed_description>
