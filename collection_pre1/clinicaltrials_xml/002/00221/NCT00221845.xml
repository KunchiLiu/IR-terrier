	<brief_summary>In child chronic kidney disease , progression end-stage renal failure associate high patient morbidity poor quality life . In adult , inhibition renin angiotensin system ( RAS ) slow rate renal failure progression . This concept yet unproven child , chronic renal failure ( CRF ) commonly due hypo/dysplastic malformation acquire glomerulopathies typical adult chronic kidney disease . The current project aim assess genetic molecular mechanism cardiovascular consequence progressive CRF develop strategy pharmacological renoprotection child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease affect nephron mass characterize progressive decline glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) occur irrespectively cause renal damage critical number nephron lose . Current clinical research effort focus preventive strategy slow arrest disease progression . Systemic hypertension glomerular hyperfiltration result proteinuria activation vasoactive , profibrotic proinflammatory system identify major cause nephron damage . Angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor potent antihypertensive agent also reduce proteinuria , glomerulosclerosis tubulointerstitial fibrosis via reduction local angiotensin tone kidney , demonstrate slow renal failure progression adult patient . Childhood-onset ESRD rare particularly devastate disease poor life expectancy quality life . Chronic renal failure child cause different spectrum nephropathy adult , preponderance congenital inherited abnormality . Since hypertension , proteinuria tubulointerstitial fibrosis also common pediatric chronic renal failure , rationale pharmacological renoprotection ACE inhibition child . The prospective , randomized European clinical trial launch consortium provide critical mass ass several aspect renoprotective therapy child . Specifically , trial design address follow scientific objective : Objective 1 evaluate whether ACE inhibition equally effective slow progression rate chronic renal failure child different congenital acquire renal disorder . 400 pediatric patient stratify accord underlying disease , rate loss glomerular filtration rate assess 6 month 5 year start treatment ACE inhibitor ramipril . Objective 2 trial evaluate whether renal failure progression patient treat fix dose ramipril slow additional antihypertensive treatment , achieve blood pressure 50th percentile . To end , patient randomize upon initiation ramipril either intensified ( aim 50th percentile 24-hour mean arterial pressure ) conventional antihypertensive treatment . Several gene polymorphism describe may affect rate renal failure progression and/or individual susceptibility ACE inhibition . These polymorphism include gene encode key protein renin-angiotensin system extracellular matrix turnover . In addition , screen novel polymorphism gene determine structural protein glomerular filter , search gene mutation cause renal hypo-/dysplasia . Objective 3 evaluate whether mutation predict spontaneous disease progression therapeutic response ACE inhibition intensify blood pressure control . Glomerular endothelin ( ET1 ) synthesis upregulated chronic renal failure , urinary ET1 excretion correlate disease progression . ET1 antagonists partially preserve renal function decrease proteinuria independent angiotensin tone . Objective 4 trial ass ET1 turnover start ACE inhibition , evaluate possible predictive role ET1 and/or ET1 degrade peptidase excretion persistence proteinuria disease progression ACE inhibition intensify antihypertensive therapy . Long-term survival child chronic renal failure compromise precocious atherosclerosis excessive cardiovascular morbidity . Objective 5 assess correlate prospectively metabolic cause morphological consequence uremic cardiovascular disease child , define relationship disease progression ACE inhibition intensify blood pressure control . Homocysteine metabolism , apolipoprotein variability , gene polymorphism putatively involved atherosclerosis , inflammation state , myocardial function carotid intima-media thickness assess compare reference group age-matched healthy child .</detailed_description>
