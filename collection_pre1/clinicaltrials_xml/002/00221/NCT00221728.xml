	<detailed_description>Background . Surgical treatment multiple recurrent renal tumor may complicate renal function impairment . Mini-invasive thermotherapy radiofrequency ( RF ) , induce necrosis tumoral tissue spar normal renal parenchyma . Objectives . The main objective ass 5-year local carcinologic efficacy ( residual tumor tissue recurrence site treatment ) radiofrequency treatment . Secondary objective assess 5-year overall carcinologic efficacy , predictive factor technical success RF procedure , general renal tolerance 5 year treatment . Study design . Open label , randomize , parallel-group , multicentric clinical trial ( 9 center ) . Eligibility criterion . Patients renal tumor surgical treatment may result renal function impairment . Intervention . Experimental group : radiofrequency treatment , percutaneous laparoscopy , use RF 3000â„¢ generator ( Radiotherapeutics , Boston scientific ) standardize heat protocol . A second procedure allow case residual tumoral tissue tumor recurrence . Control group : conservative kidney surgery . Outcomes . The principal outcome 5-year local carcinologic efficacy ( residual tumor tissue recurrence site treatment , assess tomodensitometry MRI injection ) . Secondary outcomes 5-year overall carcinologic efficacy ( local efficacy metastasis ) , renal function , technical success RF procedure ( residual tumor tissue 2 month procedure ) tolerance . Follow-up . Clinical , biological image follow-up schedule 2 month , 6 month , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 year first treatment .</detailed_description>
