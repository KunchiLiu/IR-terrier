	<detailed_description>Binge eat disorder ( BED ) characterize recurrent , uncontrollable , distress episode excessive food consumption ( binge eat ) without compensatory weight loss behaviors.1,2 Its prevalence general population United States conservatively estimate 1.5 % 2 % ,1-6 making common anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa combine . BED associate overweight obesity.1-7 Approximately 8 % 30 % seek standard weight loss treatment , 1-4 50 % seek bariatric surgery,8,9 70 % participate Overeaters Annonymous3 estimate BED . Zonisamide structurally pharmacologically novel antiepileptic drug - sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide - proven anticonvulsant efficacy use adjunctively refractory partial epilepsy.10-12 Mechanisms hypothesize account zonisamide 's antiepileptic property include antagonism voltage-gated sodium T-type calcium channel , blockade potassium-evoked glutamate release , modulation central dopaminergic serotonergic function , carbonic anhydrase inhibition.10-16 Several line evidence suggest zonisamide might useful treatment BED . First , like anticonvulsant topiramate,17-19 zonisamide associate anorexia weight loss clinical trial epilepsy patients10,11,20 patient obesity.20 Topiramate also show reduce binge eat weight patient binge eat disorder associate obesity . 21 Although zonisamide topiramate distinct pharmacologic profile , drug share several pharmacologic action . These include sodium channel blockade , carbonic anhydrase inhibition , reduction glutamate neurotransmission . 10,11,13,16,17 Regarding latter property , animal study show stimulation lateral hypothalamus glutamate glutamate agonist cause intense , rapid , dose-dependent increase food intake,22 whereas glutamate antagonism nucleus tractus solitarius reduces food intake.23 Second , unlike topiramate , zonisamide also modulate function serotonin dopamine14 , 15 -- two neurotransmitter involve regulation feed behavior24 mechanism medication efficacy either binge eating ( SSRIs , d-fenfluramine ) 25-29 obesity ( sibutramine , stimulant ) .30 Third , broad range antidepressant report reduce binge eat bulimia nervosa31 binge eat disorder25-28,32 preliminary observation suggest zonisamide may thymoleptic properties.33,34 Fourth , open-label trial zonisamide 15 patient BED conduct group , zonisamide effective reduce binge eating frequency , severity illness , weight ( S.L . McElroy , J Clin Psychiatry , review ) .35 We therefore propose conduct double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , parallel group , 16-week study zonisamide 60 outpatient binge eat disorder obesity .</detailed_description>

Men woman , age 18 65 . The patient population expect predominantly make woman base previous research . Have current body mass index &lt; 30kg/m2 . Women pregnant lactate woman childbearing potential take adequate contraceptive measure . If possibility female subject might pregnant , pregnancy test perform . ( All woman childbearing potential negative pregnancy test enter study . ) Subjects display clinically significant suicidality homicidality . Subjects display current clinically unstable depressive disorder ( e.g. , HAMD &gt; 21 ) . A current recent ( within 6 month start study medication ) DSMIV diagnosis substance abuse dependence . A lifetime history DSMIV bipolar disorder dementia . History personality disorder ( eg , schizotypal , borderline , antisocial ) might interfere assessment compliance study procedure . Clinically unstable medical disease , include cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , gastrointestinal , pulmonary , metabolic , endocrine systemic disease could interfere diagnosis , assessment , treatment binge eat disorder . Patients biochemically euthyroid prior enter study . History seizure , include febrile seizure childhood History clinically significant nephrolithiasis . Subjects require treatment drug might interact adversely obscure action study medication ( e.g . stimulant , sympathomimetics , antidepressant , carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , antiobesity drug ) . Subjects received psychoactive medication ( zaleplon [ Sonata ] zolpidem [ Ambien ] need restlessness/insomnia ) within one week prior randomization . Subjects begin and/or receive formal psychotherapy ( cognitive behavioral therapy , interpersonal therapy , dietary behavioral therapy ) BED weight loss within past 3 month . Subjects previously enrol study previously treat zonisamide . Subjects received experimental drug use experimental device within 30 day .</criteria>
