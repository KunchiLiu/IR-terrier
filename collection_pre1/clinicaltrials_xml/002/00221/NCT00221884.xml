	<brief_summary>Many patient undergo surgery hand receive form anesthetic call `` axillary brachial plexus block '' . This involve injection local anesthetic ( freeze medication ) around nerve supply upper limb , locate arm pit . The technique currently use physician perform procedure far perfect , 1 every 5 patient work well enough allow surgery , different form anesthetic may need use . In attempt improve result , recently develop new technique , use ultrasound image `` see '' nerve prior give injection . Our initial result promise , imply may highly successful safe approach . The purpose study determine technique indeed successful . In order , ask 110 patient participation . They divide two group , random . One group receive standard technique ( transarterial , use small needle find artery close nerve ) . The group receive injection identify nerve ultrasound image . They receive type medication , test every 5 minute half hour determine block successful , accord pre-established criterion . Their pain control assess surgery call 24 hour 1 week surgery ass recovery rule possible complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Ultrasound Upper Extremity Blocks .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasonography use successfully define anatomy brachial plexus interscalene , supraclavicular axillary region . This widely available technology , non-invasive , portable , less expensive imaging modality allow real time image simultaneously block procedure . There recent case report small case series describe use ultrasound image brachial plexus guide brachial plexus blockade 16,17,18 . We use ultrasound image succesfully identify brachial plexus guide needle localization nerve stimulation 15 volunteer 19 . In healthy volunteer , able identify brachial plexus every subject , four different anatomical level : interscalene , supraclavicular , axillary mid-humeral ( see figure ) . Needle localization nerve stimulation also successful every case . Moreover , preliminary data ongoing series institution , show ultrasound guidance use , supraclavicular brachial plexus block perform high success rate ( 97 % ) 20 . However , whether ultrasound guidance truly improve success rate compare traditional technique still unknown . There randomize control trial publish date address question .</detailed_description>
