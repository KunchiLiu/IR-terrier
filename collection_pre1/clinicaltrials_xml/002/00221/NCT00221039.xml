	<detailed_description>Objectives : The study objective demonstrate UVADEX® Sterile Solution formulation methoxsalen use conjunction UVAR XTS Photopheresis System clinical effect skin manifestation CTCL ( mycosis fungoides ) early stage disease . Methodology : Single-arm , open-label treatment use UVAR XTS Photopheresis System . Treatment consist two photopheresis treatment successive day every 4 week six month . Those patient complete first 6-month period may continue photopheresis 6-month follow-up period . Patients respond photopheresis therapy 6 month may concurrent therapy low dose bexarotene interferon add outline protocol . Number Patients ( Planned Analyzed ) : The study plan minimum 50 patient Diagnosis Main Criteria Inclusion : Male female patient CTCL diagnosis stage IA , IB IIA measurable skin lesion ( patch plaque ) minor blood abnormality . Patients must refractory least one treatment early stage CTCL PUVA , Electron beam , oral steroid , high potency topical steroid , topical nitrogen mustard , methotrexate , interferon , bexarotene . Test Product , Dose Mode Administration , Batch Lot Number : UVADEX liquid methoxsalen 20mcg/mL conjunction UVAR XTS Photopheresis System . UVADEX inject photoactivation bag photopheresis therapy accordance approve drug package insert UVAR XTS operator 's manual . UVADEX dose less 200mcg per treatment . Duration Treatment : The study consist 2 treatment period , 6-month initial period 6-month follow-up period photopheresis therapy may continue . Criteria Evaluation : Efficacy : The primary endpoint overall response base skin-weighted assessment . Secondary endpoint also include time response , duration response , `` Quality Life `` assessment . The size number lymph node flow cytometry analysis also consider . Experienced skin observer perform skin score patient enrollment . Skin score record percentage patient 's body involved patch plaque lesion . A successful response therapy patient great 50 % improvement skin involvement ( PR ) complete skin improvement ( CR ) without worsen node , blood visceral organ . Patients 25 % -50 % improvement consider minor response ( MR ) , + - 25 % SD , PD define 25 % worsen baseline . Safety : Safety assess incidence intensity adverse event , whether clinical base laboratory result . Statistical Methods : The primary endpoint proportion patient CR PR skin lesion .</detailed_description>
