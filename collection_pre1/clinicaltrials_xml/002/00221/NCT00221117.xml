	<brief_summary>Functional electrical stimulation process use low intensity electrical pulse generate electric stimulator create muscle contraction . By contract muscle specific sequence , one generate various body function grasp , walk , standing.The study design evaluate effectiveness long term benefit apply functional electrical simulation early rehabilitation improve grasp function person suffer spinal cord injury . By use functional electrical stimulation , patient could potentially improve grasp function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits Applying Neuroprosthesis Improve Grasping Reaching Spinal Cord Injury Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective study determine effectiveness new treatment regime use neuroprosthesis improvement recovery grasp function person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . This treatment show useful stroke patient hemiplegic arm recovery reach grasp 1 , preliminary work indicates may also case SCI patient 3 . Further , aside potential promote voluntary grasp SCI patient , novel therapeutic approach may also impact way service currently deliver SCI rehabilitation setting . A neuroprosthesis grasp device improve restore grasping , hold , release function person SCI 2 , 3 . The neuroprosthesis apply functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) artificially generate muscle contraction apply short current pulse motor nerve innervate muscle . FES applied individual incomplete SCI help restore function walk grasp contract group paralyze muscle orchestrate manner 4 . FES originally envision intervention 'permanent ' nature . In word , individual wear/use FES orthotic device time s/he want generate function impair SCI 4 . Our application neuroprosthesis grasp proposal present departure standard establish approach FES application . Rather people dependent neuroprosthesis perform activity daily live ( ADL ) , plan use neuroprosthesis grasp short-term intervention help SCI individual recover voluntary grasping function . Hence , believe participant undergo FES therapy neuroprosthesis able perform grasp function without use treatment program complete . Recent innovative advance FES application , spearhead team , clearly indicate short-term , therapeutic intervention neuroprosthesis grasp enhance voluntary function individual SCI 3 , 5 , 6 . These study also suggest novel method apply FES augment functional improvement potential improve overall physical psychological well person incomplete SCI . Since 1999 , Co-PI application , Dr. Milos Popovic Dejan Popovic 's team University Belgrade report anecdotal evidence C5 C7 SCI individual unable voluntarily grasp , later able intensive training neuroprosthesis grasp 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 . They observe approximately 20 25 % individual train FES system able grasp without assistance neuroprosthesis system remove . Although evidence present several peer-reviewed publication , comprehensive study date investigate long-term effect FES treatment recovery voluntary grasping function person SCI . Consequently , study seek 1 ) investigate whether series orchestrate FES therapy apply re-train/improve voluntary grasping function acute SCI individual , ; 2 ) determine whether therapy yield well result conventional occupational therapy . Specifically , recruit participant C5 C7 incomplete SCI . These individual typically generate weak wrist extension neither flex , extend , abduct adduct finger , flex , extend , abduct adduct thumb . Our therapy use help individual recover function .</detailed_description>
