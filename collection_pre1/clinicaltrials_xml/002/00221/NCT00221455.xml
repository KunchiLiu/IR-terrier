	<brief_summary>We seek determine patient data entry , data enter base alert , data review secure patient portal may provide sustainable approach improve diabetic outcome cost effective manner . We plan study extent portal improve diabetic outcome quality care . We recognize , however , patient predispose adopt technology predispose improve compliance others . Hence , also develop test intervention may improve adoption compliance . The goal propose study : 1 ) ass whether web portal improve care outcome diabetic patient ; 2a ) describe characteristic patient whose health behavior improve study period ; 2b ) describe characteristic patient adopt web portal-based disease management technology ; 3 ) develop test target intervention increase adoption web portal improve patient health behavior ; 4 ) monitor ongoing cost associate web portal patient healthcare resource utilization , monitor incremental cost intervention design improve utilization technology patient compliance diabetic regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Potential Technology Improve Chronic Disease Management Quality Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , limited research conduct determine health information technology ( HIT ) effective improve outcomes patient chronic disease . Research required determine intervention facilitate institutional EMR platform implement support patient chronic disease achieve improve outcome cost effective fashion . At Cleveland Clinic Foundation ( CCF ) ambulatory EMR implement foster patient safety institutional best practice guideline , facilitate research , achieve efficiency practice management . Our EMR foundation CCF patient portal . One function portal allow patient enter specific data element become part permanent medical record . Diabetics enter review home glucometer reading , view alert message base entry . The entry transfer patient 's primary care physician 's EMR In-Basket review . We recognize patient predispose technology adoption health behavior compliant others . Therefore , addition study portal 's efficacy positive diabetic behavior change , test intervention assist less predisposed less compliant patient become compliant inclined adopt technology . The goal propose study : 1 ) ass whether web portal improve care outcome diabetic patient ; 2a ) describe characteristic patient whose health behavior improve study period ; 2b ) describe characteristic patient adopt web portal-based disease management technology ; 3 ) develop test target intervention increase adoption web portal improve patient health behavior ; 4 ) monitor ongoing cost associate web portal patient healthcare resource utilization , monitor incremental cost intervention design improve utilization technology patient compliance diabetic regimen .</detailed_description>
