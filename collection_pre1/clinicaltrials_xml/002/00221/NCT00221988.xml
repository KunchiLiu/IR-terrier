	<detailed_description>III . INTRODUCTION : Background Antiepileptic Drugs And Cognitive Dysfunction Epilepsy common debilitate neurologic disorder , prevalence 6/1000 general population ( Hauser Hesdorffer , 1990 ) . Along disable psychosocial physical disadvantage accompany epilepsy , medication concern frequently report ( Gilliam F et al . 1997 ) . The majority adverse event related medication pertain cognition ( Baker GA et al . 1997 ) . A variety factor contribute cognitive dysfunction person epilepsy , one treatment antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) . The effect AEDs appear display dose dependent relationship cognitive functioning . Even strike adverse effect cognition find result AED polytherapy . Evaluation cognitive effect AEDs patient epilepsy easily confound seizure effect , underlie cerebral injury , genetic , factor , chronic impact living seizure . To limit confound cognitive effect epilepsy , investigator examine cognitive effect AEDs healthy volunteer . Meador et al . ( 1995 ) present data demonstrate mild untoward effect three common first line AEDs group young healthy adult employ randomized , double-blind , incomplete block crossover design . More one-half neurocognitive dependent variable exhibit AED effect compare non-drug baseline . Studies newer drug show variable impairment gabapentin lamotrigine showing less impairment compare old , first-line drug topiramate . Epilepsy In The Elderly The incidence epilepsy increase age advance beyond 50 . Indeed two- three-fold increase age 75 year compare age group ( Ramsay et al . 2004 ) . This special population increase risk development adverse event related AED treatment likely multiple medical condition , take numerous concomitant medication , different metabolic characteristic , likely suffer neurologic condition stroke dementia . The elderly susceptible cognitive impairment AEDs . However , little known factor affect health-related quality life senior adult epilepsy ( Martin et al. , 2003 ) 6 . All old AEDs clear pharmacokinetic disadvantage liver metabolize many know drug interaction . Levetiractam Levetiracetam approve FDA 1999 treatment epilepsy . Levetiracetam show effective pharmacologic treatment refractory partial seizure number large multicenter clinical trial ( French , et al. , 2001 ; Cramer et al. , 2003 ; Morrell et al. , 2003 ) . The pharmacokinetic profile levetiracetam particular advantage anti-epileptic drug . Pharmacologic advantage include low protein binding , renal clearance , absence drug interaction ( Perucca Johannessen , 2003. ) . For old patient epilepsy , levetiracetam likely offer excellent alternative AEDs know interact medication . Levetiracetam perform favorably adults epilepsy ( Ben-Menachem &amp; Gilland , 2003 ; Morrell et al. , 2003 ) . The efficacy levetiracetam demonstrate epilepsy old adult ( Cramer et al . 2003 ; Kraemer &amp; Edrich , 2001 ) . Clinical experience suggest Levetiracetam well-tolerated medication minimal cognitive sedative effect . Levetiracetam structural analogue piracetam , drug use nootropic ( cognitive enhancing ) agent Europe . However , recent placebo-controlled study adjunctive levetiracetam therapy intractable complex partial seizure show several CNS adverse event common placebo , include somnolence , asthenia , dizziness ( Morrell et al. , 2003 ) . The occurrence specific cognitive adverse event relatively modest range one seven per cent relative placebo . Data detail cognitive mood profile levetiracetam healthy old adult limit . Kraemer Edrich ( 2003 ) use pooled clinical trial data find difference incidence central nervous system event elderly patient young adult large clinical trial . Similarly , KEEPER trial find difference frequency side effect levetiracetam young verse adult 65 ( range 65 &gt; 85 ) . The KEEPER trial phase IV study limit interpretability open label ( Ferrendelli et al. , 2003 ) . Clinical experience consistent show good tolerability elderly ( French 2001 ; Cramer et al 2003a ; Ferrendelli et al , 2003 ; Pryor Ramsay , 2003 ; Ramsay et al,2003 ; Werz et al 2003 ; Alsaadi et al 2004 ) . However , neurocognitive mood effect levetiracetam old adult yet document well design trial specifically address issue . Studies demonstrate similar seizure-free rate second generation AEDs , main difference side effect profile . Evidenced base medicine require data support prescription practice , hypothesize current data provide support use levetiracetam older adult epilepsy . We predict significant effect study drug cognition . IV . STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Objective The primary objective study compare effect levetiracetam placebo neuropsychological mood function elderly healthy volunteer . Study Endpoints - Neuropsychological evaluation cognitive function , behavioral response , speech , mood ( See Appendix 1 ) - Early discontinuation adverse event V. STUDY DESIGN General Description This randomize , double-blind , placebo control , crossover study levetiracetam healthy old adult . The study divide 6 phase , occur total 14 week : Screen ( -2 week ) , Randomization ( 0 week ) , First Drug Treatment Period ( 4 week ) , Washout ( 2 week ) , Second Drug Treatment Period ( 4 week ) , Post-Treatment ( 2 week ) ( Appendix 2 ) . Each Drug Treatment Period divide Titration , Maintenance , Taper Phases . Following Screening , subject randomize ( 1:1 ) receive either levetiracetam placebo First Drug Treatment Period . After completion phase subsequent Washout , subject receive alternate therapy Second Drug Treatment Period . Neuropsychological test perform screening , baseline , maintenance phase .

DATA ANALYSIS A power analysis conduct determine minimum sample size need detect change neuropsychological test score formula repeat measure continuous data : N = [ 2/kZ Although within subject standard deviation ( standard deviation repeat observation individual ) unknown study levetiracetam , data similar research anti-epileptic medication publish normative data test suggest within subject standard deviation varies standardize 0.1 0.6 unit . A minimum power 0.80 (  select study . A minimum detectable difference neuropsychological test score set 0.5 unit ( half standard deviation change neuropsychological test score ) . A standardized measure mean difference select raw score neuropsychological instrument vary , convert raw score standard score allow test score compare use common metric . Based two-tailed significance 0.05 ( = .05 ) , minimum N need 18 subject ( Z = 1.96  = 0.84 ) . With 20 participant , assume within subject standard deviation 0.5 unit  = 0.05 , minimum detectable difference 0.467 standard deviation unit ( slightly less ½ standard deviation change ) . It note several neuropsychological test within subject change less 0.2 SD unit . With small within subject SD , use parameter , N = 20 yield minimum detectable difference 0.187 standard deviation unit ( small effect size ) . The change neuropsychological measure find antiepileptic medication ( e.g. , carbamazepine topiramate ) 0.2 2.5 unit ( e.g. , Meador et al. , 2001 ) . To obtain 20 complete subject , experience previous study demonstrate 50 % dropout rate . Therefore , approximately 40 subject need enrol achieve 20 complete participant study . Analyses conduct intent-to-treat per-protocol . Any subject valuable safety analysis also baseline end drug treatment period neuropsychological data available two drug period evaluate intent-to-treat analysis parameter interest . Mood neuropsychological data undergo analysis variance ( MANOVA ) appropriate two-period crossover study . Alternative form use available . To compensate practice effect evaluate measurement error , baseline define average evaluation conduct pre-treatment baseline post-treatment period ( week 12 ) .18 Subjects discontinue prematurely test two week withdraw . This consider post-treatment period subject . VIII . Risks Benefit There benefit participate study . In pivotal trial 15 % receive Levetiracetam discontinue study compare 11.6 % receive placebo . Levetiracetam report non-serious , reversible side effect . The common significant side effect levetiracetam somnolence ( i.e. , lethargy ) , asthenia , infection , dizziness , unsteady gait . Less common side effect include think abnormality , memory problem , anxiety , depression , agitation , vertigo , paresthesia . Rarely , levetiracetam associate psychotic disturbance resolve treatment discontinue ( 0.7 % ) . The adverse event profile levetiracetam generally less medication lamotrigine , topiramate , phenytoin , carbamazepine , bactrim . All study medication discontinue first sign hallucination . VIII . Compensation . Subjects compensate time inconvenience . Reimbursement assume subject invest 14 hour three month study include travel time . This significant imposition expect volunteer gainfully employ . They also undergo three blood draw inconvenience take medication almost two month . The compensation prorate amount test complete : $ 50 screen visit , $ 200 complete visit 3 ( first treatment arm ) , $ 275 give visit 5 complete study . The maximal reimbursement $ 525 . Payment make end participation study . Based subject volunteer 14 hour time , include travel time , equate $ 37.50 per hour . This participation reimbursement rate similar reimbursement rate similar study conduct institution also mirror similar academic medical center . IX . Volunteer Recruitment Confidentiality . Advertisements form flyer ( Appendix 3 ) distribute around University Hospital Case Western Reserve University hospital weekly flyer “ Monday Morning ” . Volunteers face harm grade , job status , promotion evaluation participate withdraw . Individuals within Neurology Department exclude . Information confidential . X. REFERENCES 1 .
