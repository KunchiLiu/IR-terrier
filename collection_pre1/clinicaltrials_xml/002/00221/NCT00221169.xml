	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy important part treatment lung cancer treatment intent cure . Radiation local modality treatment , , treat area radiation target . Therefore critical able visualize area tumor involvement . With current imaging test compute tomography scan ( CT ) , scan may sensitive enough detect area cancer involvement newer image test , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , investigator may able good target tumor CT scan may miss . There two clinical trial conduct Ontario Clinical Oncology Group ( OCOG ) look PET lung cancer . This proposal companion study OCOG PET lung trial . In brief , study evaluate ability CT alone versus combine PET CT image determine size tumor ( gross tumor volume ) along tiny extension cancer cell ( microscopic extension ) . The gross tumor volume extension determine CT PET CT compare measurement make surgically removed tumor . Treatment radiation therapy must include gross tumor extension order successful cure . If radiation treatment treat identify tumor chance cure lose . There two previous report ability CT determine gross tumor volume extension . There similar report use PET CT . This study first kind evaluate accurate PET CT detect gross tumor microscopic extension use surgically remove tumor measurement gold standard . If PET CT able accurately determine tumor volume include microscopic extension , help oncologist well treat lung cancer use accurate radiation treatment volume .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy important component curative treatment non-small cell lung cancer . Targeting gross tumor facilitate use CT simulation allow accurate delineation tumor . In addition multi-modality image combine functional anatomical information allow refinement treatment planning process significant impact plan target volume due addition PET image information . PET use 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) allow precise detection tumor since functional image base glucose metabolism rather structural abnormality . Biochemical change often precede gross anatomical abnormality , therefore make PET powerful image modality . FDG PET show sensitive specific CT stag NSCLC.Radical radiation therapy indicate early stage NSCLC patient medically inoperable primarily due co-morbidities . In contrast locally advance NSCLC , radical radiation use part induction therapy definitive treatment NSCLC . In order avoid geographical miss precision radiation therapy , gross tumor volume ( GTV ) outline margin around GTV add incorporate microscopic extension disease , also know clinical target volume ( CTV ) . Standard margin 1.0 1.5 cm use encompass gross tumor , microscopic extent treatment setup uncertainties.There surprisingly little data constitutes adequate margin encompass microscopic extent around gross lung tumor . Studies involve conformal radiation therapy dose escalation NSCLC primarily use empirical margin define CTV . A literature review reveal two study evaluate ability CT define gross tumor microscopic extension correlate histopathological measurement [ P Giraud et al 2000 , R Chan et al 2001 ] . The two study produce conflict result recommend margin zero mm 6-8 mm around GTV . There study evaluate ability PET define size gross tumor microscopic extension.This companion study two OCOG PET trial NSCLC . It evaluate ability CT alone versus PET CT define gross tumor microscopic extension . The methodology base contour GTV image modality CT PET CT correlate finding histopathology.This propose study add new information ability combine PET CT determine microscopic extension tumor NSCLC . While image modality detect microscopic extension , new technology PET CT may give good resolution CT alone detection tumor . The strength proposal require correlation pathological finding . If PET CT able accurately determine extent disease , major implication treatment volume subsequent target radiation therapy use 3D conformal radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
