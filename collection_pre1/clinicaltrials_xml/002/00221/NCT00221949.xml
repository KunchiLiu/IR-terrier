	<brief_summary>Peripheral nerve block limbs useful provide anesthesia pain relief orthopedic procedure limbs ( elbow , arm , knee , leg ) . Considering current nerve block technique involve locate main nerve top limb `` freezing '' neural structure order provide pain relief rest extremity , comprehensive study nerve locate low limb need . This study provide step direction development technique advance nerve blockade target nerve structure low limb provide precise pain relief rather widespread numbness . The objective study aim use direct ultrasound guidance develop comprehensive examination identification peripheral nerve low region upper low limb ( arm leg ) . In sense , process allow u `` visualize '' nerve . In future , experience visualize nerve ultrasound machine , develop technique may allow u perform anesthetic blockade great success few complication . An ultrasound exam perform 8 healthy volunteer view peripheral nerve low arm three location : elbow area , wrist area , midpoint arm elbow wrist . A set 8 healthy patient give ultrasound exam view peripheral nerve locate low leg image three location : knee area , ankle area , midpoint leg knee ankle . The appropriate nerve identify ultrasound image capture recorded corroboration . The group 16 subject allow varied observation anatomical position neural vascular structure , keep sample size fairly small . No injection make time study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The nerve upper extremity derive brachial plexus , likewise , nerve low extremity derive lumbo-sacral plexus ( 1 ) . In clinical practice , nerve block commonly perform provide postoperative analgesia orthopedic procedure involve upper low extremity ( 2,3 ) . They may also use sole anesthetic technique surgery . The two main concern upper low extremity block , regional anesthetic technique , technical failure block relate complication . The cited complication bleed inadvertent arterial venous puncture , intravascular injection local anesthetic result central nervous system cardiac toxicity , intraneural injection local anesthetic result peripheral neuropathy vary degree ( 4,5 ) . Both technical failure complication relate least part , fact technique use date blind . Anatomical landmark ( described literature ) nerve stimulators helpful way localize nerve block . We believe best approach improve success rate minimize complication peripheral nerve block use image-guided technique . In last year , different image modality use evaluate peripheral nerve upper low extremity . Studies currently underway institution seek develop comprehensive technique upper low extremity nerve block . However , involve anesthetize top limb order numb entire extremity . More research need derive comprehensive examination peripheral nerve find low region upper low extremity . While CT scan MRI probably techniques choice come diagnose nerve pathology , would useful perioperative setting due lack portability inability perform real time image simultaneously nerve block performance ( 6,7 ) . Ultrasound use successfully last year image peripheral nerve upper extremity ( 8,9 ) . The development high frequency ultrasound probe , high image resolution make possible localize evaluate peripheral nerve ultrasound , something possible 10-15 year ago . The anatomy brachial plexus describe number author . There preliminary study look possibility develop real-time ultrasound guide technique upper extremity block ( 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , ) . Studies perform institution involve refining technique upper extremity block show encouraging result . It clear , ultrasound use degree sophistication order image peripheral nerve low part upper low limb . As expressed many reference author , ultrasound use likely increase significantly come year , area diagnostic radiology clinical regional anesthesia , guide nerve block ( 17 ) . As result , evident development advance technique anesthetic blockade - target precise location nerve - derive knowledge recognition peripheral nerve locate low part limbs . To date , nonetheless , systematic evaluation nerve locate low region upper low limb ultrasound .</detailed_description>
