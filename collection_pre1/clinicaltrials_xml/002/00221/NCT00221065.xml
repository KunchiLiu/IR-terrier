	<brief_summary>`` Obstructive sleep apnea '' ( OSA ) sleep breathe disorder . When person OSA try sleep back throat close block flow air lungs.When happen , person 's sleep disrupt , cause minor awakening ( individual may recognize ) . This occur many time throughout night , cause poor sleep quality , excessive daytime sleepiness , poor concentration , sometimes depression.It possible poor outcome observe stroke patient OSA result neurocognitive phenomenon , presumably reduce effective participation rehabilitation activities.OSA treat nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) .CPAP therapy keep back throat open airflow never blocked.The study design investigate whether treatment OSA CPAP improve result rehabilitation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke occur result ischemic injury neural tissue , result cardiogenic artery artery embolism intracranial arterial thrombosis . The traditional vascular risk factor , namely hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco smoking , family history hyperlipidemia well atrial fibrillation major determinant stroke risk . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) show risk factor hypertension , although association less strong , atherosclerotic heart disease.There high prevalence OSA amongst stroke patient , order 60 70 % , tenfold high general healthy population . Recently , show , stroke patient undergoing inpatient rehabilitation , presence OSA predict poor functional outcome great length hospitalization rehabilitation unit , even adjustment stroke severity . We propose examine effect CPAP therapy neuropsychological functional outcome stroke patient OSA admit Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Stroke Rehabilitation Unit prospective , randomize study . We hypothesize , stroke patient OSA , CPAP therapy improve index vigilance , attention , cognitive performance well motor function ( OSA patient without stroke ) compare treated CPAP . Furthermore , hypothesize outcome rehabilitation , assess neuropsychological motor index , improved patient .</detailed_description>
