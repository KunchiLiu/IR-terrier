	<detailed_description>Major depression illness substantial personal economic morbidity ( Greenberg et al.1993 ) antidepressants cornerstone treatment . As antidepressant usually require 3-6 week use response occurs , effective antidepressant acceleration strategy would reduce time onset effective antidepressant response . This significant clinical implication , could lead reduce symptom morbidity , potentially reduce health care cost ( i.e . short hospital length stay ) , improve functional capacity quality life . The goal study enhance understand strategy accelerate produce rapid treatment response depression . This could lead reduce symptom morbidity , potentially reduce health care cost ( i.e . short hospital length stay ) , improve functional capacity quality life . The study goal : 1 . ) To assess whether simultaneous commencement liothyronine pindolol SSRI accelerate treatment response ( i.e . faster rate improvement ) , 2 . ) To assess whether simultaneous commencement liothyronine pindolol SSRI augment enhance treatment response ( i.e . great reduction depressive symptom end study phase ) , adn 3 . ) To assess whether gender influence acceleration augmentation response rate liothyronine pindolol .</detailed_description>
