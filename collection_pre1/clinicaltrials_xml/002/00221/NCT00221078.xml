	<brief_summary>Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) process use low intensity electrical pulse generate electric stimulator create muscle contraction . By contract muscle specific sequence , one generate various body function grasp , walk , stand . Final goal study evaluate FES training apply early rehabilitation help stroke patient use hand effectively discharge rehabilitation facility , compare patient receive FES training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits Applying Neuroprosthesis Improving Reaching Grasping Functions Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroprosthesis system apply functional electrical stimulation cause muscle contraction . If muscle contraction sequence properly one generate various function grasp , stand , walk . Recent study others pilot study indicate neuroprosthesis successfully apply training device help stroke patient hemiplegic arm relearn reach grasp various object . The objective research program confirm preliminary result broad population stroke patient , successful propose method introduce rehabilitation treatment Toronto Rehabilitation Institute , Stroke Unit primary intervention hand function recovery . Specifically , aim to1 ) develop exercise protocol use neuroprosthesis reach grasp develop team combination standard physiotherapy treatment enhance recovery hemiplegic arm hand ; 2 ) ass qualitatively quantitatively improvement reach grasp function achieve standard rehabilitation treatment .</detailed_description>
