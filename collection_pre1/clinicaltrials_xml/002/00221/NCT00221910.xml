	<detailed_description>This study randomise control trial . Its objective compare result complication two technique nerve localisation nerve block low limb . We develop real-time , image guide approach nerve block low extremity three location : femoral nerve groin sciatic nerve buttock and/or popliteal fossa . We use ultrasound image locate asess nerve low extremity use real-time guidance performance low extremity block patient undergo orthopaedic procedure . The result previous study present case series report anatomical appearance nerve study , time block performance success rate . In study aim compare parambeters standard ultrasound technique low extremity block , show advantage .</detailed_description>
