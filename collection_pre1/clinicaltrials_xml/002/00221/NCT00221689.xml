	<brief_summary>Within framework prospective double-blind randomize study evaluate efficacy continuous intrathecal baclofen therapy ( CIBT ) paroxysmal dysautonomia ( main objective ) hypertonia , recovery tolerance ( secondary objective ) initial recovery phase severe head injury , continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion deliver . The first week study double-blind : first two parallel group receive CIBT second group receive placebo . The main outcome ( number neurovegetative episode ) assess end first week . The second week study open label : active treatment continue first group second group start active CIBT treatment . The third week study , treatment stop group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrathecal Baclofen Therapy Paroxysmal Dysautonomia Severe Brain-Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . Severe brain trauma especially serious brain lesion induce coma lead many case disability . A large number patient ( 30 % ) present neurovegetative hypertonic episode associate bad vital prognosis degree disability . Several team include two France report efficacy intrathecal baclofen neurovegetative episode date able treat efficiently . Objectives . The main objective trial ass efficacy infuse intrathecal baclofen number neurovegetative episode seriously brain-injured patient . The secondary aim evaluate efficacy treatment hypertonia , assess change wake treatment safety . Study design . Double-blind randomized trial two parallel group . The second part study open label : group receive experimental treatment . Intervention Experimental group : continuous progressive dose intrathecal baclofen one week ; constant dose baclofen second week receives dose determine first week . Treatment stop two week , patient assess end third week . Control group : intrathecal placebo one week ; progressive dose intrathecal baclofen second week . Treatment stop two week , patient assess end third week . Outcomes . The main outcome number neurovegetative episode last 48 hour first week treatment . Secondary outcome hypertonia measure Ashworth scale D2 D5 three week . Waking assess WHIM scale D5 week . Adverse event assess throughout 3 week study . Eligibility criterion . Inclusion criterion focal diffuse encephalic lesion lead coma ( Glasgow score &lt; 8 ) , age 18 year , wake phase ( spontaneous eye-opening ) since least one month less six month , severe hypertonia low member ( mean Ashworth score &gt; = 3 ) neurovegetative episode ( least 10 48 hour ) and/or decortication failure treatment per o ( clonidine , beta-blocker , baclofen per o ) . Non inclusion criterion surgical , anesthetic allergic contraindication baclofen , uncontrolled sepsis directly threaten implant device associate medullary trauma . Expected result . Throughout trial patient hospitalize neurosurgical neurological intensive care department . Expected result clear decrease number neurovegetative episode substantial reduction hypertonia , least low limb . It also possible quantify consequence improvement wake .</detailed_description>
