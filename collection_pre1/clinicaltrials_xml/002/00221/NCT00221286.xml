	<brief_summary>The efficacy pegylated interferon treatment chronic hepatitis B show superior result standard care patient infect hepatitis B . The efficacy pegylated interferon treatment chronic hepatitis B HIV-coinfected patient know present . The purpose study evaluate efficacy pegylated interferon treatment chronic hepatitis B HIV-infected individual . Apart evaluate efficacy pegylated interferon therapy setting , i.e . patient without present future need highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) HIV-infection , second purpose study , investigate whether combination treatment HBV-infection may superior pegylated interferon therapy alone . Therefore patient without need HAART offer pegylated interferon alfa-2a 48 week . Patients require HAART offer emtricitabine / tenofovir DF contain HAART 72 week PLUS pegylated interferon alfa-2a 48 week vs. emtricitabine / tenofovir DF contain HAART 72 week WITHOUT pegylated interferon-alfa-2a .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety PegIFN +/- FTC / TDF Treat Chronic Hepatitis B HIV-Coinfected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even though generate data standard interferon treatment chronic HBV-infection HIV-coinfected patient appear promising moment , however treatment curative intention . Trials pegylated interferon treatment chronic HBV-infection monoinfected patient pegylated interferon show high efficacy standard care compare historic data higher efficacy compare non-pegylated interferon . This suggest parallel high efficacy treatment chronic hepatitis B HIV-coinfected well . At time , analysis suggest benefit pegylated interferon therapy prolong beyond 24 week 48 week elimination HBV-DNA serum appear continue beyond 24 week . Looking data chronic hepatitis C infection , well know elimination kinetics HCV-RNA HIV-coinfected patient slow compare HCV-monoinfected patient , clearly suggest rationale offer 48 week pegylated interferon treatment chronic hepatitis B HIV-coinfected patient well . Parallel say several factor suggest positive effect combination treatment nucleoside / nucleotide analogues active HBV interferon . Therefore patient need antiretroviral therapy CD4-cells 200/µl randomize either PegIFN part combination treatment FTC TDF FTC / TDF combination therapy alone . Patients receive HAART also receive third active antiretroviral HIV-drug , either non-nucleoside analogue ( NNRTI ) protease inhibitor ( PI ) , choice investigator . A non-divergent antiretroviral therapy solely base nucleoside analogue allow trial . The objective study ass efficacy ( HBV-DNA &lt; 5x10³ copies/ml , loss HBe-Ag , HBe-seroconversion ) safety ( adverse event , serious adverse event ) PegIFN 48 week , PegIFN 48 week plus TDF FTC contain HAART , TDF FTC contain HAART 72 week .</detailed_description>
