	<brief_title>`` Cuffed Versus Uncuffed Tracheal Tubes Small Children ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use cuff tracheal tube controversial topic paediatric anaesthesia intensive care medicine . Cuffed tube traditionally recommended child older 8 10 year . During past decade , however , several author argue use cuffed tracheal tube young child infant . A frequently cite argument use fear post-extubation morbidity , allegedly cause cuff induced tracheal laryngeal airway injury . Using modern improve design cuffed tracheal tube , data randomise prospective study , perform paediatric anaesthesia intensive care unit , suggest use cuffed tracheal tube carry increase risk airway morbidity compare uncuffed tracheal tube child 8 year age correctly use . However , study base single-centre experience and/or include neonate , infant small child . Hence , equipoise question , whether cuffed tube preferable uncuffed standard tube . So , randomize control multi-centre trial child birth &lt; 5 year age aim demonstrate equivalence major outcome post-extubation airway injury ( stridor ) compare uncuffed tracheal tube current tracheal tube modern high volume - low pressure cuff combine cuff pressure release valve . The primary hypothesis relate main outcome criterion study , post-extubation morbidity measure presence absence stridor tracheal extubation . The null-hypothesis Ho define difference incidence rate post-extubation morbidity cuffed uncuffed group . The null-hypothesis ( Ho : u-Diff = 0 ) compare alternative hypothesis ( H1 : u-Diff &lt; &gt; 0 ) . The study design detect clinically unacceptable deterioration 1.5 % baseline airway-injury rate 2.5 % use uncuffed tubes power 90 % type I error probability le 5 % .</detailed_description>
