	<brief_summary>This double blind , placebo-controlled study patient ≥65 year age undergoing surgery spine , hip knee replacement University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) Medical Center . Intraoperative anesthetic postoperative pain management standardize . Patients randomize receive either placebo gabapentin preoperatively , continue postoperatively discharge . Intraoperative anesthetic postoperative pain management strategy standardize . Postoperative delirium measure use structure interview . Cognitive function measure use battery neurocognitive test pre- post-operatively . Using intention treat strategy , , researcher UCSF , compare amount postoperative pain , narcotic requirement , postoperative delirium cognitive dysfunction two group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Gabapentin Improve Postoperative Pain Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative delirium common condition , occur 10-70 % surgical patient major surgery . To date , study examine event postoperative period contribute factor postoperative delirium . We recently complete study 500 geriatric surgical patient examine whether mode postoperative analgesia delivery , medication type , severity postoperative pain may impact occurrence postoperative delirium . In study , 46 % patient develop postoperative delirium either first second postoperative day . By multivariate logistic regression , variable independent association postoperative delirium include age ≥80 year , moderate severe preoperative resting pain , increase level rest pain postoperatively comparison preoperative baseline . When analysis focus patient use Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) alone postoperative pain control , amount narcotic use ( hydromorphone ) significantly higher postoperative delirium compare without , suggest inadequate pain control and/or central effect opioids may associate postoperative delirium . Since increase dos opioids elderly patient likely lead unwanted side effect respiratory depression , addition non-opioid agent may result narcotic-sparing effect , also reduce pain postoperatively . Gabapentin structural analog gamma-amino butyric acid , use anti-convulsant anti-nociceptive drug . It metabolize human ( therefore hepatic enzyme induction ) , eliminate body renal clearance . In animal study , gabapentin demonstrate effective reduce allodynia hyperalgesia , may selective effect nociceptive process involve central sensitization . Gabapentin successfully use treatment neuropathic pain painful condition . Recently , substantial evidence suggest gabapentin also may useful treatment postoperative pain . To date , nine randomize clinical trial gabapentin versus placebo include total 700 patient . Taken together , study report gabapentin give perioperatively significantly reduce postoperative analgesic requirement , minimum side effect . The reported significant side effect trial mild sedation two study . In patient epilepsy , gabapentin introduce therapeutic dos , present safety serious side effect issue . Since gabapentin negligible protein binding , interaction medication . It recommend metabolic laboratory monitoring necessary , excellent cognitive profile evident . At UCSF , gabapentin use safely relatively large number patient empiric base postoperative period , typically surgical patient substantial chronic pain , recently , patient undergo spinal surgery adjuvant agent narcotic relieve postoperative radicular pain ( personal communication Peter Koo , Clinical Pharmacist UCSF ) . Typically , patient start gabapentin 300 mg po TID first day , rapidly escalate 600 mg TID second day , finally 900 mg TID third day discharge . The UCSF experience suggest gabapentin well tolerate minimal side effect . Hypothesis We hypothesize intensive pain management postoperatively use adjuvant agent , gabapentin , lead decrease amount postoperative pain experience , thereby result decrease incidence postoperative delirium elderly patient undergo surgery spine . Aims 1 . To compare incidence postoperative delirium cognitive dysfunction placebo vs. gabapentin group 2 . To compare amount postoperative pain placebo vs. gabapentin group 3 . To compare amount narcotic use postoperatively placebo vs. gabapentin group Objectives 1 . The broad overall goal identify pathophysiology postoperative delirium cognitive dysfunction old patient 2 . To determine whether optimization postoperative pain control reduce incidence postoperative delirium cognitive dysfunction</detailed_description>
