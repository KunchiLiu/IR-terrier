	<brief_summary>The primary aim proposal conduct preliminary control trial valproate risperidone child age 3-7 yr. bipolar disorder . A secondary aim carefully characterize subject use clinical rating scale develop pilot data young cohort child bipolar disorder use support application NIMH prospective , longitudinal study provide important information course , medication response , neurobiology outcome patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Placebo Controlled Trial Valproate Risperidone Young Children With Bipolar Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It recognize pediatric bipolar disorder highly prevalent seriously disrupt life child adolescent , study show poor academic performance , disturb interpersonal relationship , increase rate substance abuse , legal difficulty , multiple hospitalization , increase rate suicide attempts completion ( Akiskal , Downs et al . 1985 ; Lewinsohn , Klein et al . 1995 ; Strober , Schmidt-Lackner et al . 1995 ) . We see increase number young child , age 3-7 year , either frank symptom BP I disorder . Over 50 % young patient first-degree relative bipolar disorder patient 's family significantly impact BP symptom . Many young BP patient treat stimulant antidepressant treat mood stabilize agent . Therefore , necessary provide control study psychotropics young bipolar population provide clinical practice appropriate evidence-base . Several major question exist young bipolar patient : - What response young bipolar patient mood stabilizer atypical antipsychotic ? - Will non-responders mono-therapy either valproate risperidone respond treatment agent ? - How best characterize patient clinically ? - What long-term outcome patient ? - Will earlier treatment lead well outcomes ? The clinical use mood stabilizer atypical antipsychotic agent child adolescent bipolar disorder increase significantly past year , despite fact limit research suggest agent effective population . Common clinical practice patient continue medication time follow remission , although length continuation treatment varies available guideline base consensus , control trial . The increased number medication prescribe led concern prescribe psychotropics child adolescent ( Zito , Safer et al . 2000 ; Zito , Safer et al . 2003 ) . Therefore , necessary provide additional controlled study mood stabilize agent young bipolar population guide clinical practice . There overwhelm need control trial various mood stabilizer atypical antipsychotic available use community young bipolar patient . Currently , experience valproate risperidone bipolar child , age 8 - 17 yr. base clinical experience , believe two agent safest likely efficacious child age 3-7 year . These agent widely use community control data desperately need regard effectiveness agent bipolar child , age 3-7 year . There specific behavioral treatment psychotherapy show efficacious patient . Power Analysis ( Provided Dr. Judy Bean ) Since preliminary study prior large control trial , percent responder receive one drug compare percent responder placebo arm . The child randomize achieve 24 total child drug arm 12 placebo arm . This 2:2:1 randomization scheme select expectation percent responder , drug arm , great percent placebo arm . The expectation 60 % child receive risperidone respond ( Frazier , Meyer et al . 1999 ) , compare 8 % placebo group ( Geller , Cooper et al . 1998 ) . Power calculate one-sided test since placebo well application make NIH . Using nQueryÂ® , version 5.0 , chi-square test , 0.05 significance level , 96 % power detect difference . For valproate , percent responder expect 55 % ( Kowatch , Suppes et al . 2000 ) , compare 8 % placebo arm . Again , use chi-square test .05 significance level , power 86 24 valproate arm 12 placebo arm . This pilot study power determine two drug arm equivalent .</detailed_description>
