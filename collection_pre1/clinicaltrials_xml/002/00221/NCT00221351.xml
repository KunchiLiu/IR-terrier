	<brief_summary>We aim evaluate impact CRP-guided management algorithm adult acute cough illness . More specifically , examine process care clinical outcome : 1 . Processes care ( i.e. , chest x-ray order , antibiotic treatment , length-of-time ED ) . We hypothesize CRP-guided management associate decrease antibiotic prescription acute cough illness 50 percent 30 percent . 2 . Clinical outcome ( i.e. , duration illness , return visit , return visit diagnosis pneumonia , hospitalization , subsequent antibiotic use , satisfaction care ) . We hypothesize difference proportion patient feel back normal within 2 week ED visit acute cough illness ( 60 percent , 95 % confidence interval=50 70 percent ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) -Guided Management Algorithm Adults With Acute Cough</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We develop CRP-guided management algorithm base recent study accuracy CRP identify patient pneumonia confirm . ( 10 ; 11 ) Importantly , 2 study confirm CRP level provide additional diagnostic support beyond gain application clinical prediction rule . In proposed study , recommend physician first assess probability pneumonia base clinical finding , accordance current practice recommendation follow : 1 ) Low Clinical Suspicion ( &lt; 5 % probability pneumonia ) : Absence fever ( T &gt; 38C ) , tachycardia ( HR &gt; 100 ) , tachypnea ( RR &gt; 24 ) , normal chest examination . These patient receive symptomatic therapy , require CXR antibiotic treatment ; 2 ) High Clinical Suspicion ( &gt; 30 % probability pneumonia ) : At least 1 abnormal vital sign abnormal chest examination . These patient receive CXR antibiotic base CXR finding high clinical suspicion ; 3 ) Intermediate Clinical Suspicion ( 5-30 % ) : All others . Current practice guideline recommend consider CXR patient , however guidance provide management patient . After assess clinical probability pneumonia , CRP level provide random subset patient . A CRP level &lt; 10 mg/L corresponds low probability bacterial pneumonia . Thus , patient low intermediate-probability pneumonia base clinical ground , CRP &lt; 10 mg/L confirm CXR antibiotic necessary routine case ( See attach algorithm ) . A CRP level &gt; 100 mg/L corresponds substantially elevate probability pneumonia . Thus , patient low intermediate-probability pneumonia base clinical ground , CRP &gt; 100 mg/L would support CXR ordering , patient high clinical suspicion , antibiotic therapy consider regardless CXR result ( since study show CXR miss 10 % community-acquired pneumonia confirm follow-up CXR chest compute tomography ) . Overall , addition CRP test result would reduce need CXR order antibiotic therapy case intermediate clinical probability pneumonia low CRP level ; increase need CXR order possibly antibiotic therapy case intermediate high clinical probability pneumonia high CRP level . In way , hypothesize CRP-guided management algorithm improve proportion patient acute cough illness receive appropriate diagnostic therapeutic intervention ED . We suspect patient clinically apparent pneumonia high CRP level . However , pneumonia difficult diagnosis make patient present atypical clinical manifestation ( e.g . elderly COPD patient ) , practice setting radiography readily available . In setting , addition CRP testing may help identify small number pneumonia case might otherwise go undetected result delay appropriate care . In large number patient intermediate probability pneumonia , adult acute cough illness abnormal vital sign , normal examination , particularly RSV influenza season , CRP level &lt; 10 mg/L could provide clinically significant reassurance refrain test empiric antibiotic treatment . A normal CRP level may also provide support clinician receive pressure patient prescribe antibiotic clinically indicate . Indirect future benefit society possible research result show CRP-guided management strategy decrease cost health care . Randomization use random number generator conduct investigator data coordinate center ( Philadelphia , PA ) , result place sequentially number study packet . The study personnel enroll patient blind randomization result patient provide informed consent participate study . Interventions - Staff Educational Seminar : Prior beginning study , staff inform performance characteristic CRP adult acute cough illness , current clinical practice recommendation regard evaluation treatment acute cough illness , particularly acute bronchitis . - CRP-Guided Algorithm : Study subject randomize CRP-guided management algorithm point-of-care CRP test perform shortly triage use finger-stick specimen . The result , along printed management algorithm interpret CRP level ( see Appendix ) , place chart . The general guideline interpret CRP level describe . Human Subjects Procedures - Recruitment Initial Contact Method . As described , appropriate patient refer study personnel triage nurse . Initial contact inform consent conduct discrete manner , private setting . - Informed consent . Will obtain study personnel train Human Subjects Protection . The time involve research subject obtain informed consent 10 minute . - CRP measurement . A finger-stick blood test perform use NycoCard II Reader ( Axis-Shield , Norway ) . See test instrument description Appendix . The US FDA approve diagnostic test kit one moderate complexity specific circumstance . The CRP test bill patient . The time involve research subject perform CRP test 10 minute . - Chart abstraction . The Chart Abstraction instrument resemble use baseline period ( 11/03-2/04 11/04-2/05 ) currently IRB-approved study follow modification , except also abstract finding physical examination portion medical record relate chest examination . - Telephone follow-up survey . Study subject contact telephone 2-4 week follow emergency department visit train research staff use telephone survey instrument use baseline period ( already approve ) . The time involve research subject complete telephone survey 10 minute .</detailed_description>
