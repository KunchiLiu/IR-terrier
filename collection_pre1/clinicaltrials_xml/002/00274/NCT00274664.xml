	<brief_summary>Amblyopia ( ‘ lazy eye ’ ) common visual disorder childhood cause interruption visual development . Occlusion good eye patch mainstay treatment , force use , affect eye . We little understanding much treatment require improvement , occlusion may continue many month . This demand child family whole . Treatment outcome frequently unsatisfactory . Compliance often poor , thus know precisely much treatment child actually receive much require . To overcome , design instrument permit u measure occlusion : occlusion dose monitor ( ODM ) provide objective record much occlusion child actually receive . Recently observe 75 % improvement induce occlusion occur first four week treatment . In study explore possibility intensive treatment period amblyopia therapy shorten – i.e . treatment efficient , effective , ‘ family-friendly ’ . The study hypothesis 12 hours/day patch effective 6 hours/day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The identification subsequent management amblyopia major consumer health service resource , within hospital sector account around 80-90 % visit child ’ eye service . Occlusion good eye mainstay treatment little understanding dose-response relationship may continue many month sometimes many hundred hour . This demand child family whole yet outcome frequently unsatisfactory . Currently , reliable data kinetics visual improvement , occlusion tends prescribe ad hoc basis . Recent pilot research show 75 % treatment-generated improvement occurs within first 4 week 6 hours/day occlusion prescribe . In study explore possibility intensive treatment period amblyopia therapy shorten – i.e . make efficient hopefully effective . The purpose present study , Randomized Occlusion Treatment Amblyopia Study ( ROTAS ) , compare two frequently employ patching regimen : ‘ substantial ’ ( 6 hrs/day ) ‘ maximal ’ ( 12 hrs/day ) patching . Our experimental design incorporate objective occlusion monitoring able discriminate beneficial effect refractive correction occlusion . The study comprise three phase : ‘ baseline ’ , ‘ refractive adaptation ’ ‘ occlusion. ’ Our aim provide guideline patient management base , first time , experimentally determine statistically verifiable relationship treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
