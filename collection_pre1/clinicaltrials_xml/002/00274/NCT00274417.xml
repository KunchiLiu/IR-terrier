	<brief_title>Dutasteride Improving Peri-Operative Long-Term Outcomes Photoselective Vaporization Prostate ( DOP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess effect dutasteride outcomes QoL patient undergo GreenLight Photoselective Vaporization Prostate . PVP grow , outpatient surgical treatment BPH . The addition dutasteride may potentially improve short long term outcome . Use peri-operatively may improve visibility surgery , shorten operative time , lessen bleed intra post-operatively hasten post-op recovery . Continued use long-term ( 12 month follow procedure ) may improve overall symptomatic score combination therapy PVP . The addition dutasteride PVP may decrease occasional occurrence continue post-op irritative symptom lessen likelihood need re-catheterization overall improvement quality life .</detailed_description>
