	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , arsenic trioxide gemtuzumab ozogamicin , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give arsenic trioxide together gemtuzumab ozogamicin work treat patient advanced myelodysplastic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Treating Patients With Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy arsenic trioxide gemtuzumab ozogamicin achieve complete partial remission patient advance myelodysplastic syndrome . Secondary - Determine efficacy regimen , term 50 % decrease Red Blood Cell ( RBC ) transfusion requirement change hemoglobin concentration baseline patient treat regimen . - Determine platelet , neutrophil , bone marrow , cytogenic response patient treat regimen . - Determine response duration patient treat regimen . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . - Determine safety toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label study . Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV 1 hour daily day 1-5 week 1 twice weekly week 2-12 . They also receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV 2 hour day 8 . Treatment repeat every 12 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , every 12 week study treatment , 4 week completion study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
