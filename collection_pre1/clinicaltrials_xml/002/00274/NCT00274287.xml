	<brief_title>GM-CSF Maintenance Prostate Cancer Patients Responding Taxotere</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treat single arm , open label trial primary end point meet , patient 's withdrawal , investigator 's discretion . After achieve maximal response taxotere chemo schedule eligible enroll trial begin treatment maintenance GMCSF 2 week follow 2 week rest . Once progression document patient take study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Men &gt; 18 year age . No upper age limit 2 . Written informed consent approve institutional review board explain sign patient 3 . Documentation histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . Gleason score sum allow study . 4 . Metastatic disease evidence visceral involvement , bone disease , PSA elevation . 5 . Patients meet criterion androgen independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) . Patients would fulfill criterion continue progress despite complete androgen blockade ( surgical medical castration antiandrogen ) despite antiandrogen withdrawal trial . Failing antiandrogen withdrawal define decline 25 % 3weeks stopping antiandrogens . Progression hormonal therapy define ANY follow : PSA : 2 consecutive rise PSA value , least 14days apart , &gt; 5 ng/ml For patient visceral measurable disease , progression define increase 50 % size measurable area , development new lesion . For patient boneonly disease , progression define appearance 2 new area abnormal uptake bone scan , compare prior image study . Changes uptake already exist lesion NOT use define progressive disease . For patient bone AND visceral disease , fulfil criterion 5.2 5.3 sufficient define progression . 6 . Castration level testosterone ( &lt; 50 ng/dl ) achieve via medical surgical castration . Patients continue LHRH agonist throughout method use achieve castration . 7 . Life expectancy least 6 month 8 . Adequate hematologic , renal , liver function evidence follow : WBC &gt; 2000 , ANC &gt; 1000 , Platelet count &gt; 100,000 , HgB &gt; 9.0 g/dl , Creatinine &lt; 2 , Total bilirubin &lt; 2x upper limit normal , AST ALT &lt; 3 x upper limit normal 9 . ECOG performance status 0 1 . 10 . The use intravenous polyphosphate bone metastasis allow . 11. upon completion taxotere portion study , patient enrol &amp; receive GMCSF ANY follow criterion meet : Patients receive total 8 cycle taxotere &amp; sign disease progression Patients achieve maximal response despite receive &lt; 8 cycle taxotere . Maximum response define drop measure PSA 10 % less 2 consecutive measurement . Patients complete chemotherapy &lt; 12 week prior open trial &amp; still stable disease without progression ( PSA radiographically ) eligible receive maintenance GMCSF 1. presence brain metastases 2 . Known HIV+ status 3 . ECOG performance status 2 high 4 . Use investigational agent within 4 week start 5 . Patients prior exposure one chemotherapy program Patients receive one chemotherapy schedule enrol study receive GMCSF ( maintenance arm ) last chemotherapy taxotere , give within past 12 week , demonstrate NO evidence progression radiographically biochemically . Prior exposure steroid NOT exclusion criterion . 6 . Patients active malignancy ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer ) exclude . Prior malignancy exclusion criterion long last treatment malignancy 5 year prior enrollment . 7 . Treatment investigational product NOT exclusion criterion , therapy last receive 4 week prior enrollment . 8 . Any medical intervention condition , opinion principle investigator , could compromise adherence study requirement .</criteria>
