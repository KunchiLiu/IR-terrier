	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , arsenic trioxide dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sometimes chemotherapy give , stop growth cancer cell . The cancer say resistant chemotherapy . Giving ascorbic acid may reduce drug resistance allow cancer cell kill . Thalidomide may stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . Giving arsenic trioxide together ascorbic acid , dexamethasone , thalidomide may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give arsenic trioxide together ascorbic acid , dexamethasone , thalidomide work treat patient chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis myelodysplastic myeloproliferative disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate efficacy ( term response rate ) arsenic trioxide , ascorbic acid , dexamethasone , thalidomide patient chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder . Secondary - Determine rate disease progression progression acute leukemia patient treat regimen . - Assess improvement bone marrow pathology ( include degree fibrosis , percentage blast , resolution cytogenetic abnormality ) patient treat regimen . - Determine time response patient treat regimen . - Determine reduction spleen size patient treat regimen . - Measure clinical response quality life subgroup treat regimen . - Determine safety regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV 1-2 hour 5 day oral ascorbic acid daily 5 day week 1 . Patients receive arsenic trioxide ascorbic acid twice week week 2-12 . Patients also receive oral dexamethasone daily 5 day week 1 , 5 , 9 , 12 oral thalidomide twice daily week 1-12 . Courses repeat every 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline every course . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
