	<brief_title>A Study Adalimumab Treat Sarcoidosis Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cutaneous lesion sarcoidosis often disfigure produce functional impairment . They tend hard treat topical therapy often require systemic medication carry risk significant side effect . Often treatments withheld unless need use visceral involvement . There thus unmet need safe effective treatment patient . In addition essentially control trial data treatment cutaneous sarcoidosis . This study intend determine adalimumab might offer viable therapeutic option condition compare response cutaneous sarcoid lesion drug compare placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject &gt; 18 year age . 2 . Subject must moderate severe cutaneous sarcoidosis chronic indurate lesion ( papule , nodule , and/or plaque ) , histopathologically show noncaseating granuloma negative special stain microorganism ( AFB PAS GMS ) . Accepted clinical variant include , necessarily limit follow : lupus pernio nodular subcutaneous annular angiolupoid plaque papular lichenoid psoriasiform 3 . For purpose study `` moderate severe cutaneous sarcoidosis '' define presence sarcoidal skin lesion follow feature : At least 5 easily visible facial lesion , Disease involve &gt; 3 % BSA , Disease confer functional impairment ( e.g . nasal visual field obstruction ) , Disease confer significant symptom itch and/or pain . 4 . If female , subject either childbearing potential , defined postmenopausal least 1 year surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy ) , use one follow method birth control duration study 90 day study completion : condom , sponge , foam , jelly , diaphragm , intrauterine device contraceptive ( oral parenteral ) three month prior study drug administration vasectomize sole partner 5 . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screen visit . 6 . Subject must history evidence tuberculosis , either active previously treat . This determination base negative PPD skin test negative chest radiograph screening , negative history previous tuberculosis , negative history previous exposure tuberculosis . 7 . Subject must willing able give inform consent comply requirement protocol . 8 . Subject must willing able selfadminister SC injection qualify person available administer SC injection . 9 . The following criterion concomitant treatment sarcoidosis must meet : Topical therapy ( corticosteroid ) must discontinue least 2 week prior baseline visit . Intralesional therapy ( corticosteroid ) must discontinue least 4 week prior baseline visit . Systemic therapy ( MTX , antimalarial , prednisone , immunosuppressant , thalidomide , tetracycline derivative ) must discontinue least 4 week prior baseline visit . OR subject topical oral medication , dose stable time interval likely remain stable duration study . Patients whose noncutaneous disease manage physician continue care direct physician . The manage physician keep informed patient ' status , consistent study blinding . If patient 's dose concomitant systemic therapy noncutaneous sarcoidosis must change 20 % dose study entry due change medical condition doubleblind phase , subject discontinue study . During openlabel phase need great 20 % increase dose concomitant treatment noncutaneous sarcoidosis view treatment failure patient discontinue study . Reduction dose treatment magnitude result discontinuance . Continued use intralesional therapy permit . Inhaled corticosteroid stable medical condition allow . 1 . Evidence active skin disease skin infection screen may interfere evaluation sarcoidosis . 2 . Subject know sensitivity component study medication . ( See Table 4 . ) 3 . Subject active infection require systemic antibiotic time screen . 4 . Subject history malignancy lymphoproliferative disease within past 5 year , exclude successfully treat nonmelanoma epithelial skin cancer and/or localize carcinoma situ cervix . 5 . Subject history congestive heart failure . 6 . Subject poorly control medical condition include , limited , unstable cardiovascular disease , poorly control diabetes , recent stroke , history recurrent infection , condition , opinion investigator , participation study would place subject risk . 7 . Subject history demyelinate CNS disease . 8 . Subject history listeriosis , treat untreated tuberculosis , exposure individual tuberculosis , persistent active infection require hospitalization treatment IV antibiotic , IV antiretrovirals , IV antifungal within 30 day baseline , OR oral antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal purpose treat infection , within 14 day baseline . 9 . Subject currently use plan use antiretroviral therapy time prior study . 10 . Previous use antiTNF agent ( ) . 11 . Receipt investigational product within 30 day prior first dose investigational product . 12 . Subject know immune deficiency immunocompromised . 13 . Female subject pregnant , breast feeding , consider become pregnant study within 150 day last dose study medication . 14 . Subject history clinically significant drug alcohol abuse last year . 15 . Subject consider investigator , reason , unsuitable candidate study participation . 16 . Clinically significant ECG abnormality screen visit . 17 . Hgb &lt; 8.5 g/dL female &lt; 9.0 male . 18 . WBC count &lt; 3000/mm2 19 . AST ALT &gt; 2.0 time upper limit normal age range , confirm repeat measure . 20 . Bilirubin &gt; 3mg/dL 21 . Creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL woman , &gt; 1.8 mg/dL men . 22 . Subject plan receive live vaccine study . 23 . Subject variant sarcoidosis amenable study evaluation , absence chronic indurate lesion , : Acute , `` benign '' sarcoid associate erythema nodosum Acute iritis Ichthyosiform sarcoidosis Hypo hyperpigmented macular sarcoidosis Ulcerative sarcoidosis Erythroderma Alopecia</criteria>
