	<brief_summary>Allomatrix combination Demineralized Bone Matrix bind medium calcium sulfate hemihydrate carboxymethylcellulose . Allomatrix combine osteoinductive capacity DBM osteoconduction control resorption surgical grade calcium sulfate . Unstable fracture distal radius resist displacement manipulate anatomical position . There parallel quality anatomic result residual capacity wrist , except old , low demand patient . Injectable osteoconductive cement introduce fill void metaphyseal bone may provide good stability around hardware osteoporotic bone help maintain reduction fracture fragments.Moreover , product like ALLOMATRIX could accelerate improve bone heal fracture stability osteoinductive property . However , clinical significance new bone graft material still proven randomise control study set-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN The study design randomise , prospective , study concurrent control . A total 50 patient enrol one centre randomise two group . One group patient ( comprise 50 % study population ) ALLOMATRIX Injectable Putty implant . In control group patient ( comprise 50 % study population well ) graft material use . Patients randomly assign one two treatment arm . Sequentially numbered randomisation envelope provide . Once surgical reduction stabilisation complete , next sequentially numbered randomisation envelope open patient receive treatment list within envelope . Each envelope contain one treatment arm base computer generate randomised schedule . DURATION AND ENDPOINTS OF THE STUDY The enrollment period expect 3 year . Patients follow pre-operative visit one-year visit . Study End Points : - Comparison time heal fracture - Comparison function operate wrist - Radiographic densitometric assessment bone regeneration - Failure rate ( Non-union , malunion , fracture instability , wrist stiffness ) - Complication rate ( infection , drainage , hardware failure , wound dehiscence ) - Bone growth factor ( blood sample forearm 3 week surgery ) PATIENT SELECTION The study direct unstable distal radius fracture among type I , III V , accord classification Fernandez ( 4 ) . It decide follow group young patient outcome old , low demand patient significantly dependent precise reduction contrary outcome younger , high demand patient ( 15 ) . STUDY : PRACTICAL INFORMATION 1 . For patient present candidate study , inclusion exclusion criterion review . After informed consent , pre-operative data collect ( see case report form ) regular pre-operative data collect plan operation . The patient usually operate within one week injury distal radius fracture . 2 . The treatment protocol distal radius fracture rely decision scheme developped Fernandez Wolfe ( 21 ) . We favor percutaneous stabilisation open reduction internal fixation . No significant clinical difference note two technique unstable fracture ( 22 ) . The surgical procedure conduct brachial plexus anesthesia.For type I III ( 4 ) , fracture reduce manually image intensifier control . One two Kirshner wire ( 1.5mm ) direct tip radial styloid dorsally first extensor compartment angle approximately 45 degree cross fracture enter dorsoulnar cortex radius proximally fracture . These wire place use power drill . An additional wire place fracture fragment , insert dorsoulnar corner radius fourth fifth extensor compartment direct dorsoulnarly towards palmar radially distal proximal direction.6 The tip wire bent leave outside skin , necessary resorbable suture ( Vicryl 3/0 ) use . For type III fracture ( 4 ) , external fixator bridge joint completes usually procedure . The criterion reduction3 ulnar inclination 22° , palmar inclination 11° , neutral ulnar variance radial width ( distance lateral tip radial styloid process longitudinal axis center radius AP film ) . A radioscopic image contralateral wrist take operating room serve control , prosupination condition , standardize radiology department ( 19,20 ) . The angle measure preoperatively appropriate software ( OEC radioscopy ) control postoperatively radioscopy software . At end surgical reduction stabilization fracture , sequentially numbered randomization envelope open patient receive treatment list within envelope : either ALLOMATRIX Injectable Putty additional graft .</detailed_description>
