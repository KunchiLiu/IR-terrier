	<brief_summary>This phase 1 , open-label , multicenter study investigate use MLN518 combination standard chemotherapy patient newly diagnose AML . Two dose level MLN518â€”200 mg 400 mg give orally twice day plan sequential evaluation separate group patient . Patients assign 400 mg dose level give orally twice day MLN518 , potentially dose MLN518 adjust basis MLN518 plasma concentration measure first 3 day induction therapy . All patient receive initial induction chemotherapy cytarabine , 200 mg/m2/day CIVI Days 1 7 , daunorubicin , 60 mg/m2/day intravenous ( IV ) push ( IV infusion borderline cardiac function detect ) Days 1 3 ( `` 7+3 '' ) . An abbreviated cytarabine daunorubicin regimen ( `` 5+2 '' ) also use initial remission induction therapy fail clear bone marrow blast cell ( typically detect Day 15 bone marrow ) second attempt remission induction indicate . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) receive consolidation therapy HiDAC ( standard modify ) combination continue MLN518 treatment . Patients remain continuous CR completion last cycle consolidation therapy permit continue treatment single-agent MLN518 6 month thereafter .</brief_summary>
