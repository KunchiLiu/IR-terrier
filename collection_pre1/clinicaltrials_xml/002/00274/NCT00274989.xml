	<brief_summary>CLL2M phase 2 , multicenter , open label study investigate possible therapeutic benefit use bendamustine combination rituximab treatment patient previously untreated relapsed CLL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine Rituximab Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional chemotherapy also high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation curative treatment option B-CLL ; nearly patient eventually relapse . Also monoclonal antibody curative B-CLL patient monotherapy , impact survival combination conventional chemotherapy currently validate . In addition , standard combination therapy patient relapse CLL . Therefore urgent medical need identify new strategy . The combination rituximab ( monoclonal antibody ) bendamustine ( chemotherapy ) show encouraging activity patient relapsed/refractory NHL mantle cell lymphoma . In vitro study use investigate effect bendamustine rituximab program cell death ( apoptosis ) show synergistic effect drug . The mechanisms action two active drug may provide treatment good therapeutic potential CLL . However , though bendamustine use 30 year still need define standard regimen use bendamustine combination monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) especially treatment CLL .</detailed_description>
