	<detailed_description>Anticholinergic drug currently indicate severity COPD , due dominance cholinergic tone pathological process disease . SPIRIVA new long act anticholinergic , show benefit improve lung function , dyspnoea , health status le exacerbation compare ipratropium , salmeterol placebo secondary care ( hospital setting ) . The study determine effect see lung function dyspnoea either SPIRIVA placebo add usual therapy /care COPD patient naïve anticholinergic agent manage primary care . The one year placebo active control study confirm efficacy safety . No evidence tolerance bronchodilator effect tiotropium see . Consistent improvement health outcome also demonstrate . In one-year study , statistically significantly few patient tiotropium group experience exacerbation , hospitalise exacerbation . Additionally , time first exacerbation increase . This suggest moderate severe exacerbation reduce in-patients treated tiotropium . The mechanism underlie know , may associate sustain airway open . The study involve five visit GP surgery period 14 week . Patient attend initial visit study information give obtain write consent . At subsequent screen visit physical examination include ECG together assessment lung function perform . Once eligibility study confirm , completion 14 day 'run-in ' period , patient start treatment daily inhalation HandiHaler device either SPIRIVA placebo , addition usual COPD therapy . Throughout 12 week treatment period , patient require inhale study treatment medication ( morning ) complete diary card . Patients required return surgery 2 6 week , final visit 12 week lung function testing , assessment symptom use Oxygen Cost Diagram ( OCD ) , Health Resources Utilisation ( HRU ) adverse event . On completion 12 week treatment period , full physical examination repeat . Adverse event monitor include COPD exacerbation take place throughout study . Study Hypothesis : Based previous study COPD patient long act beta agonist ( LABAs ) , standard deviation ( SD ) trough FEV1 215 ml effect 130 ml see mean trough FEV1 tiotropium . It assume 20 % primary care manage COPD patient use LABAs part usual care . The effect tiotropium mean trough FEV1 study population expect low 130 ml see previous study . Placebo expect effect mean trough FEV1 . Assuming SD 235ml , total 348 patient ( 174 per group ) adequate detect difference 100 ml mean trough FEV1 response treatment least 95 % power 2.5 % level significance ( one-sided ) use two group t-test . To consider complete , patient must complete primary efficacy data study visit specify protocol without violation protocol significant obscure response treatment .

	<criteria>Prior participation study patient must sign date inform consent consistent ICHGCP guideline . Male female patient 40 year age old . Patients diagnosis COPD accord BTS criteria..A stable disease state airway obstruction FEV1 30 65 % predict normal value FEV1 /FVC &lt; 70 % pre bronchodilator . Predicted normal value calculate accord ECCS : For height measure metre Males : FEV1 predict ( L ) = 4.30 X ( Ht mt ) 0.029 X ( Age yrs ) 2.49 Females : FEV1 predict ( L ) = 3.95 X ( Ht mt ) 0.025 X ( Age yrs ) 2.60 For height measure inch Males : FEV1 predict ( L ) = 4.30 X ( Ht inches/39.37 ) 0.029 X ( Age yrs ) 2.49 Females : FEV1 predict ( L ) = 3.95 X ( Ht inches/39.37 ) 0.025 X ( Age yrs ) 2.60 Maintained stable respiratory medication 4 week prior visit 1 ( change respiratory medication oral dosage ) . Currently take salbutamol terbutaline MDI DPI . Patient must able inhale medication HandiHaler ? Patients must able perform technically acceptable pulmonary function test accordance ATS criterion must able maintain record ( Patient Daily Record ) study period require protocol . Patients must current exsmokers smoke history 10 pack year . Pack Years = Number cigarettes/day 20 ( Patients never smoke cigarette must exclude . ) NOTE : An exacerbation COPD require treatment occur within four week period prior screen visit 1 mean screening postpone least four week . Therefore , patient duration least 4 week free exacerbation . Patients significant disease , COPD exclude . A significant disease define disease opinion investigator may either put patient risk participation study disease may influence result study patient 's ability participate study . Patients take inhaled anticholinergic previous 12 month . Patients treat inhaled anticholinergic ( via nebuliser meter dose inhaler ) due exacerbation time period longer 7 day may include . Patients upper respiratory tract infection exacerbation COPD require treatment four week prior screen visit ( visit 1 ) twoweek runin period . Patients recent history ( i.e. , six month less ) myocardial infarction . Any unstable life threaten cardiac arrhythmia require intervention change drug therapy within last year . Patients know active tuberculosis . Patients history thoracotomy pulmonary resection plan lung transplantation lung volume reduction surgery . Patients history asthma , cystic fibrosis , bronchiectasis , interstitial lung disease pulmonary thromboembolic disease . Patients treated antihistamine ( H1 receptor antagonist ) asthma exclude allergic condition . Patients history cancer last five year ; Basal cell tumour patient whose length time remission great five year include . Patient known hypersensitivity atropine , anticholinergic drug lactose previous adverse reaction anticholinergic drug result withdrawal anticholinergic compound . Patients use oral corticosteroid medication unstable dos ( i.e . Patients stable dose less 6 week prior randomisation ) dose excess equivalent 10mg</criteria>
