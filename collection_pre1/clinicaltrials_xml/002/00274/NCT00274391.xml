	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether combination inhale amiloride concentrated salt solution well salt solution cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patient . In CF , airway secretion thick dehydrate . Many patient use inhaled salt solution help draw water secretion easier get rid chest physiotherapy ( “ chest PT ” ) cough . Unfortunately , salt solution reabsorb quickly airway , beneficial effect may last long . In hope prolong effect , drug amiloride could use combination slow salt water reabsorption airway . Amiloride medication give mouth high blood pressure many year . It possible combination salt solution inhale amiloride may significantly improve clearance secretion CF , would expect improve lung function CF .</brief_summary>
