	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether continuous infusion Blinatumomab ( MT103 ) safe treatment relapse Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma . Furthermore , study intend provide pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic data Blinatumomab well get first indication tumour activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Bispecific T-cell Engager Blinatumomab ( MT103 ) Patients With Relapsed NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) represent 6th common cancer . Globally , around 165,000 new case diagnose year , approximately 90,000 death per year . The vast majority NHLs B-cell derive ( 90 % ) express common B-cell antigen CD19 , CD20 CD22 . NHL divide indolent ( low-grade ) aggressive ( high-grade ) lymphoma . Still almost patient advanced stage indolent disease die disease . Therefore , high medical need exists develop novel agent improve survival NHL patient . Blinatumomab ( MT103 ) bispecific antibody derivative , anti-CD19 x anti-CD3 , design link B-cells T-cells result T-cell activation cytotoxic T-cell response CD19+ cell . Data prior phase I study show evidence biological activity human . In vitro ex-vivo data suggest longterm presence drug target tissue may provide antitumour activity . The study investigate safety tolerability different dos Blinatumomab administration continuous infusion regimen . Maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define classical 3+3 dose escalation regimen .</detailed_description>
