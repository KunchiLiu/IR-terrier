	<brief_title>Mechanisms Dyspnea Relief During Exercise COPD Patients Following Treatment With Tiotropium ( Spiriva )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over study . The duration subject participation 9 week . There initial screening period 2 week . The first screening visit consist medical history , clinical assessment , chronic dyspnea evaluation , complete pulmonary function test , symptom-limited maximal incremental cycle exercise test . A second visit screen period intend training subject procedure perform study , specific focus familiarisation constant work rate exercise test . The screening period follow 2 x 7 day treatment period ( 1 x tiotropium 1 x placebo ) , separate 4 week washout period . On last day treatment period , subject visit clinic complete series trial related procedure , include lung function measurement constant work rate exercise test 75 % Wcap symptom limitation . Testing consist pulmonary function testing , dyspnea evaluation , symptom-limited constant-load cycle exercise test measurement cardiopulmonary parameter , symptom intensity pulmonary mechanic . \ Study Hypothesis : Dynamic hyperinflation restrict volume expansion exercise suspect primary mechanism dyspnea . The dissociation drive muscular effort breathe mechanical response increase volume ( reflect increase Pes/PImax : VT/predicted VC ratio ) correlate well intensity inspiratory difficulty exercise COPD . It hypothesise reduce Borg rating standardize exercise level tiotropium would correlate strongly reduce restricted volume expansion exercise ( i.e. , increased VT/IC EILV/TLC ratio , decrease IC IRV ) . In word , dyspnea predominant qualitative dimension ( i.e. , inspiratory difficulty ) result patient force DH breathe high lung volume , predict TLC . Comparison ( ) : tiotropium bromide ( Spiriva ) vs. placebo</detailed_description>
