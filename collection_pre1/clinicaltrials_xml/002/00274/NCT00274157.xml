	<brief_summary>The specific aim project follow : To determine whether catheter-based revascularization procedure improve functional capacity quality life among patient intermittent claudication . To investigate whether improvement walk ability result le sedentary lifestyle improvement cardiovascular risk profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FIRE-PAD : Functional Improvement Through Revascularization Extremities Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients intermittent claudication decrease functional ability impair quality life [ QOL ] . In addition , peripheral arterial disease associate increase risk life threaten cardiovascular event . Due advance endovascular technology , peripheral revascularization procedure offer grow number patient lifestyle limit claudication , rather solely treatment critical limb ischemia . Indeed , accord data derive National Health Discharge Survey , 979 % increase number catheter-based revascularization procedure perform period 1995-2000 . Despite well define patency outcome , functional QOL benefit catheter-based revascularization procedure largely undefined . In addition improve leg symptom QOL , increase walk ability among patient claudication may lead less sedentary lifestyle improvement cardiovascular risk factor profile . However , relationship yet demonstrate . The propose project longitudinal cohort study follow patient intermittent claudication one year catheter-based revascularization procedure measure change functional capacity , QOL , cardiovascular risk factor . Patients evaluate baseline 3 12 month follow procedure . A total 60 patient studied three-year period . Functional parameter assess include treadmill walk distance , 6-minute walk test , walk velocity , self-assessed walking ability determine Walking Impairment Questionnaire . Activity level daily life assess use vertical accelerometer device , worn patient 7-day period time point . Quality life assess Short Form-36 Questionnaire Geriatric Depression Scale . Cardiovascular risk factor measure include anthropomorphic parameter , blood pressure , lipid , marker inflammation , homocysteine , insulin-sensitivity . It intend data generate study provide initial data plan multi-centered randomized clinical trial best medical therapy exercise training versus catheter-based revascularization treatment lifestyle limit claudication .</detailed_description>
