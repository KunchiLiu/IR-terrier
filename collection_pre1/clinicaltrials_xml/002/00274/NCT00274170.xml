	<brief_summary>: Headaches common complaint present emergency department ( ED ) , account 1-2 % ED visit , migraine second common primary headache syndrome . Patients ultimately present ED fail outpatient therapy exhibit severe persistent symptom . Treatment option traditionally parenteral opiod , generally Demerol . Unfortunately , patient chronic painful condition like migraine prone dependency . In 1986 , nonopioid , compazine note serendipitously relieve migraine headache pain . 1 Nonopioid regimen evolve standard therapy treatment migrainne headache ED . Today , number nonopioid treatment option , without individual concern . Ergotamine dihydroergotamine effective , commonly cause nausea vomiting . Sumatriptan expensive recurrence rate , ineffective 20-30 % , contra-indicated patient cardiac disease . Metoclopramide , dopamine receptor antagonist , commonly use anti-emetic agent , widely study use acute migraine . Its side effect include drowsiness dystonic reaction . Compazine successfully use treat migraine headache past several decade , accepted standard treatment headache ED . 2 Its side effect profile include extrapyramidal effect , dysphoria , drowsiness akathisias . The ideal medication treat headache would addictive property , side effect , quick onset , highly effective low rate recurrence . Somatostatin known inhibitory effect number neuropetides , implicate migraine . Native somatostatin unstable compound broken minute , octreotide , somatostatin analogue longer half life . Intravenous somatostatin show effective ergotamine acute treatment cluster headache . 3 The analgesic effect octreotide headache associate growth hormone secrete tumor establish . 4 Five somatostatin receptor clone octreotide act predominantely sst2 sst5 . The distribution sst2 within central nervous system strongly suggest particular somatostatin receptor role cranial nociception , highly express trigeminal nucleus caudalis periaqueductal grey . Kapicioglu et.al perform double blind study compare octreotide placebo treat migraine . They find significantly great relief pain octreotide 2 6 hour compare placebo ( 76 % vs 25 % , p &lt; 0.02 ) . They note 47 % octreotide group complete relief compare patient placebo group . They go note patient octreotide group earlier relief symptom side effect . The minor adverse event relate administration octreotide local reaction 3 patient ( 18 % ) . In study perform recently Netherlands , clinically relevant change vital sign , routine chemistry , urinalysis observe octreotide use . Electrocardiogram analyse show newly occur worsen know cardiac abnormality 2 24 h injection octreotide . 5 Levy et . al also compare octreotide placebo double blind study find difference . This poorly design study , patient treat home injection either placebo octreotide 2 episode headache record level pain relief 2 hour . Matharu et . al also perform double blind study compare octreotide placebo , look cluster headache rather migraine . They find significant improvement use octreotide placebo ( 52 % vs 36 % ) . At Darnall Army Community Hospital cost 100 mcg Octreotide and10 mg Compazine , $ 10.46 , $ 2.02-8.00 , respectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Evaluation Octreotide Versus Compazine Emergency Department Treatment Migraine Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A urine pregnancy test perform woman child bear age . After informed consent obtain , patient place dark private room ask grade nausea , pain , sedation 10 cm visual analog scale , use left end zero point complaint measurement . Patients instruct score zero signifies pain score 10 indicates severe pain . Each patient monitor continous pulse oximetry 20-gauge IV catheter place antecubital fossa . Based computer generate random table , subject receive one following : 2 cc contain 100ug octreotide , 10 mg compazine 2 minute period , follow 5 cc flush saline solution . The medication dose choose base previous literature . 6-8 Vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate ) record 0 , 30 , 60 minute . At 60 minute study injection , patient ask regrade nausea , pain ( VAS ) , sedation scale without view initial score . Clinically important successful treatment define achievement follow criterion : patient satisfaction either decrease 50 % pain score ( compare initial score ) absolute pain score 2.5 cm less . Failure achieve criterion constitute treatment failure . The treat physician use acceptable rescue medicine group medicine treatment failure . The 60 minute outcome select route chosen ( maximal absorption distribution within minute ) previous publish data suggest responder identify interval . 9 Each patient contact within 48 hour discharge define early relapse rate . 4.8 Inclusion criterion : Adults age 18 65 year age diagnosis migraine without aura meet criterion International Headache Society , least one prior episode similar headache . 10 The International Headache Society diagnosis criterion migraine without aura outline table : Migraine AuraØ At least two attack fulfil characteristicsØ Headache least three follow four characteristics:1 . 0ne fully reversible aura symptom indicate focal cerebral cortical and/or brain stem dysfunction2 . At least one aura symptom develop gradually 4 minute , tow symptom occur succession3 . No aura symptom last 60 minute ; one aura symptom present , accept duration proportionally increased4 . Headache follow aura free interval le 60 minute ( may also begin simultaneously aura ) Migraine without AuraØ At least 5 attack fulfil characteristicsØ Headache attack last 4-72 hour ( untreated unsuccessfully treat ) Ø Headache least two follow four characteristics:1 . Unilateral location 2 . Pulsating quality 3 . Moderate severe intensity inhibits prohibits daily activity 4 . Aggravated walk stair similar routine physical activityØ During headache least one two follow symptom occur:1 . Nausea and/or vomiting2 . Photophobia phonophobia 4.9 Exclusion criterion : pregnancy lactation , pre-medication within six hour enrol study , six prior headache per month , allergy study drug , non-migraine headache , substance abuse , alcohol abuse , diabetes mellitus , coexist condition might expose patient disproportionately increase risk significant adverse event : ischaemic heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure &gt; 160/95 ) , epilepsy , use cimetidine , dopamine agonist , cyclopsorin , oral hypoglycemic agent , hepatic renal failure , thyroid disorder . 4.10 Number Subjects : TOTAL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS ( nation-wide/study-wide ) 56 5.0 Human Subject Protection 5.1 Recruitment : Patients present DACH ER complaint headache interview physician . If meet inclusion exclusion criterion , inform study treat physician , opportunity ask question , read consent form . 5.2 Benefits : Patients participate study potential benefit headache pain resolve . They part effort find treatment migraine headache hopefully effective low side effect profile . 5.3 Risks : The risk study include treatment failure allergic reaction one study medicine . Each medicine care specific risk patient due unique make-up mechanism action . Octreotide show inhibit gallbladder contractility decrease bile secretion normal volunteer . In clinical trial , incidence biliary tract abnormalities 63 % ( 27 % gallstone , 24 % sludge without stone , 12 % biliary duct dilatation ) . Less 2 % patient treat octreotide 1 month less developed gallstone . Octreotide alters balance counter-regulatory hormone , insulin , glucagon growth hormone , may result hypoglycemia ( 3 % ) hyperglycemia ( 16 % ) . Studies also demonstrate octreotide suppress thyroid stimulate hormone ( 12 % ) . Pancreatitis , bradycardia , poor dietary fat B12 absorption also report . Most report patient acromegaly prone mention problem true incidence non-acromegaly population know . Compazine show cause orthostatic hypotension extrapyramidal symptom . Of extrapyramidal symptom , akathisia ( 25-60 % single dose ) dystonic reaction ( 4 % single dose ) commonly encounter . These reaction minimize rate administration concurrent use diphenhydramine . Due study design , diphenhydramine use slow rate administration 50 ml normal saline bag give 5 minute . This slow rate administration decrease risk extrapyramidal symptom . Irreversible tardive dyskinesia neuroleptic malignant syndrome describe compazine . These complication extremely rare true incidence unknown 5.4 Safeguards Protecting Subjects : Data collection sheet available treat physician PI . The PI AIs obtain follow information participant . Adverse reaction medication manage emergency department depend specific reaction . 5.5 Risk : Benefit Assessment : The medication use study currently use treat headache . Octreotide study set side effect profile minimal . The risk minimal current exclusion criterion . Benefit relief headache outweigh risk side effect one medication . 5.6 Alternatives : Other medication use treat migraine include morphine , reglan , magnesium . Alternative also participate study . 6.0 Data Analysis : In study , independent variable treatment ( octreotide , comparzine , demerol ) time ( 0 , 30 , 60 minute ) . The dependent variable pain measure numerical rating scale ( 1 10 ) . The null hypothesis difference pain treatment . The alternative hypothesis great decrease pain octreotide . The investigator expect pain baseline 6 +/- 2 . A 30 % difference pain treatment clinically significant . This 0.3 * 6 / 2 = 0.9 effect size . The appropriate test two-factor ANOVA ( treatment , time ) repeat measure one factor ( time ) follow one-tailed t-tests correct multiple comparison . Six post hoc comparison one-tailed test appropriate design , make maximum Bonferroni correction p = 0.05 / 6 = 0.0083 ~ 0.005 . I use look-up table base employ method Kraemer Thiemann ( 1988 ) obtain initial estimate sample size , confirm 1000 iteration Monte Carlo simulation power 80 % 85 % level confidence 95 % . According method , sample size 32 per group ( 96 total ) need detect clinically significant difference desire level confidence power . If two treatment ( octreotide , comparzine ) use , sample size 28 per group ( 56 total ) need .</detailed_description>
