	<detailed_description>Patients receive one current standard care regimens treatment HIV infection , i.e . nevirapine ( Viramune® ) must administer conjunction 2NRTIs , prescribe investigator study site . Patients randomized nevirapine ( Viramune® ) -arm study receive 1x200mg tablet daily first 14 day ( `` lead '' period ) 1x200 mg tablet twice daily appropriately spaced interval subsequently , plus SOC combination 2NRTIs prescribed investigator ( without change prior NRTIs ) . Patients randomize continue standard treatment receive prescribed investigator . No dose modification study drug permit trial . The study drug dispense randomization every four week thereafter completion 48 week . After 6 month least treatment switch PI regimen NVP regimen allow patient include PI arm accord patient 's willingness . In patient AST ALT check time 0 ( switch ) every 2 week 2 month . Study Hypothesis : Between treatment comparison Nevirapine-based regimen versus PI-based regimen base null hypothesis treatment difference . The null hypothesis difference two arm week 24 ( month 6th ) , alternative hypothesis mean change physical domain QoL 10 point score ( SD=20 ) difference triglyceride normalize patient 20 % . Comparison ( ) : The primary analysis physical domain QoL perform change last observation carry forward follow LCOF approach ( i.e . visit 6 case premature discontinuation visit 5 4 ) baseline ( visit 2 ) value use fixed-effects ANCOVA model center treatment group factor baseline value MMA type interaction also include main model .</detailed_description>
