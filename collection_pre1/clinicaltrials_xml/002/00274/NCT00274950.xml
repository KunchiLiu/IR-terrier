	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sometimes , surgery , tumor may need additional treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may kill remain tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase III trial study well observation and/or combination chemotherapy work surgery biopsy treat young patient extracranial germ cell tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Stratify reduce treatment pediatric patient extracranial germ cell tumor maintain event-free survival . - Treat newly diagnose patient extracranial germ cell tumor require chemotherapy carboplatin-based strategy . - Develop common strategy treatment patient recurrent progressive extracranial germ cell tumor . - Register case mature immature teratoma . - Develop common strategy management immature mature teratoma , include follow-up strategy permit early detection yolk sac recurrence . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients prior biopsy surgical resection undergo biopsy ( feasible ) surgical resection . Patients mature immature teratoma undergo observation . These patient relapse ( i.e. , tumor regrowth ) may undergo surgical resection unless tumor marker significantly elevate . If tumor marker significantly elevate , patient proceed JEB chemotherapy accord risk group . Patients malignant germ cell tumor assign 1 3 treatment group accord risk . - Low-risk group : Patients normal tumor marker undergo observation . Patients rise tumor marker AND imageable tumor proceed treatment intermediate-risk group . Patients rise tumor marker AND/OR imageable tumor consider relapsed proceed treatment intermediate- high-risk group . - Intermediate-risk group : Patients receive JEB chemotherapy comprise etoposide IV 4 hour day 1-3 , carboplatin IV 1 hour day 2 , bleomycin IV 30 minute day 3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . Patients residual tumor completion chemotherapy may undergo second-look surgery . - High-risk group : Patients receive JEB chemotherapy intermediate-risk group 6 course . Patients residual tumor completion chemotherapy may undergo second-look surgery . - Relapse therapy : Patients intermediate- high-risk group relapse completion JEB chemotherapy receive vinblastine IV day 1 2 , ifosfamide IV 1 hour day 1-5 , cisplatin IV day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 105 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
