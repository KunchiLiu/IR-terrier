	<detailed_description>Eligible thirty subject randomize double blind fashion either Rosiglitazone 4mg pill twice day versus placebo six week . Then six week period , group treat 48 week standard therapy hepatitis C consist Pegasys 180mcq weekly injection Ribavirin 1,000mg-1,200mg daily depend subject weight le 75 kg receive low dosage . In addition , subject continue Rosiglitazone placebo 48 week . The subject monitor side-effects history take blood test predetermine time period study . If viral load drop two log week 12 standard therapy hepatitis C therapy stop subject consider treatment failure . Similarly , great two log drop viral load week 12 still virus present blood week 24 therapy stop subject consider treatment failure . If virus undetectable blood week 12 24 therapy continue full 48 week . If virus detectable week 48 subject consider treatment failure . After 48 week treatment period virus still undetectable , follow-up period consist 24 week therapy . At end 24 week , blood test virus virus present subject sustain viral response treatment success .
