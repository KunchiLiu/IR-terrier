	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving celecoxib radiation therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell remain radiation therapy chemotherapy . Sometimes , radiation therapy chemotherapy , tumor may need additional treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study celecoxib see well work compare observation treat patient undergone radiation therapy chemotherapy stage II stage III non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Observation After Radiation Therapy Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage II Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare time progression patient stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treat celecoxib vs observation treatment chemoradiotherapy . Secondary - Compare 2-year survival rate patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare weight change objective response patient treat regimen . - Compare tolerability regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , ECOG performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) , total dose radiotherapy ( 65 Gy v 60 Gy ) . All patient undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 7.5 week . Patients also receive docetaxel IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Three week completion radiotherapy , patient receive docetaxel alone IV 30 minute day 1 22 . Three week later , patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients observe every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 1 year . - Arm II : Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
