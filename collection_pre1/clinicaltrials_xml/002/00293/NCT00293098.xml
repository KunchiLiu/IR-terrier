	<brief_summary>Patients iron overload due chronic blood transfusion develop heart failure high risk heart failure high level iron heart , treat deferiprone , investigational drug , combination deferoxamine ( Desferal ) . Some study suggest deferiprone may better deferoxamine remove iron heart improve heart function , use drug together may remove iron . Participants would make clinic visit lab study week , would continue take deferiprone long physician feel useful care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Repeated red cell transfusion lead transfusional iron overload body lack efficient mechanism excrete excess iron . Without treatment , iron accumulates liver , heart endocrine gland . Cardiac complication include arrhythmias congestive heart failure common cause death transfusional iron overload . New magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) T2* technique enable estimation cardiac iron loading , allow patient high risk cardiac disease ( T2* &lt; 10 m ) identify . For 30 year , deferoxamine standard therapy . However , mode administration cumbersome ( subcutaneous intravenous infusion 8 12 hour daily ) , lead poor compliance . Thus , cardiac disease early mortality continue significant problem patient treat chronic transfusion . Treatment cardiac complication involve intensify therapy deferoxamine , include recommend intravenous administration period 24 hour daily . Deferiprone oral chelating agent , FDA approve use United States . Recent study indicate deferiprone superior deferoxamine remove cardiac iron reduce iron-induced cardiotoxicity . The serious side effect deferiprone agranulocytosis , side effect gastrointestinal symptom , reversible arthralgia , reddish discoloration urine rare case autoimmune disease . Patients study closely monitored toxicity . Patients currently regularly follow The Children 's Hospital Philadelphia prescribe deferiprone 75 mg/kg/day three divide dos , take orally , combination deferoxamine , patient 's current dose . Labs drawn per week monitor neutrophil count , additional lab every three month monitor ferritin ALT level .</detailed_description>
