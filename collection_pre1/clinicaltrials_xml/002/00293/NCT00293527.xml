	<brief_title>Interferon Alpha-2b ( Intron A ) Metastatic Unresectable Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Interferon long use therapy renal cell carcinoma . However , optimal dose schedule identify patient relegate receive high possible dos prolong period time . This high-dose approach often lead serious adverse effect toxicity limit usefulness patient tolerance treatment . No formal study determine relationship maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) biological effective dose interferon alpha-2b . The current study seek fill gap gather research information different dose interferon alpha-2b correlating measurement JAK/STAT blood . Validation correlative study determine optimum biologic dosing need therapy may adjust appropriately rather current approach maximize dose . In addition , trial low dose daily administer interferon-2b carried current era refine histologic classification modern CT imaging scan . As therapy potentially wide applicability , definite response rate need document . Purpose : The purpose study assess response rate daily low dose interferon-2b patient metastatic unresectable clear cell renal carcinoma . The duration response overall survival determine study participant . This study also evaluate JAK/STAT , two type kinases enzyme involve intracellular signal process associate cancer growth , peripheral blood mononuclear cell course interferon alpha-2b dose escalation . Researchers examine preliminary manner correlation clinical response , toxicity , JAK/STAT signal transduction . Progression free survival rate stable disease also determine preliminary manner . Treatment : Study participant receive interferon alpha-2b . This drug self-administered daily injection skin . The dose level interferon alpha-2b increase week study treatment . For first three week approximately monthly thereafter , patient blood draw three hour follow interferon alpha-2b administration measure JAK/STAT . Toxicity study treatment closely monitor patient clinic visit . Supportive care therapy give throughout study . Treatments discontinue due disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
