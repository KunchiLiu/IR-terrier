	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving docetaxel carboplatin together bevacizumab surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give docetaxel carboplatin together bevacizumab work treat patient stage I , stage II , stage III non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine clinical response rate patient stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer treat neoadjuvant docetaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab . Secondary - Determine median overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine safety profile regimen . - Determine time treatment failure patient treat regimen . - Determine pathologic response rate resectability rate patient treat regimen . - Correlate vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) level expression response survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel IV 15-60 minute , carboplatin IV 30-60 minute , bevacizumab* IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Approximately 4-6 week completion chemotherapy , eligible patient distant mediastinal disease progression undergo lobectomy , pneumonectomy , segmentectomy standard radical mediastinal lymph node dissection . NOTE : *Bevacizumab administer course 1 2 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 8 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
