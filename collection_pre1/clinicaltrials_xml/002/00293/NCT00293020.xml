	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety BEMA fentanyl dose management breakthrough pain cancer subject background opioid therapy . The standard care breakthrough pain episode rapid onset , short act analgesic minimal associate sleepiness . Oral morphine , oxycodone hydromorphone routinely use , slow variable oral absorption , pain control best product . Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate ( OTFC ) use successfully treat breakthrough pain episode associate cancer . OTFC lozenge fentanyl stick administer continuously swab interior subject 's mouth product dissolve ( approximately 15 30 minute ) . The buccal route administration avoids delay variability associate oral absorption . BioDelivery Sciences International , Inc. ( BDSI ) develop BEMA ( BioErodible MucoAdhesive ) fentanyl , alternative product OTFC require subject continuously paint inside mouth dosage form . The BDSI product small disc place mucosal membrane inside mouth . The mucoadhesive polymer disc readily adhere mucosal membrane ( within 5 second ) moisten . The component disc water soluble , entire dosage form dissolve within 30 minute application .</brief_summary>
