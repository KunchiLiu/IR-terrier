	<brief_summary>Heart failure condition heart pump enough blood rest body . People heart failure may another condition call `` metabolic syndrome '' ( excess fat belly , high blood pressure , high fat blood , low level good cholesterol high blood sugar ) . People heart failure metabolic syndrome often see many doctor . A new clinic form Ben Taub General Hospital include specialist heart failure ( cardiologist ) metabolic syndrome ( endocrinologist ) well patient teaching . The goal study randomize patient metabolic syndrome admit hospital heart failure clinic ( collaborative care ) versus usual doctor appointment ( usual care ) . The purpose study see collaborative care well medical care usual care . Specifically , see patient collaborative care : 1. few admission hospital illness 2. good blood pressure , sugar , fat heart failure control 3. well patient satisfaction knowledge diseases 4. low level inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A striking feature Harris County Hospital District heart failure population prevalence obesity ( 50.8 % ) metabolic syndrome ( 48.9 % ) exceed general U.S. population . The metabolic syndrome define presence 3 5 component : abdominal obesity , elevate blood pressure , dyslipidemias ( ↑ triglyceride ↓ high density lipoprotein ) insulin resistance hyperglycemia . Current treatment recommendation metabolic syndrome include lifestyle modification ( diet , exercise , weight control ) target pharmaceutical therapy individual component . Although specialized care metabolic syndrome report , separately , specialty heart failure care endocrinology care show reduce hospital admission health care cost , increase target medication titration disease control , improve quality life , survival patient heart failure diabetes respectively . As heart failure metabolic syndrome commonly find patient , collaborative out-patient management condition clinic novel may significant impact outcome . Hypothesis : Compared usual post-discharge follow-up , collaborative treatment heart failure patient metabolic syndrome team compose endocrinologist , cardiologist , patient educator , nurse case manager result : - Decreased hospital readmission emergency room visit - Health care cost saving - Increased achievement treatment goal ( target blood pressure , HgbA1c , lipid , heart failure medication titration ) - Improved patient satisfaction , knowledge , compliance - Lower level marker inflammation insulin resistance</detailed_description>
