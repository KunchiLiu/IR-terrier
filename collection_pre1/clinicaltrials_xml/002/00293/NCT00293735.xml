	<brief_summary>Eclampsia major cause perinatal morbidity mortality . The pathophysiology know magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Doppler data suggest overperfusion cerebral tissue major etiologic factor . Hypertensive encephalopathy overperfusion , vascular damage excessive arterial pressure ( cerebral barotrauma ) believe lead vasogenic cytotoxic cerebral edema , resultant neuronal anomaly , seizure activity cerebral bleeding leave unchecked . Doppler data show cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) abnormally increase severe preeclampsia autoregulation middle cerebral artery affect condition lead increased CPP . Magnesium sulfate ( MgSO4 ) widely accept eclampsia treatment prophylactic agent , use USA since 1950 's . Despite widespread use , mechanism action unknown . MgSO4 give intravenously intramuscularly require specialized nursing training monitoring minimize toxicity respiratory cardiac depression . Labetalol , combine alpha beta blocker , use many year safely treat hypertension preeclamptic woman , know reduce CPP woman preeclampsia . In United Kingdom labetalol many year use sole agent treat preeclampsia , rate seizure different report USA MgSO4 . Since labetalol administer orally , economical , low toxicity potential , require specialized training administer monitor , decrease CPP , may ideal agent control blood pressure ( BP ) decrease incidence eclampsia woman preeclampsia . The current study multicenter , randomize , control trial compare anti-seizure effect parenteral MgSO4 versus oral labetalol hypertensive pregnant woman eligible MgSO4 therapy . The primary outcome measure eclampsia , secondary outcome measure include blood pressure control , relevant antenatal , intrapartum , postnatal maternal fetal/neonatal parameter include adverse effect complication . Inclusion criterion deliberately broad order make study clinically relevant . Hypertensive pregnant woman , decision delivery make , enrol write , informed consent . Patients randomize receive MgSO4 therapy give institution , versus oral labetalol ( 200mg/q6 hour ) , enrollment study 24 hour post delivery . There 4000 patient arm study analysis intention-to-treat . The study power show therapeutic superiority well clinical equivalence . This study potential change way preeclampsia manage , represent major advance term availability safety prophylactic therapy , especially develop nation MgSO4 underutilized due cost constraint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Labetalol Versus Magnesium Sulfate ( MgSO4 ) Prevention Eclampsia Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods : The study multicenter , randomize , control , clinical trial compare anti-seizure effect parenteral and/or oral labetalol ( n = 4000 ) versus parenteral ( intravenous intramuscular ) magnesium sulfate ( n = 4000 ) mild severe preeclampsia deem sufficient risk warrant seizure prophylaxis magnesium sulfate . This allow 2 % lose follow-up rate . Patients receive labetalol either give 20 mg intravenous load dose IV follow 200 mg oral dose every 6 hour time inclusion study 24 hour postpartum , receive 200 mg oral dose every 6 hour inclusion . Whether IV dose necessary decide clinician charge . Only patient think sufficient risk warrant immediate anti-hypertensive therapy receive initial IV dose . Patients randomized magnesium sulfate group receive intravenous magnesium sulfate 4 6 gram load dose 20 minute follow 1 2 g/h continuous infusion 24 hour postpartum . The exact MgSO4 protocol use determine protocol use institution . We previously show Nimodipine study ( others MAGPIE study ) difference seizure rate 1g/hr 2g/hr protocol . Patients labetalol arm study convulse treat magnesium sulfate . Patients magnesium sulfate arm continue receive magnesium sulfate . All patient convulse manage per unit 's standard protocol eclampsia treatment . Principal Outcome Measure : Occurrence eclamptic seizure ( ) enrollment study . Secondary Outcome Measures 1 . Maternal : - Blood pressure , pulse pressure heart rate change - Need additional antihypertensive medication ( defined need control BP &gt; 160 mmHg systolic and/or 110 mmHg ) - Subjective assessment side effect patient - Objective assessment new onset complication and/or side effect treat clinician - Labor delivery parameter include ; induction delivery interval , rate cervical dilatation , oxytocin dosage , length labor , delivery route , blood loss delivery , postpartum course - Type anesthesia administer ( none , local infiltration delivery , epidural labor , epidural delivery , spinal delivery , combined/spinal epidural labor delivery , general anesthesia delivery ) . 2 . Fetal Neonatal : - Occurrence newly diagnose fetal distress labor necessitate emergent delivery - Umbilical cord gas delivery ( available institution ) ; - Apgar score - Neonatal outcome define NICU admission , hospital survival discharge , length hospital survival , day NICU , need blood transfusion , need pressor agent , need mechanical ventilation , neonatal cardiac dysrhythmias , neonatal cardiac failure , necrotizing enterocolitis , sudden infant death , neonatal sepsis , neonatal hypoglycemia , block record identify complication mention . Institutional Review Informed Consent Procedures : The protocol study approve Institutional Review Board participate institution copy approval file principal investigator prior dispense drug . All patient give write informed consent , protocol describe native language understand English . Study Procedures Informed Consent : The final protocol first approve appropriate IRBs US foreign institution well data coordinate center . All woman must participate informed consent dialogue must give write informed consent prior enrollment participation study . Eligible patient fit require criterion enter study , wish enter study primary physician n't wish participate record . This allow u determine percentage patient eligible enrol . Enrollment : Once delivery plan , inclusion criterion satisfy , patient either approach counseled investigator co-investigator ( may patient 's primary care physician ) inform write consent take , informed study give consent document nurse read telephonically consent investigator site . The nurse document consent form patient consent physician . If patient telephonically consent , site investigator co-sign consent document later time . Entry study way influence obstetric management patient , patient inform freedom withdraw time without compromise standard treatment . All routine patient care routine observation carry labor delivery staff . Each institution USA cross-referenced IND number US Principal Investigator ( # 63,966 ) . This IND number necessary grant funding . The FDA assess study feel require IND number clinical reason since labetalol already approve antihypertensive medication . The reason IND number request allow u satisfy requirement various Federal Funding agency . The foreign institution require IND number require active approval Institutional Review Board . Study Interventions Interventions : Patients assign one two treatment group randomization sequence prepare maintain centrally database . The random permute block method randomization use guarantee time randomization imbalance large certain point number patient group equal . Because study unblinded , random block size use . Randomization stratify clinical center , parity , age assure balance two treatment group respect anticipated difference patient population possible difference patient management . Sufficient stock study drug keep labor delivery area study sit ensure undue delay begin therapy . This reduce chance seizure occur randomization drug administration . Since study intent-to-treat analysis , patient still include analysis group assign . The study drug keep appropriately secure area labor delivery suite site .

Patients randomized labetalol receive two 100 mg tablet orally . The labetalol tablet ( 200 mg ) repeat every 6 hour , unless patient hypotensive ( BP &lt; 90 mmHg systolic and/or 60 mmHg diastolic ) . The tablet swallow maximum 10cc water . In patient clinical team desire rapid intravenous dosing , single 20mg labetalol give oral dose take . Labetalol therapy continue 24 hour post delivery . If blood pressure control ( reduction BP &lt; 160 systolic &lt; 110 mmHg diastolic ) within 40 minute begin labetalol therapy , patient receive intravenous dose 20mg labetalol , increase escalate dose maximum 80mg ( 20 mg , 40 mg , 80 mg ) every 20 minute necessary control blood pressure cumulative maximum 240 mg give . It extremely important blood pressure control outline protocol deviation instruction deem protocol violation . Even repeat labetalol require blood pressure control , patient continue receive 200mg labetalol orally every 6 hour unless bradycardia hypotension ( define blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg systolic and/or &lt; 60 mmHg diastolic ) . If blood pressure control labetalol patient blood pressure control delivery team use whatever agent choose . In institution intravenous labetalol unavailable patient receive intravenous dose 5mg hydralazine , repeat every 20 minute necessary control blood pressure . Patients randomized magnesium sulfate arm study receive 4-6 gram intravenous load dose per institution protocol least 20 minute , follow continuous infusion 1-2 gram per hour . Magnesium sulfate level record per usual protocol participate hospital hospital protocol . Magnesium sulfate level mandatory long active protocol determine presence absence magnesium sulfate toxicity . Magnesium sulfate therapy discontinue 24 hour delivery . If blood pressure control ( reduction BP 160 mmHg systolic 110 mmHg diastolic ) within 40 minute begin magnesium sulfate therapy , patient give intravenous dose 5mg hydralazine , repeat every 20 minute necessary control blood pressure . If patient still need BP control give anything EXCEPT labetalol BP control , i.e . nifedipine , hydralazine , etc . Persistent blood pressure read 160 systolic and/or 110 diastolic protocol violation . Following randomization , patient manage per standard labor delivery protocol preeclampsia institution . The restriction anti-seizure medication ( apart study agent ) give unless patient remove study . Use non seizure-related drug use record case report . The enrollment patient study , choice anti-seizure agent , influence obstetrical management patient . Routine hourly vital sign fetal heart rate monitoring employ . A standardized case report form use study patient . Patients experience seizure prior receive study drug , randomize study , remove active participation study treat accord routine practice institution . Those patient randomize labetalol seizure drug start magnesium sulfate per institutional protocol .

The Trial Coordinator ensure personnel trained system . She monitor enrollment daily basis responsible ensure data transmit central database timely manner data integrity maintain . Study Timetable Patient Recruitment : One major stumble block research pathophysiology eclampsia enrollment sufficient patient achieve statistical significance . No single center capable complete study scope nature propose reasonable time period . For reason essential multicenter network one establish use full capacity support adequately allow happen . All participate institution network deliver excess 1500 patient per year . We show St. Marks University Utah sit enrollment 2 patient per week easily attainable on-site presence encouragement . We ask site enroll minimum 2 patient per week expect large site ( Texas Women 's Hospital - 8000 delivery per annum , University Minnesota Medical Center Hospitals 10 000 patient per annum , Utah HCA facility 8000 delivery per annum ) . Given enrollment 2 patient per week 20 site anticipate annual enrollment least 2000 patient study realistically perform within 5 year . In addition , expect LAMPET Study gain impetus information disseminate within HCA network obstetric institution sit join study . There active program within HCA Perinatal Safety Initiative reward facility Quality Programs . HCA start grade system within obstetric hospital acme `` Center Excellence '' status . This status within HCA organization confers significant advantage facility highly sought designation . One component attain Center Excellence status active obstetric research program , expect LAMPET study establish ongoing , represent attractive option center wish gain Center Excellence goal . As outlined already number large HCA facility commit 0.5 nursing FTE project include grant application . There facility pledge support commit nursing support eligible grant fund small size lower potential enrolling require 2 patient per week . Despite fact pay anything , CEO 's committed 0.5 nursing FTE help small facility participate . We anticipate small hospital also join study disseminate project throughout company divisional meeting national conference . These particular site prepare participate study without support anticipate study progress protocol disseminate HCA facility sign simply Center Excellence designation . This ensure success project . HCA Letter Agreement program allow hospital within system accept IRB approval St. Marks site , thus circumvent time-consuming costly bureaucracy . This allow individual physician group practitioner wish participate research play active role major RCT . Potential Principal Investigators able download protocol template consent Study Website use . All consent form protocol change may make vet Dr. Belfort ensure cosmetic satisfy particular need institution . No substantive change protocol consent form allow . Timetable : 5 year realistic amount time successfully complete study . Statistical Analysis : One widely use procedure interim analysis clinical trial spending function approach Lan DeMets . This method use function time specify rate total Type I error probability spent trial quantity exceed desire alpha level . For study , spend function correspond O'Brien Fleming boundary use . With method , rate type I error spent function fraction total information available time interim analysis ( i.e. , information time ) . The information time determine type statistical test employ . For analysis seizure rate , information time proportion total patient randomize . The table provide Z score time point require consider terminate study early final analysis show statistical significance alpha=0.05 level : The Lan-DeMets procedure flexible total number time sequential analysis need specify advance . Also , requirement look equally space . In clinical trial , however , surprise development may lead extra `` look '' even continuous monitoring data . The Lan-DeMets procedure flexible , switch occasional continuous monitoring data negligible effect Type I error level . Data Monitoring Committee : An independent data monitoring committee establish review progress study . The data monitoring committee meet periodically review trial result , monitor patient safety study progress . The data monitoring committee meet approximately 25 % , 50 % 75 % patient enrol deliver . However , committee responsible decide whether less frequent meeting necessary . The data monitoring committee completely independent study group include member research team individual conflict interest .</detailed_description>
