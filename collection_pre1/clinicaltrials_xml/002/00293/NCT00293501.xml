	<brief_title>Tinzaparin Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine effect tinzaparin sodium fibrin formation ( prothrombin fragment F1.2 ) , thrombin generation ( thrombin-antithrombin complex ) , fibrinolysis ( D-Dimer ) baseline 2 week nadir disease progression patient unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Secondary - Determine effect tinzaparin sodium treatment circulate angiogenesis marker , include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . - Determine proportion patient develop venous thromboembolism hemorrhage . - Determine tolerability tinzaparin sodium treatment 6 month patient . - Establish feasibility undertake multicenter renal cell carcinoma trial specialize coagulation test collection , shipping , processing . - Obtain accurate specific mean , median , variability biomarker data advance RCC patient treat tinzaparin sodium purpose plan large future trial . - Estimate progression-free survival 4 month patient treat tinzaparin sodium . - Correlate progression-free survival change marker coagulation activation angiogenesis . - Correlate anticoagulant activity tinzaparin sodium ( anti-Xa activity ) change coagulation marker , angiogenesis marker , progression-free survival . OUTLINE : This open-label , pilot , multicenter study . Patients receive treatment dose tinzaparin sodium subcutaneously ( SC ) daily 14 day follow prophylactic dose tinzaparin sodium SC daily 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
