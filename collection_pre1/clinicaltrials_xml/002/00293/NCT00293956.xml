	<detailed_description>Transient hypothyroxinemia , demonstrate low T4 free T4 level normal level TSH , preterm infant associate increased severity illness adverse outcome . Effects thyroid function term infant less well study . Previous research Special Care Nursery Christiana Hospital indicate transient hypothyroxinemia intubated term infant associate increased severity illness need intensive rescue therapy . However , free T4 , biologically active substance measure previous study . Infants meet criterion study begin participation parental inform consent obtain . Infants enrol serial measurement thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) , T4 , free T4 , free T3 , cortisol . These measurement obtain four specific time interval throughout first week infant 's life . The medical team blind result hormone test . The result review unblinded study investigator endocrinologist consult abnormal result report . These hormone level compare severity illness level respiratory support need order establish association thyroid function illness severity . Illness severity quantify use Score Neonatal Acute Physiology ( SNAP ) . SNAP score require collect data vital sign result labs consider standard care .</detailed_description>
