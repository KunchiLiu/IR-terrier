	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make person 's tumor cell , gp96 heat shock protein-peptide complex , may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose gp96 heat shock protein-peptide complex vaccine see well work treat patient recurrent progressive high-grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GP96 Heat Shock Protein-Peptide Complex Vaccine Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety best tolerate dose frequency gp96 heat shock protein-peptide complex vaccine patient recurrent progressive high-grade glioma . ( phase I [ close accrual 7/25/2007 ] ) - Determine clinical response treatment , time disease recurrence progression , overall survival patient treat vaccine . ( phase II ) Secondary - Determine immune response patient treat vaccine . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , phase I study ( closed accrual 7/25/2007 ) follow phase II study . - Phase I ( close accrual 7/25/2007 ) : Patients undergo surgical resection . Viable tumor tissue use generate gp96 heat shock protein-peptide complex ( HSPPC-96 ) vaccine . Patients primary disease receive standard adjuvant therapy surgery . Patients whose disease progress standard adjuvant therapy receive HSPPC-96 vaccine . Patients recurrent disease receive HSPPC-96 vaccine 2-8 week surgery . The HSPPC-96 vaccine administer intradermally every 1-3 week 4 dos every 2-3 week thereafter absence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , vaccine depletion . Cohorts 6 patient receive HSPPC-96 vaccine escalate dose frequency maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive HSPPC-96 vaccine phase I appropriate dose frequency determine phase I ( close accrual 7/25/2007 ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
