	<brief_title>131 I-MIBG Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine provide palliative therapy patient refractory relapse neuroblastoma . - Determine acute late toxicity regimen patient . Secondary - Determine disease symptom responses patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : This compassionate use study . Patients receive iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine IV 2 hour . Beginning 10 day later , patient low neutrophil count receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously blood count recovers . Patients stable respond disease may receive second dose iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine least 6 week first dose . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
