	<brief_summary>This clinical trial drug call CMD-193 humanise monoclonal antibody link toxin ( calicheamicin ) . The purpose study determine patient advance tumour express Lewis-Y antigen : - How much long 111-In-CMD-193 ( CMD-193 tag small amount radioactive Indium – also call Indium-111 111In ) circulates blood , antibody go body , much attache tumour . - Whether CMD-193 cause change metabolism ( activity ) tumour . - Whether CMD-193 cause shrinkage tumour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cancers arise organ cure case various combination surgery , chemotherapy radiotherapy . However , cancer spread , treatment conventional method unlikely cure cancer treatment design control growth cancer problem cause . This clinical trial drug call CMD-193 humanise monoclonal antibody link toxin ( calicheamicin ) . The experimental treatment approach use involve target marker ( antigen ) call Lewis-y antigen tumour cell ’ surface specially construct humanised monoclonal antibody . This antibody deliver toxin ( calicheamicin ) tumour cell may kill tumour cell . This clinical research study explore CMD-193 distributes body , activity CMD-193 human . CMD-193 recognises bind Lewis-y antigen present cancer . If radioactive label attach antibody , antibody see special type scan , seek stick tumour . Showing antibody localize tumour may assist determine optimal dose future trial . This study open patient advance cancer tumour sample previously remove show express Lewis-y antigen . A series test perform determine eligibility participate trial . Groups patient allocate increase dos CMD-193 study entry explore effect series dos . Patients receive 6 infusion CMD-193 ( first dose label trace dose radioactive Indium-111 ( 111In ) ) three weekly interval , unless toxicity , disease progression withdrawal study another reason occur . On study , 111-In-CMD-193 give intravenously ( infusion vein ) one hour . Patients observe three hour infusion . An ECG ( heart trace ) perform prior first dose 111-In-CMD-193 repeat 30 minute infusion . To determine body rids CMD-193 , blood sample take 111-In-CMD-193 infusion , three hour infusion completion : 3 total . These blood sample draw separate intravenous access line place vein . Blood sample also draw next day , approximately every second day first week . Special scan see 111-In-CMD-193 go body do approximately one hour first infusion , 3 time next seven day . The procedure take one hour time . Further blood test do per week , coincide clinical visit . These sample check general health blood cell blood chemistry , assess blood level CMD-193 . Blood test also see immune system recognises infuse antibody make another antibody . Evaluation function ( metabolism ) tumour also perform special scan call Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan . This PET scan perform first CMD-193 infusion , 2nd 4th infusion CMD-193 . Tumour assessment take place study appropriate test CT scan , plain X-rays etc . These scan repeat 15-21 day 2nd , 4th 6th infusion CMD-193 . Additional infusion CMD-193 may administer patient tolerated CMD-193 treatment evidence response .</detailed_description>
