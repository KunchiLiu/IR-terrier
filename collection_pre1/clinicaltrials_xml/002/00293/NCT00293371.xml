	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel prednisone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vatalanib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving vatalanib together docetaxel prednisone may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose vatalanib give together docetaxel prednisone see well work treat patient advanced prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel , Prednisone , Vatalanib Treating Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose vatalanib use combination docetaxel prednisone patient chemotherapy-naive , metastatic , hormone-refractory prostate cancer . ( phase I ) Secondary - Determine alteration pharmacokinetics docetaxel vatalanib patient . ( phase I ) - Determine clinical efficacy regimen measure decline prostate-specific antigen , measurable disease response , time progression , overall survival . ( phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I open-label , dose-escalation study vatalanib* follow phase II study . - Phase I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 2 . Patients also receive oral prednisone twice daily oral vatalanib daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos vatalanib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . NOTE : *Vatalanib administer day 5-21 first course . - Phase II : Patients receive prednisone , docetaxel , vatalanib MTD phase I . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 93 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
