	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Chemotherapy Poor-Risk Patients With Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Patients advance stage head neck cancer , especially disease hypopharynx , oropharynx , oral cavity , poor performance status define clinical testing , often eligible clinical trial treat best supportive care . The possibility develop well-tolerated chemotherapy regimen patient may lead equivalent benefit well palliation . The current study offer chemotherapy drug pemetrexed patient advanced head neck cancer . Researchers consider agent anti-tumor efficacy variety site-specific cancer , include head neck cancer response rate similar single chemotherapy drug . In addition , previous research indicate toxicity associate pemetrexed reduced patient give folic acid B12 vitamin supplementation . Along pemetrexed , current study provide study participant folic acid B12 . Purpose : The primary objective study evaluate tumor response , include complete partial remission , toxicity pemetrexed patient advanced head neck cancer . Secondary objective study include measurement time tumor progression , survival , patient quality life . Treatment : Study participant give pemetrexed intravenous infusion . Pemetrexed administer every three week . This schedule pemetrexed every three week repeat six time . Study participant also provide folic acid B12 vitamin supplementation , , study treatment pemetrexed . Vitamin supplementation consider critical compliance must follow closely . Several test exams give throughout study monitor patient . Treatments discontinue due disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
