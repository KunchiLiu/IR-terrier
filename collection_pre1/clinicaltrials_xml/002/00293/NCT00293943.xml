	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate significance complete versus incomplete electrical isolation pulmonary vein radiofrequency-induced linear lesion patient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . The study hypothesis ist complete linear PV isolation ablation superior non-complete linear PV isolation outcome patient idiopathic drug-refractory atrial fibrillation . As second hypothesis adaptive study design , non-inferiority complete linear PV isolation strategy test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation cure elimination trigger event atrial extrasystole originate pulmonary vein ( PV ) selective linear radiofrequency current application . Although electrical isolation demonstrate circumferential mapping catheter position PV ostium , longterm effect EP-guided PV isolation procedure achieve 60-70 % stable sinus rhythm follow-up even experience center . Re-investigation symptomatic patient initially electrically isolated PVs demonstrate substantial amount PV reconduction might explain arrhythmia recurrence . Although demonstrated linear lesion PV isolation superior selective ablation approach , conflict data exists necessity achieve complete linear lesion . The group Pappone et al Oral et al publish success rate 90 % patient sinusrhythm irrespective line completeness , group estimate reach 30 % case . Several advantage disadvantage could advocate either complete versus incomplete ablation strategy : Performing complete EP-guided linear PV isolation strategy might take long ( mean duration 4.5 hour vs 2 hour ) could thereby potentially result high risk procedure-associated complication ( air embolism , thrombus formation , perforation ) . In addition , three transseptal sheath might increase risk tamponade might aggravate ability safely navigate catheter leave atrium . Certainly , procedure cost higher , since addition 3D mapping system two circular map catheter mandatory facilitate lesion deployment avoidance intra-PV ablation . In addition , ablation strategy depend complete line deployment may sufficient achieve stable sinus rhythm . Although , additional linear lesion PV isolation segment towards mitral annulus propose several center incomplete linear PV isolation approach might necessary achieve stable sinus rhythm . Potential complication atrio-esophageal fistula formation could avoid additional lesion eg . along LA roof would necessary . Both cost additional material ( transseptal sheath , circular mapping catheter ) short procedure duration ( 2 hour ) would reduce . On hand , cost would balance reduced number re-ablation , incomplete PV isolation would indeed lead high AF recurrence rate . Since data exist time course deploy ablation line . Do patient recurrences AF always PV reconduction ? Vice versa , also remain unclear patient stable sinus rhythm experience effect base longterm PV isolation . To assess significance time course PV isolation , propose study protocol consist therefore invasive re-evaluation primarily ablate pt schedule 3 month follow-up regardless arrhythmia recurrence investigate PV conduction property . Finally , patient symptomatic AF underwent intensify ECG monitor indicate standard clinical procedure ( assessment symptom surface ECG recording long interval ) sufficient detect recurrent AF . Therefore , daily ECG monitoring plan trial detect asymptomatic episode AF . The propose study protocol aim investigate prospective , randomized fashion significance complete versus incomplete PV isolation RFC-induced linear lesion . The ablation randomize linear encircle around ipsilateral PVs endpoint complete PV isolation proven two circumferential map catheter versus ablation procedure terminate instantaneously total PV isolation occur , thereby allow least one conduction gap along isolation line . An invasive re-evaluation schedule 3 month pt assess longterm PV conduction property .</detailed_description>
