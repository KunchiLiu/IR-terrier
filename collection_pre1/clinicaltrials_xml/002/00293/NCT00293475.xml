	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect methotrexate , mannitol , rituximab , carboplatin see well work treat patient primary central nervous system lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , methotrexate carboplatin , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption use mannitol open blood vessel around brain allow cancer-killing substance carry directly brain . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Giving methotrexate , mannitol , rituximab , carboplatin together may effective treatment primary central nervous system lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety toxicity treatment regimen consist rituximab ( intravenously [ IV ] ) day prior methotrexate ( intra-arterially [ IA ] ) , carboplatin ( IA ) conjunction blood-brain barrier disruption ( BBBD ) delay sodium thiosulfate ( IV ) . II . To demonstrate , add monoclonal antibody carboplatin methotrexate BBBD , 45 % rate complete response ( CR ) within first 3 month treatment achieve , exclude CR rate low 30 % . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate response rate ( count CRs ) , two-year overall survival two-year event-free survival , baseline subsequent trial . OUTLINE : Patients receive rituximab IV 5 hour day 1 , mannitol IA , methotrexate IA 10 minute , carboplatin IA 10 minute day 2 3 . Patients receive sodium thiosulfate IV 15 minute 4 8 hour carboplatin . Treatment repeat monthly 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 month , every 2 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually least 2 year .</detailed_description>
