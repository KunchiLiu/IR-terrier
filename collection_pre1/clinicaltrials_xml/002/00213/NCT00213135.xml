	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Oral Cladribine Subjects With Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis ( RRMS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , three-arm , placebo-controlled , multi-center study . The study include pre-study evaluation period ( 28 day prior start treatment ) ; initial treatment period Week 1 48 ; re-treatment period Week 49 96 . During initial treatment period ( Week 1 48 ) , eligible subject equally randomized central randomization system receive either ) cladribine low dose ( 0.875 milligram per kilogram per course [ mg/kg/course ] two course plus placebo two course ) ; b ) cladribine high dose ( 0.875 mg/kg/course four course ) ; c ) placebo ( four course ) . During re-treatment period ( Weeks 49 96 ) , subject receive either ) cladribine low dose ( 0.875 mg/kg/course two course ) ; b ) placebo ( two course ) . For randomized subject , rescue option treatment RebifÂ® ( interferon beta-1a 44 microgram ( mcg ) give subcutaneously three time week ) , subject experience one qualifying relapse , and/or experience sustained increase EDSS score great equal ( &gt; = ) 1 point , &gt; =1.5 point baseline EDSS score 0 , ( period three month great ) , calendar year begin Week 24 . To maintain blind , treat physician view clinical laboratory result assess adverse event safety information , independent blind evaluate physician perform neurological exam . A central neuroradiology center , also blind treatment , assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evaluation .</detailed_description>
