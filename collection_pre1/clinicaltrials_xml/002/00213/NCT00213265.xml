	<brief_summary>We plan study whether 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( Prevnar™ ) safe effective protect child solid organ transplantation healthy child pneumococcal infection . We expect two dos Prevnar™ result similar antibody response among transplant recipient compare healthy control subject , child undergo solid organ transplant similar number serious vaccine-related adverse event within 7 day Prevnar™ healthy patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Solid organ transplantation ( SOT ) emerge lifesaving therapy many patient end organ failure . SOT recipients lifelong increase risk infection result immunosuppression , include cause pneumococcus . The increased susceptibility pneumococcal infection multi-factorial related underlying immunosuppression well vary degree splenic dysfunction result underlie pretransplantation disease , among factor . The type severity invasive pneumococcal disease vary among transplant population . However , comparative data lacking . Lung transplant recipient high incidence bacterial pneumonia among solid organ transplant recipient . Pneumonia secondary Streptococcus pneumoniae occur heart transplant patient rate 10 time find general population . It suggest besides intensity immunosuppression , ongoing immunosuppression important risk factor invasive pneumococcal disease transplant recipient . Despite fact 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine one vaccines receives priority among organ transplant recipient , Hospital Sick Children , several case pneumococcal disease see . The advent 7-valent conjugate vaccine affords opportunity possibly reduce burden pneumococcal disease patient population virtue may immunogenic transplant patient This study examine antibody titre achieve among transplant recipient immunize Prevnar™ , well evaluate safety tolerability Prevnar™ administer three-dose regimen child adolescent follow organ transplantation .</detailed_description>
