	<brief_title>The Effect Needle Temperature Pain Ratings Following Intramuscular Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza virus infection cause significant morbidity mortality season . More 90 million dos influenza vaccine administer season . All vaccine dos , except two million , administer intramuscular injection . Surprisingly little research do evaluate appropriate intramuscular injection technique . A small proportion population annual influenza immunization indicate may self-defer pain associated administration vaccine . Injection procedure cause minor pain . Ice pack often use local anesthesia . Decreasing pain associate intramuscular injection decrease needle temperature could inexpensive , simple way decrease injection fear increase immunization rate . To test hypothesis , use double blind control study design . Study participant receive two injection . One injection contain 0.5ml next season 's influenza vaccine . The injection contain 0.5ml normal saline . Each study participant randomly assign order injection frozen room temperature needle . ( Figure 1 ) We include two injection increase amount information obtain study . In addition determine frozen needle decrease discomfort associate injection influenza vaccine , may able make study generalizable frozen needle also decrease pain associate normal saline intramuscular injection . Further rationale study design cover unable administer injection two site person visit vary temperature needle . To minimize variability , injection administer immunizer blind study group assignment . We maintain blind immunizer person prepare injection hand fill syrinx immunizer uncapped since immunizer would likely able feel cold frozen needle needle uncapping . A 1 inch 23 gauge needle ( safety injection device ; Eclipse BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) use participant 90kg . A 1 Â½ inch needle use large participant . We ask individual rate pain injection use standard 10 point pain scale.1 Each participant ask injection less painful he/she tell u frozen needle use either injection . Members research team call email subject 2-4 day administration injection . During phone call , subject ask rate current pain injection site . They also ask notice redness around injection site . This additional phone call help determine needle temperature affect delay injection site reaction ( minor soreness and/or redness around injection site last 1-3 day injection ) addition immediate effect . To determine effect influenza vaccine administer cold needle , measure antibody response influenza vaccine . Blood drawn immediately follow administration intramuscular injection pain score subset study participant . Sub-study participant return 2-4 week second blood draw measure post-immunization antibody concentration .</detailed_description>
