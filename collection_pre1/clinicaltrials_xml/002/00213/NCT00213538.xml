	<brief_summary>The objective study identify validate predictive marker anakinra responsiveness RA patient transcriptomic approach . Patients active RA ( ACR criterion ) give subcutaneous anakinra ( 100mg/d ) 3 associated metotrexate . Anakinra efficacy evaluate week 12 , use EULAR response criterion . A blood sample collect onset anakinra treatment total RNAs extract peripheral blood mononuclear cell . The [ 33P ] radiolabeled mRNAs hybridize ( duplicate triplicate ) set 10.000 human cDNA probe spot high density nylon membrane . Data normalize filter allow comparison RNA sample . Statistical analysis perform R software hierarchical clustering perform Cluster Tree View software .</brief_summary>
