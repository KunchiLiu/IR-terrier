	<brief_title>Comparison Anastrozole Verses Clomiphene Citrate Stimulating Follicular Growth Ovulation Infertile Women With Ovulatory Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind study . Upon provision Informed Consent , subject screen entry menstrual cycle prior anticipated start treatment . All screening assessment complete within 6 week treatment , unless otherwise note . Subjects meet screening requirement equally randomize one three follow treatment arm : - Anastrozole 1 mg/day 5 day - Anastrozole 5 mg/day 5 day - Clomiphene citrate 50 mg/day 5 day Treatment begin cycle day 2 3 subsequent menses ( cycle day 1 = first day full bleed ) . Subjects return clinic Stimulation Days 3 4 6 7 ( note : Stimulation Day 1 equal first day study drug ) blood sample ultrasound . Ultrasound serum monitoring repeat every 2 day thereafter lead follicle reach mean diameter ³ 14 mm , daily LH surge occur . Monitoring discontinue lead follicle ³ 14 mm develop Stim Day 18 cycle ( inadequate treatment cycle ) serum progesterone obtain one week discontinue monitoring . A subgroup subject select additional pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic analysis Cycle 1 . Blood sample collect selected timepoints analysis anastrozole/clomiphene citrate , estradiol , FSH , LH , androstendione , testosterone . This subgroup consist approximately 40-50 subject carry predetermined investigative center . Insemination occur via intercourse IUI within 24 hour follow LH surge . Subjects return center mid-luteal phase pelvic ultrasound blood sample local central progesterone day 6 7 LH surge , also return repeat blood sample progesterone day 8 9 LH surge . Ovulation confirm progesterone level ³ 10 ng/mL . If result progesterone test indicate patient ovulate , subject bring back one two day later repeat progesterone test . In ovulatory cycle , pregnancy test perform day 15 20 post-LH surge . Subjects positive pregnancy test test repeat within 2 4 day return clinic day 35-42 post-LH surge confirmatory ultrasound . Subjects may allow continue two additional treatment cycle fail achieve clinical pregnancy first treatment cycle , experience SAE mandatory withdrawal condition . Subsequent treatment assign dose randomize dose subject .</detailed_description>
