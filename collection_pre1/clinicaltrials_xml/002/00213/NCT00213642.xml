	<brief_summary>Cisplatin heavy-metal complex widely use treatment variety malignancy , include small cell non-small cell lung cancer , ovarian , bladder , head neck , esophageal , cervical germ cell tumor . The administration cisplatin commonly associate certain drug-induced toxicity may limit clinical utility adversely affect quality life patient undergoing treatment . Although many advance make reduce toxicity associate platinum drug therapy , clear dose-limiting nephrotoxicity remain major stumble block use compound . Subtle change renal function occur without overt renal insufficiency , consist decrease effective renal plasma flow tubular dysfunction despite aggressive hydratation . Early tubular damage occur within 1 3 hour cisplatin administration demonstrate measurement urinary beta 2-microglobulin , sensitive marker tubular injury . The chronic lesion become great concern recent year many patient cure placed long-term remission due cisplatin treatment . It consist decrease glomerular filtration rate , necessary characterize remarkable increase serum creatinine . Cumulative tubular damage demonstrate increased urinary excretion tubular enzyme alanine aminopeptidase beta 2-microglobulin . In set , predict occurrence chronic cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity remain clinical challenge . Tc-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine ( MAG3 ) predominantly proximal tubular secretion renal agent without cortical fixation indicate dynamic renal study evaluate cortical tubular function collect system drainage . Tc-99m MAG3 agent choice obstructive uropathy diffuse functional abnormality renal cortex . The aim study evaluate mean Tc-99m MAG3 scintigraphy acute subacute impairment tubular secretion cisplatin administration patient head neck cancer receive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
