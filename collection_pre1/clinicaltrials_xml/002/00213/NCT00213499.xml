	<brief_summary>The clinical efficacy noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) demonstrate management acute-on-chronic respiratory failure ( ACRF ) various etiology . Endotracheal mechanical ventilation ( ETMV ) lead numerous complication wean difficulty increase risk prolong ETMV , morbidity mortality well excess cost intensive care . Therefore , could interest use NIV deliver effective ventilatory support reduce length ETMV ACRF patient still capable maintain spontaneous breathing . From interest discordant result two recent randomise controlled trial , work group Société de Réanimation de Langue Française ( SRLF ) decide perform new prospective randomise control multicenter trial . The aim study ass usefulness NIV extubation wean technique ventilate ACRF patient . The methodology use compare three wean strategy parallel ACRF patient consider difficult wean : invasive conventional weaning ( group A ) , extubation relay nasal oxygentherapy ( group B ) , extubation relay NIV ( group C ) . Based main end-point define weaning success/failure rate , 208 patient from17 investigator center plan include . Results study also allow assess respective impact three wean strategy length ETMV weaning , mechanical ventilation-related morbidity , patient lengths stay mortality . Results VENISE trial permit improve management difficult wean ACRF patient thus contribute define place NIV among wean prevention re-intubation strategy patient .</brief_summary>
