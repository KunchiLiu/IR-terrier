	<brief_summary>The goal multicentric French randomize trial determine best auto fluorescence bronchial endoscopic follow-up strategy high risk patient bear low grade bronchial precancerous lesion . Subjects randomly assign one follow arm : ( A ) every 6 month clinical chest Xrays follow-up without intermediate endoscopy , ( B ) every 6 month clinical chest Xrays follow-up include repeat autofluorescence endoscopy biopsy 6 month basis case low grade dysplasia one year basis patient without dysplasia . After 36 month follow-up , patient two group subject final autofluorescence endoscopy biopsy Spiral Chest Xray . The final analysis compare two group : 1 . The probability progression initially identify low grade lesion high grade lesion 2 . The probability respiratory epithelial tract progression assess occurrence lung cancer high grade lesion . 3 . The characteristic lung cancer detect arm 4 . In arm , influence risk factor persistent exposure tobacco lesion evolutivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal multicentric French randomize trial determine best auto fluorescence bronchial endoscopic follow-up strategy high risk patient bear low grade bronchial precancerous lesion . This Trial compare two follow-up modality : observation without endoscopy three year period ( group A `` light `` follow-up ) , versus repeat autofluorescence endoscopy biopsy every six month three year ( group B `` intensive `` ) . Methods : 300 subject high risk lung cancer include two year period followed-up three year . In subject auto-fluorescence endoscopy Chest CT scan perform enrollment trial . To include subject must present initial Chest CT scan suspicious lung cancer bronchial biopsy show moderate dysplasia low grade lesion . Subjects randomly assign one follow arm : ( A ) every 6 month clinical chest Xrays follow-up without intermediate endoscopy , ( B ) every 6 month clinical chest Xrays follow-up include repeat autofluorescence endoscopy biopsy 6 month basis case low grade dysplasia one year basis patient without dysplasia . Stratifications factor randomization : Center , occupational exposure respiratory carcinogen , presence bronchial low dysplastic lesion versus absence dysplasia . Bronchial biopsy sample centrally review panel Pathologists . After 36 month follow-up , patient two group subject final autofluorescence endoscopy biopsy Spiral Chest Xray . The final analysis compare two group : 1 . The probability progression initially identify low grade lesion high grade lesion 2 . The probability respiratory epithelial tract progression assess occurrence lung cancer high grade lesion . 3 . The characteristic lung cancer detect arm 4 . In arm , influence risk factor persistent exposure tobacco lesion evolutivity . First inclusion trial : July 2002 , End recruitment December 2005 , End follow- : december 2008 . An ancillary study analyse performance fibered confocal fluorescence microscopy start december 2005 IRB/ethical comity approval . This ancillary study perform Rouen University Hospital Center .</detailed_description>
