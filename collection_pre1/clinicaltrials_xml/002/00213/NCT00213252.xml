	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate child acute asthma give single dose oral prednisolone subsequent daily five-day course oral Montelukast achieve therapeutic failure rate day 8 significantly high give six daily dos oral prednisolone . Secondary objective include comparison two group respect change symptom , beta2 agonist , clinical asthma score day without asthma day 8 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Montelukast Treat Children With Mild Moderate Acute Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan randomize double blind double-dummy trial 190 previously healthy child 2-17 year age present Emergency Department ( ED ) Hospital Sick Children Toronto mild moderate acute asthma , Pulmonary Index score ≤ 11 point PRAM ≤ 8 point . Asthma define least second episode wheezing , sign low airway obstruction . All participate child receive single dose oral prednisolone 2mg/kg ( max 60 mg ) arrival standardize inhaled salbutamol ED five day thereafter . At discharge ED child randomize two interventional group . Those Montelukast group get oral Montelukast 4 mg ( 2-5 year old ) , 5 mg ( 6-14 year old ) , 10 mg ( 15-17 year old ) well daily prednis ( ol ) one placebo 24 hour ED dose prednisolone 48 , 72 , 96 120 hour , prednisolone group receive Montelukast placebo daily oral prednisolone 1mg/kg ( max 60 mg ) five dos time . The primary outcome therapeutic failure two group randomization day 8 . This failure define unscheduled medical visit asthma symptom hospitalization treatment oral corticosteroid outside experimental protocol . Secondary outcome measure include comparison number salbutamol treatment , change previously validate daytime symptom scale , nighttime cough/awakening scale , number asthma-free day within 8 day observational period two group , change PI PRAM score 48 hour day 8 well association main treatment effect age , pulmonary index randomization history atopy . This study take two 9 month period . Primary analysis include one-sided 95 % CI difference failure rate prednisolone group minus Montelukast group . Secondary analysis include repeat measure ANOVA difference change continuous variable Fisher 's Exact test comparison proportion . An exploratory sub-group logistic regression analysis do examine interaction main treatment effect possible covariates . In event patient give single dose prednisolone follow Montelukast comparable therapeutic failure rate give standard extend prednisolone therapy , administration Montelukast may help u abbreviate length corticosteroid therapy child acute asthma .</detailed_description>
