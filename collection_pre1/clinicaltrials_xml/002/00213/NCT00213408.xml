	<brief_summary>Catheter ablation typical atrial flutter well establish technique high acute success rate low complication recurrence rate . It also show ablation recurrent symptomatic typical atrial flutter lead clear improvement quality life . We seek evaluate cost/effectiveness catheter ablation first line therapy patient suffer first symptomatic typical atrial flutter episode . This study multicenter trial patient first symptomatic episode typical atrial flutter randomize undergo ablation receive antiarrhythmic drug electrical cardioversion . Clinical examination , quality life questionnaires,12 lead ECG 24-hour Holter monitoring perform 1 , 3 , 6 12 month follow randomization.The primary end-point absence recurrence typical atrial flutter - 12 month follow . The secondary end point cost cost/effectiveness ratio two approach .</brief_summary>
