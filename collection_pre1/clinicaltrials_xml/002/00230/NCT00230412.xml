	<brief_title>Study Heat Shock Proteins Prognostic Factor Acute Renal Failure Children ( HSP-Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prognostic factor development acute renal failure ( ANR ) child would valuable therapy regulation . So-called chaperone family heat shock protein ( HSP ) promise candidate involve development ANR well . This could start point development new therapeutic approach . ANR occur 50 percent critical ill patient high rate morbidity mortality despite advance symptomatic therapy . Following severe sepsis , septic shock shock , combine multiple organ failure , ANR autonomous prognosis worsen factor . Should result study show correlation production HSP outcome child ANR , study would require , examine pathophysiological relevance HSP ANR . We would able determine high risk population ANR . A modulation ANR therapy might result study .</detailed_description>
