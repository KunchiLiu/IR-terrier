	<detailed_description>NAFLD common liver disease United States also common cause abnormal liver test United States . NAFLD include mild well severe nonalcoholic fatty liver disease involve liver cell inflammation damage , call Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . NAFLD usually discover abnormal liver test liver ultrasound CT scan person normal liver enzymes . Liver biopsy may show mix fat , inflammation scar liver . Patients NAFLD drink large amount alcohol cause type liver damage . NAFLD think related obesity diabetes . Unfortunately , little information important feature NAFLD . These include biochemical , genetic feature may help predict disease progression . The known risk factor include high blood sugar lipid level . Patients NAFLD often resistance normal action insulin , hormone important processing sugar fat . Increased resistance insulin lead fat liver . Currently , proven treatment NAFLD . Several study animal suggest diet contain high level omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) decrease amount liver fat . It long know omega-3 fatty acid several health benefit . For example , diet rich fatty acid reduces amount certain fat ( `` triglyceride '' ) blood , might improve action important hormone insulin . Omega-3 fatty acid contain certain plant oil ( canola oil linseed oil ) marine fish ( salmon ) . The purpose study determine effect dietary supplementation Ï‰-3 polyunsaturated v monounsaturated fatty acid intrahepatic fat content patient non-alcoholic fatty liver disease determine magnetic resonance spectroscopy</detailed_description>
