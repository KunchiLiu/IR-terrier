	<brief_title>OSI-774 African American Patients With Advanced Previously Treated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Researchers seek identify treatment regimens low toxicity non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , especially African Americans disease seem large burden comorbidities decrease performance status . The current study use drug call OSI-774 previously treat African American patient NSCLC . OSI-774 target agent design EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Previous research indicate tumor cell overexpress EGFR receptor , drug work block receptor tumor cell help grow . OSI-774 FDA approve treatment patient non-small cell lung cancer previously treat chemotherapy . Unfortunately , little data exist pharmacokinetics metabolism EGFR blocker African Americans assessment efficacious agent patient group . Yet , research suggest EGFR blockage may great impact patient population . Since development skin rash follow therapy EGFR blocker may surrogate obtain sufficient concentration tissue level potential efficacy , current study randomize phase II trial design compare normal dose level OSI-774 dose level determine body weight subsequent amount adjust study generate skin rash . Through current study , researcher test theory dose method increase number patient effective tissue concentration result increase patient response . Purpose : The primary objective study determine objective tumor response rate , time tumor progression , survival rate one year produce OSI-774 previously treat African American patient advance NSCLC . A second objective evaluate regimen single agent OSI-774 , dose initially influence body weight subsequent titration achieve skin rash suitable regimen future study agent . A third objective measure change EGFR tumor blood cell correlate development rash clinical benefit . The pharmacokinetics OSI-774 also characterize study participant . Treatment : Patients study give OSI-774 . A computer randomly assign patient one two treatment group . Group one give standard dose OSI-774 . The dose OSI-774 increase group one . However , patient group one dose level decrease due unacceptable side effect . Group two receive OSI-774 dose modify body weight study entry subsequently adjust study generate skin rash . For study participant , OSI-774 administer daily oral pill . Several test exams give throughout study closely monitor patient . Treatments discontinue due disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
