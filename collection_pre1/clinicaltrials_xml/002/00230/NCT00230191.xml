	<detailed_description>Approximately 42,000 new case head neck squamous cell carcinoma occur annually United States . Radiotherapy ( “ RT ” ) play significant role management head neck cancer . The common clinically significant toxicity arise head neck radiation therapy acute mucositis acute chronic xerostomia ( dry mouth salivary gland change ) . In subject receive RT cancer oral cavity oropharynx incidence acute mucositis exceed 90 % . The painful ulceration oral mucosa produce radiation often lead requirement narcotic control pain , inability eat , dehydration , need parenteral nutrition , sometimes , breaks RT . In addition symptomatic cost , presence mucositis associate number adverse outcomes include high cost frequent hospitalization .</detailed_description>
