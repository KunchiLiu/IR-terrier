	<brief_summary>The value fusion functional anatomical data describe use several fusion technique various nuclear medicine procedure morphologic image modality ( SPECT-CT , SPECT-MRI , Coincidence-CT ) . We hypothesize NM -CT data advantage data obtain use separately perform NM study conventional anatomic imaging CT. We hypothesize accurate localization radio-isotope activity NM image improve diagnostic accuracy impact patient management : Improved accuracy NM study improve tumor localization , evaluation extent disease post therapy follow . It direct diagnostic procedure lesion otherwise undetected , exclude need invasive procedure . It also guide invasive procedure radiation-therapy planning , thus improve therapy result avoid unnecessary treatment-related side effect .</brief_summary>
