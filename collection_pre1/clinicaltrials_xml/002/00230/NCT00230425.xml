	<detailed_description>Epidemiological clinical study show association symptom anxiety depression ( mood ) alcohol abuse . However , association alcohol abuse mood syndrome inconsistent . One problem mood syndrome tend poorly define . Also , researcher typically rely retrospective recall patient evaluate mood symptom . Some evidence : 1 . Most mood symptom improve withdrawal inpatient alcoholism program without specific treatment mood disorder . 2 . Family genetic study show cosegregation . 3 . Psychiatric treatment mood syndrome decrease alcohol use . 4 . The self-treatment view support control drinking study . To overcome difficulty , recently develop procedure measure mood variability occur . We ask participant rate mood twice day 10 cm straight line anchor term `` '' `` much '' ( visual analogue scale ) ( VAS ) . There 3 separate line “ anxiety/tension ” , “ sadness/low mood ” “ high mood ” . We compute quantitative measure variability `` mean square successive difference statistic '' ( MSSD ) . Our early work find method identify great mood variability individual anxiety disorder compare individual without anxiety disorder . Our null hypothesis : 1 . That woman lifetime diagnosis alcohol abuse demonstrate high symptom anxiety , depression , neuroticism mood variability control group ; 1a . That severity symptom correlate performance measure sustain attention . The MINI diagnostic interview use derive DSM-IV diagnosis . This brief semi-structured diagnostic interview use previously . We use extensive interview schedule SCID recruiting specific diagnostic group . Participants ask complete 4 scale validators diary visual analogue scale . These : 1 . The Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI-II ) . This widely use self- complete depression questionnaire . It 21 item , 4 choice . 2 . The Spielberger Trait-State Self-Evaluation Questionnaire ( STAI-T ) . This 20 item- questionnaire , answer 4-point scale . It widely use trait anxiety inventory . 3 . The Mood Disorders Questionnaire .

These item answer yes/no . Participants female , age 18-50 year diagnose alcohol abuse . Exclusion criterion chronic medical , psychiatric brain condition might affect mood variability test performance . Comorbid drug abuse reason exclusion . Only females include study 1 . The association mood symptom substance abuse appear clear woman ( In men , characteristic impulsivity antisocial trait prominent ) . 2 . We already data mood variability predominantly female normal control subject study Department Psychiatry Royal University Hospital . Participants test 3rd 4th week program , i.e . free alcohol illicit drug consumption 3 week . Use medication note exclusion .</detailed_description>
