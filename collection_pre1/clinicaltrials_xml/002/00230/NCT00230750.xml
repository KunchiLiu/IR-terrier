	<brief_summary>The purpose research study compare body reacts different strength new H5N1 flu vaccine . Researchers also look antibody make subject receive H5N1 flu vaccine . Participants include least 240 healthy male female , age 65 older . The vaccine give injection shot arm . Subjects receive 3 dos vaccine Day 0 , Month 1 Month 6 . There 2 different dos new H5N1 vaccine give study . There also chance subject may receive placebo ( dummy ) injection saltwater instead flu vaccine . Study procedure include physical exam blood sample collection . Additionally , participant complete memory aid card document daily temperature symptom experience week receive vaccine . The length participation study approximately 14 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study compare safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity two dose level monovalent subvirion influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine administer injection healthy elderly adult age 65 year old . Researchers hypothesize dose either 45 microgram 90 microgram H5N1 vaccine well tolerate result acceptable immunogenicity . Thus , primary goal study determine low dose level H5N1 result acceptable proportion subject achieve potentially protective postvaccination antibody titer combine acceptable safety profile . The study enroll least 240 ( 260 ) healthy ambulatory male female subject age 65 old , United States , may enrol . Three dos vaccine 2 dose level ( 45 microgram 90 microgram ) saline placebo administer 28 day apart first two dos . The third dose give six month first dose . Serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) neutralize antibody titer assess approximately 1 month receipt dose 6 month first third dos . The primary objective study : determine dose-related safety intramuscular ( IM ) subvirion inactivate H5N1 vaccine healthy elderly adult ( 65 year age old ) ; determine immunogenicity IM subvirion inactivate H5N1 vaccine approximately 1 month follow receipt 2 dos vaccine ; provide information selection best dose level ( ) study . The secondary objective determine immunogenicity IM subvirion inactivate H5N1 vaccine approximately 1 6 month follow receipt first third dos vaccine . The primary endpoint include : adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) information ( solicit in-clinic via memory aid , concomitant medication , periodic target physical assessment ) ; proportion subject achieve serum neutralize antibody titer 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) ; geometric mean titer ( GMT ) frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) . The secondary endpoint include : development serum antibody responses antigenically drifted variant H5N1 influenza virus geometric mean titer frequency 4-fold great increase serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) neutralize antibody titer 1 6 month receipt first third dose vaccine . The duration study approximately 15 month ( approximately 14 month subject ) . This study link DMID protocols 07-0022 05-0006 .</detailed_description>
