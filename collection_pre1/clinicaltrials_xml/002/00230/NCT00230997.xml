	<brief_summary>TRIAL SUMMARY : This open-label , 24-week , investigator initiate study evaluate safety efficacy galantamine ( 16 8 24 mg/day ; flexible dosing ) treatment Dementia Lewy body . The primary efficacy variable NPI -12 , COGDRAS test attention visuospatial orientation , ADCS-CGIC . The secondary efficacy variable MMSE , ADCS-ADL-Inventory , ADAS-Cog , PSQI , use concomitant rescue antipsychotic medication . PET scan obtain 10 patient one site . An interim analysis also perform . Safety outcome measure adverse event report , vital sign , physical examination , ECG , laboratory parameter UPDRS ( motor subscale ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Galantamine Patients With Dementia With Lewy Bodies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRIAL DESIGN 1 . Rationale In previously publish study DLB treat rivastigmine , efficacy see maximize 20 week multiple parameter compare placebo . The efficacy see NPI - 4 well NPI -10 , MMSE Computerized Cognitive Assessment Systems Score5 . There change UPDRS score . The efficacy rivastigmine patient DLB respond great 30 percent behavioral measure equal good study antipsychotic medication use behavioral abnormality DLB AD patient . Since titration galantamine involve less time titration rivastigmine , interim analysis may show efficacy 12 week . However , complete efficacy safety evaluation , 24-week treatment galantamine preferable . Since cholinergic deficit DLB patient profound AD patient , dose range 16 8 24 mg/day DLB patient sufficient show efficacy . Since galantamine previously show efficacious domain behavior , cognition , ADL 's global assessment AD patient , expect efficacy show similarly perhaps great extent DLB patient . TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS There seven visit 24-week treatment trial galantamine DLB . For visits time window +/- 3 day relative baseline visit V2 applicable . Screen : Visit 1 ( -4 week – 0 ) At visit 1 ( V1 ) subject evaluated suitability enrollment . It acceptable visit conduct one day , although do long week . Prior conduct trial related procedure complete explanation ( verbally write ) nature purpose trial give Investigator ( designee ) . The subject request sign date IRB/IEC approve Informed Consent . Subject ’ eligibility trial determine basis inclusion/exclusion criterion , result follow pre-treatment assessment : - Medical history - Complete neurological examination - Complete physical examination - CT Scan/MRI - Vital sign ( blood pressure/heart rate ) - Weight - Height - ECG - Complete chemistry panel , hematology , B12 , folate , RPR , thyroid panel include TSH ( do within last 3 month ) - Urine pregnancy test ( applicable ) - Concomitant medication - Mini Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) - NPI-12 - PSQI - Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale ( MHIS ) Baseline : Visit 2 ( Week 0 ) At begin visit Investigator review test result Visit 1 , include completion eligibility criterion . If patient eligible continue trial , follow assessment carry : • Brief physical examination - Vital sign ( blood pressure/heart rate ) - Weight - Concomitant medication - MMSE - NPI-12 - ADAS-Cog - ADCS-CGIC - FDG-PET* - PSQI - ADCS-ADL inventory - Fluctuation scale - UPDRS - COGDRAS - Dispense medication ( See table ) - AE ’ Titration : Visits 3 ( Week 4 ) , Visit 4 ( Week 8 ) During titration visit ( Visit 3 Visit 4 ) follow assessment do : • Brief physical examination - Vital sign ( blood pressure/heart rate ) • Weight - Concomitant medication - NPI-12 - PSQI - Fluctuation scale - Dispense medication ( See table ) - AE ’ - Drug accountability Maintenance : Visit 5 ( Week 12 ) , Visit 6 ( Week 20 ) Subjects complete titration phase continue 12 week maintenance phase . On clinic visit day subject following assessment : • Brief physical examination • Vital sign ( blood pressure/heart rate ) • Weight • Concomitant medication • MMSE ( Visit 5 ) • NPI-12 • ADAS-Cog ( Visit 5 ) • PSQI • ADCS-ADL inventory ( Visit 5 ) • Fluctuation scale • UPDRS ( Visit 5 ) • COGDRAS ( Visit 5 ) • Dispense medication ( See table ) • AE ’ • Drug Accountability • Efficacy measure ( Visit 5 ) Final Visit : Visit 7 ( Week 24 ) The subject schedule clinic visit perform final assessment . The following assessment carry : • Complete neurological examination • Complete physical examination - Vital sign ( blood pressure/heart rate ) - Weight - ECG - Complete chemistry panel hematology - Urine pregnancy test ( applicable ) - Concomitant medication - Mini Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) - NPI-12 - ADAS-Cog - ADCS-CGIC - FDG-PET* - PSQI - ADCS-ADL inventory - Fluctuation scale - UPDRS - COGDRAS - Drug accountability</detailed_description>
