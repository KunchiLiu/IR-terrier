	<criteria>All following criterion must meet : Liver tumor exceed 5 cm diameter . If size increase , would beneficial many liver lesion present large size give lack symptom large adequate hepatic function albumin &gt; 3.0 , total bilirubin &lt; 3 , INR 1.8 . In case patient know 7 Dose Escalation Study Evaluating Stereotactic Radiosurgery Liver Malignancies suspect cirrhosis , patient must creatinine &lt; 1.5 uncontrolled ascites , encephalopathy , active recent gastrointestinal bleed ( GIB ) . Age &gt; 18 year old Histologically confirm hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( IHCC ) , metastatic adenocarcinoma breast/colon . Metastatic tumor histologic type site origin may include patient life expectancy 6 month great . In case suspect HCC patient know cirrhosis , noninvasive criterion recommend European Association Study Liver Diseases may use . Hypervascular lesion &gt; 2cm alphafetoprotein ( AFP ) &gt; 400ng/mL hypervascular lesion &gt; 2cm least 2 image study . Unresectable disease determine surgeon Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0,1 2 No chemotherapy within 1 month registration No prior radiotherapy liver upper abdominal area Life expectancy &gt; 6 month Patients IHCC HCC distant metastasis eligible study . For colon cancer patient metastatic tumor liver amenable surgical resection due efficacy removal simultaneous lung liver metastasis . Children exclude HCC , IHCC , hepatic metastasis rarely occur age group . Furthermore , treatment require great deal patient cooperation include ability lie still several hour isolated room . No laboratory personnel include .</criteria>
