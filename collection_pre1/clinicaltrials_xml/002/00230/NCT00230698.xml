	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Safety Topiramate Monotherapy Patients With Recently Diagnosed Partial-Onset Seizure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topiramate approve treat epilepsy combination epilepsy drug , approve treat epilepsy sole treatment recently diagnose epilepsy characterize partial-onset seizure . This randomized , double-blind , parallel-group , multicenter trial investigate effectiveness safety topiramate pediatric adult patient recently diagnose epilepsy characterize partial-onset seizure . There four phase trial : Retrospective Baseline , Open-Treatment , Double-Blind , Long-Term Extension . During Retrospective Baseline Phase , eligibilities potential patient evaluate . During Open-Treatment Phase , patient receive 25 milligram [ mg ] daily topiramate ass ability tolerate medication . During Double-Blind Phase , patient randomize high low dose topiramate . Patients continue receive study medication one following occur : ( 1 ) treatment fail ; ( 2 ) 4 month pass since last patient randomize ; ( 3 ) patient withdraws study . Unless withdrawn study , patient may enter Long-Term Extension Phase receive high dose topiramate ( maximum either 1,600mg daily patient &gt; = 14 year age , 24mg/kilogram [ kg ] patient &lt; 14 year age ) patient withdraws study stop sponsor . The study hypothesis topiramate effective well tolerate treat pediatric adult patient recently diagnose epilepsy characterize partial-onset seizure . Open-Treatment : topiramate 25mg daily mouth 7days . Double-Blind : low dose ( 50 mg 25mg daily , depend body weight ) high dose ( 500mg 200mg daily , depend body weight ) 4 month . Long-Term Extension : high dose ( 1600mg 24mg/kg daily , maximum ) various duration .</detailed_description>

None seizures occur cluster pattern During threemonth Retrospective Baseline Phase , patient must receive either standard AntiEpileptic Drug ( AED ) , one AED Patients currently one AED must consider inadequately control Must evidence compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) absence arteriovenous malformation progressive lesion tumor . Patients epilepsy , patient pseudoseizures treatable cause seizures Patients benign rolandic epilepsy Patients progressive degenerative disorder Patients document history generalize tonicclonic status epilepticus three month Retrospective Baseline Phase Patients significant history ( within past two year ) medical disease may impair reliable participation trial necessitate use medication allow protocol Patients unable take medication either independently assistance .</criteria>
