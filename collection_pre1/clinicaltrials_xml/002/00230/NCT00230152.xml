	<brief_summary>The synergistic value fusion physiologic anatomical data describe use several co-registration technique various nuclear medicine procedure morphologic image modality ( single photon emission compute tomography-computed tomography [ SPECT-CT ] , SPECT-magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] , camera-based positron emission tomography [ PET ] -CT PET-CT ) . The researcher hypothesize fusion nuclear medicine ( NM ) CT data acquire sequentially single image session one device clinically superior side-by-side evaluation separately perform imaging test . They hypothesize accurate localization increase radiotracer activity NM procedures improve diagnostic accuracy detection infection subsequently significant impact patient management . The purpose present study assess clinical value new technology fuse image patient undergoing diagnostic nuclear medicine evaluation suspicion infection process .</brief_summary>
