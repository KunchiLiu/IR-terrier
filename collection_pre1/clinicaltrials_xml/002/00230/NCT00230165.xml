	<brief_summary>Blood contains red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet , well fluid portion term plasma . We primarily study blood platelet , sometimes also analyze blood patient red blood cell disorder ( sickle cell disease ) , white blood cell disorder , disorder blood clot factor find plasma . Blood platelet small cell fragment help people stop bleed blood vessel damage . Some individual abnormality blood platelet result function properly . One disorder Glanzmann thrombasthenia . Most patient bleed disorder characterize nosebleed , gum bleeding , easy bruising ( black blue mark ) , heavy menstrual period woman , excessive bleeding surgery trauma . Our laboratory performs advance test platelet function platelet biochemistry . If find evidence genetic disorder may responsible , analyze genetic material ( DNA RNA ) volunteer , possible , close family member identify precise defect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After volunteer family member agree participate , see Outpatient Research Center Principal Investigator another physician . A detailed history obtain , physical examination perform , blood obtain test . Occasionally patient family member request return additional test . If abnormality identify test conduct research laboratory , advise volunteer study repeat laboratory certified conduct test patient .</detailed_description>
