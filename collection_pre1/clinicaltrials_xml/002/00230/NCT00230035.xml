	<brief_summary>Systemic lupus erythematosus , also know lupus SLE , chronic , multisystem , autoimmune disease body 's internal system defense attack normal tissue . This abnormal autoimmune response result damage many part body , especially skin , joint , lung , heart , brain , intestine , kidney . Both genetic environmental risk factor involve development lupus , poorly understood . SLE overall 10-year survival 80 90 % . However , estimate severe lupus respond usual available treatment 50 % mortality rate 10 year . Kidney problem occur 30 % 50 % lupus patient may progress kidney failure . Kidney disease due lupus occur frequently African-Americans Hispanics . Lupus affect many part body cause damage , severe form result death kidney disease ; cardiovascular disease , specifically atherosclerosis ; central nervous system disease ; infection . Currently , single standard therapy treatment severe SLE exists . Usually physicians prescribe aggressive regimen one combination immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatment . This approach therapy form severe SLE derive largely study lupus nephritis . Current treatment , although effective many people , effective patient associate drug-induced morbidity . The design control arm study reflect current status treatment SLE academic setting . Investigators may choose list commonly use currently available immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatment optimize treatment patient , base past treatment history response treatment . Study treatment may consist corticosteroid , cyclophosphamide ( CTX ) , azathioprine , methotrexate , cyclosporine , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , plasmapheresis , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , rituximab , leflunomide . Treatment may change frequently necessary within first year study control manifestation SLE patient . New therapy become available course trial may add list approve medication study . In response absence uniformly effective treatment severe lupus , autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) propose potential therapy . Hematopoietic stem cell immature blood cell develop different blood immune cell body use . Researchers believe reset immune system may stop slow progression disease . The main purpose study compare two way treat SLE : 1 ) high-dose immunosuppressive therapy ( HDIT ) follow HSCT 2 ) currently available immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SLE chronic , multisystem , inflammatory autoimmune disease body 's immune cell wrongly attack tissue . It define presence circulate antinuclear antibody direct nucleosomal DNA-histone complex , native double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) , small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( Sm RNP ) , single-stranded DNA , phospholipids moiety platelet tissue , indicate failure regulatory system involve maintenance immunologic tolerance self-antigens . Despite use currently available therapy , patient experience relapse lupus . Over time , patient develop significant morbidity disease well medication , include glucocorticoid , use treatment . The main purpose study compare two way treat SLE : 1 ) high-dose immunosuppressive therapy ( HDIT ) follow HSCT 2 ) currently available immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy . 1 . One group study participant undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . With treatment , first undergo mobilization , process remove hematopoietic stem cell blood . Then receive high dos chemotherapy suppress abnormal immune system , follow reintroduction purify stem cell re-establish immune system . Medications use mobilize ( i.e. , encourage ) blood cell precursor multiply move bone marrow bloodstream . These precursor ( autologous stem cell ) harvest ( collect ) bloodstream process call apheresis transplant ( infuse ) back patient 's body chemotherapy give . HDIT suppress immune system , reduce effectiveness perhaps eliminate immune cell cause progression SLE . Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) follow HDIT hastens return body 's ability produce blood cell . HDIT HSCT identify potential treatment alternative standard chemotherapy treatment . One group study participant undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . With treatment , first undergo mobilization , process remove hematopoietic stem cell blood . Then receive high dos chemotherapy suppress abnormal immune system , follow reintroduction purify stem cell re-establish immune system . Medications use mobilize ( i.e. , encourage ) blood cell precursor multiply move bone marrow bloodstream . These precursor ( autologous stem cell ) harvest ( collect ) bloodstream process call apheresis transplant ( infuse ) back patient 's body chemotherapy give . HDIT suppress immune system , reduce effectiveness perhaps eliminate immune cell cause progression SLE . Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) follow HDIT hastens return body 's ability produce blood cell . HDIT HSCT identify potential treatment alternative standard chemotherapy treatment . Participants assign first treatment group undergo mobilization CTX granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) begin 2 week randomization . In preparation transplant process . central venous line ( plastic tube ) insert neck chest vein ; tube use administer stem cell medication draw blood . IV CTX , follow G-CSF , give injected skin begin 3 day CTX . G-CSF give 4 7 day , boost body 's production blood precursor cell . These precursor cell collected central venous line apheresis . In process , whole blood collect needle arm vein direct cell-separating machine , white cell separate save . The rest blood return patient needle . Several apheresis procedure require collect enough cell autologous transplant . Within 3 week apheresis stem cell collection , first group 's participant admit hospital undergo five-day conditioning regimen consist IV CTX rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin ( rATG ) . This regimen suppress malfunction immune system prepare patient 's body receive precursor cell previously collect apheresis . The stem cell infuse five-day conditioning regimen . The return precursor cell call autologous stem cell transplantation . During hospitalization specialize team transplant physicians nurse closely monitor participant bone marrow recovers participant well enough discharge . The hospital stay approximately 21 day autologous stem cell transplant . Upon discharge , patient return home follow-up treatment center Weeks 1 3 post-transplantation close monitoring transplant team . Participants also follow study rheumatologist monthly treatment center 30 month . 2 . The group study participant receive immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy prescribe study rheumatologist , base organ system affect prior treatment history . Therapy may include one combination follow treatment : corticosteroid , azathioprine , methotrexate , cyclosporine , MMF , plasmapheresis , IVIG , rituximab , leflunomide . As new drug become available part usual medication treatment SLE , may approve use study . Treatment may change frequently necessary within first year study control manifestation SLE patient . Treatment second group begin 1 week randomization ; patient see monthly treatment center 30 month . Corticosteroid dosage tapering monitor closely ; schedule taper group . To reduce possibility disease flare . slow taper 10 % per month occur first six month . Tapering continue prescribed manner achieve dose equivalent 10 mg/day prednisone less one year post-treatment . All participant monthly follow-up visit 30 month treatment initiate . Study visit include physical exam , clinical assessment , rheumatology evaluation , blood urine collection . Participants ask complete questionnaire assess lupus disease . Neuropsychiatric assessment , echocardiogram , CT scan brain , renal biopsy , pulmonary function test , dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan ( DEXA scan ) , magnetic resonance imagery scan , electromyograph scan ( EMG ) , bone marrow biopsy aspiration lumbar puncture may occur select visit , base individual 's manifestation lupus clinical indication . Participants also receive certain vaccination select visit . Participants contact phone every week throughout study . There extension period patient complete treatment follow-up visit study 's 5-year duration . Participants contact via telephone , e-mail , visit every 3 month assess use concomitant medication immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy corticosteroid . Five treatment center across United States , leader field transplantation rheumatology , participate research study .</detailed_description>
