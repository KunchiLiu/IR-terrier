	<brief_title>Routine Versus Selective Midtrimester Ultrasound Poorly Resourced Setting : Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Routine ultrasound scan second trimester pregnancy substantive benefit , accord result number randomised trial , mostly perform industrialised country . While ultrasound seem prevent fetal death , associate improved detection multiple pregnancy , improve detection congenital abnormality reduce need postterm labour induction . Only one trial , Cape Town , investigate benefit policy routine second trimester ultrasound scan under-resourced setting . This cluster randomise control trial , perform Krugersdorp area South Africa , health service user African , work class dependent government health facility . About 900 low-risk pregnant woman le 24 week gestation recruit , randomise , cluster , either routine scanning scan recourse selective scan clinically indicate . Women follow maternal , fetal neonatal outcome , indices health service utilisation . Important outcome measure need subsequent ultrasound , detection multiple pregnancy , detection congenital abnormality , postterm pregnancy induction , still birth , neonatal morbidity mortality . Data analysis compare outcomes accord whether routine ultrasound scan do , use standard statistical method .</detailed_description>
