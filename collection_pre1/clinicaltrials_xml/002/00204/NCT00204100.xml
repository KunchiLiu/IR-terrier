	<brief_summary>Surface electrical stimulation many year widely use retrain paralysed muscle achieve function stand step . Recently number centre use electrical stimulation leg muscle achieve cycling . During cycle quadriceps hamstring muscle ( thigh muscle ) ( sometimes also gluteal ( buttock ) muscle ) stimulate obtain cycling motion . Stimulation apply use adhesive electrode place surface skin . This form exercise know FES-cycling ( FES = Functional Electrical Stimulation ) . We recently carry pilot study investigate feasibility lower-limb cycling use electrical stimulation . Cycling accomplish use standard recumbent tricycle , adapt purpose FES cycling . Three people complete spinal cord lesion level T7-T10 take part pilot study . The subject able cycle continuously reliably tricycle mount cycle trainer period 1 hour . The subject also able cycle outside distance 3 km . The purpose new study threefold : ( ) We wish develop equipment method recreational cycling stage pre-commercial design specification ; ( ii ) The subject recruit project carry progressive , high-intensity cycle-training programme . In Glasgow , 5 paraplegic subject shall complete training programme , base home . This allow u fully assess feasibility recreational FES-cycling , measure power sustain long period cycling , measure impact training regime quality life ; ( iii ) We determine whether training regime lead significant improvement cardiopulmonary fitness , therefore low risk heart disease , reduction likelihood development pressure sores fracture . We hope type exercise lead general improvement fitness people might use system future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paraplegic Cycling : Improving Health After Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) prevent normal leg exercise lead secondary complication , include cardiopulmonary deconditioning , high incidence pressure sore , bone demineralisation . Wheelchair sport raise fitness level sedentary non-injured people show cycle via functional electrical stimulation , “ FES-cycling ” , . Previous study clinic-based ; limit exercise time inappropriate widespread use . We propose show home-based FES-tricycling recreation , also lead significant health benefit . We train subject home intensively previous study , see whether cycle useful distance . The effect train systematically assess Health Study , : ( ) regularly monitor cardiopulmonary fitness ; ( ii ) make regular tissue measurement related pressure sore susceptibility , ( iii ) measure effect bone density . These health measurement make collaborate clinical centre , i.e . Glasgow , Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries Unit , Southern General Hospital . We also document mobile recumbent tricycle system design specification , preparation commercialisation . The project base around three centre , London , Glasgow Nottwil , bring together interdisciplinary team engineer , exercise scientist , therapist clinician . Aims : Engineering Development . To develop equipment method recreational cycling stage pre-commercial design specification . Training Recreation . To carry progressive , high-intensity FES cycle-training programme . 15 paraplegic subject ( 5 centre ) shall complete training programme , base home . To assess feasibility recreational FES-cycling , measure power sustain long period cycling , measure impact training regime quality life . Health Fitness Study . To assess whether training regime lead significant improvement cardiopulmonary fitness , therefore low risk heart disease , reduction likelihood development pressure sores fracture .</detailed_description>
