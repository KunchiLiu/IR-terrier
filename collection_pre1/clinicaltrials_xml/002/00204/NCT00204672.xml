	<brief_summary>HYPOTHESIS Gastroesophageal reflux major contributor exercise-triggered asthma . Two group patient study : asthma difficulty exertion , without asthma experience difficulty exertion . Both group experience gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) twice less per week . Patients complete treadmill exam determine VO2 max . They undergo pH monitoring exercise 30 minute 65-70 % VO2 max . Subjects give placebo acid suppression pill 12 week . At end 12 week , subject repeat exercise ( 30 minute ) 24-hour pH study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine whether patient exercise-triggered asthma experience GER exercise . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To determine whether exercise-induced GER within subject relate temporally exertional asthma . To evaluate efficacy potent acid suppression proton pump inhibitor suppress exercise-triggered GER asthma subject . METHODS Population evaluate : Exercise-triggered asthmatic – define asthmatic exertion primary exacerbate factor experience less two episode classic gastroesophageal reflux week . These patient randomize three different treatment group : 1 . Placebo BID 2 . 20 mg Aciphex QD placebo QPM 3 . 20 mg Aciphex BID 12 patient study group . DATA pH data - Data collect frequency duration reflux episode ( number episodes percent time esophageal pH le 4.0 ) . This correlated respiratory symptom change spirometry . A symptom index design associate episode reflux bronchospasm occur within 5 minute drop esophageal pH . Exercise Tolerance/Symptoms - comparison make three group regard symptomatology exercise randomization either placebo differing dose Aciphex . Spirometry test – do exercise test . Comparisons baseline follow treatment Symptoms score – overall numerical grade patient quality life number asthmatic episode rescue inhaler use compare baseline 12 week study . STUDY DURATION The asthma database University cover approximately 500 patient . A database search perform identify patient suitable recruitment . Additional recruitment , need , pursue radio advertising . Once study initiate , baseline time therapy 12 week patient . An estimate time necessary complete study 15 month . STATISTICS Exercise trigger asthma well studied respect relationship GER . This study consider pilot study 12 subject per arm . Results study may use power follow study .</detailed_description>
