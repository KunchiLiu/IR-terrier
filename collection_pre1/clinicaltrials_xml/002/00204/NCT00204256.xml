	<detailed_description>This randomize , open label , phase IV study anemic predialysis patient ( Hb 8 11.5 g/dl ) require iron supplementation . The duration study patient approximately 6 month . Patients randomize one two treatment arm admit anemia correction phase ( day 1-43 ) . Treatment intravenous iron sucrose alone versus iron sucrose plus rhEPO . The main treatment evaluation end correction phase : The primary end-point change hemoglobin correction phase . Secondary end-points change ferritin transferrin saturation baseline day 43 . Safety assessment include record adverse event , vital sign , physical examination clinical laboratory test . Incidence severity adverse event compare two different treatment arm .</detailed_description>
