	<detailed_description>Patients 40 79 year old , least three visit primary care physician focus study . Patients recruited letter , co-signed PCP study P1 A second letter send 2 week first . After intake visit , random allocation divide 150 patient 2 arm , one series 3 NP-led group class , usual care . Baseline data , include blood pressure control , foot retinal examination rate , serum lipid , Alc , microalbumin , pneumococcal vaccination , smoke status counseling , ASA lipid medication use assess enrollment completion study . In addition patient complete diabetic knowledge scale , quality life assessment ( SF- 12 ) ADA patient satisfaction survey . Several measure gather chart review oral administration CDC 's BRFSS 2002 diabetes module survey , permit cross validation . Statistical analysis difference proportion ( 2x2 independent sample ) perform use chi-square . Preliminary power analysis ( Power Precision ; Biostat , Englewood , NJ ) suggest adequate power ( use Fisher 's exact test , alpha beta 0.1 , assume reasonably achievable effect size ) least several intermediate outcome . Patients 'group visit ' arm expect attend three 90-minute educational group visit six month , group visit direct nurse practitioner . Patients ask attend three session ( 8-10 patient ) within six month . All patient continue see primary care physician schedule . The focus visit diabetic vascular risk goal , dietary education , self-management skill . A graphical 'Diabetic Health Tracker ' modify Chapin et al provide group class attendees ; intervention may improve vascular risk endpoint . The group visit provider team ability make referral , administer recommend vaccine , adjust medication consultation primary care physician ; NPs also make phone contact class group member visit report result help assure follow-up ; case management function may also improve outcomes . Additional telephone outreach make patient : 1 ) respond 2 recruiting letter , 2 ) see past 12 month order review barrier care . A brief phone screen depression consider give data link depression non-adherence . As burden chronic illness rise along healthcare cost , innovative approach require . Diabetes care repeatedly identify government private payer area focus perhaps even future subject `` pay performance '' . We hope study contribute well diabetic care , long term , improve patient health .</detailed_description>
