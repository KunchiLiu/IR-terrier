	<brief_title>Comparison Esophageal Anorectal Manometry Catheters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty subject abnormal esophageal motility ( 5 subject achalasia , nutcracker esophagus , scleroderma , diffuse esophageal spasm hypertensive LES ) previously refer clinical esophageal motility test contact . These twenty subject must previously undergo esophageal manometry test use standard clinical protocol University Utah motility solid state manometry catheter . After obtain informed consent , twenty subject undergo esophageal manometry use air-filled balloon catheter per standard clinical protocol . Following repeat procedure short one-page questionnaire complete subject motility nurse . Five subject diagnosis incontinence previously refer clinical anorectal motility test contact . These five subject must previously undergo anorectal manometry use standard clinical protocol anorectal manometry study water perfuse anorectal manometry catheter . After obtain informed consent , five subject undergo anorectal manometry use air-filled balloon catheter per standard clinical protocol . Following repeat procedure short one-page questionnaire complete subject motility nurse .</detailed_description>
