	<brief_summary>Results pilot study demonstrate topical imiquimod could clear superficial nodular BCCs . Three phase II dose response study subject nodular BCC ( nBCC ) show histological cure rate imiquimod depend dos apply per week duration treatment . Daily dose 5 time per week application show high total clearance rate 3 time per week dose le frequent dosing . Furthermore , 12 week treatment period result well efficacy result duration 6 week . On hand , local skin reaction increase dos apply per week . So prolonged treatment period 8 12 week application frequence 3 time week seem good compromise efficacy safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Imiquimod 5 % Cream Applied 3x Per Week 8 12 Weeks Low Risk Nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) malignant skin cancer believe develop basal layer epidermis . Ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation primary cause BCC . It induce local systemic immuno-suppression , p53 mutation , pyrimidine covalent dimer desoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) , bcl-2 overexpression . All UV-induced change believe critical pathogenesis BCC . Topical application imiquimod induce local interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) , interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , result cytokine cascade may induce and/or support cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( Th1 ) immune response . Intralesional IFN-alpha show effective treatment BCC . Imiquimod may effective therapy BCC . Results pilot study demonstrate topical imiquimod could clear superficial nodular BCCs . Three phase II dose response study subject nodular BCC ( nBCC ) show histological cure rate imiquimod depend dos apply per week duration treatment . Daily dose 5 time per week application show high total clearance rate 3 time per week dose le frequent dosing . Furthermore , 12 week treatment period result well efficacy result duration 6 week . On hand , local skin reaction increase dos apply per week . So prolonged treatment period 8 12 week application frequence 3 time week seem good compromise efficacy safety . The current safety efficacy study imiquimod 5 % cream treatment nodular basal cell carcinoma ( nBCC ) use composite endpoint include clinical ( visual ) assessment target tumor site histological evaluation excisional surgery take target tumor site primary assessment complete tumor clearance 8 week post treatment .</detailed_description>
