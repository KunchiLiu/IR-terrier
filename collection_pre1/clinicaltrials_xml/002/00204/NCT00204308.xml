	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether addition tenofovir ( TDF ) emtricitabine ( FTC ) standard PMTCT regimen contain single-dose nevirapine ( NVP ) reduce development post-ingestion HIV resistance non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal TDF FTC Reduce NNRTI Resistance Mutations After Intrapartum NVP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-dose intrapartum neonatal nevirapine ( NVP ) , either alone combination short course zidovudine ( ZDV ) widespread use prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission throughout develop world . Though public health benefit overstate , widespread use NVP fashion may come cost . Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) resistance mutation induce least 20 % probably large proportion woman expose NVP fashion . Addition short-course ZDV appear mitigate effect substantially . The full implication NVP resistance mutation yet unknown , though concern may result reduce efficacy NVP NNRTIs long-term , therapeutic regimen . We conduct clinical trial tenofovir ( TDF ) emtricitabine ( FTC ) , market fix dose combination , Truvada â„¢ , reduce NNRTI-resistance post-delivery set NVP without ZDV PMTCT . TDF FTC Category B drug approve use pregnancy . They several characteristic make ideal candidate drug use conjunction NVP , include long intracellular half-lives establish safety profile among adult HIV treatment . Women enrol 28 38 week gestation . As part normal PMTCT service , may choose NVP-boosted ZDV single dose NVP PMTCT ; We anticipate ( ~80 % ) choose former . At arrival delivery , randomize receive either two study drug ( intervention ) drug ( control ) . A total 400 woman randomize , follow , along infant , 6 month .</detailed_description>
