	<detailed_description>The goal study investigate epidemiology natural history childhood-onset diabetes , whether autoimmune , non-autoimmune , mixed etiology affect probands relative . The following hypothesis frame research question address : Hypothesis 1 . Diabetes occur youth derives spectrum etiologic process , insulinopenia autoimmune type 1 obesity-related , insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes . A subset child develop diabetes combination 2 major etiologic pathway , autoimmune ß-cell destruction aggravate presence insulin resistance relate genetic susceptibility , obesity and/or physical inactivity . A fraction young patient unclassifiable onset due severe symptomatology ambiguity measure ß-cell function . This pose research challenge misclassification disease , well clinical difficulty potentially inappropriate treatment … Since patient draw city-wide registry , cluster genetic behavioral risk factor systematically identify without selection bias inherent case series clinic-based study . Research question : 1 . Is feasible distinguish type 1 early-onset type 2 diabetes diagnosis ? Which demographic , clinical , family characteristic useful ? 2 . Is risk develop diabetes among sibling early-onset type 2 mixed case equivalent sibling type 1 patient ? Which characteristic predictive risk ? Hypothesis 2 . Changes epidemiologic parameter childhood diabetes past 2 decade directly relate change prevalence risk factor type 1 type 2 diabetes , include obesity , physical inactivity , perinatal exposure . Research question : 1 . Is change incidence childhood diabetes occur uniformly across age- , sex- ethnic stratum ? 2 . Are secular change type 2 incidence rate continue , occur age- , sex- ethnic stratum ? Hypothesis 3 . A complex interplay heritable , behavioral , treatment factor accelerate delay development chronic diabetes complication . It particularly compel understand process young patient , year productive life risk . … Recent observation indicate feature metabolic syndrome , glycemic control , potent risk factor macrovascular complication . Familial aggregation trait may play role determine risk chronic complication among young people diabetes . Research question : 1 . Do young people diabetes demonstrate sign symptom early complication great insulin resistance characteristic distinguish patient free complication , control disease duration metabolic control ? 2 . Do young patient early signs/symptoms complication parent elevate cardiovascular disease risk factor , patient free chronic complication , control disease duration metabolic control ?</detailed_description>
