	<brief_summary>Treadmill therapy potential improve physical fitness voluntary function incomplete-lesion spinal cord injure ( SCI ) patient . However , offer rehabilitation strategy , evidence must gather support effectiveness . Present method use determine efficacy treadmill train provide accurate mean monitoring change physical fitness exercise , accurately measure change voluntary muscle function may occur train intervention . We therefore currently recruit subject study investigate feasibility new method monitoring improvement physical fitness walking treadmill . We also aim develop method monitor change voluntary muscle strength . The bone density legs also measure determine improvement occur follow training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treadmill therapy potential improve cardiopulmonary fitness , voluntary function , low limb bone density incomplete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) patient . However , offer clinically rehabilitation strategy evidence must gather support effectiveness . The efficacy FES−assisted walk incomplete SCI individual , overground treadmill , previously assess monitoring walk speed , stride length , endurance , cadence , physiological oxygen cost , % body weight support ( treadmill ) , perform observational gait analysis manual muscle test ( 1,2,3,4,5,6 ) . However , method provide mean measuring change fitness accurately monitoring improvement voluntary muscle function . At present appropriate method test person 's cardiopulmonary fitness treadmill lack . Previously , incremental exercise test carry maintain constant inclination increase speed linearly . However , speed increase linearly likely increase fast pace . Therefore test become measure subject 's ability move legs quickly and/or efficiently enough , rather metabolic factor . If steep gradient choose constant inclination high initial metabolic cost result , limit test time . Another common method use maintain constant speed increase sine angle inclination . The problem method test low speed select steep gradient result level tolerance reach , high speed select high initial metabolic cost . These problem address recent paper Porszasz et al. , 2003 ( 7 ) . They demonstrate increase walk speed linearly treadmill gradient curvilinearly , linear increase work rate occur subject fatigue moderate speed . If protocol could adapt use incomplete SCI patient would provide accurate mean test change cardiopulmonary function may result treadmill train . It recently record dynamometry ( rather manual muscle score ) use assess change voluntary function incomplete SCI patient ( 8 ) . Therefore employ approach study . Following spinal injury rapid decline bone mineral density increase risk fracture follow minor trauma . Therefore also measure bone density epiphyses shaft tibia femur determine form training lead change bone mineral density patient population . By demonstrate treadmill train improve cardiopulmonary fitness individual incomplete SCI , voluntary strength , bone mineral density , help provide evidence form rehabilitation worthwhile . By increase cardiopulmonary fitness reduce risk develop cardiovascular disease , major problem population due sedentary lifestyle . If demonstrate improve voluntary function would suggest quality life ability carry activity daily live may also improve . Improving bone density would consequently reduce risk fracture . Therefore result study contribute quest try improve overall health functional ability patient population .</detailed_description>
