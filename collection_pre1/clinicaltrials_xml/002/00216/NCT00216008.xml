	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find effectiveness experimental combination Docetaxel , Cisplatin , radiation therapy administer prior surgical removal esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomic Study Docetaxel Cisplatin , Followed Docetaxel , Cisplatin Irradiation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seek determine safety efficacy ( latter base pathologic response rate , three- five-year survival rate ) three-phase multi-modality approach adenocarcinoma esophagus gastroesophageal junction . This study also aim retrospectively determine specific tumor gene array profile would predict pathologic complete response . Study schema follow . Patients first stag , next receive induction Docetaxel Cisplatin day 1 22 , patient restaged , next undergo radiation therapy combine Cisplatin Docetaxel approximately day 42 thorough 84 , patient restaged , finally surgery approximately day 100 150 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histological cytological confirm esophageal adenocarcinoma adenocarcinoma gastroesophageal junction ( diagnosis render gastroenterology endoscopist , refers tumor junction esophagus stomach , &gt; 50 % tumor mass diaphragm ) . Tumors must great 2cm extension cardia . Stage T2N0M0 , T3N0M0 , T13N1M0 , T13N01M1a determine image study endoscopic ultrasound stag . M1a disease ( celiac nodal metastasis ) permit eligibility criterion meet . Any lesion suspicious metastasis biopsied ( either tru cut fine needle aspiration ) prove eligibility . The subject deem appropriate surgical candidate one surgical subinvestigators ( ie . Not T4 ) . No medical comorbidity make patient surgical candidate . Subject must 18 year old Subject must understand consent willing give write informed consent participate investigational protocol , tumor biopsy perform research purpose time stag endoscopic ultrasound ( clinically require care ) , portion resection specimen subject experimental laboratory analysis ECOG performance status &lt; 1 ( Karnofsky &gt; 80 % ; see Appendix A ) . Subjects must adequate caloric intake , determine nutrition evaluation register dietician . Nutrition intake may enteral , hyperalimentation enteral feeding tube , parenteral nutrition . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL ; absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL ; platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL ; hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl ; Creatinine clearance ( estimate CockroftGault equation ) &gt; 50mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Hepatic : Total bilirubin must &lt; ULN ; AST ALT alkaline phosphatase must less 2.5 x ULN . Has negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior initiation therapy ( female patient childbearing potential ) . Patients may receive investigational agent . Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events version 3 ( CTCAEv3 ) great grade 1 peripheral neuropathy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , symptomatic coronary artery disease cardiac arrhythmia well controlled medication ) myocardial infarction within last 12 month . Pregnant nursing woman exclude study . Women / men childbearing potential use reliable appropriate contraceptive method . Woman childbearing potential either positive pregnancy test baseline . ( Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential ) . Patients agree continue contraception 30 day date last study drug administration Patients history severe hypersensitivity reaction docetaxel , cisplatin , drug formulate polysorbate ( Tween ) 80 . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction cisplatin docetaxel agent administer study . Major surgery within 4 week start study treatment , without complete recovery . History clinically significant interstitial lung disease and/or pulmonary fibrosis . Treatment carcinoma within last five year , except cure nonmelanoma skin treat insitu cervical cancer . Clinical radiographic evidence tracheobronchial fistula invasion aorta ( i.e . T4 disease ) .</criteria>
