	<brief_summary>This study design primarily establish efficacy estimate resource utilization . The short-term hypothesis dose capecitabine ( 825 mg/m2 twice/day 5 day per week ) course radiation therapy efficacious locally advanced , non-metastatic rectosigmoid carcinoma improve resectability . The long-term working hypothesis 3-D CRT combine potentiate additive effect capecitabine one hop see improved durable tumor response survival acceptable toxicity . In addition , expect simplicity use oral agent ( capecitabine ) associate reduced cost resource utilization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine ( Xeloda ) Radiation Patients With Rectosigmoid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive combine treatment 3-D external radiation therapy plus Xeloda® . External Radiation Therapy pelvis , low abdomen rectal area give day , five day week , Monday Friday , five six week use three dimensional technique . Xeloda® ( oral chemotherapy ) pill take mouth . This medication take course radiation therapy day radiation treatment give . Xeloda pills take twice daily begin first day radiation therapy treatment end last day radiation therapy treatment . The following test procedure part regular medical treatment ( standard care ) disease also require study : - physical examination , sometimes include digital rectal exam - blood test include ( blood ) pregnancy test do start treatment patient woman able child . - urinalysis - ECG ( heart trace ) - chest X-ray - ultrasound , produce picture rectal area use sound waves· CT scan pelvis abdomen Some people may need surgery , others may require chemotherapy , others may require additional treatment depend tumor respond Xeloda® radiation therapy treatment . Patients also ask complete two questionnaire fatigue , general quality life , bowel functioning .</detailed_description>
