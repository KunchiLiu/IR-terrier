	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Epoetin Alfa Hemoglobin Levels Blood Transfusions Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer patient often experience anemia due disease , chemotherapy , . Quality life also affect , due part tiredness associate anemia . Previous study epoetin alfa suggest early intervention epoetin alfa result higher hemoglobin level low incidence red blood cell transfusion achieve delay intervention . This randomized , open-label , explorative , sequential study evaluate effect early treatment epoetin alfa determine impact hemoglobin value need red blood cell transfusion well safety epoetin alfa use prevention anemia chemotherapy adult patient cancer . During current course chemotherapy , patient receive either early treatment epoetin alfa standard treatment epoetin alfa ( epoetin alfa administer hemoglobin &lt; =10 g/dL ) , addition best standard care . Best standard care chemotherapy may include red blood cell transfusion , white cell growth factor , folic acid , iron supplementation , need . Effectiveness determine number patient receive allogenic blood transfusion study change hemoglobin 3 4 week , 8 9 week , 12 week , end treatment period . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , abnormal clinical laboratory test , vital sign ) perform throughout study . The study hypothesis cancer patient receive chemotherapy receive early treatment epoetin alfa high hemoglobin level fewer red blood cell transfusion cancer patient receive chemotherapy receive standard treatment epoetin alfa . This study conduct Netherlands enroll European patient generally well-tolerated . Epoetin alfa injection ( 40,000 unit ) skin week either within 7 day start first chemotherapy cycle day hemoglobin &lt; =10 g/dL . Patients receive epoetin alfa current course chemotherapy 24 week . Dose may adjust .</detailed_description>
