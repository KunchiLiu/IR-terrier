	<brief_summary>Our long-term working hypothesis 3-D radiation combine effect capecitabine one hop see improved durable tumor response survival acceptable toxicity . The primary objective determine maximum tolerate dose capecitabine use along 3-D conformal radiation therapy . Capecitabine take mouth day radiation . The total daily dose take two divided dos approximately 12 hour apart , within 30 minute eat , ideally breakfast even meal . The overall total number patient expect participate study could high 30 depend treatment tolerate . The first group ( 3-6 patient ) study receive drug ( Xeloda® ) 600mg/m² ( level 1 ) radiation . If first group well , second group patient study ( 3-6 patient ) receive 825 mg/m² ( level 2 ) radiation . If second group well , third group receive 1,000 mg/m² ( level 3 ) radiation . If first dose level 600mg/m² NOT tolerate , reduce dose 500mg/m² enroll another 3-6 patient low dose . After high tolerate dose identify , 12 additional patient treat dose test safety treatment well understand effect treatment disease patient . The following test procedure part regular medical treatment ( standard care ) disease also require study . - physical examination - blood test include pregnancy test - urinalysis - ECG ( heart trace ) - chest X-ray - CT scan abdomen Follow-up visit do 1 month radiation , 3 month later , every 3 month 2 year .</brief_summary>
