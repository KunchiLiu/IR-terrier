	<detailed_description>Stroke third lead cause death United States develop country major source disability , often leading hospitalization . Prognosis regain ability walk good , 64 % initially dependent walk regain independence three month . However , many gait abnormality persist . Reduced hip , knee ankle excursion swing among persistent gait abnormality contribute poor inefficient limb clearance . This generally refer `` foot drop '' , since foot drop drag along ground swing phase . Swing phase abnormality result decreased velocity , limited endurance increase risk fall . These factor limit mobility independence community . Therefore , intervention warrant . The conventional approach address poor swing limb function , specifically , insufficient ankle dorsiflexion , prescription ankle-foot orthosis ( AFO ) . An AFO commonly limit ankle plantarflexion enhance limb clearance swing . An alternative approach stimulate ankle dorsiflexors electrically swing phase reproduce motion , long perform volitionally . The WalkAide new foot drop stimulator . This small , self-contained device attache leg knee . The WalkAide contain number patented feature , include tilt sensor measure orientation leg respect vertical . When leg tilt back end stance , stimulation common peroneal nerve initiate . This produce flexion ankle joint ( flexion reflex elicit ) leg clear ground swing . When leg tilt forward end swing phase , stimulus terminate . The electrode attach inside cuff mold leg reproducible positioning day day . The device also design operation do single hand , since hemiparesis may prevent subject use hand . Because enhanced feature , WalkAide anticipate increase walk speed improve quality life .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Adults age 18 year old 2 . Diagnosed cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) within last 365 day 3 . Inadequate dorsiflexion swing phase gait , result inadequate limb clearance 4 . Medically stable six month prior recent episode stroke result hemiplegia hemiparesis foot drop 5 . Medical clearance attend physician participate study 6 . Expectation current medication maintain without drastic change least six month 7 . Adequate stability ankle stance ( stimulation ) 8 . Adequate cognitive communication function give inform consent , understand train instruction , use device give adequate feedback 9 . Ability ambulate without assistive device ( assistance ) least 10 meter 1 . Lower motor neuron injury inadequate response stimulation 2 . History fall great week prior CVA 3 . Severe cardiac disease myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure demand pacemaker ( electrical stimulator ) 4 . Fixed ankle contracture five degree plantarflexion knee extend 5 . Moderate normal ambulation velocity ( great 1.2 m/s ) 6 . Unable operate device safely self caregiver assistance available 7 . Need AFO stance control foot , ankle and/or knee 8 . Comorbid condition unlikely survive one year 9 . Preexisting history seizure disorder prior recent episode CVA 10 . Preexisting pathology result significant disruption alignment function low extremity 11 . Morbid obesity limit subject 's response stimulation due adipose tissue [ BMI &gt; 40 ] 12 . Excessive dysesthetic pain secondary neurological involvement 13 . Severe hypertonicity result need involve orthotic strategy pharmacological intervention ( e.g . Botox )</criteria>
