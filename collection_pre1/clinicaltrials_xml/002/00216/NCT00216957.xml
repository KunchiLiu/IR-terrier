However , heart lung machine believe responsible many side effect complication see patient follow CABG surgery . The organ commonly affect brain , blood constituent , lung kidney . In last year , stabilise device develop allow CABG operation perform safely without use heart lung machine . Our hypothesis CABG do without heart lung machine may better tolerate patient result low morbidity , increase functional outcome shorter hospital length stay . Enrolment trial 1998 2003 include 300 patient . The last patient enrol June 2003 . The initial result study suggest excellent result obtain technique contrary others advantage could demonstrate in-hospital outcome patient perform without cardiopulmonary bypass ( Legare et al .
