	<brief_title>Safety Study Rituximab ( Rituxan速 ) Chronic Urticaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rituximab ( Rituxan速 ) recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody bind molecule ( CD20 ) present surface B lymphocytes . The product approve treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma investigate treatment number autoimmune disease include rheumatoid arthritis ( Edwards 2004 ) lupus ( Looney 2004 , Leandro 2002 ) . As rheumatoid arthritis study , medication administer study series two intravenous infusion give 2 week apart . Many case chronic urticaria ( hive ) though drive autoimmune mechanism ( Kaplan 2002 , Grattan 2002 ) . It hypothesis interfere autoimmune process , potentially decrease level autoantibody interfere mechanism cause basophil mast cell activation , improvments sign symptom see . Given effectiveness demonstrate Rituximab autoimmune condition , conduct pilot open label investigation 15 patient chronic urticaria determine safety effectiveness Rituximab disease . All patient receive medication ; placebo group study . Rituximab currently indicate treatment condition however . We evaluate safety Rituximab 15 patient urticaria well study antibody level cellular function . We also evaluate clinical outcome itch score , sleep disturbance , quality life . After receivng Rituximab treatment , begin taper antihistamine medication use control urticaria symptom .</detailed_description>
