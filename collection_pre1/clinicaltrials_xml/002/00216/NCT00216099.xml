	<brief_summary>Docetaxel-based therapy show prolong survival first-line therapy patient hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) , become standard care . The beneficial effect therapy HRPC may diverse include reduction tumor bulk ( measurable ) , reduction prostate-specific antigen PSA , reduction symptom ( particularly pain ) , stabilization disease . Clear reduction tumor bulk PSA may provide objective evidence treatment effect , stabilization disease may clinically meaningful patient actively progress prior start therapy . Pemetrexed show broad array activity many disease think non-responsive chemotherapy second-line setting . This trial design assess efficacy , safety , tolerability , pharmacogenetics pemetrexed single agent subject HRPC whose disease progress follow one prior taxane-based chemotherapy regimen HRPC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . - Pemetrexed 500mg/m2 administer intravenously approximately 10-minutes Day 1 21-day cycle . - Folic Acid ( 350-1000 mcg . PO daily ) take patient reduce toxicity . At least 5 daily dos folic acid must take 7-day period precede first dose pemetrexed , dose continue full course therapy 21 day last dose pemetrexed . - Vitamin B12 ( 1000 Âµg ) administer intramuscular injection week precede first dose pemetrexed every 3 cycle thereafter . Subsequent vitamin B12 injection may give day pemetrexed . Performance Status : Karnofsky Performance Status 70-100 Life expectancy &gt; 12 week Hematopoietic : - Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500/mm3 - Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 - Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Hepatic : - Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X upper limit normal ( unless due Gilbert 's disease ) - Alkaline phosphatase Alanine Transanimase ( ALT ) ( SGPT ) &lt; 3 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; may &lt; 5 X ULN patient liver metastasis . Alkaline phosphatase may value patient bone metastasis . Renal : - Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min base standard Cockroft Gault formula Cardiovascular : - No congestive heart failure require therapy New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class II great active angina know myocardial infarction within 12 month prior study - No unstable angina , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , unstable symptomatic arrhythmia require medication within 6 month prior register protocol therapy - Subjects chronic atrial arrhythmia , i.e. , atrial fibrillation , paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia , control hypertension eligible Pulmonary : - Not specify</detailed_description>
