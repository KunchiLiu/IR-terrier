	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Dexmedetomidine ICU Patients Requiring Continuous Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditional agent benzodiazepine propofol long used sedate critically ill patient . Unfortunately , agent serious disadvantage may negative impact patient outcome . These disadvantage include respiratory depression , prolong mechanical ventilation , paradoxical agitation , myocardial depression , hypotension , tachyphylaxis , physical dependence , unpredictable duration action follow long term infusion . Additionally , concomitant use opioid analgesic often required ICU patient achieve adequate level pain relief , may also prolong awaken possibly increase respiratory depression . Dexmedetomidine may offer new treatment option remedy many deficiency traditional sedative . This agent would provide accurate , titratable sedation analgesia without concurrent respiratory depression accumulation common agent . It may permit great patient interaction due reduce impairment cognition may reduce risk associated opioids due analgesia spar property . Although drug may important benefit ICU patient require sedation great 24 hour , dexmedetomidine currently approve long-term usage .</detailed_description>

Of childbearing potential pregnant confirm negative serum pregnancy test time screening , practice one follow method birth control : oral parenteral contraceptive three month prior study drug administration , vasectomized partner , abstinence sexual intercourse . 3 . Subject initially intubate mechanically ventilate , plan imminent intubation mechanical ventilation , sedation anticipate required mechanical ventilation , mechanical ventilation anticipate continue least 72 hour . 4 . Subject subject 's legally authorize representative voluntarily sign date informed consent form , approve applicable Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , nature study explain subject subject 's legally authorize representative opportunity ask question . The informed consent must sign study specific procedure perform . 5 . Subject sedate within Richmond AgitationSedation Scale ( RASS ) range 2 +1 time initiation study drug 1 . Subject intubate great 96 hour prior initiation study drug ( thus , attainment consent , screen evaluation , randomization must complete 96th hour postintubation , actual initiation study drug infusion may start end 96 hour window ) . 2 . Subject serious central nervous system pathology/trauma , per clinical judgment Investigator , preclude responsiveness survival . 3 . Subject opiate , benzodiazepine , dexmedetomidine contraindicate , know suspect serious allergy drug might administer course study . 4 . Subject alpha2 agonist contraindicate . 5 . Subject require neuromuscular block agent study use intubation . 6 . Subject require epidural spinal analgesia study . 7 . Subject meet follow cardiovascular criterion : Acute unstable angina ( define current hospital stay ) . Suspicion acute myocardial infarction . Considered leave ventricular ejection fraction le 30 % . Decision exclude predicate Investigator 's opinion , may base combination acute presentation , recently perform diagnostic study , history suggest poor cardiac function . Pulmonary congestion noncardiac origin mild congestive failure primarily attributable etiology poor ventricular function exclusion criterion . Heart rate &lt; 50 bpm prior infusion start . Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg prior infusion start . Conduction abnormalities except 1st degree AV block ratecontrolled atrial fibrillation ; subject functional pacemaker capacity may enrol . 8 . Subject hospitalize primarily due trauma and/or burn , receive general anaesthesia within 24 hour prior start study drug infusion , anticipate require general anaesthesia within 24 hour start infusion . 9 . Subject participate trial experimental drug within 30 day prior enrollment study , ever enrol study . 10 . Subject unable undergo procedure require protocol . 11 . Subject laboratory result indicate presence liver disease consistent ChildPugh score &gt; 9 ( Grade C ) . 12 . Subject acute hepatitis , history presence chronic hepatitis , and/or positive result Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Test . 13 . Subject require dialysis ( eg , hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis , Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis [ CVVHD ] ) . 14 . Subject know , uncontrolled seizure disorder . 15 . Subject , per Investigator 's judgment , know suspected physical psychological dependence abuse drug , alcohol . 16 . Subject know psychiatric illness could confound normal response sedative treatment . 17 . Subject incarcerate . 18 . Subject terminally ill life duration expectancy ≤60 day . 19 . Subject condition factor , Investigator 's opinion , might increase risk subject .</criteria>
