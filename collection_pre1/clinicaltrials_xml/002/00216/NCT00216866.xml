	<brief_summary>The purpose study obtain estimate catheter survival set upper extremity deep vein thrombosis ( UEDVT ) patient treat dalteparin warfarin . Anticoagulation dalteparin warfarin patient UEDVT secondary central venous catheter patient active malignancy effective therapy quantify success catheter preservation . A prolonged line salvage rate without recurrence UEDVT improve management cancer patient develop upper extremity deep venous thrombosis set central venous ( CV ) catheter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Catheter Study : Central Venous Catheter Survival Cancer Patients Using Low Molecular Weight Heparin ( Dalteparin ) Treatment Deep Vein Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) serious disorder annual incidence approximately 0.1 % increase age 1 % elderly . Deep venous thrombosis upper extremity ( UEDVT ) estimate constitute 1-5 % case DVT . The therapy UEDVT standardized.Therapeutic option include anticoagulation unfractionated heparin follow warfarin , treatment thrombolytic agent , thrombectomy . Recently , treatment low molecular weight heparin show safe effective treatment patient verify UEDVT . In patient cancer , treatment UEDVT associate central venous catheter even less standardize . Some group advocate removal catheter sole treatment DVT , others remove catheter treat DVT . A major disadvantage remove line often re-insertion opposite limb require avoid disruption chemotherapeutic treatment . This reinsertion put patient risk thrombosis pulmonary embolism . Another therapy treatment systemic thrombolytic therapy . The disadvantage thrombolytic therapy person cancer high risk major bleeding dos use . A treatment regimen adopt London Health Sciences Centre , others across Canada , leave catheter place treat DVT low molecular weight heparin warfarin . This regimen believe halt progression thrombus , prevent embolism allow natural thrombolytic mechanism work effectively . By leave central line situ appropriately treat thrombosis disruption delivery life-prolonging life-saving treatment form chemotherapy . Preliminary data collect past 24 month London Health Sciences Centre ; result suggest approach treatment prove beneficial patient . Thirteen ( 13 ) patient cancer UEDVT associate central venous catheter treat dalteparin warfarin intention leave central line situ . Of 13 , 1 patient line remove 3 day peripheral hospital recommendation . The UEDVT treat successfully without need line removal 9 ( 75 % ) remain 12 patient . Two ( 2 ) 12 line remove 1 week 1 line remove 4 week due worsen symptoms UEDVT . Therefore , UEDVT common less benign disease previously report generally arise presence recognizable risk factor central venous catheter cancer . Treatment UEDVT dalteparin warfarin treat thrombosis preserve central venous access continue use . Hence , need additional catheter subsequent risk bilateral UEDVT minimized . Result CLOT ( Clot Cancer ) Trial show superiority treatment dalteparin 6 month compare conventional treatment short-term dalteparin extend warfarin cancer patient acute symptomatic DVT PE . Extended anticoagulant therapy may beneficial patient UEDVT well , however , currently estimate clinical outcome either conventional ( dalteparin follow warfarin ) extend therapy dalteparin patient population .</detailed_description>
