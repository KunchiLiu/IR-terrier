	<brief_title>A Study Treatment Success Changing From Olanzapine Long-acting Injectable Risperidone ( RISPERDAL® CONSTA™ )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although many schizophrenia patient currently take oral antipsychotic medication , estimate 75 % difficulty adhere daily oral regimen . Long-acting injectable formulation may eliminate need daily medication enhance patient compliance treatment regimen . In addition , transition different antipsychotic drug time necessary step clinical management patient schizophrenia due different reason , include insufficient response poor tolerability . This open-label , non-randomized study formulation risperidone ( RISPERDAL® CONSTA™ ) ( coated microspheres ) inject muscle week interval 6 month patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . During first 3 week , oral olanzapine treatment continue provide therapy risperidone long-acting injectable reach effective drug level . The oral olanzapine treatment taper within 1 week one group patient within 3 week another group . Assessments effectiveness include Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , overall severity illness measure Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) scale , quality life evaluate SF-36 questionnaire . Safety evaluation include incidence adverse event study Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale ( ESRS ) , clinical laboratory test ( biochemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) , physical exam , include body weight , specify interval . The study hypothesis change treatment every 2 week long-acting risperidone provide maintain effectiveness patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder generally well-tolerated Risperidone , long-acting formulation intramuscular injection ( 25 milligram [ mg ] ) every 2 week 6 month . Investigator may adjust dosage 37.5mg 50mg ( maximum ) supplement risperidone injection risperidone tablet ( 2mg maximum ) , accord symptom treatment response .</detailed_description>
