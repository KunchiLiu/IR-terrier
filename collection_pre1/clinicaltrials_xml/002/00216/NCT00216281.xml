	<brief_summary>This randomize , placebo-controlled study ass efficacy safety ATX augmentation CLZ treatment cognitive symptom schizophrenia . A total sample size 126 subject diagnose schizophrenia treat antipsychotic clozapine undergo genotyping . These subject initial assessment four week regular follow-up assessment total period 52 week . These subject randomize continued treatment CLZ augmentation ATX Placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Clozapine Augmented Atomoxetine Versus Clozapine Augmented Placebo Patients With Chronic Resistant Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study scientifically explore potential pharmacogenetic application mean predict clinical efficacy safety treatment clozapine atomoxetine treatment resistant schizophrenic population . The principle enzyme involve metabolism clozapine CYP1A2 minor contribution CYP2D6 . However , subject stable dose clozapine continue dosage throughout study . On hand , half number subject randomize augmentation atomoxetine since atomoxetine predominantly metabolize CYP2D6 contribution CYP2C19 , focus genetic variation CYP2D6 CYP2C19 . The goal study associate atomoxetine metabolite drug concentration clinical efficacy development clinical adverse drug reaction determine whether clinical outcome ( efficacy ADRs ) experience follow drug ingestion likely see patient manifest CYP2D6 and/or CYP2C19 polymorphism ( ) . Other indication pharmacogenetics patient care , relevance therapeutic drug monitoring , augmentation strategy dosage guideline may generate experience result study . Primary Objectives 1 . To compare effect combination CLZ+ATX cognitive function patient schizophrenia , measure change Composite Cognitive index derive battery compose standardized cognitive test , Brief Assessment Cognition Schizophrenia.. 2 . A total sample 126 subject diagnose schizophrenia treat antipsychotic clozapine , recruit participate study . All 126 subject undergo genetic test obtain informed consent , 31 know mutation CYP2D6 include gene duplication deletion well , two mutation CYP2C19 . Secondary Objectives 1 . Determine concentration atomoxetine two prominent metabolite ( 4-hydroxyatomoxetine , N-desmethylatomoxetine ) end week one four week initiate therapy LC/MS/MS analysis . 2 . Obtain weekly complete blood count CLZ level screen , end week one week four . 3 . Clinically evaluate patient document adverse drug reaction occur start treatment atomoxetine 4 . To examine effect combination CLZ+ATX psychopathology measure Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) score ( PANSS Total , PANSS Positive , PANSS Negative ) , Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale 5 . To examine effect combination CLZ+ATX measure social cognition : Penn Emotional Recognition Facial Memory Tests . 6 . To compare effect combination CLZ+ATX weight change baseline . 7 . To examine effect combination CLZ+ATX daily function measure NOSIE . 8 . To examine effect combination CLZ+ATX extrapyramidal sign motor symptom measure Barnes Akathesia Rating Scale ( BARS ) , Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) , Simpson-Angus Scale ( SAS ) . 9 . To evaluate safety combination CLZ+ATX measure treatment-emergent adverse event change vital sign , clinical laboratory analytes , electrocardiogram .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis Schizophrenia meet diagnostic criterion define Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( 4th edition , text revision ) ( DSMIVTR ) , APA 2000 ) . 2 . Adult ( 1865 ) males female confirm primary diagnosis schizophrenia . 3 . Stable symptom determine score 70 less PANSS . 4 . Women child bear potential must use medically accept mean contraception . 5 . Adequate cognitive function ( IQ &gt; 65 ) assess WRAT3 , level understanding sufficient perform test examination require protocol . 6 . Considered reliable . 7 . Stable clozapine treatment . Criteria stability define follow : Patients take oral clozapine daily last 4 week ( change clozapine dose 4 week prior screen ) . Patients must require chronic addons take `` need '' antipsychotic antidepressant medication last four week control agitation , behavioral disturbance , primary psychiatric symptomatology . There must significant change level care require , cause worsen schizophrenia last four week . For example escalation lesser great intensity treatment ER visit . Patients must take additional psychotropic medication include health food supplement judge investigator likely central nervous system activity ( example , St. John 's Wort , ginkgo biloba leaf , melatonin ) . Patients must receive depot antipsychotic within past 8 week day . 8 . Each patient must judge competent able understand nature study must sign informed consent document prior participation study . 9 . Patients must able swallow medication . 1 . Clinically significant organic disease , opinion investigator , would put patient significant risk study procedure interfere data interpretability . This include hepatic ( specifically degree jaundice ) , renal , gastroenterologic , respiratory , cardiovascular ( include ischemic heart disease ) , endocrinologic , neurologic , immunologic condition . 2 . Potentially serious unstable medical condition likely require exclude medication significant treatment course treatment . 3 . Patients tolerate atomoxetine past history clinically significant adverse effect ( ) prior treatment atomoxetine . 4 . Patients tolerate oral CLZ past experience significant adverse effect ( ) past . 5 . History nonresponse clozapine ( treatment refractory ) define unambiguous lack improvement despite contiguous adequate trial least 14 week treatment . 6 . Clozapine blood level outside optimum CLZ plasma level 350 400 ng/ml . 7 . Women pregnant , breastfeeding , refuse use adequate birth control . 8 . Significant risk suicidal behavior pose imminent significant threat others , time screen . 9 . History alcohol drug dependence ( except nicotine caffeine ) meet DSM IV criterion , within past six month history drug alcohol abuse within past 30 day . Patients history cannabis use recreational purpose may enrol opinion PI , drug use pattern primarily relate psychiatric condition diagnosis . 10 . Have abnormal blood pressure opinion investigator . 11 . Electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) outside normal limit . 12 . Abnormal clinical laboratory test result outside normal range . 13 . History agranulocytosis ( absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 mm3 ) . 14 . Uncorrected hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism abnormal thyroidstimulating hormone ( TSH ) concentration . Patients previously diagnose hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism treat stable dose thyroid supplement least 3 month , medically appropriate TSH concentration , clinically euthyroid allow . 15 . History clinically significant head injury . 16 . History allergic reaction clozapine atomoxetine condition could aggravate treatment medication ( example , narrowangle glaucoma , urinary retention hesitancy ) . 17. one seizure without clear resolve etiology . 18 . Hearing visual impairment severe enough interfere performance cognitive test . 19 . Patients take monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) drug ( example Nardil™ , Parnate™ , Eutron™ depression ) tryptophan within last 2 week prior screen . 20 . History electroconvulsive therapy within previous year . 21 . History mental retardation . 22 . Have gradelevel equivalent score le 8th grade determine WRAT3 .
