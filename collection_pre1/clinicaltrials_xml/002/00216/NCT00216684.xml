	<brief_title>Phase III Clinical Trial Fentanyl Transdermal Matrix Patch , Management Chronic Intractable Pain- Assessment Effectiveness , Safety Pharmacokinetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fentanyl transdermal matrix patch narcotic analgesic agent . Compared exist reservoir-type Durotep® Patch , fentanyl transdermal matrix patch liable leakage drug solution contain alcohol , become cause skin irritation . Also new formulation become available small dose 12.5mg/hr small Durotep® Patch 25mg/hr . While Durotep® Patch currently indicate cancer pain Japan , clinical trial plan ass effectiveness , safety fentanyl transdermal matrix patch Japanese patient chronic intractable pain receive codeine , morphine hydrochloride , fentanyl injectable formulation . After pre-treatment period seven fourteen day evaluate eligibility patient study , patient treat 4 week Treatment period 1 48 week Treatment period 2 follow 3-day post-treatment observation period . One patch use 72 hour , exist Patch . Starting first day treatment , fentanyl apply chest , upper arm appropriate site , replace new patch every three day ( ca . 72 hr ) . Starting dose 12.5 mcg/hr 75 mcg/hr , depend prior opioid dose .</detailed_description>
