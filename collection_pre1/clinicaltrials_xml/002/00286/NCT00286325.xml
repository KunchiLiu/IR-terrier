	<brief_title>Rituximab Treatment Patients With Bullous Pemphigoid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bullous pemphigoid ( BP ) autoimmune blister disease characterize clinically presence severely itchy , tense blister locate trunk extremity . BP common autoimmune blistering disease incidence approximately 10 per 1,000,000 population ( 1 ; 2 ) . In addition , BP occur frequently elderly . Routine histopathology reveals sub-epidermal blister often large number eosinophil . Direct immunofluorescence skin patient BP reveals linear band C3 IgG basement membrane zone . Examination serum patient show presence circulate anti-basement membrane zone autoantibody . This antibody find direct 180 kd protein basement membrane zone type XVII collagen ( BPAg2 ) 230 kd protein ( BPAg1 ) find epidermal hemi-desmosome ( 3 ; 4 ) . BP severe disease often require therapy high dose systemic corticosteroid ( 0.75 - 1.0 mg/kg/day ) often month ( 5 ) . In addition , relapse common additional use immunosuppressive drug azathioprine , methotrexate , cyclosporine A others need minimize dose systemic corticosteroid . The 1-year mortality BP estimate range 10 - 30 % ( 1 ; 6 ) . Currently treatment patient BP consist initial use systemic corticosteroid ( 0.75 - 1.0 mg/kg/day ) . Control symptoms new blister formation often achieve within 1 month systemic corticosteroid taper . As many 33 - 50 % patient may able taper clinically acceptable level systemic corticosteroid , require addition systemic immunosuppression often azathioprine . Approximately 66 % patient require long term treatment immunosuppressive medication maintain control blistering . ( 5 ; 7 ; 8 ) The need long term systemic corticosteroid therapy often systemic immunosuppression elderly population result significant morbidity mortality patient BP . New therapeutic intervention would potentially allow rapid discontinuation prednisone , avoidance systemic immuno- suppression perhaps earlier clinical relapse would substantial benefit patient BP . The clinical laboratory data demonstrate BP autoantibody mediate blistering disease . Taken together observation suggest use anti-CD20 antibody ( Rituxan ) may useful treatment patient BP . We previously treat patient BP graft versus host disease anti-CD20 anti-CD25 able achieve clinical serological remission within 4 week initiation therapy ( 9 ) . In addition , others successfully utilized Rituxan treatment pemphigus vulgaris , another autoantibody mediate , autoimmune blister disease ( 10-15 )</detailed_description>
