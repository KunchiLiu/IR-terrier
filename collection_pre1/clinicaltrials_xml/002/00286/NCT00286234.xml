	<brief_summary>This research study conduct test effect two drug blood lipid ( cholesterol triglyceride ) blood sugar ( glucose ) level patient diabetes `` pre-diabetes '' ( condition call `` insulin-resistance '' ) . These product Niaspan ( extended release nicotinic acid ) Omacor ( omega-3 acid ethyl ester ) . We hypothesize combination Niaspan Omacor reduce serum triglyceride level , increase HDL-cholesterol level without alter glucose level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The insulin resistance syndrome ( IRS ) afflict approximately 25 % US adult population . Its principal component include follow : central obesity , elevate triglyceride level , decrease high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) level , preponderance small , dense low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) particle , hyperglycemia , hypertension , increase thrombotic tendency . Subjects IRS increase risk type 2 diabetes and/or coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . While lifestyle change ( diet exercise ) often improve many manifestation IRS , pharmacotherapy often need normalize individual component . In recent study laboratory , niacin fish oil ( n-3 fatty acid , FA ) use combination insulin resistant individual lead expect improved lipid phenotype ( reduced triglyceride , increase HDL-C , few , small , dense LDL particle ) . What expect , however , important marker adipose tissue insulin resistance - meal-induced suppression free fatty acid ( FFA ) flux - would improve well . Further , know agent ( give monotherapy ) report worsen glycemia diabetic subject , surprise find significant deterioration glycemic control . Further preliminary study patient poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes confirm ability combination over-the-counter natural agent significantly improve lipid profile without adverse effect glycemia . Our work hypothesis excessive FFA flux adipose tissue raise serum triglyceride concentration lead manifestation IRS . FFA flux chronically elevate insulin resistant subject due insensitivity ( i.e. , resistance ) adipocytes anti-lipolytic effect insulin . Released FFA ( especially visceral adipose depot ) stimulate hepatic triglyceride synthesis , lead elevate serum triglyceride level subsequently contribute reduced HDL-C increase small , dense LDL concentration . In addition , high FFA flux interfere whole body glucose disposal . If hypothesis true , intervention improve adipocyte insulin sensitivity may expect improve spectrum risk factor associate insulin resistant state . Since preliminary study support hypothesis , propose follow four specific aim test 4-arm , randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind trial : Specific Aim 1 . To test hypothesis n-3 FA niacin ( give singly combination ) enhance insulin-mediated suppression FFA rate appearance ( Ra ; surrogate adipose tissue insulin sensitivity ) insulin resistant subject . Specific Aim 2 . To test hypothesis n-3 FA niacin ( give singly combination ) improve insulin sensitivity insulin resistant subject . Specific Aim 3 . To test hypothesis n-3 FA niacin ( give singly combination ) reduce VLDL-triglyceride production rate insulin resistant subject . Specific Aim 4 . To test hypothesis n-3 FA niacin ( give singly combination ) improve dyslipidemic profile ( i.e. , reduce serum triglyceride small , dense LDL concentration elevate HDL-C concentration ) insulin resistant subject . At completion study , expect detail information potential therapeutic efficacy kinetic mechanism action combine treatment n-3 FA niacin . A good understanding action agent lead clear appreciation relationship FFA flux insulin resistance , effective therapy dyslipidemia insulin resistance ultimately reduce risk CAD burgeon patient population .</detailed_description>
