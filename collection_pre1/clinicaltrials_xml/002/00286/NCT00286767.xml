	<brief_summary>This study investigate factor may lead development immune reconstitution syndrome ( IRIS ) HIV-infected patient outcome IRIS . It also seek good define describe syndrome . IRIS condition occur HIV-infected people follow start antiretroviral therapy . The sudden improvement immune function therapy cause unexpected worsen disease patient already , tuberculosis fungal infection , development fever , enlarge lymph node complication , even uncover previously silent disease . HIV-infected people least 18 year old , whose CD4+T cell count 100 cell per microliter le , previously treat combination antiretroviral therapy take drug less 3 month 6 month screen study may eligible participate . Candindates must also live within wider DC area acute problem therapy initiation evaluate NIH . Candidates evaluate start therapy medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram , chest x-ray CT scan chest , tuberculin skin testing , apheresis , possibly intestinal ( gut ) lymph node biopsy ( surgical removal small piece tissue microscopic examination ) . For apheresis , blood collect needle arm vein spin machine separate blood component . The white blood cell plasma remove , red cell platelet return needle needle vein arm . Participants complete history physical examination additional blood test , include genetic study , upon enter study . They start take anti-HIV medication , prescribe accord current standard care , well medication treat infection , treatment IRIS , need . The study last 4 year . Patients return clinic 2 , 4 , 8 12 week entry visit , every 12 week ( every 3 month ) week 48 ( first year ) , every 16 week ( every 4 month ) end study . At visit , patient medical history , physical examination blood urine test , include CD4+T cell count HIV plasma viral load measurement . Apheresis also do week 24 48 every 48 week . Intestinal lymph node biopsy ( optional ) also do week 24 48 . A syphilis test PAP smear ( woman ) do yearly . plasma , cell serum store almost every visit immunologic study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A cohort observational study evaluate predictor , incidence , clinical presentation immunopathogenesis Immune Reconstitution Syndrome ( IRIS ) human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV-1 ) infect patient CD4 Count less equal 100 cells/microL initiate antiretroviral therapy . Immune reconstitution syndrome ( IRIS ) clinical syndrome describe HIV infect patient initiation highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( HAART ) , characterize paradoxical acute worsen underlying opportunistic infection AIDS-defining illness . There widely accept syndromic definition , pathogenesis syndrome unclear specific therapy . The syndrome common patient low CD4+ T cell count ( less 50 cells/microL ) certain underlying infection ( e.g . mycobacterial cryptococcal infection ) typically observe evidence response HAART patient still risk opportunistic infection ( OIs ) AIDS define illness ( e.g . pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia cytomegalovirus [ CMV ] retinitis ) . The incidence IRIS varies depend studied population frequent develop country create significant diagnostic therapeutic challenge well utilization limited health resource . DESIGN : International observational cohort study . Participants evaluate baseline follow accord protocol follow schedule initiation antiretroviral therapy total two year . Acute symptom may represent manifestation IRIS also evaluate additional acute care visit necessary . DURATION : Enrollment ongoing . Each volunteer follow least two year . Total duration study approximately 8 year ( include optional extension phase US ) . SAMPLE SIZE : Approximately 600 patient enrol , 200 Kenya , 100 Thailand 300 US . ( enrollment US continue approximately sit full ) . Based incidence IRIS patient low CD4 count ( approximately 20-40 percent ) , anticipate strong power ( approximately 90 percent ) identify baseline factor predictive IRIS . POPULATION : HIV-l-infected men woman , age great equal 18 year , antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) -naive CD4+ T cell count less equal 100 cells/mm ( 3 ) . Participants recruit follow three site : broad Washington DC , Kericho , Kenya Bangkok , Thailand area . REGIMEN : Participants initiate ART accord clinical standard care . If OI AIDS define illness identify prior screen point study , also treat accord standard care .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . For National Institutes Health ( NIH ) /US site : HIV1 infection , document OraQuick rapid test use venipuncture whole blood , fingerstick whole blood do screening ; reactive enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) Western Blot determine NIH Clinical Pathology Laboratory Leidos Biomedical Research , Inc . Monitoring Laboratory . HIV infection determine outside Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) approve laboratory facility '' accept enrollment verify standard HIV1 ELISA Western Blot NIH . For Keny Medical Research Institute/Walter Reed Project Clinical Research Center ( KEMRI/WRP CRC ) /Kenya site : HIV1 infection initially diagnose base upon two , serial rapid HIV test accord Kenya Ministry Health ( MOH ) guideline . Volunteers enter study HIV infection confirm two serial rapid HIV test accordance Kenya MOH guideline test algorithm follow confirmation Western Blot use FDA approvedkits . Samples participant discrepant result ( result institution KEMRI/WRPCRC laboratory ) and/or indeterminate/negative Western Blot subject nucleic acid assay i.e . DNA RNA PCR . For Thailand , HIV1 screen confirmatory test base 3 , HIV test accord Thai Ministry Public Health guideline . The subject initially test chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay ( CMIA ) method detects HIV antigen antibody . Confirmatory test HIV reactive sample two different antibody detection method follow . Positive result three method confirm HIV diagnosis . Discrepancy test require nucleic acid detection method confirm HIV diagnosis . 2 . No previous treatment potent combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , define protease inhibitor ( PI ) base nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) base regimen , even triple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) base regimen , consist least three antiretroviral drug ( include boost PI NNRTI combination ) . Patients limited use ART ( less 12 week duration ) 24 week screen eligible study participation . 3 . Screening CD4+ cell count less equal 100 cells/mm ( 3 ) . * Note : CD4 &lt; 100 cells/microL outside site laboratory within 8 week prior screen accept screen value . 4 . Residence within wide Washington D.C. area ( approximately within 120mile radius NIH Bethesda campus ) National Institutes Health/US site resident Kericho District Hospital catchment area , approximate 93mile ( 150 kilometer ) radius , KEMRI/WRP CRC/Kenya site . Residence within Bangkok Metropolitan area nearby province allow participate ( approximately 120mile radius clinical site ) 5 . Men woman age great equal 18 year . 6 . Ability willingness subject legal guardian/representative understand study requirement give informed consent . 7 . Be willing allow storage blood tissue sample future research .
