	<brief_summary>The specific aim study – 1 . To determine effect GH height , height velocity , body weight lean body mass . This specific aim test hypothesis GH significantly improve height , height velocity , weight , weight velocity lean body mass chronically ill child grow poorly despite adequate nutritional rehabilitation . 2 . To determine effect GH whole body protein turnover ( WBPT ) , IGF-1 level cytokine . This specific aim test hypothesis chronically ill child increase catabolism , cause high level circulate cytokine low level IGF-1 , abnormality improve GH treatment . 3 . Evaluation bone mineral density bone turnover . This specific aim test hypothesis bone density low chronically ill child secondary increase osteoclast activity correlate elevate cytokine level . We hypothesize anabolic effect growth hormone ( GH ) improve height weight chronically ill child fail grow despite receive adequate nutrition via gastrostomy tube oral supplementation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We test hypothesis use pilot study , recruit 18 chronically ill child clinical practice . We obtain medical record patient 12 month prior start study . Those patient without pre-study medical record study 12 month prior start GH . If obtain 6 month prior medical record , patient study 6 month start GH . Anything less 6 month study full 12 month prior start GH . Patients receive treatment GH ( 0.3 mg/kg/wk ) 12 month growth compare year treatment . All subject follow every three month entire study . We measure height weight use standardized stadiometer scale , respectively , every three month study . From measurement calculate height weight velocity height weight Z score . Lean body mass ( LBM ) measure DEXA every six month . Utilizing stable isotope 1- [ 13C ] leucine , measure whole body protein turnover ( WBPT ) . Measurements WBPT correlate LBM change height weight velocity . This data compare age match normal child ( archival data maintain PI ) . We measure IGF-1 cytokine TNF-α , IL-6 IL 10 baseline six month . We evaluate GH effect level .</detailed_description>
