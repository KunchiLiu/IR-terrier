	<brief_summary>Recently increase awareness need adequate sedation pain control Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) patient . Fentanyl opioid commonly use Pediatric ICU patient decrease pain increase sedation . Although opioids ( e.g . morphine fentanyl ) provide excellent pain relief , many side effect include dependence , tolerance withdrawal . These side effect lead increase dos order maintain pain control and/or sedation . There adult study point possible treatment . For example , give low dose naloxone along opioids . Adult study show combination decrease frequency opioid side effect , also improve pain control prevent development tolerance . We propose child receive low dose naloxone infusion along fentanyl infusion demonstrate : 1 ) decrease total daily dos Fentanyl , 2 ) decrease frequency withdrawal 3 ) increase pain sedation control . In randomized , blind prospective trial enroll 168 Pediatric ICU patient . Patients receive either low dose naloxone placebo simultaneously fentanyl infusion . Pain sedation assess use Modified Motor Activity Assessment Scale ( MMAAS ) . The fentanyl infusion increase provide adequate pain control and/or sedation . Naloxone infusion adjust . Approximately 48 hour prior removal ventilator , patient fentanyl infusion decrease monitor withdrawal . Patients show sign withdrawal receive methadone , opioid take mouth . Once fentanyl , naloxone stop . Patients continue monitor withdrawal 4 day ICU discharge . If study work , patient receive low dose naloxone along opioid infusion less tolerance dependence demonstrate less withdrawal . This may cause short Intensive Care Unit stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Low Dose Naloxone Fentanyl Requirements Pediatric ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine Naloxone administration pediatric ICU patient Fentanyl infusion require less Fentanyl compare control patient . Background : During recent year increase awareness need adequate sedation analgesia critically ill pediatric patient . The choice treatment pain numerous , Pediatric ICU parenteral opioids commonly use . At equipotent dos , mu agonist opioids ( Morphine , Fentanyl , Meperidine Codeine ) produce similar physiologic effect side effect . Opioids cause hypoventilation , hypotension , constipation cause urinary retention . Patients receive continuous opioid infusion experience physiologic side effect , also side effect dependence , tolerance withdrawal . These last side effect complicate medical issue contribute long ICU admission . Anand write review article address problem drug dependence withdrawal PICU . In article discuss mechanism , pharmacology presentation opioid withdrawal . He also discuss prevention opioid withdrawal include therapy concomitant infusion opioid agonist low dose Naloxone . Tobias also write review article describe consequence prolong use sedative analgesic agent Pediatric ICU . Among problem note tolerance , dependence withdrawal Pediatric ICU . He discuss several possible therapy treatment prevention opioid withdrawal . Among concomitant infusion opioid agonist low dose Naloxone , opioid agonist . Naloxone selectively block opioid receptor couple stimulatory G protein , thus block mechanisms super-activation cAMP pathway . This improve efficacy analgesia prevents development acute tolerance . Recent preclinical clinical study ( Crain , Gan , Levine , Joshi ) show co-treatments extremely low dos opioid receptor antagonist markedly enhance efficacy specific Morphine related analgesic . Crain study use Naloxone , in-vitro in-vivo , show direct competitive antagonism Gs couple excitatory opioid receptor function . This markedly enhance Morphine ’ antinociceptive potency simultaneously attenuate opioid tolerance dependence . Studies Gan Levine adult post-op hysterectomy patient one study adult patient follow tooth extraction separate study show low dose Naloxone could enhance analgesic potency opioid agonist . The striking consistency study provide evidence clinical treatment pain improve administer opioid analgesic together low dos excitatory opioid receptor antagonist . The possibility effect occur Pediatric ICU patient explore . Hypothesis : Children admit Pediatric ICU require continuous infusion opioids receive low dose Naloxone infusions 30 % decrease maximum total daily dose Fentanyl decrease need escalate dos continuous infusion ICU admission . Study Design : This prospective double-blinded randomize placebo-controlled study . Patients admit ICU consent study start either Naloxone continuous infusion 0.25micrograms/kilogram/hour ( mcg/kg/hr ) normal saline continuous infusion equal rate volume determine pharmacy . The dose rate Naloxone infusion manipulate throughout study . During first four hour ICU admission patient assess hourly via Modified Motor Activity Assessment Scale ( MMAAS , see appendix 1 ) . Adjustments make Fentanyl Midazolam infusion accord protocol patient achieve sedation score –1 +1 ( see figure 1 ) . Patients score great +1 associate tachycardia/hypertension receive bolus Fentanyl repeat MMAAS 30 minute . The Fentanyl bolus equal one hour total dose Fentanyl infusion consideration weight . Dosage adjust weight accordingly : 1mcg/kg child less 50kg 0.5mcg/kg child great 50kg . If repeat MMAAS score great +1 hypertension/tachycardia patient receive another bolus Fentanyl ( dose denote ) increase Fentanyl infusion 1mcg/kg/hr . The patient repeat MMAAS 30 minute change . If repeat MMAAS score still great +1 physician call assessment intervention . If first repeat MMAAS score great +1 hypertension/tachycardia patient receive bolus Midazolam . The Midazolam bolus either equal one hour total dose Midazolam infusion 0.1mg/kg consideration weight . Dosage adjust accord weight : 0.1mg/kg child less 20kg 0.05mg/kg child great 20kg . The patient repeat MMAAS 30 minute . If second MMAAS score still great +1 physician call assessment intervention . If MMAAS score time +1 –1 repeat MMAAS repeat next scheduled time per protocol ( see figure 2 ) . If patient require increase 2 mcg/kg/hr within 3 hour , patient Midazolam either start increase . Dosage 0.1 mg/kg/hr child le 20kg 0.05 mg/kg/hr child 20kg start Midazolam . Dosage increase current infusion 0.1mg/kg/hr child less 20kg 0.05mg/kg/hr child 20kg . Patients assess hourly , use MMAAS , first four hour admission study every 2 hour subsequent 8 hour . After initial time period patient assess every 4 hour completion study . Each assessment consist record sedation score , temperature , heart rate , respiratory rate , ventilator set rate , blood pressure , oxygen saturation , infusion rate Fentanyl and/or Midazolam need intervention intervention include . Patients sign increase pain/discomfort assess use sedation scale need scheduled assessment . Interventions make per protocol need schedule assessment . Once pt MMAAS score +1 –1 patient resume schedule MMAAS evaluation accord protocol . If patient sedation score &lt; -1 MMAAS , among scheduled intermittent assessment , Midazolam infusion decrease 0.05 mg/kg/hr patient reassess two hour . If Midazolam infusion , Fentanyl infusion decrease 0.5mcg/kg/hr patient reassess two hour . If patient continue pain score &lt; -1 repeat MMAAS Fentanyl Midazolam continuous infusion decrease denote . The patient reassess two hour . If patient continue MMAAS score &lt; -1 physician notify assessment intervention . If repeat MMAAS score &gt; +1 Fentanyl infusion increase noted patient reassess 30 min . If second repeat MMAAS +1 –1 physician notify assessment intervention . If time MMAAS score +1 –1 MMAAS repeat per protocol . If follow first decrease infusion repeat MMAAS score &gt; +1 infusion previous adjust increased prior dose . The patient reassess 30 minute . If repeat MMAAS score &gt; +1 hypertension/tachycardia Fentanyl infusion increase note . If MMAAS score &gt; +1 hypertension/tachycardia Midazolam infusion increase note . After intervention MMAAS repeat 30 minute . If repeat MMAAS score remain &gt; +1 physician notify assessment intervention ( see figure 3 ) . As patient approach 48-72 hour near end need continuous infusion opioid , per decision medical staff , wean infusion . The Naloxone infusion remain unchanged . The Naloxone infusion normal saline infusion discontinue Fentanyl infusion discontinue . The Fentanyl infusion decrease 25 % original dose every 12 hour . Once patient start Fentanyl wean withdrawal assess every six hour need use Modified Narcotic Withdrawal Scale ( MNAS , see appendix 2 ) . Patients receive two successive score 8 determine withdrawal . These patient start Methadone direct primary team Fentanyl infusion continue decrease 25 % every 12 hour . As patient wean continuous infusion continue assessment every 6 hour use MNAS infusion discontinue . Once continuous infusion Fentanyl discontinue patient information continue monitor use MNAS vital sign state earlier 4 day ICU discharge . Any need reinstitution continuous infusion Fentanyl medical reason action note . Increases oral agent receive first four dos note . The need intermittent boluses IV analgesia sedation wean associate medical reason note . These thing monitor duration study . Patients may receive bolus medication order physician procedure without interfere study . Notation action make next assessment . If time physician deems necessary begin medication classify opioid benzodiazepine patient remove study . If time physician begin schedule dose additional opioid benzodiazepine total one class patient remove study . Adverse event ( nausea , vomiting , sweat , tachycardia , increase blood pressure , tremulousness , seizures cardiac arrest ) note medical record . If medical reason event rule patient unblinded study . Statistical Analysis An SPSS software random number generator use create permute block randomization schedule . Patient assignment unknown investigator medical team member , exception PICU pharmacist . Power analysis base upon assumed power 80 % , effect size 30 % reduction maximum cumulative daily dose fentanyl , historical data maximum daily fentanyl dose PICU Children ’ Medical Center Dallas ( Between January August 2002 , cumulative maximum daily fentanyl dose 428 PICU patient 79 mcg/kg standard deviation ± 47 mcg/kg ) .
