	<brief_title>Efficacy Lapaquistat Acetate Alone Combined With Simvastatin Subjects With Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated plasma cholesterol ( hypercholesterolemia ) various plasma lipid imbalance ( dyslipidemias ) major risk factor coronary heart disease . Patients hypercholesterolemia elevate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , lead atherosclerotic deposition cholesterol arterial wall . As identified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III , lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentration effectively reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality essential prevention management coronary heart disease . Currently , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) first-line monotherapies prescribe reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , diet therapeutic lifestyle change . However , low dos statin often fail produce ATP III-recommended level low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction , make necessary increase dose add additional treatment . Dose increase statin turn may result decreased tolerability potential safety concern contribute high discontinuation rate statins prescription low , often ineffective , dos . The purpose study determine whether administration lapaquistat acetate co-administered simvastatin efficacious lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , compare lapaquistat simvastatin alone . Total participation time study anticipate 19 week .</detailed_description>
