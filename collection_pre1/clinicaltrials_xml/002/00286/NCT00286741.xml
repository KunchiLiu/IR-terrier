	<detailed_description>Background : Diabetes common , morbid expensive disease among veteran . Achieving adequate glycemic control blood pressure control reduce devastate complication diabetes . Because majority patient achieve adequate control blood sugar blood pressure , innovative strategy improve control need . One strategy great potential veteran receive VA care group clinic . Group clinic develop last 5-10 year , show improve clinical outcome reduce outpatient utilization geriatric setting . Group medical clinic involve cohort 8-20 patient 1-2 hour group visit . These clinic distinguish traditional group education visit diabetes fact visit involve one physician one additional health care professional , usually nurse practitioner and/or pharmacist , design make management change number people disease short period time . The effect group medical clinic blood sugar , blood pressure , cost diabetes care , unknown . Objectives : Our primary objective project determine effectiveness cost-effectiveness group visit intervention improve rate control diabetes high blood pressure patient illness . Methods : We perform two-site , randomize , control trial group medical visit diabetes management . Patients patient primary care Durham Richmond VAMC 's inadequate control blood sugar blood pressure . We exclude patient life-limiting illness . Patients randomize control arm receive usual primary care . Patients randomize intervention arm assign attend group medical clinic every two month one year . In clinic , primary care physician , assistance nurse pharmacist , measure blood pressure point care , review blood sugar log , make necessary medical change patient diabetes . The primary outcome hemoglobin A1c systolic blood pressure . Additional outcome serum LDL-cholesterol , diabetes-specific quality life , health service utilization . Formative evaluation undertaken determine mechanism intervention prepare successful dissemination intervention effective . Formal cost analysis perform cost-effectiveness analysis undertaken . All outcome measure baseline , 6 12 month begin intervention . Status : All patient contact complete . Project analysis phase .</detailed_description>
