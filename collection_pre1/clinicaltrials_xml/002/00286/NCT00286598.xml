	<brief_summary>The role weight-bearing physical activity development diabetic foot ulcer remain poorly understood . Regular participation moderately intense physical activity ( e.g . brisk walk ) reduce 8-year cardiovascular mortality diabetes mellitus 30 % . The American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) recommend least 30 minute daily moderate intensity activity people diabetes . However , ADA recommend people diabetes insensate foot , affect 40 % diabetes , limit walk concern walk could increase risk foot ulcer amputation . Firm evidence lack support concern ; fact , research fellow I conduct observational study show daily weight-bearing activity may reduce risk foot ulceration among people diabetic foot problem . A controlled clinical trial need study issue . The present study randomize control trial 100 old adult diabetes insensate foot , 50 participate individually-tailored behavior-change intervention call `` Feet First '' , 50 control . The intervention base extensively-tested CHAMPS model use Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 's Active Life Program . Feet First extend target population beyond old adult generally people insensate foot due diabetic peripheral neuropathy . The specific aim study : - To determine whether Feet First intervention subject achieve great increase weight-bearing activity control subject , - To obtain preliminary evidence intervention subject ' foot outcome ( foot function , foot-related self-care , risk foot ulcer ) , compare control subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feet First : Promoting Physical Activity Among People With Diabetes Mellitus Insensate Feet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity vital component self-management patient diabetes mellitus , yet special problem patient whose disease complicate insensate foot ( i.e . loss protective sensation cause diabetic distal symmetric sensory peripheral neuropathy ) . Foot ulcer develop 15 % 17 million people United States diabetes mellitus , contribute 84 % foot toe amputation . Foot ulcer risk high among insensate foot . Although role neuropathy , plantar foot pressure , footwear foot ulcer extensively study , independent role physical activity . The overall goal study determine whether `` lifestyle '' physical activity intervention , base Second Community Healthy Activities Model Program Seniors ( CHAMPS II ) , call FEET FIRST , use safely increase moderate-intensity physical activity ( achieve least 40 % maximal oxygen consumption , walk briskly ) among people diabetes insensate foot . `` Lifestyle '' physical activity intervention help participant accumulate least 30 minute self-selected activity short bout day . CHAMPS II effectively safely increased physical activity sedentary old adult multiple chronic illness . Substantial research also find people diabetic peripheral neuropathy also increase risk fall . Diabetic peripheral neuropathy also lead postural instability , i.e . impairment measure functional dynamic balance . Moreover , instability worsens age . People diabetic peripheral neuropathy particular tend ankle instability due decrease proprioception , make less able rapidly recover balance sudden ankle dorsiflexion , inversion eversion walk uneven surface . There ample evidence promotion active lifestyle specific exercise target endurance , strength balance improve reduces functional decline elderly , home-based exercise program effectively decrease fall risk elderly well . One small , non-randomized trial find preliminary evidence 3-week intervention focus ankle strength improve balance measure diabetic peripheral neuropathy . However , randomized study investigate effect physical activity intervention fall risk community-dwelling people diabetic peripheral neuropathy , may also increase risk cutaneous injury ( i.e . foot lesion ) weight-bearing activity . Before unequivocally recommend people diabetic peripheral neuropathy engage exercise , need determine safe foot , increase fall risk .</detailed_description>
