	<brief_summary>Severely ill patient admit intensive care unit may develop acute failure kidney function . To bridge period recovery , renal function temporarily replace continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) . To prevent clot hemofiltration circuit , heparin generally use , provide anticoagulation circuit patient . As result , bleed complication may occur , necessitate transfusion blood . Anticoagulation circuit also obtain use tri-sodium citrate , provide anticoagulation circuit without affect coagulation patient thus without increase his/her risk bleeding . The use citrate may however cause metabolic complication . Primary aim present study show large group intensive care patient whether use regional anticoagulation citrate safe compare systemic anticoagulation low molecular weight heparin nadroparin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severely ill patient admit intensive care unit may develop acute failure kidney function . Renal function generally recover acute illness improves . To bridge period , renal function temporarily replace continuous hemofiltration , call continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) . To remove toxic substance fluid , patient 's blood flow circuit , contain filter . Flow filter regulate CVVH-device . Normally blood start clot soon leave body . To prevent clot blood filter , blood 'anticoagulated ' . For purpose , heparins generally use . Heparins make blood less likely clot . Drawback use heparins prevent clot blood circuit filter , also patient . Heparins thereby increase risk bleed . Intensive care patient high risk bleeding due recent operation trauma , ulcer mouth stomach , abnormality blood acute illness . Due continuous application CVVH day , anticoagulation administer without interruption prolong period time . Studies report bleed complication 5 50 % patient . As result bleeding , patient need blood transfusion sometimes surgery . Control bleed sometimes extremely difficult . An alternative heparin citrate , allow regional anticoagulation circuit filter without effect increase risk bleeding patient . Anticoagulation citrate complex , nurse need follow strict protocol.. Several small study show regional anticoagulation citrate associate less bleeding longer filter survival . The use citrate however associate great risk metabolic complication , protocol strictly follow . Primary aim present study show large group intensive care patient whether use regional anticoagulation citrate safe compare systemic anticoagulation low molecular weight heparin nadroparin .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Intensive care patient schedule continuous venovenous hemofiltration Severe preexistent liver failure ( cirrhosis Child C ) , acute liver dysfunction occur septic shock reason exclusion Active bleeding bleed necessitate infusion two red blood cell unit within 24 hour start hemofiltration fall hemoglobin &gt; 0.5 mmol/l . A fall hemoglobin/hematocrit result fluid loading regard bleeding . Surgery within 24 h prior CVVH . Patients need full systemic anticoagulation ( unfractionated heparin dose &gt; 10000 IU/day , nadroparin &gt; 3800 IU/day ) reason Expectation die within 24 hour Chronic dialysis Proven suspect heparininduced thrombocytopenia</criteria>
