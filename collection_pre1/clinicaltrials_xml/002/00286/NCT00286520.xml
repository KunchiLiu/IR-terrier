	<detailed_description>The magnitude bowel dysfunction spinal cord injury patient document several study . Spinal cord injury affect colorectal motility , transit time , bowel empty often leading constipation , fecal incontinence combination . Although symptoms life-threatening , may severe impact quality life well increase level anxiety depression . Various bowel management program empirical , individual solution seek trial-and-error basis . Transanal irrigation use select patient constipation fecal incontinence . The majority spinal cord injure patient recent study benefit treatment . However , limited evidence literature support bowel management program spinal cord injury favor another well-designed control trial still lack . Therefore , present study aim compare transanal irrigation conservative bowel management , define best supportive bowel care without irrigation , prospective , randomize , control , multicentre study among spinal cord injure patient neurogenic bowel dysfunction .</detailed_description>
