	<brief_summary>Atomoxetine ( Strattera ) drug currently approve treatment attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) child adult . Atomoxetine work enhance level brain chemical may affect people executive dysfunction , ( difficulty organization , task completion , priority setting ) . Thus , atomoxetine potential improve executive dysfunction people Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The goal study provide preliminary data effectiveness tolerability atomoxetine treatment executive dysfunction patient PD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinson ’ disease ( PD ) , define motor abnormality associate dopaminergic loss , invariably accompany cognitive impairment . Early disease course , deficit characterize executive dysfunction difficulty task involve information processing , attention , sort , planning , set-shifting , work memory subserve neural connection prefrontal brain region . There little effort identify treatment PD-related cognitive impairment , despite disable distress effect . Accordingly , goal proposal conduct small pilot study determine effectiveness tolerability atomoxetine , selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor , treatment executive dysfunction patient PD . Atomoxetine ( Strattera ) currently approve FDA treatment attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) child adult . Atomoxetine enhance dopaminergic noradrenergic transmission frontal region also implicate executive dysfunction thus potential improve executive dysfunction PD well neurological condition . Results study use develop large placebo-controlled trial atomoxetine , appropriate , well inform design clinical trial potential treatment cognitive dysfunction PD . The overall hypothesis atomoxetine effective safe treatment executive dysfunction PD .</detailed_description>
