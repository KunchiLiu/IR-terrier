	<brief_summary>This study prospective , randomize , open-label , pilot clinical trial design compare effect agent antiproliferative ( 1,2 ) , antiangiogenesis ( 3 ) , tumor-progression blocking capability ( 4 ) , namely , rapamycin ( Rapamune® ) , treatment autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) . Up time , generic renal disease treatment ADPKD use , treatment hypertension , urinary tract infection , renal stone , renal call carcinoma , replacement therapy dialysis and/or renal transplantation . The fundamental aberration ADPKD proliferation cyst-forming tubuloepithelial cell , secretion cytokine-rich fluid cyst , progressive cyst expansion release inflammatory mediator injure surround normal renal tissue . Consequently , therapy direct specifically block proliferation tubuloepithelial cell tendency malignant transformation , well impede blood supply , obvious merit . General Procedures : In Group I participants iothalamate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) equal great 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 , Group II participants GFR less 25-59 ml/min/1.73 m2 . Both male female ADPKD volunteer qualify , randomly prospectively assign treatment rapamycin either high low trough blood level standard care ( 1/3 enrol patient ) one year . The two treatment group receive rapamycin dos aim maintain 20- 24-hour trough blood level either 2 5 ng/mL ( low-dose ) , great 5 8 ng/mL ( high-dose ) . These trough level low range level use treat renal transplant recipient trough level typically maintain 5 15 ng/mL .</brief_summary>
