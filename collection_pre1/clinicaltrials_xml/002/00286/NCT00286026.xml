	<brief_summary>Trachoma world 's leading cause preventable blindness . This disease , cause Chlamydia trachomatis , endemic many part develop world . In 1990s evaluated use community-wide treatment oral azithromycin project call Azithromycin Control Trachoma ( ACT ) . This approach result clinical improvement dramatic reduction prevalence chlamydial infection 1-year follow-up . We enrol ACT village , well additional village prior treatment , ACT II ( 2005 ) study perform clinical survey assess trachoma activity test conjunctival swabs presence C. trachomatis nucleic acid amplification test ( NAATs ) . Thus , hop determine long-term ( 10 year ) effect azithromycin treatment . We complete census clinical survey initial three village . Mass treatment azithromycin would justify low rate ( 1.8 - 4 % ) ocular chlamydial infection . We treat live household one case chlamydial infection follow individually treated family . In order achieve goal study , propose identify remote village trachoma infection rate 20 % evaluate effect community-wide treatment single dose oral azithromycin . If one village ( dependent upon population ) trachoma rate 20 % invited participate azithromycin treatment . In one set subject ( 1 2 village , dependent upon population infection rate ) perform treatment , follow 2- , 12- , 24-months post-treatment ascertain infection rate . In second set subject ( 1 2 village , dependent upon population infection rate ) perform treatment , perform re-treatment 30-days post initial treatment , follow 2- , 12- , 24-months post-treatment ascertain infection rate . This help u determine need for/and best time re-treatment eliminate blinding trachoma , recent study suggest 2-4 % failure rate initial treatment . In sum , study provide rational approach use community-wide azithromycin treatment eliminate blind trachoma public health problem</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This operational research aim well define use oral azithromycin part SAFE strategy eliminate blinding trachoma . 1 . Before examination , census sketch map house village . Particular emphasis place identify child 1 6 year age . These child chief reservoir infection , would young ( unborn ) ACT study treatment , particular interest determine disease infection status . 2 . Egyptian ophthalmologist examine eyelid , conjunctiva cornea use magnify loupe hand hold light , grade follow ACT protocol contain category referable W.H.O . detailed grading scheme . The clinical finding record standardized form . 3 . Egyptian health aide photograph inside right upper eyelid subject . The photographs subject initial visit subsequent examination examine confirm consistency clinical finding period study . 4 . To test chlamydial infection , single fiber-tipped swab stroke gently conjunctiva right eye Egyptian ophthalmologist . These swab place special tube test Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid amplification assay . [ APTIMA® Gen-Probe Inc. ( San Diego , CA . ) ] The APTIMA® assay detects DNA via r-RNA process call transcription mediate amplification . Laboratory test perform Chlamydia Research Laboratory University California , San Francisco . 5 . After result obtain nucleic acid amplification test perform laboratory San Francisco , treatment trachoma do single-dose oral azithromycin ( 20 mg/kg body weight child , 1.0 gm adult ) . The azithromycin donate Pfizer International . Young child weigh determine dose azithromycin dos administer health aide direct supervision Egyptian physician ( Dr. Mahfouz ) . One set subject ( 1 2 village depend upon population size , order generate meaningful number ) receive initial treatment 1.0 gm azithromycin ; second set subject receive initial treatment 1.0 gm azithromycin , follow second dose 1.0 gm azithromycin 30 day post treatment . 1 . If prevalence clinical trachoma 20 % child 10 , everyone village treat oral azithromycin . After initial azithromycin treatment , follow-up examination specimen collection do 2 , 12 , 24 month post-treatment trachoma chlamydial infection . 2 . If prevalence 10 % 20 % , child 10 , family child active trachoma , treat . After initial azithromycin treatment , follow-up examination specimen collection do 2 , 12 , 24 month post-treatment trachoma chlamydial infection . 3 . If prevalence le 10 % , child active disease family receive treatment . There follow-up examination . Adults old child tell azithromycin cause nausea , vomiting , loose stool vomit child adult , occur 5 % ( 1 person 20 ) treat . It note previous ACT study , 8,000 people receive azithromycin complaint beyond minor gastro-intestinal upset . 6 . All positive specimen major outer membrane gene amplify sequence . The genovars map location within village family distribution follow time , treatment provide well understanding epidemiology infection . Results study use data input generation mathematical model predict whether community-wide retreatment ( alternate strategy ) need , optimal timing retreatment .</detailed_description>
