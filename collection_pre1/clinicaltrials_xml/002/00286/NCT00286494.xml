	<brief_title>Study Alogliptin Combined With Pioglitazone Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 19 million people United States diagnose diabetes mellitus , 90 % 95 % type 2 . The prevalence type 2 diabetes varies among racial ethnic population show correlate age , obesity , family history , history gestational diabetes , physical inactivity . Over next decade , mark increase number adult diabetes mellitus expect . Takeda develop SYR-322 ( alogliptin ) improvement glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . Alogliptin inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme . Dipeptidyl peptidase IV think primarily responsible degradation 2 peptide hormone release response nutrient ingestion . It expect inhibition dipeptidyl peptidase IV improve glycemic ( glucose ) control patient type 2 diabetes . The aim current study evaluate efficacy alogliptin combination pioglitazone subject inadequately control thiazolidinedione ( pioglitazone rosiglitazone ) alone combination metformin sulfonylurea . Individuals participate study require commit screen visit 14 additional visit study center . Study participation anticipate 34 week ( 8.5 month ) .</detailed_description>
