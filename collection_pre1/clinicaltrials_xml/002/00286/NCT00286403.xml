	<brief_summary>Patients develop kidney failure open heart surgery experience abrupt decrease blood flow kidney . The investigator hypothesize administration fenoldopam mesylate ( drug increase blood flow kidney ) patient early course disease could reduce progression dialysis-dependent acute renal failure . The investigator also hypothesize restore blood flow could induce additional injury kidney release reactive oxygen specie . Therefore , patient protocol randomize receive fenoldopam anti-oxidant MESNA . The investigator hypothesize combination treatment Fenoldopam MESNA decrease incidence death dialysis 21 day patient early post-operative acute renal failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Hypotheses : - Combination therapy intravenous fenoldopam mesylate MESNA reduce incidence dialysis cause mortality 21 day patient establish acute tubular necrosis ( ATN ) . - The combination fenoldopam mesylate Intravenous MESNA reduce level reactive oxygen specie release follow restoration renal blood flow patient ischemic ATN . Specific Aims 1 . To conduct multicenter , double blind , trial compare efficacy 72-hour infusion fenoldopam mesylate combination fenoldopam plus intravenous MESNA reduce incidence dialysis all-cause mortality 21 day patient ischemic ATN . 2 . To determine effect fenoldopam mesylate alone combination MESNA reperfusion injury evidence change level urinary 15-F2t-isoprostanes The rational failure parenteral vasodilator reduce incidence death dialysis among patient ATN may involve extension tubular injury normalization renal blood flow subsequent reperfusion injury . Moreover , generation reactive oxidative specie area hypoxia could blunt impair regional blood flow kidney inhibition nitric oxide production . 3 . To serially measure urinary content ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 , KIM-1 , P-selectin , E-selectin , MCP-1and Cyr-61 determine ability specific marker identify patient progress dialysis dependent ATN . The rational ICAM-1 express ischemic endothelium facilitates neutrophile migration area necrotic epithelium . We determine whether rise urinary ICAM-1 identify patient progressive dialysis-dependent ATN . Specific aim # 3 also examine whether reduction dialysis cause mortality fenoldopam mesylate correlate reduce urinary expression ICAM-1 cell adhesion molecule . The serum , plasma , urine supernatant urinary cast obtain patient enrolled trial make available investigator involve study early ATN .</detailed_description>
