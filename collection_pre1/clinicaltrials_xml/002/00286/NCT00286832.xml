	<brief_summary>Early identification refractory lymphoma patient provide basis stratification responder standard approach non-responders may benefit early change alternative treatment strategy.Metabolic molecular image fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18F-FDG-PET ) emerge powerful imaging modality diagnosis , stag , therapy monitoring variety cancer . The primary hypothesis present study early response pinpoint PET reflect tumor burden activity , surrogate final outcome . An increase number study suggest potential role 18F-FDG PET stag monitoring lymphoma . The optimal timing PET scan potential role quantitative PET use SUV ass response chemotherapy remain define . Confirmation early 18F-FDG-PET significant predictor treatment response homogenous group aggressive lymphoma patient would potentially change prognosis patient allow early use alternative therapy discontinuation therapy lead significant tumour response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title : Evaluation response treatment use 18F-FDG positron emission tomography imaging ( PET ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma stage IIB-IV special emphasize prognostic significance early on-therapy PET first-line treatment Study design : Multicenter trial . Planned sample size : 100 patient . Number center : Denmark 2 ; Sweden 1 ; Norway 1 ; Finland 1 . Aim study : 1 . To evaluate prognostic significance PET early treatment initiation . 2 . To compare early PET standard response criterion NHL International Prognostic Index ( IPI ) prediction response outcome . Primary objective : The prognostic significance FDG-PET 1 cycle chemotherapy . End-points : Progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Overall survival ( OS ) . Response treatment ( standardize response criterion ) mid-treatment post-treatment . Inclusion criterion : Age ≥ 18 year . Newly diagnose consecutive patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) accord WHO classification . Ann Arbor stage IIB-IV . Written informed consent . Exclusion criterion : Previously treat chemotherapy irradiation . Previous malignant diagnosis except basal cell carcinoma cervical carcinoma situ . Pregnancy . Lactation . Diabetes mellitus . Extreme adipositas . Claustrophobia . Active inflammatory disease infection . PET-CT evaluation : PET CT primary stag initiation therapy PET one cycle intravenous chemotherapy ( day 10-20 ) mandatory . The result PET scan blind available local physician . If PET result open , patient exclude study . Only post-treatment PET scan allow outside protocol . The local physician may use post-treatment PET diagnostic therapeutic consideration . Only dedicate full-ring PET scanner allow study . Treatment : Therapy CHOP-like backbone accord local standard individual center . Treatment accord protocol allow .</detailed_description>
