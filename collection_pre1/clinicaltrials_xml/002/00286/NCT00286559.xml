	<detailed_description>Until today possible reliably assess function new bypass , i.e. , measure myocardial perfusion . Measuring intramyocardial blood flow directly revascularisation would greatly improve assessment graft function . With transthoracic contrast echocardiography myocardial perfusion reliably assess , show numerous study . As new transoesophageal ultrasound probe market allow contrast imaging , would like establish contrast echocardiography operate room patient undergo CABG surgery . Ultrasound contrast agent ( e.g. , SonoVue® , Optison® ) consist gas fill microspheres surround stabilize coat . They small red blood cell similar blood rheological habit . The microspheres inject peripheral central vein . They pass lung circulation disperse leave heart , coronary artery body circulation . A minute administration low-soluble gas microspheres exhale . The interaction ultrasound beam microspheres lead oscillation microspheres thereby amplification ultrasound signal . This technique allow enhancement endocardial border also visualization myocardial perfusion assessment myocardial blood flow reserve . The latter require measurement myocardial perfusion first time rest second time hyperemia adenosine . The quotient give myocardial flow reserve . This parameter paramount importance cardiology detect coronary artery stenosis reduce coronary myocardial flow reserve quantitatively . The contrast agent well adenosine ( natural purine nucleoside , find cell body ) good safety profile harmless transient side effect . Our patient anesthesia therefore feel none side effect . The study spread two part . In first part clarify methodological aspect contrast echocardiography : two different contrast agent three different contrast image method evaluate . One image method one contrast agent choose second part . In second part analyze validity contrast TEE operate room . In addition correlation change myocardial blood flow coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery improvement myocardial perfusion well global regional function follow-up SPECT ( Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ) transthoracic echocardiography , respectively evaluate . By mean data possibly able predict success revascularisation end surgery .</detailed_description>
