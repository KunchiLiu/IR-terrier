	<brief_title>Coronary Heart Disease Incidence : Depression &amp; Inflammation Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Classic risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) yet predict majority new case . Of novel risk factor recently explore , elevate depressive symptom find number prospective study predict new CHD case , inflammatory marker , include high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule . Interestingly , depression inflammatory marker high covariation , intervention study indicate reduce depression may reduce peripheral inflammation , successfully treat inflammation may ameliorate depressive symptom . It become critical know candidate CHD risk factor independent dependent prediction CHD incidence . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study determine depressive symptom inflammatory marker independent dependent CHD risk factor , control know CAD risk factor . A population-based prospective study ( Nova Scotia Health Survey ; NSHS95 ) conduct almost 10 year ago , participant randomly select socialized medical registry , include citizen . All classic CHD risk factor obtain baseline ( age , sex , race , fast lipid , diabetic status , family CHD history , rest blood pressure , exercise level , body mass index , smoke status , socioeconomic status ) . Depressive symptom assess Center Epidemiological Studies Depression scale also obtain baseline . Plasma blood sample obtain maintain -80 degree ( Celsius ) freezer . Participants give permission medical registry record link survey data , objectively document previous future CAD event could detect . The study assay plasma sample CRP , IL-6 ICAM-1 statistically model association among depression , inflammation CHD incidence .</detailed_description>
