	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Depression know associate increase risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , adverse outcome among old adult CHD . Recent evidence suggest depression also associate increase risk congestive heart failure , adverse outcome among old adult congestive heart failure . However , mechanisms depression lead congestive heart failure know DESIGN NARRATIVE : To determine mechanism association depression CHF , investigator use exist cohort 1024 old adult ( mean age 67 ) CHD ( include 680 heart failure 344 clinical subclinical heart failure ) recruit September 2000 December 2002 `` The Heart Soul Study . '' The Heart Soul Study originally design understand mechanism association depression CHD . Since patient CHD high risk CHF , well-characterized cohort provide unique opportunity examine relation depression CHF . At baseline , participant complete depression interview ( Diagnostic Interview Schedule ) ; full exercise treadmill test stress echocardiography ; 24-hour Holter monitor heart rate variability ; 24-hour urine collection cortisol norepinephrine ; venous blood measurement lipid , platelet reactivity , C-reactive protein ; extensive questionnaire . Participants follow annually telephone . The investigator invite participant return 5-year examination , follow additional 3 year thereafter , determine ( ) independent association baseline depression CHF , ( b ) extent 5-vear change biological behavioral factor associate depression explain relation depression CHF . By identify mechanism explain relation depression CHF , study enable target specific area improve treatment patient .</detailed_description>
