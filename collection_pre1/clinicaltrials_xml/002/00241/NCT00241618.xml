	<brief_summary>Spontaneous resolution acute hepatitis C infection predict majority case persist become chronic . This randomized trial ass efficacy safety peginterferon alfa-2b . The investigator hypothesize therapy strategy could prevent development chronic hepatitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Timing Duration Acute Hepatitis C Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With nearly 4 million people United States , estimate 170-200 million people worldwide , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) represent clear significant public health issue . Unfortunately , people infect HCV ( 70 % -85 % ) spontaneous resolution uncommon 60 % 80 % patient acute hepatitis C infection develop chronic hepatitis . This randomized trial focus define effect treatment acute HCV prevention chronic hepatitis addition optimization treatment regimen , onset length peginterferon alpha therapy acute hepatitis C infection . This randomized , multi-center prospective study ass efficacy peginterferon acute hepatitis . We also compare difference sustain viral response rate patient acute hepatitis C start treatment 8 , 12 , 24 week . We also compare efficacy 8 , 12 24 week therapy PEG-IFN-alpha . All eligible patient enrol screened initial observation period start time first positive HCV-RNA-PCR , bi-weekly serum ALT HCV-RNA subject perform . Patients resolve spontaneously ( loss HCV-RNA without treatment ) end observation period randomly assign receive PEG-IFN-alpha assign onset and/or duration . Patients consent therapy enrollment include non-randomized comparison group . All subject SVR follow 48 week follow-up 24 week SVR determine .</detailed_description>
