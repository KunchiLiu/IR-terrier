	<brief_title>Effects Behavioral Stress Reduction Programs Blood Pressure African American Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : African Americans ( AA ) experience high prevalence early onset essential hypertension ( EH ) , partly attribute exposure chronic environmental stress . AA youth exhibit high rest blood pressure ( BP ) white . Since BP rank track late childhood onward , AA adolescents high normal BP increase risk development EH . The need develop effective primary prevention program EH highlight fact EH pediatric problem due recent increase prevalence among youth . There previous control study evaluate stress reduction approach BP control AA youth , particularly within framework underlying psychological physiological-based model stress-induced EH . This study response 'Request Applications ' entitle `` Research Mind-Body Interactions Health , '' issue Office Director , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study examine effect two behavioral stress reduction program , MM LP , CTL cardiovascular function rest , laboratory stress , natural environment . Participants include 320 ninth grader ( 50 % male ) high normal systolic BP ( SBP ) ( SBP range great equal 50th percentile less equal 95th percentile three occasion ) . Following BP screening baseline evaluation , participant assign CTL , MM , LP , MM plus LP group . Participants re-evaluated 12-week intervention 12-week follow-up . The specific aim study determine whether MM and/or LP result follow : 1 ) decrease primary outcome variable rest SBP 24-hour ambulatory SBP ; 2 ) decrease sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) tone ( decrease overnight urine norepinephrine [ NE ] excretion ) decrease sodium intake ( decreased overnight sodium excretion ) ; 3 ) decrease SBP reactivity behavioral stressor ; 4 ) decrease SNS arousal ( decreased urinary NE excretion ) great increase renal function ( increased urinary sodium excretion ) behavioral stressor ; 5 ) decrease self-reported hostility anger ; 6 ) improvement vascular function ( increases percent endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation reactive hyperemia ) ; 7 ) improvement ventricular structure function ( decrease leave ventricular mass index rest heart rate ) . It anticipate combination MM LP result great positive impact either treatment alone . The study conduct teacher school health class . If program show successful , may incorporate regular school curriculum .</detailed_description>
