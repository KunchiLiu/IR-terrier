	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Prospective Investigation Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis III ( PIOPED III ) follow PIOPED I PIOPED II . PIOPED I multicenter trial support 1983 1989 evaluate sensitivity specificity two major , widely use technology , radionuclear image ( ventilation-perfusion scanning ) pulmonary angiography , diagnosis PE . PIOPED II multicenter trial conduct 2000 2005 determine value contrast-enhanced spiral compute tomography ( spiral CT ) diagnosis acute PE . In PIOPED II , among 7,284 patient suspect acute PE , 18.6 % elevated creatinine , 3.9 % allergic iodinate contrast material , 4.7 % woman pregnant . One relative contraindication image procedure would expose patient ionize radiation iodinate contrast material present 24.4 % patient suspect acute PE . Although patient relative contraindication often take risk CT digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) importance definitive diagnosis , patient could benefit safe diagnostic test Gd-MRA/MRV show sufficiently accurate . The purpose investigation determine extent Gd-MRA/MRV serve diagnostic test patient clinically suspect PE thereby eliminate need iodinate contrast material ionize radiation patient relative contraindication one . This important 24 % patient suspect acute PE relative contraindication diagnostic procedure involve ionize radiation iodinate contrast material . DESIGN NARRATIVE : PIOPED III multicenter prospective investigation design determine diagnostic accuracy Gd-MRA pulmonary artery combination MRV vein thighs patient clinically suspect acute PE . The diagnostic accuracy Gd-MRA alone combination MRV express sensitivity , specificity , likelihood ratio positive negative test . The study design prospective study consecutive patient incorporate standardized inclusion/exclusion criterion , complete ascertainment patient characteristic outcome , uniform diagnostic criterion , unbiased paired central reading image study . Over period 2 year , 1,256 patient suspect acute PE recruit clinical center . Composite reference standard use diagnose venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) exclude PE . It expect 314 patient acute VTE undergo Gd-MRA/MRV . It expect 942 patient show PE . From among group , 314 patient randomly select index test , Gd-MRA/MRV .</detailed_description>
