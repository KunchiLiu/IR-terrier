	<brief_summary>The global burden COPD − common debilitate chronic inflammatory disease characterise progressive development airflow limitation ( shortness breath − SOB ) poorly reversible currently available drug −is increase . Cigarette smoke strongly link ongoing inflammation ; inflammation continue even patient stop smoke . The severity airflow limitation ( SOB ) correlate degree pulmonary ( lung ) inflammation . Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) important molecule suppress pulmonary inflammation . We recently show patient COPD reduction total HDAC correlate severity lung disease . Corticosteroids ( anti−inflammatory treatment ) act , least part , recruitment HDACs site active inflammatory gene transcription ( reduces production inflammatory molecule ) widely use COPD patient severe disease . Unfortunately , COPD , inhale corticosteroid seem little effect underlie inflammation ( though selective group patient COPD reduce number infection patient may small amount ) . Theophylline use treatment asthma COPD 70 year , use recently decline . Data far obtain primary cell ( cell patient used laboratory ) COPD patient suggest low dose theophylline ( ~5mg/l ) effective restore steroid sensitivity patient COPD ( hence reduce inflammation thus improve SOB ) . We wish therefore continue study theophylline principally conduct small clinical pilot study 20−30 COPD patient randomise , double−blind , placebo−controlled , parallel−group study .</brief_summary>

These patient also unlikely severe enough disease ( therefore airway inflammation ) may modify therapeutic agent study . Patients FEV1 &lt; 30 % tend severe symptom limitation generally ( though always ) find participation clinical trial involve 4 visit clinic difficult . Their airway disease also generally less responsive therapeutic intervention consequence find measurement show change therapeutic intervention difficult .
