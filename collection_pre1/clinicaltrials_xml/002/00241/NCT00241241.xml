	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Pegylated Interferon Alfa Polycythemia Vera</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim PV treatment reduce risk vascular thrombosis without enhance long-term risk evolution toward myelofibrosis MDS/AL . Although currently controversial , phlebotomy show old PVSG01 study increase risk thrombosis myelofibrosis . On hand , currently available cytoreductive treatment show efficiently reduce thrombotic risk , demonstrate ( 32P , busulfan , chlorambucil ) suspect ( pipobroman , hydroxyurea ) enhance risk evolution MDS/AL . In fact , main widely use cytoreductive treatment , indicate , hydroxyurea ( HU ) . This drug efficient control myeloproliferation response rate 80 90 % . It generally well tolerate , even long term toxicity lead treatment change 10 % case . Although prospective study yet clearly demonstrate leukemogenic potential PV , non-leukemogenic alternative treatment highly warrant , especially young patient . Interferon ( IFN ) alpha promise agent PV good efficacy absence leukemogenic risk . Expanded experience IFN-alpha recently report , show control erythrocytosis approximately 75 % patient . A similar percentage patient also resolution disease-related symptom , particular reduction spleen size relief intractable pruritus . In case , long-term persisting remission treatment discontinuation observe well demonstration eradication myeloproliferative clone . However , 20 % patient may tolerate treatment side effect . Furthermore , treatment schedule ( three time per week administration ) may factor reduce long-term compliance drug . In regard , pegylated-IFN could major drug PV . The weekly administration well tolerance comparison IFN report hepatitis patient could allow obtain result similar chemotherapy term compliance treatment efficacy , major advantage , lack mutagenicity .</detailed_description>
