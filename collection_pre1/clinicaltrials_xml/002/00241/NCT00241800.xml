	<brief_title>Medications Risk Sudden Cardiac Death</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There 400,000 sudden cardiac death annually U.S , 85 % cause ventricular tachyarrhythmias . Medications important modifiable risk factor many effect provoke lethal arrhythmia . There increase suspicion several drug four widely use class non-cardiovascular medications-fluoroquinolone macrolide antibiotic , antipsychotic , antidepressants- pro-arrhythmic thus increase risk sudden cardiac death . Published epidemiologic study quantify risk confer old antipsychotic antidepressant well oral erythromycin . The current project extend study newer medication use estimate 20 % adult U.S. Studies surrogate marker suggest pro-arrhythmic effect drug vary markedly . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This retrospective cohort study three specific aim test relationship certain non-cardiovascular medications-fluoroquinolone macrolide antibiotic , antipsychotic , antidepressants- sudden cardiac death.. Specific aim 1 test hypothesis correspond variation risk sudden cardiac death . In vivo data suggest concurrent use study drug common medication inhibit metabolism could markedly increase drug concentration , thus risk arrhythmia . Specific aim 2 test hypothesis pharmacokinetic interaction , define priori , increase risk sudden cardiac death . The hypokalemia cause commonly use potassium-wasting diuretic may amplify pro-arrhythmic effect medication . Specific aim 3 test hypothesis concurrent use study drug diuretic increase risk sudden cardiac death . The investigator conduct retrospective cohort study TennCare , Tennessee 's expanded Medicaid program . Computerized TennCare file , link death certificate , provide information necessary define cohort , classify followup accord medication exposure potential confounders , identify case sudden cardiac death use validate computer case definition develop . The cohort include estimate 800,000 person 15,000 sudden cardiac death 5,000,000 person year followup thus excellent power risk estimate . The study provide data clinician need prescribe widely use medication way minimize risk sudden cardiac death .</detailed_description>
