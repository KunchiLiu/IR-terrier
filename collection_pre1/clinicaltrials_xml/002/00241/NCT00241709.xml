	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In racially admixed population , genetic association may confound population stratification . To control population stratification , statistical method use marker genotype data infer population structure propose alternative family-based test association . However , limited empirical data method perform real population . This study use well characterized population Mexican Puerto Rican asthmatic , parent , control subject recruit site examine effectiveness approach correct effect population stratification case-control genetic association study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study three specific aim : 1 ) To test compare method detect correct population stratification , study genotype total 100 ancestral informative marker ( AIMs ) 400 asthma case equal number control subject . These AIMs use three statistical method develop detect correct population stratification . The number characteristic marker require correct false positive association AIMs , asthma , asthma quantitative trait evaluate compare ; 2 ) To compare power genomically adjust case-control study Transmission Disequilibrium Test ( TDT ) . An allele 100 AIMs consider risk factor simulate `` phenotype . '' The association phenotypes AIM test TDT case-control analysis adjustment stratification compare false negative rate study design . 3 ) To use result aim 1 2 define optimal approach analysis interpretation case-control association study populations apply approach analyze association asthma series candidate gene . The result study provide important insight optimal method control population stratification case-control association study , thereby facilitate inclusion admix population future genetic study complex disease asthma .</detailed_description>
