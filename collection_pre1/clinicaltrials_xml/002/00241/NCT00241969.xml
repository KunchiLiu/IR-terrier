	<detailed_description>Evidence-based nutritional intervention achieve sustain optimal growth young child cystic fibrosis ( CF ) exist , despite urgent need . Such intervention could positively change course clinical lung disease enhance survival child . The primary objective NIH fund clinical trial conduct multi-center , randomize , control trial compare two intervention : behavioral plus nutrition intervention nutrition ( attention control ) intervention . All subject receive nutritional care consistent 2001 CF Consensus Conference guideline pediatric nutrition . The specific aim : 1. determine impact behavioral intervention energy intake weight gain ; 2. examine durability behavioral intervention 's impact growth ( weight height ) one year follow treatment ; 3. explore relation physical activity growth . The central hypothesis behavioral intervention lead well growth measure change weight height age z score . From three CF Centers Ohio , ( Cincinnati Children 's , Columbus Children 's , Rainbow Babies Children 's Hospital Cleveland ) , two referral center Ohio ( Dayton Children 's Akron Children 's ) , one CF Center Michigan ( University Michigan-Ann Arbor ) , one CF Center Arizona ( University Arizona-Tucson ) , 100 preschooler CF pancreatic insufficiency age 2 6 year randomize one two condition . The two group stratify similar initiation treatment weight age z score . Other critical variable history Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection gender use covariates statistical analysis plan . Outcome data ( energy intake measure 7-day diet record , weight , height ) obtain baseline , post-treatment ( 6 month ) , 12-month follow-up ( 18 month post baseline ) . Secondary measure include body mass index , body composition measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) skinfolds , growth velocity . Behavioral treatment maximize adherence high energy diet enzyme replacement therapy , motivate child increase energy intake . It involve 7 weekly session follow 4 monthly session . The attention condition control time contact number assessment conduct . This study advance investigation early nutritional intervention young child CF directly address need control , longitudinal assessment behavioral intervention growth . The long-range goal change standard nutritional care young child CF behavioral intervention lead optimal growth ultimately improve lung health survival .</detailed_description>
