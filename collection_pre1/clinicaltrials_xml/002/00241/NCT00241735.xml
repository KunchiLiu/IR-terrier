	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) lead cause death US many country . Estrogen deficiency play significant role development coronary heart disease ( CHD ) postmenopausal woman . Recently , series randomize clinical trial evaluate effect hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) CHD yield surprisingly deleterious result , shift clinical decision-making position presume benefit one potential harm . Soy food emerge promising natural substitute HRT , give estrogenic property potential lipid benefit . However , data directly link soy food intake clinical endpoint CHD lack . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study evaluate association soy food consumption CHD use resource Shanghai Women 's Health Study ( SWHS ) , ongoing prospective cohort study 75,000 Chinese woman recruit 1997 2000 complete two extensive dietary assessment baseline . The investigator verify CHD event identify cohort follow-up longitudinally analyze association soy food intake CHD risk , overall , accord conventional CHD risk factor . In addition , conduct nest case-control study evaluate association urinary isoflavonoids ( biomarker soy intake ) risk CHD , investigate whether soy CHD association modify baseline level lipid plasma C-reactive protein , two well establish risk marker CHD . In United States , sale soy product increase 3-fold recent decade , proportion people report soy product consumption least week nearly double last six year . However , overall intake level soy food US population still low , woman consume soy food regularly likely highly selective . Furthermore , difficult , possible , assess usual soy food intake US population soy protein add many American food product . Informative study association soy food intake CHD risk well conduct Chinese Asian population , soy food part traditional dietary practice . The SWHS wealth data dietary lifestyle factor biological sample provide unique unparalleled opportunity prospectively investigate effect soy food intake risk CHD , identify likely benefit consumption soy food .</detailed_description>
