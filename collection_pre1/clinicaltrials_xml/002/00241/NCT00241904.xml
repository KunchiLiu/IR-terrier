	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study base premise community-based participatory research partnership model , use team advance practice nurse case manager , community health worker ( CHW ) , physician translate urban community clinic improve quality care reduce disparity cardiovascular health minority underserved population . Despite well-publicized guideline appropriate management cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) type 2 diabetes , implementation CVD risk-reducing practice remain poor . In spite know benefit lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level 100 mg/dl person exist heart disease , many 50 70 percent eligible CVD patient place lipid-lowering therapy provider 20 80 percent patient achieve goal therapy . The benefit control high blood pressure ( HBP ) well establish , yet national rate HBP control remain 31 percent despite decade provider patient education . In addition , well establish control glycemia , hyperlipidemia , blood pressure reduce risk vascular complication people diabetes , 75 percent die form heart blood vessel disease . This randomized trial compare clinical effectiveness cost effectiveness CI intervention LI intervention African American , white low-income patient know excessive CVD risk . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Eligible patient CVD type 2 diabetes randomly select two urban federally fund community clinic randomly assign receive either 1 ) Cl intervention deliver nurse practitioner , CHW , patient 's physician , focus behavioral intervention affect therapeutic lifestyle change medication adherence well prescription titration medication 2 ) LI intervention provide feedback CVD risk factor guideline patient physician . Outcomes measure baseline one two year . It hypothesize high proportion patient Cl intervention group achieve treatment goal lipid , blood pressure , diabetes management , lifestyle behavior utilization antiplatelet agent , beta blocker , angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor therapy Cl intervention cost-effective . Secondary outcome include assessment impact Cl intervention model patient ' satisfaction care health care utilization . The increase percentage high-risk woman men receive recommend secondary prevention therapy achieve goal level could potentially result marked decrement annual CVD mortality health disparity apply within primary care setting population characteristic target group study .</detailed_description>
