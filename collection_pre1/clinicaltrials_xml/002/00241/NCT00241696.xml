	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Ambient air pollution well accept cause asthma exacerbation , role etiology new onset asthma less clear . Evidence etiologic role ambient air pollutant emerge epidemiologic study ; however , ecologic pattern increase asthma prevalence concurrent decreasing level pollutant raise question validity association . A good understanding biological process mediate effect ambient air pollution asthma occurrence likely contribute answer question . Chronic oxidative/nitrosative stress airway inflammation probably critical process asthma etiology inter-related process may mediate increase asthma risk air pollution . This study build exist Asthma Incidence Risk ( AIR ) study ongoing cohort study consist 6000 child new onset asthma . The child live 12 community Southern California . The community choose give range key ambient air pollutant ozone , small particulate , NOx , acid vapor tailpipe emission . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use exhale nitric oxide ( eNO ) investigate role inflammation oxidative/nitrosative stress pathobiology new onset asthma , focus ambient air pollution genetic susceptibility . The investigator choose ambient pollutant base potential contribution oxidative/nitrosative stress ( O3 ; particulate ( PM10 PM2.5 chemical constituent , particle count , NOx ( NO NO2 ) , acid vapor ; fresh tailpipe emission ) . The primary hypothesis assess program research : 1 ) child high ambient air pollution exposures chronic airway inflammation indicate elevated eNO . 2 ) susceptibility airway inflammation oxidative/nitrosative stress ambient air pollution varies NOS1 , NOS2 . NOS3 . GSTM1 . GSTP1 . NQO1 , HO-1 haplotypes functional variant , 3 ) child chronic airway inflammation indicate elevated eNO increase risk new onset asthma . To test hypothesis , study build population resource Asthma Incidence Risk ( AIR ) study , ongoing prospective cohort study determinants new onset asthma 6000 child 13 southern California community , extensive program ambient air pollution exposure characterization community . The investigator measure eNO use off-line technique genotype 3000 child AIR cohort . A number resource enhance study , include Children 's Environmental Health Center , Molecular Biology Core Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center , expertise Southern California Particle Center Supersite .</detailed_description>
