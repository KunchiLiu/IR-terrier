	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cerivastatin ( Baycol ) , HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) , approve market early 1998 treatment dyslipidemias . Soon afterwards , suspected adverse drug reaction ( SADR ) report cerivastatin user often cite rhabdomyolysis , uncommon condition breakdown skeletal muscle cell cause pain , weakness , in-some case , renal failure death . By time cerivastatin withdrawn market 2001 , FDA receive 1,899 SADRs rhabdomyolysis associate cerivastatin compare 1,440 statin combine . In analysis conduct FDA scientist , relative reporting rate ( RRR ) fatal rhabdomyolysis 40 time high among user cerivastatin among user statin . For outcome fatal non-fatal rhabdomyolysis , RRR 54 time higher . About half rhabdomyolysis case occur subject take cerivastatin gemfibrozil . Subsequently , pharmacokinetic study demonstrate gemfibrozil inhibits major metabolic pathway cerivastatin-not Cytochrome P-450 ( CYP ) 2C8-mediated oxidation , also glucuronidation uridine diphosphate glucuronysyltransferases ( UGT ) . The investigator hypothesize rhabdomyolysis case take cerivastatin gemfibrozil one two type risk factor : ( 1 ) medication know inhibitor enzyme ; ( 2 ) functional genetic variant one CYP UGT enzymes . Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) lead cause morbidity mortality U.S. statin agent commonly employ treatment hyperlipidemia , one principal risk factor CHD . Given hundred thousand million Americans presently statin therapy , potentially serious ( though relatively rare ) complication rhabdomyolysis , significant topic study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator hypothesize rhabdomyolysis case take cerivastatin gemfibrozil one two type risk factor : ( 1 ) medication know inhibitor enzyme ; ( 2 ) functional genetic variant one CYP UGT enzymes . This project case-control study factor increase risk rhabdomyolysis cerivastatin user . Cases cerivastatin user rhabdomyolysis , statin user two on-going epidemiologic study serve two complementary control group . `` For case , identify assistance attorney , review medical record telephone interview verify diagnosis provide information medication use . Subjects also return mouthwash buccal sample DNA extraction . All subject genotyped know functional variant CYP2C8 , UGT1A1 UGT1A3 . In hypothesis-testing part case-control study , medication know inhibitor enzymes functional variant gene evaluate risk factor rhabdomyolysis cerivastatin user . Additionally , pharmacoepidemiologic analysis FDA AERS data conduct identify potential new drug-drug interaction . Power detect expect effect size 80 % great . In discovery phase project , DNA rhabdomyolysis case take gemfibrozil sequence identify new single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) CYP2C8 , UGT1 Al UGT1 A3 . The functional significance new pharmacoepidemiologic association evaluate vitro pharmacokinetic inhibition study . Additionally , newly discover SNPs CYP2C8 express E. coli evaluate functional significance .</detailed_description>
