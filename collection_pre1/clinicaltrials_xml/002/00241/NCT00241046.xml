	<brief_summary>The course disease female patient metastatic mammary carcinoma vary greatly . In connection , individual prognosis depend complex interaction tumor- patient-related factor . To take account difference , necessary employ individual method treatment suit course patient 's disease . Prof. Possinger Dr. Schmid ( Charite Berlin ) Prof. Wischnewsky ( University Bremen ) develop approach help achieve goal aid computerize machine learn technique ( MLT ) . The use machine learn method beneficial oncology two respect . On one hand , attempt make individually estimate clinically relevant parameter like , example , recurrence probability expect survival time precisely possible base establish prognostic factor . And hand , may possible aid MLT understand structural relationship clinical result measure establish tumor-/patient-related variable . To analyze possible benefit machine learn technique patient metastatic breast cancer , aim study FEM-D-2 investigate whether possible characterize patient either respond specific treatment precision 90 % , prospectively estimate time worsen disease give treatment , classify patient group favorable poor chance medium-term survival . The use inductive learning algorithms machine learning also make possible accurately estimate time progression tumor growth . In patient respond letrozole therapy , time tumor progression depend factor like pain , age , body mass index , disease-free interval , main localization metastatic spread , response previous estrogen therapy . Only minimal difference find compare actual time progression disease calculate system ( least survival time &lt; 1 year ) . Furthermore , use machine learn technique become possible use initial data assess letrozole treatment estimate survival time distinguish patient high risk die soon patient favorable prognosis .</brief_summary>
