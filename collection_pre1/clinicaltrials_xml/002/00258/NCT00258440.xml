	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Epoetin alfa may cause body make red blood cell . It use treat anemia cause cancer chemotherapy . It may also help relieve fatigue patient anemia . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study well epoetin alfa work treat patient anemia undergoing chemotherapy cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epoetin Alfa Treating Patients With Anemia Who Are Undergoing Chemotherapy Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy , term maintenance target hemoglobin hematocrit level , interval dose epoetin alfa treat patient anemia undergoing chemotherapy nonhematologic cancer . Secondary - Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug patient . - Correlate hemoglobin hematocrit response patient age ( &gt; 65 year vs &lt; 65 year ) patient treat drug . - Determine quality life patient treated drug . - Determine adverse effect drug patient . - Determine change time symptom quality life variable ( e.g. , fatigue ) patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This partially randomize , pilot study . Patients stratify accord age ( &lt; 65 year vs â‰¥ 65 year ) . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group base participation pharmacokinetic ( PK ) portion study . - Group 1 ( PK study , initial therapy ) : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Five patient receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously ( SC ) weekly . Treatment continue 24 week absence unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Five patient receive epoetin alfa SC weekly hematocrit &gt; 36 % OR hemoglobin reach value 12 g/dL . Patients proceed maintenance therapy . Patients arm also undergo PK sample periodically study treatment . - Group 2 ( non-PK study , initial therapy ) : Fifteen patient receive epoetin alfa SC weekly hematocrit &gt; 36 % OR hemoglobin reach value 12 g/dL . Patients proceed maintenance therapy . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive epoetin alfa SC every week 24 week total treatment ( include initial therapy maintenance therapy ) . Patients whose blood count fall critical level place weekly dose schedule . Patients whose blood count rise high discontinue study drug blood count reduce . Quality life ( include fatigue ) assess baseline every 4 week 28 week . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
