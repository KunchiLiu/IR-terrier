	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Cisplatin fluorouracil may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving radiation therapy together combination therapy gefitinib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give radiation therapy together combination chemotherapy gefitinib surgery work treat patient advanced esophageal gastroesophageal junction cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine activity gefitinib , term median survival distant metastatic disease control , patient treat neoadjuvant adjuvant cisplatin , fluorouracil , radiotherapy undergoing surgery esophageal gastroesophageal junction cancer . Secondary - Determine pathologic complete partial response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient patient disease free receive long-term maintenance gefitinib . OUTLINE : - Preoperative regimen : Patients undergo radiotherapy twice day day 1-12 ( total 10 treatment day ) . Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously cisplatin IV continuously day 1-4 . Patients also receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 . At 6 week , patient locoregionally confine disease undergo surgical resection proceed postoperative regimen . Patients medical contraindication surgery proceed directly postoperative regimen . - Postoperative regimen : Beginning 4-10 week surgery 6 week complete first course therapy , patient undergo radiotherapy receive fluorouracil cisplatin preoperative regimen . - Maintenance regimen : Patients receive oral gefitinib begin day 1 postoperative regimen continue 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
