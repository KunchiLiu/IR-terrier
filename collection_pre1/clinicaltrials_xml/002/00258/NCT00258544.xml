	<detailed_description>Subjects ask participate research study investigate way lung damage condition call pulmonary fibrosis . These research study conduct laboratory portion tissue subject 's lung biopsy perform surgeon . The lung biopsy perform clinical purpose diagnose cause subject 's lung disease . The tissue use research study way interfere ability pathologist establish diagnosis . In addition , result breathe test , chest X-rays CT scan , diagnosis make lung biopsy ( slide ) collect . The goal study gain understanding cause pulmonary fibrosis get bad , may ultimately lead new therapy disease . Once lung biopsy obtain , pathologist examine tissue determine sufficient amount available use study without compromise ability make diagnosis . If , lung biopsy divide . One portion submit research study process pathologist usual manner make diagnosis . The decision use tissue research study complete discretion pathologist . The tissue use study process laboratory order analyze presence genetic marker scar tissue present normal . The identification unique genetic marker scar lung may ultimately lead new approach diagnosis treatment pulmonary fibrosis .</detailed_description>
