	<brief_summary>This study test safety well body 's immune system respond live , weaken varicella ( chickenpox ) vaccine , know Varivax , give without ProQuad , another measles , mumps , rubella , varicella virus vaccine ( MMR-II ) . One hundred five healthy child enrol study 12 month old . All subject vaccinate 12 month age subject receive second vaccination 18 month age . All subject participate 1 year . This study single-site , two-year trial post-licensure vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This clinical trial phase I/II exploratory immunogenicity safety study live attenuate Varicella ( Varivax ) , Measles-Mumps-Rubella ( MMR-II ) , combination Varicella/Measles , Mumps/Rubella ( Pro-Quad ) vaccine administer healthy child 12 18 month age . A total 105 healthy child , 12 month old time study entry , recruit Palo Alto Medical Foundation clinic Palo Alto , Fremont Los Altos , California . The study design focus time primary Varivax immunization immunologic benefit two-dose vaccine regimen compare single Varivax dose . In addition , investigator evaluate use Varivax without concomitant administration MMR-II , measure immunologic response two-dose MMR-II regimen . The first study objective determine immunogenicity one dose Varivax administer 12 versus 18 month age . Participants receive either MMR vaccine Varivax , ProQuad depend availability vaccine . Immunogenicity measure humoral response utilize plaque reduction neutralization ( PRN ) assay measles gpELISA varicella antibody , T cell immunity determine flow cytometric T cell assay . The second study objective determine immunogenicity administer two dos Varivax MMR-II child 12 18 month age compare child receive one dose MMR-II 12 month one dose Varivax 12 18 month age . Participants receive either MMR vaccine Varivax , ProQuad depend availability vaccine . The third study objective determine safety administer two dos Varivax MMR-II child 12 18 month age . Participants receive either MMR vaccine Varivax , ProQuad depend availability vaccine . Study personnel documentation adverse event serious adverse event monitor safety use parental memory aid telephone follow-up . The investigator hypothesize infant receive Varivax ProQuad 12 month age comparable humoral immune response infant receive vaccine 18 month age , T cell immunity high vaccinate 18 month age . In addition , infant receive 2 dos Varivax ProQuad high humoral cell mediate immune response compare child receive one dose Varivax ProQuad . This hypothesis would explain post-licensure observation breakthrough disease high vaccinate 12 versus 15 month age child receive one vaccination compare two . The investigator predict difference humoral immune response measles give concomitantly Varivax compare Varivax alone , immunosuppressive effect measles virus influence effect T cell immunity . It expect two dos Varivax Proquad well tolerate few systemic adverse reaction second dose . The Varivax package insert report incidence injection site redness swell slightly high post dose 2 , incidence systemic clinical complaint low post dose 2 . The incidence adverse experience locally systemically follow second dose ProQuad equal le reaction see first dose . The investigator evaluate incidence injection site reactogenicity confirm finding .</detailed_description>
