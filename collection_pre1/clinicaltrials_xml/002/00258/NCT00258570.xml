	<brief_title>Genetic Polymorphisms Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis one collection severe lung disease lead abnormal inflammation scar lung . The accumulation scar tissue lung destroy normal lung tissue result symptom associated disease . The cause disease currently unknown . In study , attempt determine specific genetic trait might explain patient developed pulmonary fibrosis . We also attempt determine specific genetic trait account differ pattern inflammation scar tissue form patient 's lung . The purpose research identify gene control process lung inflammation , lung scarring , lung repair . As information become available , also conduct study additional gene find involved disease process .</detailed_description>
