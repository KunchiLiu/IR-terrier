	<brief_summary>Malaria one major cause illness mortality Sub-Saharan Africa . In Ghana , malaria important cause morbidity account 40 % outpatient contact . Chemoprophylaxis insecticide-impregnated bed net use malaria control pregnancy.Chloroquine administer within ANC package health facility Ghana . However , many pregnant woman rural , low-income community report ANC report late thereby increase risk morbidity mortality . Reasons include inaccessibility high cost . As gap urban rural health care socioeconomic circumstance increase , malaria control remain major challenge health sector . A facility-based intervention alone sufficient significant sustain impact malaria control pregnancy . Alternative strategy need delivery malaria intervention pregnant woman rural area Ghana . The overall objective study develop alternative strategy community involvement delivery malaria intervention pregnant woman rural Ghana . The project conduct Afigya Sekyere district Ashanti Region Ghana . Interviews focus group discussion conduct pregnant woman community member focus local knowledge control malaria pregnancy factor influence utilization antenatal service . Women first second pregnancy permanently resident study area include study use IPT sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) . The study population randomize : Group 1 receive clinic-supervised IPT-SP daily folate/iron supplementation Group 2 access IPT-SP daily folate/iron supplementation train traditional birth attendant ( TBA ) . Midwives TBAs train prepare thick blood smear placenta biopsy parasitological examination . Parasitaemia Hb measure entry delivery fever episodes pregnancy record . Study participant follow adverse reaction within week drug administration . The effectiveness community-based IPT control malaria pregnancy determine . The endpoint study birth weight , maternal anaemia , fever episodes prevalence peripheral placental parasitaemia group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General Objective To evaluate alternative strategy community involvement control pregnancy associate malaria anaemia area intense malaria transmission Ghana . Specific Objectives To explore local knowledge health-care practice control malaria pregnancy determine factor influence utilization antenatal service pregnant woman . To determine prevalence malaria anaemia pregnancy Afigya Sekyere district To determine effect intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy outcome primigravida secundigravidae To evaluate effectiveness health facility community-based malaria intervention first second pregnancy Methodology Study area population The study conduct Afigya Sekyere district Ashanti Region Ghana . The district lie within forest belt malaria prevalence high ( AHMED , 1989 ) . Mean temperature 270C annual rainfall 1500 2000mm . The major rainfall season March-July minor September - November . There little seasonal variation malaria parasite transmission rate slightly high rain . Most inhabitant peasant farmers.The district divide six sub district 91 communities.It 15 health facility ( 2 hospital , 6 health centre , 2 clinic 5 maternity home ) . The district 42 train ( TTBAs ) number untrained TBAs conduct almost 30 % delivery district ( DHA , 2002 ) .Considering inadequate number health professional couple exodus developed country , capability TBAs enhance use control malaria pregnancy . Study Design Pre-intervention phase A baseline Survey birth weight carry determine mean birth weight birth weight distribution study area Qualitative data collection Focus group discussion ( FGDs ) interview conduct health facility community explore local knowledge control malaria pregnancy social , cultural economic factor influence utilization antenatal delivery service pregnant woman . This involve pregnant woman parity , village health committee member , TBAs opinion leader . Cross-sectional Survey ( determination prevalence parasitaemia anaemia ) A cross-sectional survey conduct determine prevalence parasitaemia anaemia among pregnant woman district . Pregnant woman randomly select health institution six community . The sample health facility woman use exit interview . Twenty percent pregnant woman six community use . Their blood sample take parasitaemia rate density haemoglobin level measure use Haemocue . Intervention phase This phase involve Community-based Health Facility-based administration single-dose SP ( 1500/75mg ) pregnant woman assess effect follow outcome : Birth weight Anaemia Parasitaemia Fever episodes Sample Size:420 woman first second pregnancy . Selection field sit train staff Using random sampling , 20 TTBAs select community without health facility . Six health facility also purposively select field site . Two field supervisor ( FS ) employ help study . They train data collection , interview , monitor drug administration , prepare blood smear , check haemoglobin weigh baby . A one-week training session organize select TTBAs . They train : Drug storage administration Interviewing Recognizing imminent complication pregnancy Taking placenta biopsy make thick blood smear Weighing baby Record keep A one-day meeting also hold head health institution midwives district brief study solicit support . Midwives 10 select health facility later train : Taking placental biopsy make thick blood smear Haemoglobin measurement Interviewing Record keep 3 ) Enrolment Study Participants The inclusion criterion phase woman : primigravida secundigravidae Hb &gt; 7g/dl ( Those Hb 7g/dl treat later enrol ) permanently resident district reaction sulpha drug multiple pregnancy chronic diseases Midwives TTBAs recruit woman ANCs community , confirm non-palpable pregnancy test urine interview reaction sulpha drug . The researcher , laboratory technician FS visit field site , gather background information woman check gestation , haemoglobin parasitaemia level obtain baseline data woman . Eligible woman give consent sign thumb-printing consent form enrol study give identification card . They advise present card midwife anytime visit antenatal clinic antimalarial give prophylaxis . 3 ) Drug administration Group 1 - Health Facility Intervention ( HFI ) Midwife supervise IPT daily iron folate supplementation . Women group receive single-dose treatment sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( 1500/75mg ) twice second trimester least one month apart third trim visit antenatal clinic . This begin 16 week gestation . They also receive daily iron folate supplementation . They inform immediately report health facility adverse effect might experience . Group 2- Community-Based Intervention ( CBI ) TTBA supervise IPT daily iron folate supplementation . Women category receive sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( 1500/75mg ) daily iron folate supplementation 16 week gestation . Two dose anti-malarial take second trimester least one month apart third dose early third trimester supervision TTBA . The woman instruct immediately report adverse reaction health facility TTBA , record . The TTBAs encourage promptly refer woman imminent complication health facility appropriate treatment . 4 ) Laboratory investigation The midwife , TTBAs FS regular supply slide , slide box , glove , cotton wool methanol prepare store blood smear placenta biopsy . All blood sample midwives TTBAs collect weekly FS transport Kwame Nkrumah University Science Technology process microscopic examination laboratory technician . Haemoglobin parasitaemia value compare group . Ten ( 10 % ) percent slide read Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital Kumasi quality control . 5 ) Delivery Scales provide TTBAs health facility without reliable scale weigh baby record birth weight . There regular monitoring visit researcher FS ensure accurate record birth weight . Providers supply form notebook record keep . The birth weight two group compare . 6 ) Referrals A follow-up made record woman develop pregnancy-related complication refer health facility outside district . Ethical consideration 1 . Ethical clearance study seek follow : - Committee Human Research Publications Ethics School Medical Sciences , KNUST . - Ashanti Regional Health Administration ( ARHA ) - Afigya Sekyere DHMT . - Danish Central Ethical Committee 2 . Eligible woman ask give consent participation confidentiality information gather ensure . 3 . Women develop pregnancy-related complication would refer health facility equip handle case cost treatment borne project . All health facility in-charges inform .</detailed_description>
