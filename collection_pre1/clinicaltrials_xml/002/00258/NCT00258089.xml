	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Oral Levofloxacin Compared With Oral Ciprofloxacin Treatment Complicated Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levofloxacin antibacterial agent use treatment many type acute infection adult . This randomized , double-blind study safety effectiveness levofloxacin compare ciprofloxacin treatment adult complicate urinary tract infection . Complicated urinary tract infection include associate fever , chill , kidney involvement anatomic functional abnormality bladder . Patients one group treat 250 mg levofloxacin take daily 10 day , group treat 500 mg ciprofloxacin , also antibacterial agent , take twice daily 10 day . Patients follow 5 9 day completion treatment ( post-therapy ) ass clinical sign symptom infection . Long-term follow ( 4 6 week end treatment ) patient respond therapy provide evaluation clinical sign symptom . The primary assessment effectiveness include microbiological response ( eradication post-therapy infectious organism identify start study ) clinical response ( resolution sign symptoms post-therapy compare start study ) . An additional assessment efficacy include overall clinical response , describe cure , improve , fail . Safety assessment include incidence adverse event throughout study , clinical laboratory test ( hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis ) physical examination start study post-therapy . The study hypothesis levofloxacin least effective therapeutically well tolerated ciprofloxacin treatment adult complicate urinary tract infection . Two levofloxacin 125 mg tablet take orally daily ( two placebo tablet take daily , 12 hour later ) 10 day ; one ciprofloxacin 500 mg tablet one placebo tablet take orally twice daily 10 day .</detailed_description>
