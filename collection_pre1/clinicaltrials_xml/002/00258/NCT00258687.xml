	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn vaccine make patient 's tumor cell , genetically modify secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , delay stop growth tumor . It also look vaccine 's effect immune system side effect give vaccine make subject 's cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Trial Clear Cell Sarcoma , Pediatric Renal Cell Carcinoma , Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma Children With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient surgery remove portion tumor . This tumor bring special , certified laboratory break single cell wash . Specially trained laboratory technician use method know adenoviral mediate gene transfer , add new gene cancer call . This gene cause cell make GM-CSF , powerful hormone stimulate immune system . The cell give enough radiation never grow , enough completely destroy , develop vaccine . The patient injected vaccine day 0 , 7 , 14 , 28 , every two week supply vaccine run . The amount vaccine make depend upon total amount cell take tumor . The actual injection like childhood vaccination go skin muscle different place use injection . It hop cancer cell make secrete hormone GM-CSF cause patient 's immune system attack cancer part body . If tumor yield enough cell , patient also give injection non-transduced irradiated tumor cell . Non-transduced mean gene GM-CSF add cell vaccine . This do measure amount reaction immune system cause vaccine . This injection measure delay type hypersensitivity , DTH . The patient ask undergo optional skin biopsy vaccine DTH site see immune reaction occur injection sit 2 day vaccine 1 vaccine 5 . The following test procedure perform study : physical exam , blood sample , immune study , vital sign physical exam . At week 10 patient 's treatment , early doctor feel necessary , patient undergo chest , abdomen pelvic XT scan . A brain MRI perform abnormality first brain MRI new central nervous system symptom develop . If patient 's disease disappear new lesion find patient receives least six vaccine , may opportunity undergo second course study treatment . Patients may participate study one follow happens : All vaccine create tumor give patient ; patient 's disease worsen ; patient experience unacceptable and/or harmful side effect ; patient becomes pregnant ; patient unable follow study plan ; patient 's doctor feel longer best interest patient continue .</detailed_description>
