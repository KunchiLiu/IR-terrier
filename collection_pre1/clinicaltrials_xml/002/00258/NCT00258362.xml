	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give carboplatin docetaxel follow radiation therapy work treat patient stage III , stage IV , recurrent endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine time progression patient stage III IV recurrent endometrial cancer treat induction chemotherapy comprise carboplatin docetaxel follow radiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy comprise carboplatin docetaxel . Secondary - Determine toxic effect regimen patient . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel intravenous ( IV ) 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course . After hematologic recovery chemotherapy , patient receive radiotherapy 5 day week 7 week . Beginning 3-4 week later , patient receive another 3 course docetaxel carboplatin . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
