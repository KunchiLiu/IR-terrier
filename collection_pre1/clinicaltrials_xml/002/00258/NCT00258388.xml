	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel prednisone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . OGX-011 may help docetaxel prednisone kill tumor cell make tumor cell less resistant drug . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give docetaxel prednisone without OGX-011 work treat patient recurrent metastatic prostate cancer respond previous hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Prednisone With Without OGX-011 Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Previous Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy , term prostate-specific antigen response , docetaxel prednisone without OGX-011 patient hormone-refractory locally recurrent metastatic prostate cancer . Secondary - Determine objective response rate duration patient treat regimen . - Determine safety toxic effect regimens patient . - Determine overall progression-free survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize , open-label study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive load dose OGX-011 IV 2 hour day -7 , -5 , -3 . Patients receive OGX-011 IV 2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , oral prednisone twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 oral prednisone twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
