	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . OGX-011 may help docetaxel kill tumor cell make tumor cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give OGX-011 together docetaxel work treat woman locally advance metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OGX-011 Docetaxel Treating Women With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy OGX-011 docetaxel , term objective tumor response rate , woman locally advance metastatic breast cancer . Secondary - Determine tolerability toxicity regimen patient . - Determine time progression overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive OGX-011 IV 2 hour day -7 , -5 , -3 , 1 , 8 , 15 course 1 day 1 , 8 , 15 subsequent course . Patients also receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 8 course . Treatment repeat every 21 days* 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Course 1 28 day length subsequent course ( course 2-10 ) 21 day length . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week periodically disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 42 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
