	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving gefitinib surgery may shrink tumor remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well gefitinib work treat patient stage I , stage II , stage III esophageal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Stage I , Stage II , Stage III Esophageal Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety tolerability neoadjuvant gefitinib patient resectable stage I-III esophageal cancer . Secondary - Determine epidermal growth factor-receptor expression tissue sample obtain diagnosis surgery patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily begin day -21 -14 continue day -1 . Patients undergo tumor resection day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
