	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Levofloxacin Compared With Lomefloxacin Treatment Complicated Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levofloxacin antibacterial agent use treatment broad spectrum acute infection adult . This randomized , open-label study safety effectiveness levofloxacin compare lomefloxacin treatment adult complicate urinary tract infection . Patients one group treat 250 mg levofloxacin , take daily 7 10 day , group treat 400 mg lomefloxacin , also antibacterial agent , take daily 14 day . Patients follow 5 9 day completion treatment ( post-therapy ) ass clinical sign symptom infection . Long-term follow ( 4 6 week end treatment ) patient respond therapy provide evaluation clinical sign symptom . The primary assessment effectiveness include clinical response ( resolution sign symptoms post-therapy compare start study ) microbiological response ( eradication post-therapy infectious organism identify start study ) An additional assessment efficacy include overall clinical response , describe cure , improve , fail . Safety assessment include incidence adverse event throughout study , clinical laboratory test ( hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis ) physical examination start study post-therapy . The study hypothesis levofloxacin least effective therapeutically lomefloxacin treatment adult complicate urinary tract infection . Levofloxacin tablet , oral dose 250 mg take daily 7 10 day . Lomefloxacin tablet , oral dose 400 mg take daily 14 day .</detailed_description>
