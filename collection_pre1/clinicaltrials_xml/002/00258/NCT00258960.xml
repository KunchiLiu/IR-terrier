	<brief_summary>Eligible patient must receive Caelyx plus Cyclophosphamide plus Herceptin 6 cycle administer every 4 week . Sample size calculation do mean Simon 's method 2 stage phase II study base principal aim study ( evaluation rate objective response ) . The hypothesis bring efficiency treatment accept rate objective response least 55 % obtain , reject efficiency treatment rate response target low 35 % . In case , consider alpha error 0.05 80 % power , 14 patient include first stage ; study would continue 5 objective response find . The total number patient include study would 44 . The result significant find least 20 objective response . Assuming drop-out rate 10 % , total number patient need 49 patient .</brief_summary>
