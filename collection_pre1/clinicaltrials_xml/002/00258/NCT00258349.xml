	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together trastuzumab see well work treat patient metastatic breast canceror breast cancer recur chest wall . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some find tumor cell kill carry tumor-killing substance . Others interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Vorinostat trastuzumab also may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving vorinostat together trastuzumab may better way block tumor growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose vorinostat combination trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) patient metastatic local chest wall recurrent HER-2-amplified breast cancer . ( Phase I ) II . To determine toxic effect regimen patient . ( Phase I ) III . To determine response rate patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine time progression patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study vorinostat . PHASE I : Patients receive oral vorinostat twice daily day 1-14 trastuzumab ( HerceptinÂ® ) IV 90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos vorinostat maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . At least 6 patient treated MTD . PHASE II : Patients receive vorinostat MTD trastuzumab phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
