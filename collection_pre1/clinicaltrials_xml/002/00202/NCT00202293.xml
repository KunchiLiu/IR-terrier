	<brief_summary>Aim : In population first episode manic patient psychotic feature , want compare side effect profile , degree adherence subjective well , well efficacy two treatment : The standard treatment currently apply ( lithium + chlorpromazine ) alternative treatment recently introduce ( lithium + olanzapine ) . In addition , want study retrospectively development bipolar disorder study prospectively 6 12-month outcome cohort patient present first manic episode psychotic feature . Research Background : While efficacy lithium treatment acute mania establish numerous study , also know 50 % patient fail respond prescribe alone . It therefore common practice complement treatment , commonly antipsychotic benzodiazepine . It suggest antipsychotic agent faster act superior control hyperactivity compare lithium , whereas mood stabilisation well achieve lithium , Typical antipsychotic , chlorpromazine , may therefore useful adjunctive medication mood stabiliser , especially within first week treatment acute mania , patient exhibit psychotic symptom hyperactivity . They however induce side effect ( somnolence , dizziness , dry mouth , extrapyramidal side effect rigidity muscle , possibly tardive dyskinesia ( involuntary movement contraction muscle ) , well akathysia ( sense restlessness ) . They finally suspect contribute occurrence post-manic depression . Recent publication chronic population show atypical antipsychotic , olanzapine , also effective adjunctive treatment . Olanzapine important advantage induce low incidence extrapyramidal side effect , include tardive dyskinesia . It however induce somnolence , dizziness , dry mouth , rather commonly weight gain . Moreover , author report olanzapine might induce mania . Both treatment appear positive effect well undesirable side effect . Our project compare . The literature concern first episode mania sparse , particularly domain pharmacotherapy . One retrospective study show 77 % patient receive antipsychotic discharge 25 % 6 month follow-up . No comparison however make typical atypical antipsychotic , specific treatment guideline first episode mania psychotic feature . Project Summary : The hypothesis olanzapine chlorpromazine comparable efficacy adjunctive treatment acute manic episode psychotic feature . We however think olanzapine induce less side effect well accepted patient , therefore adherence treatment good chlorpromazine . We finally think subjective sense well great olanzapine chlorpromazine.We recruit 75 patient time first admission mania psychotic feature EPPIC . After signature inform consent , perform baseline assessment first confirm diagnosis , second evaluate level psychopathology . The patient randomly select receive either treatment lithium olanzapine treatment lithium chlorpromazine . By end study 37 patient group.The patient go baseline assessment include physical examination usual laboratory investigation exclude physical illness . They also go one-hour assessment psychopathology . Between day 2 3 go 2 hour interview reassess diagnosis personal history . They thereafter assess weekly eight week various dimension : evolution intensity symptom , appearance depressive symptom , occurrence side effect degree adherence treatment , 1-hour interview . Subjective well quality life evaluate week 4 8 , add 45 minute duration interview . This flexible dose , open trial , mean doctor charge patient know medication prescribe , allow adapt dosage accord feel necessary . This research project allow u organise specialise clinic care first episode manic patient . We take opportunity study carefully month precede appearance first episode order try reconstruct prodrome bipolar disorder . We also , extension phase study , look long term outcome ( 6 12 month ) first episode mania .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Combination Olanzapine+Lithium Chlorpromazine+Lithium Treatment First Manic Episode With Psychotic Features</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective single-centre open trial compare two group receive two different neuroleptic combine lithium first 8 week treatment first manic episode . All patient also include 6 12 month follow-up study provide information regard prodrome bipolar illness . The trial comprise five phase : ( 1 ) Recruitment screening ; ( 2 ) Baseline assessment ; ( 3 ) 8 week treatment phase ; ( 4 ) Follow-up . 1 . Recruitment screen The Youth Access Team ( YAT ) assess patient refer Early Psychosis Prevention Intervention Centre ( EPPIC ) order confirm diagnosis first psychotic episode . Patients clinical presentation compatible diagnosis first episode mania present main investigator one co-investigators screen interview . This interview take place soon possible , later 24 hour admission . During 24 hour , patient keep treatment benzodiazepine exclusively . Any patient meeting inclusion criterion ( include Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) [ 37 ] total score equal superior 20 ) none exclusion criterion screen interview inform ( well his/her family ) study , receive Patient Information Sheet . A Consent form complete agree take part study . Patients section 12 unable give inform consent : patient ask consent well . The authorised psychiatrist able give consent treatment behalf well . When well ask give consent give consent , information gather patient remove . If patient decline consent study , she/he offer standard clinical care EPPIC . 2 . Baseline assessment Once inform consent give , provide YMRS score 24 hour admission remain great 20 , patient assess research assistant blind treatment first 8 week study . ¨ The diagnosis base clinical assessment accord DSM-IV [ 38 ] criterion . It confirm first week study result Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV , Patient Version ( SCID-P ) [ 38 ] . ¨ The severity illness evaluate baseline YMRS , BPRS , Clinical Global Impression bipolar version ( CGI-BP ) [ 39 ] Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) [ 38 ] . ¨ The depressive symptom assess 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAMD-21 ) [ 40 ] . - Substance abuse comorbidity assess first week PACE Substance Use Questionnaire ( PSUQ ) - Level functioning assess Quality Life Scale ( QLS ) [ 41 ] , Premorbid Adjustment Scale ( PAS ) [ 42 ] Modified Vocational Status Index ( MVSI ) Modified Location Code Index ( MLCI ) [ 43 ] first week treatment . If necessary participation relative ask . In addition , subject undergo physical examination , include blood test , safety reason . Demographic data , vital sign , detail concomitant medication medical history also collect . ¨ Laboratory test : Haematology : Haemoglobin , MCH , MCHC , MCV , RBC , WCC , platelet , haematocrit . Biochemistry : Total bilirubin , total protein albumin , AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase , urea , creatinine , sodium , potassium , prolactin , cholesterol , triglyceride , glucose , thyroid function test ( freeT4 TSH ) , prolactine level . 3 . 8-week Treatment phase : The Australian Clinical Guidelines Early Psychosis [ 44 ] suggest first episode patient ideally observe 24 hour medication start . This rule also apply context study . During period , medication restrict benzodiazepine except case severe agitation . In case severe agitation neuroleptic prescribe , possible informed consent randomisation . Patients thereafter randomly assign one two group : olanzapine + lithium , chlorpromazine + lithium . The raters ( research assistant one psychiatrist charge rating side effect ) blind randomisation process treatment condition first 8 week trial . Each subject also allocate case manager psychiatrist one investigator . The psychiatrist charge patient blind treatment , therefore rating side effect . A research assistant conduct psychometric assessment across 12 month study remain blind medication receive first 8 week trial . During eight week period , patient see accord clinical need , meet weekly week 4 week 6 8 assessment current level psychopathology , collection safety data assessment compliance . After first 8 week treatment , psychiatrist free change treatment . Neurolpetics continue minimum 6 month lithium minimum 12 month . Lithium serum level assess day 4 7 , accordingly stability blood level . 4 . Follow-up prospective evaluation : In phase , aim compare level side effect medication regimen , subjective well-being adherence treatment first 8 week treatment . Other aims ass efficacy treatment , incidence depressive symptom , 6 12 month outcome . ¨ Side-effects assess weekly UKU rating scale . - Adherence medication assess weekly Medication Adherence Rating Scale ( MARS ) . - Subjective well-being assess Drug Attitude Inventory ( DAI ) Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptics Scale ( SWN ) week 1,4 8 . - The severity illness prospectively evaluate weekly basis week 4 , week 6 8 , month 6 month 12 YMRS , BPRS CGI-BP . - Depressive symptom assess time line HAMD-21 . - Substance abuse comorbidity reassess week 8 , month 6 month 12 PSUQ . - Change inn level function assessed QLS , PAS MVSI MLCI month 6 month 12 . - Vital sign weight change reassess week 4 8 month 6 12 , whenever necessary . - Laboratory value reassess week 8 , whenever necessary . SUBJECTS TRIAL SAMPLE The aim recruit 75 first episode manic patient two year period . EPPIC take care 60 80 first episode manic patient year plan recruitment rate 50 % . TREATMENT Trial drug Lithium : Lithium start 500mg per day day one increase 500 mg bd day 2 . Serum lithium assess day 4 , daily dose lithium adapt accordingly . Serum lithium assess day 7 thereafter twice week depend previous result . We aim keep lithium level 0.5 1.0 mEq/l , ideally 0.8 1.0 mEq/l . ( Higher level recommend lithium prescribe along antipsychotic [ 49 ] Chlorpromazine : Chlorpromazine start 100 mg/day orally adjust day 2 step 50 mg 100 mg , upwards downwards . Chlorpromazine continue minimum 6 month , interrupt accord clinical state . Olanzapine : Olanzapine start 5mg/day adjusted step 2.5mg day accord clinical picture , upwards downwards . Olanzapine continue minimum 6 month , interrupt accord clinical state . CONCOMITANT MEDICATION All medication ( prescribe over-the-counter medication ) ongoing start trial start trial , must document file . The following medication allow , specified circumstance : Diazepam : 50 mg/day alleviate severe agitation . Benztropine : 4 mg/day , treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptom . Paroxetin : prescribed case occurrence depressive episode persist optimisation lithium treatment interruption antipsychotic . ASSESSMENTS Safety ¨ The frequency treatment-emergent adverse event ( event first appear worsen study period ) compare group . ¨ The frequency side effect rat UKU scale compare group . ¨ Weight gain compare group . ¨ Frequency change vital sign laboratory finding compare group . Subjective well- ¨ Total score DAI SWN compare group . ASSESSMENT OF SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Adherence ¨ Degree adherence treatment score MARS compare group . Efficacy ¨ End point analysis : Mean change various scale baseline week 4 week 8 use compare efficacy two treatment : ¨ Primary efficacy analysis assess compare mean change theYMRS total score . ¨ Secondary efficacy analysis assess compare mean change CGI-BP total score BPRS total score . ¨ Response analysis : Response define least 50 % drop total YMRS total score base line 8-weeks end point . Euthymia define total score YMRS great 12 end point . The number patient reach level improvement group compare . Incidence depressive episode ¨ A worsen HAMD-21 score least 3 point use definition clinically detectable worsen depressive symptom . Six 12 month outcome Definition recovery : - Syndromic recovery : Eight contiguous week [ 50 ] patient long meet criteria manic , mixed , depressive syndrome . Recovery syndromes base DSM-IV criterion operationalised follow : manic syndrome-no longer meet A B criterion manic episode ; depressive syndrome-no longer meet A criterion major depressive episode ; mixed syndrome-no longer meet A B criterion manic episode A criterion major depressive episode . - Symptomatic recovery : Eight contiguous week [ 50 ] patient experience minimal psychiatric symptom , operationalized follow : Young Mania Rating Scale total score 5 less , Hamilton depression scale total score 10 le . - Relapse : Relapse define return symptom remission le 8 week . - Recurrence : Recurrence define return symptom recovery . - Functional recovery : Return premorbid level function least 8 contiguous week [ 50 ] . To assess functional recovery , seven nine general item Premorbid Adjustment Scale evaluate 6 12-month follow-up visit interval period ( exclude rating education abruptness change work associate index episode , since score change ) . To meet criterion functional recovery , subject receive Premorbid Adjustment Scale general item interval score less equal premorbid rating five seven item interval item score 2 point higher correspond premorbid score . Additionally , functional recovery consider realised patient return least base level MLCI MVSI .</detailed_description>
