	<detailed_description>In people mild COPD , ability exhale air lung partly limit narrow collapse airway . This result trap air within lung over-distention lung chest - know lung hyperinflation . We believe breathe high lung volume ( hyperinflation ) important cause breathe discomfort ( dyspnea ) people COPD . Bronchodilators help relax muscle airways breathe tube . Bronchodilators often prescribe cough occurs airway narrow ; medication reduce coughing , wheeze shortness breath . Bronchodilators take orally , injection inhalation begin act almost immediately effect last 4-6 hour . The main purpose study examine effect inhale bronchodilator breathe discomfort exercise endurance patient mild COPD . Each subject attend 4 visit laboratory . Visit 1 ( screen visit ) involve record medical history , medication use , anthropometrics measurement , questionnaire , breathe test , incremental cycle exercise test constant-workload cycle exercise test . Visit 2 involve breathing test constant-workload cycle exercise test . Visits 3 4 involve breathing test constant-workload cycle exercise test subject randomize either placebo Atrovent . These visit do separate day subject receive two treatment random order .</detailed_description>
