	<brief_summary>Human animal study show inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) decrease airway blood flow . This effect immediate ( within 30 minute ) , transient ( last 90 minute ) , animal study independent gene expression . In COPD patient , decrease bronchial blood flow may also decrease mucosal edema , airway resistance improve small airway function . If effect exist , able measure improvement airway conductance reduce lung hyperinflation , would salutary effect dyspnea exercise endurance . To knowledge , study examine immediate effect ICS small airway function COPD . The purpose study examine effect nebulized Pulmicort small airway function ( spirometry , plethysmographic lung volume , airway resistance , closing volume , partial flow-volume loop analysis ) exercise endurance patient moderate severe COPD . HYPOTHESIS 1 . Nebulized ICS immediately improve airway function compare placebo ( nebulized saline ) . 2 . Enhanced lung empty reduce operate lung volume rest exercise follow ICS therapy translate acutely clinically important reduction exertional dyspnea improvement exercise endurance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single site , pilot , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , cross-over study conduct centre . Subjects require complete four ( 4 ) visit laboratory one-month period . At Visit 1 , subject meet study inclusion exclusion criterion , full set pulmonary function test ( PFT ) do complete symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise test . At Visit 2 , subject partial set pulmonary function test ( PFT ) do complete symptom-limited constant load cycle exercise test . On third fourth visit subject randomize treatment either nebulized saline nebulized PulmicortÂ® double blind , cross-over design , subsequent PFT 's symptom limit constant load exercise test do .</detailed_description>
