Eligible subject complete baseline assessment 7-day run Depakote-ER prior randomization . After 7-day baseline period run Depakote-ER , subject randomize transition either 12 week Depakote-ER placebo , begin upon completion 7-day run-in baseline period . Valproic acid level obtain end baseline period use adjust dose Depakote-ER ( match placebo ) need target valproic level 70-120 ug/ml . Dose increase , need , occur study medication dispense next follow visit ( scheduled end 1st week active study medication placebo ) . Subjects valproic acid level &gt; 120 ug/ml end baseline period contact soon possible instructed decrease dose Depakote-ER ( match placebo ) accordingly . Subjects randomize placebo condition receive placebo match number appearance dosage Depakote-ER prescribed 7-day baseline period . If need , number placebo pill adjust match change Depakote-ER dosage determine necessary base valproic acid level obtain end 7-day baseline period . Duration Subject Participation : Subjects receive either divalproex sodium extend release ( Depakote-ER ) match placebo 12 week .
