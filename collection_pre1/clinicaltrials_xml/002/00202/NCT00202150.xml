	<brief_summary>Patients live advanced chronic disease ( ACD ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) present substantial care economic challenge health care system due frequent emergency room visit acute care hospitalization . Morbidity mortality high complex population , patient quality life often compromise . Care patient ACD occur across health care sector , provider acute , primary community setting . Despite recent effort enhance care patient ACD , multidisciplinary disease management program , variation gap exist along continuum care . The available evidence suggest opportunity optimize primary care patient ACD . We propose build upon current evidence guideline disease management program , exist specialized resource , exist primary care practice , develop test model care primary care base , sensitive unique demand characteristic different primary practice . Our goal design linkages care strategy relevance importance primary care provider care patient advance COPD CHF . This demonstration project randomize control clinical trial RoadMAP program ( intervention ) deliver Primary Care Nurse Specialist ( PCNS ) compare usual care ( control group ) .

Our goal design linkage care strategy relevance importance primary care provider care patient advance COPD CHF . The study randomize controlled clinical trial RoadMAP program ( intervention ) deliver PCNS compare usual care ( control group ) . The primary outcome degree adherence clinical practice guideline . Secondary outcome patient satisfaction , quality life , use community-based service , number emergency room visit , number hospitalization . The purpose RoadMAP program improve care people advance stage COPD CHF . Specifically , activity aim improve patient ' self care ability , facilitate access appropriate service , ensure medical treatment accord consensus guideline promote consistency health care communication . Adherence guideline process involve activity patient , PCNS , Primary Care Physician . The PCNS would follow-up patient approximately one month initial contact every 3 month , assess monitor adherence propose MAP patient , physician , nurse . Patients option return physician office monitor phone . An office visit recommend perceived need medical assessment intervention . The family physician would continue see patient require order carry medical portion MAP deal primary care problem need .
