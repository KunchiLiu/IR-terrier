	<brief_summary>Hypertension common problem Canada prevalence 15 % . The goal hypertension therapy maximize blood pressure control . Home blood pressure monitoring ( HBPM ) device available many patient use . The role self-monitoring blood pressure play optimize blood pressure control unclear . We hope clarify role home blood pressure monitoring treatment hypertension explore may affect patient physician behaviour relate blood pressure management . This study compare group hypertensive patient use HBPM use device . The intervention ( HBPM ) group measure blood pressure home minimum weekly report measurement family doctor visit .

	<detailed_description>The objective study measure effect home ( self ) blood pressure monitor control hypertension primary care set . This research important several reason : ) Lack control hypertension common associate morbidity mortality . ii ) The cost manage hypertension high , prevalence hypertension , also maintenance control must exist many year patient . iii ) Home blood pressure monitoring increasingly used patient . iv ) Guidelines home blood pressure monitor already develop distribute . v ) While would seem helpful increase self-care patient , currently conflict inadequate evidence home monitoring useful . The main hypothesis study , compare patient receive usual care , patient use home monitoring low blood pressure level . Our secondary hypothesis HBPM change physician patient behaviour way would result good control hypertension . The methodology use cluster randomization . Physicians randomly allocate either patient use intervention continue usual care . The intervention experimental group provision home blood pressure monitor patient request record weekly blood pressure measurement report family physician regular hypertension follow-up visit . The physician inform current guideline target level home monitor blood pressure . The control group receive usual care . The main outcome measure blood pressure level ( 24 hour ambulatory monitoring ) baseline , 6 month 12 month . The secondary objective study measure effect home monitoring physician ' patient ' behaviour related hypertension control . Behaviours measure include intensity type pharmacological treatment , compliance antihypertensive medication change patient 's lifestyle .</detailed_description>
