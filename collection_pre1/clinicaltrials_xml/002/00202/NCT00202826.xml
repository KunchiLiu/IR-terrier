	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine best treatment child fluid collection chest associate underlying pneumonia . Researchers generally agree child large fluid collection chest need fluid drain addition anitbiotics . There many treatment study child show effective safe , treatment never compare randomize control study . The optimal treatment pediatric parapneumonic effusion remain controversial . The objective study compare use conventional management ( antibiotic thoracostomy tube placement ) primary thorascopic drainage ( see protocol ) . Our hypothesis pediatric patient parapneumonic effusion , regardless pleural fluid composition loculations , decrease morbidity treat early thoroscopic adhesiolysis ( VATS ) compare conservative treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ultimate objective study rationalize treatment decision . It hope pilot study provide basis randomize prospective study . The expected benefit current treatment outcome pediatric parapneumonic effusion determine . Insights therapy result least morbidity , hospital day , ( therefore cost ) elucidate . If hypothesis valid , aggressive surgical approach treatment parapneumonic effusion may warrant . If hypothesis valid , appropriate treatment parapneumonic effusion , irrespective institution personal opinion , become apparent .</detailed_description>
