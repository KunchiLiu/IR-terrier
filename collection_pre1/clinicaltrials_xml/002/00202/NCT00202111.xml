	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare short long term outcomes people colon cancer remove either laparotomy ( large cut abdominal wall ) laparoscopic assist approach ( keyhole surgery ) . This study involve 37 credentialled surgeon 20 approve hospital across Australasia recruitment period ( Jan 1998 March 2005 ) 601 patient recruit ALCCaS Trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Laparoscopic Versus Open Operations Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIMS The primary aim study test hypothesis tumour related disease free interval overall survival equivalent regardless whether patient receive laparoscopic colon resection ( LCR ) open colon resection ( OCR ) three five year post operatively . The secondary aim study determine safety LCR compare OCR 30 day mortality compare post operative pain , paralytic ileus , early late morbidity ( include wound site recurrence ) , recovery , transfusion requirement , cost quality life score . BACKGROUND The ALCCaS Trial Australasian , multicentred , prospective , randomise clinical study compare laparoscopic conventional open surgical treatment colon cancer adult . This trial recruiting patient since 1998 . Patients randomise receive either laparoscopic conventional open resection colon cancer . A Randomisation Centre establish provide 24-hour randomisation service centre situate Christchurch , New Zealand . The Health Research Council New Zealand Data Safety Committee , chair Professor Tom Fleming , access ALCCaS Trial annually ensure meet strict ethical research relate criterion . During recruitment period ( Jan 1998 March 2005 ) 601 patient recruit ALCCaS Trial . There 37 surgeon involve recruit patient 20 hospital within Australia New Zealand . All surgeon participate ALCCaS trial accredit laparoscopic surgical technique . To gain accreditation , surgeon must carry less 20 supervise colon resection must provide video evidence two laparoscopic colonic resection review . Surgeons throughout Australia New Zealand participate study . The Research Ethics Committees variety hospital throughout New South Wales , Queensland , South Australia , Victoria , Western Australia New Zealand approve study . DATA COLLECTION The type colon resection perform individual surgeon follow standard oncologically safe principle . The following intra-operative detail collect , patient epidemiology , ASA status , previous abdominal surgery , incision type , site carcinoma , modality diagnosis , pre operative haemoglobin lung function test , pre operative blood transfusion , plan operation , plan incision . Intra operatively date operation , whether DVT prophylaxis use , type bowel preparation , type operation perform , laparoscopic procedure perform whether include mobilisation bowel , ligation main artery vein , transection bowel , resection bowel anastomosis do intraperitoneal procedure record . The use cytotoxic irrigation peritoneum , wound colonic lumen note . Estimated surgical blood loss intra operative blood transfusion record . The post operative position tumour note . The type incision size incision record . Any reason change plan incision record theatre utilisation , total anaesthetic time duration operative procedure record . Intra operative temperature record kept . Reason stoma formation , applicable , record . The intra operative cost disposable item identify . Intra operative complication identify well adverse event involve surgical equipment . In post operative phase total intravenous fluid requirement , blood transfusion , pain score , amount Morphine use , whether patient vomit whether nasogastric tube require well lung function test adverse event note 30 minute follow procedure , 6 hour , 24 hour , 48 hour , 72 hour , 96 hour , 120 hour , 144 hour , 168 hour continue daily patient discharge already discharged time . At discharge hospital , total hospital day identify well time high dependency unit intensive care unit , reason delay discharge note , post operative event include cardiac , respiratory , renal , ileus , wound infection , anastomotic leakage event identify . Pathology include site tumour , TNM staging , ACPS staging , length resect colon , proximal clearance , distal clearance , number node obtain , tumour differentiation , venous invasion , perineal invasion histological type . Adjuvant chemotherapy plan note . Patients study may enter adjuvant chemotherapy trial follow surgery provide subsequent trial radiation component therapy chemotherapy trial allow enter patient surgical arm study . Follow quarterly first year , 6 monthly year two three annually year five . At follow wound check evidence recurrence . A colonoscopy perform 12 month follow resection every three year follow negative . Chest xray , abdominal CT liver ultrasound , complete blood picture perform clinically indicate , CEA â€™ perform six monthly . FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE Patients follow tumour recurrence survival . Patients advise , offer standard treatment , adjuvant therapy . Follow-up standardise provide accurate data recurrence survival frequent examination investigation perform clinically indicate . Frequency Follow-up : The minimum number follow-up evaluation follow : - every 3 month lst year . - every 6 month 2nd 3rd year . - annually 4th 5th year . Test Schedule : The minimal requirement follow-up investigation follow : - History examination specific check tumour wound recurrence . - Colon evaluation include colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy plus barium enema . - Annual examination positive neoplasia ( earlier preoperative proximal examination incomplete technical reason ) ; examination every 3 year negative . - haemoglobin white cell count - creatinine , SGOT , alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin , CEA - Chest X-ray - Abdominal CT scan liver ultrasound annually 5 year . - Quality Life Complications documentation postoperatively 2 day , 2 week , 2 month 18 month . SIGNIFICANCE AND OUTCOMES The study determine efficacy safety laparoscopic assist resection colonic adenocarcinoma . It also answer question cost effectiveness quality life improvement . It determine port site recurrence real issue type surgery . The study also give valuable data outcome patient undergo laparotomy regard current length hospital stay , effectiveness post-operative analgesia , hospital complication transfusion requirement .</detailed_description>
