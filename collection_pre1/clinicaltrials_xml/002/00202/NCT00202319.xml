	<detailed_description>Sedation integral part treatment care critically ill , ventilate patient . Adequate sedation find reduce stress , promote relaxation , induce amnesia , improve tolerance ventilatory support , generally assist nursing care . However , sedative agent produce significant side effect loss consciousness , amnesia haemodynamic instability . In view complex characteristic associate sedative agent , important systematically assess evaluate effectiveness clinical area . Two issue important determine effective use agent . The first issue relate use specific sedation scale facilitate consistent interpretation among clinician . The use scale limit Australia . The second issue relate practice protocol-directed sedation . Despite support decision-making tool assist clinician choice sedative agent , study evaluate effectiveness . This research aim compare effectiveness protocol-directed sedation management traditional non protocol-directed practice Australian intensive care unit ( ICU ) . In many Australian ICUs , bedside nurse titrates mechanical ventilation sedation administration consultation medical staff , usually unstructured manner . This project build upon significant North American study find substantial decrease duration mechanical ventilation , length stay rate tracheostomy insertion follow implementation structure sedation protocol nurse . However exact replication protocol possible due lack drug availability Australia prefer drug regime RMH intensive care consultant . In addition , study document patient ’ memory experience ventilate whilst sedate , despite document discomfort anxiety , panic difficulty synchronize ventilator . There similar lack literature staff perception implementation multidisciplinary sedation protocol . The research question study design examine three area : 1. difference patient receive protocol-directed sedation management compare non protocol-directed sedation management ; 2. difference patient perception mechanical ventilation protocol-directed sedation management compare non protocol-directed sedation management follow extubation , ; 3. staff perception use sedation protocol manage critically ill mechanically ventilated patient . The design prospective , randomise , control trial study 316 patient . There 158 patient recruit control group 158 patient experimental group . The control group receive current management experimental group receive protocol-directed sedation management . To explore patient perception experience , patient interview use semi-structured questionnaire follow extubation receive rating 4 sedation scale 24 hour . In addition , staff perception survey attitude perception protocol . This study determine efficacy outcomes protocol-directed sedation management critically ill mechanically ventilated patient Australian context . The study also improve understand patient ’ memory perception period , could lead improved clinical practice well patient outcome . In understanding staff perception sedation protocol implementation , assist u identify change improve education new staff compliance issue ongoing implementation . It may useful future development decision-making tool subsequent implementation evaluation phase .</detailed_description>
