	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - evaluate efficacy tolerability drug prazosin compare placebo combat stress-related nightmare , sleep disturbance overall function recently combat-exposed returnees Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) . - evaluate effect selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) paroxetine behavioral symptom overall function population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prazosin v Paroxetine Combat Stress-Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) Nightmares &amp; Sleep Disturbance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trauma-related nightmare sleep disruption follow combat exposure distress frequently treatment resistant symptom impair quality life overall function . These symptom closely resemble core nighttime symptom posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , increasingly recognize returnees Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) . Prazosin , generically available brain active alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist , markedly reduce eliminate combat trauma-related nightmare sleep disruption 23 25 combat-exposed returnees OIF Madigan Army Medical Center ( MAMC ) . The use prazosin OIF returnees base clinical efficacy prazosin trauma-related nightmare , sleep disturbance , overall function Vietnam combat veteran chronic PTSD . The drug FDA approve PTSD selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) sertraline paroxetine . However , SSRI effectiveness combat trauma PTSD , especially nighttime symptom , remain questionable . This placebo-controlled clinical trial prazosin vs. SSRI paroxetine combat trauma-related nightmare , sleep disturbance , overall posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) clinical severity OIF/OEF returnees . Both neurobiologic consideration preliminary clinical treatment data provide support propose trial . Preclinical clinical study suggest role increased central nervous system ( CNS ) adrenergic outflow and/or responsiveness PTSD pathophysiology . Possible mechanisms include alpha-1 adrenergic receptor-mediated effect sleep physiology , corticotropin release hormone secretion , disruption cognitive processing . Here propose double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel group 12 week clinical trial prazosin vs. paroxetine test follow hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 . Prazosin effective paroxetine placebo reduce frequency intensity combat trauma-related nightmare ( measure `` distressing dream '' item Clinician Administered PTSD Scale [ CAPS ] ) . Hypothesis 2 . Prazosin effective paroxetine placebo improve sleep quality ( measure Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [ PSQI ] ) . Hypothesis 3 . Prazosin effective paroxetine placebo improve overall clinical status ( measure Clinical Global Impression Change [ CGIC ] ) . Hypothesis 4 . Prazosin well tolerate paroxetine measure day retain study frequency adverse event . Primary outcome measure ass trauma-related nightmare , sleep disturbance change global clinical status : include CAPS [ 59 ] Recurrent Distressing Dreams item , PSQI ( 60 ) CGIC ( 58 ) score . Secondary outcome measure include total CAPS score , CAPS subscale score ( Reexperiencing/ Intrusions , Avoidance/Numbing , Hyperarousal ) , Nightmare Frequency Questionnaire ( NFQ ) , Insomnia Severity Index , measure depressive sign symptom , quality life , number study day complete .</detailed_description>
