	<brief_title>Lactate Metabolism Study HIV Infected Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management chronic HIV infection increasingly dependent upon management long term toxicity therapy . Toxicities often metabolic include hyperlipidemia , hyperglycemia , osteopenia lipodystrophy . While rare , lactic acidosis may present also , associate mortality . The consequence chronic hyperlactatemia well understood , know cause likely related mitochondrial toxicity nucleoside analogue , cornerstone class HIV therapy . No treatment syndrome chronic lactic acidosis proven , evidence exists suggest utilization cofactor thiamine , riboflavin L-carnitine management acute syndrome ; factor may alleviate mitochondrial compromise . The mechanism underlie lactic acidemia may result increase production ( result mitochondrial dysfunction ) , poor clearance lactate liver primary organ clearance . Some liver dysfunction could also attributable mitochondrial toxicity . In study propose study lactate metabolism among person chronic HIV infection ( treatment treatment naive ) compare result uninfected control population . We also study subset HIV infected person know underlying liver disease . Two methodology use : lactate challenge test forearm ischemia test . The effect supplementation cofactor may positive effect lactate metabolism facilitate mitochondrial function study well . All person enrol evaluation test repeat 4-6 week supplementation standardize dose cofactor thiamine L-carnitine test . Fat tissue sample PBMC 's collect analyzed quantity function , participant liver ultrasound . Liver biopsy complete subject clinically indicate . The result study provide important insight effect lactate metabolism , nucleoside analogue , HIV . Our primary hypothesis person D4T/ddI/ddC/AZT contain highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) demonstrate increase lactate production compare HIV negative control ; lactate metabolism normalize treatment cofactor ( riboflavin , thiamine , L-carnitine ) ; person liver disease therapy demonstrate prolong lactate clearance ; person change non-D4T/ddI/ddC/AZT containing regime demonstrate decrease lactate production baseline .</detailed_description>
