	<brief_summary>People high spinal lesion risk respiratory complication partial complete paralysis breathing muscle . Previous work show tetraplegic lung volume increase use abdominal FES expiration . The technique attractive non-invasive , painless tetraplegia completely reversible . It may provide treatment augment patient ’ breathe acute presentation spinal injury ( half cervical injury require ventilation ) long term management tetraplegia high paraplegia . We propose pilot study small group subject see technique feasible clinical engineering viewpoint . The aim study : 1 ) To examine effect abdominal FES lung mechanic gas exchange tetraplegic subject . 2 ) To optimise stimulation pattern intensity via electronic stimulators design trigger allow FES follow subject ’ breathing cycle automatically .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients high spinal cord injury ( SCI ) usually paralyse intercostal muscle rely diaphragm function alone respiration . They low tidal volume inadequate cough . These patient vulnerable respiratory complication immediate post-injury phase remain life-long risk chest problem . Usual treatment include intensive physiotherapy intermittent positive pressure ventilation augment patient ’ tidal volume help clear excess secretion . Tidal volumes also increased electrical stimulation surface abdominal muscle expiration . During stimulation patient expire functional residual capacity ( amount air leave normal expiration ) . The natural elasticity chest wall cause recoil increase size next inspired breath . Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) abdominal muscle theoretically attractive technique augment respiration . It non-invasive , mimic natural physiological process tetraplegic patient sense abdominal discomfort . There potential application acute SCI patient prevent need artificial ventilation aid ventilator wean . The technique could also use chronically injured patient augment ventilation . Clinical staff Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries Unit collaborate extensively engineering bioengineering team Glasgow University University Strathclyde use FES SCI . FES already use successfully Unit paraplegic cycling upper limb exercise tetraplegia . We perform abdominal FES one SCI subject complete diaphragm paralysis produce tidal volume one hundred millilitre ( McLean Hunt , unpublished observation ) . Before start large scale project important confirm whether reliably reproduce least finding Stanic et al . It would interest could show change gas exchange well simply increase tidal volume . Engineering issue include optimisation program FES stimulus . We propose pilot study QENSIU establish whether technique practical benefit spinal cord injure patient .</detailed_description>
