	<brief_summary>This 10-week , randomise , double blind , placebo-controlled , crossover trial investigate effect Cannabis Based Medicine Extract ( Sativex ) pattern brain activation associate movement 20 MS patient suffer low limb spasticity . Spasticity common symptom Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) , occur course disease , particularly progressive phase.Physiologically , spasticity hyperreflexia habitually see patient pyramidal syndrome due lesion descend pathway , cortico reticulospinal pathway , participate voluntary movements.It know endocannabinoid system act human least two type cannabinoids receptor , CB1 CB2 . There evidence support view psychoactive ingredient cannabis , delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( delta 9-THC ) , cannabinoids general , reduce muscle spasticity people MS . Aim study evaluate effect Sativex : ( ) pattern brain activation associate movement ( fMRI ) MS patient suffer spasticity ; ( ii ) change level spasticity ( H-reflex ) ; ( iii ) change intracortical excitability synaptic intracortical network motor area ( double shock TMS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Baseline assessment follow randomisation dose introduction . Patients randomly assign two counterbalanced group start either Sativex placebo first drug . They dispense sufficient study medication two week together diary . During two-week treatment period patient reach optimal , individualised dosage subjectively relief spasticity.Patient return three week undergo fMRI neurophysiological evaluations.Then patient perform two-week washout period request intake alternative medicine . After two week patient perform second fMRI/neurophysiological study . Two week later , second washout period , last visit perform conclude study .</detailed_description>
