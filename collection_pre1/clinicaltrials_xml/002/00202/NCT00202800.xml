	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer devastate disease . Previous research show correlation specific oncogene change ( ras-mutation ) enhance sensitivity two chemotherapy drug combine : gemcitabine etoposide . This Phase II trial evaluate drug combination locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Evaluate Gemcitabine Etoposide Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II single-armed study evaluate potential benefit gemcitabine etoposide combination treatment patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer . The study involve approximately 30-40 adult patient pancreatic cancer . Response rate , duration response , overall survival , quality life toxicity associate combination therapy evaluate . Primary Objective To evaluate response rate patient histologically cytologically confirm pancreatic cancer , previously untreated chemotherapy exception 5FU give part adjuvant regimen , receive gemcitabine-etoposide combination therapy . Secondary Objectives 1 . To evaluate duration response define study population . 2 . To evaluate overall survival . 3 . To evaluate quality life associate treatment combination.4.To describe toxicity profile . 5.To collect clinical specimen define study population evaluation potential molecular correlate diagnosis , disease progression , treatment outcome , survival , and/or treatment-associated toxicity proteomics microarray technology .</detailed_description>
