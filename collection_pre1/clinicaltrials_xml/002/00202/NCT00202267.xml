	<brief_title>Community RCT Effectiveness Two Compression Bandaging Technologies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Although rarely recognize pressing health care problem , leg ulcer comprise common , complex , costly condition . Over 80 % ongoing management chronic wound occur community , leg ulcer one frequently see chronic wound . The cost leg ulcer care considerable , report UK France account 2 % total national health budget . In Canada , impact recognize due pressure home care caseloads result hospital downsizing , nursing shortage , grow number complex health population . In one Ontario study , care few 200 community leg ulcer case cost excess $ 1.5 million supply nurse visit , translate $ 100 million yearly Canada-wide . The impact individual significant -- chronic , painful , often take year heal . Two-thirds individual leg ulcer least one recurrence , 45 % history condition date back 10 year . State Knowledge &amp; Clinical Practice Guidelines : Over past decade , evidence RCT study recent Cochrane systematic review BMJ demonstrate venous leg ulcer treat compression therapy likely heal . Multi-layer high compression system effective low compression . However , small number people trials compare different high compression system meant review unable draw conclusion relative merit . Four trial compare 4-layer bandage short stretch technology -- commonly use technology Canada . In total , trial involve 220 patient , thus underpowered . Furthermore , consider factor client preference ease use , incorporate economic evaluation . Plan Investigation : The study multi-centre , pragmatic , randomised trial two type compression bandaging technology , incorporate economic evaluation . Research objective : To compare effectiveness 2 high compression technology deliver community ulcer healing , recurrence rate , quality life , cost-effectiveness . Interventions : Four-layer bandage vs. Short-stretch bandage . Sample size : 414 total , 207 arm ( 80 % power , `` 0.05 detect 4 week difference time heal ) . Inclusion Criteria : leg ulcer &gt; 1 cm one dimension , minimum duration 1 week , ABPI &gt; 0.7 . Randomization : carry stratified : Clinical Centre ( 3 Health Regions Ontario ) ; Margolis ' Prognostic Model ( ulcer area duration ) , Ulcer episode ( 1st recurrent ulcer ) . Analysis : Primary outcome : time-to-healing reference ulcer . Secondary outcome : quality life &amp; expenditures treatment . Durability heal assessedâ€”follow-up 52 week post-healing determine recurrence rate associate technology . Summary : There consensus internationally recommend application graduate multi-layer compression . High compression effective low compression ; however , clear evidence high compression technology effective .</detailed_description>
