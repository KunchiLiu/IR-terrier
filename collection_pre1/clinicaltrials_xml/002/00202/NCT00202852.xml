Patients must stable dose folic acid prophylaxis least 4 week prior screen . Patients use oral corticosteroid , must stable dose &lt; =10 mg/day least 4 week prior screen . If currently use corticosteroid patient must receive corticosteroid least 4 week prior screen . If use NSAIDs , patient stable dose least 4 week prior screen . If currently use NSAIDs patient must least 4 week prior screen . The screening laboratory test must meet following criterion : Hemoglobin &gt; =5.3 mmol/L ( &gt; =8.5 g/dL ) , provide low hemoglobin level due nutritional deficiency due disease chronic RA WBC &gt; =3.5 x 10^9/L Neutrophils &gt; =1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets &gt; =100 x 10^9/L Serum transaminase &lt; =2 time upper limit normal Alkaline phosphatase level &lt; =2 time upper limit normal Serum creatinine &lt; =150 Âµmol/L ( &lt; =1.7 mg/dL ) Patient must able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . Patient must capable give informed consent consent must obtain prior study procedure include washout period . Pregnant woman , nurse mother plan pregnancy within 1.5 year enrollment . Patients incapacitated , largely wholly bedridden confine wheelchair , little ability selfcare . Patients current systemic inflammatory condition sign symptom might confound evaluation benefit Infliximab therapy , eg Lyme disease , rheumatic disease RA . Use DMARDs MTX within 4 week prior screen . ( If patient prior exposure leflunomide within past 6 month , cholestyramine 8 g give 3 time daily 11 day rapidly low plasma level leflunomide . ) Use intraarticular , i.m . i.v . corticosteroid ( include i.m . ACTH ) within 4 week prior screen . Have previously treat infliximab genetic recombinant therapy RA ( e.g . etanercept , adalimumab ) .

Also exclude patient evidence latent TB ( positive PPD skin test history latent TB ) without adequate therapy TB initiate prior first infusion study drug . Also exclude patient evidence old latent TB infection without documented adequate therapy , treat antitubercular therapy trial . Patients current close contact individual active TB also exclude . Additionally , patient complete treatment active TB within previous 2 year explicitly exclude trial . Patients household member history active pulmonary TB thorough evaluation TB prior study enrollment recommend local infectious disease specialist publish local guideline TB control agency .
