	<brief_title>Effectiveness Safety Ezetimibe Added Atorvastatin Patients With High Cholesterol Coronary Heart Disease ( Study P03740 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , parallel group , placebo-study design subject primary hypercholesterolemia [ plasma LDL-C concentration &gt; = 2.6 mmol/L ( 100 mg/dL ) &lt; = 4.1 mmol/L ( 160 mg/dL ) triglyceride concentration &lt; 3.99 mmol/L ( 350 mg/dL ) coronary heart disease currently treat atorvastatin 10 mg would benefit additional reduction LDL-C . This study ass whether daily co-administration ezetimibe 10 mg ongoing treatment atorvastatin 10 mg effective treatment atorvastatin 10 mg alone reduce LDL-C concentration achieve LDL-C target goal define ESC National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) guideline time database lock . The primary objective compare efficacy ezetimibe 10 mg add daily ongoing treatment atorvastatin 10 mg versus ezetimibe placebo add daily ongoing treatment atorvastatin 10 mg reduce concentration LDL-C endpoint 6 week treatment . The secondary objective compare efficacy ezetimibe 10 mg add ongoing treatment atorvastatin 10 mg daily versus ezetimibe placebo add ongoing treatment atorvastatin 10 mg daily 6 week treatment respect : - The percentage subject achieve target LDL-C goal define ESC NCEP guideline time database lock . - Change concentration total cholesterol , HDL-C triglyceride . - Safety tolerability . Approximately 200 subject enrol study insure least 160 subject complete study . Each site enroll approximately 20 subject total approximately 200 subject . The duration study subject approximately 7 week . Each subject schedule 3-4 study visit . Visits 1 2 screen visit ; visit may combine . At Visit 3 , subject meet enrollment criterion randomize one two treatment group : ezetimibe 10 mg ezetimibe placebo take ongoing open-label atorvastatin 10 mg/day . Randomization stratify base LDL-C level Visit 3 : &lt; 3.3 mmol/L ( 130 mg/dL ) &gt; = 3.3 mmol/L ( 130 mg/dL ) . Subjects treat 6 week return final visit , Visit 4 .</detailed_description>
