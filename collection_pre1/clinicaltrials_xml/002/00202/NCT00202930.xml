	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate feasibility give four weekly dos Rituximab ( anti-CD20 antibody ) treatment child refractory neuroblastoma associate opsoclonus-myoclonus . Patients must continue symptom opsoclonus , myoclonus ataxia despite surgical resection minimum one month steroid therapy . Evaluations include clinical symptom opsoclonus-myoclonus ataxia well detailed evaluation learning development .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Opsoclonus-myoclonus ataxia syndrome ( OMS ) rare immune mediate paraneoplastic syndrome occur approximately 2 3 % child neuroblastoma . Children neuroblastoma associate opsoclonus-myoclonus tend favorable prognosis standpoint cure cancer . Unfortunately , approximately two-thirds subgroup patient leave long term sequellae syndrome , include residual symptom opsoclonus , myoclonus , ataxia , learn difficulty disturbance sleep mood . Multiple line evidence indicate immune mechanism rare disorder . This include occurence OMS post-infectious state , aggressive lymphocytic infiltration tumor child OMS , document response therapries act suppression immune system . The current study utilizes four weekly dos anti-CD 20 antibody ( rituximab ) treat child refractory OMS . Refractory disease define continue symptom OMS despite surgical resection tumor minimum one month steroid therapy . All patient baseline OMS evaluation detail neurocognitive test study repeat completion four weekly infusion . OMS test repeat Month 3 . OMS test detailed neurocognitive testing conduct 6 month interval 2 year initial infusion . The goal study utilize novel therapy improve long term neurologic neurodevelopmental outcome child refratory neuroblastoma associate opsoclonus-myoclonus .</detailed_description>
