	<brief_summary>Primary generalize dystonia , also call idiopathic torsion dystonia dystonia musculorum deformans disable neurological condition usually start childhood , mostly low limb spread body part disease progress . Medical treatment usually ineffective patient become wheelchair bound even bedridden . Recently several case series one RCT report favourable result bilateral deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) primary generalize dystonias . However , number patient treat bilateral GPi stimulation still limit . Therefore , propose RCT investigate whether bilateral DBS GPi effective safe treatment patient primary generalized dystonia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design method : This randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicentre study compare effect bilateral DBS GPi placebo patient invalidate primary generalize dystonia . After inclusion study ( see in/exclusioncriteria ) , preoperative formal baseline assessment perform . Within six week inclusion patient undergo stereotactic implantation stimulation equipment GPi . Immediately surgery patient randomly allocate direct stimulation ( treatment group ) delay stimulation ( control group ) , stimulator se switch 0 Volt discharge hospital independent neurologist neurosurgeon . The patient group able control whether stimulation active ( &gt; 0 Volt ) . In way patient assessor blind . In centre postoperative care patient take place accord stratify stimulation parameter protocol assure comparable information group . Six month postoperatively , first formal outcome assessment perform blind assessor . After completion assessment stimulators control group activate independent neurologist neurosurgeon . From moment , 24 patient active DBS . However , patient blind assessor remain unaware result randomisation . All patient follow another six month second outcome assessment make assessor . Four Dutch centre experience DBS agree participate study . It estimate centre include least 4 patient . Because centra geographically spread country patient operate controlled nearby .</detailed_description>
