Objective : Phase I - To establish maximally tolerate dose ZD6474 obtain preliminary information regard spectrum toxicity ZD6474 , obtain pharmacokinetic data patient take EIAED . Phase I - To obtain preliminary information regard potential anti-tumor activity ZD6474 patient take EIAED . Phase II - To establish data regard anti-tumor activity ZD6474 collect information regard spectrum toxicity patient take EIAEDs . Eligibility : Patients histologically prove malignant primary glioma eligible protocol .
