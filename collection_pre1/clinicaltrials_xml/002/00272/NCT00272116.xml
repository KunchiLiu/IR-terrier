	<brief_summary>Zinc deficiency common develop country child , food intake often low , food animal source infrequently use , bioavailability zinc staple cereal-based diet limit zinc loss occur recur diarrheal illness . Zinc deficiency associate impairment immunological defense infection increase rate serious infection . Due limitation currently use biochemical marker , supplementation trial population likely deficient provide reliable mean assess health consequence zinc deficiency . A significantly low incidence prevalence diarrhea observe zinc supplement develop country child several placebo-controlled trial . The effect routine zinc supplementation lower respiratory tract infection still unclear . We , therefore , evaluate impact daily zinc supplementation representative sample child age 6 30 month enrol New Delhi slum area , sample size sufficient determine impact incidence severe diarrhea acute low respiratory infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Zinc Vitamin A Supplementation Diarrhea , Physical Growth Immune Response Malnourished Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diarrheal disease major cause child mortality develop country . Currently , management diarrhea focus oral rehydration therapy acute diarrhea . However , acute diarrhea account 1/3 diarrhea-related death , majority remain caused persistent diarrhea . Currently persistent diarrhea treatment complex , yet adapt community setting , hence , marginal impact diarrheal mortality . A major challenge develop implement cost-effective community-based intervention apply child diarrhea prevent persistence . The trial implement urban slum Dakshinpuri comprise 15,000 dwelling population 75,000 . Recent data neighbor community indicate childhood malnutrition , zinc deficiency , diarrhea low respiratory tract infection common . Children age 6 30 month identify door-to-door survey . Enrollment require parent give informed consent family intend emigrate . Eligible child individually randomize simple randomization scheme block 8 generate person Statens Serum Institut , Denmark . The zinc placebo syrup prepare package unbreakable bottle GK Pharma Aps ( Koge , Denmark ( label unique child number accord randomization scheme . The zinc placebo syrups similar appearance , taste packaging . The enrolled child randomize receive zinc gluconate ( 10 mg elemental zinc/day infant 20 mg/day old child ) placebo daily period 4 month . All included subject give massive dose vitamin A enrollment addition zinc placebo . A field attendant administer syrup daily home 4 month except Sundays , mother ask administer . One bottle contain 250 mL keep child 's home replace monthly . Field worker visit household every seventh day 4-month follow-up period . At visit , information obtain previous 7 day history fever , number consistency stool . If child diarrhea vomiting , dehydration assess . Information also obtain cough , low chest indrawing illness characteristic whether treatment seek previous 7 day . Intervention impact assess physician-diagnosed acute lower respiratory tract infection pneumonia . Blood collect baseline child measure micronutrient status . Cognitive development measure baseline end study use Bayelys Scales Infant Development version II .</detailed_description>
