	<brief_summary>This study document clinical genetic feature glaucoma related disease , include normal tension glaucoma ( NTG ) . Researchers would like define genetic influence eventually isolate gene cause disease . Glaucoma important cause vision loss United States worldwide . The disease mark wear retina optic nerve , often associate increased pressure eye . It often inherit trait . This study involve 250 2,000 patient 5-year period . It examine natural history genotype , genetic makeup , person phenotype , , visible situation produce interaction genotype one 's environment . Patients 4 old glaucoma relate disease whose family member disease may eligible study . They complete medical history doctor verify diagnosis , inquire medical problem surgical operation , gather data vision problem patient 's family ( draw family tree ) . The complete eye examination may take several hour . Eye drop use dilate , enlarge , pupils patient ' eye , pupil stay dilate 4 6 hour . There may temporary glare brightly light area , reduce wearing sunglass . Patients may experience blur vision . There may localize allergic reaction medication use increase pressure inside eye . If occurs , medication control reaction give . In addition , photographs retina perhaps even lens take . For procedure , eye drop dilate pupil eye . The light involved specialize photography may cause mild discomfort . Patients undergo eye test regard color vision , field vision , ability see dark . Also , measurement pressure eye thickness cornea . To study patient ' DNA , researcher obtain blood sample 4 teaspoon patient 10 year old . A small amount 1 teaspoon 5 lb . body weight collected young patient . Those DNA sample use research genetic disorder patient 's family . No test research conduct blood sample without patient ' separate permission . Also , DNA store code researcher define contain secured building . In study , researcher provide information patient 's health patient family member people . They discuss information adoption biological fatherhood unless medical implication patient patient 's family member . If information obtain study may important patient ' health , inform available . There plan give patient result medical test , evaluation , research data . Further research may need result become meaningful .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This project , Clinical Molecular Studies Families Glaucoma Related Diseases , study inheritance glaucoma family many nationality ethnic background order identify gene , mutate , cause glaucoma , elevate intraocular pressure , similar disease pathophysiology act . Study Population : The number subject enrol logical upper limit , least 250 2000 next 5 year . Design : The study consist ascertain individual especially family multiple individual , affect glaucoma related retinal anterior chamber disease . These patient family undergo detailed ophthalmological examination , indicate , additional non-investigational examination characterize disease family determine affectation status . A blood sample collect individual isolation DNA individual biochemical test lymphoblastoid transformation establish renewable source DNA . Linkage analysis , physical mapping , SNP microsatellite analysis association study , mutational screening carry identify specific gene mutation associate glaucoma family . If necessary , gene product blood sample characterize biochemically . The study enroll subject NEI collaborate institution . Outcome Measures : Linkage determine use lod score method mutation specific gene assess use combination residue conservation , blosum score , molecular modeling . Biochemical , metabolic , physiological effect individualize specific assay .</detailed_description>
