	<brief_summary>This study examine inheritance myopia family various nationality ethnic background identify gene change cause myopia similar disease well understand condition . In patient myopia , eye focus light accurately retina ( tissue line back eye ) , object distance appear blurry . Myopia may occur alone , vision problem retinal dislocation , cataract glaucoma , problem joint skin problem . People myopia ( usually family several affected member ) control subject normal vision may eligible study . Each participant undergo follow procedure : - Blood draw genetic testing relate disorder study - Medical family history , include draw family tree explore vision problem family - Complete eye examination , include refraction ( pupil dilation ) visual acuity testing , photographs retina possibly lens , specialized test measure field vision , color vision ability see dark</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This project , Clinical Molecular Studies Families Myopia Related Diseases study inheritance myopia family many nationality ethnic background order identify gene , mutate , cause myopia , high myopia , similar disease pathophysiology act . Study Population : The number subject enrol logical upper limit , least 250 2000 next 5 year . The study consist ascertain individual especially family multiple individual , affect myopia relate ocular disease . Design : These patient family undergo detailed ophthalmological examination , indicate , additional non-investigational examination characterize disease family determine affectation status . A blood sample collect individual isolation DNA individual biochemical study lymphoblastoid transformation establish renewable source DNA . Linkage analysis , physical mapping , mutational screening carry identify specific gene mutation associate myopia family . If necessary , gene product blood sample characterize biochemically . The study enroll subject NEI collaborate center include Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou , China . Outcome Measures : Linkage determine use lod score method mutation specific gene assess use combination residue conservation , blosum score , molecular modeling . Biochemical , metabolic , physiological effect individualize specific assay .</detailed_description>
