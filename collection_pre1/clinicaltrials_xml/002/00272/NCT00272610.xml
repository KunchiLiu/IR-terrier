	<brief_title>Topical Vitamin A Versus Vehicle Cream Treatment Aged Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human skin become thin loos elasticity increase age . These feature intrinsic skin age due reduction collagen synthesis concomitant increase collagen elastic fiber breakdown matrix metalloproteinase ( MMPs ) . In addition change occur simply passage time , skin chronically expose sun undergoes accelerate age process refer photoaging . Here sun cause alteration dermal matrix transiently induce MMPs irradiation . Bateman 's purpura ( BP ) bruise lesion commonly see sun-exposed extensor surface forearm hand elderly individual . It medical significance . However , afflict , BP often great source distress unsightliness obvious sign age represent . The pathophysiology BP rigorously study . Its exclusive presence sun-exposed surface frequently traumatize area suggest photoaging associate loss support structure around cutaneous blood vessel render vessel easily tear shear injury , thus cause purpura . Topical use tretinoin ( RA ) 0.1 % cream demonstrate improve clinical well histologic change associate photodamaged skin . Improvement skin wrinkle RA appear relate dermal change . RA cause accumulation epidermal dermal TGF-alpha 1 , cytokine know stimulate synthesis collagen I VII , , ultrastructural criterion , increase RA photodamaged skin . In fact , induction dermal collagen formation topically apply RA demonstrate animal study , confirm human study . Therefore , postulate topical treatment BP prone skin RA would buttress cutaneous blood vessel increase support collagenous structure around . Such vessel ought withstand shear force well , would lead protection development BP . Retinol precursor RA . When applied human skin , mediate effect RA cause , much less skin irritation . Therefore , expect well tolerate elderly skin RA . In seven day treatment study elderly patient , retinol show induce mRNA level procollagen molecule human skin vivo . Therefore , hypothesize improve thin skin elderly increase synthesis collagen photoaged , hence improve BP , intrinsically age human skin without cause significant irritant skin reaction .</detailed_description>
