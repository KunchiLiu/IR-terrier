	<brief_title>Study Testing Biologic Activity Safety Immunotherapeutic Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage IV Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , new Immunotherapeutic production process use show evidence potentially much high biologic activity pre-clinical study production process use previous study ( clinical protocol MB-002-003 ) . While process base individual subject autologous tumor RNA autologous monocyte derive DCs , maturation DCs newly modify process involves alter regimen culture cytokine . In addition , huCD40L mRNA add autologous expand tumor total mRNA electroporation . These change promise much improve migration , activity profile DC-Immunotherapeutic product RCC subject .</detailed_description>
