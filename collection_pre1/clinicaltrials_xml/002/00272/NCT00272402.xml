	<brief_summary>In randomize trial evaluate two conceptually distinct potentially synergistic intervention design reduce clinical inertia outpatient care adult type 2 diabetes . The project address follow specific aim ; Specific Aim 1 . Implement ass two conceptually distinct potentially synergistic intervention reduce clinical inertia relate control A1c , SBP , LDL adult diabetes . - Hypothesis 1 . Patients physician receive Cognitive Behavioral Intervention ( CBI ) ( Group 1 ) subsequently less Clinical Inertia receive intervention ( Group 4 ) . - Hypothesis 2 . Patients physician receive Office Systems Redesign intervention ( CBI ) ( Group 2 ) subsequently less Clinical Inertia receive intervention ( Group 4 ) . - Hypothesis 3 . Patients physician receive combine CBI plus OSR intervention ( Group 3 ) subsequently less Clinical Inertia receive CBI alone ( Group 1 ) OSR alone ( Group 2 ) . Specific Aim 2 . Assess impact intervention reduce clinical inertia health care charge . â€¢ Hypothesis 4 . After adjustment baseline measure health care charge , receive intervention ( Group 4 ) , high total health care charge 24-month follow-up , relative patient physician intervention Group 1 , Group 2 , Group 3 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective project improve care adult diabetes ( DM ) implement effective intervention reduce Clinical Inertia relate control glycated hemoglobin ( A1c ) , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) LDL-Cholesterol ( LDL ) primary care office setting . Clinical inertia define lack treatment intensification patient evidence-based goal A1c , SBP , LDL . Clinical Inertia ( CI ) implicate major factor contributes inadequate A1c , SBP , LDL control , document 80 % primary care office visit various setting , despite fact 3 % 23 % adult diabetes simultaneously achieve A1c &lt; 7 % , SBP &lt; 130 mm Hg , LDL &lt; 100 mg/dl . In project test two intervention design reduce clinical inertia . The Cognitive Behavioral Intervention ( CBI ) direct individual primary care physician three component : ( ) analyze physician 's clinical move diabetes patient identify pattern indicate clinical inertia , ( b ) engage physician series simulate clinical case ass underlying cause clinical inertia , ( c ) provide physician series tailor simulated clinical scenario design correct failure think decision make result physician 's observed pattern clinical inertia . The CBI intervention base recent work cognitive science learn theory successfully apply research educational setting . The Office Systems Redesign ( OSR ) Intervention also direct primary care physician three major component : ( ) identify specific patient need intensify diabetes care schedule four consecutive monthly office visit primary care physician , ( b ) provide physician tailor specific clinical decision support time visit base evidence-based treatment algorithm , ( c ) implement physician visit resolution accountability report immediately visit , use tool adapt clinical trial protocol .</detailed_description>
