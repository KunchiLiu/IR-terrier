	<brief_title>Single Agent Erlotinib Chemotherapy-naive Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II open label single center study evaluate activity , efficacy , toxicity single agent Tarceva chemotherapy-naive AIPC patient . Patients receive single agent Tarceva 150 mg daily without interruption disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , investigator 's discretion . Eligible patient documented prostate cancer ( regardless Gleason Score ) consider hormone refractory define . All patient must fail anti-androgen withdrawal trial already therapy . If patient LHRH analogues alone , must fail addition anti-androgen classify hormone refractory . All patient must adequate organ function specify ECOG performance status 2 less . It hypothesize 25 patient need adequately assess activity Tarceva AIPC . The activity Tarceva malignancy demonstrate dosed range 100 150 mg daily . It acceptable interrupt therapy unless toxicity occur disease progression document . Starting patient 150 mg daily seem logical step , dose reduction implement base side effect adverse event .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documented prostate cancer regardless Gleason score Patients consider hormone refractory androgen independent . They must fail LHRH analogue , antiandrogen withdrawal trial . Failure confirm increase PSA value 10 % value immediately , confirm another assessment 2 week later . Patients measurable disease either biochemically use rise PSA or/and metastatic disease bone visceral organ . Performance status 2 less use ECOG scale.Â· Adequate liver function test ALT/AST &lt; 3x normal , total bilirubin 1.5 less , adequate renal function measure creatinine 2.0 mg/dl less . Alkaline phosphatase value never exclusion criterion deem related bone metastasis . Patients need adequate bone marrow function . ANC 1000 , Hgb 9.0 g/dl , platelets 100,000 . If cause affect plts count autoimmune disorder , patient allow study . Patients inadequate bone marrow function deem related bone marrow involvement prostate cancer allow investigator 's discretion . Patients malignancy allow long evidence malignancy present entry time , 3 year since treatment disorder complete . Patients prior exposure investigational therapy include vaccine allow study long last exposure 4 week prior study entry.Patients know bone metastasis allow receive intravenous bisphosphonates aredia zometa . Patients oral bisphosphonates also allow . Chemo Naive Patients prior exposure Tarceva Patients receive prior systemic chemotherapy prostate cancer . Exposure chemotherapy malignancy allow long last chemotherapy complete 3 year prior study entry . Patients prior malignancy exclude except nonmelanoma skin cancer cancer remission last therapy give 3 year prior enrollment . Prior exposure form steroid allow consider exclusion criterion . Performance status 3 use ECOG scale . Known HIV positive status Known CNS involvement prostate cancer</criteria>
