	<brief_title>Study Proxinium Treating Patients With Squamous Cell Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label , multicentre , dose determination study evaluate safety tolerability Proxinium treatment patient advance SCCHN receive least one anti-cancer treatment regimen advance disease . Fifteen patient enrol nine site . All patient histologically confirm SCCHN advance disease consider potential candidate study entry . Patients complete two phase screen term Initial Screening Final Screening . Initial Screening assess EpCAM status patient 's SCCHN prior final screening procedure take place . Patients biopsy advanced disease appropriately collect verification EpCAM-positive SCCHN immunohistochemical method . If EpCAM-positive SCCHN confirm , patient could enter Final Screening determine full eligibility participation study . At begin Final Screening , patient receive least one anti-cancer treatment regimen advance disease . Patients successfully complete Initial Final Screening Principal Target Tumour five additional Target Tumours designate treatment prior Day 1 dosing . Only one target tumour per week inject . The Investigator treat principal target tumour clinically relevant tumour control principal target tumour achieve , point target tumour could choose inject per week dose level Proxinium . The study comprise two stage . In Stage I , recommend dose ( RD ) Proxinium determine base rate dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) within dose cohort . A DLT define occurrence excessive toxicity first four week patient 's treatment Proxinium Stage I study , RD determine . The RD establish high dose one few patient six within dose cohort experience DLT . The initial dose level 500 µg , three patient initially enrol dose cohort . Doses escalate maximum 700 µg de-escalated minimum 260 µg accord prescribe algorithm outline study protocol base number patient experience DLT within dose cohort . Safety data review medical monitor , site investigator enrol patient dose , Viventia Biotech Inc. ( sponsor ) determine escalation de-escalation occur . All Stage I patient , include original RD cohort , remain Stage I continue treatment beyond initial four week original dose assignment . If dose de-escalation deem necessary , Investigators patient receive high dos would notify give option either administer de-escalated dose discontinue treatment . Stage II commence RD determine independent third party review safety data . Patients enrol subsequently receive treatment RD . The RD cohort expand include total 15 patient , safety efficacy evaluation continue assess . Continued safety tolerability well response rate , therapeutic endpoint , survival time , PK parameter , immunogenicity evaluate . Regardless dose cohort , patient treat complete resolution accessible Target Tumours , clinically relevant tumour progression , study drug suspension withdrawal criterion meet . Four week end-of-treatment visit , patient return site follow-up visit include CT scan head neck well assessment , describe study protocol . Subsequently , patient enter post-study surveillance period . Enrolment study halt RD Proxinium determine , hence , Stage II study conduct .</detailed_description>
