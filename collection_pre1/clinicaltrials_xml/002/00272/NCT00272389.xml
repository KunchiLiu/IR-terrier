	<brief_summary>We hypothesize pretreatment nonresponder responder liver tissue would show consistent difference gene expression level difference could use predict treatment outcome obviate need present therapeutic trial.We interested conduct retrospective study use data patient suffer chronic HCV infection treat department combination PEGINTERFERON RIBAVIRIN . All patient underwent liver biopsy prior treatment . Based clinical data available possible determine responder nonresponders therapy.RNA extract liver tissue expression 5 gene ( IFI15 , IFI616 , IFI1 , OAS3 , OAS2 ) check .The prediction power combination gene differentiate responder nonresponders determine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus lead cause chronic liver disease , 170 million people infected worldwide . It also lead indication liver transplantation . Complications chronic hepatitis C infection include cirrhosis , hepatic decompensation , hepatocellular carcinoma . As result , treatment strategy prevent complication widely research , although many question remain unanswered . To date , standard therapy chronic hepatitis C infection combination peginterferon .ribavirin.A large proportion patient respond therapy reason unclear . The heterogeneity viral host phenotype make unlikely single factor accurately predict cellular response treatment.It suppose liver tissue nonresponder responder show consistent difference gene expression level difference could use predict treatment outcomes.Hepatic gene expression profile identify consistent difference patient subsequently fail treatment pegylated IFN-Î± plus ribavirin : up-regulation specific set IFN-responsive gene predicts nonresponse exogenous therapy . These data may use predict clinical response treatment . 18 gene , confirm real-time PCR , expression level differ consistently nonresponders responder liver tissue detect . Levels 18 gene responder liver closer uninfected tissue nonresponders liver , general up-regulation gene expression nonresponders liver . Many gene IFN responsive , suggest nonresponders patient adopt different , yet characteristic , equilibrium host-virus immune response ( Chen L et al . Gastroentology 2005:128:1437-1444 ) We find method predict success failure treatment chronic hepatitis C base weighted expression level small number gene ( 4-5 ) We derive gene decision weight microarray data set obtain liver biopsy patient mention paper . We would like test prediction power method independent set liver tissue treat patient department .</detailed_description>
