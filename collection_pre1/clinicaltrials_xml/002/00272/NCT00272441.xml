	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma complex disease often start early life . Exacerbations trigger number agent allergens , respiratory infection , environmental tobacco smoke pollutant , drug , chemical , exercise , cold air , infection strong emotion make asthma therapy difficult sometimes complicate . Multiple medication often require treat symptom ( bronchodilator agent beta-2 adrenergic agonist , theophylline , anticholinergic ) , well underlie disease process ( anti-inflammatory agent inhaled systemic corticosteroid , cromolyn sodium nedocromil ; leukotriene modifier ) . The prevalence asthma increase age group , particularly child age 18 year . In 1992 , prevalence self-reported asthma among person 18 year age 7.2 percent , compare 5.1 percent among person . The rapid increase asthma occur child 5 year old , rate increase 160 percent past 15 year . Among age , 450,000 hospitalization , 5,000 death , 100 million day restrict activity due asthma every year . Yet burden asthma disproportionately affect child . For example , asthma hospitalization rate high among person age 0-4 year , increase 28 percent last 15 year ; mortality rate increase faster among aged 5 to-12 year among age 15-34 year neither change disease cod improve recognition asthma fully explain increase . Nearly one third child restrict activity due asthma , include participation physical education sport . Despite major advance understand etiology pathophysiology asthma development new therapeutic modality control symptoms prevent exacerbation , effective therapy widely use pediatric health care community . Further , long term effect side effect asthma medication child , especially child age 12 year , well understood . Much remains learned impact asthma therapy different age different point natural history asthma alter progression , chronicity , severity disease . There urgent need rapidly evaluate new exist therapeutic approach child asthma , disseminate finding health care professional , patient public . There several reason pediatric asthma clinical research network accelerate clinical research meet need . The highly variable sometimes complicate clinical manifestation asthma often make difficult accumulate large number comparable patient one center . Further , uniformity treatment protocol may reduce number patient need clinical center . Also , network mechanism help pool necessary clinical expertise administrative resource facilitate conduct multiple novel therapeutic trial timely , efficient manner . This , turn , would promote rapid dissemination research find health care professional . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Prevention Early Asthma Kids ( PEAK ) begin recruitment January 2001 evaluate whether administer inhaled corticosteroid 24-48 month old child risk develop asthma prevent development persistent asthma . All subject expect randomized prior December 2001 study completion September 2004 . The study double blind , randomize , placebo control , parallel comparison inhale fluticasone placebo . There four week run-in period qualify characterize child . A total 285 child randomize one two treatment group ; one receive active treatment , placebo . The study base continuous treatment schedule period twenty-four month , follow observation period one year main outcome assess . The primary outcome measure number asthma-free day . Secondary outcome include number exacerbation , use asthma medication , lung function . There three specific objective study : 1 ) To assess chronic therapy inhale corticosteroid initiate child four year less high risk develop asthma prevent development significant asthma four six year age , 2 ) To determine asthma therapy describe prevent loss lung function development bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) associate early onset asthma , 3 ) To assess potential side effect may associate long term use inhale steroid early life . PEAK study outcomes presented 2005 annual meeting American Academy Allergy , Asthma , Immunology American Thoracic Society . A manuscript submit publication New England Journal Medicine .
