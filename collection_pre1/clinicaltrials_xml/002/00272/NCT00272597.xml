Therefore , - If subject currently treat antipsychotic risperidone , dosage taper gradually discontinue . Simultaneously , oral risperidone start 2 mg/day increase 6 mg/day . The subject treat risperidone monotherapy least five day prior enter stabilization phase study . - On hand , patient already treat 5 day risperidone monotherapy he/she may enter stabilization phase study immediately . Stabilization Phase ( Weeks 1 - 14 ; Days 0 - 98 ) The first three dos risperidone long act ( Days 0 , 14 28 ) 25 mg subject . At time fourth injection ( Day 42 ) , dosage risperidone long act may increase 25 mg IM 37.5 mg IM upon discretion treat physician .

Alternatively , patient currently receive 37.5 mg , subject may increase maximum recommend dosage 50 mg IM every two week . To accommodate latency period ( i.e. , time risperidone release microspheres approach therapeutic plasma level ) , subject enter study continue oral risperidone first three week ( Days 0-21 ) . Temporary oral supplementation also permit anytime stabilization phase study consider treat physician clinically necessary treatment breakthrough psychosis . With one exception , treat physician restrict add discontinue pharmacological treatment deem necessary clinical management subject .
