	<brief_summary>In Congenital Myopathy Research Program Boston Children 's Hospital Harvard Medical School , researcher study congenital myopathy ( neuromuscular disease present birth ) , include central core disease , centronuclear/myotubular myopathy , congenital fiber type disproportion , multiminicore disease , nemaline myopathy , rigid spine muscular dystrophy , SEPN1 RYR1 myopathy undefined congenital myopathy . The primary goal research well understand gene protein ( gene product ) involve muscle function disease . The researcher hope study allow improve diagnosis treatment individual congenital myopathy future . For information , visit Laboratory Website www.childrenshospital.org/research/beggs</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Congenital Myopathy Research Program consist group scientist healthcare provider work good understand congenital myopathy . We take two approach reach research goal . The first involve identify describe new gene protein involve skeletal muscle allow body move . Simultaneously , study underway identify genetic change ( mutation ) cause human neuromuscular disease . Thus , second approach identify mutation , learn inherited family , understand lead weakness individual neuromuscular disease . These approach allow correlation basic muscle biology finding study muscle tissue affect individual . Our research would possible without generous participation individual family congenital myopathy . Participation study free charge . Travel Boston require , welcome participation individual around world . We appreciate participation individual congenital myopathy , well first-degree relative . Participants congenital myopathy ask donate medical record , blood saliva sample , muscle tissue sample ( available ) . Participating relative ask donate blood sample . The blood/saliva sample use acquire DNA ( genetic material ) use identify genetic change study disease inherit family . The medical record employ understand participant 's symptom . The muscle tissue use well understand disease muscular level study gene expression protein level individual congenital myopathy .
