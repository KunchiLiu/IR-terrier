	<detailed_description>The incidence gastrointestinal allergy rise manifest number different clinical presentation . The goal study evaluate measurement CD23 , protein identify stool , urine , blood , non-invasive marker use diagnosis interval assessment patient know suspected gastrointerstianl allergy . Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EE ) disorder typically find school-age adolescent child , prevalent male patient . Patients EE typically present symptom heartburn difficulty swallow . Blood x-ray study may normal display non-specific finding . The diagnosis EE rest combination clinical symptom , result endoscopic histologic study . The endoscopic appearance esophageal mucosa patient often pale display poor vascular pattern . The mucosa thicken appearance . Esophagitis patient acid/peptic disease typically pronounce bottom esophagus , region gastroesophageal junction . In contrast , mucosal disease observe patient EE often pronouced proximal esophagus . Treatment may include topial steroid ( deliver systemically via metered-dose inhaler ) formal allergy evaluation detect potential dietary trigger . Anti-allergic therapy , include monteleukostat , benedryl , antihistimines , cromolyn sodium also propose treatment EE . Treatment efficacy determine combination clinical report serial endoscopic study . There currently biochemical marker use monitor disease course patient . Cow milk protein intolerance ( CMPI ) allergic process affect distal gastrointestinal tract infant . As , often present diarrhea without without presence gross rectal bleeding infant range age birth 6 month age . Children display symptom abdominal disress include cramping , colic , feed difficulty . Emesis feed may also present . Affected child display loose frequent bowel movement . Stools patient may contain mucus well microscopic visible blood . In patient , diagnosis base appropriate clinical history support physical exam ( typically normal ) . Treatment involve removal offend dietary antigen include cow soy milk protein . A small percentage patient ( &lt; 5 % ) require formal endoscopic study . The mucosa patient appear erythematous , friable , display patchy distribution inflammation . Histologic exam reveals vary degree eosinophic infiltration intestinal tissue . Eosinophilic crypt abscess , collection eosinophils within intestine also see . Patients respond therapy display normalization stool frequency , decrease symptom abdominal discomfort , absence gross microscopic intestinal bleeding . CD23 protein find allergy-type white blood cell ( eosinophil ) , well cell line gastrointestinal tract . Previous study report increased level CD23 infants cow 's milk allergy . CD23 also elevate infant child allergic disease , compare child without apparent atopic disease . Moreover , level CD23 appear fall conjunction therapy . The development non-invasive marker intestinal allergy would facilitate diagnosis well provide clinicians tool ass patient compliance response therapy . The relationship level serum , urinary , fecal CD23 level previously study patient know suspected intestinal allergy . Subjects study ask provide blood , urine , stool sample present symptom either cow milk protein intolerance eosinophilic esophagitis . Blood obtain clinical sample request , extra blood drawing require participation study . Similar blood , urine , stool specimen obtain patient place anti-atopic therapy experience clinical remission .</detailed_description>
