	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Adjuvant Improving Immune Response Hepatitis B Virus Vaccine HIV Infected Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) greatly improve life HIV infected individual . Before introduction HAART , impact HBV infection liver disease less prominent due rapid progression AIDS . However , use HAART , liver disease become leading cause death HIV infected individual ; therefore , prevention HBV infection essential . Most HIV infected people respond poorly HBV vaccine . GM-CSF cytokine produce primarily activate T B cell use extensively hematopoietic growth factor . GM-CSF increase neutrophil count , improve antigen-presenting cell function , involve development improvement cellular immune response . Past research show GM-CSF improves immune response HBV vaccination people kidney disease . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness GM-CSF adjuvant improve immune response HBV vaccination HIV infected individual . This study last 60 week . Participants randomly assign 1 2 arm . Arm A participant receive 40 mcg HBV vaccine study entry , Week 4 , Week 12 . Arm B participant receive 40 mcg HBV vaccine 250 mcg GM-CSF study entry , Week 4 , Week 12 . Participants stratify screen HIV-1 viral load . After complete vaccination series , study visit occur Weeks 16 , 36 , 60 . Blood collection , physical exam , liver function hepatitis antibody test complete study visit . Telephone follow-up study staff occur 48 96 hour post-vaccination .</detailed_description>
