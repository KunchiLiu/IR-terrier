	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Cell Gene Transfer Individuals With Fanconi Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FA rare , inherited disease cause gene defect primarily affect individual 's bone marrow , result decrease production blood cell . The lack white blood cell affect individual 's ability fight infection , lack platelet may result bleeding , lack red blood cell usually lead anemia . FA typically diagnose childhood , high fatality rate . Bone marrow transplant one common treatment FA . However , many risk associate transplantation , include rejection transplant cell graft-versus-host disease , serious side effect donor cell attack recipient 's tissue . This study use experimental gene transfer procedure perform laboratory insert new FA gene participant 's bone marrow cell . The gene-corrected bone marrow cell re-infused participant participant observe successful gene transfer . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness FA gene transfer procedure determine ability gene-corrected cell generate new , healthy blood cell individual FA . This study enroll individual FA . Participants require initial bone marrow transfer procedure perform Cincinnati Children 's Hospital , allow see doctor majority study visit . Participants first attend screen visit , include physical exam , blood draw laboratory testing , bone marrow biopsy . Bone marrow cell collect eligible participant send laboratory FA gene transfer procedure . Several day later , gene-corrected cell re-infused back participant via intravenous catheter . Side effect closely monitor 12 hour follow procedure participant may require spend overnight hospital . Following discharge hospital , participant require stay Cincinnati area 3 day undergo daily evaluation physical examination . Participants continue follow closely first year cell re-infusion . Study visit hold weekly first 3 week , every 3 month remainder year . Visits include physical examination , blood collection , liver function testing . Bone marrow test occur Months 3 , 6 , 12 . Follow-up visit occur yearly 15 year include blood collection , physical exam , review medical history .</detailed_description>
