	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma complex disease often start early life . Exacerbations trigger number agent allergens , respiratory infection , environmental tobacco smoke pollutant , drug , chemical , exercise , cold air , infection strong emotion make asthma therapy difficult sometimes complicate . Multiple medication often require treat symptom ( bronchodilator agent beta-2 adrenergic agonist , theophylline , anticholinergic ) , well underlie disease process ( anti-inflammatory agent inhaled systemic corticosteroid , cromolyn sodium nedocromil ; leukotriene modifier ) . The prevalence asthma increase age group , particularly child age 18 year . In 1992 , prevalence self-reported asthma among person 18 year age 7.2 percent , compare 5.1 percent among person . The rapid increase asthma occur child 5 year old , rate increase 160 percent past 15 year . Among age , 450,000 hospitalization , 5,000 death , 100 million day restrict activity due asthma every year . Yet burden asthma disproportionately affect child . For example , asthma hospitalization rate high among person age 0-4 year , increase 28 percent last 15 year ; mortality rate increase faster among aged 5 to-12 year among age 15-34 year neither change disease cod improve recognition asthma fully explain increase . Nearly one third child restrict activity due asthma , include participation physical education sport . Despite major advance understand etiology pathophysiology asthma development new therapeutic modality control symptoms prevent exacerbation , effective therapy widely use pediatric health care community . Further , long term effect side effect asthma medication child , especially child age 12 year , well understood . Much remains learned impact asthma therapy different age different point natural history asthma alter progression , chronicity , severity disease . There urgent need rapidly evaluate new exist therapeutic approach child asthma , disseminate finding health care professional , patient public . There several reason pediatric asthma clinical research network accelerate clinical research meet need . The highly variable sometimes complicate clinical manifestation asthma often make difficult accumulate large number comparable patient one center . Further , uniformity treatment protocol may reduce number patient need clinical center . Also , network mechanism help pool necessary clinical expertise administrative resource facilitate conduct multiple novel therapeutic trial timely , efficient manner . This , turn , would promote rapid dissemination research find health care professional . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial ( PACT ) study determine comparative effectiveness inhale corticosteroid , leukotriene receptor antagonist , combination medication inhale corticosteroid long-acting beta2-agonist child mild asthma . The study address critical question face primary care physician optimal choice initiate daily long-term treatment child . The primary study outcome percentage day without asthma 12-month treatment period . Recruitment begin August , 2002 . A total 300 child assign one three active treatment arm 12 month : active ICS ; combination active ICS salmeterol ; active montelukast ( LTRA ) . Major outcome follow-up 277 child present May , 2005 American Thoracic Society meeting . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
