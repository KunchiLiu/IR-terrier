	<brief_summary>Cure rate patient high grade glioma remain disappointing , part tumor cell often resistant chemotherapy , use high dos chemotherapy cause damage normal blood cell . This trial design try overcome barrier . The idea make tumor cell sensitive chemotherapy agent , Temozolomide , use 06Benzylguanine ( 06BG ) . In addition , patient portion blood cell modify insertion chemotherapy resistance gene may help protect blood cell damage combination Temozolomide 06BG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Newly Diagnosed Brain Tumors With Chemotherapy Radiation Using Cells Modified Chemoprotection Experimental Drug Decrease Tumor Cell Resistance Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use temozolomide ( TEM ) irradiation promise new approach treatment patient high-grade glioma . However , treatment limited tumor cell resistance therapy-related hematologic toxicity . To overcome TEM resistance , study add chemotherapy sensitize drug O6-Benzylguanine ( BG ) . To overcome hematologic toxicity , patient receive autologous hematopoietic stem cell transduce chemotherapy resistance gene design protect cell subsequent therapy drug combination . The potential benefit use transduce blood stem cell possibility dose escalation TEM , since hematologic toxicity heretofore limit high dos . Transduction accomplish retroviral vector carry MGMTP140K , code mutate form resistance protein methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) . Successful transduction hematopoietic cell MGMTP140K make resistant toxic effect TEM + BG . Repeated dos drug therefore result increase percentage transduce ( thus protect ) blood stem cell , thus reduce likelihood hematologic toxicity therapy . Accordingly , patient tolerate therapy well laboratory evidence chemoprotection receive intrapatient dose escalation TEM + BG course 2-6 . Eligible patient must 5 55 year age newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma ( anaplastic astrocytoma glioblastoma multiforme ) completely resect . No prior therapy surgery allow , patient must adequate performance status organ function define protocol .</detailed_description>
