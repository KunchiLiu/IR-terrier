	<detailed_description>Context : Sleep loss associate increase blood level interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . Medical resident often deprive normal sleep extend work shift , effect work-related sleep loss biomarkers vascular inflammation function unknown . Objective : We seek test hypothesis sleep loss extend work shift medical training associate increase circulating level pro-inflammatory biomarkers evidence vascular dysfunction . Design : Outcome measure assess extend 30-hour work shift non-extended 6-hour work shift single-blind , randomized crossover design . Setting : University hospital medical intensive care unit Patients Other Participants : Twenty-two healthy medical resident study medical intensive care unit rotation . Main Outcome Measure ( ) : Sleep related cytokine ( interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor ) , serum marker vascular inflammation ( C-reactive protein ) , flow-mediated dilation brachial artery .</detailed_description>
