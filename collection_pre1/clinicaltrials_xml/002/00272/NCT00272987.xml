	<brief_summary>Patients randomise 1:1 ratio receive either paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV weekly three week four week cycle , trastuzumab 4 mg/kg load dose 2 mg/kg weekly IV , oral lapatinib 1000 mg QD paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV weekly three week four week cycle , trastuzumab 4 mg/kg load dose 2 mg/kg weekly IV plus placebo . The primary objective study evaluate compare time progression ( TTP ) . Secondary objective evaluate compare two treatment arm respect : overall response rate , clinical benefit , time response , duration response , progression-free survival , overall survival . The study first enroll open label safety cohort 20 patient assess tolerability triplet combination .</brief_summary>
