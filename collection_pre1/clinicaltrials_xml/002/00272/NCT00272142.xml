	<brief_summary>There currently intervention available substantially reduce incidence low birth weight ( LBW ) apart increase age marriage , maternal iron supplementation possibly improve energy intake . The current view medical public health community India immediate focus promote survival development low birth weight infant nearly 6 7 fold high mortality infancy normal birth weight . Low serum zinc associate increase incidence diarrhea pneumonia . There sufficient evidence under-threes acute illness , zinc supplementation ( 1-2 recommend dietary allowance [ RDA ] ) reduce incidence episode diarrhea , severe diarrhea pneumonia . A number initial publish trial also show significant effect zinc treatment pneumonia . With large consistent effect zinc supplementation incidence severity infection , effect child mortality likely . Available literature suggest distinct possibility reduce neonatal infant mortality LBWs receive 1 RDA zinc daily . A pilot study India show 54 % reduction mortality LBW infant . These finding base small sample therefore consider insufficient change policy . A positive impact propose study provide important tool reduction infant mortality currently stagnant government acceptance program likely high . We , researcher Society Applied Studies , believe study potential decreasing infant mortality current level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Zinc Supplementation Low Birth Weight Infants Severe Morbidity , Mortality Zinc Status : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double blind , randomize , placebo control trial conduct unit randomization 14-28 day old infant . Infants intervention group receive 1 RDA elemental zinc compare placebo control group , day enrollment till 12 month age . Infants enrollment identify daily screen newborn two hospital . Eligible infant visit home enrollment age 14-28 day . The mother train supplement administration . A total 2000 infant enrol . Infants intervention group administer dispersible tablet daily contain 1 RDA elemental zinc ( 5 mg elemental zinc per day infant age 14 day 6 month 10 mg per day infant older 6 month ) daily till 12 month age . The placebo contain plain glucose similar taste , color consistency zinc tablet . The tablet package strip contain 15 tablet . Monthly supply supplement give caregiver keep home . The supplement administer caregiver ( usually mother ) method administration teach time enrollment . At end every four week monitor collect strip previous month record supplement intake previous month examine strip query caregiver . Three monthly morbidity visit conduct field investigator obtain information hospitalization cause last 3 month , healthcare provider visit last 1 month , illness make severity illness , diarrhea respiratory morbidity previous 24 hour , week month . If infant hospitalize last 3 month , hospitalization form fill ascertain reason hospitalization . In case death , interview conduct caregiver verbal autopsy form fill . Blood specimen estimation plasma zinc , copper ferritin obtain 15 % randomly select child baseline end study . Weights length obtain subset child birth , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month .</detailed_description>
