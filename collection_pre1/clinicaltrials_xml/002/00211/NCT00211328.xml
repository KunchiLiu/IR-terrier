	<brief_summary>Idiopathic Perifoveal telangiectasia poorly understood disorder involve growth blood vessel around center macula ( perifoveal region ) . These blood vessel may extrend beneath retina produce area sub-retinal neosvascularization ( growth abnormal blood vessel retina `` leak '' fluid , cause reduction vision . Limited form treatment available manage neovascularization consequence . Anecortave Acetate injection consider attempt control growth abnormal blood vessel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Idiopathic Perifoveal Telangiectasia ( IPT ) With Open-Label Anecortave Acetate ( 15mg . ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In open-label pilot study , initial patient , present IPT SRN , treat promising success five additional patient recruit . So report six eye first six patient disease present practice . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) grant site permission enroll patient . While anecortave acetate yet approve FDA , use phase 2/3 trial treatment AMD . An informed consent obtain patient . IRB approval obtain Manhattan Eye , Ear , Throat Hospital . Patients receive posterior juxtascleral injection 15 mg anecortave acetate deliver adjacent macula use specially design curve cannula Alcon , Inc . Visual acuity ( VA ) intraocular pressure ( IOP ) measure study visit . Fluorescein angiography use complement standard clinical biomicroscopic examination macula baseline 3 month interval . On first day post-injection , patient additional ophthalmic examination include VA testing , biomicroscopy , IOP measurement . A 6-month retreatment interval establish study base laboratory data demonstrate anecortave acetate administer slow-release depot adjacent posterior scleral surface provide therapeutic drug level adjacent choroid retina 6 month ( 9 ) . If patient clinically unstable unimproved six month enrollment , offer thermal laser treatment photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) conjunction anecortave acetate injection . Patients unstable early 3 month enrollment offer option treat either thermal laser PDT . This disqualify eligible repeat anecortave acetate injection month 6 .</detailed_description>
