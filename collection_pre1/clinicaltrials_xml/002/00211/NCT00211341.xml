	<brief_summary>Main objective : To evaluate impact weekly vitamin A supplementation ( VAS ) woman reproductive age ( 15-45 year ) maternal mortality rural Ghana , compare impact overall mortality . Hypotheses : 1 . Weekly supplementation vitamin A ( 7000 µg retinol equivalent [ RE ] ) reproductive age woman reduce maternal death 33 % . 2 . This impact achieve reduction pregnancy-related non-pregnancy-related death . 3 . There reduction non-maternal death , similar size maternal non-pregnancy related death . Outcome measure : Maternal mortality rate , overall mortality rate . Deaths identify monthly demographic surveillance , classify maternal ( pregnancy-related , non-pregnancy-related ) non-maternal use verbal autopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Impact Vitamin A Maternal Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnancy account nearly 600,000 death woman year ; maternal health problem large contributor disease burden adult woman . Conventional primary health care approach , include Traditional Birth Attendant training antenatal screening , little impact maternal mortality ratio . Instead , Safe Motherhood paradigm aim ensure emergency obstetric care ( EMOC ) district hospital level 10-15 % woman develop potentially life threatening complication , move towards recommend professional attend delivery . While latter configuration care show reduce maternal mortality , require considerable political , attention health system , expansion access supervise delivery EMOC . For poor country , capacity year line . Low-tech intervention effectively reduce maternal mortality , deliver community level would welcome addition armamentarium public health measure prevent maternal mortality . Should vitamin A supplementation prove effective reduce maternal mortality , indeed all-cause female mortality , would provide tool . Moreover , considerable policy programmatic interest VAS child , likely interest broaden encompass supplementation woman . Furthermore , increasingly recognised poverty increase risk ill health , ill health turn play major role create perpetuate poverty . A community-based intervention Vitamin A likely address need poor woman , individual least likely access emergency obstetric care professional birth attendant . This cluster-randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial . All woman age 15 45 year randomise , accord cluster residence receive weekly capsule either 7000 RE vitamin A peanut oil identical look placebo capsule contain peanut oil . Thus , supplement deliver woman antenatal inter-pregnancy period . The trial conduct Kintampo Health Research Centre ( KHRC ) four contiguous district - Kintanpo , Techiman , Wenchi Nkoranza -- Brong Ahafo region Ghana . The district fall within forest-savannah transitional ecological zone , vitamin A rich food source less available forest region south . Data previous study KHRC national prevalence survey , indicate VAD problem public health significance area -- 26 % breastmilk sample retinol concentration low 30µg/dl , exceed WHO cut-off 25 % define area severe problem ( WHO , 1996 ) . VAS find substantially reduce childhood morbidity mortality similar area , thus suitable test potential benefit VAS woman . All woman age 15-45 year permanent resident study area eligible recruitment trial . They identify exist database . Permanent residence define resident area three month precede start recruitment , intention remain study area follow 12 month . There exclusion participation , except woman nightblindness sign VAD . These , woman develop VAD course study treat accord current IVACG recommendation ( IVACG , 1997 ) . They continue follow , give vitamin A consider separately analysis . Continuous recruitment do woman migrate study area , become eligible age study progress . Allocation treatment determine cluster residence .</detailed_description>
