	<detailed_description>1 . Rationale objective To assess influence celecoxib relapse-free survival completely resect patient poor prognosis indicate metastatic involvement intrapulmonary/hilar ( pN1 ) ipsilateral mediastinal ( pN2 ) lymph node . Celecoxib , selective oral COX-2 inhibitor , find exert significant anti-proliferative activity variety tumor cell line vitro , include NSCLC . COX-2 frequently up-regulated NSCLC cell line archival tumor sample . Its high expression also correlate poor prognosis patient . Proposed mechanisms action selective COX-2 inhibitor include inhibition angiogenesis , inhibition matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression induction apoptosis . A clinical trial address role celecoxib adjuvant treatment radically operate patient high risk relapse warrant . 2 . Study design A multicenter , international , randomize , double-blind , placebo control phase III clinical trial 3 . Primary endpoint The primary endpoint relapse-free survival ( time local distant relapse ) study . 4 . Other endpoint Secondary end-points include : - overall survival ( time death cause ) - safety long-term administration celecoxib 5 . Statistical method The primary objective , i.e . relapse-free survival ( RFS ) , record time randomization date local distant relapse ( date radiological image demonstrate relapse date histological confirmation relapse date relapse clinical examination , data available ) death cause , whichever occur first . Patients alive without relapse end follow-up consider censored observation . The study aim verification null hypothesis Ho : RFS control group = RFS treat group vs. alternative HA : RFS control group ≠RFS treat group Primary secondary efficacy analysis perform use intention-to-treat principle . The distribution RFS OS compare treatment arm summarize graphically use Kaplan-Meier method compare log-rank test . The result test assess use 5 % significance level ( two-sided ) . The effect treatment distribution RFS OS evaluate score test base Cox proportional hazard model , include stratification relevant clinical factor covariates . The proportion patient experience AE , serious AE , specific type AEs proportion withdrawal compare treatment arm use chi-square test 5 % significance level ( two-sided ) . 6 . Translational research A research project evaluate immunohistochemical expression COX-2 , VEGF CD34 marker vascular density perform . These parameter analyze central laboratory two independent pathologist involve angiogenesis research . Immunohistochemical method carefully validate commencement translational research part study . The study center request provide post-operative tissue sample ( paraffin-embedded block 5 unstained slide ) primary tumor . 7 . Medication Trt.groups Drug Form Route Dose interval Dosing No . patient 1 . Celecoxib tablets p.o . 400 mg 12 h 271 2 . Placebo tablets p.o . 400 mg 12 h 271</detailed_description>
