	<brief_title>A Study Risk Factors Anti-erythropoietin Antibody Positive Pure Red Cell Aplasia Among Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Receiving Epoetin Alfa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter ( study conduct multiple site ) , case-control ( study compare individual disease condition [ case ] group individual without disease condition [ control ] determine possible factor increase disease incidence ) , retrospective ( study participant identify follow backward , time pass ) study . Retrospective risk factor data collect control participant match subset participant Protocol EPO-IMU-301 identify chronic kidney disease anti-EPO antibody positive PRCA begin participant receiving treatment EPREX ( index participant ) . For index participant , 4 match non-PRCA control participant chronic kidney disease enrol study . Approximately 600 control participant enrol study . Control participants select site index participant data collect date closest reference date ( loss efficacy [ drop hemoglobin great 2 g/dL/month ] first see ) control participant satisfies study inclusion exclusion criterion . The optional pharmacogenomic part ( test polymorphism haploid type erythropoietin gene ) record control participant sign pharmacogenomics part study . No drug administration treatment mandate study . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event .</detailed_description>
