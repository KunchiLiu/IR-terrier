	<brief_summary>Autism , originally describe Kanner ( 1943 ) , among severe neuropsychiatric disorder . It pervasive developmental disorder affect social , communicative , compulsive/repetitive behavior characterize stereotypic complex hand body movement , crave sameness , narrow repetitive interest . Individuals autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) characteristically heterogeneous show mark variability response intervention . Studies behavioral psychopharmacological intervention document approximately 1/3 ASD participant fail respond target treatment . Efforts evaluate specificity treatment effect important inform conceptualization disorder , identify behavioral phenotype , aide clinical decision making . The goal study evaluate use clinical behavioral pharmacology method , functional behavioral assessment ( FBA ) , assess treatment effect pediatric medication child ASD . The present study FBA procedures pharmacological treatment conduct separate , parallel study within IRB approve , federally fund , double-masked , placebo control medication trial citalopram ( GCO # 01-1295 PS* ) , SSRI hypothesize reduce stereotyped repetitive behavior ASD divalproex sodium ( GCO # 01-0294 ) , medication recently find reduce repetitive behavior ASD ( Hollander et al. , press ) . This study focus use FBAs distinguish responder vs. nonresponders basis behavior function , evaluate functional pattern stereotypy , aggression , impulsivity , use descriptive FBAs outcome measure clinical trial . FBAs behavioral assessment method use hypothesize function maladaptive behavior . FBAs conduct either experimental manipulation know functional analysis descriptive analysis procedure , involve structure observation parent/caregiver interview . Descriptive analysis conduct participant ( n=24 ) . The rigorous , functional analysis conduct sub-set sample ( n=6 ) corroborate finding descriptive analysis . Data FBAs collect use videotaped recording behavior cod trained raters descriptive experimental analysis . Our pilot data publish data suggest certain medication citalopram ( celexa ) divalproex sodium ( Depakote ) may improve global functioning autistic patient repetitive/compulsive behavior social deficit . The addition FBA method evaluate outcome important step extend research knowledge condition associate good poor treatment response pediatric medication child autism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Functional Behavioral Assessments Evaluate Stereotypy Repetitive Behaviors Double-blind , Placebo Controlled Trials Various Medications Used Treat Children With Autism .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research gear towards increase knowledge variable contribute treatment response critical advance intervention study ASD . Literature grow field clinical behavioral pharmacology suggest functional behavioral assessment ( FBA ) , integrated clinical trial medication , important tool elucidate specificity treatment effect ( Mace &amp; Mauk , 1995 , Northup &amp; Gully , 2001 ) . The goal study evaluate use clinical behavioral pharmacology method , primarily descriptive functional behavioral assessment ( FBA ) , double-masked , placebo control trial medication use treat child autism . These medication hypothesize reduce stereotyped repetitive behavior ASD . This study focus use descriptive FBAs distinguish responder vs. non-responders basis behavior function , evaluate functional pattern stereotypy , use descriptive FBAs outcome measure clinical trial . This study accordance CAN research priority focus improve methodological approach clinical trial ( Hollander , et al. , 2004 ) . This study also consistent recent NIMH recommendation clinical research . The recommendation identify integration behavioral research method traditional method clinical research ( i.e . group design ) important aim ASD treatment research ( CPEA/STAART work group , 2004 ) . As , study fill significant gap two research area : treatment repetitive behavior research methodology treatment trial individual ASD . The bio-behavioral method propose use evaluation previously use stratify match treatment self-injurious behavior adult developmental disability ( Mace &amp; Mauk , 1995 ) , identify specific treatment effect methylphenidate child ADHD ( Northup &amp; Gully , 2001 ) , recently evaluate specificity risperidone 's effect destructive behavior individual autism ( Crosland , et al , 2003 ) . Despite stereotyped repetitive behavior core symptom domain ASD , behavioral pharmacology approach date evaluate correlate symptom aggression , self-injurious , destructive behavior ASD . Repetitive behavior ASD include stereotypic movement , repetition routine behavior , repetitive play , perseverative speech , over-focus restricted interest . These repetitive movement may associate emotional distress , tension , dysphoria significant impact daily life . It believe method use elucidate specify treatment effect medication disorder also valuable understand SSRI effect autism . Both behavioral pharmacological treatment use treat repetitive stereotype behavior autism . Behavioral treatment include use noncontingent reinforcement ( Britton , et al. , 2002 ) alternative response training maintain homeostasis ( Johnson , Laarhoven , &amp; Repp , 2002 ) . Psychopharmacological approach include use SSRIs give similarity repetitive behavior autism OCD ( McDougle , 1995 ) evidence serotonin dysfunction ASD ( Hollander , 2000 ) . To date , control study SSRIs pediatric population ASD . Hollander &amp; colleague ( Hollander , et al. , press ) Mt . Sinai recently complete study suggest efficacy low-dose liquid fluoxetine reduce repetitive behavior double-blind , placebo control crossover study 45 child ASD . This propose FBA evaluation would occur within another SSRI trial Mt . Sinai , aim extend previous finding large scale , multisite investigation safety efficacy liquid citalopram child ASD . Behavioral pharmacology method Functional behavioral assessment ( FBA ) cornerstone clinical behavioral pharmacology approach . The goal FBAs hypothesize experimentally test function maladaptive behavior . Within field behavior analysis , determine function maladaptive behavior primary develop effective intervention . FBAs involve experimental descriptive assessment behavior function . Experimental method , also know functional analysis ( Iwata , et al. , 1982/1994 ) , advantage use experimental manipulation direct , continuous observation behavior . The procedure outline Iwata , et al . ( 1982/1994 ) consider gold-standard functional analysis . The procedure involve use multi-element , single-subject experimental design . During functional analysis , consequence present maladaptive behavior vary . The experimental condition outline Iwata , et al . ( 1982/1994 ) label presumed function test condition include : escape/avoidance , attention , automatic reinforcement/self-stimulation , control ( i.e . preferred toys + social attention ) . Experimental method provide valuable reliable data behavior function , involve significant time expense patient experimenter . In contrast , descriptive method base parent/caregiver-report , direct behavioral observation , provide information consequent antecedent predictor behavior . Descriptive method strongly correlate experimental analysis advantage information provide antecedent function relative cost-effectiveness ( Horner , et al. , 1997 ) . This study pilot use descriptive assessment method outcome measure use experimental FBAs corroborate result descriptive analysis . The method outcome investigation use design independent clinical trial use multi-method approach , include descriptive experimental FBAs outcome measure , medication study repetitive behavior ASD . Given research limit funding option outside CAN , fund project may critical , preliminary step improve treatment-specificity research clinical research method ASD . Specific Aims The primary aim study determine usability functional behavioral assessment ( FBA ) procedures predict measure treatment response within clinical trial citalopram , SSRI hypothesize reduce repetitive behavior ASD . The specific aim study follow : 1 . To predict treatment response result descriptive FBAs . 2 . To evaluate functional pattern stereotypy/repetitive behavior ASD . 3 . To evaluate use descriptive FBAs outcome measure SSRI trial ASD correlate result descriptive FBAs standard global rating measure Child Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( CYBOCS ) Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) repetitive behavior stereotypy .</detailed_description>
