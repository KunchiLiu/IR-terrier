	<brief_title>A Study Confirm Safety Efficacy Epoetin Alfa ( PROCRIT ) Administered Perioperatively vs. Standard Care Blood Conservation Patients Undergoing Major Elective Spinal Surgery ( SPINE Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study demonstrate clinically important additional risk deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) adult spine surgery use perisurgical regimen epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) versus standard care blood conservation . Spine surgery select population study anti-coagulant therapy always administer association surgery type . In addition , efficacy epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) protect patient receive allogeneic red cell transfusion across adult spinal procedure study . Patients schedule elective spinal surgery , agree participate study , meet eligibility criterion randomly assign epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) standard care . No perioperative anti-coagulation therapy administer study . The study hypothesis increase risk DVT patient receive perisurgical epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) treatment . Epoetin alfa ( PROCRIT® ) 600U/kg administer per week 3 week prior surgery day surgery .</detailed_description>
