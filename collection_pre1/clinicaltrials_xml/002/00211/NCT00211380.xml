	<brief_summary>This sister study BMS `` Cognitive Improvement Aripiprazole ( Abilify ) '' study ( LSUHSC # H04-022 ) . Evaluation cognitive ability patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder switch risperidone , olanzapine , risperidone Consta injection aripiprazole may reveal cognitive change correlate improve response , good side effect profile , effect component negative symptom array . Further , examination brain functional activity use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) episodic memory task , well behavioral performance associate electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data work memory intermediate term verbal memory collect Sustained Attention Memory Brain Function Test ( SAM-BFT ) , may also provide data show neural correlate change cognition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Improvement With Aripiprazole ( Abilify ) Patients With Schizophrenia ( SFBRI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Our long-range goal understand schizophrenic brain abnormal , well function brain change response antipsychotic medication , good understand effectively treat disorder drug . This information use disorder well , many psychiatric disorder target new atypical antipsychotic . - The objective application , next step pursuit long-range goal , compare response series cognitive test ( verbal learning , work memory , attention ) change brain activity group patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder take risperidone , olanzapine , risperidone Consta injection switch aripiprazole , group normal control subject evaluate twice control learning effect . - The central hypothesis application patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder take aripiprazole improvement cognition consistent medication 's efficacy . We expect change brain activity ( fMRI EEG ) correlate improvement , determine performance cognitive test . Further , change regional connectivity affect brain region reflect specific cognitive change relate aripiprazole . - The rationale propose study , good understand drug improve cognition brain region respond differentially aripiprazole risperidone , olanzapine , risperidone Consta , well understanding functional difference tie differential action drug . This important , really n't understand medication affect cognition . We especially well suited undertake propose research access large population patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder institution .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients ( n=10 ) : All patient include study Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSMIV ) diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . Outpatients schizophrenia ( DSMIV 295.00 , 295.10 , 295.30 , 295.60 , 295.90 ) schizoaffective disorder ( DSMIV 295.70 ) primary source subject project , although inpatient discharge also acceptable . All patient follow longitudinally . Patients 1865 year age accept . Patients screen medical psychiatric diagnosis . At time examination test , patient must stable take either olanzapine 10 mg per day least two week , least 2 mg risperidone per day least two week , risperidone Consta injection ( least 25 mg every two week ) take anticholinergic medication least one week . While recruit stable patient study , necessarily mean free side effect free symptom schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . Patients express desire switch aripiprazole may side effect , may worry increase dose current medication may cause side effect . Controls ( n=10 ) : The normal control group provide image normal response behavioral functional measure , well control scanrescan ( learn , novelty ) effect . They match age , sex , handedness , level education patient . They screen medical psychiatric diagnosis . Patients : Any comorbid major psychiatric diagnosis ( major depressive disorder , obsessivecompulsive disorder , generalize anxiety disorder , panic disorder , disorder psychosis use inclusion criterion , bipolar disorder ) . Any significant unstable medical disorder ( include unstable uncontrolled diabetes ; long term , severe , uncontrolled hypertension ; neurological disorder ) . Clinical judgment use casebycase basis . Special care take examine patient metabolic disturbance hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia , due increase risk problem relate use antipsychotic . Patients clinically unstable markedly abnormal metabolic profile exclude . Active alcohol substance dependence . Significant alcohol substance abuse past six week alcohol substance dependence past year ( defined DSMIV ) . Unable speak , read understand English , study doctor think patient follow study procedure . Inability understand purpose study give consent . Subject hearing impaired . Subject lefthanded . Significant abnormality physical/neurological examination consistent inclusive diagnosis . Current treatment classical antipsychotic medication . Current treatment anticholinergic medication . History adverse response previous lack response aripiprazole . Pregnant lactating woman . Women childbearing potential use medically accept mean contraception ( e.g. , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , birth control pill , barrier device , implanted hormone ) . Handedness track , lefthanded patient exclude due small sample size variance add cognitive testing . Controls : Current treatment psychotropic anticholinergic medication . Any major psychiatric diagnosis ( major depressive disorder , obsessivecompulsive disorder , generalize anxiety disorder , panic disorder , disorder psychosis , bipolar disorder , attentiondeficit/hyperactivity , learn developmental disorder ) . Any significant medical disorder ( include unstable uncontrolled diabetes ; long term , severe , uncontrolled hypertension ; neurological disorder ) . Clinical judgment use casebycase basis . Any active alcohol substance dependence past six week . Significant alcohol substance abuse past six week , alcohol substance dependence past year ( defined DSMIV ) . Inability speak , read understand English , study doctor think patient follow study procedure . Inability understand purpose study give inform consent . Significant abnormality physical/neurological examination . Subject hearing impaired . Subject lefthanded . Pregnant lactating woman . Women childbearing potential use medically accept mean contraception ( e.g. , IUD , birth control pill , barrier device , implanted hormone ) . Dropout criterion : subject begin study able finish study track . Ongoing criterion termination study include : Adverse event intolerable patient prevent continue involvement study . New onset medical disorder significance prohibit involvement . New onset major psychiatric disorder . Initiation recurrence alcohol substance abuse/dependence . Subject withdraws consent reason .</criteria>
