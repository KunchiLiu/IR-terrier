	<brief_summary>Data suggest consensus interferon ( CIFN ) great antiviral activity vitro compare interferon alfa-2a alfa-2b . Several clinical study also suggest CIFN great antiviral activity patient genotype 1 hepatitis C infection , particularly give daily injection . These data indicate use regimen daily CIFN ribavirin lead great virologic response rate compare pegylated interferon alfa-2b ribavirin patient genotype 1 infection , comparable adverse event . Emerging data indicate HCV genotype 1 patient delay virologic response initial therapy may benefit extended duration therapy . Therefore , goal pilot study determine tolerability efficacy daily CIFN plus ribavirin give 52 week extend duration therapy . The target population consist `` difficult-to-treat '' patient , define follow characteristic : genotype 1 , North American patient population , predominantly male gender , specific exclusion pre-existing psychiatric substance abuse co-morbidities .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hepatitis C Treatment Naive Genotype 1 Consensus Interferon Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment hepatitis C pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin . This treatment inadequate patient HCV genotype 1 , since majority patient respond ( termed non-responders ) respond relapse ( termed relapsers ) follow termination treatment . Data Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) Hepatitis C Registry community hospital indicate large majority patient identify hepatitis C characteristic associated poor treatment response remain untreated time . Data suggest consensus interferon ( CIFN , CIFN interferon alfacon-1 ) great antiviral activity vitro compare interferon alfa-2a alfa-2b . Preliminary data indicate patient genotype 1 respond CIFN ribavirin current standard treatment , due fact approximately 25 % patient nonresponders pegylated interferon ribavirin may sustain response regimen daily CIFN ribavirin . Furthermore , difficult treat patient may benefit long duration therapy standard 48 week regimen base initial virologic response therapy occur . Aims : To determine safety efficacy ( A ) daily CIFN ( 15 mcg/d sq ) ribavirin ( 1-1.2 gm/d PO ) give 52 week , v ( B ) daily CIFN ( 15 mcg/d sq ) ribavirin ( 1-1.2 gm/d PO ) give 52 72 week treatment-na√Øve patient hepatitis C genotype 1 , treatment duration base virologic response initial 24 week . Methods : Patients meet eligibility criterion stratify race randomize one two treatment arm , patient viral kinetics measure quantitative PCR week 4,8,12,16,20 24 . Patients treatment arm A follow `` standard '' stopping rule , i.e. , 2-log drop viremia 12 week treatment discontinue , otherwise receive 52 week treatment also qualitative PCR negative week 24 . In treatment arm B patient monitor monthly virologic response ( define &gt; 2 log drop viral level baseline ) quantitative PCR 24 week . Once virologic response quantitative PCR treatment continue additional 48 week . In group , treatment stop patient become negative HCV RNA qualitative PCR 24 week therapy . A total 192 patient 10-20 site recruit . The primary endpoint would number achieve sustain virologic response ; secondary endpoint percentage patient complete therapy , significant adverse event , relationship early virologic response 4 week period 4 24 week achieve sustain virologic response . Sample size determination : To detect absolute difference 20 % sustain virologic response treatment arm A B ; Log-rank test perform alpha level .05 test maintain least 80 percent statistical power ; estimate total 96 patient treatment arm require . Analysis : Univariate multivariate analysis use determine factor associate final endpoint . Subgroup analyse do base time early virologic response duration therapy stratification . The primary secondary endpoint determine intention-to-treat basis start patient receive least one dose study medication . The primary secondary endpoint also determine per-protocol analysis patient take 80 % prescribed CIFN 80 % prescribed ribavirin 80 % time . Significance : The current initial treatment pegylated interferon alfa ribavirin patient hepatitis C genotype 1 `` difficult-to-treat '' characteristic inadequate . The result trial need demonstrate safety efficacy two regimen daily CIFN ribavirin . Since large majority hepatitis C patient VA community hospital fall category , result trial may influence potential treatment recommend patient .</detailed_description>
