	<detailed_description>1 . STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 1.1 . Objectives The primary objective study evaluate safety effectiveness balloon kyphoplasty treatment painful , acute , VCFs compare standard non-surgical therapy patient cancer . 1.2 . Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint study improvement functional status , measure Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RDQ ) 1 month . The primary hypothesis study mean improvement large subject initially assign management balloon kyphoplasty . Note subject undergo 12 month follow-up initial treatment assignment . 1.3 . Secondary Endpoints The follow secondary endpoint also examine . Comparisons make follow-up visit . Safety : - Rate study treatment-related adverse event - Change neurological status Clinical : - Change functional status assess - Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire - Karnofsky Performance Scale - Change quality life assess SF-36v2™ Health Survey - Change back pain , measure 10-point Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) - Change back-pain analgesic use - Change ambulation status - Changes activity daily live - Time treatment failure Radiographic : - Change spinal deformity , define degree spine angulation assess independent radiologist core laboratory - Rate subsequent vertebral body fracture , assess independent radiologist core lab In case , study hypothesis treatment balloon kyphoplasty result improvement clinical radiographic outcome compare baseline compare non-surgical treatment , preservation outcomes long-term follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . One 3 painful ( pain palpation/percussion fracture vertebral body ) VCF ( ) , T5L5 , either bone marrow edema image magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) fracture image plain radiograph use method Genant 2 . Pain NRS score ≥4 scale 0 10 When patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma , pain assessment must do completion least one pulse steroid therapy one week initiation active multiple myeloma therapy . 3 . Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score ≥ 10 scale 0 24 4 . Patients must least 21 year old . 5 . No change chemotherapy regimen ( change dose ( ) permit ) 1 month prior enrollment 6 . No change chemotherapy regimen ( change dose ( ) permit ) plan least 1 month follow enrollment 7 . No major surgery spine plan least 1 month follow enrollment 8 . Life expectancy ≥ 3 month 9 . Patient sufficient mental capacity comply protocol requirement 10 . Patient state availability study visit 11 . Patient able understand risk benefit participate study willing provide write informed consent . 1 . Patients primary tumor bone ( e.g. , osteosarcoma ) solitary plasmacytoma site index VCF . Patients tumor anatomic site index VCF eligible . 2 . Concurrent Phase I investigational anticancer treatment 3 . Significant clinical morbidity ( aside index fracture ( ) cancer ) may potentially interfere collection data concern pain function 4 . VCF morphology deem unsuitable balloon kyphoplasty 5 . Additional nonkyphoplasty surgical treatment require index fracture 6 . Patients require use highdose steroid ( ≥ 100 mg prednisone 20 mg dexamethasone per day ) , intravenous ( IV ) pain medication , nerve block control chronic back pain unrelated index VCF ( ) . Patients receive highdose steroid treatment cancer ( least 30 day ) eligible . 7 . Patients platelet count &lt; 20,000 measure time hospital admission procedure 8 . Spinal cord compression canal compromise require decompression 9 . Patients osteoblastic tumor site index VCF . Patients osteoblastic tumor outside vertebral level intend kyphoplasty may enrol . 10 . Medical/surgical condition contrary balloon kyphoplasty procedure ( e.g. , presence active incompletely treated local infection ) 11 . Known allergy bone cement contrast medium use treatment study subject 12 . MRI contraindication ( e.g. , cerebral aneurysm clip , pacemaker , implanted biostimulators , cochlear implant , penile prosthesis ) 13 . Positive baseline pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) 14 . Patients may require allogeneic bone marrow transplantation course study . Other Reasons Lack Enrollment : A . Patient afraid surgery B . Patient afraid anesthesia C. Patient/family willing participate research D. Patient willing randomize</criteria>
