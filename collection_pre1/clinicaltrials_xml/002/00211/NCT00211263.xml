	<brief_summary>The Bipolar Disorder Center Pennsylvanians aim reduce significant difference treatment result among Pennsylvanians bipolar disorder , especially among youth , elderly , rural resident , African Americans less likely receive adequate treatment , less likely remain treatment identify , less likely positive result remain treatment . Half subject receive either Guideline Intervention ( GI ) Enhanced Clinical Intervention ( ECI ) . ECI combination information support , education bipolar disorder , medication use treat , information sleep practice habit affect quality sleep , review symptom , medication side effect , cop side effect . It predict Enhanced Clinical Intervention effective reduce difference result risk compare mid-life Caucasians . The treatment study occur three site across Pennsylvania emphasize recruitment African Americans , youth ( age 12 18 ) , adults age 65 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bipolar Disorder Research Study Ages 12 Older</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder one world 's disabling condition , rob sufferer year healthy functioning . The presence bipolar disorder limited nation , race , age , gender , socioeconomic status , lifetime prevalence 1 % across population . While appear disparity risk bipolar disorder , mark disparity likely diagnose treat . The average person bipolar disorder wait ten year receive correct diagnosis ( National Depression Manic-Depression Association , 2000 ) . Once diagnosis bipolar disorder make , equally marked disparity treatment outcome . Also know manic-depressive illness , bipolar disorder recurrent chronic mental condition associate substantial morbidity mortality . The stigma associate open recognition disorder decrease likelihood accurate diagnosis treatment . Considering impact disorder vulnerable population ( youth , elderly , rural population , minority ) , challenge understand reverse current public health crisis . This crisis create enormous financial burden health , welfare , disability system . At time , reduces likelihood economic social productivity achieve potentially productive individual . The primary objective study test intervention reduce health disparity relate bipolar disorder , vastly destructive difficult treat condition previously realize . The outcomes interest include accurate timely diagnosis , adequacy prescribe treatment , retention treatment , suicidality , range treatment benefit include health-related quality life , employment , treatment satisfaction , medication adherence , utilization low level intervention ( e.g. , outpatient versus partial inpatient care ) , reduction substance use , medical morbidity mortality . Particular attention pay collection service utilization data track key health care social service . Costs medical psychiatric treatment , medication , inpatient , rehabilitation , emergency room service ascertain cost assessment , patient ' mood functioning track assess overall effectiveness intervention . The study also use state-of-the-art assessment phenotypic clinical variable develop clinically meaningful predictor treatment response across age spectrum across diverse racial group . To characterize precisely phenotypic complexity disorder , develop spectrum model psychiatric illness use broad conceptualization mood disorder integrate view common comorbidities , anchor Mood Anxiety Spectrum Assessments ( Cassano et al . 1997 ; Cassano et al press ) . This refined description patient variability ( phenotype ) lead improve understanding variability treatment outcome among patient suffer bipolar disorder eventually create appropriate first-line treatment patient present specific clinical phenotype . Careful consideration biological phenotype , represent population pharmacokinetics , turn second line attack problem tailor treatment patient ' specific need . A key correlate treatment response never examine bipolar disorder consistent adequate medication exposure . Essential understanding variability treatment response able distinguish true non-responders never receive adequate exposure drug . Consistency drug exposure determine use combination electronic monitoring drug-taking population pharmacokinetic analysis .</detailed_description>
