	<brief_title>A Study Patients With Pure Red Cell Aplasia Associated With Recombinant Human Erythropoietin Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter ( study conduct multiple site ) , observational ( study investigators/physicians observe participant 's data measure outcomes ) study . Approximately 150 participant enrol study . The study consist initial observation phase extend observation period . An initial observation phase start enrollment end 24 month elapse since date loss efficacy ( LOE ) , supplement retrospective data collection period LOE date date enrollment study . Participants remain epoetin alfa ( EPO-Ab ) positive 24 month LOE enter 2-year extended observation period . Study visit take place every month initial observation phase data collect every 6 month extend observation phase . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , physical examination monitor throughout study . The total study duration participant approximately 4 year .</detailed_description>
