	<brief_summary>Central serous choroidal ( CSC ) retinopathy disease macula characterize exudation fluid retina localize posterior pole well loss vision . The etiology unknown , accord study condition common young male associate type A personality . Clinically , CSC characterize serous retinal detachment area leakage subretinal space . The standard care acute CSC observation period 3 month . If complete resolution retinal detachment 3 month , indication focal laser photocoagulation therapy area leakage . This treatment usually effective stop leakage fluid retina cause resolution detachment . However , laser photocoagulation therapy beneficial treatment chronic CSC single easily identifiable point leakage rather diffuse disease RPE thus render laser treatment ineffective.The purpose medical research study evaluate Verteporfin therapy approach may benefit patient CSC , base observation exudative type AMD patient treat Photodynamic Therapy use Verteporfin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>7.1 Visit 1 - Screening Visit The first visit patient purpose screen patient study . This visit must occur within 1 week prior treatment visit . At visit investigator support staff : 1 . Determine patient eligible enrollment study , explain study patient , obtain informed consent patient . The form witness documented obtain patient 's signature visit . 2 . Only one eye patient enrol study . For patient lesion eye , investigator may enroll eye deem eligible amenable treatment . 3 . Record patient demographic , complete medical history contact information initial visit form . 4 . Perform complete eye examination include : i. visual acuity . ii . slit-lamp biomicroscopy . iii . dilate fundus examination . 5 . Obtain stereo color fundus photograph ( 30 degree field view ) study eye . 6 . Obtain sodium fluorescein angiogram study eye via digital imaging system . 7 . Obtain ICGA study eye . NOTE : If patient present acute illness screen day treatment administration , entry study defer acute illness resolve . 7.2 Visit 2 - Treatment Visit ( Day Zero ) At visit patient assign Verteporfin-PDT laser energy delivery profile accord scheme detailed Section 5.1 , . The investigator support staff : 1 . Perform eye examination include best-corrected visual acuity use EDTRS visual chart . 2 . The angiogram may need repeat previous angiogram do 72 hour ago . 3 . Perform Verteporfin-PDT treatment . NOTE : If patient present acute illness screen day treatment administration , entry study defer till acute illness resolve . 7.3 Visit 3 &amp; 4- First Post-treatment Follow-up Visit The investigator patient return office 2 week ( Visit 3 ) 6 week ( Visit 4 ) perform Verteporfin-PDT treatment . At visit investigator support staff : 1 . Perform complete eye examination include 1. best correct visual acuity use EDTRS visual acuity chart . 2. slit-lamp biomicroscopy . 3. dilate fundus examination . 2 . Obtain stereo color fundus photograph ( 30 degree field view ) study eye . 3 . Obtain sodium fluorescein angiogram study eye via digital imaging system . 4 . Obtain ICGA study eye . 5 . Ask patient new ocular systemic symptom develop since last visit , look associate sign record case report form . 6 . Ask patient record new medication use since last visit . 7 . If patient re-treated post-treatment visit schedule start visit 3 detailed Section 7.3 Visit 3 . 7.4 Visit 5 Visit 12 - Follow-up Visits The investigator patient return office 3-month ( plus/minus 2 week ) interval perform last Verteporfin-PDT treatment . The visit windows continuous , two consecutive visit schedule within 2 week . At visit investigator support staff : 1 . Perform complete eye examination include 1. best correct visual acuity use EDTRS visual acuity chart . 2. slit lamp biomicroscopy . 3. dilate fundus examination . 2 . Obtain stereo color fundus photograph ( 30 degree field view ) study eye . 3 . Obtain sodium fluorescein angiogram study eye . 4 . Obtain ICGA study eye . 5 . Ask patient ocular systemic symptom , look associate sign record case report form . 6 . Ask patient record medication use . 7 . Based eye examination ICGA investigator must decide whether new previously treat CNV vessel need treat . 8 . Perform additional concomitant treatment require . 9 . At final visit ( approximately 24 month entry study ) , patient terminate study .</detailed_description>
