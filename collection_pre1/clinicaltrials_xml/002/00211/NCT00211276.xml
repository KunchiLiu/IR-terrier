	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find study drug , ONTAK ( denileukin diftitox ) , shrink slow growth B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) patient whose disease respond prior treatment , relapse initial response prior treatment . The safety treatment ONTAK also study . The hypothesis patient relapse refractory B-cell NHL mild moderate myelosuppression treat ONTAK new dose regimen respond sufficiently warrant study .</brief_summary>

Acceptable organ function define follow : Bilirubin &lt; equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) SGOT ( AST ) SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; equal 2 time ULN . Serum creatinine &lt; 2 time ULN . Serum albumin &gt; equal 3.0 g/dL Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within seven day prior study drug administration , must agree use effective mean contraception throughout study . Life expectancy least 16 week . Patients must review , sign date witnessed informed consent document approve IRB participate center . Less 6 month prior allogeneic stem cell transplant and/or patient active graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) Grade &gt; equal 2 . Prior history venoocclusive disease liver . Inability comply protocol requirement study intravenous administration ONTAK . Pregnant woman lactate woman breastfeed woman plan become pregnant treatment period . Serious intercurrent medical illness active infection , investigator opinion , might interfere interpretation study safety data compromise patient ability carry treatment program . Known history seropositivity HIV chronic hepatitis ( test HIV require ) . Known hypersensitivity ONTAK component : diptheria toxin , interleukin2 excipients . Experimental therapy within 4 week prior study entry . Patients diagnose congestive heart failure , NYHA Class III IV , ventricular tachycardia , fibrillation , history myocardial infarction 12 month prior study entry . Any prior radiation therapy within four week enrollment , prior radiation therapy site evaluable disease unless disease progression occur site . Patients concurrent corticosteroid treatment NHL . The use taper dos low dos corticosteroid resolve GVHD , use corticosteroid premedication prior ONTAK transient treatment hypersensitivity reaction permit necessary . History prior malignancy within precede 5 year , except successfully treat cervical carcinoma situ basal cell carcinoma .</criteria>
