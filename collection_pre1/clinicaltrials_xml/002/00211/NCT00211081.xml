	<brief_summary>Ultrasound technique provide image blood vessel artery . The size artery , main blood vessel arm , change different condition . Using ultrasound see artery change movement even drug . We want use ultrasound see blood vessel look patient Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) also see drug call Spironolactone , commonly prescribed patient disease , effect blood vessel function patient congestive heart failure . This information may use change standard care patient heart failure especially show Spironolactone positive effect vessel function patient CHF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spironolactone The start dose spironolactone 1 mg/kg/day . After two week dose double maximum dose ( 2/mg/kg/day ) RALES . If side effect occur plasma urea electrolyte become deranged dose halve . Patients unable tolerate minimum dose withdrawn . Measurement serum electrolytes occur baseline , two week , time repeat evaluation . Endothelial Function Subjects single ventricle evaluation endothelial function : 1 . At baseline 2 . On spironolactone- 4-5 week initial study . Imaging protocol : The diameter brachial artery measure two-dimensional ultrasound image , use 12 MHz linear array transducer Accuson Sequoia system ( Accuson , Mountainview , California ) . Measurements brachial artery obtain : 1 . In rest state 2 . During limb ischemia 3 . In response reactive hyperemia 4 . At rest Reactive hyperemia induce inflate standard blood pressure cuff 50 mm Hg systolic blood pressure 4.5 minute deflate cuff . After data collection , DICOM-formatted image transfer PC investigator-blinded measurement brachial artery diameter use image analysis software ( Brachial Tools 3.1 , Medical Imaging Applications , Iowa ) . Measurement prognostic marker : Blood sample Plasma beta-type natriuretic peptide , form assay , TNF alpha Cytokine panel drawn base line final 4-5 week visit study . Samples collect 11 1 pm 30 minute ' supine rest . The sample centrifuge plasma store -70°C ( peptide ) -20°C ( sample ) . Plasma [ beta ] -type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) sample collect EDTA aprotonin measure radioimmunoassay 6-minute walk test . A 6-minute walk test perform first visit last visit . During test , sign symptom record ( i.e . chest pain shortness breath ) determine toleration daily activity . A doctor nurse conduct test patient provide opportunity stop rest symptoms become severe . Outcome measure The primary outcome measure change flow mediate dilation ( reactive hyperemia ) . This expressed percentage . Secondary outcome measure include change BNP , Form assay , TNF alpha , Cytokine panel 6-minute walk test . Statistical analysis We others previously show asymptomatic patient Fontan operation mean flow-mediated dilation approximately 4 % compare 8-9 % control . In order detect 25 % change FMD , power 0.80 , current study would require patient population 13 case . There currently 40 patient single ventricle follow adult congenital clinic Emory University . We plan enrol 20 patient study .</detailed_description>
