	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Heart Failure ( HF ) one lead cause hospitalization Canada . While great advance make treatment disease , factor limit effectiveness treatment include : poor compliance dietary guideline medication , patient ' lack understanding impact disease , lack understanding impact lifestyle habit disease lack systematic monitoring patient follow hospitalization . The objective trial education compliance heart failure patient ( TEACH ) measure patient heart failure hospitalize discharge community , impact comprehensive outpatient educational intervention : 1. composite endpoint mortality , readmission visit emergency room cause , 2. impact intervention health-related quality life , 3. impact intervention compliance medication 4. economic impact provide intervention patient . A unique component study participation community pharmacists part seamless care model economic qualitative evaluation educational intervention . RESEARCH DESIGN : This prospective , randomize control clinical trial patient admit hospital diagnosis heart failure . Patients stratify reason admission hospital . Stratum 1 include patient whose primary reason admission HF stratum 2 include patient whose primary reason hospital admission HF . The randomization follow cluster randomization design community pharmacy randomize deliver either intervention ( INTERVENTION ) usual care ( CONTROL ) . Patients assign one two arm contingent upon pharmacy obtain medication . All patient receive standardize in-hospital education previously validate ( Eur J HF , press 2003 ) . This education consist educational booklet videos HF , health promotion dietary information well relevant intervention community pharmacist aim help patient become compliant medication provide framework understanding help persistence . HYPOTHESIS : HF patient receive enhance educational intervention community pharmacist : 1. absolute risk reduction number event 20 % , 2. compliant , 3. demonstrate less health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) impairment measure disease-specific generic HRQoL instrument 4. low costs/quality adjust life year ( QALY ) due few total event per patient . OUTCOMES : Outcomes collect every 3 month baseline end one year . Events track use comprehensive database develop validate . Further utilization data provide ICES data linkage facility patient interview time outcome assessment . In order measure compliance continue use electronic measure know Track Caps ( MEMS ) . The indirect measure pharmacy refill data provide u community pharmacy patient us . This data interpret use validated formula develop Steiner et al . ( 1996 ) . Resource use clinical outcome also collect . IMPORTANCE : Medication use treat HF chronic disease work , use . We provide validated education intervention patient exist community infrastructure aim reduce morbidity mortality positive impact HRQoL within cost-effective framework .</detailed_description>
