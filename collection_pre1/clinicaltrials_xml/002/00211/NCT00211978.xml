	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine calcium acetate ( PhosLo ) control serum phosphorus pre-dialysis patient moderate severe impairment kidney function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EPIC ( Effect PhosLo Phosphorus Levels Chronic Kidney Disease )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient impaired kidney function , dietary phosphorus completely excrete , lead elevated level serum phosphorus . Elevated serum phosphorus lead increase level parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , associate bone disease adverse consequence soft-tissue vascular calcification , increase morbidity mortality . It therefore important prevent hyperphosphatemia maintain serum phosphorus level within range recommend K/DOQI . In patient dialysis , phosphate binder routinely use control serum phosphorus absorb dietary phosphate transit intestine . However , use phosphate binder non-dialyzed patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) FDA approve indication , although physician treat patient prior dialysis base clinical judgment . The goal study demonstrate efficacy calcium acetate ( PhosLo ) control serum phosphorus patient moderate severe decrease kidney function .</detailed_description>
