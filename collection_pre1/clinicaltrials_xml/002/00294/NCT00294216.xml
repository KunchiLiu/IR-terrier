	<detailed_description>There evidence epidemiological study large clinical trial consumption long-chain Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) find oily fish fish oil , protect cardiovascular disease Western Populations . The large clinical trial GISSI-Prevention show radical reduction Cardiovascular Disease Sudden Cardiac Death intake Omega-3 PUFA , statistically significant effect see month use . One model explain markedly effect hypothesize Omega-3 PUFA , anti inflammatory effect , might act stabilize atherosclerotic plaque decrease infiltration inflammatory cell plaque and/or decrease activity cell resident plaque . A previous clinical study show increased incorporation Omega-3 fatty acid EPA DHA carotid plaque intake Omega-3 PUFA . The morphological property plaque also alter , show thicker fibrous cap le inflammation determine AHA modify AHA classification . These finding important confirm . Secondly additional indicator plaque stability require strengthen hypothesis . Also mechanisms morphological change come need identify . The model use assess structural change associate plaque rupture instability different important variable . Comparisons : Double blind comparison Omacor 2g/day placebo patient await endarterectomy .</detailed_description>
