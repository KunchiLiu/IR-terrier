	<detailed_description>COPD increase cause death morbidity smoke primary cause . Professional smoking cessation treatment cost-effective therefore recommend national guideline . A controlled study demonstrate smoke cessation protocol routine primary care , specifically targeted patient COPD ( SMOCC ) , double quit rate . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) Euro 1012 show protocol cost-effective . The protocol test optimal trial condition , unclear large-scale implementation strategy ( cost- ) effective . Therefore present study investigates implementation strategy 2-armed community intervention trial . General practice ( N=150 , 2700 smoking patient COPD ) randomly allocate intervention control condition . In control condition usual dissemination strategy distribute guideline subsequent product professional channel ( journal , postgraduate education ) take place . In intervention condition multifaceted implementation strategy wil execute aim support general practice team ( outreach education facilitator , support detect smoking patient COPD , provision patient education material , help desk/website , telephone e-mail reminder ) . The research question ( cost- ) effective implementation strategy compare usual implementation procedure . Primary outcome measure biochemically validate smoke abstinence 12 18 month . Secondary outcome measure counsel contact counsel behaviour professional cessation attempt patient . A process analysis evaluation patient professional integral part study . A cost-effectiveness analysis take health care sector perspective perform show expect cost per practice incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) . The study last 34 month , intervention period take 18 month per practice .</detailed_description>
