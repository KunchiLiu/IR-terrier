	<brief_summary>This study Phase 2/3 , multicenter , double-blind , randomize , parallel-group , placebo-controlled , dose-finding trial Serostim® ( mammalian cell-derived recombinant human growth hormone , r-hGH ) versus placebo subject human immunodeficiency virus-associated adipose tissue redistribution syndrome ( HARS ) . The primary study objective determine whether Serostim® treatment reduces adipose tissue maldistribution effectively placebo . The primary co-endpoints derive measure visceral adipose tissue assess computerized tomography ( CT ) ratio trunk ; limb fat assessed dual-energy X-Ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan . Anthropometric measure , physical exam , quality life assessment , serial photograph , various laboratory measure use address secondary objective . These secondary objective relate impact Serostim® Physician subject assessment change body shape , health-related quality life , attitude towards medication compliance , metabolic marker , fat redistribution , safety . On Day 1 , eligible subject randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive daily Serostim® , Serostim® placebo give alternate day , daily placebo . Serostim® dose base body weight , maximum dose 4 milligram ( mg ) . Therapy continue 12 week . Treatment alter new treatment continue Week 24 . Interim Study Visits require Weeks 2 4 ( Treatment Period 1 ) Weeks 14 16 ( Treatment Period 2 ) . Subjects offer enrolled maintenance Protocol ( Study 23056 ) Week 24 .</brief_summary>
