	<detailed_description>The question routine membrane sweep prelabor rupture membrane specifically address randomize control trial . A meta analysis membrane sweep find ten publication analyze question secondary outcome , though none study seek analyze PROM objective . This meta analysis find relative risk prelabor rupture membranes 1.14 membrane sweeping , however confidence interval 0.89 1.45 make find significant . Despite , feel study specifically address issue warrant . The large study meta analysis ( one statistically significant difference ) find significant risk PROM . The study meta analysis vary greatly incidence PROM , range 2-39 % membrane sweep group 2-26 % control group . This wide variation , fact study primarily design compare PROM rate , report 8-10 % PROM text study give question ability meta analysis detect difference PROM rate two group . As effect membrane sweep PROM may influence clinician attitude toward intervention , specific research warrant . Our Objective : 1 . To determine rate prelabor rupture membrane uncomplicated term pregnancy undergo routine membrane sweep versus without intervention . For purpose study , PROM define confirmation rupture amniotic fluid uterine contraction less 10 minute apart . 2 . To determine impact membrane sweep successful labor induction post datism pregnancy go past 41 week 3 . To determine impact membrane sweep PROM clinical variable Patients randomize computer generate randomizer either receive membrane sweep vaginal exam without membrane sweeping . Patients receive either membrane sweep vaginal exam without membrane sweep weekly visit 38 week gestation onwards . Patients intervention group receive cervical evaluation unless clinically indicate . Patients membrane sweeping group finger place cervical o , finger rotate 360 degree fashion separate amniotic membrane circular motion . Patients group whose cervix open enough membrane sweep gently stretch cervix close gently massage stimulate release prostaglandin ( 1 ) . Due nature intervention , possible blind physician perform vaginal exam group patient . However , admit deliver physician blind group allocation . This minimize bias . Such blind do patient identifier code chart clinic physician use access randomizer online determination exam perform . Admitting deliver physician access code . Between 38 42 week gestation , clinical data prenatal visit keep include patient age , gestational age , parity , race , cervical exam , post-graduate year level physician provider midwife attend staff , whether membrane sweeping perform . In Labor Delivery data collect gestational age delivery , indication admission , induction , reason induction , estimate gestational age delivery , PROM , cervical exam admission , Bishop ’ score admission , labor outcome , route delivery , pregnancy complication , neonatal complication , GBS status , NICU admission . PROM indication admission confirm nitrazine testing , ferning test , speculum examination . Two three test must indicate PROM patient give diagnosis PROM . PROM define positive testing contraction 10 minute apart time rupture membrane . If PROM occur prior examination , assessment make tocometer . If PROM occur prior patient present Labor Delivery , assessment base patient ’ subjective assessment contraction time membrane rupture . Labor define regular contraction lead cervical change . The frequency contraction require cause cervical change varies patient patient , however purpose study patient consider SROM ( spontaneous rupture membrane due labor ) contraction frequent every 10 minute . Patients analyzed intent treat basis .</detailed_description>
