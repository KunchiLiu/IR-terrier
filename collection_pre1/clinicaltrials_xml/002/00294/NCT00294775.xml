	<brief_title>Effect Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers ( ARB ) Left Ventricular Reverse Remodelling After Aortic Valve Replacement Severe Valvular Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background : Aortic valve stenosis ( AVS ) common valvular disease western world . The prevalence increase age `` degenerative '' change aortic valve thickening , accumulation calcium progressive dysfunction valve usually become apparent patient older 60 year . Although development AVS generally believe degenerative process recent study demonstrate AVS cause complex process increase cellularity , lipid accumulation , extracellular matrix deposition , disease progression calcification lesion . Although mild moderate AVS generally well tolerate severe AVS associate considerable morbidity mortality , valve replacement generally require . The consequence AVS increase pressure load leave ventricle cause change ventricular structure . Pressure overload cause replication sarcomere lead leave ventricular ( LV ) hypertrophy , myocardial stretch cause activation cardiac peptide activation renin angiotensin aldosterone system ( RAAS ) . With progression disease , RAAS activation , stimulation angiotensin-II receptor mediate fibroblast proliferation , promote fibrosis directly affect extracellular matrix . The consequence LV hypertrophy interstitial fibrosis increase chamber-stiffness delayed active LV relaxation initially cause diastolic ( increased LV end-diastolic pressure ) later disease progression also systolic dysfunction . In congestive heart failure ischemic heart disease degree diastolic dysfunction demonstrate correlate functional class , neurohormonal activation prognosis also recently suggest AVS . Thus , although fully elucidate transition well compensate hypertrophy cause pressure overload symptomatic heart failure may relate evolve diastolic dysfunction . With longstanding elevated filling pressure leave atrium dilate due chronically increased atrial afterload . Only limited data available degree importance LA dilatation AVS . When apparent , symptoms heart failure AVS associate high mortality rate . If LV systolic dysfunction also present prognosis deteriorate . In case aorta valve replacement ( AVR ) recommend . AVR normalize pressure overload thereby decrease LV hypertrophy . Previously believe time LV hypertrophy regress towards normal even normalize . More recent study however demonstrate LV hypertrophy regression mainly happen first 12-18 month AVR , little subsequent change see remain 10 year . Furthermore , patient experience regression hypertrophy favourable outcome well functional class patient le regression hypertrophy . Thus absence reverse remodelling associate poor outcome AVR . Importantly regression LV hypertrophy closely parallel decrease RAAS hyperactivity . RAAS hyperactivity may attenuate pharmacologically use angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEi ) angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) systemic hypertension LV hypertrophy associate reverse remodelling . This may least partly associate increased collagenase activity depress collagen synthesis . Thus attenuation RAAS hyperactivity may theory lead decrease myocardial fibrosis improve diastolic function LV . The effect ARB treatment patient AVS undergone AVR known . 2 . Hypothesis : In patient undergo AVR symptomatic valvular aortic stenosis , 12 month post operative blockade angiotensin II receptor accelerate LV LA reverse remodelling , reduce fill pressure suppress neurohormonal activation compare conventional therapy . This lead improve exercise tolerance due improve left atrial function reduce risk atrial arrythmias . 3 . Specific Objectives : 3.1 Primary Objectives - In consecutive population undergo AVR symptomatic AVS compare 1 . LV mass index 2 . LA volume index 3 . Plasma nt-pro BNP concentration 12 month treatment candesartan compare conventional treatment 3.2 Secondary Objectives - In consecutive population undergo AVR symptomatic AVS compare 1 . Diastolic E/e ' ratio 2 . Overall LV function assess Doppler echocardiographic Tei Index 3 . Regional LV function assess tissue Doppler image 4 . LV end systolic end diastolic volume index 12 month treatment candesartan compare conventional treatment . 3.3 Tertiary Objectives - In consecutive population undergo AVR symptomatic AVS compare occurrence atrial arrhythmia assess 48h Holter 12 month treatment candesartan compare conventional management . - In consecutive population undergo AVR symptomatic AVS compare exercise capacity 12 month treatment candesartan compare conventional management . - In consecutive population undergo AVR symptomatic AVS ass serial change LV diastolic , overall LV function regional LV systolic function 12 month valve replacement - In consecutive population undergo AVR symptomatic AVS ass serial change plasma nt-pro BNP , ANP , renin 12 month valve replacement . 4 . Methods : 4.1 Design The study prospective single center randomize study ( PROBE design ) . Eligible patient randomize either conventional management conventional management 12 month treatment candesartan . Treatment candesartan unblinded neurohormonal analysis analyse LV LA size function perform blinded treatment allocation clinical data . 4.4 Study Procedures Patients schedule elective aortic valve replacement severe AVS Odense University Hospital consecutively offer participation study hospital admission ( 2 day prior surgery ) . If patient consent obtain patient undergo study program . Baseline echocardiography , neurohormonal analysis , 6 min walk test perform day surgery . After surgery patient transfer cardiac intensive care unit step unit treatment candesartan ( AtacandÂ® ) 8 mg daily initiate , hospitalization patient titrate 32 mg. After hospital discharge patient follow heart failure clinic Odense University Hospital . Study medication hand patient visit . Enrollment plan start February 2006 continue 18 month 140 patient enrol . 4.4.1 Echocardiography Doppler echocardiography perform prior valve replacement , repeat 3 , 6 , 12 month surgery . Examinations perform GE medical Vivid 5 ultrasound machine . Images obtain parasternal apical window . M-mode recording do parasternal long-axis view . Pulsed Doppler measurement mitral inflow obtain transducer apical four-chamber view , 1-2 mm Doppler sample volume place tip mitral leaflet diastole . Tissue Doppler image mitral annulus obtain apical 4-chamber view 1.5-mm sample volume place medial mitral annulus . All Doppler echocardiographic examination do horizontal sweep set 100 mm/s . At least 3-5 cardiac cycle measure . Finally color cod real time tissue Doppler image acquire apical window . - End-systolic , end-diastolic volume ejection fraction calculate accord Simpson modify biplane method . - LV mass estimate use recommendation American Society Echocardiography . - Maximal left atrial volume measure end-systole use two orthogonal apical view . - From pulse wave mitral inflow signal , peak E wave velocity , peak A wave velocity , mitral E-wave deceleration time measure . From pulse wave Doppler record LV outflow ejection time record . From recording Tei index assess . - From peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity size inferior v. cava pulmonary arterial systolic pressure estimate . - From tissue Doppler assessment medial mitral annulus early ( E ' ) diastolic velocity record . Diastolic function grade grade 0-3 diastolic E/e ' ratio calculate . - From color cod tissue Doppler image systolic longitudinal fibre shorten assess use tissue tracking , systolic strain assess regional basis . 4.4.2 Neurohormonal Analyses Prior surgery follow-up visit venous blood sample draw analysis plasma N-terminal proBNP , plasma N-terminal ANP concentration . In addition prior surgery 6 12 month treatment candesartan RAAS activity assess use plasma-renin activity , plasma-aldosterone , plasma-noradrenalin . In addition plasma frozen visit possible later analysis . 4.4.3 Six Minutes Walk Test A 6 min . walk test perform baseline outpatient visit ( 3 , 6 , 9 12 month ) . 4.4.3 Holter Monitoring At 12 month visit 2-channel 48 hour Holter monitoring perform analyzed occurrence atrial arrhythmia . 4.4.4 Blood Pressure Measurement blood pressure do standardize 30 min rest visit . Target blood pressure 140/80 mmHg le treatment instituted appropriate . 4.4.5 Study Events During study period hospitalization worsen heart failure , fatal / nonfatal stroke , fatal/nonfatal acute coronary syndrome , hospitalization atrial arrhythmia , death cause record .</detailed_description>
