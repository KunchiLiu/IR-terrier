	<brief_summary>The Children Liver Disease Research Education Network ( ChiLDREN ) conduct clinical trial evaluate whether long-term treatment corticosteroid improve outcome Kasai gall-bladder Kasai infant biliary atresia . In clinical trial , ChiLDREN test whether corticosteroid therapy follow Kasai improve bile drainage long term outcome infant biliary atresia . Subjects trial must start treatment within 72 hour Kasai procedure part prospective study natural history biliary atresia also conduct ChiLDREN ( http : //www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00061828 ? order=3 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double-Blinded , Placebo-Controlled Trial Corticosteroid Therapy Following Portoenterostomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial prospectively determine efficacy corticosteroid outcome infant biliary atresia . The trial conduct NIDDK-funded network 15 clinical center comprise Biliary Children Liver Disease Research Education Network ( ChiLDREN ) , whose goal study etiology , pathogenesis , diagnosis , treatment infant biliary atresia . For trial , overall hypothesis therapy corticosteroid follow portoenterostomy ( include gall bladder Kasai procedure ) improve bile drainage long-term outcome infant biliary atresia . This hypothesis test follow specific aim hypothesis : Aim 1 : To determine whether corticosteroid therapy decrease serum bilirubin concentration portoenterostomy . Aim 2 : To determine whether corticosteroid treatment portoenterostomy improve outcome define survival without transplantation 24 month age . Aim 3 : To determine whether corticosteroid treatment portoenterostomy improve growth infant biliary atresia . Aim 4 : To determine whether corticosteroid treatment improve biochemical indicator fat-soluble vitamin supplementation standard dos . Aim 5 : To determine whether corticosteroid treatment portoenterostomy decrease incidence persistent ascites ascites require medical treatment . The significance propose trial determine whether corticosteroid effective medical treatment improve bile drainage long-term outcome , whether use reduces need liver transplantation infant biliary atresia . Subjects recruit patient enrolled ChiLDREN prospective observational database study undergo portoenterostomy portochelecystostomy ( gall bladder Kasai ) biliary atresia . The Primary outcome measure percentage patient serum total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL native liver 6 month portoenterostomy . Secondary outcome measure : 1 . Serum total bilirubin concentration ( also 3 month portoenterostomy ) 2 . Survival native liver 24 month age 3 . Growth 1 . Weight age Z-score ( patient without ascites ) 2 . Height age Z score 4 . Serum biomarkers sufficiency fat-soluble vitamin 1 . Vitamin A : molar ratio serum retinol/retinol bind protein 2 . Vitamin D : serum level 25-hydroxy vitamin D 3 . Vitamin E : ratio serum vitamin E/total lipids 4 . Vitamin K : International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) 5 . Presence ascites All measurement make 12 24 month age ( unless note otherwise ) :</detailed_description>
