	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose drug lenalidomide ( Revlimid , lenalidomide ) give RituxanÂ® ( rituximab ) treatment relapse mantle cell lymphoma . The safety effectiveness combination treatment also study mantle cell lymphoma diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , transform large cell lymphoma , and/or Grade 3 follicular lymphoma ( follicular cleave large cell lymphoma follicular non-cleaved large cell lymphoma ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Rituximab Treatment Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma ( MCL ) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rituximab type drug know monoclonal antibody . It design act cluster differentiation antigen 20 ( CD20 ) antigen find surface normal B lymphocytes malignant lymphoma cell . When rituximab attack CD20 antigen , kill lymphoma cell . lenalidomide known immunomodulatory drug . It think work help immune system fight disease . If find eligible , receive lenalidomide plus rituximab . This study do 2 phase . In Phase I portion study , 6 dose level lenalidomide study . The level rituximab give participant . Between 3-6 participant treat dose level . Those enrol first study receive low dose lenalidomide plus rituximab . After treatment , dose level lenalidomide evaluate check intolerable side effect . The dose lenalidomide receive depend time enter study side effect participant enter study . Once dose assign , increase , could decrease remain intolerable side effect . Once high tolerable dose lenalidomide find , additional participant receive dose Phase II portion study . You swallow lenalidomide capsule whole mouth every day time , glass water either full empty stomach . Do break , chew open capsule . This continue 21 day , follow 7-day rest period . Each 28-day period call cycle therapy . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . During Cycle 1 , also take rituximab vein week 4 week ( total 4 dos ) . The first rituximab infusion ( vein ) usually take 6 8 hour . Later infusion generally short , take 4 hour complete . For participant large mass lymphoma cell blood , rituximab dose may split 2-day infusion . Vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure , respiration , heart rate ) monitor , , infusion . There observation period 1 hour end rituximab infusion , allow go home . You give diary record take study medication problem illness experience . You also write diary medication take study . After begin treatment study drug , check-up visit weekly first cycle , every 2 week Cycles 2 3 therapy , month rest study . If doctor feel necessary , check-up visit may take place often . At end 28-day treatment cycle , visit study doctor see safe continue study make sure cancer gotten bad . If end cycle , doctor believe eligible continue ( base degree type side effect response cancer study drug ) , receive enough study drug another 28-day treatment cycle . At visit complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You ask question felt since last visit . All medication take since last visit review study doctor . You bring empty pill package unused medication along diary give earlier visit . You blood sample collect ( around 8 tablespoon ) routine blood test check status disease . If eligible continue study , new 28-day supply lenalidomide capsule give visit . Other test may do visit check status disease . You may sample bone marrow collect and/or either x-rays CT scan , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan ( need ) , gastrointestinal endoscopy ( patient know suspected site disease ) evaluate response therapy . These test may do every check-up visit . They do doctor feel necessary . You may unscheduled visit time study doctor feel necessary care . You may continue receive treatment long cancer get bad experience intolerable side effect . If , time treatment , disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study , doctor discus treatment option . The number week study drug depend well tolerating study drug well lymphoma responds study drug . After participation study end , complete cycle 1 , end-of-study visit . At visit complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . You ECG asked question felt since last visit . All medication take since last visit review study doctor . You blood sample collect ( around 3 tablespoon ) routine blood test check status disease . You bone marrow collect test either x-rays CT scan body check status disease . You return empty drug packaging well unused lenalidomide capsule visit . If complete least 12 24 cycle treatment lenalidomide , follow-up visit every 3 month . If complete 24 cycle treatment lenalidomide , follow-up visit every 6 month . This continue disease get bad . At visit , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test thyroid function . The status disease evaluate may bone marrow biopsy aspirate . You chest x-ray CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis . If need , also CT scan neck . If need , colonoscopy endoscopy . You may also bone marrow biopsy aspirate perform . After end-of-study visit , contact phone every 6 month March 15 , 2015 , check health information cancer treatment may receive . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available . Lenalidomide approve treatment patient transfusion-dependent anemia due Low- Intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome associate chromosome 5 abnormality without chromosome abnormality . Lenalidomide also approve combination dexamethasone treatment patient multiple myeloma receive least one prior therapy . Its use study , relapse mantle cell lymphoma large B-cell Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , investigational . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider experimental . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Up 71 participant mantle cell lymphoma 41 participant diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , transform large cell lymphoma , and/or Grade 3 follicular lymphoma ( follicular cleave large cell lymphoma follicular non-cleaved large cell lymphoma ) take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
