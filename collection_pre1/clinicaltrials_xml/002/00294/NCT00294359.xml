	<brief_summary>Although possible cure bowel cancer detect early stage , many case may spread involve organ case generally incurable . Chemotherapy prolongs survival improve quality life patient , standard chemotherapy disease define . There several possible chemotherapy treatment patient bowel cancer , spread organ . However , treatment partly effective work limited period time . Most treatment associate number possible side effect may detrimental effect quality life . Thus , imperative effective treatment low possible risk side effect develop . Previous study show addition new type antibody treatment ( bevacizumab ) intensive combination chemotherapy regimen improve survival patient advance bowel cancer extend time tumour begin grow . However , intensive chemotherapy likely suitable treatment proportion patient bowel cancer , intensive chemotherapy cause high rate side effect . This study compare gentle chemotherapy treatment ( capecitabine chemotherapy tablet give mouth ) combination capecitabine bevacizumab combination capecitabine , bevacizumab intravenous mitomycin C. It expect gentle chemotherapy treatment gentle chemotherapy treatment combine bevacizumab would appropriate treatment young fit patient well old less fit patient would easily tolerate intensive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The MAX Study : Mitomycin C , Avastin Xeloda Patients With Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims - The phase II stage study aim determine relative toxicity combination capecitabine bevacizumab combination capecitabine , mitomycin C ( MMC ) bevacizumab capecitabine monotherapy ass tumour response rate ( RECIST criterion ) arm For Phase III stage primary objective compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) three arm . Secondary objective determine treatment related toxicity ; determine tumour response rate ( RECIST criterion ) ; determine overall survival treatment arm ; compare disease relate symptom Quality life determine cost effectiveness bevacizumab contain treatment . Research Plan Synopsis - Trial Design : Randomised , stratify multicentre phase II/III study . The study proceed 2 phase , initially randomise phase II stage evaluate safety 60 patient ( approx 20 per arm ) 150 patient ( approx 50 per arm ) complete least 6 week ' treatment . This continue randomise phase III stage evaluate activity , toxicity quality life measure . Treatments : Patients randomise treatment either one three arm : I ) Capecitabine monotherapy ; 2 ) Capecitabine bevacizumab ; 3 ) Capecitabine bevacizumab MMC . Drug administration : Arm 1 : Capecitabine 2500mg/m2/d ( 2 divide dos ) d1-14 q3weekly . Arm 2 : Capecitabine administer per Arm 1 plus Bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg q3weekly . Arm 3 : Capecitabine Bevacizumab administer per Arm 2 plus Mitomycin C 7 mg/m2 q 6weekly ( maximum dose 14 mg , maximum 4 treatment ) . Analysis : A total sample size 333 patient ( 111 per group ) require detect improvement least 3.1 month progression free survival 5.5 8.6 month use 2-tailed comparison , 2.5 % level significance , 3-year accrual 1-year follow-up . The 12-month survival rate patient capecitabine alone 50 % . A sample size 111 per arm 80 % power detect increase 17 % 1-year rate 50 % 67 % base significance level 2.5 % , 3-year accrual 1-year follow-up . For endpoint ( PFS survival ) difference capecitabine alone regimen contain MMC expect great ( order 4.5 month ) yield &gt; 80 % power detect difference PFS . Whilst primary comparison , study nevertheless still 80 % power detect 5.5 month difference two experimental arm secondary comparison base level significance 1.7 % . Secondary endpoint include treatment related toxicity . Toxicity analyse include treatment-received population , include patient receive least 1 dose study treatment . Toxicity describe tabulate proportion patient worst toxicity grade 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 relevant NCI CTC AE scale . Phase II : Confidence interval difference incidence bevacizumab MMC associate grade 3/4 toxicity three arm calculate . If incidence toxicity triple combination regimen ( Capecitabine/MMC/ bevacizumab ) exceed rate toxicity experience capecitabine/bevacizumab combination 20 % consideration give dose adjustment stop recruitment triple combination arm . Phase III : The PFS capecitabine chemotherapy alone expect 5.5 month expect increase 9 month addition bevacizumab , consider clinically meaningful . Using overall 95 % confidence level 80 % power 2.5 % significance level comparison 111 patient per arm require detect difference base 36-month accrual 12-month follow-up . Outcomes Significance - This randomised phase II/III study aim compare capecitabine monotherapy capecitabine plus bevacizumab capecitabine plus bevacizumab plus MMC patient previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer . The use either MMC bevacizumab 5FU base chemotherapy appear result improve activity without substantial increase toxicity . Thus regimens incorporate agent could significant activity well tolerate . These regimen could suitable low toxicity palliative regimen broad range population patient metastatic colorectal cancer include old patient co-morbidities . As anticipated rate acute toxicity regimen low observe oxaliplatin CPT-11-based regimen , target population may broad range study . Thus , may include old patient , patient limit performance status ( PS2 ) , patient co-morbidities patient concern relate toxicity oxaliplatin CPT-11-based combination chemotherapy . However , restrict population younger , fitter patient may also enrol study low rate side effect likely associate improve quality life .</detailed_description>
