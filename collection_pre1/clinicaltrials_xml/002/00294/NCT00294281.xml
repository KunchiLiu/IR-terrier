	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) long-term disorder characterize widespread body pain tender point joint , muscle , tendon , soft tissue . Other symptom associate disorder include fatigue depression . The cause FMS unknown , conventional treatment often unsuccessful adequately relieve pain . For people severe , unrelenting pain , refer refractory FMS , opioid maintenance therapy may option , come dangerous potential addiction therefore avoid possible . Vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS ) , nerve locate neck receive electrical input , may option provide pain relief . The purpose study determine safety , tolerability , effectiveness VNS treatment people refractory FMS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vagus Nerve Stimulation Treating Adults With Severe Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FMS affect 5 % general population occur often woman age 20 50 year old . Overall , 80 % FMS patient report pain primary symptom limit ability work , 30 % patient disable , 45 % collect Social Security Disability insurance . Conventional treatment , include pharmacological behavioral intervention , fail provide adequate pain relief half FMS patient , strongly suggest need improve treatment option . One option treatment call vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS ) , short burst electrical energy direct brain way vagus nerve . The vagus nerve cranial nerve originates brainstem , travel neck , continue thorax abdomen . The nerve act sensory motor nerve , regulate several brain area involve pain emotional processing . With VNS , small battery device surgically implanted skin , usually chest , provide necessary electrical energy stimulation . Although VNS FDA approve form epilepsy depression , yet receive FDA approval FMS . Also , unknown whether safety tolerability profile FMS patient receive VNS patient epilepsy depression receive VNS . The purpose study determine safety , tolerability , effectiveness VNS treatment option adult refractory FMS . Participants study 25 month . An initial screening period may last 6 week include medical history review , various examination , use wrist-mounted device call Actiwatch record pain severity mood seven consecutive day . Eligible participant undergo surgical implantation VNS system . This follow 2-week recovery period , 2-week period gradually increase electrical output VNS system , finally 12-week VNS treatment period electrical output level remain constant , unless participant develops intolerable side effect . Study visit occur weekly first month implantation every 2 week treatment period . During study visit , participant undergo clinical assessment , include evaluation side effect , complete write assessment pain , mood , fatigue , quality life sleep . The VNS system also check safety program appropriately . During Week 16 visit , screen evaluation repeat . Also Week 16 , mark end treatment period , participant option continue receive treatment . All participant follow-up evaluation Months 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 . Participants wish retain VNS implantation beyond length study refer qualified neurologist follow-up care . For participant , VNS system turn surgically explanted .</detailed_description>
