	<brief_summary>The purpose study test hypothesis use three different technique anastomose coronary graft aorta : partial occlusion , single cross clamp , use Heartstring anastomotic device , change amount gas solid microemboli detect EmbodopR transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) system consequently neurocognitive performance patient coronary bypass operation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TCD Detection Gas Solid Micro-Emboli Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ( CABG ) : The Influence Proximal Anastomosis Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It uncommon cardiac surgical patient heart fix brain damage . Sometimes damage overt manifest major neurological deficiency . The frequency stroke , call type 1 damage , report 1 4 percent . This may increase mortality 1.4 % 22 % hospitalization 6.6 day 17.5 day . Diffuse encephalopathy , present delirium , confusion , coma seizure , call type 2 damage , report appear much high frequency 3 % 7 % , depend time method evaluation . This type damage increase mortality 1.4 % 7.5 % hospitalization 6.6 % 15.2 % . Sometimes subtle appear neurocognitive decline . This type damage may find 53 % patient discharge , 24 % six month frequency rise 42 % five year . The impact patient family might devastate burden medical system society enormous . Long term , moderate severe disability may affect 69 % stroke patient survival may decline 67 % one year . After year research effort become evident inadequate global blood flow brain relatively uncommon cerebral hemorrhage rare cause brain damage cardiac operation . It also become evident one important damage mechanism embolization brain inflammatory response amplifies ischemic embolic damage . Looking possible embolic source monitor embolic signal ( HITS ) transcranial doppler ( TCD ) tracing , researcher find manipulation aorta cardiac surgery , like cannulation especially clamp major source embolus . Using side biting clamp perform proximal anastomosis potential crush aortic wall release macro micro emboli especially aorta atherosclerotic . Using single cross clamp technique might eliminate aortic wall solid debris introduce air embolus instead . Dealing problem , proximal anastomotic device introduce withdrawn market inferior patency rate . The Heartstring proximal anastomotic device one recently introduce device early good patency rate demonstrate . The advantage , term less brain embolization improve neurologic outcome , never demonstrate Heartstring anastomotic device . A recent potential breakthrough field emboli research prevention order improve neurologic outcome cardiac surgery introduction EmbodopR system DWL . This high quality TCD system develop monitor cerebral embolus . It contain module automatically screen every event suspect embolic , eliminate recognize artifact accord four different criterion record real embolic event . Another module differentiate every event gas solid embolus simultaneously insonating middle cerebral artery blood tow ultrasound beam , different frequency . The result new ability real time monitor characterization embolic event cardiac operation .</detailed_description>
