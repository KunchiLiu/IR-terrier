	<brief_summary>Aim 1 . To compare across three hospital site effect health cost outcome observe follow three intervention , design enhance adaptation improve outcome hospitalize cognitively impaired elder caregiver : 1. augment standard care ( ASC ) - standard hospital , refer , home care plus early identification CI patient ' hospitalization train registered nurse ( RNs ) immediate feedback patient ' primary nurse , attend physician discharge planner ; 2. resource nurse care ( RNC ) - standard hospital , refer , home care plus early identification CI patient 's hospitalization train RNs hospital care RNs train use expert clinical guideline develop enhance care management hospitalize cognitively impaired elder facilitate transition hospital home ; , 3. advanced practice nurse care ( APNC ) - standard hospital care plus transitional ( hospital home ) care substitute standard home care provide APNs advance train management CI patient use evidence-based protocol design specifically patient group caregiver . [ H1 ] We hypothesize health cost outcome APNC , comprehensive intervention design meet unique need cognitively impaired old adult hospitalize acute medical surgical event caregiver associate , relative health cost outcome ASC RNC , improvement patient , caregiver cost outcome . [ H2 ] We hypothesize improvement patient , caregiver cost outcome observe RNC group great observe ASC group . Aim 2 . To compare within site time , health cost outcome ( identify Aim 1 ) patient treat either ASC RNC , relatively low intensity intervention , outcomes patient site observe switch APNC , high intensity intervention . [ H3 ] We hypothesize compare patient receive ASC RNC intervention , patient site improve patient , caregiver cost outcome site switch APNC . [ H4 ] We hypothesize patient , caregiver cost outcome achieve group receive APNC intervention T1 T2 similar .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment ( CI ) major health problem complicate care increase number old adult hospitalize acute medical surgical condition . Dementia delirium , common cause CI among elder , associate high mortality rate , increase morbidity high health care cost . A grow body science suggest patient caregiver particularly vulnerable system care either recognize ignore need . The consequence devastate patient caregiver add tremendous burden hospital staff cop severe shortage nurse . For reason , Institute Medicine identify improve care management patient group national priority action . Unfortunately , little evidence available guide optimal care patient group address unique need caregiver . Collectively , available evidence suggest patient may benefit intervention aim improve management CI , comorbid condition exact nature intensity intervention need effectively efficiently improve outcome caregiver know . Thus , time excellent rigorous research aim identify care management strategy result high quality , cost-effective outcome challenge patient group caregiver .</detailed_description>
