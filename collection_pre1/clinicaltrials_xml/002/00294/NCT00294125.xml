	<detailed_description>OA lead chronic disease old adult characterize degeneration articular cartilage joint hand , spine , knee , hip . In joint , tissue injury pain cause conversion arachidonic acid inflammatory compound cyclooxygenases-1 -2 ( COX-1 -2 ) 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LO ) . Conventional NSAIDs inhibit COX-1 -2 , little effect 5-LO . NSAIDs provide relief pain OA ; however , NSAIDS also associate significant side effect , include gastrointestinal bleeding , venous thrombosis , nephrotoxicity . Novel alternative therapy increase safety efficacy few side effect desirable ; plant-derived substance might useful alternative NSAIDs . Flavocoxid , botanical extract derive two plant , Scutellaria baicalensis Acacia catechu , show inhibit COX-1 -2 well 5-LO . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy flavocoxid relieving symptom knee OA adult . This study last 12 week . Participants randomly assign one two group . Group 1 participant receive daily flavocoxid ; Group 2 participant receive placebo . There 5 study visit : study entry Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 . Joint pain , tenderness , swell assess study visit . A 30-foot timed walk test also perform visit . A physical exam blood collection occur study entry Week 12 . Other study assessment include safety monitoring , patient/physician global disease rating , quality life measure , depression anxiety rating , measure efficacy determined Western Ontario McMaster ( WOMAC ) OA index .</detailed_description>
