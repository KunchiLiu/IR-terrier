	<brief_summary>Pneumococcus major cause morbidity mortality . In 2000 , pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) license use child part routine childhood vaccine schedule . PCV known reduce invasive disease protect nasopharyngeal ( NP ) acquisition vaccine serotype pneumococcus ; also result increase risk nonvaccine serotype carriage . This study propose assess longterm impact vaccine NP carriage set intense antibody pressure ecology pneumococcus . A cross sectional study pneumococcal NP colonization among American Indian child combine surveillance invasive disease population . The purpose determine impact community wide PCV use NP colonization relationship invasive disease . This longterm safety issue need assess fully evaluate impact vaccine NP ecology invasive disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There four specific aim study : ( 1 ) determine overall serotype specific prevalence incidence pneumococcal carriage among child adult high risk carriage disease era routine pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) use compare measure population prior use PCV vaccine ; ( 2 ) characterize intrafamilial NP transmission clone among live child le 8 year age ; ( 3 ) determine immune correlate protection serotype specific pneumococcal carriage among individual immunize immunized PCV ; ( 4 ) determine relative invasiveness serotypes pneumococcus era widespread PCV use compare relative invasiveness serotypes prior routine use PCV .</detailed_description>
