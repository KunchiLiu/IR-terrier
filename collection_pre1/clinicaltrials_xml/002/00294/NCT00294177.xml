	<detailed_description>The conformational change human chorionic gonadotropin beta ( hCG beta ) chemotherapy gestational trophoblastic disease clinical meaning well understood . In study use atomic force microscopy dual polarisation interferometry measure dimension conformational change beta human chorionic gonadotropin chemotherapy persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor . Gestational trophoblastic disease comprise spectrum disease different propensity local invasion metastasis , , partial complete hydatidiform mole , choriocarcinoma , placental site trophoblastic tumor . Persistent trophoblastic disease may develop partial complete mole . All trophoblastic tumor produce human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) , monitor therapy largely base determination hCG serum . The malignant form also express excessive amount hCG beta , simultaneous determination hCG hCG beta use differentiate molar disease trophoblastic cancer , associate proportion hCG beta exceed 5 % . Over glycosylated hCG also report characteristic trophoblastic cancer , clinical utility remain establish . The hCG beta level serum also use evaluate prognosis high also low level relation tumor burden indicative adverse prognosis . Because : 1 ) . malignant form also express excessive amount hCG beta ; 2 ) . half-life hCG beta longer hCG ; 3 ) . hCG beta /hCG ratio increase level decrease successful therapy ; 4 ) . ratio find increase development therapy-resistant disease , monitor gestational trophoblastic disease usually rely human chorionic gonadotropin beta measurement . Treatment choriocarcinoma often monitor serial assay hCG beta serum level undetectable , simultaneous determination hCG beta sometimes reveal relapse earlier hCG . Therefore , measurement hCG beta important treatment gestational trophoblastic tumor . Human choriogonadotropin belongs family heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone comprise two noncovalently bond subunit four N-linked carbohydrate . During chemotherapy , hCG beta molecule degrade . A study report crystallographic analysis find crystal deglycosylated human chorionic gonadotropin hexagonal bipyramidal structure use method vapor diffusion ammonium sulfate . Previously , conformation hCG molecule rarely study . By chemical method , glycosylated hCG report characteristic trophoblastic cancer , clinical utility remain establish . Photoelectric method newly develop method study conformation protein glycoprotein molecule . As yet , report conformation hCG serial study . Gestational trophoblastic tumor well gynecological cancer often underwent antitumor chemotherapy monitor tumor marker . During antineoplastic chemotherapy , conformational change tumor marker , include hCG beta persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor cancer clinical meaning rarely study . Up present time , still well understood whether conformational change reduce stability heterodimer may occur chemotherapy . In study use atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) probe surface nanostructure beta human chorionic gonadotropin . The conformational change beta human chorionic gonadotropin secrete persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor chemotherapy study . We also want directly visualize single molecular structure beta human chorionic gonadotropin , quantitative measurement dimension glycoprotein provide . The average height calculate hCG beta particle measure compare subsequently chemotherapy . Moreover , experiment use dual polarization interferometric ( DPI ) biosensor also perform , average monolayer thickness value also calculate . To investigate surface ultrastructure hCG beta molecule , hCG beta sample low concentration scan vacuum AFM . The higher-resolution image clearly reveal shape hCG beta molecule . In addition , phase image hCG beta molecule capture simultaneously height image , lateral dimension shape hCG beta molecule measure calculate . The average value calculate outside diameter pore diameter thus obtain . This study represent first direct characterization surface ultrastructure hCG beta molecule nanometer scale . The physical measurement outer diameter , pore diameter , protomer diameter hCG beta AFM DPI may suggest recognize hCG beta molecule , constitute important tumor marker chemotherapy persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor . Unraveling molecular structure measure dimension hCG beta may provide new direction future application clinical hCG beta sensor chip . In also likely dimensional change hCG beta molecule may also clinical implication persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor .</detailed_description>
