	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare body reacts different strength new A/H5N1 flu vaccine give addition aluminum hydroxide adjuvant provide dose information . How body 's immune system respond new H5N1vaccine aluminum hydroxide approximately 1 month follow receipt 2 dos vaccine also evaluate . The vaccine give injection shot arm . Volunteer participant study 600 healthy elderly adult , age 65 year old . Participants randomly assign 4 different dosage group vaccine , either without adjuvant , total 8 different group . Volunteers participate study 7 month . Each individual receive two vaccination , second 28 day first . In addition visit vaccination , subject return clinic physical evaluation blood sample collection 6 time course study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>H5 Vaccine Alone With Aluminum Hydroxide Elderly Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize , control , dose-ranging , Phase I-II study healthy ambulatory elderly adult . The primary objective : determine dose-related safety subvirion-inactivated H5N1 vaccine adjuvanted aluminum hydroxide healthy elderly adult ( 65 year age old ) ; determine potential aluminum hydroxide enhance immune response subvirion inactivate H5N1 vaccine healthy elderly adult approximately 1 month follow receipt 2 dos vaccine ; provide information selection best dosage level study . A secondary objective evaluate dose-related immunogenicity percent subject respond approximately 1 7 month first vaccination . Approximately 600 elderly subject plan enrollment . Subjects screen health status history target physical examination . Subjects meet entry criterion study randomize 8 group receive 2 dos nonadjuvanted aluminum hydroxide-adjuvanted influenza A/H5N1 vaccine contain 3.75 , 7.5 , 15 , 45 microgram hemagglutinin ( HA ) intramuscular injection . The first vaccination occur Day 0 . Symptoms sign assess clinic least 15 minute inoculation , subject maintain memory aid record oral temperature systemic local adverse event ( AEs ) 7 day immunization . Subjects encouraged take temperature around time day . All subject return clinic Days 2 8 vaccination assessment AEs concomitant medication , well targeted physical examination indicate . Memory aid review visit . At approximately Day 28 first vaccination , subject return clinic blood sample collection safety follow-up , follow second vaccination . Safety follow-up identical perform first vaccination . Approximately 56 day first immunization ( 28 day second vaccination ) , subject return clinic immunogenicity blood sample collection , AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination ( indicate ) . At approximately Day 208 ( 7 month first vaccination ) , subject return clinic final immunogenicity blood sample collection follow-up , include targeted physical examination indicate . The duration study treatment subject 7 month . The primary study endpoint include : AE serious adverse event ( SAE ) information ; proportion subject dose group achieve serum neutralize antibody titer great equal 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ; proportion subject dose group achieve serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer great equal 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ; geometric mean titer ( GMT ) frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer group 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ; GMT frequency 4-fold great increase serum HAI antibody titer group 28 day receipt second dose vaccine . The secondary endpoint include : GMT frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer group 1 month 7 month receipt first dose vaccine ; GMT frequency 4-fold great increase</detailed_description>
