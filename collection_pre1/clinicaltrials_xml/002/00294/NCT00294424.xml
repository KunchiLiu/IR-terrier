	<detailed_description>The aim study compare cost-effectiveness major joint replacement patient short non-fixed ( control group ) wait time ( WT ) . After place wait list , patient randomize two group regular contact practice staff : 1 . Patients non-fixed waiting time ( patient undergoes hospital 's normal procedure date ( ) add wait list date operation ) , 2. patient short wait time ( operate maximum three month ) . For ethical reason , care take avoid risk inequality patient group . Such inequality might result patient wait access treatment longer normally short wait time would account half hospital 's surgical capacity , instance . The number patient place wait list varies one month another , specific hospital . Therefore advance estimate make number patient placed list . Consequently , follow arrangement make : 1. patient randomise short WT group could operate every fourth month , half hospital 's one-month surgical capacity could allocate short WTs , number short WTs restrict determine specifically hospital ; 2. ensure eligible patient place wait list chance get recruit study ( include possibility short WT ) restrict size non-fixed WT group . In order avoid selection bias among patient , group different size . 3 . Recruitments make period three month order avoid wait time short WT group exceed three month . Randomization make nurse responsible use consecutively number sealed envelope . Participants complete self-administered questionnaire four specific point time : 1. place wait list orthopaedic surgeon ( baseline ) , 2. hospital admission , 3. three , 4 . 12 month surgery .</detailed_description>
