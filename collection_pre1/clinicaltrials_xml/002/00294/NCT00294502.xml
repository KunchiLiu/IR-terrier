	<detailed_description>Scope problem . A large number hemodialysis patient country rely indwell tunnel non-tunneled catheter vascular access hemodialysis even though K/DOQI guideline discourage use . In study perform ESRD network 11 , [ Michigan dialysis center submit data ] 63 % patient initiated HD catheter sole form vascular access . At 6 month initiation HD , 40 % patient still use catheter . Other study show prevalence overall catheter use around 20 % access . Catheter associated infection . Current literature indicate catheter associate disproportionate risk infection , particularly CRB , result high morbidity , mortality healthcare expenditure . The ‘ epidemic ’ ESRD country see ever increase reliance catheter initiate HD also long term treatment patient access option . It estimate intravascular catheter associate 60,000 case nosocomial bacteremia year . HD catheter pose particularly high risk develop infection frequent use well long-term use . All indwell vascular catheter colonize micro-organism within 24 hour insertion . The deposition biofilm external internal surface vascular catheter think play important role colonization process . The biofilm produce combination host factor ( e.g. , fibrinogen , fibrin , fibronectin extracellular polysaccharide ) microbial product ( e.g. , glycocalyx `` slime '' ) . Failure antibiotic . Systemic antibiotic use treat bacteremia penetrate catheter lumen therefore eradicate biofilm , lead potential treatment failure eventual sacrifice catheter . Recently publish data suggest use combination solution antibacterial/anticoagulant agent prevents formation ‘ biofilm ’ catheter lumen thereby prevent CRB , well salvage catheter case establish CRB . However , continue debate appropriate antibacterial agent well optimal concentration , order eradicate wide variety organism . Several strategy study past 10 year prevent CRB CRI . These include eradication nasal Staphylococcal carriage mupirocin , use chlorhexidine catheter hub clean exit site disinfection use mupirocin Polysporin ointment exit site along standard dressing . But emergence antibiotic resistance well high cost administrate method continue barrier widespread use rely upon manage high rate infection . Salvaging catheter . In past , infected catheter routinely remove , especially Staphylococcus aureus infection , per CDC guideline . However , recent small study indicate strategy ALS pack change catheter guide wire salvage significant fraction catheter , thereby save expense morbidity , preserve site . Thrombotic occlusion infection two common complication HD catheter , predispose . Some study show ALS pack also improve long-term catheter function prevent formation propagation biofilm . Studying aspect catheter maintenance also important outcome propose study . Antibiotic Lock Solutions . We identify 10 clinical trial ( attach appendix ) publish literature describe result antibiotic lock therapy prevent infection indwell vascular catheter . All one demonstrate efficacy ALS packing . Of 9 successful trial , 6 randomize control trial 3 do HD catheter , describe . Need prospective study . If achieve superior result study incorporating ALS packing strategy , able assess cost- effectiveness use ALS pack vs. standard approach discuss previous trial , systematically study . In fact insufficient number patient study even perform meta-analysis . We feel critical prove cost-effectiveness new strategy order use widespread fashion . The applicant , Anatole Besarab MD , extensive experience Nephrology specifically vascular access management . He publish , lecture , coordinate symposia vascular access care current chair K/DOQI vascular access workgroup NKF . This project conceive following reason . - The CRB burden hemodialysis patient institution reach overwhelming proportion need urgent strategy counter ‘ epidemic ’ . Current management guideline rely mostly treatment establish infection aim prevent infection . This kind economic burden increase morbidity/mortality patient unacceptable current health care environment . Our study add exist literature define management guideline CRB . - The Greenfield Health System ( GHS ) provide dialysis care patient Henry Ford Health System include several hundred patient would ideal set study propose intervention . This population also represent cross-section many type disease severity number co-morbid condition . Therefore provide opportunity observe effect propose intervention different demographic setting . - Henry Ford Hospital represent completely new demography study effect propose intervention . The disease burden CRB population serve area high national average would ideal study propose intervention detail . - The cost effectiveness use antibiotic lock therapy well studied date significant impact eventual formulation treatment guideline . In set current economic burden health care industry , study issue vital timely . The vision simple , cheap intervention result saving million dollar central study .</detailed_description>
