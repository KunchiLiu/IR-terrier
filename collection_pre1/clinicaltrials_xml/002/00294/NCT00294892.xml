	<detailed_description>Without use preventative measure , risk mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HIV-1 estimate vary 25 48 % . The regimen single dose nevirapine mother delivery single dose nevirapine newborn within 24 - 72 hour birth reduces risk MTCT 50 % , affordable many situation therefore standard care many African country , like Tanzania . Recent study , however , show single dose mother induce occurrence nevirapine resistance large number mother . The mechanism occurrence nevirapine resistance already single dose likely related long elimination half-life drug . The subtherapeutic plasma level present perfect environment occurrence resistance concentration subinhibitory several day .</detailed_description>
