	<detailed_description>The focus present study evaluate usefulness cidofovir injection diminish frequency magnitude papilloma recurrence adult pediatric RRP patient . Briefly , patient randomize either treatment ( cidofovir injection ) placebo group . The following measure make 6 data collection time point , course one year : ( 1 ) tumor load , base upon publish stag system papilloma , ( 2 ) degree respiratory obstruction phonation , assess phonation threshold pressure , ( 3 ) general health , validate health inventory ( SF12 Voice Handicap Index adult ; Peds QL child ) via measure height weight day absent school daycare , applicable , child . A repeated measure analysis allow examination time treatment interaction determine cidofovir injection group few , less severe , recurrence placebo group . Specifically , answer follow question investigation : 1 . Does cidofovir injection reduce frequency RRP recurrence ? 2 . Does cidofovir injection reduce magnitude RRP , assess propose stag system RRP ( Derkay et al. , 1998 ) measure phonatory threshold pressure ? 3 . Does cidofovir injection improve general health , assess height , weight day absent school pediatric patient health inventory ( general health voice-related ) child adult ?</detailed_description>
