	<detailed_description>Glutamate aspartate identify major excitatory neurotransmitter central nervous system . A massive increase release excitatory amino acid ( EEA ) describe follow traumatic brain injury . The result overstimulation neuronal EAA receptor , particularly N-Methyl-D-Aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor , lead excessive influx calcium receptor gate ion-channels , cause metabolic derangement finally cell death . Although exact role EEA patient suffer severe head injury remain establish , show sustained high intracranial pressure ( ICP ) poor outcome significantly correlate high level EEA use microdialysis . Disadvantages microdialysis use evaluate limited part brain apply acute phase follow injury . The limit also apply ICP measurement . Therefore , method evaluate extent time course damage vivo urgently need . Peripheral type benzodiazepine bind site potential candidate monitoring neuronal damage . They normally present cerebral tissue , follow neuronal damage , cell involve ensue gliosis show mark expression site . ( R ) -PK11195 ligand selectively bind peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor . Labeled carbon-11 uptake measure Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) . Thus , ( R ) - [ 11C ] PK11195 PET use monitor in-vivo gliosis brain injury . A maximum twenty patient traumatic brain injury include study . A microdialysis probe place brain parenchyma continuously measure EEA first PET scan perform . Several cerebral haemodynamic parameter , ICP mean arterial blood pressure , register . All patient receive two Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan evaluate extent anatomical localization cerebral damage . Three ( R ) - [ 11C ] PK11195 PET scan perform : 1 week , 1 month 6 month injury . Outcome determine use several outcome scale , include Glasgow Outcome Scale six month . In addition , patient investigate repeated neuropsychological examination .</detailed_description>
