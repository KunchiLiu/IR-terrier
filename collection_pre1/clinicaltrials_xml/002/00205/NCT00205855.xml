	<brief_summary>There many treatment option available management chronic pain . Some include , limited , over-the-counter medication , Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs , Physical Therapy , Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) nerve block . Historically , mainstay pain treatment pharmacotherapy . However , pharmacotherapy vary degree effectiveness often associate undesirable side effect . Although many patient successfully treat , fail conservative therapy remain option limit spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) , proven effective therapy half fail conservative treatment . Over 50 % fail conservative method pain management , , guidance clinician utilizing SCS , pain level successfully manage . SCS less invasive therapy reversible treatment great long-term benefit permanent , radical approach one deserve great consideration management chronic , intractable pain .</brief_summary>
