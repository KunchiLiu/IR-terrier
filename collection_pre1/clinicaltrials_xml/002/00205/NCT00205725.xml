	<brief_summary>Abnormalities peripheral glucose regulation type 2 diabetes occur commonly individual schizophrenia healthy subject psychiatric condition . Antipsychotic treatment may contribute significantly abnormality glucose regulation . Hyperglycemia contribute long-term cardiovascular disease risk may already increase patient schizophrenia due high rate smoke , sedentary life style , obesity under-treated hypertension dyslipidemia . This project characterize effect glucose control two commonly prescribe new antipsychotic medication , ziprasidone olanzapine , patient schizophrenia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal aim use well-characterized procedure , modify Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test ( FSIGTT ) , characterize glucoregulatory effect two commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic medication , ziprasidone olanzapine , comparison conventional antipsychotic haloperidol . Abnormalities peripheral glucose regulation type 2 diabetes occur commonly individual schizophrenia healthy subject psychiatric condition . While abnormality glucose regulation first report schizophrenia prior introduction antipsychotic medication , antipsychotic treatment may contribute significantly abnormality glucose regulation . Recently , adverse effect antipsychotic medication systemic glucose regulation receive increased attention investigator note prominent adverse glucoregulatory effect associate certain new antipsychotic medication . Abnormal glucose regulation new-onset type 2 diabetes report clozapine olanzapine treatment . Complicating study antipsychotic-induced change glucose regulation , increase adiposity decrease insulin sensitivity , antipsychotic increase adiposity body mass index ( BMI ) . However , abnormal glucose regulation type 2 diabetes occur clozapine treatment absence weight gain , suggest change glucose regulation occur independent drug-induced increase BMI . Consistent , preliminary study indicate important effect clozapine olanzapine glucose regulation account difference BMI . This proposal compare effect olanzapine , ziprasidone haloperidol well-defined measure glucose regulation . This proposal specifically hypothesize olanzapine treatment associate decrease insulin sensitivity ( SI ) , without effect insulin secretion . Treatment-related effect glucose effectiveness ( SG ) explore .</detailed_description>
