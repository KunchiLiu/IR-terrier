We hypothesize switch aripiprazole treatment induce improvement total body adiposity , inflammation ( e.g. , high sensitivity C-reactive protein [ hsCRP ] ) , glucose metabolism ( e.g. , insulin sensitivity ) lipid metabolism ( e.g. , fast plasma triglyceride ) , comparison chronic pretreatment olanzapine , risperidone quetiapine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Adiposity , Metabolic Measures From Atypicals Aripiprazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia associate increase rate obesity , hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , cause increase morbidity mortality due acute ( e.g. , diabetic ketoacidosis ) long-term ( e.g. , vascular disease ) complications.1-5As result , cardiovascular ( CV ) mortality remain one leading cause excess mortality patient psychotic disorders.6,7 T2DM characterize disturbance insulin secretion insulin action skeletal muscle ( i.e. , decrease glucose disposal ) , liver ( i.e. , increase glucose production ) adipose tissue ( i.e. , increased lipolysis ) , lead disturbance glucose lipid metabolism . The metabolic syndrome insulin resistance , hyperinsulinemia , dyslipidemia abdominal adiposity usually include procoagulant state endothelial dysfunction , strongly associate increase CV morbidity mortality . Hyperglycemia first note patient schizophrenia prior introduction antipsychotic medication , glucoregulatory defect , dyslipidemia increase adiposity additionally associate old newer antipsychotic treatments.1 In patient , metabolic derangement primarily relate increase adiposity , although treatment effect independent adiposity may also play role 25 % case new onset T2DM antipsychotic treatment.8,9 Increased adiposity , especially visceral abdominal adiposity , associate insulin resistance , elevate plasma lipid , increase inflammatory marker . All condition contribute elevate mortality directly measure patient treat different medication . Direct measure adiposity , insulin action secretion , plasma lipid level inflammation available well validated predictor CV disease T2DM complication . Unfortunately , date , study use large population-based sample patient take antipsychotic medication use insensitive measure , like random glucose , surrogate measure prescription oral hypoglycemic agent , estimate prevalence T2DM antipsychotic treatment . No data available concern insulin sensitivity secretion , plasma lipid inflammatory marker large population-based sample individual treat antipsychotic medication . Reviewed , limit data available small analytic study use sensitive measure . Despite convergent evidence contribution adiposity metabolic derangement associate antipsychotic treatment , investigator begin use direct measure adiposity characterize weight gain associate antipsychotic treatment . This proposal aim use well-validated methodology dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) , frequently sample oral glucose tolerance test ( fsOGTTs ) , hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp characterize metabolic effect 12 week aripiprazole treatment follow chronic pretreatment olanzapine , quetiapine , risperidone ziprasidone . We hypothesize switch aripiprazole treatment induce improvement total body adiposity , inflammation ( e.g. , high sensitivity C-reactive protein [ hsCRP ] ) , glucose metabolism ( e.g. , insulin sensitivity ) lipid metabolism ( e.g. , fast plasma triglyceride ) , comparison chronic pretreatment olanzapine , risperidone quetiapine . Aim 1 : To characterize glucoregulatory effect 12 week aripiprazole treatment . This study hypothesize switch aripiprazole treatment associate statistically significant improvement glucose metabolism ( e.g. , insulin sensitivity ) comparison chronic pretreatment olanzapine . Given planned sample size study duration , hypothesize aripiprazole treatment associate numerical , statistically significant , improvement comparison pretreatment risperidone quetiapine . We hypothesize aripiprazole treatment associate significant change comparison pretreatment ziprasidone . These hypothesis evaluate measure insulin sensitivity index via fsOGTTs hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp . Aim 2 : To evaluate medication-related measure abdominal fat , total body fat total fat-free mass . This study hypothesize switch aripiprazole treatment associate reduction adipose tissue mass comparison olanzapine . We hypothesize aripiprazole treatment associate numerical , statistically significant , reduction comparison pretreatment risperidone quetiapine . We hypothesize aripiprazole treatment associate change comparison pretreatment ziprasidone . These hypothesis evaluate measure body composition use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) anthropomorphic measurement provide estimate total body fat , abdominal fat fat-free mass . Aim 3 : To characterize change lipid profile high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) 12 week aripiprazole treatment . This study hypothesize switch aripiprazole treatment associate reduction lipid level hsCRP comparison olanzapine . We hypothesize aripiprazole treatment associate numerical , statistically significant , reduction comparison pretreatment risperidone quetiapine . We hypothesize aripiprazole treatment associate change comparison pretreatment ziprasidone . These hypothesis evaluate use fast lipid profile measurement plasma hsCRP .</detailed_description>
