	<detailed_description>Alzheimer ’ disease ( AD ) fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterize progressive impairment daily life , cognitive deterioration , variety neuropsychiatric behavioural symptom . The diagnosis AD base clinical criterion , low sensitivity specificity AD early stage disease . Therefore , great need method identify pathological process AD earlier , preclinical stage . In-vivo image quantification pathological beta-amyloid ( Aß ) accumulation may provide method production accumulation Aß think central pathogenesis AD . The view widely hold Aß may present brain sublethal concentration extend period overt manifestation AD . Therefore , early , in-vivo detection pathological Aß accumulation warrant may identify subject risk AD . Neuroimaging Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) permit in-vivo image quantification cerebral amyloid load , novel application PET . Recently , several PET tracer ( [ 18F ] FDDNP [ 11C ] PIB ) develop purpose first clinical study patient AD encourage . For tracer , many methodological issue still need resolve clinical value in-vivo amyloid imaging remain establish . The important objective project twofold : provide independent unbiased evaluation value in-vivo amyloid imaging ( early ) diagnosis AD optimize method quantification in-vivo cerebral amyloid load . To investigate value early diagnosis , identification subject risk AD essential . Patients amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , i.e patient suffer memory problem without symptom AD , recruit purpose . MCI disease state consider transitional state normal age dementia . It generally accept ability identify presence Alzheimer type pathology MCI stage benefit disease management . Twenty patient amnestic MCI , 15 patient AD 15 age sex match healthy control include study . Only consecutive new patient fulfil criterion amnestic MCI include . Patients MCI remain clinical observation two year participation order monitor conversion clinical dementia . All subject receive [ 11C ] PIB [ 18F ] FDDNP PET scan single day . In addition , patient receive [ 18F ] FDG PET scan . Furthermore , MRI scan , neuropsychological evaluation CSF analysis diagnostic purpose perform subject .</detailed_description>
