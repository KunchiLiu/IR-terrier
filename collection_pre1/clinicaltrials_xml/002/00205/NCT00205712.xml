	<brief_summary>Ketamine , FDA approve anesthetic agent , become sedative/analgesic choice emergency sedation child cause deep sedation minimal respiratory depression comparison available agent . However , emergence reaction important adverse effect ketamine , characterize transient change cognitive function , dissociation mild schizophrenia-like symptom . These cognitive behavioral effect dose-dependently induced ketamine antagonists N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) glutamate receptor . NMDA receptor hypofunction disinhibit excitatory ( cholinergic/glutamatergic ) projection key area brain , propose explain key feature schizophrenia . Several treatment block excessive excitatory transmitter release also show prevent cognitive behavioral effect ketamine-induced NMDA receptor hypofunction human . Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist , presynaptically inhibit acetylcholine release , prevent mild ketamine-induced behavioral cognitive symptom healthy human adult . However , prevention strategy evaluate child . Children currently receive clinically-indicated treatment NMDA antagonist , ketamine , age group important target pharmacological strategy aim prevention schizophrenia . This application propose double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized trial test safety effectiveness dexmedetomidine , FDA approve alpha-2 adrenergic agonist , prevent ketamine-induced mental symptom child . Planned primary analysis evaluate effect hypothesize prevention treatment clinical cognitive variable use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . The proposed experiment relevant future prevention trial individual risk schizophrenia , prevent adverse effect NMDA antagonist anesthetic agent ( ketamine , nitrous oxide ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study conduct use exist dedicated clinical research space St. Louis Children 's Hospital 's Emergency Department , Pediatric Clinical Research Center ( PCRC ) , Orthopedic Clinic . This project 3 major aim 1 exploratory aim address prospective randomize blind placebo control drug trial test whether pharmacological strategy prevent NMDA receptor hypofunction-induced behavioral cognitive dysfunction pre- post-pubertal child . Based previous preclinical clinical research effect blockade effect ketamine similar compound , study investigator carefully select dose alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine permit study conduct low risk enrol subject undergo clinically-indicated ketamine sedation forearm fracture reduction . General Experimental Design : This project test safety effectiveness dexmedetomidine prevent ketamine-induced behavioral cognitive symptom healthy human child undergo clinically indicate ketamine sedation forearm fracture reduction . Aims 1 2 addressed randomize , blind administration dexmedetomidine saline placebo ketamine-sedated subject test efficacy dexmedetomidine prevent ketamine-induced behavioral cognitive change recovery sedation . Aim 3 address compare subject randomize receive dexmedetomidine saline placebo measurement distress frequency adverse cardiopulmonary effect sedation , fracture-reduction , recovery .</detailed_description>
