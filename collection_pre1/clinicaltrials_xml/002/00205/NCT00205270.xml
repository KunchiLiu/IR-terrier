	<brief_summary>Research Question : How antibody T cell response follow influenza vaccine compare among lung transplant patient , patient wait lung transplantation healthy individual ? Experimental Design : This interventional parallel group study compare influenza vaccine induce immune response three group : lung transplant patient , individual wait lung transplantation healthy individual . Current Future Research Activities : Blood drawn measure vaccine induce antibody response 2 4 week immunization . Another blood draw obtain 30 individual among three group measure T cell response immunization . The third blood draw do month 1 5 follow influenza immunization . Genetic material ( DNA ) obtain cell blood look genetic marker may associate influenza vaccine response . Blood draws immunization healthy participant do General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Clinical Research Facility Rennebohm Hall . The blood draw pre-transplant post-transplant patient coordinate clinically indicated laboratory test order avoid additional venipuncture . Influenza immunization part routine clinical care patient lung disease , immune response data consider part research study .</brief_summary>
