	<brief_title>Effect Increased Convective Clearance On-Line Hemodiafiltration All Cause Mortality Chronic Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today , increase number patient chronic renal failure ( CRF ) treat ( on-line ) hemodiafiltration ( HDF ) . This practice base assumption high incidence cardiovascular ( CV ) disease , observed patient CRF , least partially related retention uremic toxin middle large-middle molecular ( MM ) range . As HDF lower molecule effectively HD , suggest treatment improves CV outcome , compare standard HD . Thus far , definite data effect HDF CV parameter and/or clinical end-points available . Promising data include reduction leave ventricular mass index ( LVMi ) one year treatment acetate free bio-filtration ( AFB ) . Furthermore , relatively high survival rate report single center non-experimental study patient treat HDF , compare EDTA registry data HD-treated patient . Yet , data observational nature , possibility bias confound indication . As accumulation MMW substance implicate increased oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction , reduction compound might improve derangement . In addition , cardiac dysfunction , atherosclerosis ( measure leave ventricular mass index [ LVMi ] , carotid intima medium thickness [ CIMT ] ) vascular stiffness ( measure pulse wave velocity [ PWV ] ) might reduce HDF , compare low-flux HD . Therefore , propose prospective , randomized multicenter trial , compare ( on-line ) HDF HD . After stabilization period , expect number 700 chronic HD patient randomize either HDF low-flux HD follow 1-6 year . Primary end point cause mortality combine CV event mortality . In addition , LVMi , PWV , CIMT various parameter oxidative stress , acute phase reaction ( APR ) endothelial function assess compare treatment group . This study provide strong evidence efficacy HDF compare low flux HD CV morbidity mortality , currently lack urgently need . It highly likely outcome study affect current clinical practice considerably , Netherlands well internationally . Moreover , study point towards mechanisms underlying effect HDF . The following hypothesis test : 1 . All-cause mortality combine CV morbidity mortality patient treat ( on-line ) HDF low patient treated standard low-flux HD . 2 . A reduction MMW uremic toxin HDF lead improvement 'uremic profile ' ( measure AGE-levels , homocysteine level , oxidative stress , endothelial dysfunction ) , compare standard low-flux HD . 3 . The improvement 'uremic profile ' HDF-treated patient result improvement endothelial function reduction progression vascular injury ( measure CIMT PWV ) reduction LVMi , compare standard low-flux HD .</detailed_description>
