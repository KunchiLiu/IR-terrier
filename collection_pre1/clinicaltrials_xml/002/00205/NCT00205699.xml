	<brief_summary>The prevalence overweight obesity , insulin resistance , hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) increase child . Increased adiposity relate reduction insulin sensitivity major risk factor development hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia , T2DM , cardiovascular disease . Reductions lifespan attributable obesity impact young individual measurably . Antipsychotic medication extensively use child , certain agent produce great increase weight adiposity commonly use drug age group . Increased use atypical antipsychotic child stimulate report efficacy behavior aggression occur variety disorder . However , previous randomize clinical trial sensitively quantify metabolic effect widely use atypical antipsychotic . This study would address clinically relevant question concern safety efficacy agent antipsychotic-naïve aggressive child conduct disorder , permit co-morbidity variety psychiatric condition include attention deficit disorder , bipolar disorder , high function pervasive developmental disorder , autism schizophrenia . The project aim describe compare outcome 12 week prospective , randomized treatment olanzapine , risperidone aripiprazole insulin action skeletal muscle , liver adipose tissue , insulin secretion , abdominal fat mass , total body fat-free mass , rest metabolic rate , efficacy symptom aggression non-metabolic adverse event . Children age 6-18 studied , explore effect stimulant therapy age-related difference vulnerability treatment-induced adverse metabolic change . Aims address measure glucose lipid kinetics stable isotope tracer , area-under-the-curve post-load insulin c-peptide frequently sample oral glucose tolerance test , body composition dual energy x-ray absorptiometry magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , indirect calorimetry standardize assessment efficacy adverse event . Treatment effect primarily analyze use repeated measure analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , control baseline adiposity key risk variable . Relevant data critically need target clinical therapy basic research , identify medical risk , guide regulatory decision vulnerable population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose randomized clinical trial aim ass safety efficacy atypical antipsychotic agent antipsychotic-naive aggressive child various childhood psychiatric disorder 12 week prospective , randomized treatment olanzapine ( Zyprexa ) , risperidone ( Risperdal ) aripiprazole ( Abilify ) . Aim 1 : To evaluate effect select antipsychotic treatment insulin action skeletal muscle ( glucose disposal ) , liver ( glucose production ) adipose tissue ( lipolysis ) . Aim 2 : To evaluate effect select antipsychotic treatment insulin secretion . Aim 3 : To evaluate effect select antipsychotic treatment abdominal fat mass , total body fat total fat-free mass . Aim 4 : To evaluate effect select antipsychotic treatment rest metabolic rate ( carbohydrate fat oxidation ) . Aim 5 : To evaluate effect select antipsychotic treatment efficacy symptom aggression . Important secondary aim include assessment non-metabolic adverse event , assessment antipsychotic treatment condition child without concomitant stimulant therapy . Reduced adverse metabolic effect hypothesize concomitant stimulant therapy . Children age 7-18 studied , explore age-related difference vulnerability treatment-induced adverse metabolic change . Finally , treatment effect regulatory hormone , include cortisol , glucagon , leptin , ghrelin adiponectin explore . This allow assessment possible confounds interpretation primary hypothesis . It also permit generation additional hypothesis concern mechanism contribute drug-induced change weight fat mass . Relevant data primary secondary aim critically need ass risk well benefit clinical therapy child , identify need additional basic research , well guide administrative regulatory decision-making .</detailed_description>
