	<brief_title>Study Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose Safety PEP005 Topical Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Actinic keratoses ( AK ) common skin condition characterize rough , scaly patch sores top layer skin leave untreated progress skin cancer . Current treatment cause scar hypopigmentation , inconvenient , require long treatment duration . Non-invasive alternative therapy treatment AK lesion thus research . This open label , dose escalation , cohort study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) PEP005 Topical Gel , administer daily two consecutive day ( 90 ul gel apply topically 3 x 3cm template surround target lesion ) , patient actinic keratoses ( AK ) . The study conduct one centre US . Three patient enter initially low dose level ( 0.01 % ) additional three patient enter event dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) initial patient . DLT define 'severe ' local skin reaction observe Investigator , either prior treatment Day 2 ( follow treatment Day 1 ) observe Day 8 ( follow treatment Day 2 ) . Based finding phase I study low systemic absorption find non-clinical toxicokinetic evaluation , systemic toxicity anticipated.Once determine A total 10 patient treat MTD order confirm 's determination . Based finding phase I study , start dose 0.01 % PEP005 Gel . Secondary objective study ( 1 ) evaluate clinical efficiency PEP005 Topical Gel , administer daily two consecutive day ( 2 ) determine systemic absorption PEP005 Topical Gel MTD . Hematologic biochemical assessment undertaken screen visit day 8 29 . Adverse event assess every study visit . Clinical response treatment assess Days 8 , 15 29 .</detailed_description>
