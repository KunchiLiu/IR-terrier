	<detailed_description>Patients cirrhosis tend retain sodium water lead development ascites , terminal stage decompensation eliminate despite use massive diuretic treatment . These decompensated patient high mortality 50 % within 3 year morbidity , symptomatic treatment able improve prognosis . It hypothesize ascites edema develop first due renal sodium retention secondary increase activity hormone like angiotensin II aldosterone , may stimulate reduce arterial filling cause systemic vasodilatation , secondly due liver fibrosis may cause lymphatic overflow formation ascites . Decreased central volume fill believe stimulate baroreceptor activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system , sympathetic nervous system arginine vasopressin . In cirrhotic patient systemic vasodilatation hypotension , tachycardia , increase cardiac output increase plasma volume think cause increased level vasodilating substance like nitric oxide ( NO ) , block NO synthesis use N ( G ) -monomethyl-L-arginine-acetate ( L-NMMA ) favorably influence renal sodium excretion , probably due important role NOS renal sodium handling . It evident pathophysiology development excessive sodium water retention cirrhotic patient insufficiently elucidate , increase knowledge field may improve therapeutic possibility . Patients cirrhosis without ascites normal increase glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) normal suppress plasma level renin , angiotensin II aldosterone . Later renal blood flow GFR may decrease patient avid tubular sodium reabsorption produce virtually sodium-free urine . These functional renal change regress transplantation normal liver . Suggestions make overfill rather central underfilling precede ascites formation . In case block mineralocorticoid receptor spironolactone effective diuretic treatment many cirrhotic patient , point importance distal part nephron mediation excess sodium reabsorption . Angiotensin II ( ANG II ) bind AT1 receptor localize renal glomerulus tubule , adrenal arteriole , efferent arteriole kidney , also resistance vessel systemic vasculature . In adrenal ANG II stimulate aldosterone secretion . In addition show rat expression vasopressin receptor V2 upregulated ang II , effect expect increase water reabsorption ( 10 ) . Most likely ANG II aggravate portal hypertension due stimulation stellate myofibroblasts , may part circulus vitiosus broken cirrrhosis . In another volume retain disorder - heart failure - blockade renin angiotensin aldosterone system show extremely effective retard progression disease . Treatment cirrhotic patient ACE-inhibitors try poorly tolerate since blood pressure GFR decrease . In one study , however , addition low dose Captopril furosemide spironolactone increase natriuresis half patient . It could expect ANG II blocker would well tolerate cirrhotic patient , bradykinin metabolism , production NO prostaglandins affect . Accordingly three recent study show low dose ANG II receptor type I block increased sodium excretion cirrhotic patient without affect systemic renal hemodynamics , also patient normal systemic level renin-angiotensin-aldosterone . Losartan dose 7.5 mg able counteract sodium retention otherwise demonstrate preascitic patient go supine stand position . Low dose Losartan could inhibit sodium retention preascitic patient give high sodium diet . Losartan give high dose -25 mg daily - preascitic ascitic patient increase GFR natriuresis without affection blood pressure . In contrast previous result Schneider et al find Losartan able reduce portal pressure cirrhotic patient dose systemic circulation adversely affect , even natriuretic effect could demonstrate . Accordingly reduce effect ANG II antagonist Irbesartan demonstrate . Unfortunately ameliorate effect ANG II antagonists portal pressure without adverse effect blood pressure could demonstrate two recent study . A long-term ( year ) longitudinal study cirrhotic patient registration consecutive change sodium handling , systemic renal hemodynamics neurohumoral regulation never do likely elucidate pathophysiology patient . In addition hypothesize early intervention ANG II receptor antagonist Losartan could delay even prevent development decompensated stage thus improve survival quality life patient .</detailed_description>
