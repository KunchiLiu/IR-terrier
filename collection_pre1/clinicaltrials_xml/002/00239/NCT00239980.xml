	<brief_summary>Epithelial ovarian carcinoma ( EOC ) 5th lead cause death among woman . Long-term survival poor majority woman EOC many present advance disease . Chemotherapy cytoreductive surgery produce 50 % - 60 % response rate relapse uncommon . Adding systemic agent fail show clear benefit survival associate unacceptable toxicity . This phase II , dose-finding , open label trial enrol woman newly diagnose EOC randomize receive one 3 dos LMWH dalteparin conjunction standard adjuvant taxane- platinum-based chemotherapy . The primary outcome disease response , measure accord Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup ( GCIG ) Cancer Antigen ( CA ) -125 response criterion . Secondary outcome include symptomatic venous thromboembolism , bleeding , compliance . The dose dalteparin associate best response test phase III randomize clinical trial patient population .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion consider enrolment : Women newly diagnose , histologically proven EOC potentially eligible . Patients primary peritoneal fallopian tube tumour equivalent histology also consider enrolment . If open true cut biopsy available , fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) show adenocarcinoma consider diagnostic EOC 4 ( ) follow condition satisfy : 1 . Patient pelvic mass , AND 2 . Any evidence disease large 1 cm upper abdomen ( unless prove stage IV ) , AND 3 . Normal mammography within 6 week randomization , AND 4 . Serum CA125/CEA great equal 25 . If ratio le 25 , barium enema ( colonoscopy ) gastroscopy ( radiological examination stomach ) must negative primary tumour . Between age 18 75 . FIGO stage IIB IV disease . A prestudy CA125 level least twice upper limit normal . Eligible standard adjuvant treatment taxane platinumbased chemotherapy meeting follow laboratory finding within 7 day prior randomization : 1 . Absolute granulocyte count least 1.5 x 10 9/L ( 1500 per cubic millimetre ) . 2 . Platelet count least 150 x 109/L ( 100,000 per cubic millimetre ) . 3 .

Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) level great 3 time upper limit normal local centre . Borderline ovarian tumour . Received prior chemotherapy radiation therapy EOC . Received mouse antibody anytime 28 day prior prestudy CA125 level . History another malignancy , unless diseasefree 5 year great ; nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma curatively treat carcinomainsitu cervix except . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance score 3 4 . Life expectancy le 12 week . Complete bowel obstruction time study enrolment . Receiving longterm anticoagulant therapy establish indication ( e.g. , atrial fibrillation , mechanical heart valve ) . Bleeding diathesis ( e.g. , evidence DIC , hereditary acquire bleed disorder ) . History allergy heparin ( e.g. , heparininduced thrombocytopenia ) . Significant cardiac history include myocardial infarction within precede 6 month , congestive heart failure , clinically relevant atrial ventricular arrhythmia , history 2nd 3rd degree heart block unless pacemaker implant . Serious medical condition preclude administration chemotherapy , anticoagulant therapy , adherence protocol , include exclusive : 1 . Allergic reaction drug contain cremophor compound chemically related taxanes platinum analogue . 2 . Significant neurologic psychiatric disorder would impair obtain informed consent reliable followup . 3 . Uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal medical therapy . 4 .
