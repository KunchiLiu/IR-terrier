	<brief_title>PPV : Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Streptococcus pneumonia lead cause pneumonia United States , estimate cause least 500,000 case annually 40,000 death . Interest expand pneumococcal vaccine administration arisen increase prevalence antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae , increase number people live chronic medical condition , age population . Extensive study vaccine response old person perform past 25 year . However , number issue hinder assessment vaccine response old people . Recent study indicate healthy old people develop initial antibody response vaccination similar young cohort , although antibody response serotypes may less . Limited data suggest functional antibody develop least initially vaccination old recipient . There publish report describe duration antibody response antibody function revaccination old patient . It difficult predict revaccination response , elevate pre-revaccination antibody , may response revaccination , even lower absolute antibody level . Accordingly , well-controlled revaccination protocol old patient define vaccine history know pre-revaccination antibody level study quantitative qualitative antibody response revaccination sorely need . The hypothesis study : 1 . Specific antipneumococcal antibody remain prevaccination level serum healthy old people ten year PPV . 2 . Healthy old people prompt robust vaccine response primary vaccination PPV . 3 . The existence antipneumococcal antibody healthy old people vaccinate PPV &gt; 5 year previously associate pronounced frequent adverse event reduce vaccine response rate . 4 . The effect advance age account reduce vaccine response . Volunteers Baltimore Longitudinal Study Aging ( BLSA ) ask participate retrospective/prospective analysis . Two pools participant recruit . The first group ( Group I ) 65 year old receive PPV five year earlier , second ( Group II ) decade gender match individual prior exposure PPV . These group match closely possible . All volunteer ( Groups I II ) receive vaccine . In one arm receive PPV ( group I revaccination group II primary vaccination ) . In arm receive Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine ( MPV ) ( primary vaccination group I II ) . Blood sample draw vaccination day 0 ( day vaccination ) , day 28 , 6 month follow vaccination . Approximately six month last vaccination participant ask complete brief medical history update , either telephone , mail , regularly schedule BLSA visit . This update continue perform every six month duration study .</detailed_description>
