	<brief_summary>Testosterone traditionally regard risk factor heart disease due fact male higher incidence disease woman , least menopause . However recent study show men low level testosterone may increase risk develop coronary heart disease ( furring blood vessel supply blood heart ) . Our group demonstrate relax effect testosterone isolate animal coronary artery ( blood vessel supply blood heart ) . We show short-term testosterone administration increase coronary artery brachial artery ( blood vessel arm ) blood flow decrease lack blood supply heart muscle men coronary artery disease . These finding indicate need similar longer-term study investigate possible beneficial effect longer-term testosterone therapy heart blood vessel . Should treatment show beneficial men coronary artery disease may useful additional therapy men furring artery heart result angina . Aim To investigate hypothesis testosterone beneficially affect myocardial perfusion , vascular reactivity , metabolic risk factor coronary heart disease improve quality life men low plasma testosterone level coronary heart disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main purpose project determine whether testosterone treatment number week beneficially affect myocardial perfusion , vascular reactivity , metabolic risk factor quality life men document coronary heart disease . Men document significant coronary artery disease positive exercise test myocardial ischaemia enrol study . They randomise active testosterone therapy ( 5 mg/day ) placebo 2 month . After 2 month undergo MRI perfusion scanning , radial artery applanation tonometry assess endothelial function , blood sample analysis metabolic risk factor coronary heart disease , complete quality life questionnaires cross-over opposite treatment . After 2 month period test repeat . Angina diaries kept duration study .</detailed_description>
