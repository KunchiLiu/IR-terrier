	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether E1 G1 safe effective treatment type 1 diabetes . Type 1 diabetes autoimmune disease , immune system attack pancreatic beta cell . These cell produce insulin , regulate blood glucose . The mainstay current treatment type 1 diabetes dietary control daily parenteral administration insulin . Recent diabetes research increasingly focus pancreatic islet cell replacement , either islet cell transplantation endogenous regeneration islet cell . During fetal development , islet precursor cell proliferate differentiate mature beta cell capable produce insulin . This process know islet cell neogenesis . Islet cell neogenesis normally cease around birth , however , adult pancreas still retain significant potential islet regeneration , show tissue repair follow pancreatic injury . Pre-clinical study show E1 G1 re-establish islet cell neogenesis increase pancreatic insulin production diabetic animal model . It therefore postulate treatment E1 G1 may produce islet cell regeneration type 1 diabetic patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Type 1 Diabetic Patients With Repeated Doses E1 Combination With G1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , 20 type 1 diabetic patient require insulin therapy randomize . Fifteen ( 15 ) patient randomize receive active study medication 5 patient randomized receive vehicle control . After undergo screening procedure , potential patient enter 14 day baseline phase baseline data collect . Pending successful completion baseline phase , patient enter 28-day treatment phase randomize receive either daily subcutaneous injection E1 plus G1 , separate injection daily subcutaneous injection vehicle control ( 2 separate injection ) . Patients receive daily dos morning breakfast period 28 day . Upon completion treatment , patient continue follow-up phase additional 6 month return clinic monthly visit . Throughout study , patient remain insulin regimen maintain diary record insulin intake blood glucose level . Pancreatic beta cell function insulin secretion best measure determination c-peptide ( co-secreted insulin 1:1 ratio ) . An arginine stimulate c-peptide test therefore perform frequent interval study . Patients injected solution contain arginine , normal constituent food increase insulin release beta cell blood . After injection seven blood sample c-peptide test collect 10 minute .</detailed_description>
