	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether E1 G1 safe effective treatment type 2 diabetes . Type 2 diabetes common form diabetes . The disease characterise insulin resistance compensate state hyperinsulinemia . In individual , hyperglycemia result failure pancreatic beta cell insulin secretory capacity adequately compensate insulin resistance peripheral tissue . Treatment type 2 diabetes achieve dietary control , combination diet oral hypoglycemic agent insulin . As disease progress , many type 2 diabetic patient eventually require insulin primary therapy achieve glycemic control . Recent diabetic research increasingly focus pancreatic islet cell replacement , either islet cell transplantation endogenous regeneration islet cell . During fetal development , islet precursor cell proliferate differentiate mature beta cell capable produce insulin . This process know islet cell neogenesis . Islet cell neogenesis normally cease around birth , however , adult pancreas still retain significant potential islet regeneration , show tissue repair follow pancreatic injury . Pre-clinical study show E1 G1 re-establish islet cell neogenesis increase insulin production diabetic animal model . In type 2 diabetic patient , treatment E1 G1 may result islet cell regeneration . This therapeutic approach may improve beta cell function , restore loss insulin secretory capacity also benefit patient oral hypoglycemic agent delay insulin use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Repeated Doses E1 Combination With G1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , 30 type 2 diabetic patient require oral hypoglycemic therapy Metformin and/or Thiazolidinedione randomize . Twenty ( 20 ) patient randomize receive active study medication 10 patient randomized receive vehicle control . After undergo screening procedure , potential patient enter 14 day baseline phase baseline data collect . Pending successful completion baseline phase , patient enter 28-day treatment phase randomize receive either daily subcutaneous injection E1 plus G1 , separate injection daily subcutaneous injection vehicle control ( 2 separate injection ) . Patients receive daily dos morning breakfast period 28 day . Upon completion treatment , patient continue follow-up phase additional 6 month return clinic monthly visit . Throughout study , patient remain current oral hypoglycemic therapy Metformin and/or Thiazolidinedione maintain diary record blood glucose level . The body 's ability control glucose assess oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . After overnight fast , patient ask drink solution contain know amount glucose . Blood sample glucose insulin measurement obtain patient drink glucose solution , 30 minute , 60 minute 2 hour glucose consume . This test perform frequent interval study .</detailed_description>
