	<brief_summary>Thrombocytopenia occur person 's blood decrease number platelet , cell involve blood clotting . This condition may lead uncontrolled bleeding fatal . Thrombocytopenia commonly occur hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection result standard HCV treatment . Anti-D antibody approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment HIV-related thrombocytopenia . The purpose study determine safety effectiveness intravenous anti-D treatment thrombocytopenia patient HCV infection start already undergoing treatment peginterferon alfa-2 ribavirin . This study recruit HCV patient without HIV co-infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peginterferon alfa-2 ribavirin current standard care treatment HCV infection ; however , severe hematologic effect , include anemia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , may make treatment less ideal patient HCV . Medications prevent treat serious neutropenia anemia establish commonly use . However , thrombocytopenia remain barrier effective treatment HCV infection patient . Developing effective treatment thrombocytopenia patient would decrease risk serious bleed event . It may also improve HCV treatment outcome prevent dose modification discontinuation peginterferon alfa-2 ribavirin due thrombocytopenia . Anti-D antibody Rh ( D ) antigen red blood cell . When anti-D attache Rh ( D ) antigen , immune-mediated destruction platelet prevent , help alleviate low platelet level people thrombocytopenia . This study investigate safety efficacy anti-D treatment thrombocytopenia HCV patient currently start standard HCV treatment . Both HIV infect uninfected participant recruit study . This study last 12 week . Participants study must either currently peginterferon alfa-2 ribavirin treatment initiate treatment start study ; two medication provide study . At study entry , participant give anti-D 30-minute infusion outpatient set . Participants observe adverse effect 1 hour postinfusion . Some participant may require additional dos anti-D later study , depend individual response drug ; participant may receive 1 6 dos anti-D. Efficacy anti-D treatment assess absolute change platelet count ability sustain plaletet count great 50,000 cells/microL study . Cytokine level also monitor gain insight anti-D may work cytokine platelet survival clearance . Generally , study visit occur study entry Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 . In patient require additional infusion anti-D , additional visit schedule additional infusion postinfusion visit occur 1 week infusion . All study visit include medication history blood collection . A clinical assessment target physical exam occur study entry , Weeks 1 12 , additional infusion postinfusion visit , applicable .</detailed_description>
