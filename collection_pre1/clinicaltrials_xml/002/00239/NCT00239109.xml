	<brief_summary>- Various study suggest patient treated Olanzapine experience substantial weight gain , change observe patient treat Ziprasidone . Negative consequence lipid glucose profile also observe patient treated Olanzapine . Most available data belong short-term study . However , clinical trial primary variable efficacy variable , include weight assessment secondary variable ; also lack systematic monitoring variable play role weight gain , level exercise , appetite increase , etc . consider importance inclusion protocol . Previous study ass visceral fat use widely standardize parameter waist index , certain level consider indicator cardiovascular risk , leptine , highly correlate body fat storage . We would like fit recently publish American Diabetes Association , American Psychiatric Association , American Association Clinical Endocrinologists North American Association Study Obesity Antipsychotic , obesity diabetes mellitus consensus.22 - Schizophrenic patient show 4-fold probability die consequence cardiovascular problem compare normal population . The antipsychotic treatment contribute increase risk favor weight gain appearance cardiovascular risk factor associate obesity ( blood hypertension , hyperlipidemia , type II Diabetes Mellitus ) . We intend obtain complete cardiovascular risk profile patient , well change antipsychotic treatment , include primary cardiovascular risk factor addition analysis marker recently link cardiovascular risk ( reactive protein C ) . - The study evaluate risk hyperglycemia , insulin resistance Diabetes Mellitus , investigate association glucose homeostasis abnormality weight gain treated patient . Likewise , adiponectine , secrete adipocytes possible link obesity insulin resistance determine ; recent study show adiponectine decrease human insulin resistance obesity ; furthermore , prospective study show change could predict high risk DM development . - Changes introduce complete evaluation patient 's metabolic cardiovascular profile advice , coordination endocrinologist complete review subject</brief_summary>
