	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial demonstrate fix dose combination telmisartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg ( T80/H25 ) superior reduce blood pressure eight week compare fix dose combination telmisartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg ( T80/H12.5 ) patient fail respond six week treatment T80/H12.5 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adult patient high blood pressure currently take one , two three blood pressure treatments ask take part study . It expect 1,600 patient seventeen country enter screen part study approximately 480 patient allocate double-blind randomise study treatment . The study last approximately fifteen week . Patients visit study doctor five time assessment . After informed consent , patient start screen period four ten day . During screen period , patient must take usual blood pressure treatment stop date next visit . If patient suitable study , start run-in treatment period telmisartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg ( T80/H12.5 ) take single tablet per day approximately six week . At end run-in treatment period , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) 90 mmHg , patient proceed blood pressure already control T80/H12.5 . If DBP 90 mmHg great start randomise study treatment period randomly allocate double-blind treatment either telmisartan 80 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg ( T80/H25 ) T80/H12.5 take single tablet per day eight week . They also receive placebo tablet ( dummy tablet contains active ingredient ) every day . They visit clinic four week eight week later assessment blood pressure general health . Their participation study complete eight week start randomise treatment period . Study Hypothesis : The trial hypothesis reduction seat trough DBP ( i.e. , seat trough DBP end randomise treatment period compare seat trough DBP start randomise treatment period ) great T80/H25 group compare T80/H12.5 group . Comparison ( ) : The efficacy safety two trial treatment ( T80/H25 versus T80/H12.5 ) compare . Trough blood pressure blood pressure 24 hour last dose trial medication .</detailed_description>
