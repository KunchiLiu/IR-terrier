	<brief_summary>In recent year , medical research cause progression heart disease due narrowing blockage blood vessel heart muscle improve understanding ischemic heart disease . It accept development later progression sudden blockage blood vessel associate inflammation , although remains unknown exactly trigger inflammatory process . It possible new blood test measure marker inflammation bloodstream may useful help identify patient risk heart damage assess response treatment . The study plan assess new blood test know marker inflammation ( IL-4 ) patient heart disease . The hypothesis study , cytokine , IL-4 , measure new assay , abnormally elevate blood patient coronary artery disease . Also hypothesize degree abnormality blood IL-4 , relate important clinical event patient , include severity disease , acute complication , treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single centre , prospective , non randomise , non control , pilot study potential abnormality new test group patient result postulate abnormal . The specific aim study : 1 . To measure IL-4 new rapid on-site technique patient document coronary artery disease present variety acute clinical circumstance 2 . To evaluate abnormal measurement relation severity disease , acute vascular complication newly prescribe medication . It propose study 4 small group patient ischemic heart disease . 1 . Patients unstable coronary artery disease admit Coronary Care Unit . They study admission daily coronary angiography perform . 2 . Patients coronary angioplasty . They study , immediately 24 hour procedure . 3 . Patients coronary artery bypass graft study immediately 24 hour post surgery . 4 . Patients stable coronary artery disease receive statin angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy study twice weekly commencement therapy 4 week .</detailed_description>
