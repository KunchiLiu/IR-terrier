	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess impact different feed solution patient breathe difficulty support breathing machine . The aim study determine high fat-low carbohydrate feeding reduces carbon dioxide production patient respiratory failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Nutritional Support Critically Ill Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients agree participate study fulfil inclusion criterion , randomise one two treatment group . 1 . Standard therapy group . Will receive high carbohydrate , low fat enteral feeding , ( 16.7 % protein , 30 % fat 53.3 % carbohydrate ) . The target rate determine treat physician dietician , minimum 5 day follow randomisation . 2 . Alternative therapy group receive high-fat , low carbohydrate enteral feeding , ( 16.7 % protein , 55.2 % fat 28.1 % carbohydrate . At target rate determine treat physician dietician , maximum 5 day follow randomisation . All patient receive enteral feeding continuous flow 24 hour day . The decision commence cease enteral feeding remain treat physician . The measurement VO2 , VCO2 , rest energy expenditure respiratory quotient wil make participant 12 hourly maximum 5 day use direct calorimeter . The indirect calorimeter connect expiratory outlet ventilator , collect analyze gas normally discharge atmosphere . The hypothesis study use high- fat , low-carbohydrate enteral feed , significantly reduce carbon dioxide production respiratory quotient critically ill , mechanically ventilated patient respiratory failure . Compared standard high-carbohydrate low-fat enteral feed .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult patient , 18 year older admit acute respiratory failure ( PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300 ) , need mechanical ventilation . Are expected require mechanical ventilation 48 hour . 2 . Patients receive enteral feeding via gastric postpyloric feeding tube . 3 . Patients nextofkin consent participate study . 1 . Patients age 18 year 2 . Patients contraindication enteral feed 3 . Patients receive total parental nutrition 4 . Patients already enrol another study may influence outcome study . 5 . Patients receive active medical management expect die within 24 hour time study entry . 6 . Patients diabetes mellitus , renal failure liver failure . 7 . Patients nextofkin consent participate study .</criteria>
