	<brief_summary>Breast cancer one common cancer seriously afflict woman United States . Of one million incident case report annually approximately 193,000 new case breast cancer ( Greenlee , 2001 ) . Although significant advance make early detection treatment breast cancer , impact reduction mortality modest ( Peta , 2000 ) . Furthermore , despite data implicate diet environmental risk factor , lifestyle change yet show significantly reduce risk breast cancer . Therefore , chemoprevention breast cancer worthwhile approach reduce incidence breast cancer . There every reason believe detail understanding initiation , promotion growth breast cancer ultimately provide rational strategy upon base prevention strategy . While pathway breast cancer development yet fully understood , role estrogen breast cancer etiology well establish . While many pathway involve breast cancer etiology , include loss tumor suppressor function p53 BRCA1 gain HER2 oncogene expression , exact role individual patient 's cancer development may vary . Therefore , may advantageous focus chemoprevention strategy may uniform impact breast cancer development , estrogen exposure . Estrogen metabolites , circulation locally synthesize breast , important pathogenesis breast cancer . High level circulate estrogen postmenopausal woman associate increased risk breast cancer ( Clemons , 2001 ) . Furthermore , local estrogen synthesis , i.e . aromatase activity , breast may also important development breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : We hypothesize proliferative marker Ki-67 reduce patient preinvasive Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ( DCIS ) early breast cancer treat anastrozole . To establish reduction Ki-67 primary surrogate endpoint breast cancer risk reduction patient treat anastrozole measure Ki-67 treatment anastrozole . Consistent , demonstrate Geisler et al patient advance breast cancer show decrease Ki-67 lumpectomy/mastectomy sample anastrozole administer week prior definitive surgery . In addition , trend profound suppression achieve objective response . Ki-67 measure routine immunohistochemistry . Specific Aim 2 : We hypothesize histopathological tumor response demonstrate 30-40 percent patient preinvasive ( DCIS ) early invasive ( less 2 cm ) breast cancer treat anastrozole . The percent ability reverse early breast cancer lesion patient treat anastrozole qualified secondary surrogate endpoint breast cancer risk reduction . Consistent , demonstrate 30-40 percent patient advance breast cancer show infiltration foamy macrophage fibrosis lumpectomy/mastectomy sample chemotherapy administered month prior definitive surgery . Further , trend profound change achieve complete clinical response . Importantly , complete pathological response advance breast cancer show correlate improve disease free survival overall survival breast cancer patient . A corollary reversibility early carcinogenic lesion reliably demonstrate present proposal , would translate chemoprevention breast cancer . Specific Aim 3 : To compare pretreatment MRI post treatment MRI ( secondary surrogate endpoint breast cancer risk reduction ) . We hypothesize tumor response measure contrast washout characteristic patient preinvasive early breast cancer treat aromatase inhibitor . Consistent , previously demonstrate patient advanced breast cancer show reduction vascularity response chemotherapy . Further , trend profound suppression achieve pathological response lumpectomy/mastectomy specimen . Specific Aim 4 : To compare pretreatment marker angiogenesis post treatment marker angiogenesis ( secondary surrogate endpoint breast cancer risk reduction ) . We hypothesize tumor response measure reduction CD31 ( microvessel count ) , CD105 ( endoglin ) VEGF response hormonal therapy . There may upregulation TSP-1 , angiogenesis inhibitor response anastrozole . Angiogenic activity report ligand nuclear hormone receptor superfamily estrogens . Inhibition proangiogenic effect estrogen could underlie chemopreventive action hormone modulators mammary carcinogenesis . A group investigator indeed coin word angioprevention mechanism chemoprevention reverse angiogenic switch preinvasive invasive cancer . Additionally , demonstrate patient various cancer whose tumor vascularity target VEGF inhibitor show high response patient treat chemotherapy alone . Our present proposal capitalize data obtain advanced breast cancer efficacy antiangiogenesis mechanism option treatment prevention .</detailed_description>
