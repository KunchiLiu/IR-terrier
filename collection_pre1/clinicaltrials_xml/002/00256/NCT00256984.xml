	<detailed_description>Rectocele rectal intussusception frequent finding woman often asymptomatic apart anatomical defect , see vaginal examination . They associate , however , refractory constipation may best described term `` Outlet Obstruction '' `` Obstructive Defecation Syndrome ( ODS ) '' . ODS characterize symptom complex , include feel incomplete evacuation associate need strain excessively external assistance ( digital , mechanical positional maneuver , enemas suppository ) aid defecation . Abdominal rectal pain also common complaint . Obstetric trauma also recognize contribute factor . However , none symptoms/factors single pathognomonic problem .

The impact clinical study evaluate technique limit variability result lack comparators . Recently , new surgical approach develop Italian surgeon , A. Longo , evaluate several European center . These early study observation indicate new procedure may fact provide significantly good symptom resolution ODS patient available treatment , warrant study .
