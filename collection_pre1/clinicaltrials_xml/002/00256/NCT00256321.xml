	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer second common neoplasm world . Early diagnosis surgical resection improve survival chance cure . Unfortunately , majority case diagnose advanced stage , 20 % patient present localized disease . The five-year survival gastric cancer stage remain dismal 8 % . Chemotherapy use advanced gastric cancer unsatisfactory result . Therefore , new approach need patient . Among new chemotherapy regimen advance gastric cancer include combination oral 5FU-based compound call Capecitabine ( Xeloda ) Oxaliplatin . A phase II study suggest combination regimen active overall response rate range 30-40 % . Several preclinical clinical study show expression cyclooxygenase enzyme II ( COX-2 ) upregulated many pre-neoplastic neoplastic lesion . Furthermore , appear association overexpression Cox-2 invasiveness cancer prognosis . Finally , preclinical clinical study suggest selective Cox-2 inhibitor induce apoptosis gastric cancer cell retard tumor progression . Therefore , strong rationale combination selective Cox-2 inhibitor , Celecoxib , Capecitabine Oxaliplatin therapeutic phase II trial patient advance recurrent gastric cancer .</brief_summary>
