	<brief_title>Efficacy Lapaquistat Acetate Simvastatin Subjects With Primary Dyslipidemia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In human , cholesterol acquire dietary source produce de novo liver , intestine , various tissue . Normally , balance among cholesterol synthesis , dietary intake , degradation adequate maintain healthy cholesterol plasma level ; however , subject hypercholesterolemia , elevation low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lead atherosclerotic deposition cholesterol arterial wall ( atherosclerosis ) subsequent coronary heart disease . Thus , establish lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentration effectively reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Additional lipid risk factor coronary heart disease include elevate triglyceride , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level , low level high-density lipoprotein cholesterol . Despite change lifestyle availability potent lipid-lowering agent , cardiovascular disease continue major cause death Western Europe North America . Serum cholesterol level exceed 5 mmol/L ( 193 mg/dL ) common adult Britain much Europe , United States , Australia , New Zealand , represent serious public health concern . Currently , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( ie , statin ) first-line monotherapies prescribe treatment dyslipidemia , diet therapeutic lifestyle change alone fail reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol desire level . Statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol triglyceride , increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , improve endothelial function . Treatment statins reduces risk vascular event 30 % subject without symptoms arteriosclerosis ; however , many subject fail reach recommended level low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction receive low-dose statin monotherapy . Consequently , dosage statin often increase additional treatment add ; latter become important therapeutic option achieve increasingly stringent lipid target set forth international therapeutic guideline . Simvastatin , long-established treatment dyslipidemia monotherapy combination drug , lactone , hydrolyze , inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase . At molecular level , rate synthesis cholesterol depend primarily highly regulated activity 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase . TAK-475 ( lapaquistat acetate ) squalene synthase inhibitor currently development Takeda treatment dyslipidemia . This study evaluate efficacy safety lapaquistat acetate take simvastatin subject hypercholesterolemia . Total participation time study expect 24 week .</detailed_description>
