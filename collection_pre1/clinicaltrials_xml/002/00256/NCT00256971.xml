	<brief_summary>The important role meniscus knee function preserve knee health show several study . Additionally principal function load transmission shock absorption , meniscus contributes knee joint proprioception probably also joint stability.Study affect meniscus injury balance posture previously published.Surgical practice increasingly aim minimal resection injure tissue , preserve stable meniscal remnant much function possible.The purpose study determine whether meniscus surgery effect relatively new postural control measure , correlation functional balance assessment . The second purpose establish affect different type menisci surgery balance impairment ( meniscectomy v tear repair ) , correlation long-term outcome .</brief_summary>
