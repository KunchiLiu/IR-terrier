	<brief_summary>The combination oxaliplatin gemcitabine highly active wide variety tumor include pancreatic , germ cell , breast , biliary , mesothelioma ( Mitchell et al , 2002 ) , lung . In last study utilize day 1 8 gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 day 1 8 oxaliplatin 65 mg/m2 poor prognosis lung cancer patient ( PS 1-3 ) response rate 16 % incidence febrile neutropenia . Toxicity crucial consideration design regimen intend palliation . Toxicities associate cisplatin make difficult use patient Head Neck Cancer ( HNC ) , many elderly comorbidities . In addition , many patient metastatic HNC previously receive cisplatin neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy , part primary chemoradiation treatment . When patient recur , possible tumor innate acquire cisplatin resistance . Oxaliplatin likely well tolerate cisplatin contain regimen , especially regards neurotoxicity . Gemcitabine show promising activity single agent combination chemotherapy first line treatment patient HNC . A combination chemotherapy regimen use oxaliplatin gemcitabine administer every week logical worth explore patient metastatic recurrent head neck cancer improve toxicity profile patient monitoring maintain efficacy chemotherapy regimen .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patient must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma head neck region . Primary tumor site include : lip , oral cavity , pharynx ( oropharynx , hypopharynx ) , larynx ( supraglottis , glottis , subglottis ) . For nasopharynx primary , squamous histologic subtypes allow ( WHO typeI keratinizing , WHO typeII nonkeratinizing , WHO typeIII undifferentiated ) . Patients must metastatic locally recurrent carcinoma head neck . Patients locoregional disease must consider incurable mean locoregional therapy . All sit disease must assess designate measurable nonmeasurable disease document CT , MRI , Xray physical exam nuclear exam . All measurable disease must assess within 28 day prior registration . All nonmeasurable disease must assess within 42 day prior registration . Patients may receive prior radiotherapy complete recovery radiationinduced toxicity . At least 4 week must elapse completion radiation therapy time registration . If lesion within radiation port use assess response therapy , lesion must demonstrate clear progression follow completion radiation therapy . Patients must adequate bone marrow reserve document absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,500 microliters platelet &gt; 100,000/microliter obtain within 14 day prior registration . Patients must adequate hepatic document serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal . Serum transaminase ( SGOT SGPT ) must &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal serum unless liver involved tumor , case serum transaminase ( SGOT SGPT ) must &lt; 5 x institutional limit normal . These test must obtain within 14 day prior registration . Patients must creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal creatinine clearance &gt; 30 cc/min calculate use follow formula obtain within 28 day prior registration . Calculated Creatinine Clearance = ( 140age ) X wt ( kg ) X ( 0.85 female ) 72 X creatinine ( mg/dl ) These test must perform within 28 day prior registration . All patient must 18 year age old Patients must Zubrod performance 02 Patients must one prior chemotherapy regimen recurrent/metastatic disease . Patients initial locally advanced nonmetastatic disease allow one prior chemotherapy regimen part primary curative therapy . All chemotherapy must complete 4 week prior registration . Any number prior biologic therapy ( e.g . chimeric antibody kinase inhibitor ) permit part chemotherapy regimen . Patients must surgical treatment procedure head neck cancer within 4 week prior registration . Surgical procedure biopsy purpose alone allow within 28 day prior registration . Patients must completely recover surgery prior registration . Patients must prior therapy oxaliplatin gemcitabine Patients evidence active uncontrolled infection , recent myocardial infection , unstable angina , life threaten arrhythmia eligible . Patients severe psychiatric disorder eligible . Patients know brain metastasis eligible . However , brainimaging study require eligibility patient neurological sign symptom . If brainimaging study perform , must negative disease . No prior malignancy allow except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient complete remission , malignancy patient diseasefree 5 year .</criteria>
