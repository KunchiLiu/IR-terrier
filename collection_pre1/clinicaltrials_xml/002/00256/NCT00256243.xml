	<brief_summary>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy , also term primary , induction , preoperative chemotherapy , define chemotherapy administer locoregional treatment . It first use locally advanced breast cancer 30 year ago . Classically , tumor treat radical surgery and/or radiotherapy . However , despite aggressive local therapy , patient relapse distant metastasis eventually die . The aim neoadjuvant therapy reduce tumor volume patient surgical resection , thus increase likelihood breast conservation . More recently , neoadjuvant therapy study way test relevance biological marker predict disease outcome . At least six randomized trial compare survival patient manage either neoadjuvant adjuvant approach . Two small trial suggest survival advantage patient treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Other study , include large trial ( 1,523 patient ) run NSABP , find difference disease-free overall survival . Induction Microscopic path clinical response ( pCR ) one primary goal neoadjuvant therapy patient evidence tumor cell breast lymph node treatment may longer disease-free overall survival . Biweekly weekly regimen may enhance dose intensity minimize re-growth cell cycle treatment . In fact , dose dense regimen even show survival benefit adjuvant set lymph node positive breast cancer , make possible use granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) . There yet standard best neoadjuvant treatment . Generally patient receive AC ( NSABP 14 ) 3-weekly regimen neoadjuvant set . In addition , incorporation taxanes 3 weekly schedule result statistically high pathological clinical response ( CR ) . More recently , weekly paclitaxel regimen report increased pathological response compare 3 weekly taxane regimen . Carboplatin also emerge effective agent treatment metastatic breast cancer . Moreover , combination carboplatin paclitaxel find synergistic three-weekly regimen weekly regimen . In fact , combination carboplatin , paclitaxel herceptin demonstrate survival advantage paclitaxel herceptin alone . The Phase III study , preliminary result present San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium , show addition carboplatin herceptin paclitaxel result six-month improvement time take disease progress , compare standard herceptin paclitaxel regimen . The study find median survival herceptin paclitaxel arm 33.5 month , group receive tripartite therapy yet reach point 36 month follow-up . Furthermore , weekly regimen drug find significantly improve tolerability three weekly regimen . Therefore , propose use 4 cycle AC q 2 week , use dose dense adjuvant study Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) support day 3-9 cycle . After completion AC plan administer paclitaxel carboplatin weekly total 12 dos one week rest every 3 week treatment 12 week . Patients her-2 overexpressors FISH also receive Trastuzumab weekly carboplatin paclitaxel combination TC±H find synergistic advanced breast cancer improve clinical outcome . In separate trial , GM-CSF use breast cancer patient treat adriamycin base chemotherapy preferred growth factor neoadjuvant setting . The initial result suggestive improved survival breast cancer patient give 6 versus 5 versus 4 cycle chemotherapy GM-CSF support . Higher dendritic cell ( DC ) traffic show trend toward improved survival . Moreover , intrapatient comparison treatment show percentage S100+ DC significantly increase course GM-CSF treatment . The result form basis current hypothesis primary tumor may vivo antigenic stimulus dendritic cell trafficking , combination prolong neoadjuvant chemotherapy GM-CSF induce immune enhancement may contribute good tumor control well survival .</brief_summary>
