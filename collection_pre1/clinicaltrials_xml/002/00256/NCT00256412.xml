	<detailed_description>Primary aim Aim 1 : To determine whether measure essential fatty acid ( EFA ) membrane composition predict symptom improvement selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) treatment major depressive disorder . Aim 2 : To determine whether augmentation EFA eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) likely benefit patient inadequate improvement follow four week SSRI monotherapy . Aim 3 : To determine degree improvement follow omega-3 supplementation SSRI partial responder reflect change erythrocyte concentration EPA DHA ratio EPA arachidonic acid ( AA ) erythrocyte concentration . Secondary Aim : To determine whether relationship change tissue EFA concentration change depressive symptom follow omega-3 supplementation mediate change cytokine activity . Primary Hypotheses : Hypothesis 1 : After four week treatment SSRI escitalopram Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) score correlate positively baseline RBC concentration EPA DHA negatively baseline erythrocyte ratio AA EPA . Hypothesis 2 : Among patient continue meet criterion MDD four week treatment , randomize .7 gram randomize 1.5 gram daily EPA supplementation show great mean improvement MADRS score additional six week assign placebo supplementation . Hypothesis 3 : After patient inadequate antidepressant response SSRI treatment complete six week augmentation placebo , .7 grams 1.5 gram per day EPA , relationship exist final MADRS score final RBC concentration DHA EPA final RBC ratio AA EPA . These relationship resemble baseline RBC concentration subsequent response escitalopram suggest therapeutic range concentration . Secondary Hypothesis : Among patient erythrocyte EPA concentration less 0.82 % begin augmentation trial , association subsequent change depressive symptom EPA tissue concentration markedly reduce introduction change IL-1 beta , IL-10 PGE2 model . Study Design : Phase one four-week open trial design test specific response predictor . A subset subject complete phase one enter phase two , six-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial design show whether eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) effective augmentation agent patient inadequate antidepressant response . A pilot thirty ( 30 ) subject , age 18-55 year , current major depressive disorder take regularly take antidepressant previous month . Cognitively impaired subject include . This pilot study design demonstrate feasibility NIMH application . It currently power statistically test list hypothesis . Study outcomes/endpoints : The primary outcome phase final MADRS score . Study Procedures : Subjects recruit advertisement University Iowa Hospitals Clinics ( UIHC ) adult clinic . Advertisements also place newspaper city within 100-mile radius UIHC . Screening procedure : The study 's research associate screen call , contact respondent , administer screen determine eligibility . Those appear satisfy entry criterion give appointment meet PI Co-PI . If in-person evaluation confirms subject 's eligibility , give consent form invite ask remain question might . The protocol could begin visit . Study Intervention : Active study agent : Escitalopram eicosupentaenoic acid ( EPA ) . A variety antidepressants available treatment Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . A number psychotherapeutic approach also demonstrate effectiveness . Potential subject could receive escitalopram EPA without participate study . Placebo study agent : Placebo capsule match EPA capsule . Storage : Drug lock maintained medical education building . Data form computerize data store University Iowa Medical Education Building . Offices cabinet lock , computer file password protect . The lab Arthur Spector , M.D . analyze blood sample . Administration : In phase one , subject give 4 week supply 10 mg escitalopram ( Lexapro ) instruct take one pill day 4 week . If eligible phase 2 study , subject continue take 10 mg escitalopram also randomly assign take , addition , either 0.7 gram 1.5grams EPA placebo . ** If depression symptom improve great 50 % end week 4 , subject give 1 month supply escitalopram assist obtain psychiatric care area . If depression symptom improve great 50 % end week 4 subject invite participate Phase 2 study . The protocol begin administration structure diagnostic interview , Structured Clinical Interview DSM IV Diagnosis ( SCID ) , two depression rating scale , Montgomery Asburg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) Hamilton Rating Scale ( HRS ) . Two tubes blood drawn , one erythrocyte EFA concentration determination quantification inflammatory marker ( c-reactive protein ) . Subjects supply one-month supply escitalopram ( Lexapro ) instruction take one 10mg capsule morning . Return visit two week four week schedule subject instructed return remain medication . Subjects contact weekly interval . During brief telephone conversation ask whether subject question experience troublesome side effect . Those meet criterion inadequate escitalopram response describe invited participate six-week trial supplemental omega-3 . Subjects continue take escitalopram previous dose 10mg daily randomly assign take , addition , either 0.7 gram 1.5 gram eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) placebo . Visits phase 2 schedule week 6 , 8 , 10 . At week 4 10 blood sample erythrocyte EFA concentration cytokine determination draw . MADRS rat visit .</detailed_description>
