	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : Hypothesis The novel CVRF include select indicator artery wall injury local systemic inflammation , relate presence development atherosclerosis macrovascular event DM type 2 . 2.Intensive glucose lower therapy reduce level several , , novel CVRF . Secondary Hypotheses : Primary Outcomes : 1 . MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION : Myocardial infarction ( MI ) determine base algorithm supplied end appendix . All suspect MI evaluate detail Endpoints Committee . All support documentation , i.e. , ECGs , hospital record , laboratory value , etc . need confirm rule presence absence MI obtain personnel ECG Laboratory . 2 . CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE : Diagnosis new congestive heart failure ( CHF ) make presence least two minor manifestation new onset pulmonary congestion require treatment . Treatment diuretic , digitalis glycoside , ACE inhibitor , hospitalization management symptom CHF would appropriate . Study Abstract : Objectives A predominant consequence diabetes mellitus ( DM ) type 2 accelerate development atherosclerosis related condition . Conventional cardiovascular risk factor explain portion excess risk atherosclerosis population . In vitro , animal epidemiologic study suggest variety `` novel '' cardiovascular risk factor ( CVRF ) , include triglyceride-rich lipoprotein ( TGRL ) , small dense low density lipoprotein ( D-LDL ) subfractions , oxidative stress , advanced glycation endproduct ( AGE ) formation may contribute development atherosclerosis . These risk factor may also induce endothelial cell activation/injury local systemic inflammation cause elevation plasma level additional novel risk factor , soluble adhesion molecule , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) , fibrinogen C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . Many risk factor increase DM type 2 , presumably consequence hyperglycemia insulin resistance . However , study evaluate singular synergistic relationship novel ( CVRF ) measure atherosclerosis well development clinical macrovascular event individual diabetes . If , suspect , novel CVRF relate development atherosclerosis macrovascular disease , critical future design prevention strategy know whether intensive glucose lower significantly reduce level novel CVRF . Furthermore , would important explore whether relationship novel risk factor atherosclerosis development clinical event attenuate individual receive glucose lower therapy .

The investigator proposes take advantage study population framework recently approve VA Cooperative Study `` Glycemic Control Complications Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 '' address issue efficient cost-effective manner . Hypothesis 1 . The novel CVRF ( outline Table 1 ) , include select indicator artery wall injury local systemic inflammation , relate presence development atherosclerosis macrovascular event DM type 2 . 2 . Intensive glucose lower therapy reduce level several , , novel CVRF . Research Plan Specific objectives 1 &amp; 2 : Cross-sectional observational objective 1 . Determine cross-sectional relationship baseline level novel CVRF presence atherosclerosis assess electron beam compute tomography measurement ( EBCT ) coronary artery calcium ( CAC ) abdominal aortic calcium ( AAC ) . 2 . Determine cross-sectional relationship baseline level novel CVRF prevalence clinical macrovascular disease . Specific objective 3 : Prospective interventional objective Determine whether intensive glucose lower reduces level novel CVRF . Future long-term specific objective : Prospective observational objective 1 . Determine ability baseline level , `` trial '' level , change level novel CVRF predict progression atherosclerosis . 2 . Determine ability baseline level , `` trial '' level , change level novel CVRF predict clinical macrovascular event . Results 89 cardiovascular event occur median follow-up duration 5.2 year . Although intensive glucose lower therapy significantly reduce cardiovascular event substudy cohort whole , evidence response modify baseline CAC indicate significant p-values treatment log ( CAC+1 ) interaction term unadjusted multivariable adjusted model ( 0.01 0.03 , respectively ) . Multivariable adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) effect treatment indicate progressive diminution benefit increase CAC . Subgroup analyse also conduct clinically relevant CAC category , Coronary Calcium score ( Agatston score ) 100 . For subgroup CAC &gt; 100 , 11 62 individual event , 1 52 individual CAC 100 suffer event . The multivariable HR intensive treatment CAC &gt; 100 0.74 ( 0.46-1.20 , p=0.21 ) , subgroup CAC 100 , correspond HR 0.08 ( 0.008- 0.77 , p=0.03 ) , event rate 39 4 per 1000 person-years , respectively .
