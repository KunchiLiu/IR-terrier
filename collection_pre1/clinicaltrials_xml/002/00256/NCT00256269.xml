	<brief_summary>The combination cisplatin irinotecan significant anti-tumor activity esophageal cancer . Oxaliplatin show activity combination 5 FU radiation treatment locally advanced esophageal cancer . Oxaliplatin also well side effect profile cisplatin may able overcome tumor develop cisplatin resistance . The standard treatment locally advanced esophageal cancer cisplatin , 5FU radiation follow possible esophagectomy . However , large portion patient relapse tumor may develop resistance cisplatin and/or cumulative toxicity previous treatment forbids use cisplatin . Weekly combination oxaliplatin irinotecan show active well tolerate elderly population refractory colorectal cancer . Therefore , propose phase II trial weekly oxaliplatin irinotecan test effectiveness tolerability regimen metastatic and/or recurrent esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
