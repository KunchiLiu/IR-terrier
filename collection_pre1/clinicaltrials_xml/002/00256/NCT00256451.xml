	<detailed_description>We propose test degree specific genetic marker alter relationship subjective objective measure response alcohol ingestion among non-alcohol dependent adult African descent laboratory environment . To meet aim , non-alcohol dependent adult African descent recruit participation meet N-goal 40 trial completers . After consent , genotyping , complete baseline assessment , participate four separate alcohol challenge session separate least 10 day . During session , subject administer alcohol sham drinking challenge session pretreatment either naltrexone ( 50 mg/day ) placebo double-blind fashion . The order four session randomly assign . During session , physiological subjective response measure . We select subject assure equal number participant least one copy Val6 allele compare homozygous Ala6 allele .</detailed_description>
