	<brief_summary>Oxaliplatin-containing regimen safely successfully use combination concurrent radiation treatment solid tumor rectal esophageal cancer . The Lyon R0-04 phase II trial utilized combination Oxaliplatin , infusional 5FU radiation treatment rectal cancer . A total 40 operable subject enter onto study . Radiotherapy deliver A three-field technique dose 50 Gy ( total dose ) 5 week concomitant boost approach . Two cycle chemotherapy give synchronously week 1 5 , Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 day 1 follow continuous infusion fluorouracil 350 mg/mg2 L-folinic acid 100mg/m2 5 day . Surgery plan 5 week later . All subject complete treatment without modification except one experience grade 3-4 toxicity . Grade 3 toxicity see seven subject . Surgery perform subject mean interval time 5 week . An objective clinical response see 30 subject ( 75 % ) . Sphincter-saving surgery possible 26 subject . No postoperative death occur . In four subject ( 10 % ) , reoperation necessary ( anastomotic fistula , n=2 ; pelvic abscess , n=2 ) . In six case operative specimen sterilize ( 15 % ) , 12 case ( 30 % ) , residual cell detect . Such combined preoperative chemoradiotherapy Oxaliplatin-containing regimen well tolerated increase surgical toxicity . The good response rate observe warrant use clinical trial . The combination oxaliplatin , 5FU , radiation also use Phase I/II trial esophageal cancer . In particular trial , eligibility include therapeutically naïve esophageal cancer subject clinical disease stage II IV . Initial dos schedule cycle 1 consist Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 day 1 , 15 , 29 ; continuous infusion 5-FU 180 mg/m2 24 hour 35 day ; RT 1.8 Gy 28 fraction start day 8 . At completion cycle 1 , eligible subject could undergo operation begin cycle 2 without RT . Postoperative subject eligible cycle 2 . Stage IV subject allow three cycle absence disease progression . 38 subject treat ( 22 stage IV , 16 stage II-III ) . 38 eligible subject receive therapy : 22 non-invasively stag IV 16 non-invasively stag IV 16 non-invasively staged II III . 36 subject complete cycle 1 , 29 subject start cycle 2 , 24 subject complete cycle 2 . The combined-modality therapy well tolerate , dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) prevent Oxaliplatin 5-FU escalation . No grade 4 hematologic toxicity note . Eleven grade 3 two grade 4 clinical toxicity note eight subject . After cycle 1 , 29 subject ( 81 % ) cancer esophageal mucosa . 13 subject underwent operation intent resect esophagus 5 subject ( 38 % ) exhibit pathologic complete response . There surgical mortality . Only 1 subject develop post-operative tracheosphageal fistula . The result trial describe indicated combination oxaliplatin radiation safe efficacious dose compromise surgical wound healing , repair clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
