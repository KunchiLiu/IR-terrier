	<brief_summary>Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) one prevalent musculoskeletal complaint worldwide , affect 30-40 % population age 65 yr.Individuals knee OA suffer progressive loss function.Balance integral component many activity daily live . Individuals knee OA display impairment postural control , mostly dynamic test condition . Total knee replacement ( TKR ) establish place treatment knee osteoarthritis consider effective intervention.It remain unknown whether TKR impact significantly balance state patient OA whether improve functional ability TKR correlate balance control ability population.The purpose study determine whether TKR effect relatively new postural control measure use force platform system - Balance master , correlation functional balance assessment . Methods : Participants During year prospective study plan recruit 150 participant symptomatic OA knee , hospitalize orthopedic department Hadassah Hospital primary TKR . Participants undergo evaluation surgery year after.They ask perform Balance Master measurement , ambulation balance test . Additional information collect questionnaire physical examination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Static Dynamic Balance Correlation With Quality Life , Primary Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Balance Master Testing The Pro Balance Master system software version 8 use study . The Pro Balance Master system comprise two 23cm × 46cm dual force plate connect midline anterioposterior axis pin joint . Each force plate mount pair symmetrically position force transducer . The four transducer measure vertical ground reaction force , form basis subsequent calculation center pressure ( COP ) center gravity ( COG ) sway angel . All test data acquire stored PC . Subjects instruct remove shoe step onto forceplates , cover trace paper . Their foot position align lateral border foot appropriate height line mark forceplates ( ie , short , 76 140 cm ; medium , 141 165cm ; tail , 166 203cm ) . The medial maileoli align transverse forceplate line subject adopt comfortable amount forefoot splay . The outline foot trace onto paper ensure placement subsequent testing session . The visual display monitor adjust subject 's eye level . Subjects instruct move foot ask stand arm side throughout test procedure . The standard test suite protocol administer , consist 6 test , 3 static 3 dynamic . The static test require subject look straight ahead stand still possible , initially eye open , eye close , finally focus display monitor use visual feedback maintain position cursor ( represent subject 's COG ) within centrally position target box . For test , data relate postural sway record period 20 second area sway calculate expressed percentage subject 's theoretical limit stability ( LOS ) . Assuming movement ankle ( fixed foot position ) resemble inverted pendulum , limit define extend 6.25 ° anteriorly , 4.45 ° posteriorly , 8.00 ° side , ~2 delimit area COG safely move without change base support . All three dynamic test require subject shift COG . The first dynamic test involve rhythmic weight shift side side 50 % LOS 3-second 2-second pacing . Subjects instruct match timing movement bail screen shift body weight side side target line denote screen . The second test similar first except movement anterioposterior direction . Data reflect average magnitude movement path ( express percentage LOS ) produce six trial pace movement direction . The absolute error relative target ( set 50 % LOS ) calculate subtract 50 score obtain ( 50 % indicate perfect execution ) record absolute term . The final dynamic test involve weight shift 8 target position ellipse , perimeter correspond 75 % LOS . The subject require follow ball target highlight , remain target 3 second return central target ( neutral ) . Targets highlight random order , target select . The maximum allowable movement time reach target 8 second . The average movement time path sway ( term percentage LOS ) determine across target . A score 100 % indicated path deviation occur , ie , perfect execution . ( It note process data produce outcome measure describe hard coded NeuroCom.ª ) Main Outcome Measures : Oxford Knee Score ( OKS ) . The OKS self-completed patient base outcome score . It 12 item self-completed patient base outcome score . The questionnaire develop patient interview validate two generic health scale , SF-36 Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) [ 44 ] . It originally intend use large randomise controlled trial patient undergo total knee replacement , ass level , change , pain function knee solely patient 's viewpoint . Data collection via postal questionnaire direct interview . Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) .The severity knee pain evaluate VAS [ 45 ] patient remain weight-bearing position ( walk stand ) 5 minute parallel bar . The VAS instrument consist horizontal line 10cm long , anchor point 0 ( pain ) 10 ( maximum pain ) . Four Square Step Test ( FSST ) . FSST clinical measure rapid step obstacle avoidance . The equipment require FSST include stopwatch 4 cane . The square form use 4 cane rest flat floor . Canes 90cm long , direction type handle use important . The subject stand square number 1 face square number 2 . The aim step fast possible square follow sequence . Square number 2 , 3 , 4 , 1 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . This sequence require subject step forward , backward , sideway right left . The score record time take complete sequence . The stopwatch start first foot contact floor square 2 finish last foot come back touch floor square 1 . The following instruction give subject , `` Try complete sequence fast possible without touch stick . Both foot must make contact floor square . If possible , face forward entire sequence . '' The sequence show subject . One practice trial complete ensure subject know sequence . Two FSST complete best time take score . A trial repeat subject fails complete sequence successfully , lose balance , make contact cane sequence . Subjects unable face forward entire sequence need turn step next square still give score . All subject wore prefer shoe . The examiner stand position see step take subject , assistant provide subject close supervision . The entire test , include give instruction practice trial , take less 5 minute complete . Time Up Go test ( TUG ) . Subjects require stand chair armrest , walk 3m , turn around , return chair , sit . The time take complete task measure second stopwatch [ 47 ] . The TUG test show high degree test-retest reliability TUG score elderly subject . SF-36 . This 36-item questionnaire measure health function eight scale , include physical functioning scale , among widely use measure quality life study patient population .Missing data score procedure follow SF-36 user guideline .</detailed_description>
