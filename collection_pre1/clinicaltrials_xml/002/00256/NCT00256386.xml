	<brief_title>LabAlert : Enhancing Medication Safety Through Electronic Interventions Improve Laboratory Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many medication clinician prescribe prevent treat disease result unanticipated unintended toxic effect . Many national clinical guideline recommend baseline periodic laboratory monitoring avoid adverse drug event . Our Safety Prescribing project ( SIP ) find many significant gap medication safety . Lab Alert evaluate electronic tool improve Kaiser Permanente 's performance laboratory monitoring avoid adverse drug event . We enroll patient take high-risk medication receive laboratory monitoring . The primary outcome 2-year study proportion patient receive guideline-based laboratory monitoring 1 3 week post-intervention . Fifteen primary care clinic randomly assign : ( 1 ) usual care ( UC ) ( 2 ) electronic message reminder ( EMR ) ( 3 ) automate voice message ( AVM ) ( 4 ) pharmacy outreach team ( Pharmacy ) . The reminder notify patient 's need guideline-specified laboratory test due medication use . Using electronic data , patient PCPs assign intervention clinic study-specified medication identify screened exclusion , yield 600 patient ( 200 per intervention group ) . Patients assign treatment group basis condition assign usual clinic . After intervention observation period , use time frame inclusion exclusion criterion use identify patient intervention arm , retrospectively identify comparison 200-patient cohort usual care clinic . Thus , approximately 800 patient include study . Baseline , follow-up , outcome data obtain electronic record . Study-defined medication finalize study team quality committee . These medication identify base upon previous work prescribe reasonable frequency , commonly gap laboratory monitoring , carry significant risk toxicity , interest participate HMOs prior potential adverse event . We anticipate focus baseline monitor new prescription . New start define patient index prescription dispense medication prior 6 month . Lab Alert assess effectiveness patient-specific electronic medical record ( EMR ) in-basket reminder primary care provider ( PCP ) ( EMR reminder ) , automate recorded voice message patient ( AVM ) , pharmacy team outreach ( Pharmacy ) increase proportion patient receive guideline-based laboratory monitoring , compare usual care ( UC ) . If intervention well UC , Lab Alert ass compare effectiveness cost . The study also evaluate PCP patient experience intervention order refine intervention future .</detailed_description>
