	<brief_summary>The study design subject whose cancer advance therefore operated goal completely remove cancer . At stage disease , subject cured disease , however , treatment help subject live longer well keep cancer control . All treatment offer primarily pursue goal . Subjects stage disease traditionally receive radiation therapy chemotherapy , treatment succession concurrently . Recently , administration method treatment concurrently employ indicate somewhat good result . Specifically , class chemotherapy agent call Vinca Alakaloids use combination radiation therapy appear promise determine small study . The drug Navelbine part class drug . This drug approve infusion vein . The pill form development use form treatment program . For protocol , radiation administer use schedule convenient patient , weekly chest irradiation total 12 week . Use schedule determine good commonly use daily radiotherapy . The weekly schedule less cumbersome involves less visit . The rationale reason ask participate program study whether drug Navelbine give together weekly radiation schedule . Radiation administer two fraction , 6 hour apart one day . For program , drug Navelbine would make available pill , would infuse vein . The propose protocol use increase dos drug Navelbine pill form find high dose Navelbine tolerate conjunction radiation therapy . Initially , subject receive one dose Navelbine , high dose previous subject . This escalation continue high tolerate dose determine . The administration via pill would easier avoid previously experienced side effect experience infusion vein subject , burn sore infusion site .</brief_summary>
