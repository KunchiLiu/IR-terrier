	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare antiviral activity two treatment group HIV chronic infection : QD regimen didanosine , lamivudine efavirenz versus BID regimen zidovudine , lamivudine efavirenz . Both administer food start treatment human immunodeficiency virus infection Week 48 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Once Day ( QD ) - Twice Day ( BID ) Clinical Trial : Didanosine , Lamivudine Efavirenz Versus Zidovudine , Lamivudine Efavirenz Starting Treatment HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The inhibition HIV replication mediate HAART cause actual immunological reconstitution clinically evidence dramatic reduction mortality , incidence opportunistic disease , hospital admission cost associate healthcare HIV-infected patient , show since year 1996 . Unfortunately , eradication HIV feasible therapy available ; therefore , treatment HIV infection currently approach `` life-long '' strategy . HAART free middle long-term adverse event . It must consider , relatively recently , HAART regimens require take high number tablet several time daily , frequently diet restriction , make compliance difficult improve quality life patient . In case , must note insufficient compliance HAART harmful consequence patient , public health health resource . The factor predict compliance ART depend patient , healthcare team therapeutic regimen . As mention , recent date , HAART gather factor make compliance difficult : long-term duration , one drug , one dose daily presence adverse event . Therefore , adequate compliance actual challenge patient health staff consider , good criterion , weak point antiretroviral treatment . For , state ideal HAART regimen would tablets could take daily . The expected advantage QD regimen could include mainly three : first , improve compliance , highly positive effect antiviral efficacy HAART . On hand , QD regimens enable HAART well adapt lifestyle patient low interference working hour , convenient improve quality life . Finally , must note QD regimens enable monitor HAART directly , allow relatively significant group patient set follow treatment great guarantee success , problem drug addiction , lack social support , mental disease admit penitentiary center . The main disadvantage QD regimens virtual lack large clinical trial compare therapeutic approach potent , well-established BID regimens . Therefore , interest examine approach randomize clinical trial adequate design propose . The second problem consequence result miss dose since could entail time - 24 hour follow failure - drug concentration could decrease enough stop inhibit viral replication ; could also promote emergence viral strain resistant drug . In principle , implication miss dose depend substantially pharmacokinetic property include QD regimen ( Cmin , half-life , intracellular concentration , IC50 HIV patient ) , , high drug half-life high Cmin/IC50 ratio , high probability alter miss dose Cmin persist IC50 HIV strain patient . Therefore , important select drug pharmacokinetic profile antiviral potency enough QD administration ( vide infra ) . BID regimen ( efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine ) : In study , choose BID regimen contain NNRTI efavirenz ( Sustiva® ) Combivir® commercial combination NRTI zidovudine + lamivudine , lead patient take one tablet morning 2 tablet night . We choose regimen ( zidovudine + lamivudine + efavirenz ) start treatment regimen HIV chronic infection best study consider many gold standard indication . QD regimen ( efavirenz + didanosine + lamivudine ) : The QD regimen make didanosine ( capsule-CT ) + lamivudine + efavirenz , regimen contain three tablet must take together night QD regimen experience date . We choose combination NRTI didanosine lamivudine , drug authorize QD use good safety profile interaction efavirenz . The combination didanosine lamivudine highly attractive fact recommend start HAART various agency though level combination zidovudine lamivudine ( administer BID ) less randomized clinical trial former latter combination NRTI . Therefore , one strength study propose possibility assess combination didanosine lamivudine start HAART regimen . In study , patient allocate QD regimen contain didanosine ( capsule-CT ) + lamivudine + efavirenz take tablet together night dinner . In principle , involve minor deviation data sheet didanosine specify drug must take fasting . Didanosine second antiretroviral drug market , last decade , presentation dosage form drug improve remarkably , bag buffer powder twice daily administration , dispersible tablet buffer , current dosage form gastroresistant capsule ( capsule-CT ) allow administration daily dos , since buffer , improve substantially gastric tolerance drug . The formulation didanosine powder buffer dispersible tablet must take fast absorption optimum , since administration food reduces significantly drug absorption plasma concentration . However , effect food absorption capsules-CT cause unequivocal reduction drug exposure . Primary Objective : - To compare antiviral activity two treatment group ( QD v BID ) Week 48 , base percentage patient HIV-RNA level &lt; 50 c/ml . Secondary Objectives : - To compare percentage patient respond treatment HIV-RNA level &lt; 400 c/ml Week 48 , approach analysis primary objective . - To compare time therapy failure Week 48 treatment regimen . - To compare increase CD4 cell level baseline Week 48 treatment regiment . - To compare impact quality life treatment regimen . - To compare compliance treatment regimen . - To compare safety tolerance treatment regimens along 48 week treatment . - To assess efficacy administration didanosine together food . Randomization Procedure : The randomization centralize stratified baseline viral burden level , high low 100,000 cop/ml . The patient give write informed consent include study . To include patient , clinical trial agency Gesida contact phone . Study Procedures : HIV-RNA , CD4 routine lab collect screening , baseline , w1 , w4 , w12 , w24 w48 . Quality life measure self-patient report questionnaire ( MOS-HIV ) .</detailed_description>
