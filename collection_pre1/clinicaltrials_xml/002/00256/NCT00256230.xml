	<brief_summary>Melanoma remain malignancy largely resistant chemotherapy . Metastatic disease respond poorly treatment use today 2 30 drug test , DTIC nitrosoureas , show response rate great 10 % , complete response rare . DTIC-based regimen recognize standard chemotherapy advance melanoma , temozolomide demonstrate efficacy equal DTIC oral alternative agent also cross blood brain barrier . Randomized phase III trial show survival benefit add agent ( cisplatin , BCNU , tamoxifen ) . Biochemotherapy develop extensively moderate improvement responsive rate ( approximately 50 % ) evaluation randomize trial identify whether survival benefit strategy , compare chemotherapy alone . Recently , randomize phase III study compare chemotherapy ( cisplatin , dacarbazine , tamoxifen ) biochemotherapy ( chemotherapy regimen plus high-dose IL-2 interferon alfa ) show 44 % response rate biochemotherapy vs. 27 % chemotherapy . However , tendency toward increase response rate patient receive biochemotherapy translate increase overall survival , , fact , trend survival advantage patient receive chemotherapy alone ( median survival : 10.7 v 15.8 month ) . New agent ( combination ) need develop refractory malignancy . The purpose study determine response rate evaluate toxicity disulfiram ( DSF ) treatment Stage IV melanoma . The advantage use DSF phase I/II trial following : - DSF use drug many year treatment alcoholism . Its mechanism , pharmacokinetics , toxicity/tolerable dose well know , drug relatively non-toxic therapeutic dose . Doses great 3000mg/m2 cause reversible confusion . - DSF take orally ; therefore , convenient administer . - DSF penetrate blood-brain barrier ( unlike dacarbazine many chemotherapy agent ) ; therefore , might active effect CNS metastasis . This study design include woman minority , design measure differences intervention effect .</brief_summary>
