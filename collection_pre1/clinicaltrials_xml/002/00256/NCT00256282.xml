	<brief_summary>Annually U.S. estimate 40,000 new case malignant melanoma 7000 death . This disease become common incidence increase rapid rate past decade cancer except lung cancer woman . Metastatic disease respond poorly usual treatment 2 30 drug test , DTIC nitrosoureas , show response rate great 10 % . Complete response rare . Metastatic melanoma disease therapeutic option . Multi-agent chemotherapy cisplatin ( CDDP ) , Dacarbazine ( DTIC ) , Carmustine ( BCNU ) , without Tamoxifen , offer 20 % response rate fail consistently demonstrate significant improvement overall survival ( OS ) disease-free survival ( DFS ) compare single agent DTIC . Recently , investigator , effort combine activity biologic response modifier chemotherapy , developed combination biochemotherapy metastatic melanoma . Legha et al report overall objective response rate 64 % 5-day biochemotherapy regimen . O'Day et al report similar result ( overall response rate 57 % ) use modify 5-day biochemotherapy regimen . The regimen significant toxicity modest response rate . Clearly , effective less toxic regimen need . Vinorelbine tartrate ( Navelbine ) Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) show activity melanoma . Additionally , combination drug show enhanced activity melanoma .</brief_summary>
