	<brief_summary>About 10 % population believe suffer Primary Insomnia . It also believe people chronic insomnia sleep system essentially alignment ( call `` homeostatic dysregulation '' ) . We also know certain form non-medication therapy call cognitive-behavioral therapy effective treatment insomnia . It know , however , whether cognitive-behavioral therapy actually work bring brain 's sleep system back alignment ( `` sleep homeostasis '' ) . One method use measure sleep homeostasis observe person 's brain wave sleep particularly sleep follow period sleep loss . The purpose study first learn whether person insomnia misalign sleep system compare person insomnia assess sleep people period extend sleep loss . Second , study determine whether cognitive-behavioral therapy re-regulate sleep system response sleep loss . Third , final purpose examine whether immune system people insomnia alter following sleep loss comparison group whether cognitive-behavioral therapy alter immune function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep Homeostasis Primary Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite magnitude problem Primary Insomnia , good efficacy Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Insomnia ( CBT-I ) , little known pathophysiology insomnia whether treatment alters factor think maintain chronic insomnia . Three main factor explore contribute chronic insomnia : hyperarousal , circadian dysrhythmia , homeostatic dysregulation . Most empirical work related role hyperarousal along three dimension : somatic , cognitive , cortical . The present study focus homeostatic abnormality secondarily hyperarousal exhibited subject Primary Insomnia ( PIs ) compare Good Sleeper control ( GSs ) . Homeostatic abnormality assess evaluate patient insomnia respond sleep deprivation . This study use Modified Sleep Deprivation Multiple Sleep Latency Test ( MSD/MSLT ) procedure . Response procedure assess term sleep continuity , sleep architecture electroencephalographic ( EEG ) power spectral change recovery sleep . Hyperarousal evaluate use serial measure somatic ( cortisol ) cortical ( EEG Beta/Gamma activity ) arousal across sleep deprivation protocol . These parameter evaluate prior follow CBT-I PIs follow equivalent time interval GSs .</detailed_description>
