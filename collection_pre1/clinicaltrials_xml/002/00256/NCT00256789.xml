	<brief_summary>This program design treatment patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . The study design patient whose cancer advance therefore operated goal completely remove cancer . Patients stage disease traditionally receive radiation therapy chemotherapy treatment succession . Recently , administration method treatment employ preliminary study indicate somewhat good result . Specifically , new class chemotherapy agent call taxanes use combination radiation therapy appear promise determine small study . However , best treatment type cancer establish yet . One goal study investigate combination new drug Taxotere ( drug belong taxane class ) give day radiation well tolerate result enhanced shrinkage cancer compare traditional radiation therapy . In study radiation give one day , rather divide five day per week ( Monday Friday ) previous study . Previous research show equal effective treating lung cancer . The study use drug Taxotere conjunction radiation therapy . Taxotere approve medicine United States Food Drug Administration treatment lung cancer . The purpose study evaluate chemotherapy drug Taxotere administer weekly together concurrent radiation day effective shrink non-small cell lung cancer . This trial also investigate well treatment tolerated effect treatment everyday life activity participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>40 patient locally advance metastatic NSCLC enrol ( stage III IV ) treat per week total 12 cycle ( 12 week ) accord schedule outline . Chemotherapy : The suggested phase II dose weekly Taxotere concomitant standard chest radiotherapy determine 20mg/m2 . In unpublished phase I clinical trial , find 35 mg/m2 well tolerate therefore dose chosen phase II study . The drug administer intravenously day radiation . All patient premedicated 12 hour prior chemotherapy Decadrone . Patients follow evaluated weekly physician . Radiation therapy : Although radiation deliver differently previous Taxotere base combine modality study , total radiation dose remain . Treatment give large field 2-3 cm tumor margin . All involve suspicious nodal area radiate well . To reduce volume toxicity , `` field within field '' technique employ . Tumor involve node receive 200 cGy + 300 cGy . A total 12 treatment administered weekly , single session . Total treatment 6000 cGy . Radiation treatment administer 24 hour Taxotere infusion .</detailed_description>
