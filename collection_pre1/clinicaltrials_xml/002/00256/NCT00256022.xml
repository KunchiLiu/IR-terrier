	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis study pre-operative prophylactic probiotic Lactobacilli tablet reduce severity incidence endotoxin rise post cardiopulmonary bypass cardiac surgery patient . Endotoxins large heat stable lipopolysaccharides , find cell wall gram negative bacteria . It assume intestinal bacteria primary source plasma endotoxin cardiac surgery patients.Lactobacilli report effective counteracting gram negative bacteria gut.Thus Lactobacilli may effective reduce endotoxin rise associate cardiopulmonary bypass , may potentially reduce incidence syndrome generalise inflammation low systemic vascular resistance post cardiopulmonary bypass .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Prophylactic Pre Operative Probiotic Therapy Endotoxin Levels Cardiac Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study compare endotoxin level post operative cardiac surgery patient receive pre operative prophylactic probiotic Lactobacillus tablet . Compared patient receive placebo . Two different lactobacillus strain assess study : Lactobacillus Acidophilus Lactobacillus Fermentum . There 4 treatment group study . Lactobacillus Acidophilus , Lactobacillus Fermentum , Lactobacillus Fermentum Lactobacillus Acidophilus Placebo . The probiotic/placebo give patient 2 dy 2-7 day preoperatively . Participation study require 6 separate blood test commence start surgery continue 24 hour immediately post operatively.A total 30 ml blood require .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients schedule cardiac surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass approach consent participate study . Age great equal 18 year Current usage probiotic product Past history asthma recurrent urticaria , pregnancy , HIV infection , immunosuppression pre exist intestinal disorder . The Lactobacillus acidophilus preparation use study contain small amount MSG ( total dose 20mg/day , equivalent 10 % total dose use test MSG sensitivity ) precaution patient asthma recurrent urticaria exclude . As Lactobacillus preparation contains live micro organism , immunosuppressed pregnant patient exclude .</criteria>
