	<brief_summary>The study design patient non small cell lung cancer whose cancer advance therefore operated goal completely remove cancer . At stage disease , patient cure disease , however , treatment help live long well keep cancer control . For purpose , patient traditionally receive radiation therapy chemotherapy treatment succession . Recently , administration treatment method give concurrently show somewhat good result compare successive administration . In study drug Taxotere together radiation perform well keep cancer good control . Combination drug Taxotere together compound call 5-FU either continuous infusion oral form pill call `` Xeloda '' enhance anti cancer activity substantially . One goal study investigate much combination give conjunction chest radiation . Using X-rays , study also evaluate much shrinkage cancer cause treatment directly tumor site area cancer may also spread . In study radiation give one day per week two session , rather divide five day per week ( Monday Friday ) commonly use . However , schedule find equally effective . The treatment program use increase dos 5-FU medication , either infusion pill find high dose tolerate . Once high tolerate dose determine , subsequent patient enrol continue treat dose level . The dose drug Taxotere remain throughout . Hypothesis : Our previous research suggest combination Taxotere 5-FU give together weekly chest radiation provide convenient form treatment conventional approach also least similar efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypo-Hyperfractionated Chest Radiation Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With Taxotere/Xeloda Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The original weekly hypofractionated chest irradiation protocol descrived Salazar et al . follow slight modification . The dose split two fraction , give 6 hour apart . We find fractionation two dos reduce radiation-related side effect . Treatment give large field 2-3 cm tumor margin . All involve suspicious nodal area radiate well . A total 12 treatment administered weekly . Total treatment 6000 cGy . Radiation treatment administer within 2 hour Taxotere infusion . All patient receive fix dose Taxotere 25 mg/m2 per week day radiotherapy preceeding radiation . All patient premedicated use standard antiemetic Decadron ( 8 mg po 12 hour prior Taxotere , 1 mg Kytril po , 20 mg Decadron iv , 50 mg Benadryl iv 20 mg Pepcid iv , 30 min prior Taxotere ) . A dose escalation 5-FU Xeloda employed . 5-FU give continuous infusion , Xeloda orally Monday Friday throughout 12 week radiation . Upon reach maximum tolerate dose , remainder patient treat 5-FU/Xeloda dose level MTD . Patients unable tolerate oral Xeloda size tablet difficulties upper gastroiontestinal tract Xeloda obtain , intravenous equivalent 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) administer continuous intravenous infusion . Patients start Xeloda treatment experience difficulty continue take Xeloda maybe switch biological equivalent dose 5-FU treatment . The 5-FU dose range administer lieu Xeloda administer adjustment make 50 mg/m2/day step previously pubished Lokich et al .</detailed_description>
