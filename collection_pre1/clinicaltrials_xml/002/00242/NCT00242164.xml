	<brief_summary>The study perform good understand dialysis technique keep heart function stable dialysis . People dialysis high risk heart disease stroke . More information dialysis technique keep heart stable may help prevent high risk cardiovascular disease death help reduce discomfort dialysis . This study look way magnesium dialysate affect heart function dialysis . High low level magnesium may change way heart beat . The question ask lowering amount magnesium dialysate affect amount magnesium blood change heart beat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Defining The Role Of Dialysate Magnesium In Arrhythmogenicity On Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart disease major cause illness death among patient dialysis . Changes heart 's rhythm sudden cardiac death also important problem group . Abnormal rhythm occur hemodialysis . During dialysis , blood come contact solution call dialysate . This solution contain mineral like calcium , potassium magnesium . Some study indirectly suggest low magnesium dialysis patient protect rhythm problem . Factors increase chance development abnormal rhythm indirectly assess evaluate electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . This do measuring distance wave form EKG . One call QT interval . QT dispersion value derive QT interval . A long QT interval think make individual prone abnormal heart rhythm . Therefore plan study effect low level magnesium dialysate QT interval dispersion tendency rhythm change . QT interval change compare dialysis low magnesium QT interval change dialysis normal magnesium . This cross trial include 24 adult male female patient chronic hemodialysis . Subjects study two regular dialysis session , difference amount magnesium dialysate . QT interval QT dispersion calculate EKG recording dialysis session . The result study lead well understanding cardiovascular risk patient undergo chronic dialysis may offer potentially novel strategy reduce risk abnormal heart rhythm risk dialysis .</detailed_description>
