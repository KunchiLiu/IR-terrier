	<brief_title>Japan Assessment Pitavastatin Atorvastatin Acute Coronary Syndrome ( JAPAN-ACS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous mega trial demonstrate lipid lower therapy HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) reduce incidence major cardiovascular event one-third , thus , benefit lipid lower therapy substantiate . Such benefit significant especially patient coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . The third report National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel ( NCEP ATP-III ) suggest advantage intensive lipid lower therapy goal reduce LDL-C 70 mg/dL patient categorize high risk . In Japan , Japan Atherosclerosis Society ( JAS ) Guidelines Diagnosis Treatment Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases 2002 recommend LDL-C goal patient coronary heart disease 100 mg/dL . However , satisfactory evidence yet need low LDL-C level less goal prescribe Japan . Recently , research diagnosis coronary plaque show significant advance . The REVERSAL study patient history CHD , diagnosis intravascular ultrasound , suggest intensive lipid lower therapy atorvastatin ( 80 mg/day ) associate growth plaque ( -0.4 % compare baseline ) , versus therapy pravastatin ( 40 mg/day ) show slight increase ( 2.7 % ) plaque volume 18 month . In Japan , ESTABLISH study , single center study , indicate early intensive lipid lower therapy atorvastatin ( 20 mg/day ) could induce significant reduction plaque volume patient acute coronary syndrome . However , benefit verify multicenter trial Japan . Further , comparative investigation effect various concomitant drug coronary plaque do . Pitavastatin chemically synthesize statin Japan market since late 2003 . Pitavastatin LDL-C lower effect strong atorvastatin also superior HDL-C elevate effect ; meanwhile , effect pitavastatin coronary plaque report .</detailed_description>
