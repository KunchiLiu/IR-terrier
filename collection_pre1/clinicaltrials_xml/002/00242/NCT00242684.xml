	<brief_summary>Background : There tremendous controversy regard adequacy/effectiveness nutritional care provide VA Transitional Care Units ( TCUs ) . The interrelationship concurrent inflammatory disease , adequacy resident 's nutrient consumption , development resolution putative nutritional deficit , clinical outcome establish . Given known obstacle increase nutrient intake ( e.g . cost , resident acceptance , associate morbidity ) lack proven effectiveness form nutrition support nutritional supplementation improve clinical outcome , good understand interrelationship need focus study . Objectives : The primary objective study determine best define nutritional risk ( i.e. , risk adverse clinical outcome due inadequate nutrient intake ) among old VA TCU resident . As part objective , seek develop well understand interrelationship nutrient intake , weight change , serum concentration albumin , health status/illness severity , mortality . The secondary objective develop prediction model identify TCU resident likely ongoing problem low nutrient intake . The ultimate objective develop clinically useful system identify resident likely benefit specific intervention aim improve nutritional risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : There tremendous controversy regard adequacy/effectiveness nutritional care provide VA Transitional Care Units ( TCUs ) . The interrelationship concurrent inflammatory disease , adequacy resident 's nutrient consumption , development resolution putative nutritional deficit , clinical outcome establish . Given known obstacle increase nutrient intake ( e.g . cost , resident acceptance , associate morbidity ) lack proven effectiveness form nutrition support nutritional supplementation improve clinical outcome , good understand interrelationship need focus study . Objectives : The primary objective study determine best define nutritional risk ( i.e. , risk adverse clinical outcome due inadequate nutrient intake ) among old VA TCU resident . As part objective , seek develop well understand interrelationship nutrient intake , weight change , serum concentration albumin , health status/illness severity , mortality . The secondary objective develop prediction model identify TCU resident likely ongoing problem low nutrient intake . The ultimate objective develop clinically useful system identify resident likely benefit specific intervention aim improve nutritional risk . Methods : To meet objective , 400 old , non-terminally ill veteran admit VA TCU ( average length stay approximately 90 day ) prospectively study use methodologic approach validate prior VA hospital-based investigation . After complete comprehensive admission assessment , subject monitor closely throughout his/her TCU stay serial nutrient intake recur metabolic , functional , neuropsychological , cognitive , nutritional , medical assessment . Weights , anthropometrics , blood serum protein , inflammatory marker ( e.g. , cytokine ) , select lab index obtain least monthly discharge . Resting metabolic rate ( indirect calorimetry ) obtain select resident . Each subject remain study 12 month . From discharge end subject 's study year , subject monitor phone determine survival day institutional ( e.g. , hospital , NH ) care . At study 's end , strengths association assess use univariable multivariable analytic technique include logistic Cox Proportional-Hazards analysis . Findings : See citation link . Status : Status : Funding begin 9-1-2005 . Subject recruitment begin 3-1-2006 . To date , recruit 446 subject study . 446 subject discharge inpatient phase study . The average length stay subject 32 day . Impact : Our study provide clear understanding factor contribute apparent nutritional deficit see many old veteran reside VA nursing home TCUs . The study also lead development clinically useful system identify TCU resident likely benefit specific intervention aim improve nutritional risk thus clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
