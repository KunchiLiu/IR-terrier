	<brief_summary>The primary objective ass progression-free survival ( PFS ) measure 16 week follow initiation therapy combination Avastin erlotinib patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Progression-free survival define time initiation therapy document disease progression death . Secondary objective include : response rate , median overall survival , toxicity tolerability , ascertain whether correlation response prior treatment status underlie HCC risk factor ( ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Bevacizumab Erlotinib Treat Primary Liver Cancer That Can Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver cancer growth may affect protein body call `` vascular epidermal growth factor '' ( VEGF ) . A drug block VEGF may effective treatment liver cancer . Avastin design block VEGF . Erlotinib hydrochloride investigational drug believe work cancer cell affect epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , protein important cancer growth . If screening evaluation show eligible take part study , may begin treatment . You receive treatment 28-day period call `` cycle '' . Treatment give outpatient basis . Because research study , Avastin infusion must give every time M. D. Anderson . Because erlotinib hydrochloride give mouth , may take away M. D. Anderson . You receive Avastin needle vein Days 1 15 cycle . The first dose Avastin give 90 minute . If reaction ( fever/chills ) , next dose give 60 minute . If reaction occur , dose give 30 minute . If experience reaction Avastin infusion , may give acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) mouth and/or antihistamine vein 30 minute dose help decrease risk reaction . You take erlotinib hydrochloride tablet mouth every day . It recommend erlotinib hydrochloride take morning glass water . Erlotinib hydrochloride take least 1 hour 2 hour food , grapefruit juice , vitamin , iron supplement , non-prescription medicine . Before new cycle study treatment , urine collect , blood drawn ( 3 tablespoon ) routine blood test check blood clotting . You ask question side effect may medications currently take take since last saw study doctor . You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . You ask ability perform everyday task . You also CT and/or MRI scan tumor ( ) every 8 week . Additional test may do study doctor feel necessary care . All test evaluation must do M. D. Anderson . If experience severe side effect , treatment may delay , stop , may receive small dos treatment . You may continue receive study treatment unless disease get bad , side effect severe , decide take part longer , doctor decides best interest stop treatment . There maximum number cycle receive . When stop study treatment , ask test evaluation do end-of-study visit . You urine collect , blood drawn ( 3 tablespoon ) routine blood test check blood clotting . You ask question side effect may medications currently take take since last saw study doctor . You complete physical exam , include measurement blood pressure , pulse , temperature , weight . You ask ability perform everyday task . You also CT and/or MRI scan abdomen pelvis check cancer . Once stop receiving study treatment , study doctor nurse continue check , either clinic telephone stop come M. D. Anderson , every 3 month rest life . This investigational study . Erlotinib hydrochloride approve FDA treatment lung cancer , approve liver cancer , use consider experimental study . Avastin approve FDA treatment colon rectal cancer , approve treatment liver cancer , use consider experimental study . Up 60 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
