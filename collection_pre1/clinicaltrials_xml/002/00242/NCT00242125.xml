	<brief_summary>Primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) chronic liver disease primarily affect middle age woman . It characterize immune-mediated damage cell line tiny bile duct within liver . Although underlying cause PBC likely multifactorial , epidemiologic/population data indicate important role genetic predisposition , mean disease seem run family . Susceptibility gene PBC identify possibly due limitation small sample size prior study . The primary objective study identify gene . This study involve obtain clinical demographic data well collect DNA sample patient parent , sibling screen select set candidate gene well full genome variant associate PBC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal predicate cumulative data reveal major role genetic factor PBC recent positional cloning gene Crohn ’ disease , type 2 diabetes rheumatoid well psoriatic arthritis data provide “ proof-of-principle ” susceptibility gene multigenic disease identify linkage association strategy . Our group access &gt; 600 patient PBC individual plus family member provide excellent resource PBC gene discovery . Moreover , International PBC Consortium initiate serve validate finding also serve source additional patient accrual search gene small effect . Thanks remarkable advance genotyping technology sequence data emanate Human Genome Project , patient population fully mine identify susceptibility gene common multigenic disease . By combine patient resource group Canadian center available knowledge full genome sequence extensive information SNPs within sequence , well expertise high throughput genotyping rapid computational approach genetic data , well position begin delineate susceptibility allele PBC . As allele identify , information use define molecular pathophysiology disease , determine whether genetic marker use predict risk and/or stratify patient relation prognosis drug responsiveness , ultimately , identify novel target improve therapeutic intervention . For purpose study patient definite diagnosis PBC recruit ie : - elevate serum alkaline phosphatase level positive AMA ELISA immunofluorescence ( &gt; 1/40 titer ) time initial diagnosis liver biopsy confirm diagnosis PBC . After sign consent form patient complete questionnaire . With patient ’ permission coordinator contact patient ’ parent sibling either affect unaffected PBC ask participate study . A total five tube blood take participant study . The blood sample use study liver biochemistry study inherit genetic material ( DNA ) order find cause PBC . In addition go review medical record patient PBC TWH recruit study use record hold Misys examine verify medical surgical history , past physical exam , laboratory test treatment . Each patient also ask recruit unrelated ( usually spouses ) household member friends live locally act control . They treat similarly regard consent form , questionnaire blood work . The plan approximately 600 patient PBC along approximately 1800 relative unrelated healthy volunteer take part study – multicentre study – sit Toronto , London Halifax . Statistical Analyses/Power Calculations : The use association analysis identify susceptibility allele highly dependent linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) SNP marker disease loci . To demonstrate extent LD use delineate PBC locus , collaborator Dr. C. Amos carry calculation power detect significant effect ( p ≤ 0.05 level ) case-control analysis assume different amount LD . Dr. Amos direct statistical genetics group MD Anderson Cancer Centre longstanding collaborator K. Siminovitch . He group member also statistical advisor several disease-mapping consortium , NARAC , US-based consortium discovery rheumatoid arthritis gene . To estimate power association study identify PBC susceptibility allele , Dr. Amos use data Talwalkar Lindor , estimate PBC prevalence 0.05 % among adult female 15 fold increase risk PBC among first-degree relative affected individual . Assuming mutation frequency disease causation 0.1 % also PBC cause single gene , level risk among affected first-degree relative implies penetrance among carrier PBC susceptibility alleles 6 % among non-carriers 0.4 % . A single gene model PBC , however , simplistic consistent available epidemiologic data . If instead , assumption 4 disease causative locus make risk thus assign one locus , genotype-specific risk would 2.6 % , locus-specific relative risk would modest 3.75 , disease allelic frequency carrier would 10 % . In study propose , begin study 300 case 300 control PBC association specific candidate gene discuss . The power detect association case-control study highly dependent upon LD disease mutation SNPs closely link loci well number gene study ( 40 ) . If assume high level disequilibrium , disequilibrium coefficient ( D ’ ) 0.9 , conservative , apply Bonferroni ’ correction simultaneous evaluation 40 locus , achieve 5 % power study require obtain single SNP test p-value 0.00125 . Based disease allele frequency 10 % ( calculate ) , analysis 300 case 300 control , power detect SNP marker-disease association would 84 % . The study power increase number case and/or control . Thus , conserve resource , genotyping initially carry use 300 case 300 control , additional 300 control genotyped marker show significant result p=0.01 level . Genome-wide association analysis also carry initially 300 case control . However , genome-wide screen likely yield many false positive loci-disease association , loci show association 5 % level confirm use replicate set 300 case control and/or trio family , 200 family available .</detailed_description>
