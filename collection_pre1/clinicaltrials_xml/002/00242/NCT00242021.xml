	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate effect fatty acid composition fat supplement : 1. acutely ( single intake ) subjective objective measurement hunger , satiety wellness , energy intake , postprandial hormonal change ; 2. long-term ( one week ) ( regulator ) fat tissue metabolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Fatty Acid Composition Energy Intake Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One physiological factor regulate food intake pattern satiety . Satiety define absence ingestive motivation , end next meal initiate ( Blundell et al. , 1996 ) . Food intake affect number physiological objective parameter blood know involved signal satiety , glucose ( Melanson et al , 1999 ; Chapman et al , 1999 ; Campfield et al , 1996 ) , insulin ( Speechly et al , 2000 ) cholecystokinin ( CCK ) ( Gutzwiller et al. , 2000 ; Beglinger et al. , 2001 ; French et al. , 2000 ; Degen et al. , 2001 ; Burton-Freemanet al. , 2002 , 2004 ) . More recently , gastric hormone ghrelin identify marker hunger meal initiation ( De Graaf et al , 2004 ) . Ghrelin concentration blood highly correlate subjective measure appetite . PYY , gut hormone produce postprandially , measure study mention hormone inhibits food intake ( Batterham et al. , 2003 ) . The baseline level PYY low obese subject lean subject . The two group different body weight therefore show different baseline level , perhaps different curve well . Humans eat response metabolic physiological need . Humans also respond significant extend internal subjective emotional signal ( cue ) . The exact relation physiological internal signal subjective emotional internal signal know . Besides also external social factor modulate physiological-derived hunger satiety signal . In present clinical trial , effect fatty acid composition fat supplement study hunger satiety . In supplement mixture fatty acid know satiate effect test compare control supplement contain fatty acid normally consume breakfast .</detailed_description>
