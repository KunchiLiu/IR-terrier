	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance know associate mood disorder cognitive difficulty . The purpose study treat depress patient rosiglitazone ( also know [ AKA ] Avandia ) , therefore improve glucose sensitivity , turn potential affect mood think . We , researcher Stanford University , recruit men woman diagnose depression , willing participate 3 month study . Participation involve neuropsychological testing , 2 blood draw call oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , test glucose insulin level , medication , rosiglitazone . Participants allow continue current psychiatric medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An association insulin resistance ( IR ) affective disorder postulate number cross-sectional study . Limited data exist potential change IR associate improvement depressive symptom and/or depression remission resolution - two study report decreased IR successful antidepressant treatment , another study report persist IR even successful treatment . We postulate IR part pathophysiology affective disorder , improvement ( via pharmacological nonpharmacological treatment ) may significantly reduce severity depressive symptom . In support hypothesis , previously report increased IR woman bipolar disorder , well significant association IR depressive symptom woman primary IR syndrome ( polycystic ovary syndrome [ PCOS ] ) . In current pilot study , attempt direct test hypothesis improvement IR result improvement mood patient depressive disorder . The aim study evaluate whether addition peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( PPAR ) agonist rosiglitazone treatment usual ( TAU ) nondiabetic patient unipolar bipolar depression would result improvement depression severity clinical global impression ( CGI ) . Insulin sensitize agent proven efficacious nondiabetic IR , `` prediabetic '' , individual . All subject pilot study elevate fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) ratios high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) triglyceride ( TG ) , establish surrogate marker IR . In current pilot study , attempt direct test hypothesis improvement IR result improvement mood patient depressive disorder . The aim study evaluate whether addition peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( PPAR ) agonist rosiglitazone treatment usual ( TAU ) nondiabetic patient unipolar bipolar depression would result improvement depression severity clinical global impression ( CGI ) .
