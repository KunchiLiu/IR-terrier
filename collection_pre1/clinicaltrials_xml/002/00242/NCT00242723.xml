	<brief_summary>Background : - Chromatin structural building block chromosome . It find inside nucleus cell consist complex DNA protein . - Cancers lung , pleura ( lung lining ) esophagus show profound change chromatin structure may affect course disease patient . - A good understanding diseases genetic change associate may helpful develop new treatment . Objectives : - To evaluate people cancer lung , pleura esophagus participation NCI clinical trial . - To obtain biopsy ( small piece tissue ) tumor , normal tissue blood sample learn cellular change blood tissue tumor lung , esophagus pleura surround structure chest . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old cancer lung , esophagus , pleura , mediastinum chest wall , cancer origin invade lung . Design : - Up 800 patient may include study . - Patients undergo standard test evaluate stage disease determine eligibility NCI investigational treatment study . - All patient undergo bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage ( `` wash '' salt water ) ass tumor collect sample normal tissue . Patients whose tumor locate outside portion lung may also undergo thoracoscopy obtain tumor sample . For bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage tube light pass nose mouth lung examine airway . Salt water inject tube withdrawn obtain cell laboratory study . For thoracoscopy small tube light put small hole chest obtain tumor sample . Both procedure usually do general anesthesia . The tissue examine identify cell characteristic people respond certain therapy identify marker surface tissue may useful future research treatment . - Blood urine sample collect patient . - Patients eligible treatment study NCI offer participation study . - Patients standard surgery , radiation chemotherapy appropriate may receive treatment NCI physician . - Patients receive treatment NCI return follow-up examination 4 week discharge every 2 4 month depend nature cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : -Lung esophageal cancer well malignant pleural mesothelioma exhibit profound alteration chromatin structure , may impact clinical course neoplasm . -To date , epigenetic alteration primary thoracic malignancy neoplasms metastatic chest evaluate systematic manner . Objectives : - To permit evaluation patient refer Thoracic Surgery Section , Thoracic GI Oncology Branch , NCI order identify individual suitable candidate clinical research protocol . - To obtain biopsy stag study tumor adjacent normal tissue well serum urine sample patient primary metastatic malignancy involve lung , esophagus , pleura , mediastinum support preclinical research endeavor Thoracic Surgery Section . - To obtain blood , buccal mucosa , tumor tissue malignant peritoneal/pleural effusion patient lung , esophageal , mediastinal , chest wall malignancy focus germline test gene modulate drug metabolism , possible future whole genome sequence study , possible ex vivo generation autologous tumor cell line EBVtransformed B cell line research . Tumor tissue obtain previous protocol participation cryopreserved may undergo process patient consent trial . - To permit standard treatment patient eligible investigational therapy current Thoracic Surgery protocol , present novel unique clinical training opportunity , manifest clinical condition require immediate intervention prevent compromise patient 's well-being . - To permit long term follow patient thoracic malignancy include collection tissue fluid support preclinical research particularly ascertain gene expression DNA methylation profile coincide response therapy . Eligibility : - Patients potentially malignant suspicious lesion biopsy proven , lung cancer esophageal cancer , malignant pleural mesothelioma , mediastinal chest wall neoplasm , thymoma/thymic neoplasm , pulmonary metastasis cancer non-thoracic origin . - Patients ECOG performance score 0-2 . - Patients 18 year age may participate tissue acquisition perform clinically indicated surgical procedure , sample tissue , blood urine add risk clinically indicate procedure . - Patients must coagulation parameter within acceptable limit standard practice guideline prior biopsy Design : - This protocol design : - facilitate screening patient investigational protocol Thoracic Surgery Section , propose Thoracic GI Oncology Branch , NCI , , obtain tissue sample enable evaluation epigenetic event primary metastatic thoracic malignancy , extension ongoing laboratory research Thoracic Oncology laboratory . - allow establishment tumor cell line EBV-transformed B cell line support immunologic evaluation patient response clinical trial . - Patients screen determine appropriate diagnostic treatment intervention . Where appropriate , patient receive stag surgical intervention necessary follow care . Tissue , blood , and/or peritoneal/pleural effusion sample obtain surgery/biopsy clinic visit process either store analysis culture generation tumor cell line EBV-transformed B cell line research . After recovery biopsy surgery patient continue follow , blood urine sample collect well tissue appropriate . - No investigational treatment administer protocol . In circumstance approve Section Chief , patient may deem ineligible investigational therapy , yet may present unique clinical training experience Thoracic Surgery Section physicians clinical associate , undergo standard treatment . - It anticipate protocol enroll ~ 75 - 80 patient per year 10 year maximum 800 patient .</detailed_description>
