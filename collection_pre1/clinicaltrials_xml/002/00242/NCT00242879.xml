	<brief_summary>This two phase study ( randomise non-randomised phase ) . The randomised phase initially examine 4 blinded dos GW640385 boost rtv ( continuation current background therapy ) comparison ongoing , open-labeled rtv-boosted protease inhibitor ( PI ) regimen 15 day . At Day 15 visit , subject optimize background therapy . Additionally , subject receive low dose GW640385 re-randomised one high dose subject control arm receive new rtv-boosted PI base resistance test screen . Subjects remain randomized phase one 4 continue treatment arm least 48 week . An interim analysis occur randomise phase select dose GW640385 evaluate Phase III study . After dose selection subject move non-randomised phase study . In non-randomised phase subject receive GW640385 assign final select dose assessment long term safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , antiviral activity .</brief_summary>
