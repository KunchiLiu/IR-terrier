	<detailed_description>The study examine effect insulin-sensitizing agent rosiglitazone learn memory 120 patient diagnosed MCI . Participants randomize 18-month trial rosiglitazone placebo , follow 2-month washout period . At screen treatment month 18 , participant undergo oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) estimate pre- post- treatment insulin sensitivity Î²-cell function . Cognitive measure blood sample biochemical assay obtain baseline , treatment month 6 , 12 , 18 , washout ( two month complete treatment ) . During treatment , participant safety labs draw receive physical assessment adverse event , change health status , change medication ; initially visit do week 2 4 , every three month . For month safety visit schedule , telephone monitoring assess health concern conduct . All participant enrol primary study approach participate MRI substudy ; patient undergo serial brain MRI treatment follow 18 month rosiglitazone placebo , use three-dimensional T1-weighted image . Comparison MCI patient receive rosiglitazone placebo conduct determine whether rate medial temporal lobe ( MTL ) whole brain atrophy alter follow treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>MCI diagnosis : Participants diagnose MCI consensus team physicians neuropsychologists experience diagnosis MCI , use Petersen ( Petersen , 1999 , 2001 ) criterion amnestic MCI multiple domain MCI amnestic feature : ) presence subjective memory complaint , evaluate via detailed patient history informant interview , b ) objective verification memory impairment measure neuropsychological test , c ) normal general cognitive function , ) intact mildly impaired activity daily live , e ) absence dementia per NINCDS/ADRDA and/or DSMIV criteria The following exclusion criterion use , base initial physical examination , medical history , lab work , oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) result : Diagnosis diabetes relevant glucoregulatory disorder Use oral antidiabetic compound Clinically significant elevation liver function Significant neurological disease might affect cognition , MCI , include Alzheimer 's disease , largevessel stroke , Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis , recent severe head injury ( loss consciousness 30 minute past year ) , remote head injury result permanent cognitive neurological sequela History current evidence congestive heart failure ( CHF ) History document ischemic cardiac disease , i.e. , angina , MI , angioplasty , stent , CABG History cardiac vascular surgery , significant arrhythmia within last year ; plan major intervention cardiac surgery stenting . A history cardiac surgery nonischemic indication ( i.e. , valve repair replacement ) great one year prior enrollment exclusionary criterion meet Significant ECG abnormalities include heart rate le 50 great 100 beat per minute ( dependent upon individual 's general health ) ; previously unrecognized arrhythmia require intervention Significant peripheral edema time screen Significant medical illness organ failure , include limited renal disease , hepatic disease , unstable cardiac disease Regular current use antipsychotic , anticonvulsive , anxiolytic , sedative medication ; antidepressant medication exclusionary , provide individual current major depression A current diagnosis major depression significant psychiatric comorbidity Clinically significant anemia time screen Fasting triglyceride level great 400 Fasting glucose 125 great , twohour glucose value great 199 OGTT ; participant notify fast blood sugar ( monitor every 3 month ) exceed 125 , withdraw participation fast blood sugar exceed 125 two consecutive month For MRI substudy , additional exclusion criterion include 1 ) previous exposure work involve cut grind metal , 2 ) presence pacemaker , aneurysm clip , implant metal device would prohibit MRI procedure , 3 ) significant history claustrophobia</criteria>
