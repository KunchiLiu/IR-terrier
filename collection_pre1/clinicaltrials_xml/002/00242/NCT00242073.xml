	<brief_summary>Hypoxia ( low oxygen level ) know present many tumor may strongly influence success treatment progression disease prostate cancer . The method use measure tumor oxygen level prostate cancer place needle prostate rectum . Blood oxygen level dependent imaging ( BOLD MRI ) special MRI technique allow indirect assessment oxygen level blood . This technique non-invasive , involve needle . BOLD apply human prostate cancer . The purpose study develop MRI-BOLD technique allow u non-invasively measure change relate tumor hypoxia prostate cancer . This technique may provide information independent predictor patient survival , tumor recurrence likelihood treatment response prostate cancer</brief_summary>
