	<brief_summary>This study gain information method control prosthetic arm stroke patient traumatic brain inury patient technique call `` brain-computer interface '' ( BCI ) . BCI allow direct communication man machine . Brain cell communicate produce electrical impulse help create thing thought , memory , consciousness emotion . In BCI , brain wave record electroencephalogram ( EEG ) electrode ( small wire ) attach scalp . The electrodes measure electrical signal brain . These signal send computer , translate device control command message reflect person 's intention . This type brain activity come sensorimotor area brain control voluntarily train control hand prosthesis BCI . Healthy normal volunteer people stroke traumatic brain injury 12 month ago paralysis right left arm , hand leg 18 80 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen clinical neurological examination magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain . MRI use magnetic field radio wave obtain image brain . The scanner metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . During procedure , subject lie scanner 45 minute , wear ear plug muffle loud knock sound occur scan . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Sessions 1-2 : Participants connect EEG machine familiarize hand orthosis ( train device use study ) task require study . - Sessions 3-4 : Participants receive baseline transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) fMRI . For TMS , wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The subject may feel pull sensation skin coil may twitch muscle face , arm leg . The subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The effect TMS muscle detect small metal disk electrode tap skin arm . fMRI like standard MRI ( see ) , except do patient performs task learn brain activity involve task . - Sessions 5-8 : Participants ask repetitively move hand ( patient ' paralyzed hand ; healthy volunteer ' normal hand ) , tongue leg response three sound tone . After ten trial , ask imagine movement 50 100 time EEG machine record brain activity . - Sessions 9-14 : Participants train control hand orthosis . The subject 's hand attach orthosis ask imagine performing finger hand movement . This continue 80-90 percent success rate achieve hand movement . - Sessions 15-16 : Participants repeat TMS fMRI comparison train hand orthosis . - Sessions 17-28 : Participants receive additional training hand orthosis device ( session 5-8 ) , focus hand part body . - Sessions 29-30 : Participants undergo repeat TMS fMRI compare effect follow additional training hand orthosis . - Sessions 31-32 : Optional makeup session need schedule problem . Participants evaluate clinic 3 month see benefit study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Individuals suffer stroke traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) may benefit development new rehabilitative intervention improve motor recovery injury . The purpose protocol test hypothesis oscillatory brain activity originate affect hemisphere form desynchronization Mu-rhythm patient chronic stroke TBI use drive movement orthosis attach paralyzed hand Brain Computer Interface ( BCI ) . Mu-rhythm type brain wave activity originates sensorimotor area brain control voluntarily ; present affect hemisphere stroke patient use control hand prosthesis BCI interface . Control Mu-rhythm amplitude volition require train since happen spontaneously . A proof-of-principle sub-experiment test hypothesis stroke survivor non-invasive cortical stimulation ipsilesional primary motor cortex ( M1 ) facilitate learn control hand orthosis BCI device . This purpose training : teach subject control Mu-rhythms . Study population : The study population consist individual chronic stroke TBI virtually movement paretic hand age- gender- match healthy volunteer . Healthy volunteer , may include age- gender- matched volunteer , recruit refine instruction give patient . Design : This primarily intraindividual comparison study , design determine brain-computer interface ( BCI ) approach contributes drive grasp motion BCI interface hand-orthosis . To test effect non-invasive cortical stimulation 21 stroke patient randomly assign three group ( group A , anodal stimulation ; group B , cathodal stimulation ; group C , sham stimulation ) . Study normal volunteer contribute ( ) set experiment , ( b ) identifying difference train time require modulate Mu-rhythm healthy volunteer patient ( c ) isolate training effect measure TMS fMRI healthy brain training effect brain affected stroke TBI . This information treat descriptively within framework protocol also important design future study . Outcome measure : Behavioral endpoint measure : ability drive paralyzed hand orthosis flexion extension motion use Mu-rhythm . Physiological endpoint measure : peak fMRI activity hand knob representation , corticomotor excitability test TMS MEG ipsilesional contralesional hand knob representation . Normal volunteer undergo evaluation physiological endpoint measure patient .</detailed_description>
