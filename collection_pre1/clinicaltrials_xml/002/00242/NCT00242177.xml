This trial test safety take daily ACTOS Relapsing Remitting MS ( RRMS ) patient , common form MS . Subjects take ACTOS non active pill ( placebo ) every day , trial safety drug test blood test certain enzymes relate liver function , glucose level , blood pressure measure , routine laboratory blood test carry . The safety ACTOS MS disease test neurological examination , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI , method give image damage MS cause brain ) , blood test make sure MS symptom make bad ACTOS . Findings ACTOS safe tolerate RRMS patient help provide basis design Phase II trial . 2 . Subjects select diagnosed RR-MS take drug Avonex Rebif treat MS symptom . Subjects randomize receive either ACTOS ( 30 mg ) non-active tablet ( placebo ) . Both subject investigator blind mean no-one know pill give . The subject take one pill daily mouth 18 month , length trial . During trial , subject examine 8 time . At visit 3 tablespoon ( 30cc ) blood take test . Subjects total 3 MRI scan do trial ( month 0 , 5 , 12 ) test ACTOS effect number size plaque brain . At visit subject also vital sign check , urine pregnancy test perform 3 . ACTOS cause fluid retention may cause increase risk heart damage . ACTOS cause mild weight gain anemia ( low hemoglobin level ) . ACTOS cause mild hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar level ) . ACTOS increase ovulation increase risk pregnancy . Since ACTOS structurally relate Troglitazone , associate liver damage rare case liver failure , patient treat ACTOS carefully monitor change liver enzyme level . In study ACTOS , common side effect upper respiratory tract infection , sinusitis , muscle pain , tooth disorder , sore throat , headache gas . ACTOS may side effect , heartburn , diarrhea , constipation , dizziness , abdominal fullness , nausea , loose stool . MRI FDA approve safe procedure . Possible risk include feeling anxiety claustrophobia , disturbance noise make procedure . A safe contrast agent ( gadolinium ) use MRI . Injection insertion needle may cause minor pain , bruising , and/or infection injection site . Gadolinium may cause brief discomfort , tingle , warmth lip , metallic taste mouth , tingle arm , nausea , headache . Very rarely , may allergic reaction . A standard questionnaire use determine safety patient MRI . Blood sample collection risk edema , swell , infection site withdrawal . We discuss consent form outline form candidate . 4 . There know benefit participate trial ; however knowledge gain may benefit others future . 5 . This trial recruit 30 RR MS patient .
