	<brief_summary>This study examine role epigenetics ( heritable change gene function occur without change DNA sequence ) age process . DNA primary genetic material , responsible transmit information one cell next one generation next . A second layer heredity describe term `` epigenetics . '' Epigenetic information reset one generation next . It work two way : 1 ) modification DNA , like balloon stick irregular interval onto side DNA helix encodes gene , 2 ) specialize protein shell wrap around region DNA . As DNA , shell copy transmit instruction . Because use turn gene , error setting cause critical misinformation transmit . Aging involve many change , muscle weakening , gray hair , skin wrinkling , forth . There several current theory age , include damage gene oxidation , shorten tiny structure end chromosome call telomere , ability stretch lifespan caloric restriction . This study investigate possible role epigenetics age examine compare shell-like epigenetic setting skin cell young adult old individual . Preliminary result earlier study show difference setting young old people . Women age 21 30 year 65 90 year undergo breast reduction mastectomy Suburban Hospital Bethesda , Maryland , may participate study . Tissue remove surgery pathological examination also use researcher study validate preliminary finding note continue study new area epigenetics age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Normal human lifespan mark complex series developmental event , relative stability adulthood , ultimately gradual decline viability . Biological clock presumably underlie developmental event occur childhood adolescence , nature clock remain obscure . Progress area would considerable importance , understand child development , also instability putative clock-like mechanism may occur part age process . Such instability could well compromise tissue function contribute many common degenerative disease later life . We propose investigate whether developmental clock relate aspect age process attributable part age-related epigenome remodeling . Experiments do date culture human fibroblast derive tissue bank provide tentative support hypothesis . To exclude tissue culture-related artifact continue work , essential access fresh tissue material form surgically obtain skin specimen would otherwise discard . Elective breast reduction mammoplasty frequently perform surgery Suburban Hospital , Bethesda , Maryland . Small skin specimen obtain procedure , well normal skin derive mastectomy . Patients undergo procedure ask sign consent form allow specimen , normally discard , use instead research mechanism age . They inform clinical information accompany specimen , include age know disease condition . Twenty patient two age range , 21-30 yr 65-90 yr , enrol study . The primary outcome confirmation age-related epigenome change chromosome 4q35.2 region , previously document use tissue bank-derived cultured skin fibroblast . Mapping sample chromatin region reveal high histone H4 acetylation young ( 24-30 yr ) old ( 80-85 yr ) individual . Confirmation change primary fibroblast follow detailed mapping chromatin structure extension beyond currently define limit . Secondary outcome include examination two area epigenome remodel appear occur birth adulthood , well search additional region age-related chromatin change .</detailed_description>
