	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) medical problem whose importance increase recognition awareness . OSA associate development hypertension cardiovascular disease ( 1,2 ) . OSA pathophysiologic characteristic know negatively impact immune function . Both sleep deprivation hypoxia , hallmarks OSA , impair immune response ( 6,8,11 ) . In addition , patient OSA frequently obese obesity may associate increase chance infection immune impairment ( 14,15 ) . Adipose cell know secrete cytokine hormone involve immune response leptin , tumor necrosis factor alpha interleukin-6 ( 16-19 ) . Thus , seem likely OSA may impact antigen-specific immune response . Although known characteristic OSA impact immune function , know effect clinical OSA immunity . The central hypothesis application patient obstructive sleep apnea attenuate cell-mediated humoral immune response influenza vaccine compare match control subject . Our hypothesis formulate basis patient OSA sleep deprive experience repeat hypoxemia negatively impact humoral cell-mediated immune response .</brief_summary>
