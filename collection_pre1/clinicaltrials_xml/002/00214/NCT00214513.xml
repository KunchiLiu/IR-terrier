	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Effect Low-Cost Maintenance Training Exercise Capacity , Quality Life Morbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Guidelines recommend physical training treatment patient CHF . Several study demonstrate even short-term training programme increase maximal oxygen intake , improve muscular strength , reduce neurohumoral activity result effect , potential benefit . Following 2-3 month train 70 – 80 % maximal capacity , improve exercise capacity oxygen uptake due increase cardiac output also well oxygen uptake peripheral muscle demonstrate . Moreover , study indicate improvement quality life ( QOL ) . However , effect exercise train rapidly lose without maintenance . Thus crucial question identify method sustain physical activity outside expensive , enthusiastic highly motivate protocol . The aim study determine whether low-cost home-based training programme maintain achieve effect physical training exercise capacity QOL patient Chronic Heart Failure . Comparison : Patients fulfil specified criterion Chronic Heart Failure randomise either eight week supervise group-based training ( 1.5 hr . ) twice week follow home-based training accord specify protocol supervise group-based training every 2 week ( 1,5 hr ) , eight week supervise training follow usual care . During whole period patient group contact Heart Failure Clinic need .</detailed_description>

If patient train team supervise one physiotherapist , e.g . due poor balance , patient exclude within first two week inclusion .</criteria>
