	<brief_summary>Aims Hypotheses : This randomise placebo control study test hypothesis Recombinant Activated Factor VII ( rVIIa ) improve haemostasis inadequate response conventional therapy complex cardiac surgery . Major bleeding still concern complex cardiac surgery . It show associated poorer patient outcome result consumption resource ( hospital cost , manpower blood bank reserve ) . This study potential provide evidence rVIIa reduce transfusion requirement improve patient outcome problematic aspect complicate cardiac surgery . The objective conduct multi-centre randomise placebo control study design scientifically evaluate treatment post bypass coagulopathy association complex cardiac surgery . The trial design base clinical practice evolve 2 year Austin Hospital 38 patient receive open label administration rVIIa . There currently publish RCT area TGA approval use rVIIa indication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>11 . 3 Methods Synopsis Study : A multicentred randomise , double blind , placebo-controlled trial evaluate efficacy safety activate recombinant factor VII ( rVIIa ) complex cardiac surgery . Study conduct Austin Hospital , Alfred Hospital Warringal Private Hospital . The study two arm : 1 . Those inadequate haemostasis initial standardised administration coagulation factor receive rVIIa . ( Active arm ) 2 . Those inadequate haemostasis initial standardised administration coagulation factor receive placebo . ( Placebo arm ) We anticipate preliminary series 50 % enrolled subject achieve haemostasis initial standardise dose coagulation factor therefore ’ receive trial medication . Identical data collect form observational subgroup analysis . The protocol allow open label administration rVIIa adequate haemostasis achieve two standardised administration coagulation factor trial medication . This would within 2 hour completion first administration Primary endpoint “ adequate haemostasis enable chest closure ” administration trial medication without need intervention improve coagulation . Secondary Endpoints , percentage case haemostasis first administration coagulation factor alone Assessment surgical field administration trial medication Time closure chest administration trial medication Transfusion requirement post bypass period theatre Transfusion requirement ICU first 12 hour Mediastinal drainage ICU first 12 hour Coagulation study result various sample time Requirement chest re-exploration Ventilation duration ICU Duration stay ICU Inclusion Criteria : Patients schedule cardiac surgery undergo follow procedure Double valve replacement repair . Major thoracic aortic surgery include hypothermic circulatory arrest descend aortic reconstruction . Valve repair replacement set endocarditis Complex procedures require cardiopulmonary bypass duration anticipate exceed 180 minute patient age ³70 year Exclusion Criteria : Patient unable give inform consent Patient refusal Allergy rVIIa Allergy aprotinin prior exposure within 6 month Pre-existing congenital coagulopathy Pre-existing hypercoagulable state Patients inclusion criterion whose actual bypass time exceed 180 minute Unresolved surgical bleeding Withdrawal Trial : At discretion treat physician propose transfusion protocol post CPB inadequate keep blood loss patient withdrawn trial . Transfusion therapy accord current medical practice discretion treat physician follow . rVIIa per current hospital guideline available . Data still collect group . Randomization Pharmacy randomise patient notify entry study . Blinded packaged trial medication send theatre . Surgical management Surgical technique discretion treat surgeon technique may affect haemostasis ( eg . Use biologic glue etc ) record . Anaesthetic management Choice anaesthetic agent discretion treat anaesthetist . All patient receive aprotinin 2 x 106 IV 1 hour test dose 10,000 unit 5 minute 2 x 106 IV CPB circuit prime . 0.75 x 106 IV infusion per hour . All patient haemofiltered bypass . Core temperature monitoring patient . Standard technique preserve patient temperature . Topical head cool use hypothermic circulatory arrest need . Cardiopulmonary bypass management Standardised CPB prime circuit Cell saver patient Cardiotomy return patient Haemoglobin maintain 6-8gm/dL bypass . Aim haemoglobin 10gm/dL time wean bypass . Units pack cell transfused bypass record . Adequate rewarming core temp &gt; 35° 20 minute . Alpha stat pH management . Acid-base pH 7.3-7.5 , BE +/- 3 prior wean bypass . Post bypass period Transfusion trial medication administration guideline find Flow Chart . Red Cell Transfusion Trigger Aim haemoglobin concentration 80 100 grams/litre use either bank wash red cell . The planned “ conventional therapy “ aprotinin initial administration predominately platelet ( 10 unit ) , cryoprecipitate 3 mls/kg ( high concentration fibrinogen ) moderate dose fresh frozen plasma 5ml/kg appropriate base clinical experience advice Australian Red Cross . If anytime adherence protocol discretion treat medical staff consider place patient risk inadequate transfusion , patient withdrawn transfusion commence determined medical staff . Data still collect patient . The duration protocol transfusion two hour . Either adequate haemostasis achieve intervention indicate protocol scenario inadequate haemostasis despite two administration standardise coagulation factor trial medication follow open label administration rVIIa evolve . If case , ongoing transfusion , surgical medical management discretion medical staff . Administration rVIIa consider discussion trial investigator . Data still collect patient . ICU Management Blood loss measurement close drainage system must document least hourly , frequently blood loss excessive . The patient sit bed arrival ICU ( allow CXR take ) , start measure drainage . On arrival ICU coagulation study perform repeat 4 hour 12 hour post arrival . . Postoperative transfusion accord establish ICU protocol Blood loss &gt; 250mL/hr NOTIFY SURGEON ( CONSIDER RETURN TO THEATRE ) CONSISTANT WITH CURRENT PRACTICE : - NO ADMINISTRATION OF rVIIa IN ICU Re-exploration bleed Any patient return theatre treat discretion medical staff involve . The administration rVIIa consider accord current guideline . Administration coagulation product discretion treat doctor . Randomisation co-ordinated supervise Trial Pharmacy Austin Hospital . Due expense drug , instability solution lack availability similarly package placebo , mechanism “ blind ” medical staff theatre involve independent registered nurse prepare drug opaque syringe accord seal envelope indicate placebo trial drug . Randomisation site specific Austin Hospital Warringal Private Hospital . Pharmacy notify consent obtain patient . Two dos rVIIa need send theatre . This store blood fridge . Any unused drug return Pharmacy full documentation drug handling . Nursing staff involve trial medication preparation educate regard necessity reveal whether actual drug placebo use . Statistics Power Analysis Based pilot data anticipate 80 % group receive rVIIa achieve haemostasis adequate chest closure without intervention improve coagulation . ( Our primary endpoint ) We conservatively estimate 30 % less placebo group achieve haemostasis adequate chest closure without intervention improve coagulation . Assuming p value &lt; 0.5 power 0.8 analysis indicate show 50 % difference group 34 subject need ( 17 arm ) . To allow withdrawal plan enrol 40 patient study . Based current drug usage , recruitment take 2 year . Results Analysis Primary endpoint assess chi-squared analysis . Secondary endpoint parametric non-parametric analysis appropriate . No interim analysis plan . Subgroup analysis accord procedure surgeon perform . Bias Because small number subject trial , bias may problem . Unequal distribution four procedure may occur influence result . The trial drug think treat coagulopathic bleeding . Any superimposed surgical bleeding may cause bias . Adverse Events Patients undergo cardiac surgery represent population relatively high risk range perioperative complication inherent underlying disease , co-morbidities nature surgery undertaken . In pilot study mortality rate 25 % . It intend report occurrence event Human Research Ethics Committee . Any adverse event arise specifically relation conduct propose study report Committee Feasibility Our pilot series 40 case 2 centre collect 24-month period . Assuming similar workload addition another centre ( Alfred Hospital ) recruitment complete 24 month . HREC approval grant Austin Health Austin site . The HREC consider approval Warringal Private Hospital site , Alfred hospital seek similar approval HREC .</detailed_description>
