	<brief_title>Effects Swallowing Therapy Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients head neck cancer treat chemoradiation and/or surgical resection may exhibit variety swallow difficulty due reduce range motion ( ROM ) result absence alteration structure involve deglutition . Chemoradiation protocols receive increase attention treatment head neck cancer . The primary focus regimens disease control organ spar . Preservation oropharyngeal anatomy , however , equate preservation function . Due severity frequency swallow problem population , critical effectiveness dysphagia ( i.e . swallow disorder ) rehabilitation protocol preservation and/or restoration function determine . In absence potential remediation , patient may reject organ preservation treatment protocol negative functional side effect . There number therapeutic exercise design improve swallow show positive effect head neck cancer patient dysphagic result treatment surgery and/or chemoradiation . The short- long-term effectiveness exercise define . The purpose study compare effectiveness combine ROM postural sensory therapy swallow dysfunction postural sensory therapy alone . By maximize effectiveness therapy , expect improved swallowing function translate well quality life enjoyment meal improve nutrition hydration critical health sense well individual recover head neck cancer . To include , subject must 21 80 year old undergone treatment head neck cancer form chemoradiation , and/or one follow specific type head neck cancer surgery : supraglottic laryngectomy , anterior resection primary skin graft closure , anterior resection distal free flap closure , posterior resection primary skin graft closure , posterior resection distal free flap . Potential subject must diagnose Stage I-IV disease also available twice-weekly swallow therapy session . Furthermore , subject must available 12 month study . No subject include history medical problem may affect swallowing , speech , voice , neurological problem , gastroenterological problem , health problem determine patient 's physician investigator . Patients prior treat cancer head neck , receive total laryngectomy operation also eligible .</detailed_description>
