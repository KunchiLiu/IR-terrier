	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : -This study represent progression finding four previous NCI ROB protocol ( 02-C-0167A , 02-C-0207E , 03-C-0190B , 04-C-0171 ) . In previous work begin develop technique obtain Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) biological image co-register tissue prostate cancer patient . OBJECTIVES : -The primary objective first portion study ass feasibility use IMRT treat at-risk lymph node prostate cancer . Also , feasible , hope optimize technique experience . ELIGIBILITY : -This study image guide , target radiation therapy patient high risk nodal metastasis prostate cancer . Patients prostate cancer 15 % risk lymph node ( define Partin table ) metastasis eligible study . DESIGN : - On first 10 patient , perform approximately 5CT simulation throughout course therapy . On simulation , initial treatment plan re-run . The dose-volume data target normal tissue re-analyzed . From analysis well able determine size margin need account organ motion change vary amount gas bowel fluid bladder . To best knowledge , analyse publish . - If initial part trial feasible , proceed phase I dose escalation trial radiation at-risk lymph node . The primary statistical objective phase I portion study estimate Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) external beam radiation base evaluate acute toxicity . The study conduct dose-escalation design 3 patient dose cohort . If few 2 3 patient experience acute DLT patient accrue next dose cohort . If 2 3 patient experience DLT MTD exceed prior , low dose cohort consider MTD . Secondary objective study relate pattern gene protein expression response toxicity evaluate frequency late term toxicity . - Specific procedure risk describe separate consent obtain time biopsy . Tissue sample process cDNA microarray test stored future analysis Radiation Oncology Branch , NCI . - Anatomic Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) MR biological image prostate pelvis obtain tissue acquire biopsy location precisely translate ( co-registered ) MR image reference . A fiducial marker ( gold seed ) leave biopsy site fiducial marker direct future radiation therapy prostate . If necessary , additional fiducial marker place prostate localization treatment .</brief_summary>
