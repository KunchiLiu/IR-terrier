	<brief_title>Asthma Intervention Research ( AIR ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter , randomize , control clinical trial conduct 11 Investigational Sites 4 country ( Canada , United Kingdom , Denmark , Brazil ) . Subjects underwent Baseline evaluation , Alair treatment Control Visits , follow-up evaluation 12-Weeks , 6-Months , 12-Months last Treatment Control Visit . In order maximize power study , Baseline Follow-up test conduct 2 part . In first part subject continued take asthma maintenance medication ( inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) long act β2-agonists ( LABA ) test period . This designated `` ON-LABA '' Phase . Following ON-LABA test subject ask abstain LABA second part test , result designate `` OFF-LABA '' Phase .</detailed_description>
