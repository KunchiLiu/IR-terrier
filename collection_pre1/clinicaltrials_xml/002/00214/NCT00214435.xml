	<detailed_description>Rationale : ‘ TEddI ’ enable once-daily treatment strategy study provide information effectiveness , patient adherence quality life tolerability regimens . Hypothesis : The study hypothesis antiretroviral regimen comprise three agent take daily high level adherence regimen require frequent dosing . Primary objective : To determine 24 week level adherence two group HIV-infected subject randomise receive either daily minimum 3-drug regimen continue minimum 3-drug regimen require frequent dosing . Secondary objective : The secondary objective study include : - To estimate proportion patient treatment failure treatment failure define : - HIV-1 RNA viral load &gt; 400 copies/ml two consecutive occasion one month apart , OR - Discontinuation treatment reason ( subsequent therapy comply study regimen change guideline outline section 3.3.3 ) - Proportion patient plasma HIV-RNA le 50 copies/ml ( use ultrasensitive assay ) 24 48 week - Change baseline CD4 cell count 24 48 week - Changes baseline subject ’ quality life 24 48 week - Changes baseline base DASS 21 score 24 48 week - Incidence severity adverse event abnormal laboratory value ( grade 3 &amp; 4 ) 24 48 week - Proportion patient remain assigned treatment Study Design This randomised , open-label , multi-centre , prospective , 48-week study compare 3 ( ) drug once-daily antiretroviral regimen 3 ( ) drug regimen least 1 drug must take least twice daily . One hundred twenty ( 120 ) subject recruit randomise 1:1 ratio one two open-label treatment regimen continue receive randomise treatment week 24 : Arm 1 : ( Once daily arm ) commence treatment once-a-day combination license antiviral medication ( EFV/ddI/3TC , EFV/3TC/TDF ATV/3TC/TDF ) . Arm 2 : ( Continuation arm ) continue current ART ( minimum 3-drugs ) dose twice daily frequently Following week 24 , patient option continue randomise treatment 24 week switch daily treatment arm . In case , patient follow 48 week baseline visit .</detailed_description>
