	<brief_title>A Study AT1001 Patients With Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label study conduct 20 patient five clinical site United States . Patients undergo 28-day screening period , include 14-day run-in AT1001 ass eligibility study . Patients receive enzyme replacement therapy substrate depletion therapy Fabry disease must undergo 2-week washout prior therapy 28-day screening period . Patients receive daily dose AT1001 12 week treatment phase . The pharmacokinetics AT1001 plasma urine assess regular interval . Safety evaluate throughout treatment period . At end 12-week treatment period , effect AT1001 pharmacodynamic parameter ( alpha-Gal A leukocyte , GL-3 plasma urine , alpha-Gal A GL-3 skin biopsy sample ) functional parameter ( cardiac function assess electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , MRI , renal function assess blood urine test , nerve conduction assess QSART CASE IV test ) evaluate . If safety profile acceptable , patient permit enter 36-week treatment extension period continue receive AT1001 , safety , pharmacodynamic , functional assessment perform 12-week interval .</detailed_description>
