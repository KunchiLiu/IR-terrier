	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study potent anti-secretory therapy high dose PPI improve asthma control regardless either asthma severity presence GERD symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Effects Asthma Control Rabeprazole Given Twice Daily Subjects With Asthma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patient GERD experience heartburn symptom . Barium esophagram , endoscopy and/or overnight esophageal pH monitor commonly rely upon objectively establish diagnosis GERD . In general , overnight esophageal pH monitoring sensitive specific test available confirm GERD . However , literature explore GERD cause chronic cough suggest currently accept criterion define abnormal overnight esophageal pH may adequately sensitive . It therefore possible aggressive GERD therapy may improve asthma control patient `` normal '' overnight esophageal pH probe result . To knowledge , publish data address question . Primary Objective The primary objective compare asthma control asthmatic subject treat high dose PPI asthmatic subject take placebo PPI . The primary outcome variable measurement asthma symptom asthma quality life . Secondary Objectives Secondary objective include evaluate effect aggressive anti-secretory therapy lung function , asthma medication use ( include baseline rescue medication ) , GERD symptom . An additional secondary objective evaluate whether presence absence GERD symptom baseline ( prior proton pump inhibitor therapy ) independently associate improvement outcome measure . Measurements include : Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire ( visit 2 5 ) , Juniper Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( visit 2 - 5 ) , GSAS gastroesophageal reflux instrument ( visit 2 , visit 5 ) , occurrence adverse event , change FVC , FEF25-75 % , MIF50 / MEF50 , peak expiratory flow rate , FEV1 reversibility , physical exam . Additional measurement include methacholine challenge eosinophilia induce sputum specimen . Induced sputum offer patient , though anticipate approximately 50 % agree procedure .</detailed_description>
