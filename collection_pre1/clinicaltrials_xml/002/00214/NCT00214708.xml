	<brief_title>Can Screening People Registering With Primary Care Improve Detection Tuberculosis ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , study screen tuberculosis use relatively weak design . A randomised trial would give strong evidence whether screen worthwhile therefore would welcome . We test feasibility screen two general practice Hackney ; result suggest simple straightforward , people screen comfortable take part , screen indeed identify people tuberculosis . How ( indeed whether ) screen tuberculosis constitute major policy issue inner city public health care . Our work go way toward answer important question local , national international relevance . There important benefit take part . First , project part local health development scheme encourages GPs register refugee asylum seeker . This mean group people find difficult get health care likely able find GP . Second , people register general practice screen brief discussion tuberculosis attend health check surgery . This make people inform tuberculosis help remove stigma attends tuberculosis . Third , screen likely identify people tuberculosis , need BCG vaccination prevent tuberculosis . These people benefit early treatment immunisation . We invite general practice Hackney take part . Practices agree randomly allocate ( computer programme ) two group : practice screen carry usual without screen . The project researcher responsible data collection know group practice assign . Practices allocate screen group offer programme design encourage screen part new patient registration check ( practice nurse GPs ) child 's transfer-in visit ( health visitor ) . The programme found proven way help people change work include follow : education programme run primary care research team , local chest consultant opinion leader ; Heaf gun , Heaf head , tuberculin ( test presence TB ) ; TB screen guideline ; regular support advice local TB specialist nurse ; incorporation TB screening template practice computer consult system ; incentive fee pay practice carry Heaf test . TB identication rate group ascertain 25 month screen . The cost implement screen process also measure . Patients / public involvment ( subject partner ) : People attend new registration check child see transfer-in visit study participant . They inform study ( use information sheet various language ) ; decline take part like . Public involvement design execution study come three form . First , East London Refuge Asylum seeker worker contribute study design involve throught study . Second , work part East London Health Improvement Plan , public support . Third , study approval East London Esssex Network Researchers â€™ Research Advisory Committee , two consumer representative</detailed_description>
