	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether bifocal soft contact lens effective control progression myopia child adolescent exhibit tendency excessively cross eye read ( esophoria eso fixation disparity ) . Several study demonstrate bifocal progressive multifocal spectacle effective slow progression myopia child either near point esophoria and/or inadequate focusing near . A prominent theory one cause myopia progression poorly focus image back eye ( retina ) cause eye lengthen , cause increase myopia . Bifocal contact lens may reduce retinal defocus , reduce stimulus eye elongation , thus may reduce myopia progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Myopia become focus grow attention concern prevalence myopia appear increase population ( reach 90 % university student population Asia ) . There serious risk higher level myopia , include cataract , glaucoma , retinal detachment myopic retinal degeneration . Several study show mild moderate control myopia progressionwith bifocal multifocal spectacle child esophoria near and/or accommodative deficiency . Pilot study P.I . suggest bifocal contact lens may control myopia progression child near point eso fixation disparity . CONTROL control , randomize , prospective , double-blind , one year study change myopia 80-90 subject age 8-18 low moderate level myopia , low level astigmatism , eso fixation disparity near , fit either bifocal soft contact lenses single vision soft contact lens . The primary outcome measure cycloplegic refraction axial length measure .</detailed_description>
