Patients neuropathic pain etiology may qualify study permission Cephalon medical monitor designee . The patient currently use 1 follow : least 60 mg oral morphine/day , least 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour , atleast 30 mg oxycodone/day , least 8 mg hydromorphone/day , equianalgesic dose another opioid/day stable dose aroundtheclose ( ATC ) therapy least previous 7 day enrollment study . The patient report average pain intensity ( PI ) score , prior 24 hour , less 7 ( 0=no pain 10=worst pain ) chronic neuropathic pain . The patient experience , average , 1 4 BTP episode ( define temporary flare sever excruciate pain ) per day take ATC opioid therapy , average , duration BTP episode le 4 hour . The patient currently use opioid therapy alleviation BTP episodes , occur location chronic pain , achieve least partial relief . The patient able effectively selfadminister study drug . Patients exclude participate study 1 follow criterion meet : The patient uncontrolled rapidly escalate pain determine investigator ( ie , ATC therapy may expect change first last treatment study drug ) , pain uncontrolled therapy could adversely impact safety patient could compromise treatment study drug . The patient know suspected hypersensitivity , allergy , contraindication ingredient study drug . The patient recent history ( within 5 year ) current evidence alcohol substance abuse . The patient cardiopulmonary disease would , opinion investigator , significantly increase risk treatment potent synthetic opioids .
