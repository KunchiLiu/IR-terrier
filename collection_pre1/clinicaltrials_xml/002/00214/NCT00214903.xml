The primary objective study , European Active Surveillance Study Women take HRT ( EURAS-HRT ) , compare incidence rate serious adverse event user type newly prescribe oral continuous combine HRT product . This active surveillance study assess pertinent cardiovascular outcomes new HRT user study period 8.5 year . Also , serious adverse event report . The new drug product surveillance EURAS - HRT study contains novel synthetic progestagen drospirenone ( DRSP ) combine estradiol . As estrogen/progestagen combination increase risk thromboembolism , new drug product contain novel estrogen progestagen investigate influence venous arterial thromboembolic event rate . A large , prospective , control cohort study OC user ( EURAS OC study ) , compare DRSP-containing OC user OC user , demonstrate DRSP associate increased incidence above-mentioned adverse event OC user . However , OC user two three decade young typical HRT user result OC study partially extrapolate old age group . The participate woman complete baseline survey use self-administered questionnaire describe baseline risk . After 6 month , 12 month , annual basis , fill questionnaire record complaints event use prescribe HRTs . All adverse outcome ( include cancer ) occur observational period evaluate additionally . Reported serious adverse event validate analyzed . As study participant may switch oral continuous combine product oral non-oral HRT product outcomes preparation record . However , result represent scientific focus study . Based experience obtain previous HRT study , complex source bias confound expect .
