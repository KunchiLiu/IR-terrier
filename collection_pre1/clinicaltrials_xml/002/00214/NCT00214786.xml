	<detailed_description>The purpose study ass novel approach immunosuppression allogenic pancreatic islet cell transplant recipient . In addition , study aim assess remote site islet processing culture pancreatic islet cell transplantation human subject . Detailed Description : Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) type I disease significant social economical impact . The prevalence disease United States 120,000 individual age 19 less 300,000 500,000 age 150 million worldwide . So far mechanical device able effectively adjust dose insulin inject accord serum glucose patient DM . This lead less perfect sugar control , episodes hypoglycemia . Successful pancreas transplantation averts need insulin administration . The emerge alternative whole organ pancreas transplantation pancreatic islet cell transplantation ( ICT ) . The process base enzymatic isolation pancreatic islet organ procure cadaver donor . The islet obtain inject liver recipient via percutaneous catheterization portal venous system . This procedure allow selective transplantation insulin-producing cell population avoid open surgery well transplantation duodenum exocrine pancreas related morbidity . The initial effort ICT modest result . The immunosuppression regimen similar one use solid organ transplantation , base high dose steroid calcineurin inhibitor - agent diabetogenic effect . The result improve markedly change manipulation islet , change immunosuppression thus avoid high dos steroid use sirolimus , tacrolimus daclizumab initiate investigator group University Alberta Edmonton , Canada . Their protocol require general two islet cell infusion order attain critical cell mass necessary achieve insulin-independency . The change treatment adopt Edmonton Protocol , use several transplant center , worldwide . A novel approach organ preservation use two-layer preservation technique . This allow long travel time eventual shipment pancreas islet cell processing facility remotely locate donor procurement site . The isolation islet donor pancreas perform Diabetes Research Institute Miami , Florida , accord standard currently use institution . The Diabetes Research Institute well-established center state-of-the-art islet cell isolation facility purpose transplantation human , accredit monitor FDA accord FDA standard . The focus research ICT center development safe effective procedure eventually replace surgical pancreas transplantation together ideal immunosuppressive regimen provide safe effective prevention rejection , minimize adverse event associate negatively impact transplant recipient 's quality life . This study conduct validation Edmonton protocol ICT institution . Our aim test efficacy use two-layer preservation technique transport donor pancreas off-site processing facility use islet cell culture off-site processing facility islet isolate ship center .</detailed_description>
