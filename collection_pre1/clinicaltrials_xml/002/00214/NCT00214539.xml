	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy Alair System treatment severe refractory asthma . This multicenter , randomize control study compare effect treatment Alair System standard drug therapy patient severe asthma refractory standard medication therapy .

	<brief_title>Research Severe Asthma ( RISA ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter , randomize , clinical trial conduct 8 Investigational Sites 3 country . Subjects Alair group administer Alair treatment 3 separate bronchoscopy session , subject Control group complete 3 `` Control Visits '' Physicians office , time coincide 3 treatment bronchoscopy session . Following completion three procedure Control Visits subject evaluate 6 week 12 week . All subject remain maintenance asthma medication evaluate 22 week last procedure Control Visit . This phase last procedure Control Visit 22 Weeks last procedure Control Visit term Steroid Stable Phase . Subjects undergo 14 week period 22 Weeks 36 Weeks ( term Steroid Wean Phase ) attempt make wean either maintenance inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , take maintenance oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) , oral steroid . If subject tolerate steroid reduction particular level ( evidenced loss asthma control ) , stabilize last tolerable dose steroid . All subject maintain reduce steroid dosage end Steroid Wean Phase 36 week final evaluation end Study 52 week ( term Reduced Steroid Phase ) . All subject exit study follow completion 52 week evaluation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ambulatory adult ; age 1865 year Asthma require regular maintenance medication include high dose inhale corticosteroid AND long act β2 agonist ( LABA ) without asthma maintenance medication . Oral prednisone ≤30 mg/day , leukotriene modifier , theophylline asthma control drug may prescribe physician 's discretion . Prebronchodilator force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) ≥50 % predict ( patient stabilize inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) long act β2 agonist ) PC20 &lt; 4 mg/ml per methacholine inhalation test use standardize method , patient prebronchodilator FEV1 ≥60 % predict ( FEV1 &gt; low limit define individual hospital protocol ) . PC20 provocative concentration Provocholine® ( brand methacholine chloride ) result drop FEV1 20 % Baseline Reversible bronchoconstriction 12 month prior enrollment , demonstrate increase FEV1 least 12 % 30 minute 4 puff shortacting β2 agonist , patient prebronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 60 % predict ( FEV1 &lt; low limit define individual hospital protocol ) Patient must symptomatic , despite medication high dose inhale corticosteroid LABA , least one following : 1 .
