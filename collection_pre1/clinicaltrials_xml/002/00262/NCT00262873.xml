	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy bortezomib , term reduce cytopenia , patient myelodysplastic syndrome . - Determine safety toxic effect drug patient . Secondary - Determine change marrow blast percentage karyotypic profile patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
