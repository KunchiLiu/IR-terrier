	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Colony-stimulating factor , GM-CSF , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood may help immune system recover side effect chemotherapy kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may kill remain tumor cell . Sometimes , surgery , tumor may need additional treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well GM-CSF combination chemotherapy work treat patient undergo surgery stage II stage III colon cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GM-CSF Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery Stage II Stage III Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety neoadjuvant adjuvant sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) adjuvant chemotherapy patient resectable stage II III colon cancer . - Determine efficacy , term enhance tumor-associated macrophage response , regimen patient . Secondary - Determine overall survival time progression patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : - Neoadjuvant therapy surgery : Patients receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) daily begin day -16 -12 continue day -1 . Patients undergo surgical resection day 0 . Patients stage I IV disease remove study . All patient proceed adjuvant chemotherapy observation . - Adjuvant chemotherapy observation : Patients high-risk stage II stage III disease assign group 1 2 . Patients low-risk stage II disease assign group 3 . - Group 1 ( adjuvant therapy high-risk stage II disease ) : Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 36 . Patients also receive GM-CSF SC daily day 50-54 . Treatment repeat every 56 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Group 2 ( adjuvant therapy stage III disease ) : Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy GM-CSF group 1 . Alternatively , patient may receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV 46 hour begin day 1 . These patient also receive GM-CSF SC daily day 10-14 every fourth course . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Group 3 ( low-risk stage II disease ) : Patients undergo observation every 3 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
