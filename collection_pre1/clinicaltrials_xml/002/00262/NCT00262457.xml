	<detailed_description>The overall goal project implement use gluteal stimulation system incorporate BION microstimulators pressure ulcer prevention patient high risk tissue breakdown standard clinical practice.The specific goal study establish feasibility system incorporate BION microstimulators long term use . This achieve two phase study . The initial phase study employ biomechanical test in-vitro evaluation address issue safety system design . The specific task achieve initial phase : Biomechanical test characterize device response traumatic loading condition . In-vitro test determine optimal configuration system , specifically effect BION orientation placement relative coil . A series cadaveric study determine guideline BION implantation procedure require achieve optimal function gluteal stimulation system . The second phase study pilot clinical trail veteran reduce mobility order establish clinical utility . A two-arm crossover study wheelchair user carry . A total 10 subject recruit study . Participants randomly assign Group A Group B . All subject receive BION microstimulators implant bilaterally adjacent motor point gluteus maximus . Two stimulation regime employ ; condition stimulation apply night increase muscle strength fatigue resistance stimulate muscle dynamic stimulation employ day order facilitate regular weight shifting , thus vary seat posture pressure distribution seat interface . Subjects Group A start use dynamic conditioning stimulation concurrently 6 month follow implantation . They cease use stimulation 6 month participation study . Group B activate stimulation system 6 month follow implantation . They commence use dynamic conditioning stimulation 6 month . All subject follow 12 month period follow implantation . Tissue health assessment carry three month interval throughout participation study . Progressive change gluteal tissue health assess : 1 . Transcutaneous oxygen measurement measure tissue blood flow . 2 . Interface pressure measurement determine pressure distribution change long-term ( due muscle change ) short-term ( due muscle contraction ) . 3 . Computerized tomography ( CT ) measure muscle thickness . The result study provide pilot data development full-scale clinical trial gluteal BION system .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Motor sensory complete spinal cord injury level T12 . No open skin problem hospitalization three month prior entrance study . Age le 18 year . Less two year postinjury loss independent walk ability . More three urinary tract infection previous year . Significant active systemic disease , e.g . heart disease , renal failure , diabetes . Abnormal nutritional status base albumin total protein level recruitment ( 3.0 albumin , 6.0 total protein ) . Osteomyelitis pelvic region , indicate positive pelvic inlet Xray routine annual urologic examination bone scan . Previous surgery perineal region radically alters basic anatomy , particularly regional innervation blood supply , e.g . amputation , hemipelvectomy . Extensive low motor neuron damage motor nerve innervate gluteal muscle electrical excitability gluteal muscle low motor neuron innervation insufficient produce desire level contraction .</criteria>
