	<brief_summary>Glaucoma disease affect one two percent individual age 40 year . According recent Canadian National Institute Blind figure , second large specific cause blindness country . The common form glaucoma , open-angle glaucoma , incipient typically result progressive loss vision without symptom due damage structure inside eye call optic nerve head . Although important know risk factor development open-angle glaucoma high intraocular pressure ( pressure within eyeball ) , number researcher show sizeable proportion patient continue lose vision spite successful treatment low intraocular pressure . This finding suggest may additional risk factor involve . Ocular vasospasm ( inability certain blood vessel dilate increase blood flow accord need eye ) vascular disease among factor implicate role yet fully investigate . The Canadian Glaucoma Study Group propose investigate role risk factor , include vasospasm vascular disease , involve progression open-angle glaucoma . We recruit 410 patient open-angle glaucoma across 4 centre ( Halifax , Vancouver , Montreal Toronto ) treat experienced investigative ophthalmologist accord uniform standard protocol ensure patient manage manner . The patient follow meticulously modern accurate test available every four month period 5 year determine whether progression take place . Visual function measure use two technique call conventional perimetry blue-on-yellow perimetry , optic nerve head examine special scanner capable three-dimensional imaging . By define ocular systemic profile patient progress progress , may able identify patient benefit standard treatment intraocular pressure reduction , prescribe study . More importantly , identify characteristic patient benefit standard treatment , alternative one may develop . Such study clearly necessary , yet conduct . We believe propose study increase knowledge open-angle glaucoma reduce impact blindness visual disability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Elevated intraocular pressure important know risk factor development progression open-angle glaucoma . While pressure reduction beneficial many case , significant proportion patient continue progress despite clinically acceptable pressure level . Many investigator find difference pressure characteristic progress non-progressing patient , highlight current inability identify patient respond pressure reduction . It likely inability stem poor understanding risk factor , ocular systemic , progression probability glaucoma disease multiple pathogenic mechanism . In application Canadian Glaucoma Study Group propose multi-centre prospective study objective characterising risk factor associate progression open-angle glaucoma . We determine sub-groups patient regard type progression , thereby allow u identify ocular systemic profile patient likely likely benefit intraocular pressure reduction . Our hypothesis : ( ) The relationship intraocular pressure characteristic follow-up survival rate regard progression open-angle glaucoma weak . ( ii ) Patients vasospasm high survival rate patient without vasospasm clinical management prescribed study . ( iii ) Patients vascular disease lower survival rate patient without vascular disease clinical management prescribed study . We test hypothesis follow total 410 patient 4 centre ( Halifax , Vancouver , Montreal Toronto ) every 4 month period 5 year use uniform protocol clinical management study procedure . Clinical management involve least 30 % reduction intraocular pressure baseline untreated value , follow additional 20 % great reduction progressive event . The study procedure include conventional perimetry , blue-on-yellow perimetry scan laser tomography optic nerve head nerve fibre layer . We measure finger blood flow heat cold provocation ass patient ’ susceptibility vasospasm also obtain haematological , biochemical rheological profile assess presence vascular disease . Progression either visual field optic nerve head damage term progressive event occur predefined change baseline . Events define separately technique base percentile empirically derive value test-retest variability , allow degree standardisation technique . Comparison survival time group ( e.g . vasospastic non-vasospastic ) make Cox ’ survivorship analysis repeat measure model . Where appropriate , group comparison make group t-test Mann-Whitney test . If characterise fully risk factor glaucomatous progression , may able identify ocular systemic profile patient benefit current treatment pressure reduction . More importantly , identify profile patient respond poorly pressure reduction future research effort lead development implementation alternative therapy . We believe significant study result well understand open-angle glaucoma help reduce impact blindness visual disability .</detailed_description>
