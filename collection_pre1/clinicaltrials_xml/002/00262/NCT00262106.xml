However , association N-9 product belong class ( surfactant ) genital epithelial disruption , histologically determine genital inflammation , reduction population vaginal lactobacillus lead concern use could enhance risk HIV transmission . Early Phase 3 study N-9 product yield conflict result , recently , multicenter randomize placebo-controlled trial low dose N-9 formulation demonstrate increased incidence HIV infection N-9 group compare placebo . These finding intensify effort develop agent favorable toxicity profile . At least four entered trial assess effectiveness prevent vaginally acquire HIV infection : Buffer Gel , Carraguard , cellulose sulfate PRO 2000/5 Gel . Protocol MDP 301 describes randomize placebo-controlled trial design explore safety efficacy two concentration PRO 2000/5 Gel . Participant recruitment follow-up complete .
