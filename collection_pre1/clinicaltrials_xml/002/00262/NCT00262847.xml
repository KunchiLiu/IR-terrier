	<brief_title>Carboplatin Paclitaxel With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine addition 5 concurrent cycle bevacizumab 6 cycle standard therapy ( carboplatin paclitaxel ) ( Arm II ) increase duration progression-free survival ( PFS ) compare 6 cycle standard therapy alone ( Arm I ) woman newly diagnose stage III ( gross residual disease ) stage IV , epithelial ovarian , peritoneal primary fallopian tube cancer . II . To determine addition 5 concurrent cycle bevacizumab plus extended bevacizumab 16 cycle beyond 6 cycle standard therapy ( carboplatin paclitaxel ) ( Arm III ) increase progression-free survival compare 6 cycle standard therapy ( Arm I ) woman newly diagnose stage III ( gross residual disease ) stage IV , epithelial ovarian , peritoneal primary fallopian tube cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . In event Arm II Arm III regimens superior Arm I regimen respect progression-free survival , determine whether Arm III regimen prolong progression-free survival compare Arm II regimen . II . To determine whether Arm II Arm III regimen increase duration overall survival compare Arm I regimen . III . To compare experimental regimen Arm I regimen respect incidence severe toxicity serious adverse event . IV . To determine impact Quality Life ( QOL , measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Ovarian [ FACT-O ] trial outcome index [ TOI ] ) follow treatment regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess relationship angiogenic marker clinical outcome include tumor response , progression-free survival overall survival patient randomized standard cytotoxic chemotherapy ( paclitaxel carboplatin ) without bevacizumab , concurrent bevacizumab extend bevacizumab . II . To assess predictive value set gene whose expression correlate survival patient stage III ( gross residual disease ) stage IV , epithelial ovarian , peritoneal primary fallopian tube cancer . III . To bank whole blood research . IV . To determine genetic variation gene associate essential hypertension include WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1 ( WNK1 ) , G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 ( GRK4 ) kallikrein B ( KLKB1 ) predict patient likely develop bevacizumab-induced hypertension . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive placebo IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Beginning course 7 , patient receive placebo alone IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment placebo repeat every 21 day 22 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel carboplatin arm I . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Beginning course 7 , patient receive placebo alone IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment placebo repeat every 21 day 22 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive paclitaxel carboplatin arm I . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Beginning course 7 , patient receive bevacizumab alone IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment bevacizumab repeat every 21 day 22 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
