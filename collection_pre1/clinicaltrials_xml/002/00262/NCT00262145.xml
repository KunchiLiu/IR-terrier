	<brief_summary>Objective - A variety herbal , over-the-counter preparation tea leaf say reduce rate absorption fat ( allegedly via inhibition pancreatic lipase ) carbohydrate ( via inhibition carbohydrate digestion block glucose transport intestinal mucosa ) . There study ability product reduce blood glucose increase observe carbohydrate meal reduce blood cholesterol level chronic study . The purpose present study objectively determine one cup “ tea ” make combination three type tea leaf ( mulberry , black green tea ) cause malabsorption carbohydrate fat take conjunction tea . Research Design - The study consist double blind , placebo control crossover study 20 healthy subject . On one two day ( one week apart ) subject ingest standard meal consist 30 g sucrose ( tea ) 30 g starch form white rice plus 10 g fat butter . To measure triglyceride absorption , meal also contain 250 mg 13-C label triolein . Triolein commonly ingest fat consist glycerol bind three oleic acid . 13-C stable ( non-radioactive ) isotope carbon . On one test day subject ( randomly ) concurrently consume active preparation , tea contain extract three type tea leave describe plus meal , test day consume meal liquid placebo preparation ( warm water , sugar food color ) . Subjects provide breath sample hourly interval 8 hour ingestion meal . Carbohydrate malabsorption determine hydrogen concentration breath sample fat malabsorption concentration 13-CO2 breath sample . Clinical Significance - An increase breath hydrogen indicate carbohydrate malabsoption low 13-CO2 indicates lipid malabsorption . Objective evidence tea leaf extract actually induce carbohydrate and/or fat malabsorption could provide basis study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ability Tea Leaf Extracts Preparation Slow Down Carbohydrate Fat Absorption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One commonly cite beneficial effect tea ability induce weight loss . Support contention include control human trial show increased weight loss tea add dietary regimen , mouse study demonstrate administration tea extract high fat diet eliminate weight gain observe absence tea . Several different mechanism postulate account weight control . Multiple study report modest increase energy expenditure associate ingestion oolong green tea . In addition , tea could inhibit absorption carbohydrate and/or fat . Studies support possibility carbohydrate malabsorption include vitro study show constituent tea inhibit activity carbohydrate digest enzyme ( α-amylase α-glucosidase , mucosal uptake glucose via interaction sodium dependent glucose transporter . The vitro demonstration tea extract inhibit pancreatic lipase activity suggest tea might interfere triglyceride absorption . However , vivo study human animal show tea preparation actually capable cause malabsorption either carbohydrate fat . In present study , utilized measurement breath H2 13CO2 investigate ability mixture black , green mulberry tea leaf extract induce malabsorption carbohydrate fat healthy volunteer . Protocol - The study group consist 20 healthy volunteer ( age 23 52 , 10 female 10 male ) . The subject fast usual dinner day precede study follow morning ( approximately 8 ) experiment perform . After collection baseline breath sample H2 13CO2 analysis , subject ingest test meal consist cook white rice butter . The rice boil for20 minute , individual portion ( 176 g , contain 50 g carbohydrate ) weigh frozen 10g butter . Immediately prior ingestion , meal warm microwave oven , 0.2 g 1,1,1-13C-triolein ( Cambridge Isotope Laboratories , Andover , MA ) thoroughly mixed meal . Concurrent ingestion meal , subject randomly assign drink either 500 ml warm active tea preparation contain 10 g sucrose 500 ml placebo preparation also contain 10 g sucrose . Breath sample collect hourly interval eight hour . At end test period , subject ask rate variety symptom include nausea , bloating , abdominal discomfort , rectal gas ( well obfuscate symptom ) previously describe linear scale range zero ( none ) 4 ( severe ) . In addition , number loose bowel movement note . One week later test repeat subject receive opposite preparation use initial study . The study approve Human Studies Subcommittee Mpls . VA Medical center inform consent obtain subject .</detailed_description>
