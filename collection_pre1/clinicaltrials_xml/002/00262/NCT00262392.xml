	<brief_title>Study Pamidronate Prevention Heterotopic Ossification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The acquired form heterotopic ossification ( HO ) common type extraskeletal ossification usually precipitate trauma total hip arthroplasty [ THA ] spinal cord injury . After THA incidence HO high 50 % , may reach 90 % high risk population lead severe functional impairment ankylotic loss joint mobility . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) external radiation use prevent HO . Specifically , patient surgical resection HO hip high postoperative relapsing rate . Best result observe prophylactic radiation treatment disease recurrence 33-45 % patient . Data effect bisphosphonates prevention postoperative HO scarce mainly limit use first generation bisphosphonate etidronate . In retrospective observational study observe marked beneficial effect pamidronate infusion : none high risk patient establish HO undergo surgical removal present disease recurrence . AIM : We therefore aim prospectively confirm finding evaluate efficacy pamidronate prevention recurrent HO surgical removal ipsilateral HO . Clinical , biochemical radiological treatment outcome compare standard clinical practice use preoperative external radiation . ENDPOINTS : Primary endpoint radiological HO recurrence rate . Secondary endpoint clinical , functional biochemical outcome ( assessed several clinical laboratory marker ) . METHODS : This prospective , randomized trial carry University Hospital Basel/Buderholz collaboration Orthopedic Clinic Swiss Paraplegic Centre Nottwil . Patients admit one participate orthopedic clinic removal HO hip include study . A total number 40 consecutive patient recruit ( recruitment phase 24 month ) randomize `` bisphosphonate group '' , treat peri- postoperative pamidronate infusion ( 1.0 mg/kg/day 3 day ) `` radiation group '' , treat external radiation single dose 7 Gy within 24 hour prior surgical intervention . Additionally , group treat NSAIDs 14 day . EXPECTED RESULTS : We hypothesize treat patient risk , therapy pamidronate superior reduce recurrence rate establish HO compare external radiation surgical resection . SIGNIFICANCE : Because high prevalence select risk patient significant morbidity HO , study offer potential improving management HO . Our study target patient high risk develop HO highly effective prevention still lack . Furthermore , diagnostic marker identify patient risk develop HO would optimize disease management would allow early , successful treatment .</detailed_description>
