	<brief_summary>Sodium pyruvate sodium chloride solution deliver nebulization lung . It believe administration produce bronchodilation asthmatic determine improvement FEV1 . FEV1 measure lung function , determine administration sodium pyruvate . The study blind , subject may receive either sodium pyruvate sodium chloride placebo . The primary endpoint improvement FEV1 15 minute subject receive sodium pyruvate compare FEV1 subject receive sodium chloride placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Use Sodium Pyruvate Bronchodilation Asthmatics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sodium Pyruvate , intermediate metabolite , investigate therapeutic agent reduce reactive oxygen specie lung . Evaluation FEV1 safety parameter sequela reactive oxygen specie reduction identify inhaled Sodium Pyruvate potential bronchodilator . A number lung diseases typically characterize mark inflammation site lung injury . This inflammatory process lead destruction surround healthy lung tissue , continuation expansion sit inflammation . This inflammatory process result production reactive oxygen specie , include superoxide anion hydrogen peroxide , site inflammation . Nitric oxide know bronchodilator , well vasodilator . It use successfully used treat patient various pulmonary disorder . 1 When endogenous nitric oxide expose oxygen radical , however , convert toxic oxidant nitrogen dioxide , bronchodilating effect mitigate . Conversely , nitrogen dioxide know deep lung irritant . Its adverse consequence include follow : pulmonary inflammation ; reduce level lung antioxidants 2 ; impairment respiratory defense mechanism lead increased susceptibility respiratory pathogens 3 increase incidence severity respiratory infection ; reduce lung function , increase asthma COPD symptom . Reactive oxygen specie , especially superoxide anion , know compromise lung function increase bronchoconstriction . As result increase inflammation production reactive oxygen specie , decrease nitric oxide believe occur interstitial lung disease , healthy tissue damage lung function compromise . Based present understanding disease process involve lung disease , appear intervention inflammatory process would result reduction reactive oxygen specie subsequent increase nitric oxide could effective way intervene disease process . This intervention would prevent spread inflammation lung damage cause production reactive oxygen specie , superoxide anion hydrogen peroxide , increase lung function increase bronchodilation . Sodium pyruvate reactive oxygen specie antagonist show neutralize oxygen radical , specifically lower overproduction superoxide anion , regulate production level inflammatory mediator , increase synthesis nitric oxide . 4 Sodium pyruvate also increase cellular level glutathione , major cellular antioxidant , reduce dramatically antigen-induced lung disease patient . 5 In pilot study mild asthmatic subject , demonstrate inhalation low dos ( 0.5 mM ) nebulized sodium pyruvate decrease expired hydrogen peroxide 30 % four hour compare inhalation nebulized saline control . These subject also experience increased pulmonary function determine FEV1 ( +12.8 % ) PEF ( +34.5 % ) measurements four hour ( reference Cellular Sciences IND # 50,089 ) . It theorize reactive oxygen specie antagonist property sodium pyruvate reduce production oxygen radical , include hydrogen peroxide , increased level nitric oxide . Together , lead reduce inflammation lung damage , increase lung function improve bronchodilation . In summary , believe inhalation sodium pyruvate reduce lung damage result increase reactive oxygen specie associate inflammation component disease , enhance availability nitric oxide produce bronchodilation enhance synthesis protect destruction reactive oxygen specie . Experimental Clinical Protocol Hypothesis : Sodium Pyruvate deliver nebulization lung produce bronchodilation asthmatic measure FEV1 Intent : Provide support drug development nebulized Sodium Pyruvate therapeutic agent asthma Design Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over study 52 complete subject Treatment 1 : 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate 0.9 % saline solution , ( 5ml ) ( Cellular Sciences , CA ) nebulized via Pari LC Plus ( R ) reusable nebulizer power ProNeb ( R ) compressor ( Midlothian , VA ) Treatment 2 : Saline 0.9 % , ( 5ml ) ( Baxter ) nebulized use nebulizer system A randomization algorithm use random permute block ( 4-8 subject ) use generate treatment order assignment . An unblinded statistician generate list treatment order assignment . Patient Recruitment Selection The large cohort potential subject previously participate asthma study clinical research laboratory apprise study . Patients attend UCLA Asthma Cough Center also inform study . Advertisements send regular mail e-mail physician participate UCLA Healthcare System local pulmonologists practice throughout Los Angeles area . Local Allergists collaborate u common clinical trial protocol inform study personalized letter e-mail . Advertisements place classified and/or health section local newspaper . A description study post internet site feature clinical research trial . Subjects recruit total 52 complete study . Assuming 5 % drop-out non-compliance rate , expect total 55 subject recruit Patient Eligibility Criteria</detailed_description>
