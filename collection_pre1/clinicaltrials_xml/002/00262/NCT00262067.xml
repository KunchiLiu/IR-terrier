	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Efficacy Safety Bevacizumab Combination With Chemotherapy Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer ( RIBBON 1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study include blind treatment phase , optional open-label post-progression phase , survival follow-up phase . During blinded treatment phase , patient receive chemotherapy study drug ( bevacizumab placebo ) every 3 week disease progression , treatment-limiting toxicity , death due cause . The optional open-label post-progression phase consist chemotherapy treatment ( per investigator discretion ) optional treatment open-label bevacizumab . Patients complete study discontinue treatment ( regardless participation optional open-label post-progression phase ) follow survival subsequent anti-cancer therapy every 4 month death , withdrawal consent , loss follow-up , study termination . Patients discontinue treatment blind treatment phase reason disease progression tumor assessment every 9 week document disease progression death .</detailed_description>
