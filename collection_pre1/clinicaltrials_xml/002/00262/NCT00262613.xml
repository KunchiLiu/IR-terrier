	<brief_summary>In animal model , sodium pyruvate show effective anti-inflammatory agent , human study sodium pyruvate show bronchodilating agent . Subjects COPD know inflammation lung , often bronchoconstriction . As , subject typically multiple therapy , include steroid therapy .

	<brief_title>Sodium Pyruvate Therapy COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) disease , involve conduct airway respiratory tract affect 5-10 % individual United States . The morbidity mortality associate disease increase United States worldwide ( 1 ) . The mechanism involve pathogenesis COPD complex classify inflammatory disease airway characterize increase inflammatory cell ( neutrophil , macrophage , lymphocyte ) bronchial mucosa bronchoalvaeolar lavage fluid ( 2 ) . Some many therapeutic approach manage disease include various inhaled compound , , bronchodilator ( i.e . beta agonist ) inhale systemic steroid treatment . The current therapy without adverse side effect . The purpose study test safety therapeutic value endogenous compound , sodium pyruvate , anti-inflammatory property ( anti-oxidant ) patient COPD . Reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , superoxide anion , free hydroxyl radical , hydrogen peroxide , show toxic various mammalian tissue ( 3 ) , include lung ( 4 -- 6 ) , implicate many human disease ( 7 ) . Anti- oxidant therapy show effective several animal model inflammatory lung disease ( 8-10 ) . Sodium pyruvate part body â€™ natural endogenous anti-oxidant defense system . It secrete cell , readily enters cell , react peroxide `` detoxify ( 11-13 ) . Since hydrogen peroxide also precursor ROS , inhibition broad anti-oxidant effect . Sodium pyruvate show protective anti-oxidant activity vitro ( 11 , 14-17 ) vivo ( 18 , 19 ) . Clinically , sodium pyruvate give patient variety disorder range Friedreich 's ataxia ( 20 ) open heart operation ( 21 ) . It administer via several route include intravenous ( 20-23 ) , topical administration hyperkeratotic disorder ( 24 ) , dietary supplementation ( 25-29 ) . Animal model study rat rabbit conduct assess potential adverse effect . Rats use assess impact sodium pyruvate administer directly lung intratracheal injection ( Rat Study ) . Rabbits use assess impact sodium pyruvate administer inhaled mist use nebulizer ( Pyruvate Inhalation Study Rabbits ) . There adverse effect note parameter , monitor acute lung injury ( histology , bronchoalveolar lavage fluid content , arterial blood gas analysis ) . In addition , show intratrachcheal administration sodium pyruvate beneficial diminishing development acute lung injury rat induce bleomycin . The generation toxic oxygen radical believe major mechanism bleomycin lung toxicity . There two major group COPD medication : 1 ) Bronchodilator agent inhibit bronchoconstriction characteristic patient COPD ; 2 ) anti-inflammatory agent inhibit inflammatory component responsible airway narrow increase mucus production , also characteristic feature patient COPD . The known anti-oxidant property sodium pyruvate make attractive compound possible therapeutic efficacy , vivo anti-inflammatory effect . In addition possible anti-inflammatory property , previously observe ( Phase I study compound , see Phase I report ) acute therapeutic efficacy patient mild bronchial asthma . The observed improvement FEV1 30 minute 2 hour post inhalation sodium pyruvate suggest bronchodilator effect patient . The mechanism action unclear time may result ability inhaled sodium pyruvate modulate reactive oxygen nitrogen specie H2O2 nitric oxide ( NO ) . These specie show elevated expire breath patient COPD asthma thus implicate pathogenesis ( 30-39 ) . Nitric oxide show play important role maintain normal physiologic homeostasis normal injured lung ( 40-42 ) . It show reverse acetylcholine histamine induce bronchoconstriction maintain normal vascular integrity ( 40-42 ) . It possible inhaled sodium pyruvate alters airway level oxygen nitrogen reactive specie result beneficial effect . Since sodium pyruvate endogenous , use previously patient , adverse affect animal model study , adverse effect acute Phase I Clinical Trial patient mild bronchial asthma , feel able use safely long term multiple use study patient COPD . For safety consideration low concentration sodium pyruvate ( 0.5mM ) study previously single dose Safety Trial study 3-times/day double blind placebo control 6 week study . The total daily dose per subject similar 1.5mM concentration ( 3 dos 0.5mM ) . In addition , approximately 3 time less total daily dose give subject receive 5.0mM concentration Single Dose Phase I Safety Trial . The propose study design address long term multiple dose safety aspect inhale sodium pyruvate well acute long-term efficacy compound . The acute study design evaluate possible bronchodilator effect long term multiple use study design evaluate anti-inflammatory property sodium pyruvate .</detailed_description>
