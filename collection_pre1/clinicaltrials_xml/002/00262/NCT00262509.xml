	<brief_title>Emergency Egress Information System Persons With Vision Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose propose three-year research project develop evaluate emergency egress system person visual impairment . This system would use exist lighted exit signage provide egress information distance 100 foot . The distance require visibility distance light exit sign sight person . By offer egress information equivalent distance , investigator hypothesize people visual impairment approach egress performance sight person . The information transmit equivalent sight person obtains , namely , direction exit door . In addition , description exit route provide include distance exit door ; light condition , hazard obstacle encounter exit route ; distance street ; street get building . A receiver worn person include tiny optical array sense direction exit sign . The receiver also translate transmit signal spoken message . A low-profile stereo bone conduction headset indicate direction exit sign along path exit door . For people hear loss , low-profile headset use simulate light `` tap '' one side head indicate direction . Such directional `` tapping '' output may also prove effective loud alarm blare . The objective : 1. develop Talking Exit Lights range least 100 foot , 2. write software user device accurately indicate direction Talking Exit Lights provide spoken message , 3. optimize user interface make easy intuitive use , 4. test accuracy reliability develop system term transmission range directional accuracy , 5. conduct subject evaluation new system . Two version transmit exit sign develop : 1. retro-fit design exist fluorescent light exit sign , 2. Light Emitting Diode ( LED ) design LED exit sign go newly construct building . For retro-fit version , Talking Lights , LLC , modify physical shape size Talking Light digital ballast , make fully compatible replacement exist exit sign ballast . VA investigator develop LED version , design construct microprocessor-controlled system store transmit information use LEDs . Both design use secure power line communication upload transmittal information specific exit sign , ID number . Finally , VA investigator write software exist Talking Lights PocketPC receiver interpret sensor signal , obtain sign location data , convert data stereo sound presentation exit sign direction . This development accomplish via Cooperative Research Development Agreement ( CRADA ) Talking Lights LLC , hold patent electronic ballast convert standard fluorescent bulb digital information transmitter . The company also provide PocketPC receiver decodes proprietary transmission signal , 5-sensor optical array capable pick signal 150-degree field . As part CRADA , Talking Lights modify ballast match form-factor ballast exit sign . Further , release proprietary encoder design VA investigator LED Exit Light design make fully compatible fluorescent light design . Once developed optimize , investigator hypothesize dramatic improvement egress performance age two population : 1. people severe vision loss use white cane dog mobility , 2. people low vision use white cane dog mobility , yet problem read locate exit sign . Results publish presented review National Fire Prevention Agency ( NFPA ) consideration part Life Safety Code , Building Officials Code Administrators ( BOCA ) consideration part National Building Code . COMPARISONS : Egress use exist emergency exit signage .</detailed_description>
