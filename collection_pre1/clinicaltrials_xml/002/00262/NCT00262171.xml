	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish HNPCC related information Taiwan , characterize relevant susceptibility gene relate colorectal cancer provide good disease control high-risk people . To accomplish objective , collect detailed information HNPCC patient family collaborative hospital relate information risk CRC order provide sound disease control system Taiwan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HNPCC autosomal dominant disease clinically characterize development colorectal cancer ( CRC ) early age ( mean age 44 year old ) . Four gene know related hereditary disease . It show excess synchronous metachronous tumor well preponderance right-sided tumor ( 70 % ) . Another feature see among family HNPCC patient occurrence adenocarcinoma site ( particularly endometrial , ovary , stomach , pancreas , ureter , renal pelvis , skin ) . Difficulties arise distinguish environmental factor genetic predisposition familial clustering CRC . The discovery HNPCC germline mutation momentous enables clear distinction carrier noncarriers previously assign 50 % risk germline mutation . The informed consent provide patient important process familial study search germline mutation , provide information education counseling . HNPCC report responsible 1 % 13 % CRC . The frequency HNPCC vary geographical area . The true incidence HNPCC Taiwan area unclear . From year 1995 2000 , 50 4500 ( 1.1 % ) patient HNPCC accord Amsterdam I criteria . MMR gene databases crucial understand relationship genotype phenotype . Kindred share mutation live different place provide information ass contribution environmental factor colorectal carcinogenesis . The related clinical basic research thus important understanding mutation spectrum MMR gene , interaction oncogene , tumor suppressor gene , role genetic polymorphism modify MMR gene Taiwan .</detailed_description>
