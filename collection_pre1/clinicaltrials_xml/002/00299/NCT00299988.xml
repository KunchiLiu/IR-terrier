	<brief_summary>The overall goal double-blind Phase II study evaluate safety , efficacy biological mechanism action Intravenous Immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) treatment mild moderate stage Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . IVIg contain antibody amyloid beta protein central component AD senile plaque . It hypothesize IVIg treatment reduce level beta amyloid brain improve cognitive ability relative placebo . A total 24 patient mild moderate AD capable give informed consent randomly assign receive either IVIg ( 16 patient ) saline placebo ( 8 patient ) six month . This study include comparison four dose regimen IVIg . Cognitive , behavioral functional measure collect baseline , three month six month treatment . Plasma sample collect infusion . Subjects undergo lumbar puncture six month treatment cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarker analysis . In addition , Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image substudies perform two time point study . Following initial 6 month placebo-controlled period , participant opportunity receive IVIg additional 12 month period extension study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Intravenous Immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abnormal process beta-amyloid protein think early causative event pathogenesis Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Immunotherapy target beta amyloid ( Aβ ) demonstrate remarkable capacity arrest even reverse element AD brain pathology . Intravenous Immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) medication obtain pooled plasma healthy human blood donor contain natural anti-amyloid antibody exhibit potent central nervous system anti-inflammatory property . IVIg FDA-approved use 25 year patient variety immune deficiency autoimmune disease establish safety record , FDA-approved treatment AD . A total 24 patient , male females 50 year age old , mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) enrol research study . To eligible , patient must meet National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke/Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ( NINCDS-ADRDA ) criterion probable AD . After write informed consent obtain , subject go screen process determine meet inclusion criterion . Screening procedure include medical history , blood urine test , neurologic exam , chest x-ray MRI . Women want take part study must either post-menopausal , surgically sterilize agree avoid become pregnant entire period participation study . To eligible research study , patient must take stable dose approve AD medication least 3 month prior enter study unable take medication . The design protocol add-on study recommend patient continue take FDA-approved AD medication take study entry . Subjects ' participation study last approximately 19 month , include screen baseline procedure , treatment study drug follow-up visit 1 ½ month finish treatment , plus visit blood test 6 month last infusion study . This research study require patient another person , ( spouse , child , relative , close friend , aide professional caregiver ) , accompany patient clinic visit . Subjects randomized treatment group 6 month infusion IVIg placebo . The treatment group compare different dos frequency treatment . Patients 33 % chance receive placebo . Blood obtain subject every two week examine research laboratory obtain information IVIg 's biological effect . Cerebrospinal fluid obtain lumbar puncture twice course study purpose . Patients ask allow portion blood sample use Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) test bank genetic research test related AD aging , participate test allow blood sample store order take part study . Cognitive test carried baseline every three month period 18 month . Results cognitive test constitute primary endpoint study . Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image substudies perform two time point study . Safety laboratories assessment carry regular interval . Subjects responsible research study-related cost responsible cost evaluation require establish diagnosis .</detailed_description>
