	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary objective study assess effect 4 week theophylline therapy exercise performance lung function patient COPD already receive combination inhale long-acting bronchodilator therapy . Background : The late Canadian COPD guideline recommend use long-acting bronchodilator patient continue experience symptom despite as-needed use short-acting bronchodilator . Unfortunately , patient severe COPD may continue experience symptom despite use long-acting beta-agonists anticholinergic . For patient , Canadian guideline recommend trial theophylline . Studies show theophylline reduce symptom improve exercise performance , however , use theophylline limit narrow therapeutic window multiple drug interaction . Despite recommendation , remain unknown whether theophylline provide additional benefit COPD patient already receive combine long-acting bronchodilator therapy . No study evaluate effect theophylline patient already receive long-acting beta-agonist long-acting anticholinergic therapy . Methods : This prospective randomize double-blinded parallel group clinical trial evaluate short-term effect theophylline therapy exercise duration lung function patient already receive tiotropium long-acting beta-agonist ( salmeterol formoterol ) . Twenty-four patient moderate severe COPD already use tiotropium long-acting beta agonist randomize receive either : ) 4 week oral theophylline dose achieve therapeutic blood level , b ) 4 week identical placebo therapy . Only patient stable COPD ( exacerbation change medication last 2 month ) contraindication exercise test theophylline use enrol . All patient undergo baseline pulmonary function test incremental constant load exercise test prior randomization . PFTs constant load exercise test repeat 4 week therapy . Patients instructed report adverse event theophylline dose adjust ensure therapeutic blood level ( 55-110 umol/L ) , prior repeat test . Outcome Measurements : The primary outcome interest effect theophylline exercise duration constant load ( 75 % maximum ) exercise test . The study power detect 20 % great improvement exercise duration theophylline-treated group . Secondary outcome measure include change spirometry ( FEV1 ) lung volume . Anticipated result : Exercise duration ( constant load exercise test ) choose primary endpoint study show reproducible highly responsive measure physiologic benefit COPD . It unknown whether theophylline provide additional increase exercise duration , add combined long-acting bronchodilator regimen . If improvement find theophylline , follow-up study large size long duration require investigate whether benefit translate improvement clinical outcome quality life frequency exacerbation . Alternatively , improvement detect , current COPD treatment recommendation re-evaluated .</detailed_description>

Lung disease COPD ( e.g : asthma , interstitial lung disease ) Nonpulmonary comorbidity may potentially limit exercise capacity ( e.g : cardiac disease , arthritis ) exacerbate theophylline use . History adverse response theophylline condition may increase likelihood adverse reaction theophylline ( cardiac disease , liver disease , renal impairment , thyroid disease ) Use theophylline last two month . Use medication may potentially interact theophylline ( e.g . warfarin , digoxin ) Patients currently enrol ( schedule enrol ) pulmonary rehabilitation program accept completion program ( may potentially affect exercise performance ) .
