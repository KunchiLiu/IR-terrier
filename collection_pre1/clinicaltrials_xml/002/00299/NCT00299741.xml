	<brief_title>Study SU11248 Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : There nearly 30,000 death per year United States prostate cancer , make large important target patient population new therapeutic . The mainstay therapy advance prostate cancer androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . Although ADT effective large majority men advance prostate cancer , favorable response ADT transient . In hormone-refractory , metastatic prostate cancer effective systemic treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy . The median duration response standard , taxane-based chemotherapy approximately six month , median survival contemporary study 16-18 month . Thus , urgent need new therapeutic agent treat advanced prostate cancer . SU011248 orally administer inhibitor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) receptor , FLT-3 c-KIT . SU011248 demonstrate significant clinical activity malignancy , activity prostate cancer study date . Clinical trial demonstrate SU011248 generally well tolerate , mild fatigue diarrhea common adverse effect . Preclinical study demonstrate level VEGF PDGF elevate prostate cancer may correlate bad outcome . The inhibition several pathway implicate prostate cancer progression SU011248 suggest might significant anti-tumor activity men AIPC . Many new , targeted agent efficacious subset patient particular malignancy , subset may definable basis specific tumor mutation pattern gene expression . Identification reliable predictive method crucial move forward target therapy , believe exploratory clinical trial one incorporate assay design address issue . Objective/Hypothesis : The objective proposal determine whether SU011248 effective treatment two cohort men advance prostate cancer : men androgen-independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) treat chemotherapy ( Group A ) , men taxane-refractory , metastatic disease ( Group B ) . We hypothesize specific serum biomarkers tumor mutation may predict response may allow optimal subject selection future . Specific Aims : ( 1 ) To evaluate efficacy safety SU011248 men chemo-naïve AIPC , ( 2 ) evaluate efficacy safety SU011248 men metastatic , taxane-resistant AIPC , ( 3 ) measure serum biomarkers men AIPC prior follow treatment SU011248 correlate marker clinical response , ( 4 ) mutational analysis tumor specimens men metastatic prostate cancer treat SU011248 correlate clinical response . Study Design : We conduct phase II clinical trial two group subject : men AIPC yet develop overt metastasis ( Group A ) , men taxane-refractory , metastatic disease ( Group B ) . Men group receive single-agent SU011248 six-week repeating schedule , four week daily treatment follow two-week rest . The primary endpoint PSA response rate . Secondary endpoint include time disease progression , objective response rate , safety parameter . Eligibility study require sign informed consent , adenocarcinoma prostate , document PSA progression despite ADT , reasonable functional status , resolution toxic effect prior treatment , acceptable bone marrow , hepatic , renal cardiac function . A Simon 's two-stage design employ allow early termination lack efficacy . Ultimately , 30 patient enrol group , total 60 patient . A defined program history physical examination , radiographic study , laboratory test include PSA carry determine efficacy safety SU011248 patient population . All subject blood urine collect research purpose , men Group B tumor biopsy prior enrollment . Translational study aim identify specific biomarkers blood include analysis serum cytokine level include VEGF others , circulate endothelial cell endothelial precursor , white blood cell differential , bone turnover marker . Tumor sample analyze presence predictive tumor mutation . Relevance : Our ultimate goal determine whether SU011248 important therapeutic agent men advance prostate cancer , identify predictive marker anti-cancer activity within individual subject would allow selective treatment appropriate subject future . The data obtain also contribute general understanding serum biomarkers genetic change advance prostate cancer . Positive result trial would lead expanded , multi-center trial SU011248 men advance prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
