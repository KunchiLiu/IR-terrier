	<brief_summary>We test - chronically ill manage long term care population - effectiveness intervention provide nurse Care Managers inventory evidence-based practice tailor patient different level knowledge , skill confidence engage self-care management . Specifically , develop `` change package '' evidence-based hypertension ( HTN ) management strategy gear patient score four different stage activation Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) . We randomly assign group interdisciplinary team manage long-term care plan intervention control status train Care Managers Intervention team use change package conjunction patient 's PAM score design - involvement patient - individualize HTN management plan . We assess impact intervention patient activation outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Patient Activation Measure Chronic Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The three main aim project : 1 . Determine whether PAM-driven intervention increase patient ' knowledge self-management skill , measure generic PAM score HTN-specific measure develop research team . 2 . Determine whether PAM-driven intervention improve HTN patient ' systolic diastolic blood pressure ( BP ) , measure three way : - Average percent reduction systolic diastolic BP . - Percent patient achieve BP control ( define &lt; 140 systolic &lt; 90 diastolic BP &lt; 130 systolic &lt; 80 diastolic patient diabetes renal disease ) . - Percent patient control HTN maintain control . 3 . Conduct analysis examine implementation intervention trainer Care Managers Intervention group understand barrier facilitator affect implementation process . In addition , conduct feasibility study subset Care Managers determine Visual Scan Assessment Patient Activation might incorporate routine assessment care planning procedure . Therefore , fourth aim project : 4 . Assess feasibility perceive usefulness Visual Scan Assessment tool increase feedback Care Managers well support patient self-care management .</detailed_description>
