	<brief_title>Modification Doses Efavirenz According Its Blood Concentration HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , efavirenz dose systematically , without take account individual characteristic individual patient . However , plasma concentration efavirenz may widely vary different subject receive dose drug ( interindividual variability ) . Therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) signifies individualise pharmacological dosing , base plasma level patient present . This strategy broadly use field treatment medical condition acquire grow interest field antiretroviral treatment . Thus , use TDM treatment na√Øve patient nelfinavir indinavir translated increase proportion individual suppress viral load also reduction HAART-induced adverse event . However , data utility therapeutic monitoring level efavirenz HIV-infected patient scant . On basis , might think modification dos efavirenz , guide plasma concentration , patient receive drug whose plasma level efavirenz outside therapeutic range , might improve tolerability treatment without compromise virological efficacy .</detailed_description>
