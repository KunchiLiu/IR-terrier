	<brief_summary>The Tibia bone ( shinbone ) locate leg , itis frequently fracture bone body poor blood supply surround skin fat instead muscle like thighbone cause heal problem . Problems frequently find heal process malunion ( bone heals wrong place ) , nonunion ( bone never heals ) , compartment syndrome ( big inflammation muscle cause compression nerve blood vessel ) necrosis ( death ) tissue . Surgeons try decrease problem use different surgical technique substance accelerate heal . Substances frequently use fracture bone graft . Bone graft normally obtain wrist hip bone , sometimes cause complication vary pain infection . To avoid complication , investigator use alternative obtain bone donor . The donor bone graft carefully analyze cleaned ensure cause problem receiver . Bone obtain donor call Demineralized Bone Matrix ( DBM ) . DBM prove effective help fracture heal faster want use patient tibia fracture . This study important DBM improve way tibia fracture treat could potential decrease time patient must stay hospital . DBM could improve heal time diminish overall cost . Also , use DBM plus reamings , patient fewer complication like pain infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Duration This study last 24 month . Subject Recruitment Inclusion criterion : - Patients present diaphyseal tibia fracture . - Patients older 18 year old - Patients undergo IM nail definitive treatment . Exclusion criterion : - Patients systemic bone infection . - Patients renal disease kind . Location Emory Orthopedic Service Grady Hospital Background The tibia common fracture bone . 14 It also bone high incidence open wound tibia proximity skin . 14 This bone often high risk malunion , nonunion , infection , complication tibia 's precarious blood supply , also associate compartment syndrome 1 9 % case . 10,14 Even though relatively new surgical procedure intramedullary nailing increase function recovery patient , still much do assure proper evolution patient tibia fracture . 10 It important find adjuvant help recovery . It postulate use bone graft could help process analyzed drawn definitively conclusion . Tibia fracture often part injury polytrauma patient . Complicated fracture produce trauma often need bone graft . Bone graft usually obtain hip distal radius procedure exempt complication pain , infection increase hospitalization stay . In order avoid event , bone graft substitute develop expensive . 11 An example bone morphogenic protein ( BMPs ) . BMPs show high efficacy rate cost wise , could prohibitive . 11 DBM could reasonable alternative tentatively could efficacy less antigenic risk 5,9,11 . Previous well design study demonstrate efficacy demineralize bone matrix fracture heal non-unions , total joint osteolytic lesion , benign bone cyst spine fusions.3-9,11-13 It even prove potential efficacy restore cartilage surface 7 . The importance finding support idea use DBMs application could beneficiate trauma patient . DBMs manufacture different company available different presentation . Most important , vary also efficacy . The efficacy DBM depend mainly osteoconductivity osteoinductivity 1,5 . The difference osteoconductivity osteoinductivity available DBMs could represent factor limit host 's response graft 12 . According Louis-Ugbo et al , even different presentation DBM 's could cause different host response . 11 This important find DBM highly effective , also adequate presentation use trauma fracture patient require acute treatment . In study do Cammisa et al asseverate value Grafton® base upon high osteoconductivity osteoinductivity product present , also fact gel formulation allow mixture allograft help reach difficult graft sit 3 . Other study show putty presentation Grafton® could even higher inductive property 3 . A previously do study Grady Hospital conduct service report enhanced fracture heal high energy tibial fracture treat percutaneous injection bone marrow Grafton® acutely ( reference insert ) . Our experience support hypothesis Grafton® could also valuable treatment close tibia diaphyseal fracture , small healing frame , decrease hospitalization time early return work . Research Design This study would randomize consecutive patient present close tibia fracture two group : - Group 1 : Intramedullary ( IM ) rodding standard fashion reamings . - Group 2 : IM rodding intramedullary grafting ream mixed Grafton® . We randomize patient use list contain patient research number research group . The research number assign order presentation . During operative procedure , patient undergo surgery usual . In particular surgery , surgeon need follow follow step : 1 . An incision make along medial border patella tendon . This incision use inset nail intramedullary canal.10 2 . The surgeon insert awl bone metaphysis access medullary canal.10 3 . A ball-tipped guide wire insert tibial canal , pass across fracture site.10 4 . The canal ream 0.5 mm increment . 10 The entry site ream wide enough receive nail . 5 . After ream , ball-tipped guide replace permanent nail . 6 . Proximal distal screw place avoid nail displacement 7 . Incision wound closed patient place splint . The Grafton® mixture prepare mix exceed bone produce ream Putty Grafton® form . This preparation add surgery , permanent nail situate . The mixture place canal positioned fracture site ball-tipped guide . Fluoroscopy image take assure proper localization mixture . After step , permanent nail place . Both group would undergo standard X-rays appropriate time . Callus formation would determine standard radiographic ( bridge callus measurement ) clinical evaluation ( decrease pain rest , stand position ambulation ) 4 . There alteration length stay post-operative regimen . There schedule post-op visit ( one month , 6 week 8 week ) X-rays tibia take ( AP , lateral oblique ) . Visits We follow patient schedule post-op visitis . They schedule follow : Post op visit 1 : 1 month surgery Post op visit 2 : 6 week surgery Post op visit 3 : 12 week surgery Post op visit 4 : 16 week surgery Post op visit 5 : 20 week surgery . If necessary , include visit 6 7 1 year earlier accord patient 's need . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis achieve use Fisher 's exact test 4 . A P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant 4 . For pilot study enroll 30 patient , 15 per group , plan extend number 50 patient future , multicenter , randomize study . Using two-sample t-test , follow analysis perform assume normal distribution 2 sample equal variance . If mean time fracture heal group 1 42 day compare 35 day group 2 , common standard deviation 14 day group , sample size 50 patient yield significance level .5 power .80 . Potential Risks Grafton® associate acute tubular necrosis animal study do athymic rat 2,9 . This study 's author suggest restrain use DBM child patient renal disease 2,9 . These finding corroborate study moment point analyze associated material use Grafton® . In case , include patient type renal disease patient age 18 year old present study .</detailed_description>
