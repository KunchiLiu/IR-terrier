	<brief_title>Oral Clofarabine Study Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clofarabine new chemotherapy drug design interfere growth development cancer cell . If find eligible , randomly assign ( roll dice ) one 2 treatment group . Participants Group 1 take low dose clofarabine Participants Group 2 . You equal chance assign either 2 treatment group . Neither study doctor choose assignment . Later ( first 40 patient ) , assignment favor well treatment arm one arm select significantly well one , 80 patient treated total . When assigned treatment group , receive clofarabine tablet day 5 day row . This repeated every 4-8 week . Each 4-8 week period consider 1 cycle treatment . Original patient still study ( original patient receive still receive 30 mg/m2 ) already reduce low dos subsequent course treatment discontinued/completed . These patient ask sign new inform consent document make aware new development study . Each dose clofarabine take 4 ounce water morning , empty stomach . You must eat drink anything besides water midnight night take study drug 1 hour take morning dose . You take clofarabine every morning time . If vomiting occurs within 15 minute take clofarabine , dose may repeat . If vomiting occur 15 minute take clofarabine , dose replace make . Coffee caffeinated liquid take dose 1 hour dosing . All clofarabine dose take either outpatient inpatient set qualify trained site personnel give appropriate instruction and/or care provider take home . At start cycle , receive enough clofarabine 1 cycle therapy . You store clofarabine original container room temperature . You keep container close use , reach child . After cycle therapy , receive next cycle chemotherapy blood count recover possible side effect go away ( around 4 8 week ) . You must stay Houston first treatment cycle ( 4 8 week ) require return Houston receive additional cycle chemotherapy ( 6 day cycle ) . Before every treatment cycle , doctor perform physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . You ask level daily activity feel . You blood sample ( 1-2 teaspoon ) collect routine lab test 1-2 time week first cycle , every 2-4 week therapy . Repeat bone marrow sample collect every 1-3 cycle . However , complete study third cycle , bone marrow may take . You may choose check-up visit blood test local doctor . If show response experience severe side effect , receive total 12 cycle therapy . During cycle , clofarabine give way first cycle . However , dose clofarabine may lower late cycle decrease risk side effect may occur previous cycle . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . This investigational study . Clofarabine give vein approved FDA treatment pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Its use study experimental . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
