	<brief_summary>The purpose study create tissue bank gynecologic cancer normal tissue study cancer order well understand change occur molecular level ( DNA , RNA , protein ) lead development cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Bank Biological Specimens From Patients With Gynecologic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer arises due genetic alteration disrupt numerous cellular function include proliferation , program cell death senescence , ultimately control number cell population . The genetic damage underlies development cancer diverse etiology loss DNA repair mechanism also may play role allow mutation accumulate . Cancers also characterize ability invade surround tissue metastasize . Many molecular alteration involve process yet elucidate . Gynecologic cancer afflict woman age . Cervical cancer common gynecologic malignancy worldwide , account 400,000 case annually . Endometrial cancer common gynecologic malignancy approximately 33,000 new case diagnose annually American woman . Ovarian cancer fourth common cause cancer relate mortality American woman , approximately 14,000 death occur 2000 . The creation tissue repository contain tissue specimen , blood/serum , molecular extract ( DNA , RNA , protein ) provide rich source tissue future gynecological disease research study .</detailed_description>
