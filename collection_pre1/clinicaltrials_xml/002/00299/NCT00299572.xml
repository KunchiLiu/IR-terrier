	<brief_summary>Hyperphosphatemia frequently see patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Hyperphosphatemia usually result high calcium-phosphorus product ( CPP ) may subsequently lead artery become risk factor cardiovascular complication . Alendronate , due effect inhibit osteoclast , approve treatment osteoporosis . Previous report find use bisphosphonates could suppress arterial calcification hemodialysis dialysis patient . The aim study evaluate safety efficacy alendronate suppress coronary artery aortic calcification , well improve bone density chronic peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient . This study include ESRD patient receive maintenance PD 3 month , high CPP level ( ≧55 ) , chest X-ray proven aortic calcification coronary artery calcification . All participant randomly allocate either group 1 group 2 . Group 1 patient receive alendronate 70 mg weekly first 16 week , group 2 patient receive dose drug every week second 16 week . The extent coronary artery aortic calcification evaluate use multi-detector spiral compute tomography , whereas bone mineral density measure dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry . Both examination perform week 0 , 16 32 participant . Laboratory study possible adverse reaction regularly monitor . We expect alendronate alleviate progression arterial calcification even improve . Bone density may also improve treatment . Besides , wish find independent factor ( ) influence efficacy alendronate . These result may help clinical physician early intervention prevention cardiovascular complication ESRD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES The purpose study determine long-term use alendronate suppress coronary artery aortic calcification chronic PD patient . The effect alendronate bone mineral density patient group also evaluate . METHODS 1 . Patients To eligible study , patient meet following criterion : ( 1 ) receive maintenance PD 3 month Far Eastern Memorial Hospital , ( 2 ) high CPP level ( ≧55 ) , ( 3 ) chest X-ray proven aortic calcification coronary artery calcification proven . Patients exclude one follow condition : ( 1 ) hospitalize recent 3 month due severe comorbid disease , ( 2 ) hypersensitive alendronate component , ( 3 ) esophageal disease ( 4 ) able stand sit upright 30 minute , ( 5 ) refractory hypocalcemia , ( 6 ) patient pregnant . Each eligible participant give his/her write informed consent start study . The study approve Institutional Review Board hospital . 2 . Study Design The study prospective , randomize cross-over study . Fifty patient include . All participant randomly allocate either group 1 group 2 . Each group consist 25 patient . Group 1 patient receive alendronate 70 mg weekly since first week till 16th week study , group 2 patient receive dose drug every week since 17th week till 32nd week . Group 1 patient receive alendronate since 17th week till 32nd week , group 2 patient receive alendronate since first week till 16 week . The extent coronary artery aortic calcification evaluate use multi-detector spiral compute tomography , whereas bone mineral density measure dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry . Both examination perform week 0 , 16 32 participant . Serum level calcium keep within normal limit serum level phosphorus keep 6 mg/dl . （3）Administration Alendronate One tablet alendronate ( 70 mg per tablet ) swallow patient every week water least 30 minute breakfast , beverage medication day treatment period . Patients must lie least 30 minute take drug . （4）Measurement Coronary Artery Aortic Calcification Multi-detector spiral computerize tomography ( CT ) chest perform week 0 , 16 32 participant measure extent coronary aortic calcification . （5）Measurement Bone Density Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry perform week 0 , 16 32 participant measure density bone . （6）Demographic Clinical Characteristics Patients Patients characteristic age sex document . Clinical parameter include body height , body weight , duration dialysis , calcium concentration dialysate , medication use record . Blood pressure measure clinical visit 3 time patient sit least 15 minute . （7）Collection Laboratory Data Fasting serum level albumin , phosphorus , calcium , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) hemoglobin level patient check study entry every month . Fasting serum level triglyceride , total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-chol ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-chol ) , hypersensitive C-reactive protein ( CRP ) patient check study entry every 3 month . （8）Record Adverse Effects Alendronate Any adverse effect alendronate record every month clinic visit . （9）Compliance Patients Compliance patient monitor use telephone call every week treatment period alendronate . （10）Statistical Analysis All value express mean ± SD . All data test normal distribution analysis . Differences mean value 2 group test mean analysis variance . Group comparisons categorical variable analyze use chi-square test . Multivariate regression apply identify independent determinant coronary artery aortic calcification . A probability less 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
