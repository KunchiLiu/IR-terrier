	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Comparing N 1 Trials Standard Practice Improve Adherence Statins Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholesterol lower medication call `` statin '' decrease heart disease people diabetes research show many patient take medication , sometimes side effect . In experience , side effect attribute statin therapy often subjective , non-specific , associated objective evidence clinically important problem . The common example muscle cramp despite normal CK level , symptom include fatigue , GI intolerance , neurological symptom . Traditionally , effect treatment determine use randomize controlled trial . N 1 trial minimize bias randomization , double-blinding , multiple crossover , therefore excellent tool evaluate adverse effect therapy symptoms non-specific objective evidence causal relationship ambiguous . Patients intolerant statin routine practice , lack objective evidence significant harm , randomize receive statin either n 1 trial standard practice . Our hypothesis n 1 trial improve statin adherence , thereby improve low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level . Patients n 1 trial group give 1 month course either simvastatin placebo . Patients group receive statin accord standard practice give prescription doctor usual way . At end study , determine patient participate n 1 trial group take statin compare patient conventional group lead low cholesterol level . We plan use result small feasibility study test method plan large study question .</detailed_description>
