	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy Golimumab ( CNTO 148 ) Subjects With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Previously Treated With Biologic Anti-TNFa Agent ( )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Golimumab fully human protein ( antibody ) bind tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFa ) . TNFa increase patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , play major role cause joint pain , swell damage RA . Other market drug target TNFa ( anti-TNFa drug ) show effective reducing symptom , sign joint damage RA , limitation respect safety ease use . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial efficacy safety new anti-TNFa drug , golimumab , 2 dos , inject skin every 4 week subject active RA previously treat least 1 dose biologic anti-TNFa agent ( etanercept , adalimumab infliximab ) . Concomitant therapy methotrexate , sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine permit subject tolerated medication least 12 week prior first administration study drug stable dose least 4 week prior first administration study agent . The study hypothesis golimumab safe effective treatment RA subject active RA previously treat least one biologic anti-TNFa agent measure American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) response criterion , Disease Activity Score 28 ( DAS28 ) responses change baseline Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) , without cause unacceptable significant adverse effect . The ACR response criterion design assess level improvement sign symptom RA . The DAS28 response also measure improvement sign symptom RA use joint examination laboratory test . The HAQ series question measure subject 's impairment physical function cause RA . Patients receive golimumab 50 mg 100 mg placebo injection skin every 4 week Week 24 . After Week 24 , subject receive golimumab 50 mg 100 mg injection , golimumab continue group every 4 week 4 half year .</detailed_description>
