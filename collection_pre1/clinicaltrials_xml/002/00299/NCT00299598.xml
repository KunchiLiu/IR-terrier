	<detailed_description>Composite resin material widely use dental clinic replacement hard tissue . Although mechanical property wear resistance material improve substantially , antibacterial property still limit . These resin-based material accumulate dental plaque restorative material vitro , vivo , may result secondary caries . A number report describe experiment composite resin impregnate antibacterial agent antibiotic , silver ion , iodine quaternary ammonium compound , gradually release . However , release antibacterial agent surround milieu various release rate several disadvantage : decrease mechanical property carrier material time , short-term effectiveness , possible toxicity release properly control . As compare conventional antibacterial agent low molecular weight , advantage polymeric antibacterial agent nonvolatile , chemically stable , chemically bound within polymer carrier via active group improve integration composite , difficult penetrate skin . It report polycations exhibit antibacterial property , i.e . interact disrupt bacterial cell membrane . A number polymer antibacterial property develop purpose , include soluble insoluble pyridinium-type polymer involve surface coating . Several report describe incorporation methacryloyloxydodecylpydidinium bromide ( MDPB ) monomer composite resin show release incorporate monomer still exhibit antibacterial property . The objective study evaluate clinically safety efficacy alkylated polyethylenimine ( PEI ) nanoparticles composite resin restorative material . In vitro study , addition small percent ( 1 % w/w ) nanoparticles affect significantly flexural strength commercial material . The mechanical property new composite close original composite , exert strong antibacterial activity upon contact last least six month . method : alkylated polyethylenimine ( PEI ) nanoparticles add ( 1 % w/w ) hybrid composite resin disk embed palatal removable appliance.The disk would close contact palate order check contact mucosities . disk side face Tongue would evaluate antibacterial potency confocal laser scan microscopy .</detailed_description>
