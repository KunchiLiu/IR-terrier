	<brief_summary>The prevalence asthma continue increase . Despite large number available therapy , many patient continue require emergency deparment ( ED ) visit intensive therapy . However , ED visit continue major contributor healthcare cost asthma treatment . In United States alone , asthma 11th common reason ED visit , ED visit hospitalization account almost 50 % healthcare cost asthma . Additionally , 20 % asthmatic ED visit hospitalization , patient account 80 % direct cost asthma treatment . Current National Asthma Education Prevention Program ( NAEPP ) guideline regard management acute asthma exacerbation ED set include : oxygenation patient , inhaled short-acting β2-agonists systemic corticosteroid . Zileuton , specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor , extensively studied inflammatory disease asthma , involve leukotrienes mediator inflammation . Zileuton Immediate Release ( IR ) tablet ( Zyflo® ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) December 1996 prevention treatment asthma adult child 12 year age old . The result 2 pivotal study asthmatics zileuton IR tablet demonstrate zileuton dose 600 mg QID produce maintain lasting improvement lung function . In addition last effect zileuton , acute bronchodilation ( early 60 minute ) observe administration first 600 mg oral dose . This acute bronchodilator effect may benefit patient acute exacerbation asthma add usual care ED clinic setting . Critical Therapeutics develop injectable formulation zileuton explore use acute asthma exacerbation . This initial study intend provide PK data , information safety tolerability indication pharmacologic activity evidence lung function change . In attempt enhance potential observing effect lung function , patient demonstrate ability respond increase FEV1 least 10 % within 3 hour oral zileuton dosing enrol .</brief_summary>
