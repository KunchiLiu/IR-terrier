	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness safety 3 different dos paliperidone extend release ( ER ) compare placebo patient diagnose Bipolar I Disorder experience acute manic mixed episode .

	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Three Fixed Doses Extended-release Paliperidone Subjects With Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several treatment available treatment acute manic mixed episode associate bipolar disorder . Some treatment although use many year , associate well-known problem poor tolerability , significant toxicity , narrow therapeutic range , drug interaction . Often , several drug must use combination achieve best clinical effect . More recently , group compound know atypical antipsychotic , risperidone , license use indication . Based pharmacological profile Paliperidone , expect effective treatment acute manic mixed episode associate bipolar disorder . Paliperidone extend release show effective schizophrenia improve drug delivery system reduce potential drug interaction . Study drug tablet design deliver appropriate amount drug ( 3 mg 6 mg ) use `` Push-Pull '' delivery system base patented oral osmotic pump technology ( OROS ) allow drug deliver relatively controlled rate 24 hour . This study test 3 different dos paliperidone extend release ( 3 , 6 , 12 mg/day daily ) compare placebo ( inactive substance ) . There 3 part study : screening washout phase last 7 day determine patient eligible study discontinue current medication , double-blind treatment phase last 3 week , follow-up phase last 1 week end-of-study visit early withdrawal study . During double-blind treatment phase , patient randomly assign receive treatment either placebo 1 3 daily dos paliperidone extend release . Patients assign paliperidone extend release receive either 3 , 6 , 12 mg/day give daily 3-week period . All patient whether receive paliperidone extend release placebo take 2 capsule time study drug give . Patients hospitalize least first 7 day double-blind treatment , may discharge seventh day follow outpatient base judgment study doctor . End-of-study/early withdrawal procedure do last dose study drug receive blood sample take , early withdrawal study . Patients follow-up visit safety evaluation approximately 1 week later . The study , include screen washout phase , last approximately 35 day 5 week . Effectiveness primarily determine change total Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) score beginning ( baseline ) end double-blind treatment phase study . The Young Mania Rating Scale 11-item establish measure use evaluate manic symptom . A secondary measure effectiveness change Global Assessment Functioning Scale ( GAF ) baseline end double-blind treatment phase study . Other measure effectiveness include time onset therapeutic effect , responder rate ( define 50 % reduction baseline Young Mania Rating Scale score ) , change baseline end double-blind treatment phase assessment scale . Additional assessment scale use evaluate clinical progress patient , psychotic depressive symptom bipolar disorder , quality sleep daytime drowsiness , health-related function , rate severity patient 's bipolar disorder . Safety evaluate frequency , severity , time side effect , clinical laboratory test ( include pregnancy test ) , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , vital sign measurement , physical neurological examination . The study hypotheses primary secondary effectiveness measure 1 ) least 1 dose paliperidone extend release well placebo change baseline Young Mania Rating Scale total score end 3 week treatment , 2 ) least 1 dose paliperidone extend release well placebo change baseline Global Assessment Functional Scale score end 3 week treatment . The potential effect variation gene relate paliperidone ER may evaluate separately patient consent DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) testing . Paliperidone ER , 3 , 6 , 12 mg/day placebo daily 3 week . To maintain blind , patient take 2 capsule time study drug give . Capsules may contain 3-mg tablet match placebo , 6-mg tablet match placebo , two 6-mg tablet , placebo ( inactive ) tablet . The dos study drug fix throughout study .</detailed_description>
