	<brief_summary>Sepsis 13th common cause death United States , cause approximately 210,000 death per year . Once DIC develop , irreversible organ injury already occur mortality rate 70 % . Inhibition systemic coagulation activate protein C concentrate therapy sepsis introduce past several decade improve outcomes . Elucidation coagulopathic mechanism early development DIC may give rise target therapy strategy early intervention . We hypothesize increase endogenous thrombin potential precedes development overt DIC clinically significant time period . Our primary objective determine endogenous thrombin potential ( ETP ) measure first diagnosis sepsis prior onset DIC organ failure predictive overt DIC and/or poor outcome . We compare ETP standard coagulation assay clinical assessment DIC use ISTH criterion overt DIC . A secondary objective study determine host coagulation variable predispose development DIC poor clinical outcome sepsis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Activation coagulation system occur early patient sepsis , although clinically overt disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) identify minority patient severe sepsis . Uncontrolled activation coagulation system may contribute pathophysiology multiple organ failure subsequent morbidity mortality sepsis . Identification risk factor predict progression severe sepsis DIC elusive . We propose whole blood cell-rich coagulation assay offer improved sensitivity procoagulant anti-coagulant change occur early sepsis improve recognition non-overt DIC . Future study address whether assay sufficiently high predictive value identify subgroup patient could benefit early intervention . Specific Aims : 1 . We hypothesize increased thrombin generation precede development overt DIC clinically significant time period . Our primary objective determine endogenous thrombin potential measure first diagnosis sepsis prior onset DIC organ failure predictive overt DIC . 2 . There significant individual variation among healthy population endogenous thrombin generation due know unknown polymorphism within coagulation protein . We predict host variable thrombin generation contribute susceptibility DIC poor outcome sepsis . A secondary objective study determine host coagulation variable predispose morbidity mortality associate sepsis .

Clinical data collection Clinical data form ( see Appendix B ) complete time enrollment daily 7 day , hospital discharge , 28 day . Clinicians blind result research laboratory test . Laboratory Methods Blood plasma Each patient 15 ml blood collect enrollment . Specimens obtain antecubital venipuncture . Free flow minimal suction employ ; vacuum container avoid . Specimens platelet-poor plasma ( PPP ) whole blood analysis collect siliconized glass tube 0.105M tri-sodium citrate ratio 1 part anticoagulant 9 part whole blood . PPP separate within 60 minute analyze immediately . Platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) specimens separated upper Â¾ volume plasma supernatant centrifugation 265g 10 minute room temperature . The platelet count Beckman Coulter counter adjust 150 X 109 platelets/l autologous PPP . PRP use within 60 minute . Cbc , PT/PTT , Fibrinogen , d-dimer , Protein C activity , Protein S activity , ATIII activity , Factor V Leiden mutation , Prothrombin G20210A mutation analysis perform Memorial Herman Hospital clinical laboratory . RoTEG Whole blood specimen draw describe . Measurements perform two roTEG Coagulation Analyzers Pentapharm . RoTEG all-plastic reaction cup procure manufacturer . Polypropylene polyethylene pipette use handle reagent blood . Citrated whole blood re-calcified 20 mcl 0.2 mol/L CaCl2 activate 20 mcl solution recombinant human TF ( Innovin ) dilute 1:1000 use sodium barbital buffer . The measured parameter define manufacturer follow : The clotting time ( CT ) time second Ca2+ activation coagulation increase elasticity correspond 2 graphical mm obtain ordinate . The clot formation time ( CFT ) time second pass elasticity increase 2 mm 20 mm ordinate . The maximum clot formation ( MCF ) express maximum strength millimeter final clot . Several additional parameter represent continuous registration clot formation define Sorensen et al 28 : maximum velocity ( MaxVel ) clot formation , time maximum velocity ( T , MaxVel ) clot formation , area velocity curve ( AUC ) . Thrombin Generation Calibrated automate thrombin generation measurement perform use Hemker methodology . 29 Platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) prepare describe . Fluorogenic substrate chromogenic thrombin purchase Thermolabsystems , recombinant relipidated tissue factor ( TF ) Dade Behring . alpha 2 macroglobulin-thrombin complex use calibrator purchase Thrombolabsystems .

All statistic perform use NCSS/PASS . Sample size determination : There publish report thrombin generation assay thromboelastography sepsis , DIC . In previous study patient take anticoagulant ( warfarin ) , 400 % decrement ETP ( 1719 404 ) . In order derive mean ETP target width 100 95 % confidence interval , assume standard deviation 259 , need enroll 100 patient . We employ follow statistical method analysis data : Specific Aim # 1 : The endogenous thrombin potential ( ETP ) area curve thrombin generation assay . The value continuous range 0 2,500 . Maximum clot formation ( MCF ) roTEG also use approximate ETP . The DIC score calculate cod dichotomous variable : Yes ( score &gt; 5 ) No ( score &lt; 5 ) . A receiver operate curve derive ETP MCT sensitivity specificity predict DIC . If area curve find significant , optimal cut-off value high degree accuracy chosen . This value use estimate predictive value test . Positive predictive value calculate formula : # patient ETP MCT cut-off development DIC / # patient positive DIC score . The predictive value negative DIC score calculate use formula : # patient ETP MCT cut-off progression DIC / # patient negative DIC score . Specific Aim # 2 : A multivariate analysis do determine predictor variable ( ETP , MCT , Pro C , Pro S , ATIII , FVL , ProG20210A , DIC ) associate secondary dichotomous outcome measure : organ dysfunction 28 day ( Any/None ) , 28-day mortality ( Dead/Alive ) .</detailed_description>
