	<brief_summary>This 28-day , multi-center , placebo-controlled study design look dose response , efficacy , safety SP01A , give pill swallow , treatment HIV-infected subject . Samaritan discover SP01A affect cholesterol binding , directly implicate pathogenesis HIV . It also establish drug nature exert anti-HIV effect in-vitro . These data suggest SP01A potential reduce HIV virus replication . One measurement HIV infect person ’ risk progress AIDS number viral particle HIV blood ( call “ viral load ” ) . This study design see SP01A low amount HIV infect individual 's blood . Patients assign chance 1 4 group . Neither patient study doctor nurse know dose study drug patient take he/she receive placebo ( capsule look like study drug contain active ingredient ) . Study drug administration continue 28 day . At end 28-day study , patient offer test his/her virus resistance approve drug ( genotype ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SP01A : The Study Oral Entry Inhibitor Treatment-Experienced HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently approve antiretroviral medication target either HIV viral reverse transcriptase ( RT ) , ( Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NRTIs ) Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) ) viral protease , ( Protease Inhibitors ( PIs ) ) inhibit viral fusion target cell ( Fusion Inhibitors ) . A regimen use combination agent consider standard care , effective , result suppression virus detection limit . However , long-term use antiretroviral therapy sometimes hamper poor compliance due pill burden , food restriction , major side effect impact Quality Life . Furthermore , one major reason therapy failure emergence resistant virus one anti-HIV medication , extent , entire class drug ( cross resistance ) . Enfuvirtide ( Fuzeon™ ) recently approve HIV-1 fusion/entry inhibitor , new class treatment prevents fusion HIV-1 virus CD4+ cell membrane prevent conformational change require fusion . Since mechanism action Enfuvirtide different class anti-HIV medication , effective patient fail therapy due emergence resistant virus . However , recent study demonstrate emergence resistance Enfuvirtide due mutation viral gp41 . The rapid rate mutation HIV-1 confer resistance virus current therapy continue necessitate need additional therapeutic agent . To end , hypothesis suggest regard immuno-modulating anti-viral effect SP01A treatment HIV infection . SP01A may affect cholesterol binding , directly implicate pathogenesis HIV . Several observation also establish inhibitor cholesterol synthesis inhibit cell fusion formation induce HIV-l drug extract cholesterol cellular membrane exert anti-HIV-1 effect in-vitro . Taken together , data may suggest procaine hydrochloride SP01A reduce HIV-1 virus replication modify cholesterol content cell membrane , render much difficult virus enter infect cell . There urgent need develop improved new therapeutic agent . SP01A , target different viral cellular component new mechanism action , develop test Samaritan Pharmaceuticals , Inc. new anti-viral therapeutic agent . This multi-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study orally administer SP01A monotherapy HIV-infected patient evidence resistance currently available antiretroviral therapy design evaluate dose response , efficacy , safety SP01A . HIV-positive patient evaluate pre-study period . Following 2-week washout period ( require ) , patient randomize one four study arm arm initiate 28-day monotherapy study . The first arm receive 200 mg SP01A QID . Arm Two receive 200 mg bid . The third arm orally administer 400 mg bid . Finally , fourth arm receive placebo twice daily . During treatment period , patient make five schedule visit treatment facility Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 . During visit patient monitor viral load general health parameter . At conclusion 28-day monotherapy study , patient optimize viral test treatment . On Day 43 , patient make final visit treatment facility post-study evaluation .</detailed_description>
