	<brief_summary>This phase I , open-label , randomized study NY-ESO-l protein immune adjuvant CpG 7909 Montanide® ISA-51 NY-ESO-l protein 400µg immune adjuvant CpG 7909 Montanide® ISA-51 patient tumor often express NY-ESO-1 . The vaccination administer subcutaneously every 3 week 4 dos . Patients malignancy know frequently express NY-ESO-1 eligible , regardless whether antigen expression autologous tumor demonstrate either PCR immunohistochemistry . The primary objective study define safety . Secondarily , study evaluate whether patient develop specific immunologic response NY-ESO-1 protein . Blood sample obtain baseline , prior vaccination , one week vaccination , last study visit assessment NY-ESO-1 specific CD4+ CD8+ T-cells . Cytokine secretion NY-ESO-1 specific CD8+ CD4+ T-cells , measure T-cell activation , determine FACS analysis . In addition , humoral immunity determine presence NY-ESO-1 specific antibody assess patient ELISA . Disease status assess baseline 2-4 week fourth vaccination patient evaluable ( measurable non-measurable disease ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NY-ESO-1 Protein With Montanide CpG 7909 Cancer Vaccine Several Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You receive investigational ( research ) cancer vaccine every 3 week total 4 treatment . It give injection underneath skin extremity ( leg arm ) . A vaccine compound design strengthen immune system ( cell substance protect body infection foreign matter ) fight illness infection cancer . This vaccine call NY-ESO-1 protein . NY-ESO protein ( antigen , compound recognize immune system ) find many cancer . Proteins NY-ESO-1 fragment target immune system need recognize cancer cell . If immune system recognize antigen ( foreign substance ) may able kill cell carry . NY-ESO-1 find different stage cancer , likely express ( show ) point lifecycle type cancer ( eligible study ) . Therefore study try boost ( strengthen ) immune system toward NY-ESO-1 protein regardless whether find tumor . Since know whether different dos NY-ESO-1 protein may result vary degree immune stimulation , randomize ( , flip coin , word , chance ) may receive either low dose NY-ESO-1 protein ( 100 µg ) high dose ( 400 µg . ) There 50:50 chance receive low versus high dose . At time way know whether real difference effect dos . In either case receive NY-ESO-1 protein . In study date , 100 µg dose use . There reason think high dose toxic , reason time think high dose effective immunological level , although may , reason compare effect two dos protein . The NY-ESO-1 protein vaccine mixed 2 substance , call adjuvant ( full name : CPG 7909 Montanide ISA-51 ) . Adjuvants substances increase vaccine 's ability stimulate immune system . By add two adjuvant vaccine , hop boost immune system especially effective . It important understand , vaccine experimental ( investigational , research ) treatment cancer . They approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment . Therefore offer clinical trial . All test treatment perform outpatient .</detailed_description>
