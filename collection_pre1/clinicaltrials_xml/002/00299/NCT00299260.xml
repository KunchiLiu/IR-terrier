	<brief_summary>Patients receive transplant increase risk develop serious cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection decrease immune system . The purpose study evaluate safety immune response CMV vaccine patient ( 18 year old old ) await transplant . Following immunization vaccine placebo ( inactive substance ) , patient follow development immune response CMV evidence CMV infection follow transplantation . One hundred forty eligible patient receive 3 injection CMV gB vaccine 3 dos placebo 5 visit . Participants participate study approximately 7 month ( undergo transplant ) 10 month ( undergo transplant ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) common infectious agent well adapt survival normal human host . Although CMV infection usually asymptomatic , CMV disease develop host : virus balance perturbed . This may occur individual become immunocompromised result immunosuppressive drug require maintain allograft . Currently vaccine prevention CMV infection . To reduce impact CMV infection , allograft transplant patient either give prophylaxis antiviral drug preemptive anti CMV therapy give soon indication productive infection serial sample blood . The primary objective study : determine recombinant soluble glycoprotein B cytomegalovirus vaccine immunogenic administer patient await transplantation kidney liver ; describe safety profile 0- , 1- , 6-month schedule CMV gB vaccine patient await transplantation . The secondary observational objective study : determine prior receipt vaccine reduce incidence quantity cytomegalovirus DNA detection blood post transplant among patient proceed transplantation ; determine prior receipt vaccine reduce incidence quantity CMV DNA detect blood post transplant , determine titer neutralize antibody induce complete course immunization correlate immune protection ; describe persistence vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody , include time patient give immunosuppressive drug require transplantation ; determine prior receipt vaccine reduce incidence quantity CMV DNA detect blood post transplant , determine titer neutralize antibody present time transplant correlate immune protection ; explore CD8 CD4 responses among patient proceed transplantation . This study phase II trial randomize , blind-observer , placebo-controlled design . Patients receive 3 injection 20 microgram CMV gB vaccine 3 dos placebo . Participants include 140 eligible patient ( 70 seronegative , 70 seropositive ) . Randomization stratify 4 group follow ; approximately 42 seronegative renal patient ; approximately 42 seropositive renal patient ; approximately 28 seronegative liver patient ; approximately 28 seropositive liver patient . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) follow 1 month last vaccination suspect unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSARs ) time follow-up period 90 day post-transplant . The primary immunogenicity endpoint include : level antibody ELISA anti-gB Days 0 , 28 , 56 , 180 , 208 [ ELISA Anti-gB ( IgG ) CMV neutralize antibody titer assess follow timepoints : one month first vaccination ; one month second vaccination ; one month third vaccination . ] ; titer neutralize antibody Days 0 , 28 , 56 , 180 , 208 . The primary safety endpoint occurrence , severity , onset , duration injection site reaction systemic reactions/events within 28 day follow injection SUSARs time follow-up period 90 day post-transplant . The observational endpoint measure patient proceed transplant include : increase viral load ( AUC/d ) among become PCR positive 90 day follow-up post transplant ; titer neutralize antibody detect time transplant Days 0 , 7 , 35 , 63 , 90 post transplant ; CD8 CD4 responses Days 0 , 7 , 35 , 63 , 90 post transplant .</detailed_description>
