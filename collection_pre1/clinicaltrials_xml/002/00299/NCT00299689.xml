	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Ontak With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II clinical trial determine whether administration ONTAK result significant response rate patient metastatic melanoma . Although development effective immunotherapy characterization multiagent chemotherapy regimens substantially improve treatment metastatic malignant melanoma , overall result remain dismal 6 % five year survival rate stage IV disease . Of common adult-onset cancer , melanoma widely hold amenable immunological intervention . The primary objective study determine response rate overall survival patient metastatic malignant melanoma treat two regimen ONTAK .</detailed_description>
