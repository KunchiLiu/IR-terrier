	<brief_summary>Group A streptococcus ( GAS ) cause variety human infection . It also uncommon serious cause postpartum infection . In contrast group B streptococcus ( GBS ) infection , cause illness death newborn disproportionately often mother , perinatal GAS infection primarily affect mother . Invasive GAS infection define isolation GAS normally sterile site ( e.g. , blood ) isolation GAS nonsterile site presence streptococcal toxic shock syndrome necrotizing fasciitis . A postpartum case invasive GAS define isolation GAS postpartum period , association clinical postpartum infection ( e.g. , endometritis ) either sterile site wound infection . Because burden severity invasive GAS infection , Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) host meet formulate guideline respond postpartum postsurgical GAS infection . However , could find recommendation long-term follow-up patient GAS infection subsequent delivery gynaecological procedure , recommendation regard subsequent delivery gynaecological invasive procedure . It possible woman GAS cause vaginal infection may tendency carrier organism , never proven . We believe importance determine woman one infection may long-term carrier may pose risk future pregnancy . The objective present study evaluate incidence long term gynaecological carrier state patient GAS invasive infection follow delivery , provide guideline follow-up treatment patient . The propose study may answer question whether endogenous GAS origin represent chronic GAS carrier state , similar know GBS carrier state . As patient severe infection ( sometimes life threaten ) protocol long-term follow management necessary case invasive procedure do ( IUD insertion , endometrial biopsy , curettage delivery ) order prevent recurrent infection . The information collect study enable u afford recommendation follow prophylaxis future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research plan The study population include patient diagnose GAS invasive infection follow delivery gynaecological procedure ( endometrial biopsy , D &amp; C IUD insertion ) Hadassah university hospital , patient isolation GAS vagina without infection report . The study consist two part , prospective retrospective . 1 . Retrospective study 1 . The record patient diagnose GAS infection/isolation past 3 year ( 2003-2005 ) review . The estimated occurrence GAS isolation genital tract Hadassah hospital 15 case every year ( Moses personal communication ) . 2 . Patients ' file review demographic clinical variable associate development GAS infection ( age , parity , obstetric history ) , clinical course subsequent progress septic shock , site GAS isolation ( blood , vaginal discharge , wound etc ) . 3 . Additional information obtain patient order evaluate incidence gynaecological infection risk factor infection . These include event pelvic inflammatory disease , contraceptive method , subsequent delivery D &amp; C ( questionnaire attach ) . 4 . Vaginal culture pharyngeal swab take woman previous gynecological GAS infection/isolation participate study , order evaluate whether carriage GAS vagina occur . 2. emm type Since original isolates woman invasive disease ( present bacteremia ) able compare specific type isolate obtain consequent culture original isolate . Isolates compare several know bacterial attribute emm type , T type , presence gene different exotoxin . emm type PCR streptococcal isolates perform previously describe [ 11 ] , accord recommendation Division Bacterial Mycotic Diseases , Streptococcus pyogenes emm sequence database ( http : //www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/doc.htm ) . 3 . Prospective study- In addition patient , woman present begin study two year , isolation GAS vagina ( even without overt disease ) , follow order evaluate significance isolates . These isolates collect comparison surveillance culture take future . Vaginal culture pharyngeal swab take every 2 month year .</detailed_description>
