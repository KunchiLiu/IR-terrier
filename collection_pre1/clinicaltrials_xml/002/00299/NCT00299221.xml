	<brief_summary>This study compare less intense immunosuppression traditional approach . The hypothesis less immunosuppression provide similar protection rejection typical 2-3 drug therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Outcomes Lower Immunosuppression Versus Traditional Immunosuppression Heart Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , control ( open-label ) trial 2 different strategy immunosuppression de novo post-heart transplant patient . The hypothesis immunosuppression tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil , couple rapid steroid weaning would provide similar anti-rejection efficacy tacrolimus 2 week course mycophenolate mofetil include rapid steroid wean . The primary endpoint mean International Society Heart Lung Transplantation ( ISHLT ) biopsy score first 6 month post-transplant . Secondary endpoint include incidence adverse event first year post-transplant , well all-cause mortality , 12 month ISHLT biopsy score ( mean ) , along incidence prove cytomegalovirus disease . In addition , incidence allograft vasculopathy assess angiography intravascular ultrasound compare group .</detailed_description>
