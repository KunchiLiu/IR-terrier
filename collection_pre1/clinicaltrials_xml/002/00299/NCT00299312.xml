	<brief_summary>Rett Syndrome ( RTT ) genetic brain disorder occur almost exclusively female usually cause change ( mutation ) gene MECP2 . The disorder characterize multiple developmental problem , well behavioral feature , repetitive stereotypic hand movement , include hand washing , wring , tap . While cure RTT , recent advance understand disease suggest development new , effective therapy promise . This study gather information genetic defect cause RTT , physical expression defect , disease progression . In turn , may direct development future treatment . Expanded study include individual MECP2 Duplication disorder , RTT-related disorder include individual MECP2 mutation , meet obligatory criterion diagnosis RTT individual mutation CDKL5 FOXG1 meet criterion atypical RTT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RTT brain disorder cause problem childhood development . It usually cause abnormality ( mutation ) gene MECP2 . RTT cause severe impairment movement communication skill , include speech social interaction . The first sign RTT include loss acquire speech loss purposeful hand use activity eat playing . Individuals may also develop abnormal walking , repetitive hand movement , clap wringing , abnormal breathe awake . Effective treatment RTT currently lack . There also inadequate information link RTT clinical feature genetic basis . In order prepare future clinical trial may lead effective therapy , important collect accurate information characteristic RTT pattern disease progression . This study gather historical physical examination data establish phenotype-genotype correlation . Data survival quality life female RTT male MECP2 gene mutation also evaluate . MECP2 Duplication disorder affect principally males one rarely one additional copy MECP2 well variable number duplicate gene . These male absent spoken language , shuffle gait , epilepsy , , , frequent upper respiratory infection sinusitis . Mother male generally normal due favorable skew X-chromosome inactivation , instance may neurodevelop-mental delay . Effective treatment lack . It critical develop phenotype-genotype correlation longitudinal natural history data assist conduct clinical trial . RTT-related disorder feature variety involvement either due MECP2 , CDKL5 , FOXG1 well potential cause atypical RTT . Phenotype-genotype study longitudinal natural history data essential conduct future clinical trial . Participants observational study recruit four site study conduct , well Rare Disease Clinical Research Network International Rett Syndrome Association ( IRSA ) . Prior study entry , potential participant expect tested mutation MECP2 gene . No treatment administer time study . Study visit occur every 6 month child 6 year old year thereafter . At study visit , participant examine assess physical characteristic disorder , motor behavior disease severity . Additionally , participant complete questionnaire medical history , contact information , quality life . The first visit last approximately 1.5 hour , every subsequent visit last approximately 1 hour .</detailed_description>
