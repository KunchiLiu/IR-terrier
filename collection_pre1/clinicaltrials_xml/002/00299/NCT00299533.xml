	<detailed_description>Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Treatment Refractory Epilepsy ABSTRACT Objective : The primary objective study determine whether polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) use safely effectively treatment epilepsy . Background : Patients intractable epilepsy often one medication experience intolerable side effect . Fatty acids show protective seizure animal model , little human data . Recently , however , small case series patient intractable epilepsy provide evidence anti-seizure effect without major side effect . There controlled trial PUFA human . Design/Methods : Patients uncontrolled partial generalize epilepsy characterize least 4 seizures/month randomize placebo vs. PUFA double-blind fashion . Subjects remain current drug ( ) 4-week baseline seizure count occur . Dosage titrate 1 week 1.1 gram twice daily , follow 15-week treatment phase monthly visit , seizure count , pill count , AED level , adverse event reporting , neurological examination . Quality life measure study use SF-36 QOLIE ( Quality Life Epilepsy ) -31 . If subject wish continue treatment , give opportunity end 20-week period , randomize placebo opportunity begin treatment PUFA . Analysis : The number subject achieve 50 % reduction seizure frequency 15-week treatment period relative 4-week prospective baseline compare treated vs. control group use Fisher 's exact test . Secondary endpoint include percent seizure reduction , analyze use Mann-Whitney test , quality life data , measure SF-36 QOLIE 31 . Conclusion : There sufficient preliminary data suggest PUFA effective well-tolerated treatment epilepsy . If efficacy , safety , tolerability PUFA confirm , propose study provide foundation large multi-center trial .</detailed_description>
