	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Dosing , Effectiveness Safety Topiramate Treatment Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Any number factor could affect dosage need anti-epileptic medication , however , various line evidence suggest characteristic patient 's epilepsy could important determinant . Baseline ( i.e. , start study ) patient characteristic , particularly seizure frequency , may predict dosage need TOPAMAXÂ® ( topiramate ) initiate monotherapy titrate individualized optimal dose . Topiramate anti-epileptic drug approve epilepsy either alone ( i.e. , monotherapy ) , combination anti-epileptic medication , adult child 2 year age . This multicenter , outpatient , open-label , single-arm study evaluate dosing , tolerability , effectiveness safety topiramate initial therapy epilepsy clinical practice . Patients identified physician candidate initial anti-epileptic monotherapy enrol . Patients begin therapy topiramate tablet start 50 milligram per day titrate individualized optimal dose , maximum 400 milligram per day , end week 6 . Changes schedule base risk-benefit assessment patient 's clinical condition investigator , tolerability , reach stable dose sufficient control seizures . Treatment topiramate last total 24 week . The primary outcome study comparison mean stabilize topiramate dose last 28 day treatment patient report 1 3 seizure 3 month prior study entry versus patient report 3 seizure 3 month prior study entry . The study hypothesis average stabilize dose topiramate lower patient few seizure 3 month prior begin study . Topiramate tablet start 50 milligram per day titrate individualized optimal dose , maximum 400 milligram per day end week 6 . Patients take topiramate tablet mouth twice day ( morning evening ) 24 week .</detailed_description>
