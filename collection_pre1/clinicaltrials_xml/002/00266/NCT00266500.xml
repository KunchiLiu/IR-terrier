	<brief_summary>This study investigate different part body lose body heat measure heat release specific area limbs abdomen . Animal study suggest dissipation body heat may affect energy expenditure , therefore , body weight . This study explore relationship obesity heat human . Healthy people 18 year age old normal weight obese take medication obesity-related medical condition may eligible study . Candidates must body mass index ( BMI ) 18 25 kg/m2 normal weight subject BMI great 30 kg/m2 obese subject . All candidate must weigh less 300 pound . Women must normal menstrual cycle postmenopausal . Participants undergo follow procedure single day outpatient basis : - Medical history , physical examination , blood urine test electrocardiogram . - DEXA MRI scan trunk limb measure amount muscle , bone fat body . For DEXA scan , subject lie table small dose x-ray pass body . For MRI , subject lie table move steel cylinder . A magnetic field radio wave produce image use measure fat trunk body , thigh , arm . - Infrared photography hand , front thigh , abdomen . A special camera use measure heat leave body . - Bicycle exercise test . The subject exercise stationary bicycle heart rate , heart rhythm , blood pressure oxygen consumption measure . The pedal resistance increase gradually subject long exercise resistance gradually decrease cool-down . Participants qualify second part study undergo follow procedure 5-day in-hospital stay : - Temperature measurement . Body temperature measure ear canal . Skin temperature measure small round adhesive temperature-sensing patch place abdomen limb 5 day . - Measurement body radiowaves . A remote sensing device use measure microwave naturally release body . - Infrared photography hand , front thigh abdomen do several time study . - Application mild coolness hand , thigh abdomen . The subject 's hand expose mild coolness first immersion cool water , cool-water spray , cool pad place hand , finally , device apply hand cool gentle vacuum . The abdomen thigh similarly expose . During test , infrared camera record heat release body . - Temperature effect `` meal . '' The subject drink lemon-flavored sugar water measure body 's response . - Bicycle exercise test . The subject exercise three different occasion . During test , mild cool applied abdomen , front thigh , hand . - Measurement exhale air ( indirect calorimetry ) . The subject wear hood collect analyze exhaled air 15- 30-minute period . - Photography videotaping . The subject photograph videotaped . The image include view private part , subject 's identity protect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Body Heat Content Dissipation Obese Normal Weight Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Animal model suggest dissipation body heat important physiological process may affect energy expenditure , thus may possibly modulate body weight . It unknown , however , deficient dissipation heat contribute human obesity , obesity induces deficits heat dissipation , relationship obesity heat human largely unexplored . We propose study obese ( BMI great equal 30 kg/m ( 2 ) ) normal weight ( BMI le equal 25 kg/m ( 2 ) ) adult determine possible obesity-related difference : 1 ) regional body temperature heterogeneity ( i.e. , presence localize area heat retention ) , 2 ) extent locally retain heat may co-localized deep fat depot , 3 ) effectiveness specific body locus ( e.g. , distal extremity ) dissipaters heat , 4 ) ability approach alter heat dissipation modify deep-body temperature heterogeneity . It hop result study provide preliminary evidence future study attempt facilitate weight loss obese subject effective , guide application heat management .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Volunteers qualify meet following criterion : 1 . Good general health . Individuals take medication obesityrelated comorbid condition generally exclude , consider casebycase basis . Participants nonsmoker . 2 . Age great equal 18 year . 3 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 18 27 kg/m ( 2 ) normal weight subject BMI great equal 30 kg/m ( 2 ) . To maximize difference group , overweight obese adult study . Body weight less 300 pound ( 136 kg ) , however , DXA scanners Clinical Center scan individual great size ) . 4 . For woman childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test initial evaluation . Since subject undergo Xray screening , safety purpose pregnant woman exclude participation study . 5 . For woman , normal menstrual cycle post menopausal status . Women normal cycle study 13 week follow last menstrual period . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( Overweight Subjects ) : Volunteers exclude ( refer treatment need ) follow reason : 1 . Presence major illness : renal ( serum creatinine great 1.6 ) , hepatic ( AST/ALT great 3 time upper limit normal range use Clinical Center assay ) , gastrointestinal , endocrinologic ( e.g. , Cushing syndrome , hyper untreated hypothyroidism ) , hematological problem pulmonary disorder ( asthma require continuous medication sleepapnea related disorder ) . The presence 'hunting ' reflex exclude patient . 2 . Pregnancy . 3 . Individuals current substance abuse , include smoking , psychiatric disorder condition opinion investigator would impede competence compliance , possibly hinder completion study ; 4 . Subjects regularly use prescription medication . Oral contraceptive use permit , provide contraceptive use least two month start study . Individuals take medication condition exclude , medication use consider casebycase basis . 5 . Weight change 3 % body weight past two month . 6 . Areas visualize IR deem investigator hirsute allow accurate measurement underlie tissue . 7 . Fat depth area measure 4 cm . 8 . Long nail would preclude wear snugfitting surgical glove . 9 . Weight excess 300 lb ( 136 kg ) would preclude scanned Clinical Center DXA machine . 10 . Individuals regularly participate highintensity physical activity , determine either selfreport analysis Past Year Total Physical Activity Questionnaire ( PYTPAQ )</criteria>
