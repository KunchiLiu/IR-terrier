	<brief_summary>The TE Registry multi-institutional bioinformatics database collection data relevant TE . Participating HTRS affiliate study center may enroll patient enter data TE Registry complete enrollment data entry form transmit study center . The purpose study improve understand epidemiology , pathophysiology , outcome patient suffer thromboembolism ( TE ) event . The initial objective registry : - Evaluate epidemiology clinical characteristic know prothrombotic risk factor person TE . - Identify frequency nature complication associate TE treatment . - Describe phenotypes complication see person multiple molecular risk factor TE . - Compare epidemiology , clinical characteristic , complication see patient without know risk factor TE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HTRS TE Registry ( ThromboEmbolism Registry )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hereditary defect predispose thromboembolism ( TE ) complication afflict 5-8 % U.S population . Annually , ~60,000 Americans die TE half survivor suffer long-term morbidity . Despite stagger statistic , little known clinical characteristic epidemiology inherit risk factor TE . Less known regarding acquire risk factor phenotype TE person multiple risk factor , yet preliminary data suggest many 10 % patient may multiple risk factor . Data several study , primarily involve adult subject , show population consecutively studied thrombosis patient , one five common inherit predisposition occur ~33.8 % . Antithrombin ( AT ) least common ( ~1.9 % ) , Factor V Leiden ( FVL ) common ( ~18.8 % ) . Most child suffer TE indwell catheter assist therapy underlie medical condition , sick neonate . Thus , contribution molecular risk factor child largely unknown , exception sparse retrospective data . The TE Registry may help clearly define clinical phenotype , epidemiology , complication see patient TE associate know molecular risk factor .</detailed_description>
