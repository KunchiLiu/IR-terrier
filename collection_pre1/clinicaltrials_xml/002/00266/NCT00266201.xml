	<detailed_description>Usually , `` heart failure '' refers myocardial insufficiency leave ventricle . In patient congenital heart defect , predominantly right ventricle secondarily right atrium pulmonary vasculature affect . Due advance treatment option result high life expectancy patient congenital heart defect , number patient increase steadily . As , patient , right ventricular failure often factor limit quality life life-span , evidence base drug treatment clinically important relevance respect health policy health economics . Concerning leave ventricular failure , large control randomised study past year provide evidence treatment beta-adrenergic blocker improve systolic leave ventricular function decrease mortality case leave ventricular failure . These therapeutic achievement corroborate hypothesis stimulation neurohumoral , particularly noradrenergic , system pathophysiological mechanism significant development leave ventricular failure . Large study demonstrate brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) sensitive biomarker activation noradrenergic system . Plasma level BNP closely correlate severity leave ventricular failure , qualify BNP also marker success/failure treatment . If right ventricular dysfunction also involve stimulation neurohumoral axis , conceivable BNP condition also sensitive biomarker activation noradregergic system . Under condition BNP level might also serve predictive marker clinical outcome success/failure therapy well . The objective present investigation ass predictive value BNP biomarker right ventricular function , clinical symptom and/or patient ' quality life . For purpose , blood level neurohumoral marker measure tested statistical correlation exercise tolerance right ventricular function , assess image method . A sample healthy volunteer serf control group .</detailed_description>
