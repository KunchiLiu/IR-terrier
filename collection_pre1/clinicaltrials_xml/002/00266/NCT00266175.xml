	<brief_summary>Postoperative stenosis pulmonary artery vascular system seldom occur alone ; frequently find connection congenital heart defect malformation syndrome . The resulting increase afterload represent serious pressure load right ventricle . Depending number severity stenosis , gradual functional right ventricular failure expect . Due limit clinical experience , yet consensus concern indication different therapeutic strategy ( balloon dilatation , stent implantation , surgical dilatation technique ) . Up , investigator centre use stent therapy . Therefore , systematic multicenter investigation assess large group patient undergoing procedure yet available . The applies novel dilatation technique , use `` cut balloon '' therapy rigid valve stenosis . By compare analyse different invasive form treatment ( balloon dilatation , stent implantation surgery ) , expect achieve optimisation therapy . In study , outcomes different strategy practiced German cardiological center compare main factor influence result determine . On basis standardize investigation one year intervention , comparison respect reduction stenosis corresponding change right ventricular functional anatomical change carry correct know confounders . The assessment different include invasive non-invasive diagnostical procedure respect ability detect pathological finding change result treatment important secondary target study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For patient untreated peripheral pulmonary stenosis , course disease characterise chronic pressure load right ventricle . In medium long term lead right heart failure cardiac arrhythmia unresponsive therapy . The probability event well time occurrence depend severity stenosis , duration stress possible additional volume load . Within scope prospective study introduce , intend characterise stenosis respect degree type document treatment success term decrease afterload right ventricle . In context , image catheter-based method well respective functional analysis use provide evidence reduction neutralisation pulmonary artery stenosis . Accordingly , follow question , correspond objective , identify base conduct clinical trial : - Morphological functional categorisation angiostenoses standardisation diagnostic procedure . For purpose , quantitative criterion morphological degree stenosis ( lumen constriction ) functional degree stenosis ( pressure gradient ) establish mean cardiac catheterisation angiography . Non-invasive imaging method , yet restrict primarily echocardiography , complement method spin angiography . Compared conventional angiography , advantage less invasive involve radiation exposure . - On strength past experience , implantation stent view promising approach treatment last effectiveness pulmonary artery stenosis . The stent advantage high radial force offset elastic recoil vessel occur sole dilatation . Furthermore , constriction cause either kink vessel compression neighbour structure dilate sufficiently use stent . - With respect interconnectedness project Competence Network Congenital Heart Defects , one essential aspect standardisation diagnostic method evaluate right ventricular function . The data obtain study provide basis development diagnostic guideline . - Concerning evaluation , particular attention pay patient ' self-assessment respect exercise tolerance . In context , matter interest degree patient ' subjective maximum stress therefore quality life correlate objective measurement parameter . The anticipated result direct clinical significance patient , aim medium long-term relief right ventricle , may effect decrease morbidity therefore improvement quality life . This particular importance regard fact continuously increase number patient congenital heart defect reach adulthood .</detailed_description>
