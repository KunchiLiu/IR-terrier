	<brief_summary>Tetralogy Fallot frequent complex congenital heart malformation . Over past five decade , surgical repair perform respectable result . However , relevant postoperative residue frequently remain . Pulmonary insufficiency , particular , identified factor limit right ventricular function , accordingly , quality life life expectancy . With increase use cardiac MRI measurement ventricular function image pulmonary artery , residual defect discover detectable echocardiography . There mount evidence right ventricular pressure volume stress Fallot patient surgical correction . At present , impossible detect right ventricular insufficiency early stage . Hence , assume right ventricular insufficiency underdiagnosed therapeutic action frequently initiate beyond point return ventricular function . The objective study systematic collection cross-sectional longitudinal data extensive standardised examination , include MRI , echocardiography , pulmonary function ergometry test , ECG quality life assessment , large number patient surgically correct tetralogy Fallot , setup database . The data obtain suppose provide information long-term outcome surgical correction , help establish criterion necessity time re-intervention re-operation , assess effectiveness re-interventions re-operations .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In repair tetralogy Fallot , pulmonary insufficiency use tacitly accept result extensive transannular patching ( TAP ) consider unobjectionable . In fact , well tolerate first postoperative year , today increase evidence result chronic volume stress right ventricle harmful long run , particular stenosis pulmonary artery addition . Such stenosis , partly due distortion shunt surgery , together pulmonary insufficiency , lead combine volume pressure load right ventricle . The chronic volume stress result decrease biventricular function exercise tolerance , associate increase electrical instability frequent , mostly ventricular , dysrhythmias . This constellation bring significantly increase risk cardiac death . Pulmonary valve replacement improve haemodynamics , exercise tolerance dysrhythmia . However , still unclear , criterion best indicate need re-operation re-intervention , balloon dilatation peripheral pulmonary stenosis , may best point time . Cardiac MRI establish non-invasive method quantify right left ventricular function without radiation exposure . Correlating quantitative functional data clinical condition may permit evaluation factor influence long-term course surgical repair Fallot 's tetralogy . The objective study establish broad database cross-sectional longitudinal ( one year ) finding extensive standardised examination , include MRI , echocardiography , pulmonary function ergometry test , ECG , quality life assessment perform cardiac catheterisation , indicate , large number subject surgically correct tetralogy Fallot . The data obtain suppose determine parameter indicate begin irreversibility decrease cardiac function , provide information long-term outcome surgical correction , help establish criterion necessity time re-intervention re-operation , assess effectiveness re-interventions re-operations .</detailed_description>
