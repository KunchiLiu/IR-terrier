	<brief_title>RayGel-An Alternative Skin Care During External Beam Radiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RayGel versus Placebo- An Alternative Skin Care External Beam Radiation Therapy RayGel formulation reduce glutathione anthocyanins extract various blue/purple flowering plant . Glutathione study variety way conjunction therapy direct cancer . It functional molecule , play significant role maintenance normal cellular metabolism regulation . Reduced glutathione play essential role DNA synthesis repair , well leukotriene prostaglandin metabolism . Studies look use glutathione reduce complication chemotherapy bone pain Taxol , urinary effect cyclophosphamide , neurotoxicity cisplatin . It show efficacy arena . External beam radiation standard part breast conservation treatment . It reduce rate loco regional recurrence significantly . Skin reaction vary degree occurs everyone go treatment . Occasionally , severe treatment schedule must alter allow heal . We would like study effect topical RayGel may reduce reaction skin external beam radiation therapy breast . Ineligibility criterion : 1 . Post mastectomy 2 . Previous irradiation breast 3 . Pregnancy 4 . Younger 18 year age Contraindication : 1.Hypersensitivity Study Design : Prospective blind randomize study . Enroll 150 patient . Group A - RayGel topical cream apply thin layer area expose radiation 60-90 minute prior radiotherapy , standard skin care treatment . Group B - Placebo topical cream apply thin layer area expose radiation 60-90 minute prior radiotherapy , standard skin care treatment . In addition , patient bright erythema reaction use skin product discretion radiation oncologist . Patients would consent prior start therapy . Digital photo radiation area would take start , ~ 5 week evaluate radiation oncologist use 0-6 Skin Reaction Scale . ( 0-no change 6-ulceration , hemorrhage necrosis ) . Weekly skin assessment documentation change would perform radiation oncology nurse radiation oncologist , use , 0-6 Skin Reaction Scale . Also weekly assessment patient comfort , use Legacy 's patient subjective pain rating , ( 0 pain 10 severe pain ) . Patients keep track pain time application study gel . They daily write calendar provide . A 5 question survey relate comfort complete study nurse last visit . Outcomes would measure degree skin reaction , discomfort , cosmetic outcome . Breaks treatment schedule , secondary skin change would record .</detailed_description>
