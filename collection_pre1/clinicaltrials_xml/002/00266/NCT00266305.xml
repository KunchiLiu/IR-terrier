	<detailed_description>Background : Studies indicate infant , feed formula without n-3 LCPUFA , slow visual development , receive n-3 LCPUFA breast-milk . The mental development seem also depend whether infant breast-fed . Long-term health also propose affect ( The infant origin adult disease hypothesis ) . It clear whether difference due dietary LCPUFA comparison breast-fed formula-fed infant complicate socio-demographic difference exist mother , choose breast-feed . Recent study indicate LCPUFA supplementation formula beneficial effect visual acuity mental ability infant . The LCPUFA content breast-milk varies could potentially importance infant development . Methods : 211 pregnant woman high ( &gt; 80 percentile ) low ( &lt; mean ) fish intake recruit . After birth mother low fish intake randomize receive 4 g/day fish oil olive oil first 4 month lactation period . 150 mother-infant pair follow 1 year gathering information maternal n-3 LCPUFA intake infant development ( growth , developmental milestone , visual acuity , cognitive function language acquisition ) . Milk sample collect 0 , 2 , 4 9 month blood sample take mother infant 4 month age order determine biochemical effect supplementation . The child followed-up 2Â½ year age around 7 year age .
