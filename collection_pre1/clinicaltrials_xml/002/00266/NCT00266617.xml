	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Epoetin Alfa Patients With Anemia Result Advanced Cancer Treatment With Aggressive Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing treatment adriamycin-containing chemotherapy frequently develop significant anemia . Agents increase amount hemoglobin cancer patient undergoing treatment non-platinum-containing cyclic chemotherapy may improve patient ' reduce physical strength reduce stamina result anemia , improve patient ' ability continue chemotherapy , improve patient ' overall qualify life . Epoetin alfa genetically engineer form natural hormone , erythropoietin , use treat anemia stimulate red blood cell production . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multicenter study . The study evaluate safety effectiveness epoetin alfa treat patient develop persistent anemia result treatment aggressive non-platinum-containing cyclic chemotherapy cancer type ( except rapid severe onset leukemias malignancy bone marrow spleen ) . The study consist screen period patient ' eligibility determine , 12-week double-blind treatment period patient receive 3 injection week either epoetin alfa placebo , optional open-label treatment period patient choose continue receive 3 injection epoetin alfa per week remain cycle chemotherapy . Eligible patient randomly assign one two treatment group : one group receive epoetin alfa 150 units/kilogram group receive comparable volume placebo . Study drug administer injection beneath skin 3 time weekly 12 week . The dose study medication may increase decreased discretion physician , base result blood test . Depending patient 's chemotherapy cycle , return study site every 3 4 week administration study medication . Safety evaluation ( laboratory test , vital sign measurement , report adverse event , physical examination , electrocardiogram ) perform throughout study . The primary measure effectiveness study drug determine number transfusion patient require change blood test result hemoglobin , hematocrit , reticulocyte ( immature red blood cell ) start study end study . The study hypothesis epoetin alfa , effectively placebo , stimulate adequate production red blood cell increase hemoglobin level cancer patient anemic result undergo treatment aggressive non-platinum-containing cyclic chemotherapy . Double-blind : Epoetin alfa 150 units/kilogram ( U/kg ) matching volume placebo inject beneath skin 3 time weekly 12 week . Open-label : Epoetin alfa dose receive end double-blind study inject beneath skin 3 time weekly remain cycle chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
