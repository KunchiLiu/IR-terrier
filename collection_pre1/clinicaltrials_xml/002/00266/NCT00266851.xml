	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effectiveness azalide macrolide azithromycin adult persistent asthma . Research Question : Will 12-week treatment antibiotic , azithromycin , result statistically significant clinically meaningful improvement overall asthma symptom patient-oriented asthma outcome one year initiation treatment adult primary care patient asthma ? Experimental Design : The investigator propose one-year randomize , placebo-controlled , blind ( investigator , patient , data collector , data analyst ) trial 12 weekly dos azithromycin/placebo adjunctive therapy ( addition usual care ) 100 adult asthma patient recruit practice-based research network ( e.g. , Wisconsin Research Education Network ( WREN ) others ) . This `` practical clinical trial '' ( 1 ) enroll representative sample asthma patient encounter practice primary care physician , ( 2 ) employ standard clinical trial methodology ensure internally valid result ( 3 ) measure outcomes important patient , result valid applicable kind asthma patient encounter family physician primary care provider .

	<detailed_description>1.0 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Approximately 100 eligible adult patient physician-diagnosed asthma randomize 12-week treatment azithromycin , widely market azalide antibiotic excellent safety profile , identical placebo adjunctive therapy usual care asthma . The following patient-reported data collect via Zoomerang™ ( commercially-available data collection tool ) periodically one year randomization : ( 1 ) study medication adherence side effect weekly 12 week , ( 2 ) asthma control exacerbation every 6 week 12 month , ( 3 ) asthma quality life asthma controller medication change every 3 month 12 month . The primary hypothesis azithromycin significantly improve asthma control ( decrease symptom medication use ) 3 month ( end treatment ) improvement continue 12 month ( end study ) . The primary outcome variable overall asthma symptom . Secondary outcome asthma medication use , quality life exacerbation . We examine predictive value baseline patient characteristic include age , sex , smoking , co-morbid respiratory diagnosis degree airflow limitation . We also examine imbalance study group controller medication use , antibiotic prescription acute respiratory illness one-year study period . We enroll subject practice Wisconsin Research Education Network ( WREN ) member , UW Department Family Medicine physician , Dean Medical Center primary care physician , practice-based research network ( PBRNs ) , medical group practice individual primary care practice throughout North America . Patients physician-diagnosed asthma age 18 old identify point-of-service ( office , urgent care , emergency room hospital ) , administrative data base review , physician recall . Most subject patient study physician . Other physician group practice may refer subject . Subjects also may self-referred respond poster place clinic . Some site may elect identify case medical record database review , case personal physician may initiate patient contact . Treatment azithromycin tablet , 600 milligram orally daily 3 day , 600 milligram weekly additional 11 week ( total dose 8400 milligram ) identical placebo , addition usual care asthma .</detailed_description>
