	<detailed_description>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) one common chronic liver disease . The cause NASH completely understand currently effective treatment disease . An effective approach treatment need since without treatment disease may progress fibrosis cirrhosis . Obesity one important risk factor NASH weight reduction generally recommend initial step management . However , never randomize control trial evaluate efficacy weight reduction treatment NASH . Data uncontrolled trial use poorly define primary outcome measure patient population nonstandardized weight loss intervention suggest modest weight loss may improve liver histology . The objective project conduct pilot study preparation randomize control trial weight reduction management NASH . In study , 30 overweight obese individual biopsy-proven NASH enrol . Twenty patient randomize receive 48 week intensive weight management use combination diet , exercise behavior modification goal 7-10 % weight reduction . This weight loss program similar program use successfully overweight population intensive lifestyle program Diabetes Prevention Program Look AHEAD . The 10 patient randomize control group receive standard medical care general counseling healthy eating exercise . At end 48-week study , patient repeat liver biopsy compare baseline biopsy . The pilot study establish feasibility recruit retaining , produce sustained weight loss perform repeat liver biopsy population . Based outcomes preliminary trial , program refine readied larger-scale clinical trial .</detailed_description>
