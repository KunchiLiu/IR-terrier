	<brief_summary>This study investigate gene abnormality Primary Immune Deficiency ( PID ) goal improve diagnosis treatment patient . The specific disorder include : 1 . X link hyper IgM Syndrome cause abnormality CD40L gene . 2 . NEMO associate immune deficiency cause abnormality gene call NEMO . 3 . Common variable immunodeficiency ( CVID ) unknown genetic basis . 4 . Other disorder immunoglobulin production . This study : 1 . Better characterize clinical feature CD40 L deficiency NEMO associate immune deficiency relate primary immune deficiency syndrome . 2 . Determine frequency CD40 L Nemo abnormality . 3 . Determine whether particular abnormality gene associate less severe illness specific symptom . 4 . Explore basic mechanism alter gene cause immune dysfunction . 5 . Identify gene cause low immune globulin level relate primary immune deficient state .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol design study genetics pathophysiology Hyper-IgM syndrome , NEMO associate immune deficiency , patient related primary immune deficiency disorder , blood relative immunodeficient patient . Patients undergo evaluation include history/physical , blood sampling , genetic testing , possible tissue sample . Among aim protocol good understand genetic factor lead defect host defense , use modern evolve method molecular cellular biology elucidate pathogenesis disease . A good understanding primary immunodeficiency could allow rational development novel therapy diseases benefit future patient , might benefit current patient directly . Routine follow-up may occur every six month - evaluation blood sample . Under circumstance , may provide treatment relate immune deficiency . These treatment follow standard medical practice .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient must know suspected immune defect hyperIgM syndrome and/or disorder immunoglobulin production . There limit age , sex , race , disability . Normal volunteer must healthy adult age 18 70 year . All study participant enrol study must agree allow PI store research sample . Refusal let PI store sample may lead withdrawal fro specific study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The presence acquire abnormality , lead immune defect , HIV , chemotherapy , malignancy general exclusion criterion . Refusal let u store sample may lead withdrawal specific study . Other factor , judgment Principal Investigator PI may interfere patient evaluation determine pose add risk study participant also criteria exclusion .</criteria>
