	<criteria>Signed informed consent study parent guardian . Assent obtain minor 11 year age old . Age old equal 3 year young equal 30 year Endoscopic finding consistent EE ( edema , furrowing , exudate , ring ) Histological finding include proliferation basal layer peak eosinophil density ≥24 per high power field ( 400x ) . This degree tissue eosinophilia show correlate well poorresponsiveness acid suppression therapy , suggest primary eosinophilic disease secondary GERD [ 11 ] . Allergy evaluation include skinprick test multiple food antigen insure elimination diet indicate . If allergic specific food , option minimum 3 month elimination diet without detectable resolution repeat endoscopy biopsy demonstrate improvement disease . Patients enrol CCHMC direct care Dr. Putnam staff gastroenterologists institution supervise endoscopic procedure . Patients may also enrol institution CCHMC , diagnosis EE must validate expert pathologist EE CCHMC ( Margaret Collins , MD ) . 20 additional patient without EE enrol unaffected control purpose comparison patient EE . Enrollment pool comprise patient undergo routine upper endoscopy identifiable pathology .
