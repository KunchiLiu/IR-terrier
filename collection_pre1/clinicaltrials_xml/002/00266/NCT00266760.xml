	<brief_summary>Episodic ataxia ( EA ) rare genetic disease characterize episode imbalance , incoordination , slur speech . The underlying cause EA partly understand , currently establish treatment . There also little information link EA 's clinical feature genetic basis . The purpose study well characterize EA disease progression . In turn , may direct development future treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characteristics Episodic Ataxia Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attacks ataxia , loss ability coordinate muscular movement , often trigger stress exertion . EA likely cause inherited genetic mutation ; many individual EA abnormality KCNA1 CACNA1A gene . To date , two know subtypes EA identify , type likely exist . Specific characteristic EA subtype , however , adequately describe . The purpose study well define clinical feature genetic basis various subtypes EA evaluate disease progression . The study also establish relevant study endpoint use future therapeutic trial . This multi-center observational study involve cross-sectional data analysis prospective longitudinal analysis . Participants initially attend outpatient study visit last 7 hour . This initial evaluation include medical history , physical examination , neurological testing , ataxia assessment . Blood collect genetic testing . Additionally , follow procedure may conduct : ocular motor test , electromyography/nerve conduction study , electroencephalogram , MRI , digital videotaping . Follow-up evaluation occur yearly basis least 2 year ; last 4 hour .</detailed_description>
