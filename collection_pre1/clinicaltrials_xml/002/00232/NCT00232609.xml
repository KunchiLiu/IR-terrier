	<brief_title>Development GameCycle Exercise System : Phase II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research project develop test effectiveness novel exercise system wheelchair user , GAMECycle . People wheelchairs desire exercise face barrier respect access exercise equipment availability exercise equipment specifically suitable use wheelchair . The GAMECycle exercise system remove barrier offer wheelchair user entertaining , motivational environment exercise . The long-term goal improve overall activity level individual use wheelchairs primary mean mobility increase general well . The GAMECycle Exercise System modify arm-ergometer sits turnstile allow steer much way arm-cycle . More specifically , crank pedal set turn use arm , similar bicycle turn foot . When use system , subject seat wheelchair front system comfortably position able grasp handle use arm crank . The GAMECycle design provide upper body aerobic exercise environment ( computer game play ) help make exercise enjoyable , among thing , distract people less pleasant aspect exercise . Although upper-body exercise system wheelchair user exist , GAMECycle unique ability combine arm-ergometry playing computer videogames . And , contrast wheelchair roller system , arm-ergometry provide GAMECycle affords user exercise option use motion differs significantly motion wheelchair propulsion . This research consist two phase : Training Phase In Home Trial Phase . The training phase last maximum two hour In Home Phase last 4 month . Subjects complete Training Phase ask participate In Home Trial . Training Phase The purpose training session determine user ability reach maintain target aerobic training zone 15 minute exercise trial , teach new user use GAMECycle Exercise System , obtain feedback new user regard perceived comfort , fit , ease use . A GAMECycle exercise system set participate local rehab research facility . A clinician ensure GAMECycle adjusted fit user . The amount resistance arm-ergometer adjust level feel comfortable exercise . Heart rate breathe rate monitor 15-minute exercise session . Subjects rate level exertion every 2 minute 15-minute exercise phase ask complete questionnaire opinion GAMECycle System . In Home Phase This phase involve 4-month trial period divide 2 two-month session . For two month , subject ask use GAMECycle two month , subject ask use arm-ergometer . It randomly determine whether GAMECycle arm-ergometer use first . Subjects require record exercise session follow member research team telephone . In addition , month four month , member research staff visit participant portable metabolic cart heart rate monitor order collect heart rate date , metabolic date ( VO2 , VCO2 ) , rating perceive exertion use Borg scale . This data collect exercise without game play , depend condition session .</detailed_description>
