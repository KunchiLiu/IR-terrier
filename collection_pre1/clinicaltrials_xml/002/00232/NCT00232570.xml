	<detailed_description>Quetiapine frequently use treat psychosis patient Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) dementia . These patient commonly sleep disturbance include nighttime awakening confuse , agitated behavior . These awakening impose great challenge caregiver , especially family caregiver whose sleep disrupt result patient 's awakening .

No large trial AD subject report literature drug potential benefit AD patient sleep disturbance . There several reason population need specifically study . Patients AD tend highly fragmented sleep , many nocturnal awakening . They significant daytime sleepiness might affect daytime cognitive function behavior . These patient tend old , sensitivity drug side effect . People neurodegenerative disease AD may respond differently CNS-active medication . Finally , population represent large grow cohort patient deserve individual study unique problem .</detailed_description>
