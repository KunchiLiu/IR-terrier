	<brief_title>Quetiapine Cocaine Use Cravings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dopaminergic serotonergic neurotransmitter system involve cocaine use craving . Atypical antipsychotic act neurotransmitter system , therefore , may beneficial treatment cocaine addiction . This open label study assess efficacy quetiapine treatment cocaine use crave non-psychotic , cocaine dependent participant 6 week treatment . The primary outcome measure include self-report cocaine use self-report cocaine craving . This study also evaluate whether severity addiction predict quetiapine efficacy . Males female , age 18 - 65 , DSM IV diagnosis cocaine dependence recruit open label trial quetiapine dose 300-600 mg/day , target dose 600 mg/day . Subjects follow weekly study visit monitor general psychiatric physical status , medication compliance , efficacy , adverse event . Study participation include psychiatric medical examination , electrocardiogram , eye exam , laboratory test , urine drug screen , electrocardiogram , psychiatric substance abuse interview . Twenty-three male initiate quetiapine treatment , follow result include first twenty-two study completers . Twenty-two male ( 36-56 year ) diagnose cocaine dependence without psychotic disorder , initiate six-week , open-label trial quetiapine , 300-600 mg/day ( QHS ) . Five participant discontinue prior complete first week treatment , 14 22 subject complete study . The mean dose quetiapine 429 mg/day . An intent-to-treat analysis find significant decrease craving Brief Substance Craving Scale six week ( p &lt; 0.01 , Cohen 's = 1.23 ; repeat measure mixed effect random regression ) . Cocaine use , addiction severity , psychopathology also decrease numerically , statistically , baseline end study . Adverse effect generally mild . Addiction severity predict quetiapine efficacy . Four subject withdraw due sedation ; 2 discontinue investigator , 2 lose follow . Study completers experience statistically significant mean weight gain approximately 4.60 ( 95 % CI , -6.05 - 3.17 kg ) ( mean baseline weight 86.9 ( SD 18.38 ) kg ) . Quetiapine treatment appear improved cocaine dependence , specifically cocaine craving , non-psychotic individual . The observed weight change may reflect weight gain associate cocaine dependence medication side effect . Controlled research warrant good define potential role quetiapine treatment cocaine dependence .</detailed_description>
