	<brief_summary>In early study , eplerenone show improve survival patient heart failure immediately follow heart attack . However , know patient establish mild-to-moderate heart failure ( NYHA Class II ) , additional risk sudden death , respond treat eplerenone . In trial , eplerenone plus standard heart failure medicine compare placebo plus standard heart failure medicine term additional ability prolong life prevent re-hospitalizations worsen heart failure patient . The Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) observe conduct protocol-specified second interim analysis 6th May , 2010 efficacy eplerenone meet pre-specified stopping rule protocol . As result discussion DSMC Executive Steering Committee ( ESC ) , ESC recommend EMPHASIS-HF terminate , Based convince efficacy consideration would unethical offer treatment patient , ESC recommend patient trial transfer open-label eplerenone . The Open Label Extension eplerenone arm last 12 month . Eplerenone currently approve indication study patient population . On May 26 , 2010 , enrollment EMPHASIS-HF stop . The amendment consider appropriate way ensure subject participate double-blind phase EMPHASIS-HF trial offer treatment eplerenone</brief_summary>
