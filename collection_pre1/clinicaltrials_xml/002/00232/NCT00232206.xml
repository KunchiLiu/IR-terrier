	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess response rate treatment two cycle cisplatin docetaxel chemotherapy prior surgery ( neoadjuvant ) early stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Secondary objective study include assessment radiographic response rate compute tomography ( CT ) scanning , overall survival , time progression , rate complete surgical removal , adverse reaction . In addition , study test whether positron emission tomography ( PET ) image predict tumor response . Patients response chemotherapy may receive 2 additional cycle recover surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Neoadjuvant Docetaxel Cisplatin Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account 80 % new lung cancer diagnose US . Surgery primary successful treatment early stage patient . However , even lung cancer catch early stage ( stage IB select IIIA ) 5 year survival surgery rate 10-60 % . Postoperative platinum base chemotherapy offer 4-15 % survival benefit , depend stage fit patient complete surgical removal early stage disease . Preoperative platinum base chemotherapy show small randomized trial benefit patient stage IIIA , N2 positive disease , standard care earlier stage disease , population study . The combination cisplatin docetaxel approve US front line therapy stage IV NSCLC base randomized clinical data show efficacy manageable toxicity . Given efficacy tolerance combination metastatic setting , regimen obvious choice study neoadjuvant setting . PET image approve US determine size , site spread lung cancer ( stag ) show reduce unnecessary surgery use part preoperative evaluation . Because NSCLC 100 % responsive chemotherapy CT scan may show change tumor size several cycle chemotherapy , PET image might effective way provide earlier reliable estimate response . Preoperative chemotherapy give total two cycle 21 day apart adverse event resolve evidence disease progression . Patients undergo CT chest liver PET scan restaging follow second cycle schedule surgery 3-6 week second cycle chemotherapy . Patients respond accord CT and/or PET imaging , surgical pathology go receive additional two cycle chemotherapy docetaxel cisplatin patient recover surgery .</detailed_description>
