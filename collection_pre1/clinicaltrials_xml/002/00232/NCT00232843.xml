	<brief_title>The Study Treat Superficial Femoral Artery Occlusions .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , prospective , randomize , two-arm study evaluate performance Cordis SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent compare angioplasty . It anticipate total 150 patient enter study . Patients randomize 1:1 basis stent versus angioplasty . 150 patient de novo restenotic native SFA occlusion ( 5-22 cm ) reference vessel &gt; = 4.0 &lt; = 6.0 mm diameter randomize SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent angioplasty . All patient follow 12 month post-procedure , telephone contact 3 6 month , 12 month clinical duplex ultrasound assessment . This study conduct 12 investigational site .</detailed_description>
