	<brief_title>Efficacy Galantamine Treat Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A majority patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder experience impairment social relation employment . Many patient experience impairment ability live independently , require assistance activity money management , shopping , food preparation hygiene . These impairment function show related cognitive deficit associate disease . Galantamine medication approve FDA treatment mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease . Both animal human model show galantamine enhance learn memory . Case report preliminary research suggest galantamine effective adjunctive treatment schizophrenia , improve cognition negative symptom . Improvements function require gain cognition maintain long enough allow acquisition application new skill behavior . Thus , nine month , open label study assess efficacy galantamine , dose 4-12 mg/twice day , treatment functional impairment individual , age 18-60 , schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . The primary outcome measure change baseline end study score Independent Living Scale ( ILS ) Quality Life Scale ( QLS ) . Secondary outcome measure include assessment symptom , cognition , side effect , movement disorder . Twenty-one subject sign informed consent fourteen subject initiate medication . Six subject complete study . As per priori plan , subject ( n = 8 ) treat study medication least four month include analysis treatment outcomes . Our finding regard efficacy galantamine functional outcome , include activity daily live quality life , support hypothesis long-term treatment galantamine would yield improvement domains patient schizophrenia spectrum disorder . In fact , current study , observe anticipated improvement cognition . In addition , observe anticipate improvement symptom , specifically negative symptom .</detailed_description>
