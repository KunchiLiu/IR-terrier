	<detailed_description>We intend test randomize , rater blind , placebo control , prospective study primary hypothesis escitalopram-rTMS-combination treatment efficacious treatment refractory major depression assess Hamilton Depression Rating Scale compare placebo . A second hypothesis treatment MDE escitalopram ( mean `` Placebo group '' ) alone lead typical change like - An increase neurotrophic factor concentration ( measure blood concentration nerve growth factor ( NGF ) brain derive nerve growth factor ( BDNF ) , - An increase hippocampal metabolite ( measure magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS - An increase motor cortical inhibitory activity ( measure motor evoke potential ( MEP - An increase serotonergic activity ( measure EEG parameter , Moreover , hypothesize similar pronounced change occur group treat combination treatment .</detailed_description>
