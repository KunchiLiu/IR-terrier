	<brief_title>VERTOS-II . Percutaneous Vertebroplasty Versus Conservative Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : This multicenter ( 6 center ) , prospective , randomize , intervention study . Eligible patient randomize percutaneous vertebroplasty analgesic . Study population : Two hundred patient include . Patient selection : Patients refer GP radiology department acute back pain . The GP order X-ray thoracic lumbar spine establish osteoporotic vertebral fracture ( ) . Subsequently , hospital radiologist pick case vertebral fracture ( ) . Subsequently , general physician/ geriatrician confirm diagnosis 'osteoporotic ' vertebral fracture , exclude cause vertebral fracture ( e.g . tumour , major trauma ) . Finally , patient GP ask participate study . Eligible patient randomize percutaneous vertebroplasty ( pain medication necessary ) analgesic . Procedure : The treatment consist transpedicular injection polymethylmethacrylate bone cement collapse vertebral body ( maximal 2 vertebrae 1 treatment session ) use fluoroscopic guidance . The procedure perform use local anesthetic patient discharge day 1 night hospital stay . Conventional treatment ( analgesic ) : The internist optimize use analgesic ascend order : ( 1 ) Paracetamol , ( 2 ) Tramadol , ( 3 ) Tramadol Paracetamol , ( 4 ) Morphine . All patient receive osteoporosis medication . Outcome parameter : The primary outcome clinical study well economic evaluation adequate relief pain . Pain intensity measure mean visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Relief 3,0 4,4 scale point ( scale 0-10 ) associate clinically relevant pain reduction ( Beurskens et al 1995 ) . The main goal economic evaluation ass balance cost effect percutaneous vertebroplasty pain medication compare usual care ( analgesic , physiotherapy , visit general practitioner ) 4 week 1 year . The clinical research objective compare effect ( 1 day,1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 months,12 month 24 month ) vertebroplasty conventional therapy ) back pain , b ) activity daily live ( ADL ) , c ) mood , ) general health e ) quality life patient painful osteoporotic vertebral fracture . Other objective study 1 2-year incidence recurrent fracture , especially adjacent treated level Measurements : ) , b ) , c ) , ) e ) measure use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) pain intensity , Roland Disability Questionnaire ( RDQ ) functional status , , EQ6D Qualeffo-41 focus quality life , mood general health . Data collect unit resource utilization explicit clause ask whether related vertebral fracture . ( New ) osteoporotic vertebral fracture assess baseline conventional radiography magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging . The incidence recurrent fracture determine conventional X-rays 1,3,12 24 month . Economic evaluation : The goal economic evaluation ass balance cost effect vertebroplasty compare usual care . We initially perform cost-effectiveness analysis one month time horizon . Given immediate pain relief majority vertebroplasty , already cost-effectiveness ratio calculate . Estimates relevant outcome cost quality life also enter model allow full economic evaluation . We estimate incremental cost per additional year free pain immediate vertebroplasty compare vertebroplasty one month ( synthetic scenario ) care usual . As latter involve extrapolation use estimate actually observe trial use bootstrap simulation ass uncertainty . Accordingly , multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis ( Monte carlo simulation ) use evaluate uncertainty cost-effectiveness ratio . As take account time horizon till one year cost effect discount . Finally , cost-utility analysis foreseen base utility score obtain first month observation randomization . The direct medical cost estimate societal perspective . This imply resource use GP visit , analgesic , physiotherapy consultation orthopedic surgeon general physician record CRF patient diary . In parallel , actual cost resource , i.e. , unit cost , estimate . The majority base estimate gather Dutch guideline economic evaluation publish CVZ . Subsequently , multiplication unit cost resource use yield cost estimate individual patient level . With regard cost due loss productivity pose majority patient pay job . Time spent spouse , family friend take certain household activity unpaid activity account use shadow price . The primary outcome economic evaluation adequate relief pain . Pain measure mean visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Relief 3,0 4,4 scale point consider adequate . Time outcome attain explicitly account economic evaluation . In addition pain , health relate quality life measure . Subsequent summation period follow yield overall QALYs year arm trial . In cost effectiveness analysis take care difference Belgium Dutch healthcare system . Statistical analyzes All analyzes perform intention treat principle . In addition , analyze different outcome compare two group Student 's t-test continuous normally distributed variable , Mann-Whitney test variable normally distribute chi² test categorical variable . In addition , subgroup ( e.g . long/shot duration complaint ) examine vertebroplasty ( less ) pronounce effect introduce interaction term linear regression model change pain quality life outcome variable . The one-year cumulative incidence new fracture adjacent treated/old fracture level compare patient treat vertebroplasty Cox-proportional hazard analyzes , adjust confounders . Power calculation : The planned number subject 200 total , 100 intervention arm . This number base conventional assumption alfa=0.05 ß=0.20 , withdrawal intervention 20 % . Based pilot data literature expect difference 25 % significant pain relief . If assume 20 % withdraws intervention need approximately 100 patient group . Time schedule : The total study take 36 month . Recruitment patient ( 200 ) complete . In May 2009 1 year follow-up finish .</detailed_description>
