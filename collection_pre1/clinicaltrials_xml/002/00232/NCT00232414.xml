	<brief_summary>In study , quetiapine test possible treatment bipolar I disorder acute depressive episode child adolescent . We hypothesize quetiapine efficacious placebo treatment episodes major depression associate adolescent BP . Moreover , hypothesize quetiapine safe well-tolerated compare placebo treatment depression associate adolescent BP . Based data BOLDER study study atypical antipsychotic patient bipolar depression ( Calabrese et al. , 2004 , Macfadden et al. , 2004 , Tohen et al. , 2004 ) , general reveal effect size approximately 0.5 , conservative sample size calculation , assume power .8 , estimate would need approximately 15 patient group identify statistically significant group difference main outcome measure , change form baseline endpoint Children 's Depression Rating Scale ( Poznanski , 1979 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Double-Blind Randomized Placebo Controlled Study Quetiapine Treatment Depression Adolescents With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize 56-day treatment trial quetiapine vs. placebo treatment bipolar adolescent acute depression . Randomization stratify sex , presence psychotic feature , site specific randomization schedule determine . Stratification randomization sex necessary control high rate co-occurring ADHD male females bipolar disorder . Bipolar disorder ADHD may treatment refractory bipolar disorder without ADHD . Stratification presence psychosis necessary avoid patient psychosis assign one treatment group . A randomization schedule develop Children 's Hospital Medical Center Investigational Pharmacy . Procedures Thirty adolescent hospitalize episode major depression associate BP , type I , ( age 12-18 ) recruit study two year . After provide informed consent ( parent legal guardian ) , inform assent ( child ) , sign document ( parent child ) , subject evaluate use Washington University St. Louis Kiddie-Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia ( K-SADS , Geller et al. , 1998 ) raters extensive training instrument establish inter-rater reliability ( ICC &gt; 0.9 ) ( DelBello et al. , 2004 ) . The WASH-U K-SADS semi-structured clinical interview establish validity reliability assess presence DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorder child adolescent ( Geller et al. , 1998 ) . The K-SADS involve interview child another interview parent . If diagnosis bipolar disorder , type I , current episode depress confirm K-SADS , follow scale also perform : 1 . The Children 's Depression Rating Scale ( CDRS ) ass severity depressive symptom ( Poznanski et al. , 1979 ) ; 2 . The Young Mania Scale ( YMRS ) ass severity manic symptom ( Fristad et al. , 1992 ; Young et al. , 1978 ) ; 3 . The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) ass severity anxiety symptom ( Hamilton , 1959 ) 4 . The Clinical Global Impression Scale BP Version ( CGI-BP ) quantify child 's overall baseline functioning ( National Institute Mental health , 1985 ) ; The CGI-BP use clinician record severity illness time assessment . The score range 1 ( normal , ill ) 7 ( among extremely ill patient ) . At visit follow baseline , also perform CGI-BP Improvement Scale quantify change baseline overall functioning . The score range 1 ( much improve ) 7 ( much bad ) . 5 . The Simpson-Angus Scale ( Simpson Angus , 1970 ) , Barnes Akathisia Scale ( Barnes 1989 ) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS , US Department Health , 1976 ) ass extrapyramidal symptom . Patients receive prior treatment lithium valproate must serum concentration &lt; 0.4 mEq/L 50 mg/L respectively receive quetiapine placebo . Patients treat antipsychotic ( po IM , non-depot ) , stimulant , mood stabilizer must 48 hr . interval without receive agent prior randomization , except patient recently ( within one dose interval ) treat depot antipsychotic , exclude trial . Patients treat prior antidepressant must 7 day washout period ( patient treat fluoxetine exclude trial long half-life ) . Medication study administer double-blind manner . Patients randomized quetiapine administer begin day 0 , dose 100mg/day titrate 300mg/day day 3 , flexible titration 600mg/day ( 100mg/day increment ) day 28 . Patients evaluate blinded ( treatment status adverse event ) rater baseline ( day 0 ) ( MPD ) , prior randomize placebo quetiapine . Ratings 1-4 do baseline ( day 0 ) day 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 , 49 , 56 ( termination study ) . Extrapyramidal rating scale adverse event assess day efficacy rating different rater rater perform rating scale . Adverse event evaluate open-ended question side effect vital sign measure . Adverse event monitor , document tabulated occurrence , frequency severity . Any extrapyramidal symptom develop patient appropriately treat via dose reduction and/or administration anticholinergic agent ( e.g . benztropine ) , record . Patients receive psychotropic agent study except lorazepam , need anxiety agitation , 4 mg/d day 0-6 , 2 mg/d day 7 14 , 1mg/day day 14-21 . The dos lorazepam administer patient record . Patients require psychotropic medication terminate point intervention require . Please see Table 1 schedule assessment laboratory test . Investigators responsible monitoring safety patient enter protocol alert AstraZeneca event seem unusual , even event may consider unanticipated benefit patient . Additionally , baseline medical history , physical examination , laboratory test , vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , weight , height temperature ) perform . Blood pressure pulse take patient lie 5 minute ( supine ) stand approximately 2 minute ( stand ) . Laboratory test include urine pregnancy test serum complete blood count ( CBC ) , liver function test ( LFTs ) , thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) , renal profile , prolactin level , fast glucose , fast lipid profile , EKG . Vital sign , include Body Mass Index ( BMI ) waist circumference repeat day 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 , 49 , 56 ( endpoint ) . All lab perform baseline ( day 0 ) day 56 ( termination study ) , exception fast plasma glucose , fast plasma lipid profile , complete blood count , also repeat day 28 ( day 0 56 ) . A funduscopic physical exam perform prior termination trial . If point study patient CDRS suicide item score &gt; one point high baseline one week , score &gt; 3 withdrawn study . Additionally , patient withdraw study ( treat clinically indicate ) worsen symptom day 14 later , indicate CGI-I score &gt; 6 time study minimal worsening symptom day 21 later indicate CGI-I score &gt; 5 2 consecutive visit , start day 14 . Additionally , point study patient CBC differential show Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &lt; 1.0 x 10-9/L , repeat test within 24 hour , remain &lt; 1.0 x 10-9/L , patient discontinue study . Patients discharge form hospital felt clinically stable determined inpatient attend treatment team collaboration Dr. DelBello .</detailed_description>
