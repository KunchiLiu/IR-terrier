	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) important chronic disease adult , affect estimate 4 % men 2 % woman United States . Nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) demonstrate ameliorate symptom neurobehavioral consequence OSAS . Unfortunately , patient adherence prescribe CPAP low , diminish benefit obtain expensive therapy . Nurse-administered patient education monitoring CPAP use home visit show effective significantly improve CPAP adherence . Given logistic complexity deliver service cost , unlikely disseminate widely clinical practice . An alternative , use advanced telecommunication technology deliver similar adherence improvement service , propose study . Objective ( ) : Use telecommunication system important health-related behavior medication-taking , diet , exercise demonstrate significant improvement therapy adherence . Methods : This research project represent randomize controlled trial Telephone-Linked Communications ( TLC ) system design improve CPAP adherence ( TLC-CPAP ) . The study enroll adult OSAS start nasal CPAP therapy . Subjects randomize TLC-CPAP attention placebo control group . The effect TLC CPAP use disease-specific quality life ( QOL ) , OSAS-related symptom , depression , vigilance 12-month interval assess . The intervention control group compare assess difference potential confounders include age , sex , OSAS severity , CPAP pressure level , comorbid illness , physician specialty status , BMI , socioeconomic status , marital status . Each outcome variable ( continuous variable ) compare intervention control group use multivariate analysis adjust potential confounders differ group . Multivariate model include appropriate test interaction . All analysis perform use intent-to-treat approach . Status : Completed Impact : This Telephone-Linked Communications ( TLC ) technology offer effective , low-cost , easy-to-use mean provide disease-specific education , monitoring , counsel improve adherence therapy .</detailed_description>
