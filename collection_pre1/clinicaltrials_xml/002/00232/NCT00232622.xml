	<brief_summary>The optimal dosage duration administration clot-dissolving medication treatment patient mechanical heart valves clot know . We hypothesize large dose clot-dissolving medicine give initially ( akin dose give treatment heart attack ) , might speed dissolution clot rapidly restore functioning mechanical heart valve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The optimal fibrinolytic strategy leave side prosthetic valve thrombosis ( PVT ) know . A large initial bolus dose streptokinase ( SK ) might accelerate fibrinolysis restore valve function rapidly . This prospective , randomized trial compare 2 fibrinolytic protocol first episode PVT . In rapid fibrinolytic protocol ( RFP ) 1.5 MU SK give 1 hour , follow require 0.1 MU/h infusion . In standard protocol ( SP ) 0.25 MU give 30 minute , follow infusion 0.1 MU/h . Serial echocardiography fluoroscopy do monitor therapy . The primary end point occurrence complete clinical response ( CCR , complete hemodynamic response without major complication ) . 58 patient require arm detecting 30 % difference 80 % power Î±=0.05 .</detailed_description>
