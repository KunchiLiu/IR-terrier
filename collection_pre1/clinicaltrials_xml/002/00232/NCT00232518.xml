	<brief_summary>There considerable debate last 30 year interaction asthma parasitic infection . It suggest least part reason increase prevalence asthma develop world decrease parasite infection result improved living condition economic development . Our previous study Ethiopia suggest hookworm infection may particularly important process . To establish definitively whether parasite protect allergic disease , specifically asthma , ultimately require randomised clinical trial parasite infection patient asthma . We , researcher University Nottingham , complete study normal volunteer establish dose hookworm necessary generate infection level show protective population survey , show infection well tolerate . We propose two randomise placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial . The first test effectiveness hookworm infection reduce symptom allergic patient rhinitis , also serve allow u check likely safety hookworm infection asthma . Assuming result study favourable , carry trial hookworm infection asthma . We also take opportunity study investigate cellular mechanism effect hookworm infection immune system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Clinical Trials Effect Therapeutic Hookworm Infection Allergic Rhinoconjunctivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological evidence suggest human hookworm infection associate reduce risk asthma allergic disease . This association potentially important understand aetiology asthma allergic disease , also suggest hookworm product might therapeutically effective condition . To test hypothesis hookworm protect asthma ultimately require clinical trial . We carry dose-ranging study establish dose hookworm larva necessary generate infection intensity show protective epidemiological study , acceptable side effect , propose test effect 12 week hookworm infection level intensity two randomise placebo control clinical trial . The first patient allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , determine whether hookworm infection improve rhinitis symptom also , patient measurable airway responsiveness , determine whether airway responsiveness change lung migration phase hookworm life cycle . If study confirm hookworm infection increase airway responsiveness , proceed similar trial patient asthma . In study also measure range relevant immunological parameter explore relation parameter expression allergic asthmatic phenotype .</detailed_description>
