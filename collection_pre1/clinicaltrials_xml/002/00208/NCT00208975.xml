	<brief_summary>Patients low-grade , indolent ( slow-growing ) form non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) usual survival 7-10 year ask take part study . Although normally-used combination chemotherapy cause NHL disappear 30-40 % patient ( call complete response complete remission ) , almost disease return . In study , researcher test combination anti-cancer agent , fludarabine , rituximab GM-CSF mitoxantrone cyclophosphamide see good long-lasting response achieve . All medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) available market . The agent use : - Mitoxantrone fludarabine cyclophosphamide fludarabine combination chemotherapy drug successfully use treat NHL/CLL ( Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ) return treatment comparable option treatment . - Rituximab , monoclonal antibody kill cancer cell bind CD20 antigen find surface B-cells , commonly use along chemotherapy drug improve response rate lymphoma treatment . - GM-CSF ( granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor , also call sargramostim , GM , Leukine ) , growth factor stimulate development new ( `` stem '' ) cell . GM-CSF encourage stem cell divide , specialize , become active . It normal part treatment NHL . Using GM-CSF NHL treatment experimental part study . The main purpose study see give GM-CSF along standard anti-cancer treatment work well reduce cancer , look side effect treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients low-grade , indolent ( slow-growing ) form non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) usual survival 7-10 year ask take part study . Although normally-used combination chemotherapy cause NHL disappear 30-40 % patient ( call complete response complete remission ) , almost disease return . When NHL diagnose , abundance white blood cell call B-lymphocytes ( B-cells ) find body . Almost B-cells special protein surface call CD20 antigen . Some anti-cancer drug , call monoclonal antibody , target cancer cell binding , `` locking '' , specific antigen find surface , kill cancer cell . In study , researcher test combination anti-cancer agent see good long-lasting response achieve . All medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) available market . The agent use : -Mitoxantrone fludarabine , combination chemotherapy drug successfully use treat NHL return treatment . OR - Cyclophosphamide fludarabine , combination chemotherapy drug successfully use treat NHL return treatment . - Rituximab , monoclonal antibody kill cancer cell bind CD20 antigen find surface B-cells , commonly use along chemotherapy drug improve response rate lymphoma treatment . - GM-CSF ( granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor , also call sargramostim , GM , Leukine ) , growth factor stimulate development new ( stem ) cell . GM-CSF encourage stem cell divide , specialize , become active . It normal part treatment NHL . Using GM-CSF NHL treatment experimental part study . In study do laboratory , GM-CSF cause increase number antigen , CD20 , surface B-cells . If antigens present , may easier target cell express CD20 antigen . Monoclonal antibody ( rituximab ) might able effectively bind antigen kill cancer cell . The main purpose study see give GM-CSF along standard anti-cancer treatment work well reduce cancer , look side effect treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To qualify study , patient must relapse , refractory previously untreated lowgrade ( indolent ) nonHodgkin lymphoma follow subtypes : Follicular center cell lymphoma grade 1 , lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma , small lymphocytic lymphoma , splenic marginalzone type lymphoma , monocytoid Bcell lymphoma extranodal mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma . Final eligibility determine health professional conduct clinical trial . Patients receive prior treatment purine analog exclude study . Also , patient whose diagnostic/histologic subtype confirm institution able participate study . Final eligibility determine health professional conduct clinical trial .</criteria>
