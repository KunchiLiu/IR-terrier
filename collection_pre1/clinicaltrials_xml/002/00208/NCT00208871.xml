	<brief_title>An Evaluation Stereoscopic Digital Mammography Earlier Detection Breast Cancer Reduced Rate Recall</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical trial , begin December , 2004 , conduct Emory University . Over next three year , enroll image 2000 woman elevate risk development breast cancer ( personal family history breast cancer ) come annual screening examination . Each participate patient image system , stereo standard ( non-stereo ) image read independently different mammographers . A stereoscopic digital mammogram consist two x-ray image breast acquire slightly different point view digital mammography unit . The x-ray source rotate 10-degrees two exposure position breast remain fixed compression device . The stereo pair mammogram view new third-generation , high-resolution stereo display workstation develop first part project . The mammographer view stereo display wear lightweight polarize glass , enable see depth internal structure within breast . As result , subtle lesion may obscure superimpose normal tissue standard 2D image , become visible overlie underlie normal tissue separate depth . Conversely , layer tissue may falsely resemble lesion standard 2D image due chance superimposition , see stereo mammogram lie different depth , thus , mistaken lesion . We anticipate stereo mammography mammographers detect subtle lesion stereo image miss non-stereo image . We also expect few false positive detection stereo image compare standard image . Finally , also expect mammographers confident judgment see stereo image , result reduce rate recall patient work-up .</detailed_description>
