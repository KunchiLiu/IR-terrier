	<brief_summary>There many child heart dysfunction either born Congenital Heart Disease ( CHD ) develop poor heart function heart ill . The invention medical technology help treatment child . New heart echocardiogram ( echo ) technique include Tissue Doppler ( TDI ) , Tissue Synchronization Imaging ( TSI ) 3 dimensional echocardiography ( 3D ) image technology hope help diagnosis treatment child . Tissue Doppler Imaging noninvasive technique measure speed heart muscle movement . Tissue Synchronization Imaging measure well low pump chamber heart work together . A 3D echo 3 dimensional picture beat heart allow doctor see heart angle . These technique noninvasive , mean outside body . The size function ventricle ( low part heart ) change different condition . Using technique attempt good determine well ventricle function illness health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Tissue Doppler/Synchronization Determine Heart Function Children With Congenital Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject treat Sibley Heart Center Children 's Healthcare Atlanta diagnosis congenital heart defect acquire heart condition ( i.e . heart failure ) may approach possible participation study . These patient include newly diagnose patient well patient diagnose previous year receive medical treatment defect condition . The following describe study procedure : Echocardiographic assessment Standard 2-dimensional , M-mode , Doppler 3-dimensional echocardiography evaluation perform . We assess cardiac function use leave ventricular shortening ( SF ) ejection fraction ( EF ) . The EF calculate use M-Mode Simpson 's rule . We also perform tissue synchronization imaging ( TSI ) tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) use GE Vivid 7 echocardiographic system . Both TSI TDI assist investigator assess mechanical synchrony . The research echocardiograms occur time routine assessment . Clinical assessment/data collection Clinical information chart collect study . The information include doctor 's evaluation general health , include diagnosis name medication participant may take . If child undergone routine MRI purpose clinical care , MRI measure collect order compare MRI image measure new 3D echo technique . Finally , EKG data collect visit . EKGs perform routinely patient however , one performed , study staff perform EKG assessment order electromechanical information ( i.e . arrhythmia ) child participate .</detailed_description>
