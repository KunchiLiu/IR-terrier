	<brief_title>A Clinical Double Blind , Randomized Study Efficacy Hyperuricemia Treatment With Anserine Product .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperuricemia common metabolic disorder . It result decreased renal uric acid excretion , increased urate production , . The classical association clinical gout well-known . The principal indication uric acid-lowering therapy , include allopurinol , probenecid sulfinpyrazone , patient gout history , macroscopic subcutaneous tophus , frequent attack gouty arthritis , document state uric acid overproduction . Hyperuricemia without gout attack indication treatment.However , hyperuricemia often associate cardiovascular disease risk factor obese , hyperlipidemia , glucose intolerance hypertension . It known symptom syndrome X ( also know multiple risk factor cluster syndrome ) . Diet control way control serum uric acid level , always enough . So management hyperuricemia important potential management.Histidine-containing dipeptides Anserine Carnosine study extensively recent year . These dipeptides show effective act buffer agent proton develop anaerobic exercise . Anserine Carnosine also strong anti-oxidant activity , anti-cancer activity , immuno-response modulation , fat reduction enhance wound heal function . The Yaizu Suisankagaku Industry Company develop industrial production process extract purify dipeptides Bonito Tuna . The extract , name Marine Active , able offer anti-fatigue activity animal trial data . Human clinical trial show reduced creatine phosphokinase activity sero-uric acid reduction activity also observe . So committed design clinical randomized , double blind study hyperuricemia management Marine Active . All effort hop find novel method manage hyperuricemia .</detailed_description>
