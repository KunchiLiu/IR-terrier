	<brief_title>Aripiprazole Children With Autism : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I . SPECIFIC AIM To obtain pilot data regard safety , dose , efficacy open-labeled aripiprazole child , age 12 18 year , diagnose autism . A large , control trial plan population drug safe tend efficacious . II . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Autism serious disorder first present childhood , usually three year age ( American Psychiatric Association , 1994 ) . Though incidence autism low ( approximately 3-6 case per 10,000 live birth ) , consequence disorder severe . As term `` pervasive '' implies , symptom affect area function develop child , disability associate disorder tend persist throughout life . Symptoms autism include abnormality social relatedness include extreme withdrawal ; communication include little speech ; sameness repetitiveness behavior interest . Children diagnose autism severe problem include hyperactivity , lability mood , irritability , withdrawal , stereotypical behavior . Because severe problem , treatment symptomatology often include pharmacotherapy . The studied drug treat child adolescent autism typical neuroleptic , haloperidol ( Anderson et al , 1989 ; Anderson et al , 1984 ; Campbell et al , 1978 ; Cohen et al , 1980 ) . The main public health concern regard use haloperidol risk induce dyskinesia ( Campbell et al , 1988 , 1997 ) , though dyskinesias reversible . Evidence also suggest atypical neuroleptic , olanzapine ( Horrigan et al , 1997b ; Malone et al , 2001 ; Potenza et al , 1999 ) risperidone ( Demb , 1996 ; Findling et al , 1997 ; Fisman Steele , 1996 ; Hardan et al , 1996 ; Horrigan et al , 1997a ; Malone et al , 1999b ; McDougle et al , 1997 ; Nicholson et al , 1998 ; Perry et al , 1997 ) effective . But weight gain associated agent considerable health risk ( Pi-Sunyer , 1993 ; Sjostrom , 1992 ) . For example , olanzapine use reportedly associate increased blood glucose ( Fertig et al , 1998 ; Gatta et al , 1999 ; Ober et al , 1999 ; Wirshing et al , 1998 ; Yazici et al , 1998 ) . Ziprasidone associate increase QTc , include child ( Malone , unpublished data ) . Aripiprazole , recently release atypical agent likely effective neuroleptic autism , may considerable health advantage cause weight gain . However , lack safety efficacy data aripiprazole child autism , open pilot study aripiprazole population indicate . III . DESIGN AND METHODS A . Setting : The setting study Specialty Clinic Pervasive Developmental Disorders , part Child Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic Drexel University College Medicine locate Friends Hospital . B . Subjects : Subjects 15 child adolescent meet DSM-IV Criteria Pervasive Developmental Disorder . C. Design : This 6-week pilot study employ open treatment aripiprazole . Subjects rat baseline thereafter assessed weekly . D. Medication : Subjects treat openly aripiprazole . Should untoward effect occur , dosage medication reduce medication discontinue , clinically appropriate . Subjects receive concomitant psychotropic medication study . Medication take concomitant food . Aripiprazole Dosing Strategy : Aripiprazole tablet ( 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 mg ) employ study . The dosage range aripiprazole 5 mg/day 30 mg/day . Every effort make reach maintain therapeutic dosage week four treatment phase . 1 . For subject weigh less 25 kg , start dosage 5 mg/every day . After 3 day , dosage increase 5 mg. By week 2 , subject increase 20 mg/day . Thereafter , dosage increase make 10 mg increment weekly . 2 . For subject weigh great 25 kg , start dosage 5 mg/day . After three day , dosage increase 10 mg/day . By week two , subject increase 20 mg/day . Thereafter , dosage increase make 10 mg increment weekly need . Note : Should 5 mg tablet available , dose schedule employ Â½ 10 mg tablet dosage increase make 10 mg increment . We start 5 mg dosage avert excessive sedation onset drug administration . F. Measures 1 . Primary efficacy measure : The Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ; Psychopharmacology Bulletin , 1985 ) . The efficacy treatment judge ability enhance global functioning , assessment particularly relative pilot study . The CGI consist three global scale measure severity illness , global improvement , drug effect , useful measure drug treatment effect population ( see Campbell Palij , 1985 ) . The PI another trained rater complete scale . Although member research team generally complete scale , additionally complete subject 's parent/caretaker . Having complete parent/caretaker take minute may result useful data . This measure complete weekly beginning baseline . 2 . Secondary efficacy measure : Children 's Psychiatric Rating Scale ( Psychopharmacology Bulletin , 1985 ) . The CPRS develop Psychopharmacology Branch NIMH rate childhood psychopathology . Each item rat `` 1 '' ( present ) `` 7 '' ( extremely severe ) . The first 28 item scale require verbal response part subject , make appropriate rating child adolescent Pervasive Developmental Disorder . Of 28 item , 14 particularly relevant autism ( see Campbell Palij , 1985 ) : ass symptom drug treatment indicate include hyperactivity , aggression , self-abusive behavior , temper tantrum , lability mood , irritability , social withdrawal , stereotypies . A composite sum 14 item , CPRS-14 , construct employed secondary outcome measure , procedure use number investigator ( Anderson et al , 1989 ; Campbell et al , 1986 , 1989 , 1993 ; Findling et al , 1997 ; Sanchez et al , 1996 ) . We analyze data use CPRS-14 ; ICC 0.8978 . In addition , 4 factor derive 14 item examine . They include : autism , anger/uncooperativeness , hyperactivity , speech deviance ( Overall Campbell , 1988 ) . This measure complete baseline end treatment . 3 . Safety measure : ( 1 ) A physical exam complete baseline . ( 2 ) Height , weight , blood pressure , pulse obtain record baseline visit study . ( 3 ) The following laboratory measure obtain baseline repeat end treatment phase : complete blood count differential , liver function , electrocardiogram . Serum prolactin obtain baseline end treatment phase . Any clinically appropriate test evaluation also complete whenever need . Untoward effect measure record visit employ follow measure : ( 1 ) Dosage Record Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale ( DOTES ) ; ( 2 ) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale ( TESS ) ; ( 3 ) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) ( Psychopharmacology Bulletin , 1985 ) ; ( 4 ) Neurologic Rating Scale ( Simpson Angus , 1970 ) . The DOTES TESS measure wide range possible untoward effect . The AIMS measure dyskinesia . The Neurologic Rating Scale measure form extrapyramidal effect occur neuroleptic dystonias , parkinsonian effect , akathisia . G. Procedures : All patient appropriate study parent/caretakers approach informed consent assent ( subject 14 year ) obtain . Subjects meet Inclusion Criteria , Exclusion Criteria , enter baseline period study . Baseline ( week 0 ) : Subjects rat baseline employ CGI CPRS . End Treatment ( week 6 ) : At end treatment period , subject rat employ CGI CPRS ( select item ) . In addition , subject rat CGI visit data last visit available subject terminate study prematurely . If know subject terminate study visit week 6 , subject rat CGI CPRS visit . All safety measure complete visit . Laboratory measure EKG obtain morning . H. Analysis : This pilot study whose purpose get initial safety efficacy data aripiprazole child autism . We perform ANOVA , repeat measure , CGI severity score , CPRS-14 CPRS factor . Similar analysis perform safety measure include weight , prolactin laboratory measure , EKG index .</detailed_description>
