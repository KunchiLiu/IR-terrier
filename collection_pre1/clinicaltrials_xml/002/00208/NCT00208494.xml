	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare performance artificial hip metal head metal socket artificial hip ceramic head articulate metal socket component . The success total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) base upon follow clinical radiographic criterion meet two-year evaluation : ( 1 ) patient 's clinical result measure use modify Harris Hip evaluation rating system , absence complication require surgical removal replacement component ; ( 2 ) radiographic finding study endpoint ( i.e. , two year follow-up ) . Clinical radiographic success two ( 2 ) year postoperative require study hip deem successful .</brief_summary>
