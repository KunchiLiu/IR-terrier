	<brief_summary>Netherton syndrome genetic condition result abnormal skin functioning . People condition often red scale skin ; sparse short hair ; problem absorption medicine chemical apply skin . If chemical absorb high level , may cause health problem . Elidel ( pimecrolimus ) new medicine available cream . It show help improve appearance skin patient another skin condition know atopic dermatitis , approve United States ( US ) Food Drug Administration use child mild moderate atopic dermatitis .

	<detailed_description>Patients Netherton syndrome , rare genodermatosis , manifest chronic , eczematous dermatitis erythema scale often recalcitrant conventional therapy emollient topical corticosteroid . These patient display alter epidermal barrier increase permeability topical agent therefore susceptible evaporative transepidermal water loss infection . Topical therapy calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus pimecrolimus demonstrate improve skin integrity quality life patient several chronic dermatosis , include atopic dermatitis . As result underlie skin barrier dysfunction , however , possibility significant systemic absorption resultant side effect concern agent use patient Netherton syndrome . Experience topical tacrolimus 0.1 % ointment patient Netherton syndrome demonstrate marked efficacy well significant systemic absorption drug patient population . Use topical pimecrolimus patient Netherton syndrome report date . Investigation extent systemic absorption side effect help define safety efficacy profile topical pimecrolimus patient Netherton syndrome .</detailed_description>
