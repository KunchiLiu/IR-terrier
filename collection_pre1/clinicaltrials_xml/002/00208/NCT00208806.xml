	<brief_summary>Pacemakers attach one one heart chamber . After watch pacemaker work time , doctor find pacemaker stimulate one chamber heart sometimes lead problem later . These problem may change size shape heart . The heart work well change happen . We need learn change prevent . There easy way . A new treatment call Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) associate biventricular pace two chamber heart stimulate simultaneously . Tissue Doppler Imaging , Tissue Synchronization Imaging 3 dimensional echocardiography new form technology look heart work . They similar move x-ray watch heart muscle move . The movement measure . Doctors check change happen time . This studied child kind new group patient . This technology noninvasive mean do outside body painless . The heart child grow fast . It important able know pacemaker problem dilate cardiomyopathy causing change heart might cause problem . We expect able use information learn study improve use pacemaker future avoid problem happen time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis H1 : Children DCM . Ventricular dyssynchrony see majority ( 50 % ) pediatric patient DCM . Specific aim , SA 1 : To describe change right leave ventricular function use Tissue Synchronization Imaging ( TSI ) , Tissue Doppler Imaging ( TDI ) , 3D echocardiography conventional echocardiogram parameter child dilate cardiomyopathy . Hypothesis H2 : In pediatric population , clinical sign symptom relate dilate cardiomyopathy improve use biventricular pacing . Specific aim , SA 2 : To quantitate effect biventricular pace therapy ventricular function child dilate cardiomyopathy use Tissue Synchronization Imaging ( TSI ) , Tissue Doppler Imaging ( TDI , 3D echocardiography conventional echocardiographic parameter . Research Design Methods Patient population The patient population include child ( newborn 18 year age ) treat dilate cardiomyopathy Children 's Healthcare Atlanta ( Egleston Campus ) . Patients receive pacemaker therapy medicinal therapy DCM include . For purpose study , dilate cardiomyopathy define ejection fraction ( EF ) &lt; 35 % leave ventricular ( LV ) dimension great 95 % age . Only patient normal heart anatomy repair congenital defect 4 chamber evaluate . Heart transplant patient patient travel Children 's Healthcare Atlanta Egleston follow-up exclude study . Two distinct patient group examine : Group 1 : Patients diagnosis dilate cardiomyopathy . We divide patient two subgroup : A : New onset DCM patient ( defined patient diagnose DCM within past 90 day ) B : Established DCM patient ( defined patient diagnose DCM 90 day ) Group 2 : Paced Patients : Patients secondary diagnosis dilate cardiomyopathy due chronic RV pacing evaluate Biventricular pacemaker implantation . This group also include patient DCM receive biventricular pacemaker within last two year . The propose study single center , prospective , pilot evaluation ventricular effect DCM effect Biventricular pacing treatment DCM pediatric patient . All patient enrol follow referral 1 ) implantation biventricular pacemaker treatment cardiomyopathy 2 ) research echocardiogram due diagnosis dilate cardiomyopathy without pacemaker therapy . Inclusion criterion child dilate cardiomyopathy child refer biventricular pacemaker implantation upgrade diagnosis dilate cardiomyopathy . All participant require sign inform consent prior procedure . We anticipate enrol 50 patient March 1 , 2005 February 28 , 2006 study : 25 patient Group 1 25 patient Group 2 . This give u confidence level 95 % confidence interval 4-6 . Procedures Echocardiographic assessment Standard 2-dimensional , M-mode , Doppler evaluation perform . We assess cardiac function use leave ventricular shortening ( SF ) ejection fraction ( EF measure Simpson 's Rule ) . We also perform tissue synchronization imaging ( TSI ) , tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) , 3D echocardiography use GE Vivid 7 HP echocardiographic system . These system assist investigator determine ventricular function synchrony . In , study participant receive echocardiographic assessment follow time point : Group 1 ( new onset establish DCM patient without pacemaker ) : A ) Outpatient diagnosis DCM ( pacemaker ) —one echo perform baseline/enrollment ; B ) Inpatient diagnosis DCM ( pacemaker ) —one echo perform within 24 hour admission hospital , 14 day admission discharge hospital ( whichever come first ) , 3 month 2 week discharge hospital . Group 2 ( DCM patient pacemaker ) : One echo perform baseline prior biventricular pacemaker implantation , 14 day admission discharge hospital ( whichever come first ) follow biventricular pacemaker implantation , 2 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month 2 week biventricular pacemaker implantation . Inter-observer variability echocardiographic assessment ( method data analysis ) perform Drs . Derek Fyfe Tracy Froehlich Non-invasive Cardiology . Clinical assessment Clinical evaluation , include collection concomitant medication administration , number hospitalization heart failure adverse event perform visit . An electrocardiogram ( EKG ) perform study visit assess QRS duration . Heart failure functional class also collect every visit use Ross NYHA classification .</detailed_description>
