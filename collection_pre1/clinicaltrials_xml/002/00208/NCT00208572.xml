	<brief_title>Treatment Citalopram Anxiety Disorders Following Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety occur commonly traumatic brain injury may influence cognitive , behavioral , somatic presentation may interfere patient ' recovery adaptation life brain injury . TBI involve diffuse brain injury well frequent focal injury frontal temporal structure , include hippocampus amygdala , area also implicate neurobiology anxiety . Although anecdotal report benefit SRIs treatment anxiety association TBI , unfortunately control trial establish SRI efficacy patient whose anxiety consider secondary brain injury . A randomized placebo control clinical trial design use investigate effectiveness citalopram patient anxiety disorder due general medical condition , specifically traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Beneficiaries 3 24 month post injury meet criterion DSM-IV diagnosis anxiety disorder due TBI recruit 7 DVBIC VA Military Medical Centers . Participants randomize receive increase dose citalopram placebo dose 40 mg citalopram 4 pill placebo 12-week treatment period . Patients receive comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation DVBIC site , include neurology , neuropsychology psychiatry interview evaluation baseline , 12 week 12 month . Participants sign inform consent prior administration research test scale . An informational script read individual see within protocol timeframe . This script provide necessary standardization presentation protocol potential participant . It also specify research coordinator individual present protocol , rather primary clinical care provider . After script read , individual give informed consent review . Patients eligible participate/consent participate study reach Rancho Los Amigos level 7 8 . If question patient 's capacity consent , neuropsychologist and/or psychiatrist involve study ass subject 's intellectual mental faculty prior consent . Any confusional state prohibits subject rat 7 8 . Additionally , experience , patient able undergo full evaluation Walter Reed DVBIC program reach level recovery . Therefore , anticipate almost patient evaluated program capacity give inform consent . After sign volunteer inform consent , test scale administer patient randomized receive 12-week course citalopram placebo . Female participant childbearing potential give serum pregnancy test ( 1 tablespoon ) prior randomize study medication . If result test positive , allow participate study . The study physician discus alternative treatment option . Patients receive increase dose citalopram placebo dose 40 mg citalopram 4 pill placebo . See Table 2 dose schedule . A blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn completion 12-week treatment period use obtain citalopram level measure medication compliance . A two-week taper follow treatment period . Patients receive comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation DVBIC site , include neuropsychological psychiatric interview evaluation baseline , 12 week 12 month . Because randomize , control trial exist suggest current medical treatment effective patient , substantial placebo effect know reality , design study ( citalopram vs. placebo ) appropriate . Patients commonly refer DVBIC mild-moderate mood anxiety symptom . We care several clinically anxious patient refuse medication . We work supportive educational framework , case , anxiety remit . Thus , best treatment patient far establish . It likely future research help clarify treatment best patient . All patient contact weekly ( person phone ) medication phase assess general condition , current symptom compliance . Female participant also ask possibility may pregnant . If chance , discontinue study medication ask return clinic serum pregnancy test . If result test positive , follow study staff remainder study . If result test negative , re-started study medication 1 pill 10 mg citalopram placebo per day . Patients rat improvement week 3 , 6 , 9 possible dosage adjustment . The determination medication adjustment make base upon score Clinical Global Improvement Scale give participant time point ( see Table 2 ) . Dosage adjustment consider clinician rate patient score 3 high scale ( Minimally Improved Very Much Worse ) . However , CGI Efficacy Index drug effect determine direction dosage adjustment . A side effect rat significantly interfere patient function outweigh therapeutic effect result one following course action : ( 1 ) addition concomitant medication , ( 2 ) decrease study agent dose , ( 3 ) discontinuation study agent . In word , patient score 3 high CGI Global Improvement Scale significant side effect CGI Efficacy Index study agent dose increase . Any patient experience significant side effect time treatment period consider dose decrease , discontinuation concomitant medication use . A decision regard proper course action dependent severity side effect , overall therapeutic effect patient input . Patients return study center end 12-week treatment period follow-up evaluation . After 12-week evaluation , patient taper citalopram placebo within 2 week . Tapering discontinuation study medication placebo do gradual basis ( e.g. , If patient 30 mg , s/he could take 20 mg 1 week , 10 mg one week , D/C ) . If , follow 12-week participation treatment protocol 1-2 week taper period , subject recurrent symptom distress believe need medication keep symptom recur evaluate clinically . Once participant complete 12- week treatment period , taper study agent . After taper complete , may treat therapy pharmacological intervention physician feel clinically indicate . Although collect data one year participants complete treatment phase , primary outcome measure collect end 12th week treatment period . We record concomitant medication use study medication use follow-up data analysis . Following 12-week treatment period taper , patient may offer appropriate treatment , include citalopram , medically indicate . All treatment drug record . The blind yet break , , patient able learn treat placebo citalopram .</detailed_description>
