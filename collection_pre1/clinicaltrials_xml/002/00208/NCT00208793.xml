	<detailed_description>There strong biologic plausibility animal experimental evidence protection colorectal cancer calcium vitamin D , calcium significantly reduce adenoma recurrence large clinical trial human ( yet previously report observational evidence , although generally supportive , inconsistent ) , observational literature strongly support protection vitamin D. A close physiological relationship calcium vitamin D long know . Yet , possible reduction colorectal epithelial cell proliferation calcium , effect calcium vitamin D , individually jointly , normal human colorectal epithelium remain unknown . There clinical trial involve vitamin D individually jointly calcium related colorectal cancer chemoprevention human . There currently generally accept pre-neoplastic biomarkers risk colorectal cancer possible exception proliferation marker , best , limited usefulness individual marker . Based recent advance understand molecular basis colorectal cancer , develop panel newer , plausible , reliable , immunohistochemically detected biomarkers provide molecular phenotyping normal appear colorectal epithelium : 1 ) inflammation ( COX-2 ) , 2 ) expression gene involve normal structure function colorectal epithelium find alter early two major colorectal carcinogenesis pathway ( APC , MSH2 , MLH1 ) , 3 ) complete picture cell cycle event colorectal epithelial crypt cell ( short long-term proliferation : MIB-1 telomerase ; differentiation : p21 ; apoptosis inhibition promotion : bcl-2 , bax , bak ) yet test chemoprevention trial . To address need , conduct preliminary , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 2 x 2 factorial chemoprevention trial ( n = 88 ) calcium 2,000 mg/day vitamin D3 800 IU/day , alone combination vs placebo 6 month patient recent removal sporadic adenomatous colorectal polyp , investigate effect individual component aggregate profile colorectal cancer risk biomarker panel . We also examine study result stratify NSAID use Bsm I vitamin D receptor genotype . The preliminary estimate treatment effect size variability use refine biomarker panel study design calculate need sample size potential full-scale study . We assert use biological measurement risk , ischemic heart disease , result decline colorectal cancer incidence mortality . The propose project borne vision , intertwined mission explore efficacy two plausible evidentially well-supported dietary agent , calcium vitamin D , modulation plausible panel molecular phenotypic biomarkers risk colorectal neoplasia .</detailed_description>
