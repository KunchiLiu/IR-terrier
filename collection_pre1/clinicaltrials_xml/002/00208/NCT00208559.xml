	<brief_title>Ziprasidone Children With Autism : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I . SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . To investigate safety clinical use ziprasidone child 2 . To investigate dosage employ clinically . II . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Ziprasidone , recently release atypical agent likely effective neuroleptic treat psychiatric symptom child , may considerable health advantage cause weight gain . Ziprasidone administration associate prolongation QTc interval ( mean=20 msec ) , electrocardiographic measure ventricular repolarization ( Federal Drug Administration , 2000 ) . There report regard use ziprasidone autism , data regard safety efficacy ziprasidone child extremely limited . The publish study ziprasidone child find safe effective treat Tourette 's syndrome child age 7 17 year age ( Sallee et al , 2000 ) . Because child treat ziprasidone despite paucity safety data , important begin collect review available data , include clinical usage . Some child receive service within Child Adolescent Psychiatric Services Drexel University College Medicine treat ziprasidone . The chart child adolescent contain data regard exposure ziprasidone laboratory data ECG 's review determine whether ziprasidone treatment associate change weight , laboratory value ECG 's . We propose review chart patient treat service since March 1 , 2001 XXX patient may expose ziprasidone ( ziprasidone receive FDA approval February 5 , 2001 ) . III . DESIGN AND METHODS A . Setting : The setting study Specialty Clinic Pervasive Developmental Disorders , part Child Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute . B . Subjects : Subjects 15 child adolescent meet DSM-IV Criteria Pervasive Developmental Disorder . C. Design : This 6-week pilot study employ open treatment ziprasidone . Subjects rat baseline thereafter assessed weekly . D. Medication : Subjects treat openly ziprasidone . Should untoward effect occur , dosage medication reduce medication discontinue , clinically appropriate . Subjects receive concomitant psychotropic medication study . Medication take concomitant food . Ziprasidone Dosing Strategy : Ziprasidone tablet ( 5 , 10 , 20 mg ) employ study . The dosage range ziprasidone 5 mg/day 40 mg/day . Every effort make reach maintain therapeutic dosage week four treatment phase . 1 . For subject weigh less 25 kg , start dosage 5 mg/every day . After 3 day , dosage increase 5 mg. By week 2 , subject increase 20 mg/day . Thereafter , dosage increase make 20 mg increment weekly . 2 . For subject weigh great 25 kg , start dosage 5 mg/day . After three day , dosage increase 10 mg/day . By week two , subject increase 20 mg/day . Thereafter , dosage increase make 20 mg increment weekly need . Note : Should 5 mg tablet available , dose schedule alter starting dosage 10 mg , dosage increase make 10 mg increment . F. Measures 1 . Primary efficacy measure : The Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ; Psychopharmacology Bulletin , 1985 ) . The efficacy treatment judge ability enhance global functioning , assessment particularly relative pilot study . The CGI consist three global scale measure severity illness , global improvement , drug effect , useful measure drug treatment effect population ( see Campbell Palij , 1985 ) . The PI another trained rater complete scale . Although member research team generally complete scale , additionally complete subject 's parent/caretaker . Having complete parent/caretaker take minute may result useful data . This measure complete weekly beginning baseline . 2 . Secondary efficacy measure : Children 's Psychiatric Rating Scale ( Psychopharmacology Bulletin , 1985 ) . The CPRS develop Psychopharmacology Branch NIMH rate childhood psychopathology . Each item rat `` 1 '' ( present ) `` 7 '' ( extremely severe ) . The first 28 item scale require verbal response part subject , make appropriate rating child adolescent Pervasive Developmental Disorder . Of 28 item , 14 particularly relevant autism ( see Campbell Palij , 1985 ) : ass symptom drug treatment indicate include hyperactivity , aggression , self-abusive behavior , temper tantrum , lability mood , irritability , social withdrawal , stereotypies . A composite sum 14 item , CPRS-14 , construct employed secondary outcome measure , procedure use number investigator ( Anderson et al , 1989 ; Campbell et al , 1986 , 1989 , 1993 ; Findling et al , 1997 ; Sanchez et al , 1996 ) . We analyze data use CPRS-14 ; ICC 0.8978 . In addition , 4 factor derive 14 item examine . They include : autism , anger/uncooperativeness , hyperactivity , speech deviance ( Overall Campbell , 1988 ) . This measure complete baseline end treatment . 3 . Safety measure : ( 1 ) A physical exam complete baseline . ( 2 ) Height , weight , blood pressure , pulse obtain record baseline visit study . ( 3 ) The following laboratory measure obtain baseline repeat end treatment phase : complete blood count differential , liver function , electrocardiogram . Serum prolactin obtain baseline end treatment phase . These laboratory study repeat end treatment phase study . Any clinically appropriate test evaluation also complete whenever need . Untoward effect measure record visit employ follow measure : ( 1 ) Dosage Record Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale ( DOTES ) ; ( 2 ) Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale ( TESS ) ; ( 3 ) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) ( Psychopharmacology Bulletin , 1985 ) ; ( 4 ) Neurologic Rating Scale ( Simpson Angus , 1970 ) . The DOTES TESS measure wide range possible untoward effect . The AIMS measure dyskinesia . The Neurologic Rating Scale measure form extrapyramidal effect occur neuroleptic dystonias , parkinsonian effect , akathisia . G. Procedures : All patient appropriate study parent/caretakers approach informed consent assent ( subject 14 year ) obtain . Subjects meet Inclusion Criteria , Exclusion Criteria , enter baseline period study . Baseline ( week 0 ) : Subjects rat baseline employ CGI CPRS . End Treatment ( week 6 ) : At end treatment period , subject rat employ CGI CPRS ( select item ) . In addition , subject rat CGI visit data last visit available subject terminate study prematurely . If know subject terminate study visit week 6 , subject rat CGI CPRS visit . All safety measure complete visit . Laboratory measure EKG obtain morning . I . Analysis : This pilot study whose purpose get initial safety efficacy data ziprasidone child autism . We perform ANOVA , repeat measure , CGI severity score , CPRS-14 CPRS factor . Similar analysis perform safety measure include weight , prolactin laboratory measure , EKG index .</detailed_description>
