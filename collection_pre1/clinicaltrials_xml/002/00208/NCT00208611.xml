	<brief_summary>Based Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) /vitamin B12 deficiency symptom overlap PD patient ' propensity avoid protein ( dietary source vitamin B12 ) , study proposes prospectively investigate vitamin B12 status PD patient time . In addition , study provide critical pilot data evaluate efficacy treat patient consider below-normal vitamin B12 level serum . Further , also explore concept supplement PD patient `` low-normal '' vitamin B12 level vitamin B12 improve either non-motor PD symptom homocysteine level PD patient receive levodopa . Study Hypotheses : 1 . Serum cobalamin ( B12 ) concentration patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) significantly low B12 concentration ) cohabit spousal caregiver control ; b ) population-based , age-matched control . 2 . Supplementation B12 levodopa-treated PD patient low ( &lt; 200 pg/ml ) low-normal ( 200-300 pg/ml ) serum B12 level associate significant improvement non-motor symptom reduces total plasma homocysteine concentration [ Hcy ] , know biomarker risk dementia cerebrovascular disease .</brief_summary>
