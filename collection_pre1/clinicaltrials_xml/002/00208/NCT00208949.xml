	<brief_summary>This study involve patient undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation . Both donor recipient seek study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Dendritic Cell Content T-Cell Phenotype Between Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) G-CSF + Granulocyte Macrophage ( GM ) -CSF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients leukemia receive stem cell transplant , prior receive medication and/or radiation destroy leukemia cell well blood cell . In order survive treatment , patient need give stem cell another person replace blood cell kill treatment . The stem cell give recipient collect relative . To increase number stem cell relative , he/she give growth factor increase number stem cell prior collection . The standard growth factor use call G-CSF ( Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor ) . In research study , physician give relative either G-CSF combination G-CSF GM-CSF ( Granulocyte Macrophage ( GM ) ) , another type growth factor . Whether relative receives G-CSF GM-CSF determine chance . The donor randomize one . It known stem cell white blood cell collect use one growth factor result cure disease few side effect , graft-versus-host disease . The reason study determine stem cell white blood cell collect different different growth factor give , see well patient . The stem cell transplant every way . The difference recipient donor decide study , donor either give G-CSF combination G-CSF GM-CSF recipient receive stem cell collect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All normal donor patient undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) hematologic disease invited participate research trial . All patient must meet criteria transplantation . Final eligibility determine health professional conduct clinical trial . Donors patient undergo select manipulated PBSC graft eligible . Donors pregnant lactate females donor know hypersensitivity either GCSF GMCSF exclude study . Final eligibility determine health professional conduct clinical trial .</criteria>
