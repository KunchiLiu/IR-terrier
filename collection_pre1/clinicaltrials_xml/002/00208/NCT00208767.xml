	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis 'hardening artery ' process ultimately lead development heart attack , stroke , poor circulation , death . Millions Americans affect progressive disease artery . Researchers try understand complex process lead harden artery . Part research taught investigator specific molecule cause damage injury vessel wall increase oxidation inflammation , turn , lead atherosclerosis . Other molecule cell find actually repair vessel wall . Currently , best treatment investigator prevent slow atherosclerosis control patient ' risk factor high blood pressure , diabetes , cholesterol level use prevention specific drug . Angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) class drug show clinical trial many beneficial effect patient high blood pressure , advanced heart disease ( heart attack heart failure ) , diabetes . However , whether drug also useful people early sign harden artery , measure thicken carotid ( neck ) arteries unknown , purpose study . The EFFERVESCENT trial design evaluate effect specific ARB , call valsartan , atherosclerosis . The investigator want know treatment valsartan increase blood level marker responsible repair vessel wall , reduce oxidation inflammation , improve function blood vessel , arrest slow progression atherosclerosis time . In study , investigator recruit subject harden thicken carotid artery , one main blood vessel neck . People screen ultrasound sonar examination . Two-thirds eligible participation receive valsartan remain one-third receive placebo pill . The investigator subject unaware drug give end study . The study last 2 year . Half individual also treat statin drug ( use cholesterol reduction ) remain individual statin . The investigator measure carotid artery thicken magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ; forearm blood vessel function use ultrasound ; perform blood test measure oxidation inflammation blood stream circulation stem cell responsible healing . These test repeat 3 month , 1 year 2 year start treatment . The investigator also collect blood genotyping DNA store future analysis study whether subject ' genotype alters susceptibility treatment . The investigator ' hypothesis ARB treat individual le oxidation inflammation , high level stem cell , slow progression arterial thickening . Finding early treatment atherosclerosis would hopefully prevent future stroke , heart attack , death lead improved longevity reduce medical expenditure .</detailed_description>
