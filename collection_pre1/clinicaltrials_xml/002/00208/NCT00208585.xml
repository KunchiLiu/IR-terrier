	<brief_title>Sertraline v . Placebo Symptoms Following Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective protocol follow : 1 . To investigate efficacy sertraline , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , treat neurobehavioral sequela irritability , depression , frustration , anxiety post-concussive symptom follow traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . 2 . To explore possible relationship anosmia ( deficit smell ) irritability/ aggression . This study test hypothesis : Sertraline effective treat Post TBI neurobehavioral symptom irritability , depression , frustration , anxiety , element postconcussive syndrome . Patients receive sertraline significantly less post-concussive symptom 12 week patient receive placebo . Post-concussive symptom measure Gouvier Post-Concussive Syndrome Scale ( PCSC ) Affective Cluster score Cicerone Post Concussive Scale . Patients anosmia great irritability aggressive symptom without anosmia . . Subjects : One hundred people take part study : approximately 50 subject take sertraline 50 take placebo . These patient select referral Defense Veterans Head Injury Program WRAMC . Patients active duty military beneficiary , 18 65 year age . Males non-pregnant female may participate . b . Inclusion Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Inclusion : 1 . Traumatic brain injury patient within 6 month injury . 2 . Traumatic brain injury : Minimum severity - TBI post traumatic amnesia . Maximum severity - recovery Rancho los Amigos ( see Appendix II ) level 7 8 six month injury . 3 . The C Criterion DSM IV diagnosis Post Concussive Disorder ( PCD- Research Criteria ) , symptom persist minimum 4 week . 4 . Military beneficiary . 2 . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Severe prior neurologic psychiatric illness , stroke psychosis . ( Previous nonpsychotic depression exclusion criterion ) 2 . Contraindication use sertraline . 3 . Previous severe traumatic brain injury ( defined TBI period unconsciousness great 1 week prior . This exclusion refer TBI 's prior current injury , within past 6 month ) . 4 . Pregnancy 5 . Current active suicidal ideation c. Study Design : This study prospective , double-blind , randomized 1:1 control trial study two group : active drug placebo . Block randomization use neither patient study physician able guess study drug assignment . d. Methodology : Patients receive multidisciplinary evaluation consist neurology exam , neuropsychology , psychiatry , speech language , psychosocial , rehabilitation medicine ( FIM/FAM ) , EEG , MRI , phlebotomy , family interview . Blood sample keep DVHIP label patient 's study number possible future use study well understand recovery head injury . No study would perform blood sample patient sign additional informed consent additional detail blood study plan . After sign volunteer inform consent current sertraline protocol , evoke potential smell test ( see Appendix III ) administer patient randomized active drug placebo group . Patients receive increase dose sertraline placebo dose 200 mg sertraline . See Table I , Appendix I , dose schedule . All patient receive two part counsel session regard brain injury recovery brain injury . The first session cover type symptom may experience brain injury , expect course recovery , recommendation symptom management . The second begin brief assessment material retain first counseling session , continue specific recommendation match general principle patient 's specific life situation . A brief pre-test post-test ( see Appendix IV ) general TBI information give first counsel session ; pre-test administer prior second session . These test permit good understand much information patient regard TBI much retain first counseling session . The medication phase last 12 week . Patients receive standard TBI care period . Current standard care patient moderate-severe TBI follow full evaluation medical/surgical treatment acute medical/surgical condition approximately 8 week Convalescent Leave Home ( CVL ) follow gradual return duty . Mild TBI patient typically receive 1-4 week CVL follow gradual return duty . Civilians would similar schedule resumption activity . From current referral pattern , expect patient moderate traumatic brain injury . The DVHIP experience suggest patient virtually never refer DVHIP severely depress already therapeutic level antidepressant . More commonly , patient refer mild-moderate symptom sleep difficulty , headache , irritability and/or depression . Because randomize , control trial exist suggest current medical treatment effective patient , substantial placebo effect know reality , design study ( randomization sertraline placebo ) appropriate . Also , care patient , although clinically depress , refuse medication . We work supportive educational framework , case , depression remit . Thus , best treatment patient far establish . It likely future research help clarify treatment best patient . For study , patient may start tricyclic antidepressant ( e.g. , headache ) SSRI withdrawn medication 10 day prior start study medication . Patients informed concomitant medication option test article ( sertraline placebo ) sufficient treat symptom , feel need medication prior start test article . All patient contact weekly medication phase assess general condition , current symptom , assessment compliance . Patients rat improvement week 3 , 6 , 9 possible medication adjustment . The determination medication adjustment make study personnel Walter Reed . If patient require clinical medical appointment 12 week , patient see WRAMC possible . If possible , study personnel available speak patient 's clinician local medical facility . Patients return WRAMC 12 week follow-up evaluation symptom , contact phone unable return WRAMC 12 week evaluation . After 12 week evaluation , patient taper sertraline placebo 2 week . Tapering discontinuation study medication placebo do gradual basis 2 week ( e.g. , If patient 150 mg , s/he could take 100 mg 1 week , 50 mg one week , D/C ) . If , follow 12 week evaluation , subject recurrent symptom distress , believe need medication keep symptom recur , pharmacologic nonpharmacologic treatment discuss . Patients offer appropriate treatment , include sertraline , medically indicate . The blind yet break , , patient able learn treat placebo sertraline . Subjects contact phone see 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month follow 12 week follow-up evaluation assessment symptoms general level functioning . If patient area , follow-up evaluation may do person . Concomitant medication : Patients difficulty sleep instruct sleep hygiene , interview possible deterrent sleep induction , encourage permit test medication time begin depression felt contribute sleep disturbance . If difficulty initiate maintain sleep persist , Ambien 5-10 mg po qd ( non-serotoninergic hypnotic ) offer . Benadryl 25-50 mg may also consider sleep induction . If clinically indicate , medication may prescribe . Patients headache counsel precipitant attempt maximize non-pharmacologic management headache . If pain persists , enteric-coated ASA prescribed . For patient non-responsive ASA ( headache pain syndrome ) , non-steroidal antiinflammatory medication permit . For vascular headache , Midrin sumatriptin may use . If clinically indicate , medication may prescribe . If patient severe depression respond test article/placebo , treat physician deems antidepressant medication necessary , non-SSRI medication , nortriptyline , use first line medication . Nortriptyline show effective post stroke depression ( 18 ) , may monitor plasma level , thus good medication combine either placebo sertraline . If nortriptyline effective ( nortriptyline appropriate particular patient ) , treat physician chose whatever antidepressant clinically indicate . Appropriate clinical care patient first priority . Pregnant woman may participate study . Women childbearing age take urine blood pregnancy test start study confirm pregnant . As part inform consent , woman advise avoid pregnancy least 6 week receive drug treatment advise reliable method birth control . Breast-feeding woman also exclude .</detailed_description>
