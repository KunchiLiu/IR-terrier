	<brief_summary>There many child bear Congenital Heart Disease . Many child undergo surgical procedure correct problem . Some patient must eventually get new heart . Once get new heart , way determine well new heart inside body . Tissue Doppler Imaging one way . Tissue Doppler Imaging like ultrasound . It take picture heart . In addition Tissue Doppler Imaging , new non-invasive procedure call Tissue Synchronization Imaging allow u see well new heart work well . In study would use technique determine well new heart working .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Doppler Echo Imaging Heart Function After Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart transplantation hope child end stage heart disease . Eventually cardiac deterioration occur lead death re-transplantation . Our understanding pathophysiology cardiac dysfunction child incomplete . The time course dysfunction process either RV and/or LV , systole diastole never study child . No meaningful TSI quantitation ever perform large pediatric OHT patient population . The long-term goal study detection functional myocardial change associate known stage post heart transplantation use TDI TSI . These achievement impact survival quality life child cardiac transplantation . Research Design Methods All subject treat transplant clinic approach possible participation study . These patient include newly transplant ( OHT ) patient well patient underwent OHT prior enrollment year . The following procedure occur study visit : Echocardiographic assessment Standard 2-dimensional , M-mode , Doppler 3-dimensional echocardiography evaluation perform . We assess cardiac function use leave ventricular shortening ( SF ) ejection fraction ( EF ) . The EF calculate use M-Mode Simpson 's rule . We also perform tissue synchronization imaging ( TSI ) tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) use GE Vivid 7 echocardiographic system . Both TSI TDI assist investigator assess mechanical synchrony . In newly transplant patient , echocardiographic assessment occur first 5 day serially measure ventricular synchrony acute post-operative period . For old transplant patient new transplant patient great five day transplantation , echocardiographic study occur follow-up clinic visit determine physician preference . Clinical assessment Clinical evaluation perform follow-up visit order track unrecognized complication adverse event . As standard , patient undergoing transplantation follow-up electrocardiogram ( EKG ) perform assess rhythm .</detailed_description>
