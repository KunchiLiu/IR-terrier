	<brief_summary>Tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) cofactor nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase enzyme , insufficiency result uncoupling enzyme , lead release superoxide rather NO disease state , include hypertension . We hypothesize oral BH4 reduce arterial blood pressure ( BP ) improve endothelial function hypertensive subject . Oral BH4 give subject poorly control hypertension ( BP &gt; 135/85 mm Hg ) weekly measurement BP endothelial function make . In Study 1 , 5 10 mg kg−1 day−1 BH4 ( n=8 ) administer orally 8 week , Study 2 , 200 400 mg BH4 ( n=16 ) give divide dos 4 week</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Problem Interest : Blood vessel line single layer cell call endothelium . These cell actively release substance influence variety function include blood flow artery . Nitric oxide ( NO ) among important substance . Decrease NO reduce blood vessel size increase blood pressure ( BP ) . Subjects hypertension ( high blood pressure ) strong family history hypertension without high blood pressure also exhibit endothelial dysfunction decrease NO activity . This abnormality predispose individual high blood pressure increase long term risk adverse cardiovascular event heart attack stroke . NO produced cell reaction mediate enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) . Experimental study perform Emory University show tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) , naturally produce substance , essential factor eNOS normally active , event BH4 deficiency , eNOS switch produce NO generate oxygen free radical increase oxidant stress blood vessel lead vascular damage . Moreover , study show administration BH4 animal hypertension decrease blood pressure . A recently complete study perform researcher Emory University show BH4 pill give twice day 8 patient poorly control high blood pressure eight week improve endothelial function decrease blood pressure without significant side effect . After stop BH4 , blood pressure endothelial function return baseline . Hypertension also link diastolic heart failure , condition squeeze heart normal relaxes abnormally cause shortness breath , edema fatigue . Up one half case heart failure cause diastolic heart failure . Recent evidence show line cell heart also produce NO promotes relaxation heart . In addition , study Emory show animal high blood pressure , NO production heart reduce compare normal . How problem study : The study consist three part : We , researcher Emory University , recruit patient hypertension randomize various dos BH4 find low dose produce significant response This dose use patient hypertension randomize BH4 placebo . Patients follow blood pressure response marker endothelial function use ultrasound marker inflammation use blood sample . Patients part 2 evidence abnormal heart relaxation echocardiogram repeat echocardiogram drug administration study effect BH4 heart relaxation . Advancement Scientific Knowledge This study advance scientific knowledge look effect BH4 , naturally occur substance without known major side effect , blood pressure . We also examine effect BH4 NO relaxation heart muscle . Improvement blood pressure BH4 allow option treatment high blood pressure potentially reduce complication associate condition . Standard care : Currently standard care patient high blood pressure include treatment Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve medication beta-blockers , angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , diuretic calcium-channel blocker goal BP le 135/85 .</detailed_description>
