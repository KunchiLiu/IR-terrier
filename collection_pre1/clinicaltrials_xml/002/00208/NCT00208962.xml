	<detailed_description>This research study involve treatment leukemia lymphoma ( lymph gland cancer ) adult leukemia lymphoma unlikely cure regular anticancer drug radiation treatment . Intensive treatment high dos chemotherapy follow bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) HLA- ( tissue-type ) match related donor would provide best chance cure leukemia lymphoma . However , success BMT relative limit patient old 50 year and/or organ dysfunction substantial complication due high dose chemotherapy related toxicity , graft-versus- host disease ( GVHD ) , relapse . Patients eligible study HLA match sibling , BMT sibling would carry high risk severe side effect due patient 's age , and/or organ dysfunction . Researchers evaluate new treatment adult patient leukemia lymphoma involve regular dose chemotherapy blood stem cell transplantation HLA-matched relative , injection donor immune cell ( type white blood cell ) give later relapse . In study , safety feasibility treatment strategy investigate .</detailed_description>
