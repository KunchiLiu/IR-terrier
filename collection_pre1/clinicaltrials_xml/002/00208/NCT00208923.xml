	<brief_title>Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation With Matched Unrelated Donors Patients With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cancer bone marrow ( leukemia ) lymph gland ( lymphoma ) ask take part study . This study use new chemotherapy regimen match volunteer stem cell transplant treat patient cancer kind . High dose chemotherapy , follow transplant stem cell collect either bone marrow ( BMT ) peripheral blood HLA ( tissue type ) match unrelated donor , offer potential cure several serious blood disease include acute chronic leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome lymphoma . However , success allogeneic ( unrelated volunteer match donor ) transplant limit treatment related illness , death , relapse patient refractory ( resistant ) disease and/or advance age ( old 40 year ) . Patients seek study HLA-matched relative donate stem cell ; however , The National Marrow Donor Program International Registries , HLA-matched unrelated donor find donate stem cell . Preliminary data show outcome comparable bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplantation , donor preference determine type cell patient receives . To carry unrelated transplant , normal person similar HLA type must available donate cell . The patient must prepare accept donor cell decrease body 's immune system . In addition , malignant ( cancerous ) cell must destroy allow growth repopulation healthy donor cell . This usually do give total body irradiation chemotherapy , associate severe side effect patient age 40 . In study , find treat patient two anticancer drug , Busulfan Cyclophosphamide , without total body irradiation , safe sufficiently immunosuppressive . High dose Busulfan Cyclophosphamide frequently use combination prior match related bone marrow transplant case acute leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) , chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . Fludarabine ( another anticancer drug ) suppress immune system strong anticancer effect chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) . Researchers study new chemotherapy regimen include fludarabine , along busulfan cyclophosphamide , provide immunosuppression anti-cancer effect without increase chemotherapy relate toxicity patient CML , acute leukemia MDS , CLL , NHL , HD . The purpose study : 1 ) decrease side effect due chemotherapy use treat bone marrow ; 2 ) increase number tumor cell kill . There 55 patient enrol study Emory University . The expected duration subject 's participation study two year .</detailed_description>
