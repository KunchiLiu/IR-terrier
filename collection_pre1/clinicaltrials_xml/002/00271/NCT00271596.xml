	<brief_summary>This research plan propose conduct double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial 36 adult mild Huntington 's disease ( HD ) address follow research aim : 1 . To determine effect citalopram compare placebo patient early HD executive function outcome variable include functional measure ( health-related quality life , work productivity , self-reported attention ) , motor performance , psychiatric status , 2 . To study relationship executive function functional status patient early HD selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) treatment , 3 . To examine effect citalopram treatment volumetric metabolic ( i.e , N-acetyl-aspartate concentration ) measure neostriatum among patient recently diagnose Huntington 's disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : 1 . To examine effect sixteen week treatment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) citalopram compare placebo executive function patient early Huntington 's disease ( HD ) . 2 . To study relationship executive function functional status patient early HD SSRI treatment . 3 . To determine effect sixteen week citalopram compare placebo outcome variable include functional measure ( health-related quality life , work productivity , self-reported attention ) , motor performance , psychiatric status . 4 . To examine effect citalopram treatment volumetric metabolic ( i.e , N-Acetyl-Aspartate concentration ) measure neostriatum among patient recently diagnose Huntington 's Disease . Main Hypotheses : 1 . At end treatment protocol , patient receive citalopram compare placebo show significantly great improvement test executive function . 2 . Performance measure executive function significantly associate measure functional status . 3 . At end treatment protocol , patient receive citalopram compare placebo show significantly great improvement functional status psychiatric rating ; motor score expect change result citalopram therapy . 4 . Using structural MRI occipital proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) , treatment , patient recently diagnose Huntington 's Disease show great change baseline volumetric metabolic ( i.e. , N-Acetyl-Aspartate concentration ) neuroimaging measure neostriatum placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Gene positive HD test ( , untested , HD diagnosis ) abnormal motor sign ( i.e. , diagnostic confidence level great equal 1 measure UHDRS ) . Aged 18 75 Ability provide write informed consent Mild stage HD ( Shoulson Fahn Scale Stage 1 2 ) Mild executive dysfunction : Participants must complaints poor cognition , mild functional decline , demonstrate objective evidence decline premorbid level Participants able complete study assessment Age 18 great 75 Current major depression deem significant investigator screen visit current suicidal ideation . Any unstable severe psychiatric disease include diagnosis schizophrenia , bipolar affective disorder , dementia , delirium , severe anxiety and/or substance abuse/dependence . Current use SSRI treatment depression ( e.g. , use MAOI ) treatment SSRI within past 14 day . Current use St. John 's wort within past 14 day . To ensure performance cognitive measure affect specific concomitant medication , participant take methylphenidate , amphetamine/dextroamphetamine , atomoxetine , acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor , atypical antipsychotic , kava kava , Ginkgo Biloba , anxiolytic drug may exclude unless dose dose frequency remain stable 30 day prior receive study drug . Continued participation also require dose dose frequency remain stable throughout study . Patients pregnant , nursing , plan become pregnant study . Patients unable participate study assessment ( cognitive , functional , psychiatric motor scale ) due cognitive , motor , sensory impairment ( i.e. , significant vision hear deficit ) . Other serious medical condition cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease ; head injury deem clinically significant PI ; neurological disorder insult HD . Learning disability medical condition likely affect cognitive function ; history symptom indicative attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) childhood ; diagnosis ADHD . It important note participant unable receive MRI scan may still participate study</criteria>
