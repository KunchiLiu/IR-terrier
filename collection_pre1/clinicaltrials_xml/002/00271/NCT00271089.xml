	<brief_summary>Fanconi anemia ( FA ) disease affect individual 's bone marrow . It cause defective gene CD34+ cell , responsible produce various type blood cell . Individuals FA may experience fatigue , bleeding , increase infection . The purpose study collect purify blood cell individual FA store future therapeutic use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Cell Collection Future Use Individuals With Fanconi Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FA rare , inherited disease cause gene defect CD34+ cell . It primarily affect individual 's bone marrow , result decrease production blood cell . The lack white blood cell affect individual 's ability fight infection , lack platelet may result bleeding , lack red blood cell usually lead anemia . FA typically diagnose childhood , high fatality rate . This study use two method collect , purify , store participant 's CD34+ cell future use case severe bone marrow failure . The collected cell also use researcher well understand cause FA possibly develop new treatment . This study enroll individual FA . All participant undergo bone marrow biopsy within 3 month study entry . Based result biopsy , participant undergo either bone marrow harvest procedure cytokine mobilize peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) collection procedure . Prior procedure , medical history review , blood drawn , liver kidney function evaluate , physical examination perform . Participants undergo bone marrow harvest procedure admit hospital , possible overnight stay observation . The following day , participant physical examination blood draw laboratory test . A blood and/or platelet transfusion may require following procedure . Participants undergo PBSC procedure require receive injection G-CSF , protein find normally body , twice day 4 8 day prior procedure ; G-CSF find help increase amount CD34+ cell blood . Once CD34+ level within certain range , PBSC procedure begin IV place arm temporary collection catheter place participant ' collarbone . Blood cell collect , cell separate remainder cell infuse back participant . The length procedure vary participant ; take 3 6 hour day , 1 4 day . Participants may require blood and/or platelet transfusion prior procedure . Following bone marrow harvest PBSC procedure , CD34+ cell isolated laboratory . The majority cell frozen store future use participant . A small portion cell available researcher perform experimental research well understand FA . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
