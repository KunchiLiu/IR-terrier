	<brief_summary>The objective study assess safety treatment Duragesic® ( transdermal patch deliver narcotic pain-reliever fentanyl ) dose 12.5 , 25 , 50 , 75 100 micrograms/hour pediatric subject require narcotic pain relief therapy . Particular attention pay appropriate dose conversion Duragesic® therapy subject 's current narcotic pain relief therapy , parameter increase Duragesic® dose achieve analgesic effectiveness . Pharmacokinetics ( fentanyl level bloodstream treatment ) also assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety , Dose Conversion , Dose Individualization Duragesic® ( Fentanyl Transdermal Patch ) Treatment Children With Chronic Pain Requiring Narcotic Pain Relief Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter trial design enroll total approximately 200 pediatric subject moderate severe chronic pain due malignant nonmalignant disease . Subjects must receive opioids continuously minimum 7 day prior enrollment project need continuous opioids least length primary treatment period . Subjects must also receive equivalent least 30 mg oral morphine day prior enrollment . Subjects enrol 3 age cohort include 2 &lt; 6 year , 6 &lt; 12 year , 12 &lt; 16 year . The study consist 15-day primary treatment period . After 15-day primary treatment period , subject may , investigator 's discretion , continue long-term treatment Duragesic® long medically appropriate . The objective study provide evaluation safety Duragesic® pediatric subject require treatment potent opioid management chronic pain . On Day 1 , subject convert oral parenteral opioids Duragesic® calculate previous 24-hour opioid analgesic requirement . This amount convert equi-analgesic oral morphine dose , use determine correspond Duragesic® dose . Short-acting oral parenteral opioids use rescue medication time study treat breakthrough pain ( pain adequately control Duragesic® ) . Following initiation Duragesic® treatment use recommend dose , subject titrate upwards ( frequently every 3 day initial dose ) analgesic effectiveness attain . Titration base supplemental opioid consumption , dose Duragesic® increase 12.5 micrograms/hour every 45 mg oral morphine consume 2nd 3rd day follow last patch change , maximum increase 25 micrograms/hour one time . The primary endpoint trial determination safety profile Duragesic® define target population . Safety assess monitor adverse event , vital sign measurement , physical examination . In addition , respiratory rate level sedation closely monitor first 72 hour . The assessment clinical utility include parent 's global assessment pain control Days 1 16 , pain level assess parent patient twice daily , morning evening ( assessed parent patient young age 6 ) , pain level time rescue medication give one hour afterwards , child 's play performance , quality-of-life child health questionnaire ( CHQ ) use measure physical , psychosocial functioning well child 5 year age . During primary treatment period , serum fentanyl concentration also measure . Sparse pharmacokinetic sampling incorporate trial design facilitate population pharmacokinetic analysis .</detailed_description>
