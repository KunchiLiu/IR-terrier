	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop score system allow doctor accurately identify child mechanical ventilator bacterial pneumonia . Currently diagnosis difficult make , result overuse antibiotic promotion antibiotic-resistant bacteria pediatric intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Four ICUs 3 child 's hospital participate . Study participant include 150 child , age 2 month 17 year old require mechanical ventilation , bedside health care provider suspect bacterial pneumonia . Bacteria study sample lung fluid breathe tube le 12 hour start antibiotic , use procedure know `` non-bronchoscopic-bronchoalveolar lavage ( NB-BAL ) . '' Participants may involve study related procedure 31 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective prospective cohort study derive clinical score predict absence bacterial pulmonary infection child require mechanical ventilation . This study preparation design interventional trial whose aim reduce antibiotic use pediatric intensive care unit ( ICU ) thereby reduce incidence acquisition antibiotic resistant bacteria . Secondary study objective : define key characteristic bacterial pulmonary infection child require mechanical ventilation : demographic , microbiology , predispose factor ; ass duration number antibiotic use treatment pneumonia study population ass amount antimicrobial therapy could potentially avoided patient low probability bacterial pneumonia determine score system . The study hypothesis non-invasive clinical scoring system devise bacterial pulmonary infection child require mechanical ventilation , identify threshold score probability bacterial pulmonary infection sufficiently low clinician safely withhold stop antibiotic . The primary outcome ( bacterial pneumonia ) define meet follow 2 criterion : presence great 10,000 organisms/mL one pathogenic bacterial specie obtain blind non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage ( NB-BAL ) Day 0 isolation pathogenic organism pleural fluid culture obtain Day -1 Day 3 , patient pulmonary infiltrate ; persistence Day 0 pulmonary infiltrate Day 3 base comparison result chest x-rays Days 0 3 . The secondary endpoint duration number antibiotic use , treatment pneumonia study population separately subgroup define threshold score bacterial pneumonia . Potential predictive parameter bacterial pulmonary infection calculate initiation antibiotic 3 day later . These parameter include factor Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score ( CPIS ) develop adult patient . Additional potential predictor bacterial pulmonary infection may relevant child also record add model attempt improve predictive accuracy . Study outcome microbiologically define bacterial infection , use quantitative low respiratory tract specimen collect blind NB-BAL entry persistence infiltrate chest x-ray Day 3 . The study population include child , age great 48 week post-conception le 18 year , require mechanical ventilation pediatric ICU , presence abnormal chest x-ray , initiation antibiotic less equal 12 hour prior NB-BAL assign health care provider suspect bacterial pulmonary infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Parent legal guardian sign informed consent . Age great 48 week postconception le 18 year age . Requiring mechanical ventilation intensive care unit ( subject intubate solely purpose study ) . Presence abnormal chest xray ( CXR ) determine primary care team ( Note : attending radiologist disagree read `` abnormal CXR , '' subject follow safety replace analysis ) . Initiation antibiotic assign health care provider suspect bacterial pneumonia ( must less equal 12 hour prior undergo nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage [ NBBAL ] ) . Presence severe hypoxia ( PaO2/FIO2 &lt; 120 ) . Documented suspect increased intracranial pressure . Hemodynamic instability , define one follow 4 hour precede study entry : 1 . Initiation inotropic vasopressor agent dose improve blood pressure tissue perfusion . 2 . Increase infusion rate inotropic vasopressor agent improve blood pressure tissue perfusion . Receipt intravenous ( IV ) oral ( PO ) antibiotic suspect bacterial pneumonia great equal 12 hour prior nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage ( NBBAL ) . Treatment previous episode suspect bacterial pneumonia within three day prior NBBAL . Coagulopathy : 1 . Documented platelet count &lt; 50,000 x 10^6/mL time enrollment ( Exception : The subject may enrol he/she receive platelet infusion part routine care complete within one hour NBBAL initiation ) , 2 . Extracorporeal circuit , require anticoagulation , 3 . Clinically apparent bleeding deem important either PI attend intensivist . Previous enrollment study . Cardiopulmonary instability routine suction within 6 hour NBBAL . Oscillatory ventilation . Cystic fibrosis . Single ventricle physiology . Positive pleural fluid culture result prior Day 1 current hospitalization .</criteria>
