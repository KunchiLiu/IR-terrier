	<brief_summary>Thirty-two healthy volunteer submit experimental pain 2 study day receive Oxycodone 20 mg po vs. placebo . Half volunteer poor metabolizers accord CYP2D6 genotype half extensive metabolizers ( EM ) enzyme normal function . The study hypothesis PM experience less pain relief EM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxycodone semi-synthetic opioid analgesic effect postoperative pain management comparable morphine . Oxycodone N-demethylated CYP2D6 active metabolite oxymorphone , potent μ-receptor agonist . A genetic polymorphism divide Caucasian population two group : 8 % enzyme lacking activity , poor metabolizers ( PM ) rest normal CYP2D6 activity , extensive metabolizers ( EM ) . Many different , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) responsible interindividual difference effect opioids . Among A118G SNP μ-receptor gene OPRM1 C3435T G2677T/A SNPs MDR-1 gene P-glycoprotein . P-glycoprotein responsible absorption , excretion transport many drug include opioids blood-brain barrier . Electrical stimulation cold pressor test among well define evaluate human experimental pain model . The 32 volunteer submit test 1 , 2 , 3 4 hour medicine intake . To determine plasma level Oxycodone metabolites blood drawn pain test . Also CYP2D6 genotype mention SNPs determine blood sample .</detailed_description>
