	<brief_summary>·Main objective : To compare variability fast capillary blood glucose concentration , observed insulin glargine combine insulin glulisine insulin detemir combine insulin glulisine , type 1 diabetic . It non-inferiority study . ·Secondary objective : Efficacy : - To compare variability blood glucose concentration even meal , observed insulin glargine combine insulin glulisine insulin detemir combine insulin glulisine , type 1 diabetic . - To record intra- inter-daily variability use MAGE MODD indices [ 1,2,3,4 ] - To compare glycaemic profile ( 7 point ) - To evaluate HbA1c concentration , end period treatment , weight change , dose insulin use number daily injection . Tolerance : - To record undesirable event - To evaluate safety use record episodes hypoglycaemia ( symptomatic , diurnal , nocturnal , severe ) .</brief_summary>
