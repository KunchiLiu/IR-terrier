The first kangaroo hold take place first 48 hour life . The second kangaroo hold take place day life five seven . Mothers may kangaroo hold infant two time , however study examine kangaroo hold session take place two time specify . This study include physiologic psychologic measurement . Mothers blood pressure heart rate measure two kangaroo hold session . These mother also ask complete self-report stress inventory scale prior first kangaroo hold session ( first 48 hour infant 's life ) second kangaroo hold session ( infant 's day life five seven ) .</detailed_description>
