	<detailed_description>The purpose current proposal pilot new potentially improve treatment neglect . The procedure involve delivery transcutaneous small-amplitude current vestibular nerve lie directly mastoid bone . With intention boost activity damage left hemisphere , positive negative current deliver leave right mastoid respectively . While successfully use rehabilitate gait balance disorder , procedure apply neglect . In present investigation , first confirm optimize condition galvanic vestibular stimulation ( GVS ) ameliorate neglect . This turn justify subsequent work ( late funding cycle ) demonstrate safety efficacy treatment much large clinical scale , merit construction miniaturize portable device .</detailed_description>
