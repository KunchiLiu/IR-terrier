	<brief_title>Treatment Children With Insufficient Secretion Growth Hormone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment recombinant human growth hormone ( somatropin ) proven effective stimulate height velocity improve height child short stature due insufficient endogenous Growth Hormone secretion . Currently somatropin available daily injection formulation . The requirement daily administration cause significant burden interruption normal daily life . A product less frequent dose regimen provide considerable improvement currently available conventional replacement therapy regimens . The primary objective study demonstrate clinical comparability term safety efficacy new sustained release recombinant human growth hormone formulation daily growth hormone .</detailed_description>
