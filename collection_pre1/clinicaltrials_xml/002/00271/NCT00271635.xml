	<detailed_description>Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A ( CMT1A ) , hereditary motor sensory neuropathy type Ia ( HMSN Ia ) , autosomal dominant disease , often cause 1.5 Mb duplication chromosome 17 , give rise three copy peripheral myelin protein 22 gene ( PMP22 ) . Mutations gene rarely cause CMT1A . It primarily demyelinate neuropathy , show nerve conduction study histopathological investigation . The conduction velocities peripheral nerve already slow age five year . Longitudinal data show conduction velocity change life , indicate degree demyelination rather constant life . CMT1A characterize clinically distal muscle weakness wasting , legs arm , impaired distal sensation , reduce absent reflex . Moreover , foot hand deformity often encounter . In childhood , disease progression show . In adult , indication disease progression , properly conduct longitudinal study await . Cross-sectional study show disease severity adult variable : group CMT1A patient asymptomatic ( 5-10 % ) , whereas patient wheelchair dependent ( 5-10 % ) , still classical CMT phenotype . Therapy symptomatic aim maintain functional possibility learn compensation mechanism . There medication available stabilizes improves clinical sign symptom . Ascorbic acid need vitro study proper myelination axon ( culture contain serum ) . Recently , mouse model CMT1A show ascorbic acid improve CMT1A phenotype . Mice ( 2-4 month old ) treat ascorbic acid week three month show increase percentage myelinating nerve fiber show good result locomotor test . In phase 2 study study efficacy safety ascorbic acid young patient CMT1A . We investigate whether ascorbic acid induces remyelination measure nerve conduction peripheral nerve one year study period . CMT1A patient age 12 year old may cooperate sufficiently nerve conduction study . We include young patient , clinical sign symptom especially develop relatively early life . These sign symptom due axonal dysfunction , secondary demyelination . This investigate additionally whether effect ascorbic acid treatment axonal function , strength disability .</detailed_description>
