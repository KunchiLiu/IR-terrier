	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety Effectiveness Durogesic ( Fentanyl Transdermal Patch ) Treatment Children With Chronic Pain Requiring Long-term Narcotic Pain Relief Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study establish analgesic efficacy , safety pharmacokinetic profile Durogesic® treatment pediatric patient chronic pain require long-term opioid therapy . Patients may in-patients treat home . This study consist three phase : pre-trial phase , treatment phase , follow-up phase . During pre-trial phase , patient receive immediate-release oral morphine sustained-release morphine ( minimum daily dose morphine 30 mg/day ) least 48 hour immediately prior entry study . Patients achieve adequate pain relief pre-trial phase enter treatment phase switch Durogesic® . The dose Durogesic® calculate patient 's daily morphine requirement , use conversion regimen . The minimum starting dose one patch fentanyl delivery rate approximately 25 micrograms/hour . Titration step 25 micrograms/hour permit achieve adequate pain control . The maximum allowable dose 300 micrograms/hour . The Durogesic® patch apply area flat skin upper body upper arm , replace every 72 hour . The treatment phase study last 15 day ( 5 consecutive patch change ) . Immediate-release morphine available rescue medication treat breakthrough pain . Upon completion treatment phase , patient may continue receive Durogesic® therapy long-term follow-up phase , long patient , parent investigator feel beneficial . The primary measure effectiveness include patient 's assessment treatment Day 15 , pain level assess patient twice daily , morning evening ( assessed parent patient young age 5 ) , amount rescue medication patient require , pain level time rescue medication give one hour afterwards . In patient venous access ( either central peripheral ) available , blood take purpose , blood sample take determine serum fentanyl concentration . Safety evaluation include incidence adverse event , clinical laboratory test , assessment skin site patch application , vital sign . Durogesic® apply upper body upper arm , replace every 72 hour . The minimum starting dose one patch fentanyl delivery rate approximately 25 micrograms/hour , titrate achieve adequate pain control , maximum dose 300 micrograms/hour . The treatment phase 15 day .</detailed_description>
