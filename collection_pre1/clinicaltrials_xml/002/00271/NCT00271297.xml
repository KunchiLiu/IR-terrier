	<brief_summary>Background : The pelvic floor muscle ( PFM ) locate inside pelvis , surround urethra , vagina rectum . They provide structural support pelvic organ . Dysfunctional PFM lead urine fecal incontinence , pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) , sexual problem chronic pain syndrome . POP increase age , parity weakness PFM . Symptoms associate POP backache , bladder , bowel sexual dysfunction , pelvic heaviness . Thus condition debilitate greatly affect quality life , interfere day-to-day activity reduce participation physical activity . The aim project : As life expectancy increase , woman may experience POP . Hence important prevent treat condition early stage . Despite common disorder among woman , little research do POP . The aim study evaluate effect pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) . PFMT non-invasive method adverse effect . If significant effect , main goal incorporate method clinical practice among physiotherapist medical doctor . If PFM train effective , emphasis PFM training put regular female fitness program . The prevalence POP increase age . Method : This single blind randomise control trial evaluate effect PFMT POP . 100 woman POP randomise either train control group . The training programme last six month , train week physiotherapist addition structure home training programme . A blinded case-control study also carry . 50 woman without POP match age vaginal delivery . Before start RCT study , reproducibility study perineal ultrasound carry 18 woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pelvic Floor Muscle Training ( PFMT ) Treatment Prevention POP ( POP Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background study : The incidence prevalence POP difficult determine , since many woman seek medical advice treatment condition . It estimate half woman give birth lose pelvic floor support , result degree prolapse . Of 10-20 % seek medical help . About 10 % woman one point life undergo surgery prolapse condition . The incidence POP require surgery hysterectomy 3.6 % per 1,000 woman per year UK . Treatment POP conservative ( PFMT ) , mechanical ( use pessary ) surgical . A recently publish Cochrane review conclude study evaluate effect PFMT POP . PFMT without adverse effect , theoretical knowledge anatomy function PFM provide basis try strength training PFM prevent reverse POP . In Norway Bø ( 1990 , 1999 ) PhD , physiotherapist professor Norwegian School Sport Sciences ( NSSS ) , develop train model strengthen PFM . The result several randomise controlled trial program show high cure improvement rate prevention treatment urinary incontinence . Ultrasound MR examination show vaginal delivery pelvic floor situate low position nullipara . In addition , pelvic floor stress urine incontinent ( SUI ) woman low position continent woman . DeLancey et al ( 2003 ) show woman POP generate 43 % less maximum force atrophy pelvic floor muscle woman without prolapse . One main theory explain effectiveness PFMT SUI include factor may change strength training : increase cross-sectional area muscle ( muscle volume ) , neurogen adaptation , impose viscoelastic property ( `` stiffness '' ) connective tissue alter location PFM high level pelvic cavity . Morphological change relation PFMT examine RCTs , show cure rate 44-70 % measure &lt; 2 gram leakage various pad test significant increase muscle strength PFMT . Several study show &gt; 30 % woman unable contract PFM properly first consultation . Bump et al ( 1991 ) show 25 % push downwards instead lift . Other common mistake use muscle group outside pelvic area instead PFM . Instruction , feedback , close follow-up high adherence important factor strength training . Objective : The aim present study evaluate whether PFMT reverse prevent development POP . The project comprise RCT ( main study ) . In addition conduct case-control study investigate risk factor , muscle strength joint flexibility woman without POP . The project description focus RCT . The measurement use case-control study , woman participate RCT case case-control study . Method , design : The main study prospective randomise trial . Women POP refer select community gynaecologist work Oslo Akershus . Those express interest participate project refer physiotherapist manual therapist Ingeborg Hoff Brækken , project manager . The woman participate structure interview ; complete questionnaire symptom quality life undergo clinical examination . Gynaecologist Majida Akershus university hospital conduct ultrasound examination . The woman stratify stage prolapse pelvic floor prolapse quantifying ( POPQ ) . They randomise two group ; PFMT control . Brækken train intervention group Hans &amp; Olaf Fysioterapi A/S . The gynaecologist blind group allocation . After 6 month woman group refer physiotherapist complete questionnaire symptom quality life measure PFM strength . The gynaecologist conduct ultrasound examination POPQ . Drop-out routine : The `` intention treat '' principle follow . Moreover , per-protocol analysis carry complete ≥ 80 % recommend training regimen . Protocol PFMT : 1 . Pre-contraction ( `` knack '' ) . All woman teach contract PFM , increase abdominal pressure ( cough , sneeze , heavy lifting ) 2 . Home training . The intervention group ask perform 3 set 8-12 near maximum contraction per day different position legs abduct . All woman receive booklet DVD show exercise program . Adherence note diary 3 . Training follow-up physiotherapist . The woman visit physiotherapist train vaginal pressure biofeedback week 3 month . For next 3 month train every second week physiotherapist ( total 18 time ) . Muscle strength register visit . The control group receive treatment . After project period refer physiotherapist wish . Case-control study : In parallel training intervention , 50 female control without POP refer gynaecologist . In case-control study woman stage 0 POPQ include control group . They examine way main study group physiotherapist gynaecologist . PFM strength clinical test `` benign hypermobility joint syndrome '' conduct . They also complete form RCT . Statistical analysis : We use SPSS version 11 data analysis relevant statistical method compare group . Results continuous variable give average 95 % CI . Results give number need treat ( NNT ) . The level significance set &lt; 5 % . Professor statistic , Ingar Holme PhD , NSSS , advise project . Ethics Names personal identity number register . All data store locked fireproof cabinet . Data file way project data Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services ( NSD ) Bergen . The project comply Helsinki declaration require participant give write informed consent . The project approve Southern Regional Health Authority 's committee medical ethic .</detailed_description>
