	<detailed_description>Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) heterogeneous group lymphoid malignancy represent 6th lead cause cancer death 2nd fast grow cancer United States . NHLs divide two prognostic group : aggressive indolent lymphoma . Aggressive NHLs grow rapidly present disseminate disease 70 % case , yet cure significant number patient intensive combination chemotherapy regimens . Indolent ( low-grade ) NHLs slow grow malignancy long natural history incurable disseminate . Early stage low-grade NHL ( stage I II ) potential cure radiotherapy , 10-20 % patient low-grade NHL present early stage disease . The vast majority patient low-grade NHL present advance disseminated disease . While indolent B-cell NHLs initial sensitivity chemotherapy radiotherapy , frequently relapse become increasingly resistant therapy successive relapse , eventually transform aggressive lymphoma patient . Fifty percent patient present advanced indolent NHL die within 5 year first relapse . Only modest improvement make last 25 year increase survival patient indolent NHL current median survival 7-10 year . Recent advance field immunotherapy prove benefit patient relapse refractory B-cell NHL . In 1997 , rituximab become first FDA-approved monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) treatment cancer . Rituximab , chimeric IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody , specifically recognize bind CD20 antigen find cell surface normal B-cells malignant B-cell lymphoma . Rituximab bind human complement lyses B-cell line complement dependent cytotoxicity antibody dependent cellular toxicity . A multi-center Phase II trial 166 patient relapsed indolent B-cell lymphoma treat rituximab find overall response 50 % patient 6 % complete response 44 % partial response . Time progression median 13 month patient respond . The introduction radioimmunotherapy ( RIT ) exploit tumor cell target ability mAbs deliver dose radiation tumor limit surround tissue . This especially useful treatment NHL lymphomas highly sensitive radiotherapy . 90Yttrium-ibritumomab tiuxetan ( Zevalin ) unique compound compose murine IgG1 anti-CD20 antibody ibritumomab , linker chelator tiuxetan , radioisotope 90Y chelated via linker . 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan describe provide double hit therapeutic approach CD20+ antibody property rituximab combine radiation therapy . 90Yttrium-ibritumomab tiuxetan appear effective treatment patient refractory treatment rituximab , response rate decrease increase tumor size . 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan approve FDA 2002 treatment patient relapse refractory low-grade , follicular , CD20+ transform B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , rituximab-refractory follicular NHL . A preliminary survey 20 patient treat 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan Cleveland Clinic Foundation 1998-2003 detailed pattern NHL recurrence treatment . The result survey present part Dr. Macklis 2004 annual meet American Society Therapeutic Radiation Oncology ( ASTRO ) Atlanta recently accept publication International Journal Radiation Oncology , Biology , Physics . Based preliminary data , hypothesis make likely site disease recurrence/progression RIT predict volume disease specific site prior RIT . In short , pre-RIT bulky sit disease likely location disease recurrence RIT follow gross , non-bulky , pre-RIT site follow entirely new site . Based hypothesis , might beneficial pre-treat bulky site NHL external beam radiotherapy prior RIT order promote durable response . Doses external beam radiation require consolidate bulky disease sit unclear . In study , plan utilize dose EBRT 2,400cGy bulky site disease follow RIT . Though combined effect 2,400cGy EBRT RIT likely well tolerate , combination sufficiently study . Therefore , primary goal study determine combination EBRT RIT acceptable toxicity profile regard long-term myelosuppression non-hematological toxicity .</detailed_description>
