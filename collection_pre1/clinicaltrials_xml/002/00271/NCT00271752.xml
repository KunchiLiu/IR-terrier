	<brief_summary>This randomise , single blind , multicentre trial evaluate whether daily procalcitonin ( PCT ) measurement immediate diagnostic therapeutic response abnormal value day-to-day change reduce mortality critically ill patient Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Procalcitonin Survival Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis complication sepsis major cause mortality critically ill patient . Rapid treatment sepsis crucial importance survival patient . In ICU , infectious status patient often difficult ass symptom express ( unconscious sedate patient ) sign may present atypically immunologic incompetence mask drug give thermo-therapy . Biological biochemical marker inflammation ( White Blood Cells ( WBC ) , C-reactive protein ) may often influence parameter infection , : trauma , surgery , type inflammation rheumatoid disease ( C-reactive protein ) gluco-corticosteroid treatment ( WBC ) , may unacceptably slowly release progression infection . At time , lack relevant antimicrobial therapy early course infection may fatal patient . For reason , clinical setting , often necessary initiate adjust antimicrobial therapy unsure ground relevant therapy may situations delayed important hour even day . Specific rapid marker bacterial infection seek use ICU . Mortality critically ill patient increase gravely Procalcitonin level increase day day ( submit , though yet unpublished data ) . Low PCT level show effectively rule sepsis . However , randomise control trial conduct show mortality critically ill patient reduce use strategy daily standardise Procalcitonin measurement early detector serious bacterial infection . Therefore evidence presently sufficient introduce daily consecutive Procalcitonin measurement guide diagnostic therapeutic management patient admit ICU . The rationale trial ass ability daily Procalcitonin measurement reduce mortality critically ill patient .</detailed_description>
