	<brief_summary>The Frequent Hemodialysis ( FHN ) Nocturnal Trial randomize control trial recruiting subject dialysis unit associate designated Clinical Centers U.S. Canada follow 12 month . Subjects randomize conventional hemodialysis deliver three day per week home arm six time per week nocturnal home hemodialysis arm follow dialysis prescription provide prescribed standardized Kt/V least 4.0 treatment time least 6.0 hour , six time per week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frequent Hemodialysis Network : Nocturnal Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial randomize , unblinded study six time per week nocturnal home hemodialysis versus three time per week home hemodialysis . A target 150 patient enrol study equal allocation arm , stratify Clinical Center residual renal function . All patient assess suitability nocturnal home hemodialysis use standardized method prior patient enter baseline portion protocol . The minimum dialysis dose standard arm equilibrate Kt/V 1.1 ( equivalent standardize Kt/V ( sKt/V ) 2.0 ) AND minimum time 2.5 hour . In nocturnal arm minimum prescription six hour per session six day per week AND minimum standardized Kt/V 4.0 . Patients follow 12 month . Two co-primary outcome designate : 1 ) composite mortality change 12 month SF-36 RAND physical health composite , 2 ) change 12 month leave ventricular mass . In addition , first priority secondary outcome designate seven outcome domain : 1 ) cardiovascular structure function ( change LV mass ) , 2 ) physical function ( change PHC ) , 3 ) depression/burden illness ( change Beck Depression Inventory ) , 4 ) nutrition ( change serum albumin ) , 5 ) cognitive function ( change Trail Making Test B ) , 6 ) mineral metabolism ( change average predialysis serum phosphorus ) , 7 ) clinical event ( rate non-access hospitalization death ) . Hypertension anemia also main outcome domain , without designation single first priority outcomes . The cost-effectiveness two intervention also compare . The objective study follow : Feasibility : 1 . To determine feasibility recruit retain patient randomized trial six time per week at-home nocturnal hemodialysis versus standard three time per week home hemodialysis . 2 . To determine patient adherence acceptance nocturnal hemodialysis , identify reason discontinuation noncompliance intervention . Safety : 3 . To determine safety nocturnal hemodialysis intervention , particular emphasis vascular access patient burden . Efficacy : 4 . To evaluate efficacy six time per week nocturnal HD compare conventional three time per week HD two co-primary outcome : ) composite mortality change 14 month leave ventricular mass magnetic resonance imaging , ii ) composite mortality change 14 month SF-36 RAND physical health composite score ( PHC ) . 5 . To determine effect six time per week nocturnal HD nine secondary outcome domain : ) cardiovascular structure function , ii ) physical function , iii ) depression/burden illness , iv ) nutrition , v ) cognitive function , vi ) mineral metabolism , vii ) clinical event , viii ) hypertension , ix ) anemia . Characterization Interventions : 6 . To characterize six time per week nocturnal home hemodialysis intervention comparison standard home three time per week hemodialysis , include evaluation small middle molecule solute clearance , treatment time , volume removal . Implementation : 7 . To determine feasibility implement six time per week nocturnal home hemodialysis practice , include evaluation barrier implementation home environment potential incremental cost nocturnal home hemodialysis compare three time per week conventional hemodialysis . An evaluation cost effectiveness six time per week home nocturnal HD relative compare 3 time per week conventional home HD perform .</detailed_description>
