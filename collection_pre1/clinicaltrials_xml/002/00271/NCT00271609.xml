	<brief_summary>Background : Bevacizumab genetically engineer antibody block growth new blood vessel tumor . Inhibiting formation blood vessel may slow stop disease progression diminish supply life-sustaining nutrient oxygen blood delivers tumor . Bevacizumab approve treat colorectal cancer show activity brain tumor cell laboratory animal test . Objectives : To examine safety side effect bevacizumab patient recurrent brain tumor . To determine anti-tumor activity bevacizumab patient recurrent brain tumor . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old brain tumor continue grow receive standard treatment . Design : Patients complete follow procedure study : - Infusions bevacizumab vein every 2 week 4-week treatment cycle . - Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan first dose bevacizumab , end first treatment cycle , need . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan first dose bevacizumab , within 48-96 hour first dose bevacizumab first treatment cycle , every 4 week . One tube blood research collect time MRI scan look specific cell . - Physical neurological examination every 2 week first treatment cycle every 4 week . - Quality-of-life questionnaire every 4 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - In vivo experiment document ability anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) antibody like bevacizumab inhibit tumor growth various preclinical tumor model , include glioma . - Given pronounced neovasculature associate over-expression VEGF malignant glioma , abundant publish data demonstrate dependence glioma growth maintenance proliferation neovasculature , bevacizumab represent potentially promising new therapeutic approach otherwise refractory tumor . Objective - To establish data regard anti-tumor activity bevacizumab patient recurrent high-grade glioma determine progression-free-survival . - To obtain information regard safety bevacizumab administer patient recurrent high-grade glioma . Eligibility - Adult patient histologically prove intracranial malignant glioma - Patients must evidence tumor progression magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan - Patients must progress radiation therapy must interval great equal 4 week completion radiation therapy study entry Design - Patients treat bevacizumab intravenous injection dose 10mg/kg every two week 4-week cycle . - Prior first dose bevacizumab completion first 4-weeks treatment , patient undergo fludeoxyglucose 18F -positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) scan ( cycle one need ) MRI perfusion scan . - Peripheral blood circulate endothelial progenitor cell collected time MRI-perfusion scan . Additionally , patient undergo MRI perfusion scan within 48-96 hour first dose bevacizumab ( cycle one ) . - For patient clinically/neurologically stable stable respond radiographic disease end treatment cycle , treatment continue bevacizumab every 2 week , repeat MRI-perfusion scan conclusion ( e.g . prior another administration bevacizumab ) 4 week cycle . A total 88 patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
