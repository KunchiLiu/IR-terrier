	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) one common cancer United States 145,000 new case expect 2005 . Surgery main treatment CRC . However relapse surgery , unable surgery , chemotherapy primary treatment advance CRC . Some chemotherapy drug give patient , many give combination chemotherapy treatment drug seem work well together . This study investigate effectiveness combination three chemotherapy drug patient previously treat CRC return . This study also evaluate rash associate drug Cetuximab . The three therapy drug Mitomycin C , Irinotecan , Cetuximab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Mitomycin C , Irinotecan , Cetuximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose phase II trial combine mitomycin C , irinotecan cetuximab patient previously treat metastatic colorectal cancer wild type non mutate K-Ras . The goal investigation develop effective systemic therapy previously treat patient CRC wild type K-Ras , explore relationship mitomycin C induce topoisomerase 1 gene expression response irinotecan , define characterize biology cetuximab induce skin rash .</detailed_description>
