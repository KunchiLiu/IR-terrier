	<brief_title>A 15-day Study Assess Safety Clinical Utility Duragesic ( Fentanyl Transdermal Patch ) Treatment Children With Continuous Pain Requiring Narcotic Pain Relief Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new dosage strength Duragesic® TTS patch develop deliver 12.5 microgram fentanyl per hour , consider equi-analgesic daily dose 45 mg morphine administer orally , consider safe start dose child age 2 12 year . This single-arm , non-randomized , open-label , 15-day multicenter trial determine safety , clinical utility , pharmacokinetics Duragesic® pediatric subject require treatment potent opioid management continuous pain , allow individual titration . After 15-day primary treatment period , subject may , investigator 's discretion , continue long-term treatment Duragesic® period 1 year . All subject start treatment 12.5 micrograms/hour patch . Immediate-release morphine available treat breakthrough pain . The patch replace every 72 hour . The objective subject pain-free much possible , use least possible rescue medication . Duragesic® dose increase consider base rescue medication consumption pain assessment . Where subject maintain pain-free daily consumption 45 mg rescue morphine , dose increase Duragesic® 12.5 micrograms/hour permit . No increase Duragesic® dose perform within 72-hour dose interval . The primary outcome study assessment safety , include incidence severity adverse event , physical examination result vital sign . Clinical utility assess parent 's treatment assessment pain relief , tolerability convenience ( pre-treatment patch change ) ; investigator 's parent 's global assessment Day 16 pain control , adverse event , convenience ; daily measure pain level ; use rescue medication ; child 's play performance . Pharmacokinetics also assess . Duragesic® apply upper torso , replace every 72 hour . The initial dose one patch fentanyl delivery rate approximately 12.5 micrograms/hour . Dose increase step 12.5 micrograms/hour consider pain inadequately control . The treatment phase 15 day .</detailed_description>
