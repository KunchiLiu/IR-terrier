	<brief_summary>The purpose study see two dos PEG ( polyethylene glycol ) interferon alfa-2b combination Ribavirin 48 week effective elimination hepatitis C. The primary objective study compare efficacy Induction PEG-Interferon alfa-2b ( PEG-Intron ) Ribavirin ( Rebetol ) standard PEG-Interferon alfa-2b ( PEG-Intron ) Ribavirin ( Rebetol ) patient chronic hepatitis C .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Induction PEG-Intron Combination With Rebetol Enhance Sustained Response Rates Patients With CHC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine use induction dose PEG-Intron combination Rebetol enhance elimination Hepatitis C treatment naïve patient genotype 1 4 . Currently PEG-Interferon alfa-2b plus Ribavirin result sustain response 54-61 % patient Hepatitis C. Those genotype 1and 4 high viral load likely less favorable response . The administration induction dose interferon combination Ribavirin may yield improved sustain response rate difficult treat patient chronic Hepatitis C .</detailed_description>
