	<brief_title>Study Complementary Therapies Men Receiving Radiation Therapy Prostate Cancer : A Feasibility Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part mission Dana-Farber/Brigham Women 's Cancer Center enhance quality life cancer patient family . Treatments therapy specifically design address change cognitive , emotional spiritual realm experience patient attempt cope cancer routinely offer addition standard experimental medical therapy fall realm complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) support . Our patient may participate support group ; work social worker , psychologist psychiatrist privately ; learn diet seminar meet dietician ; participate art music therapy ; participate many program offer Leonard P. Zakim Center , include Reiki therapy , acupuncture , acupressure , massage therapeutic touch . All service provide hope participant derive benefit , however intangible . That cancer patient experience significant short- long-term psychological distress associate cancer diagnosis treatment well documented.1-4 Most feel strong sense lose self-control experience disturbance appetite , sleep , concentration , stamina.5-9 Anxiety depression appear almost ubiquitous cancer diagnosis , include men diagnose prostate cancer.8,10-12 This may explain prevalence prostate cancer support group , internet site self-help book . However , little precise information prostate cancer population regard choice make regard CAM information CAM therapy affect . There data use CAM prostate cancer populations.13-16 In study 1,099 men , prostate cancer diagnosis prompt 23.5 % sample start use form CAM health , 67 % group report used form CAM prostate health diagnosed.17 The study include 14 herbal dietary therapy 16 mind-body therapy . There demographic difference patient opt CAM use . Patients choose CAM likely white versus , likely college-educated versus . The latter variable particularly significant analysis . A second study patient live around San Francisco report 543 prostate cancer patient complete 30-minute telephone interview regard complementary alternative medicines.14 Overall , 30 % participant use least one type complementary alternative medicine . CAM user young non-users likely college graduate . In group , herbal remedy mental health approach commonly utilize , follow dietary change . Twelve percent population use two CAM approaches.11 For study , chose look two form CAM , Reiki relaxation response therapy ( RRT ) . These two chosen evidence utilization within cancer population . Reiki treatment give Zakim Center . In four year since Zakim Center open , approximately 300 patient visit Reiki therapy . Reiki energy heal method discover late 1800s Japan . The word Reiki make two Japanese word : Rei , unlimited universal power force act create matter ; Ki , live spirit energy applies physical principle life . Licensed Reiki Masters perform Reiki . All Reiki Masters Zakim Center also register nurse . Subjects often express enhanced sense well-being relaxation Reiki session , accord Reiki practitioner , return least one session . Led Susan DeCristofaro , Reiki experience Zakim Center standardize . Here , Reiki give acute chronic pain , headache , depression , anxiety , nausea , vomit insomnia . The fee Reiki session $ 55.00 . However , effect receive Reiki subject rigorous scientific study . In review energy healing , eleven study look Reiki review . Of , seven show beneficial effect,18-22 three show effect21,23,24 one negative effect.25 We believe , review data , many unanswered question treatment . The second CAM interest u relaxation response therapy ( RRT ) , describe pioneer Mind/Body Medical Institute , direct Herbert Benson , MD . The Mind/Body Medical Institute independent , nonprofit organization dedicate study mind/body interaction , include RRT . Three four hundred cancer patient per year participate program Mind/Body Medical Institute . Interventions use RRT combination cognitive restructuring ( CR ) counsel commonly employ felt 'successful ' cancer patient practitioner deliver . The term `` relaxation response '' first coin 1974.26,27 This technique two characteristic : repetition word phrase disregard everyday thought . The elicitation RR down-regulates sympathetic nervous system . It characterize reduction oxygen consumption , respiratory rate , blood pressure , heart rate arterial blood lactate . The mind/body state achieve RR consistent wakeful , hypometabolic physiological state.28 EEG study clearly differentiate RR sleep.29 PET30 fMRI31 study correlate specific regional change brain activity elicitation RR . When patient relaxed state , therapist focus help identify emotion , negative thought anxiety assist deal thought constructive way . This call `` cognitive restructuring '' integral part RT . RRT believe useful therapeutic intervention numerous condition include : headache ; 32-34 premature ventricular contraction stable ischemic heart disease hypertension ; 35-38 anxiety ; 39,40 stress symptom ; 41 cardiac surgery ; 37 pain relief anxiety reduction femoral arteriography ; 42 premenstrual syndrome ; 43 infertility ; 44 psychosomatic complaint ; 45 chronic pain ; 46-48 insomnia.29 Other investigator also find RRT technique effective treatment rheumatoid arthritis . The fee RT cognitive restructuring $ 100.00 per hour , pay privately insurance . Thus , identify two reasonably mature CAM therapy offer apparently utilized patient , pay patient insurance provider , believe practitioner beneficial patient without much solid evidence support use . We also know prostate cancer patient high level interest CAM . With mind , apply receive grant Advanced Medical Research Foundation submit protocol Dana-Farber/ Harvard Cancer Center Internal Review Board primary aim assess feasibility recruit maintain enrollment CAM therapy 8-week course RT 2-month follow-up period . Our protocol accept , # 05-005 , accrue patient .</detailed_description>
