	<brief_summary>Current treatment emphysema limit measure include inhaled oxygen , bronchodilator , anti-inflammatory drug pulmonary rehabilitation . Highly invasive procedure lung volume reduction surgery lung transplantation also perform . Treatment use Exhale Drug-Eluting Stent ( DES ) minimally invasive bronchoscopic treatment potential reduce shortness breath emphysema patient . This study test safety effect Exhale DES treatment patient emphysema .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Emphysema affect estimate 60 million people worldwide major cause morbidity mortality . In basic term , emphysema cause destruction lung parenchyma result collateral ventilation one part lung another disrupt alveolar wall , point gas transport one part lung another may exceed gas flow small airway . In word , gas move freely within lung , get , cause inflation , hyperinflation diseased lung . When disease far advanced , patient afflict disable dyspnea progressively restrict activity eventually cause great suffering . The crippling effect end-stage emphysema , include severe dyspnea mark limitation activity , relate large measure dynamic hyperinflation lung associate loss elasticity , gas trap collapse small airway . The progressive enlargement thorax flatten diaphragm render inspiratory muscle inefficient , increase work breathe contribute feeling breathlessness . The major medical therapeutic modality include bronchodilator anti-inflammatory drug direct decrease airway resistance antibiotic combat infection . Pulmonary rehabilitation technique exercise train proven palliative benefit . In general , result medical treatment advance airway obstruction frequently result persistently anguish patient frustrate physician . A system could efficiently decompress emphysematous lung breath would result significant clinical benefit , include lessen dyspnea , decrease work breathing , increase exercise tolerance . In addition medical therapy , two surgical therapy available emphysema sufferer : Lung transplantation Lung Volume Reduction Surgery ( LVRS ) . In National Emphysema Treatment Trial ( NETT ) , LVRS show effective sub-set emphysema patient , drawback increase short-term mortality compare medical control arm . This likely due invasiveness LVRS . Lung transplantation widely accept surgical treatment emphysema ; however unrealistic option patient . The selection criterion stringent acceptance receive donor lung ( ) . Lung transplantation carry high long-term morbidity mortality severely limited shortage available donor lung . We seek take advantage collateral ventilation see advanced emphysema create passageway lung parenchyma large airway , air escape lungs exhalation . The Exhale therapeutic intervention applicable majority emphysema patient suffer hyperinflation lung . It would desirable therapeutic option less invasive readily available emphysema sufferer . We work therapy begin investigate clinic .</detailed_description>
