	<brief_summary>Acute kidney failure common child Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) . You ask participate study child treat kidney failure continuous veno-venous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) . CVVH continuous , gentle form remove excess fluid small waste blood , similar kidney dialysis ( artificial kidney ) . It accept therapy temporary support kidney failure . In patient acute kidney failure , begin CVVH follow temporary decrease urine output . The reason happen currently unknown . The purpose study determine happen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute renal failure common child pediatric intensive care unit . Renal replacement therapy peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) , intermittent hemodialysis ( IHD ) , continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) use management acute renal failure . CVVH become increasingly utilized pediatric acute renal failure . However , patient acute renal failure , institution CVVH often follow progression oliguria anuria . The underlying pathophysiology change unknown . We believe progression influence change renin-angiotensin axis , cytokine response , modifier renal hemodynamics . By serially measure component system , study attempt elucidate pathophysiology decrease urine output see institution CVVH . Once process understood , future study focus prevention treatment complication . General Hypothesis The decrease urine output see initiation CVVH associate increase angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) level , increase renin activity , increase angiotensin II level , increase atrial naturetic peptide ( ANP ) level , increase endothelin-1 level , increase arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) level , alteration cytokine level modulators apoptosis .</detailed_description>
