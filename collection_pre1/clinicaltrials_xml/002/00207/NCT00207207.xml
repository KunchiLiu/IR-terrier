	<brief_summary>The objective ass effect use ASBG ( alternate site blood glucose ) versus FTBG ( finger tip blood glucose ) test long-term glycemic control diabetic . Since ASBG measurement appear lag behind FSBG measurement time change glucose concentration , possible ASBG measurement yield low postprandial reading FTBG , potentially cause negative impact long-term control . It also possible since ASBG reportedly comfortable FTBG testing , 's use might improve adherence test improve long term control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self Monitoring Blood Glucose With Finger Tip vs. Alternate Site Sampling : Effect Long Term Glycemic Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo initial screen visit . Inclusion criterion include adult 18 -70 year age type II diabetes currently use insulin record SMBG measurement . Exclusion criterion include history severe hypoglycemic episode , current use ASBG measurement , serious co-morbid illness pregnancy . For eligible subject baseline data include HbA1C obtain . The goal enrollment 176 subject . Subjects randomize either fingertip arm-testing group within stratum baseline HbA1C . Each subject already one receive One Touch UltraÂ® SMBG device . All subject receive training use device , arm-testing group include train obtain sample forearm . Arm- test subject encourage use arm testing much possible use finger test able obtain sample arm . All subject ask perform SMBG test breakfast , dinner 2 hour dinner complete diary SMBG reading . At 1 , 3 5 month train visit subject see diabetes provider make adjustment therapeutic regimen base SMBG measurement , would routine diabetes management . Diary sheet collect data contain enter database . At month 2 , 4 7 subject present visit drop diary sheet . At month 4 7 blood drawn HbA1C measurement . The principal outcome variable level diabetic control measure 7-month HbA1c . The mean group compare , test hypothesis glycemic control represent 7-month HbA1C bad ASBG group FTBG group . Secondary outcome variable compliance test number hypoglycemic episode .</detailed_description>
