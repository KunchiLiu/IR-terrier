	<detailed_description>Engaging regular physical activity require moderate vigorous effort relate good health reduce risk multitude disease . Currently physical activity health promotion research limit self- report data confound participant ' ability accurately remember record physical activity . A potentially new method accurately assess moderate-intensity physical activity call context sensitive- ecological momentary assessment ( CS-EMA ) . Mobile compute device ( personal computing device , PDAs ) automatically identify specific type physical activity ( e.g. , moderate-intensity physical activity ) perform potential provide valuable objective data naturalistic , experimental , clinical intervention research purpose , potential educational , recreational , clinical application . The goal exploratory study assess accuracy two method collect data moderate-intensity physical activity . The study compare use paper diary collect self-reported data moderate-intensity physical activity perform throughout day self-reported data collect use ecological momentary assessment method facilitate PDA cue participant record specific intensity level physical activity achieve . This study also develop algorithms automatically identify specific type physical activity perform . The data collect heart rate monitor , motion sensor , information request directly participant via PDA interface use train pattern recognition system classify intensity type physical activity perform participant . This study contribute research context- awareness human activity recognition .</detailed_description>
