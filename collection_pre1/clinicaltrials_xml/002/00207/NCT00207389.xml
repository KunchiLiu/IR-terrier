	<brief_summary>Obesity multinational epidemic . There evidence despite educational measure increase public awareness , number obese individual continue increase . Of numerous obesity-related comorbidities , type 2 diabetes remain one significant term mortality health care cost . Gastric Bypass Surgery ( GBS ) offer effective form therapy morbid obesity , also amelioration type 2 diabetes mellitus . The normalization glucose level GBS patient occur within day surgery show surgical literature independent weight loss surgery . The proximal gut , site release certain incretins , may play role glucose homeostasis obese individual type 2 diabetes mellitus . One incretin GIP , release circulation immediate postprandial period , accentuate insulin response glucose meal . It hypothesize overactivity enteroinsular axis obese individual produce cell resistance insulin subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus . A previous study report elevated fasting GIP level , well exaggerated GIP response glucose meal , obese subject , significantly reduce month GBS follow weight loss . This pilot study obese patient schedule GBS compare serum level certain peptide , include GIP , follow glucose meal GBS , weight loss occur . In order reproduce preoperative state , therefore demonstrate physiologic change , small group subject undergo open surgery undergo measurement surgery , use model meal traverse stomach , duodenum jejunum aid gastrostomy tube .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Examine Changes GIP Plasma Levels Following Gastric Bypass Surgery Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study collect relevant information planning large definitive investigation . A total thirty subject evaluate study conduct Boston Medical Center . The study population consist obese patient meet criterion schedule surgeon GBS . We plan enroll total 30 subject schedule GBS . Patients assign accord standard surgical care either open laparoscopic surgery . We plan enroll 20 subject undergo laparoscopic GBS ( LAP ) 10 subject undergo open GBS ( OPEN ) . All potential subject undergone baseline screen part routine medical evaluation perform Dr. Apovian Dr. McDonnell Nutrition Center BMC . This standard test include medical history , physical examination , complete blood count , serum electrolyte , BUN , creatinine , fast blood glucose glycosylated hemoglobin . If patient identify type 2 diabetes glucose intolerance , provide informed consent . If consent subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion , undergo baseline oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) approximately one week surgery . Plasma concentration insulin , GIP , glucagon , GLP-1 also measure along glucose level peptide ( CCK , ghrelin , c-peptide ) interval , use commercially available assay kit . Post-operatively , subject LAP group undergo 2 OGTTs , subject OPEN group undergo 2 OGTTs one glucose tolerance test gastrostomy tube ( GGTT ) . The result postoperative OGTTs compare baseline OGTTs . In separate analysis , result GGTTs compare baseline postoperative OGTTs . Inclusion criteria Patients 21-64 ear age obesity ( define body mass index , BMI , &gt; = 30 ) type 2 diabetes impair glucose tolerance , select schedule gastric bypass surgery . Exclusion criterion Substance abuse , consumption two alcoholic drink per day , use 20 unit insulin ( brand type ) per day , fast blood glucose &gt; 180mg/dl screen bloodwork . F2 . Procedure All subject undergo total 3 OGTTs , 1 surgery 2 . The OPEN group also glucose tolerance test via gastrostomy tube ( GGTT ) place duodenum ( per routine surgical procedure ) described . The OGTT consist 12-hour overnight fast follow drink 225 ml solution contain 75 gram glucose ( Glucola ) , 30 minute . 30 minute average time patient require order drink 225ml Glucola drink gastric bypass surgery . In order able make valid comparison three OGTTs , OGTT require subject drink 30 minute . Blood sample obtain intravenous catheter various time interval : 5 minute immediately drink Glucola , 5 , 10 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 minute afterwards . Blood level glucose , insulin , glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) , glucagon , Glucagon-Like Peptide ( GLP-1 ) , CCK , ghrelin c-peptide determine sample obtain . In addition , hour 2 OGTT ( glucose peak ) obtain real-time glucose level drop blood indwell line . The GGTT follow protocol OGTT , Glucola administer via gastrostomy tube , place per routine surgical procedure patient undergo open GBS . Approximately 1 week surgery , subject undergo OGTT GCRC . Between day 6 10 surgery , subject tolerate standard 240cc liquid meal 3-4 time daily , subject undergo third OGTT . Although subject discharge day 3 4 surgery , ask return GCRC , subject remain hospital day 5 option remain hospital additional time ( 1-2 day ) go home return GCRC within 5 day ( late POD 10 ) The additional hospital day pay GCRC . After surgery , subject LAP group one OGTT . Subjects OPEN group GGTT one day OGTT follow day . Subjects weigh surgery every day first week surgery glucose tolerance test . All subject undergo final OGTT approximately 3 -4 week surgery . This take place GCRC day routine follow visit surgeon . Patients contact telephone assessment approximately 24 hour GTT . There 2 primary outcome : 1 ) Change plasma GIP response glucose GBS 2 ) change insulin sensitivity GBS , measure area-under-the-curve equation standardize 180-minute oral glucose tolerance test . Secondary outcome include 1 ) Change plasma GLP-1 response glucose GBS 2 ) change plasma glucagon response glucose GBS , measure equation use primary outcome . We expect enrollment period 18 month 24 month . The estimated duration entire study 28 month</detailed_description>
