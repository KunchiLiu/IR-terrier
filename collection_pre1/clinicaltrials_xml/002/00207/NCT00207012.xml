	<criteria>Signed write informed consent Available periodic followup Life expectancy least 3 month ECOG performance status score 01 Histologic cytologic diagnosis primary malignancy breast , ovarian , bladder , gastric , non small cell lung colon origin Tumor paraffin tissue block 2030 unstained slide tumor issue block must provide biomarker predictive marker analysis Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) analysis tumor biopsy demonstrate 1+ , 2+ 3+ HER3 expression EGFR expression . For patient breast cancer tumor must HER2 FISH positive ( fluorescence situ hybridization ) . This analysis may perform hospital laboratory Evidence ( radiographic tissue confirmation ) disease metastatic ( locally advance disease allowable surgical local therapeutic option exists ) Disease progress follow currently available standard therapy standard therapy exists . ( Prior adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy permit . Prior investigational agent permit ) Measurable nonmeasurable disease Adequate bone marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ( neutrophil band ) &gt; =1,500 cells/mm3 platelet count &gt; =1000,000 cells/mm3 hemoglobin &gt; = 9.0 g/dl Adequate hepatic function define : total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; =2.5 time institutional upper limit normal Adequate renal function define : serum creatine &lt; =1.5 time institutional upper normal limit PTINR/PTT , =1.5 x upper limit normal . Prophylactic coumadin allow Serum potassium , calcium magnesium level within institutional normal limit Prior anticancer chemo , radio , hormonal immunotherapy allow . Patients must recover toxicity due prior therapy ( i.e. , toxicity resolve baseline deem irreversible ) . At least 4 week must hav elapse since last chemotherapy ( 6 week nitrosoureas , mitomycinC , liposomal doxorubicin ) , immunotherapy radiotherapy begin protocol therapy . At least 2 week must elapse since last anticancer hormonal therapy `` target '' kinase inhibitor ( e.g . Herceptin ) Men woman , age 18 Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study least 3 month study manner risk pregnancy minimize WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal Even woman use oral , implanted injectable contraceptive hormone mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy practice abstinence partner sterile ( e.g . vasectomy ) consider child bear potential . WOCP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour prior start study medication . WOCBP unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period least 3 month study WOCBP use prohibit contraceptive method Women pregnant breastfeed Women positive pregnancy test enrollment prior study drug administration Men unwilling unable use acceptable method birth control sexual partner WOCBP entire study period least 3 month completion study Patients know brain metastasis . Patients control brain metastasis ( progression 60 day follow defined treatment neurologic sign symptom ) allow . Patients sign symptom suggestive brain metastasis eligible unless brain metastasis rule CT MRI A serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair ability patient receive protocol therapy Uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease , include : A myocardial infarction within 12 month Uncontrolled angina within 6 month Congestive heart failure within 4 month leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) low limit normal 45 % Diagnosed suspected congenital long QT syndrome Any history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , torsade de pointes ) . Any patient history arrhythmia discuss bMS Medical Monitor prior entry study Prolonged QTc interval preentry electrocardiogram ( &gt; 450 msec ) Any history second third degree heart block ( may eligible currently pacemaker ) Heart rate &lt; 50/minute preentry electrocardiogram Uncontrolled hypertension Dementia alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent Known allergy BMS599626 relate compound Investigational agent within 4 week prior start protocol therapy Recent anticancer therapy Drugs ( medical condition ) generally accept risk cause Torsade de Pointes . Patients discontinued medication must washout period least 5 day least 5 halflives drug ( whichever great ) prior first dose BMS599626 Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric physical ( e.g. , infectious disease ) illness must enrol study</criteria>
