	<brief_summary>Nearly patient Duchenne 's Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) scoliosis . Posterior instrument spinal fusion , surgery correct scoliosis , show improve quality life satisfaction parent family . The progressive muscular weakness lead development scoliosis soon child become unable walk . The muscular weakness scoliosis also affect pulmonary function child . Pulmonary Function Tests ( PFT ) use determine `` pulmonary fitness '' prior surgery way determine well child tolerate surgery . Children poor result PFT determine fragile tolerate large operation . The physician conduct study feel PFT may inaccurate may best single test determine `` pulmonary fitness '' . The physician conduct study think thing like time day study do , tire complete test , well understand test may affect result test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Test-Retest Reliability Pulmonary Function Tests Patients With Duchenne 's Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient DMD routine PFT 's every six month standard care . You randomize one two group . The group assignment choose chance , similar flipping coin . If assign group one first regularly schedule PFT morning . You ask complete second PFT afternoon least 4 hour first PFT . You ask come back clinic two week repeat PFT 's , morning afternoon least 4 hour apart . Each PFT take approximately 10 15 minute . If assign group two , regularly schedule PFT morning second test afternoon least four hour first test . After second PFT receive training Respiratory Therapist .
