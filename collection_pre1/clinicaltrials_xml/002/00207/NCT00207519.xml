Dyslipidemia define total cholesterol &gt; 200 mg/dl , LDL &gt; 130 mg/dl , HDL &lt; 40 mg/dl male subject &lt; 50 mg/dl female subject , triacylglycerol &gt; 150 mg/dl . Insulin resistance/diabetes shall define fast glucose &gt; 110 mg/dl . Calculating Estimated Caloric Need : Total caloric need subject BMI &gt; 85th % age sex shall calculate use Basal Energy Expenditure multiply Activity Factor ( estimate total energy requirement ) , subtract 250-500 calorie ( achieve 0.5 1 pound weight loss per week ) . Basal Energy Expenditure calculate use Harris-Benedict equation follow : Females = 655 + 4.4 ( wt . lb ) + 4.3 ( ht . inch ) - 4.7 ( age yr ) x AF Males = 66 + 6.2 ( wt . lb ) +12.7 ( ht . inch ) - 6.8 ( age yr ) x AF Activity Factors ( AF ) : 1.1 Restricted Activity 1.2 Sedentary ( commonly use ) 1.3 Cardiovascular Activity 3x/wk Ideal body weight define : Females = 100 lb first 5 ft + 5 lb inch 5 ft Males = 106 lb first 5 ft + 6 lb inch 5 ft Subjects prescribe meal plan consist 3 meal 2 snack per day .
