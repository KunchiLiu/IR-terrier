	<detailed_description>Hyperuricemia common metabolic disorder . It result decreased renal uric acid excretion , increased urate production , . The classical association clinical gout well-known . The principal indication uric acidâ€“lowering therapy , include allopurinol , probenecid sulfinpyrazone , patient gout history , macroscopic subcutaneous tophus , frequent attack gouty arthritis , document state uric acid overproduction . Hyperuricemia often associate metabolic syndrome , know percursor atherosclerosis . For gout attack 5 % per year hyperuricemic population , medical management indicate patient without gouty arthritis . Diet control lead way control serum uric acid level , usually enough . So management hyperuricemia important potential management.Histidine-containing dipeptides Anserine Carnosine study extensively recent year . These dipeptides show effective act buffer agent proton develop anaerobic exercise . Anserine Carnosine also strong anti-oxidant activity , anti-cancer activity , immuno-response modulation , fat reduction enhance wound heal function . The Yaizu Suisankagaku Industry Company develop industrial production process extract purify dipeptides Bonito Tuna . The extract , name Marine Active , able offer anti-fatigue activity animal trial data . Human clinical trial show reduction creatine phosphokinase activity sero-uric acid . Randomize , double blind clinical trial entrust hospital . This study design blood sample health men take 1 gm marine active analyse pharmacokinetics anserine .</detailed_description>
