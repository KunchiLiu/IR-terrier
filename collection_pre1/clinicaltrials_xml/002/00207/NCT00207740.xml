	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy CNTO 148 Patients With Severe Persistent Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient know treatment patient receives ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical study ) , parallel-group ( group patient treat time ) , dose-ranging study evaluate efficacy safety CNTO 148 . The study consist run-in phase ( 2 week ) , treatment period ( 52 week ) follow period ( 24 week ) . The patient inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) medication standardize run-in phase treatment period contain first 24 week treatment , patient require remain stable dos concomitant corticosteroid ( CS ) medication ( steroid stable phase ) . The steroid stable phase follow 28-week steroid taper phase , reduction concomitant CS medication attempt . After completion study treatment , patient follow additional 24 week . Patients receive subcutaneous injection 75 , 150 , 300 mg CNTO 148 placebo every 4 week 52 week follow 50,100 , 200 mg every 4 week week 52 . The safety patient monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
