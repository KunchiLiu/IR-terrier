	<brief_title>Neurosurgical Use Interstitial Laser Therapy ( ILT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal evaluate use minimally invasive interstitial laser therapy ( ILT ) brain . Our group unique position offer image-guided ILT expertise resource Brigham &amp; Women 's Hospital Departments Neurosurgery Radiology . The therapy monitor control use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . ILT minimally invasive procedure target tissue thermally destroy situ control fashion . The intra-operative MRI provide way `` see '' treatment . It use treat disease guide surgery providing image tissue change therapy . In spite appeal minimally invasive technique , MRI-guided ILT commonly practice United States . One reason proper clinical implementation ILT require operate room ( OR ) set MRI scanner - rare combination . Our MRI-OR suite include sterile procedure room 0.5 Tesla vertically `` open '' magnet . In past , perform MRI-guided ILT procedure 9 patient . While number , extensive U.S. experience ILT brain . We recently create new image networking display package visualization 3D information laser therapy . This provide view multiple image plane take tissue volume around fiber tip light emits . Recent FDA approval `` diffusing tip '' laser associate catheter , provide u add tool procedure . This diffuse technology available Europe clinical use year ; however , FDA-approved device US . The catheter important protects fiber ; place tumor first MRI guidance . Then laser fiber inserted catheter deliver light . All equipment use protocol FDA approve . Each patient undergo ILT . The procedure perform anesthesia per standard procedure . The surgical placement laser fiber procedure identical well-developed practice technique brain biopsy . A hole approximately 1 cm diameter drill skull laser fiber place image guidance confirm actual progress advance fiber . We deliver energy rate distribution 1-12 watts/cm exposure less 20 minute . After laser turn , tissue cool , MRI show region ablation . As need , laser fiber moved/re-located assure total target ablate . After treatment complete , fiber withdrawn , final image acquire surgical site close dress . On day procedure , patient undergo 24 hour follow-up MRI exam . There post-operative care neurosurgical patient . The follow continuous variable measure study : - The pre-operative tumor volume ( VO ) cc - The post-operative ablated volume ( V1 ) cc - The intra-operative critical temperature volume ( VT ) cc - The intra-operative critical dose volume ( VD ) cc The following statistical hypothesis test conduct . Statistical Hypothesis 1 . A tumor completely ablate ILT MRI-guidance . We propose difference mean pre-op tumor volume post-op ablate volume ( VO V1 , respectively ) zero . Residual tumor define ( V0-V1 ) . This determine calculate mean value proportion residual tumor , define ( V0-V1 ) / V0 . Use proportion normalizes data different sized tumor . Statistical Hypothesis 2 . The MRI-based 3-D temperature map tissue ILT predictive destruction . We propose difference mean post-op ablate volume intra-operative critical temperature volume ( VT V1 , respectively ) zero . This determine calculate mean value proportion difference , define ( VT-V1 ) /VT . Statistical Hypothesis 3 . The thermal dose map predictive tissue destruction . We propose difference mean post-op ablate volume intra-operative critical dose volume ( VD V1 , respectively ) zero . This determine calculate mean value proportion difference , define ( VD-V1 /VD ) . Also , data collect Neurological Examinations .</detailed_description>
