	<brief_title>The Use Silver Leaf Dressing Prevention Radiotherapy Induced Skin Reactions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The delivery whole breast radiotherapy woman deep inframammary fold frequently result mark skin reaction ( brisk erythema and/or moist desquamation ) . The main aim study compare efficacy prophylactic silver leaf nylon dressing standard skin care standard skin care alone prevention brisk erythema moist desquamation . A secondary aim study ass whether use silver leaf nylon dressing reduce breast-related symptom pain , burn sensation itch woman undergo whole breast radiotherapy . Hypothesis : The hypothesis silver leaf nylon dress reduces percentage patient develop brisk erythema moist desquamation undergo whole breast radiotherapy . The secondary hypothesis silver leaf nylon dress reduces breast-related symptom pain , itch burn sensation patient receive whole breast radiotherapy . The null hypothesis reduction brisk erythema , moist desquamation breast-related symptom patient undergoing whole breast radiotherapy use silver leaf nylon dress . Justification : Severe skin reaction common patient deep inframammary fold undergo whole breast radiotherapy . It may possible reduce severity skin reaction population patient use silver leaf nylon dressing . This might make whole breast radiotherapy tolerable patient . Objectives : The objective study compare severity skin reaction patient deep inframammary skin fold undergoing whole breast radiotherapy ( use Radiation Therapy Oncology Group score system , well supplementary score system ) experimental arm control arm , compare severity breast- relate symptom ( use visual analogue scale ) , topical steroid use analgesic use two study arm . Research Method : This single blind randomise control trial . The target population comprise patient deep inframammary fold undergoing whole breast radiotherapy . Patients randomise follow standard skin care recommendation throughout radiotherapy treatment ( control arm ) follow recommendation addition use silver leaf nylon dressing ( experimental arm ) . Randomisation stratify delivery prior chemotherapy radiotherapy fractionation schedule ( extend versus standard ) .</detailed_description>
