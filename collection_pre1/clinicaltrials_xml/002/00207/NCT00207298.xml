	<detailed_description>1.0 Background &amp; Introduction In general , diagnostic image address two issue : structure function . One either view structure body image anatomy use structural image modality plain film radiography ( X-ray ) , Computerized Tomography ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , one view chemical process image biochemistry function use biochemical imaging modality Planar Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography ( SPECT ) image Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) . The strength biochemical imaging method distinguish tissue accord metabolism rather structure . 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) commonly use tracer PET imaging ; use safety well establish world wide . The 18F-FDG injected intravenously transport blood tissue manner similar glucose . It understand 5o year , cancer cell , general , increase glucose uptake anaerobic metabolism compare normal tissue . Like glucose , FDG take cell glucose transport protein ( GLUT ) phosphorylated hexokinase FDG-6-phosphate . However , since FDG-6-phosphate substrate subsequent glucose metabolic pathway low membrane permeability , FDG-6-phosphate become trap tissue proportion rate glycolysis . This accumulation 18F-FDG-6-phosphate form basis tumor metabolic image PET . 2.0 Indications Cancer treatment outcome depend largely accurate diagnosis stag disease . There extensive data literature indicate importance PET image accurately characterize disease , determine stage site recurrent disease many cancer type . For indication , well documented literature functional imaging PET exceed sensitivity , specificity accuracy conventional 3-D imaging modality . The widely cite reference efficacy PET imaging : A Tabulated Summary FDG PET Literature , publish Gambhir et al , JNM ( 2001 ) 42 : 1S-93S . In study average FDG PET sensitivity specificity across oncology application estimate 84 % ( base 18,402 patient study ) 88 % ( base 14,264 patient study ) , respectively . The average management change across application estimate 30 % ( base 5,062 patient ) . Data obtain combine 419 total article abstract study FDG PET use . Various method analysis apply data , reveal small amount variation ratio value . Specifically , sensitivity PET range 84 - 87 % , specificity range 88 % - 93 % , accuracy range 87 - 90 % . In United States , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve 18F-FDG use cancer type . On January 28 , 2005 Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) announce would reimburse PET image study perform almost previously non-covered oncology indication . All previous PET coverage remain fully effect , initial stag cervical cancer add without condition coverage expand conditionally include cancer non-covered indication except breast cancer diagnosis regional lymph node staging .

With population base 4 million people , standardized cancer treatment protocol , evidence-based guideline PET imaging , BCCA position make important contribution define role PET Canadian health care system . 4.0 Study Design This phase III open label study design additional safety data collect first patient scan first three batch 18F-FDG delivered clinical site . Data collect refer physician respect PET scan result affect patient management result PET scan correlate biopsy result available . All subject inform anticipated effect ( none ) purpose inject substance . There intent change way protocol conduct way alter effect purpose injected tracer . Subjects approach respect willingness participate propose study base clinical criterion undergo brief clinical assessment follow scan outline . 5.0 Study Time-Frame The B.C . Cancer Agency anticipate start date June 2005 potential completion date August 2007 , time on-site ( Vancouver Cancer Centre ) radiopharmacy cyclotron operational . Two year data collection provide meaningful number analysis support 18F-FDG New Drug Submission ( NDS ) Health Canada . 6.0 Patient Population Sample Size A total 5,000 patient enter study . This number base anticipated number PET scan referral base criterion study inclusion outline clinical capacity 12 14 patient per day operate 220 day per year . This publicly funded PET program province British Columbia . A sample size 5,000 patient allow PET program BC operate Phase B Functional Imaging Program implement BCCA position submit NDS 18F-FDG . Assuming response rate 90 % patient management survey change patient management 30 % study participant , precision 95 % confidence interval estimate proportion .013 . Given response rate change patient management proportion , tumour site 100 patient yield precision .089 95 % confidence interval . A sensitivity ( specificity accuracy ) rate 80 % estimate full sample precision .011 95 % confidence interval , precision .080 sub-sample 100 . Additional safety data collect first patient image first three batch FDG deliver clinical site ( N=3 ) . The chemical structure product identical authentic FDG . We perform minimum five consecutive 18F-FDG production quality control pass do many course CTA review process . The safety record FDG PET worldwide undisputable expect number adverse event study zero . In addition baseline assessment , subject blood pressure , oxygen saturation , heart rate temperature monitor every 15 minute 2 hour post-procedure . Patients question general well-being scan . If concern patient ' health status change immediately follow scan , physician provide detail assessment . Each three patient follow telephone , usually day scan help insure delay effect . These whole body PET scan image review independently two Nuclear Medicine physicians confirm expect biodistribution radioactivity . If subject experience reaction post-injection could immediately attribute another condition exposure , biodistribution FDG normal tissue alter could explain clinical ground ( eg . patient G-CSF ) , tracer would re-examine tested impurity pyrogen . The safety data collect three patient verify FDG produce BCCA behaving expect . Patients consider appropriate participation protocol drawn population make follow parameter : - Patients age 19 90 year , although exception number may make depend individual 's ability understand , give assent/consent , tolerate procedure . Health Canada expect separate CTA submission BCCA within next month FDG-PET indication pediatric oncology population . - Patients female male race preference group another . - Patients suspect previously diagnose cancer meet BCCA evidence-based guideline FDG-PET . 7.0 Inclusion Criteria - Must resident British Columbia , Canada - Age 19 year old . - ECOG performance status 0 - 3 . - Able provide write informed consent . - Referred treating physician . - Must meet BCCA Evidence-Based guideline FDG-PET Oncology - Patients must able tolerate physical/logistical requirement complete PET scan include lie flat 45 minute tolerate intravenous cannulation injection . 8.0 Exclusion Criteria - Patients ' blood glucose &gt; 11.1 mmol/L ( 200 mg/dL ) measure glucometer immediately prior scan . - Pregnancy . - Patients unable provide inform consent . - Patients medically unstable eg . acute cardiac respiratory distress , hypotensive - Patients exceed safe weight limit PET/CT bed ( 204.5 kg ) fit PET/CT bore ( diameter 70 cm ) .</detailed_description>
