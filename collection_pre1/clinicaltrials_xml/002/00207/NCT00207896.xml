	<detailed_description>Neuroendocrine dysfunction abnormality production release certain hormone . Studies complete adult patient show abnormal hormone level critical illness contribute long patient stay intensive care unit , severe illness whether survive . In child hormone produce differently different function . Depending particular illness question hormonal dysfunction may grave clinical consequence . Thus far , study examine neuroendocrine dysfunction child . The aim study identify common hormone responses child , identify connection hormone level outcome ( likelihood child stay intensive care unit multiple day , etc. ) . To explore aim draw blood critically ill patient admit pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) check various hormone level . Only patient require blood sample part admission blood test certain hormone level . No change make establish standard care patient 's particular critical illness . The study design examine hormone response critical illness identify connection hormone level severity illness . Based lab value intend lay foundation study may clearly explain role hormone critically ill child , possibly introduction hormone replacement critical illness .</detailed_description>
