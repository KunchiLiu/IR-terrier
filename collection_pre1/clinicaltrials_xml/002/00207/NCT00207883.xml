	<brief_summary>The purpose study see fast accurate two different technique use physician insert catheter child . Catheters tiny tube carry fluid , blood sometimes liquid food person 's vein . The technique currently use relies physical landmark use finger feel anatomy place catheter vein artery . The investigator change technique use ultrasound patient 's bedside help physician place catheter blood vessel . They compare use two method determine fast require few needle stick .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In critically ill patient , central venous access essential volume resuscitation , administration medicine ( vasoactive drug , antibiotic chemotherapy ) , administration blood product , hemodynamic monitoring . Placement central venous catheter ( CVC ) occur commonly 200,000 CVCs place adult child yearly . At Egleston 222 central venous line place last year 178 CVCs YTD October . Obtaining central venous access critically ill child difficult procedure many potential complication . These complication include , limited , hematoma site , hemothorax , pneumothorax , need change site , injury surround structure . The complication rate CVCs child report anywhere 2.5 % 22 % . All frequently CVC placement child unsuccessful anywhere 5 % time great 19 % . Studies adult show ultrasound guided central venous access decrease number attempt require cannulate vein . Ultrasound ( US ) guidance also able decrease time require cannulate vessel . A meta analysis ultrasound guide central venous access adult conclude internal jugular procedure ultrasound guidance significantly successful landmark technique alone . With recent focus patient safety clinical outcome American College Emergency Physicians publish policy statement include guideline use US guidance central venous access list primary application ultrasound emergency department . Evidence US guidance child currently find mainly anesthesia literature . The 2003 NICE sponsor meta-analysis show overall relative risk reduction 85 % fail placement 73 % complication internal jugular placement pediatric patient operate room . Because small sample size ( &lt; 100 patient ) internal jugular approach study , definitive conclusion regard site ongoing . Currently prospective study evaluate use ultrasound guide central venous access child pediatric intensive care unit . Also , study address use US guide CVC placement femoral access , major site use child , also lack . Our proposal prove US guide CVC decrease overall time require cannulate vessel increase probability successful cannulation first operator , decrease number skin puncture obtain access , eliminate need change sit access , improve probability access . Additionally believe US guide CVC placement would decrease likelihood untoward effect include limited severe hematoma require attempt additional site , inadvertent puncture wrong vessel , hemothorax/pneumothorax .</detailed_description>
