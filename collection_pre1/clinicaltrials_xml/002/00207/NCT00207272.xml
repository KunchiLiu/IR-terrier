	<detailed_description>In preliminary phase , total 12 obese patient accept undergo gastric restrictive surgery recruit . Although inclusion criterion secondary companion pilot study include diabetic patient , diabetes mellitus necessary test hypothesis preliminary phase . The aim test whether subcutaneous adipose tissue abdominal region similar visceral omental adipose tissue term cellular mechanism ingestion MCT oil . Twelve obese patient approve gastric bypass surgery randomize either receive MCT-based LCT-based liquid diet 4 week period . These diet identical except quality fat . The intervention double-blinded . Six patient receive daily diet consist 5 liquid meal use HMR 800 meal replacement product ( Health Management Resources , Inc ; 160 calories/shake ) 44.5 gram MCT oil ( Life Enhancement Products , Inc. , Petaluna , CA ; 8.3 kcal/gm ) add .

Patients group see weekly registered dietitian physician . Blood pressure weight record , adverse event note cared appropriate . Dietary instruction review need . Both diet 1170-1870 kcal/day , consist 36 % CHO , 26.2 % protein , 37.6 % fat . The MCT diet contain 30.2 % total calorie MCT oil . The percentage give base shake oil consumption ( 1170 kcal/day ) . The remainder diet vary accord patient ' selection list permit food , additional 700 kcal/day ( total 1870 kcal/day ) . Subjects receive multi-vitamin day . Subjects also receive two Fibercon capsule per day prevent possible bowel change associate full liquid diet . It estimate patient lose 10 30 pound surgery . This standard care patient encourage lose amount prior surgery . This small amount weight loss initial body weight consider beneficial reduce complication gastric bypass surgery morbidly obese patient significant co-morbidities . During surgery , biopsies visceral omental adipose tissue , well subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue , obtain . Tissue analyze determine mRNA level key enzyme fatty acid esterification , lipolysis , oxidative disposition . This preliminary phase conduct determine whether visceral , omental , subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue behave similarly expose MCT-based dietIn Phase 1 2 , result use extrapolate effect visceral omental adipose tissue effect see subcutaneous adipose tissue . In addition , small sample tissue ( approximately .25 cm x .25cm ) 12 subject ship Quantomix , sample view electron microscopy . There additional tissue remove OR , add risk subject . Quantomix receive identifying information sample ; therefore breach confidentiality . STUDY PROCEDURES : Screening Preliminary Phase Twelve obese subject recruit Nutrition Weight Management Center population gastric restrictive surgery patient . The subject meet requirement receive prior approval gastric restrictive surgery . The patient sign IRB-approved Informed Consent - Surgical Intervention form Baseline visit . Inclusion criterion include age 18-65 year BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 &gt; 35 kg/m2 co-morbidities . Exclusions part normal standard care pre-selection process approval surgery , clinically severe lactose intolerance , alcohol dependence , significant egg allergy . Baseline Remaining Visits The Baseline visit within two week screen visit . For procedure perform baseline weekly visit , see Table A attach . Procedure subcutaneous adipose tissue needle biopsy The surgeon remove three piece fat tissue measure 2 inch x 2 inch x 2 inch fat skin gastric restrictive surgery . In surgical field , appropriate remove large piece tissue order able extrapolate define much tissue require remove punch biopsy Phase 1 2 secondary companion study ( secondary companion study , expect 100 mg subcutaneous tissue yield 3 microgram total RNA . The amount tissue remove surgery great amount ensure project yield ) . The surgeon also remove two piece fat tissue abdomen surgery . In total , one piece take fat tissue cover stomach ( omental ) , one piece skin ( subcutaneous ) , piece fat tissue cover bowel intestine ( visceral ) . These fat tissue area surgery perform . The biopsy interfere way surgery . The surgeon also draw sample blood ( 12 mL ) use hematology , serum chemistry , hemoglobin A1C , serum lipid , thyroid function test , serum insulin , serum hydroxybutyrate ( possibly elevate MCT-fed subject ) , serum leptin , serum free fatty acid concentration . The surgeon explain subject prior surgery . Study schedule : Pre-Op Diet : 1 . Prior gastric restrictive surgery , eligible patient receive dietary instruction register dietitian daily diet consist 5 liquid meal use HMR 800 meal replacement product ( Health Management Resources , Inc. ) 44.5 gram MCT oil 41 gram LCT oil add . Patients group give list supplemental food suitable study . They may choose eat additional 700 kcal per day list ask complete food record monitor caloric intake . Depending much food patient eats , daily caloric intake approximately 1170-1870 calorie . All patient instruct refrain alcohol intake study . 2 . All patient undergo gastric bypass surgery 4 week MCT oil/HMR LCT oil/HMR . Post-Op Diet : Following surgery , subject follow usual standard care implement Nutrition Weight Management Clinic post-operative visit surgeon register dietitian . Diet Stages Following Gastric Restrictive Surgery attach hereto Appendix A. Biopsy Procedure : 1.During gastric restrictive surgery , biopsies visceral omental adipose tissue well subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue obtain . The surgeon remove three piece fat tissue measure 2 inch x 2 inch x 2 inch fat skin gastric restrictive surgery . In surgical field , appropriate remove large piece tissue order able extrapolate define much tissue require remove punch biopsy Phase 1 2 secondary companion study ( In secondary companion study , expect 100 mg subcutaneous tissue yield 3 microgram total RNA . The amount tissue remove surgery great amount ensure project yield ) . The surgeon also remove two piece fat tissue abdomen surgery . In total , one piece take fat tissue cover stomach ( omental ) , one piece skin ( subcutaneous ) , piece fat tissue cover bowel intestine ( visceral ) . These fat tissue area surgery perform . The biopsy interfere way surgery . The surgeon also draw sample blood use hematology , serum chemistry , hemoglobin A1C , serum lipid , thyroid function test , serum insulin , serum hydroxybutyrate ( possibly elevate MCT-fed subject ) , serum leptin , serum free fatty acid concentration . The surgeon explain subject prior surgery . Screening period ( 2 week ) 1 . Prior Screening visit , pre-operative visit , Preliminary Phase explain patient pre-approved gastric restrictive surgery . Questions answer time . 2 . Initial screen form complete 3 . Pre-approval gastric restrictive surgery document . 4 . IRB-approved write consent form , sign pre-operative visit surgeon co-investigator medical co-investigator document . 5 . Patient schedule return Baseline visit eligible study . Baseline ( within 2 week screen ) Â± 4 day . Beginning study within 2-3 week screen visit . 1 . Fasting blood sample obtain hematology , serum chemistry , hemoglobin A1C , serum lipid , thyroid function test , serum insulin , serum hydroxybutyrate ( possibly elevate MCT-fed subject ) , serum leptin , serum free fatty acid concentration . 2 . Weight blood pressure record . 3 . Study diet instruction dispense . 4 . Patient schedule surgery end Week 4 study diet . Weekly visit ( registered dietitian physician ) 1 . Weight blood pressure record . 2 . Dietary instruction review necessary . 3 . Adverse effect note . 4 . Study diet dispense need . 5 . At visit dietitian physician one day gastric bypass surgery , blood sample obtain hematology , serum chemistry , hemoglobin A1C , serum lipid , thyroid function test , serum insulin , serum hydroxybutyrate ( possibly elevate MCT-fed subject ) , serum leptin , serum free fatty acid concentration . Unscheduled visit ( UV ) : If necessary patient safety , unscheduled visit may arrange . Unscheduled source document set use visit attend routine patient visit label last attended visit number follow decimal point number unscheduled visit ( i.e . two unscheduled visit attend Week 0 Week 1 unscheduled visit would label unscheduled visit set 0.1 0.2 chronological order ) . At unscheduled visit follow shall complete indicated : - Blood sample collect laboratory evaluation , clinically indicate . - Adverse event document . - A physical examination perform , clinically indicate . - An ECG perform , clinically indicate .</detailed_description>
