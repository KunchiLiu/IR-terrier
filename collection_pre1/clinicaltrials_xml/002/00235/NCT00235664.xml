	<brief_summary>Infections cause multidrug resistant bacteria become prevalent many tertiary care academic center . These infection associate increased morbidity mortality . The initial empiric antibiotic choice may adequate delay initiate appropriate therapy reason poorer outcome . Furthermore , uncommonly therapeutic option available associate significant toxicity . This particular challenge solid organ transplant recipient , immunosuppressed high risk acquire infection . Exposure different class antibiotic link development antibiotic resistance . Determining risk factor acquisition drug-resistant bacteria molecular mechanism resistance occurs would allow development implementation strategy minimize infection therefore improve outcome . We , researcher University Pittsburgh , aim collect surveillance culture patient undergo liver , intestinal multivisceral transplantation order determine prevalence risk factor Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ) , extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases ( ESBL ) -Klebsiella methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , well determine molecular mechanism associate development resistance P. aeruginosa .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Drug Resistant Pathogens Among Liver , Intestinal Multivisceral Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Day 1 patient admit Transplant intensive care unit ( ICU ) follow liver , intestinal multivisceral transplantation . Stool sample ( case patient rectal bags and/or diarrhea ) cefotaxime-resistant Gram negative rod would obtain within 24 hour admission ICU weekly thereafter discharge hospital isolation MDR P. aeruginosa ESBL- K. pneumoniae , whichever occur first . While patient intubate , endotracheal aspirate would also obtain weekly basis . Nasal swabs MRSA would obtain within 24 hour admission ICU weekly thereafter discharge hospital isolation MRSA , whichever come first . If bowel movement day stool collect , rectal swab obtain . In addition , endotracheal tube pull , endotracheal aspirate obtain . Samples obtain available . If swab obtain day 1 positive organism study , sample obtain . No pregnancy test occur since potential patient undergo transplant must pregnant . Pregnant woman , woman currently breast-feeding infant , allow take part study . Once drug-resistant organism ( MDR P. aeruginosa , ESBL K. pneumoniae and/or MRSA ) isolate , skin swab groin subclavian area obtain . No swab obtain patient he/she follow clinically determine impact organism patient 's clinical outcome . Cultures obtain discretion treat physician review P. aeruginosa , ESBL-K. pneumoniae MRSA isolate , collect diagnostic microbiology laboratory store Dr. Paterson 's laboratory analysis molecular mechanism resistance . These sample would discard identification susceptibility test complete diagnostic lab . The following information also collect : demographic data ( address , date birth , etc . ) include age , sex , height , weight , state birth , previous report associate participant 's condition , laboratory result , current medication use , prior medical problems/history , history prior admission , reason transplantation , history prior transplantation , immunosuppression use , antimicrobial receive , surgery perform , duration mechanical ventilation , requirement dialysis , microbiological study available , simplify acute physiologic score ( SAPS ) admission , duration ICU stay . This information obtain medical record and/or subject become part research record . The patient see inpatient University Pittsburgh Medical Center visit take approximately 30 minute . The patient see member research team . Sample storage organism The biologic sample control principal investigator research project . To protect confidentiality , personal identifier ( i.e. , name , social security number , birth date ) remove ( de-identified ) replace specific code number . The information link code number correspond subject ' identity keep separate , secure location . The investigator study keep sample indefinitely . All sample provide de-identified . If subject withdraws provide request writing , sample collect already process destroy . All sample keep Dr Paterson 's laboratory Scaife Hall , Room 812 , 3550 Terrace Street , Pittsburgh , PA . The patient complete study patient discharge hospital . Laboratory method : Swabs P. aeruginosa ESBL-K. pneumoniae plant cetrimide agar nutrient agar supplement cefotaxime , vancomycin amphotericin B. Antimicrobial susceptibility test perform use disk diffusion test E-test . ESBL screen perform use double disk diffusion test E-test cefotaxime-cefotaxime/clavulanic acid ceftazidime-ceftazidime/clavulanic acid . Swabs MRSA plant chromogenic medium selective MRSA . In order study molecular mechanism responsible development antimicrobial resistance among P. aeruginosa isolates , quantitative real-time PCR gene encode common efflux pump , PCR mutation quinolone resistance determine region gyrA , gyrB parC gene PCR beta-lactamase perform . Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) perform isolates single patient , determine isolates genotypically similar . PFGE also do MDR P. aeruginosa isolates order determine belong single multiple clone within ICU .</detailed_description>
