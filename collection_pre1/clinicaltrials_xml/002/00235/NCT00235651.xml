	<brief_summary>The purpose study quantify dose aerosol medication deposit lung lung transplant recipient receive single nebulized treatment aerosolize Abelcet® ( lipid complexed amphotericin-B ) . This study perform determine range deposit dos pattern distribution could expect population ultimate efficacy preparation evaluate . A radioisotope technique utilized track medication dose . The study include 12 subject perform one test session last approximately 3 hour . An Investigational New Drug Application ( IND ) detail protocol submit principal investigator ( PI ) approve Food Drug Administration [ FDA ] ( 72,521 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abelcet Radiotagging Protocol : Inhaled Lipid Complex Abelcet® Lung Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Methods : The patient need complete one visit take 3 hour time . All test perform Nuclear Medicine Department locate first floor Presbyterian Hospital . Screening : 1 . For woman could possibly pregnant , small amount urine use pregnancy test perform study day prior drug delivery . Pregnant woman , woman currently breast-feeding infant , allow take part study . 2 . Patients ask question take five minute one investigator study coordinator . These question include information past medical history , surgical date , medication , etc . The patient 's medical record review demographic information ( age , sex , race ) , lab result ( standard post transplant care ) , medication information , well testing/procedures undergone . Experimental Procedures : 1 . Fifteen minute prior administration radiolabeled Abelcet® nebulizer , measure ass blood pressure heart rate , ass lung sound , perform pulmonary function test , re-verify subject know allergy previous adverse experience radiopharmaceutical . Female subject receive urine pregnancy test day testing , prior drug administration . 2 . Subjects seat head dual-head gamma camera region top head stomach viewable device depicts radioactivity inside body . Subjects inhale test aerosol . The aerosol deliver use Aeroeclipse breath actuate Nebulizer driven DeVilbiss 8650D compressor set 40psig . The anterior head gamma camera move away subject aerosol administration , image perform posterior head throughout drug delivery . Drug delivery take approximately 25 minute . 3 . When nebulized dose completely deliver nebulizer associate equipment remove room , anterior head gamma camera bring back close proximity subject . A series 30 image take depict drug deposit subject . The first 4 image take manually high-pixel resolution . The camera set automatically acquire image next 20 minute low resolution . 4 . Radioactivity use analog drug dose . The start dose radioactivity add nebulizer compare dose find nebulizer exhalation filter dose delivery , order determine total dose deposit . The regional breakdown deposit dose determine use gamma camera image . 5 . While camera head still close proximity subject , small amount Xenon [ Xe-133 ] gas administer subject via mask shape lung depict imaged . This gas wash absorbent filter . The gas inhalation take approximately 6 minute . 6 . After completion imaging ( approximately 30 minute drug administration ) subject move small exam room blood pressure , heart rate , lung sound reassess . Pulmonary function test re-performed change force expiratory volume 1 second [ FEV1 ] ( ) cause drug determine . Subjects treat bronchodilator exam reveals sign bronchoconstriction result aerosol . In addition , adverse event monitor record . Monitoring/Follow Up : Each participant undergo follow monitoring procedure evaluate effectiveness safety experimental procedure part standard medical care . 1 . The monitoring/follow-up procedure include follow-up phone call study coordinator check side effect experimental procedure . This call take place day participant complete experimental procedure . This call take longer 5-10 minute complete . 2 . Thirty day participant complete experimental procedure , study coordinator call participant check side effect associate experimental procedure . This call take longer 5-10 minute complete . After phone call patient complete study . Rationale Follow-Up : The half-life radiopharmaceutical [ Technetium ( Tc-99m ) ] use label drug 6.02 hour . The serum half-life amphotericin intravenous ( IV ) Abelcet administration order 170 hour ( Abelcet label ) . Detectable concentration Amphotericin find BAL fluid lung 192 hour post administration inhale Abelcet previous study . The long half-life associate active medication necessitates longer follow period .</detailed_description>
