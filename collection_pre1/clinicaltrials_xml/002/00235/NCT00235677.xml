	<brief_summary>Aim : To evaluate therapeutic efficacy therapeutic procedure , involve endoscopic suturing , gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) compare sham procedure . The hypothesis test study active treatment would : 1 ) decrease use antisecretory medication , 2 ) decrease GERD symptom , 3 ) improve quality life , 4 ) reduce esophageal acid exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease By Endoscopic Fundoplication , A Placebo-Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) chronic , often lifelong , use antisecretory medication great clinical economical implication patient , practice physician society general . The currently available medication GERD effective heartburn , less symptom regurgitation . Surgical antireflux treatment offer good alternative . The current surgical approach , laparoscopic fundoplication , safe effective ( 90 % reduction use antireflux medication ) , significant subgroup patient new symptom arise ( dysphagia , bloat ) perioperative morbidity , well financial cost relatively high . An endoscopic suture system develop , offer minimally invasive antireflux treatment , perform outpatient setting . The procedure aim create endoscopic fundoplication , could possibly serve alternative antireflux medication surgery . Recent , uncontrolled study , show result endoscopic suture system satisfactory procedure safe . This single-center , double-blinded , randomize , sham-controlled trial conduct evaluate efficacy endoscopic gastroplication Endocinch suture system . Sixty patient daily symptom GERD abnormal esophageal 24-hr pH monitoring randomly assign three endoscopic gastroplications ( n = 20 ) , sham procedure ( n = 20 ) observation ( n = 20 ) . Primary endpoint proton pump inhibitor use GERD symptom . Secondary endpoint quality life , 24-hr esophageal acid exposure , esophageal manometry occurrence adverse event . Follow-up assessment perform 3 month . The research nurse patient active sham group blind procedure assignment .</detailed_description>
