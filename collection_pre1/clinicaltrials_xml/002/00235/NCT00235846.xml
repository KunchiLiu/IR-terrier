	<brief_summary>Conventional open vein harvest legs coronary artery bypass surgery result wound complication among 30 % patient . Endoscopic harvest decrease complication rate , remain show whether also fact among patient short segment veingraft material need leg . We hypothesise rate wound complication reduce patient satisfaction increase also among patient short vein segment endoscopically harvest compare conventional open vein harvesting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Conventional open vein harvest legs coronary artery bypass surgery result wound complication among 30 % patient . Endoscopic harvest decrease complication rate , remain show whether also fact among patient short segment veingraft material need leg . We hypothesise rate wound complication reduce patient satisfaction increase also among patient short vein segment endoscopically harvest compare conventional open vein harvest . Preoperative demographic well as peri- postoperative data collect prospectively 5-7 day 1 month postoperatively . Wound complication register well post operative pain wound evaluate use af visual analogue scale . Patients evaluate cosmetic result wound heal .</detailed_description>
