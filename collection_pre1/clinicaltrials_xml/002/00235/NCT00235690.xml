	<brief_summary>More 80 patient University Pittsburgh Medical Center infect Pseudomonas aeruginosa , lack susceptibility commercially available antibiotic except `` colistin '' . This antibiotic develop 1960s preliminary pharmacokinetic study perform time . Dosing recommendation , basis pharmacokinetic study , list drug 's product information . However , dose recommendation patient require renal replacement therapy ( either intermittent hemodialysis continuous venovenous hemofiltration ) . Furthermore , science antibiotic dosing ( `` pharmacodynamics '' ) change significantly since 1960s quite possible dose recommendation list product information optimal . Furthermore , even though physician refer `` colistin '' administration , intravenous form drug colistin methanesulfonate ( CMS ) . CMS convert body colistin . Both CMS colistin different pharmacokinetic antimicrobial activity . For reason , , investigator University Pittsburgh , perform pilot study pharmacokinetics intravenous CMS/colistin patient require antibiotic clinical purpose . Plasma concentration determine around CMS/colistin dose drug reach steady state . Concentrations pulmonary epithelial lining fluid also determine patient pneumonia . Microbiologic clinical endpoint determine correlated concentration . The measurement CMS colistin level determine laboratory Australia develop assay . A submission make National Institutes Health ( NIH ) funding multicenter study address research question great sample size . The study propose pilot study order prove feasibility research approach provide preliminary data NIH proposal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At baseline ( upon sign informed consent ) , follow information collect : Demographic data - age , sex , height , weight , state birth , underlie illness , underlie infection , immunosuppression , antibiotic use , laboratory result , current medication use , prior medical problems/history clinical outcome . The research coordinator contact patient day 14 , 28 90 day infection determine clinical outcome . If patient still inpatient research coordinator visit patient hospital room evaluate patient 's health status . This visit take 10 minute . If patient discharge hospital , patient contact telephone research coordinator determine health status , recent electronic medical record exist . This telephone contact take 10 minute . Blood work microbiologic sample collect : Collection six sample 3 mL blood third fourth day colistin therapy occur . These sample collect : - immediately pre-dose , - end colistin infusion , - 30 minute end colistin infusion , - 60 minute end colistin infusion , - 4 hour end colistin infusion , - 12 hour end colistin infusion ( immediately prior next dose drug give every 12 hour ) . Indwelling venous arterial access line , already place , utilized pharmacological study 's blood draw . Rationale : The sample utilized quantification plasma level colistin . Collection microbiologic sample within 48-96 hour initiation colistin therapy . These sample two set blood culture patient bacteremia , mini-BAL quantitative bacterial culture patient pneumonia cerebrospinal fluid collection patient Gram negative meningitis cerebrospinal fluid drain situ . Additionally , sample use determine concentration colistin CMS site infection . A 3mL blood sample take time specimen collection determine concomitant serum concentration colistin CMS . Rationale : These sample use determine rapid bacteriologic clearance infection determine concentration drug site infection . The blood sample process stored -80Â° C freezer secure laboratory supervision principal investigator . These sample send laboratory Drs Jian Li Roger Nation Melbourne , Australia , determine amount colistin CMS reach participant 's blood follow dose administration . All sample send de-identified . All sample analyze obtain amount colistin CMS find blood . The biologic sample control principal investigator research project . To protect confidentiality , personal identifier ( i.e. , name , social security number , birth date ) remove ( de-identified ) replace specific code number . The information link code number correspond subject ' identity keep separate , secure location . The investigator study keep sample indefinitely . All sample send outside UPMC facility de-identified . If subject withdraws provide request writing , sample collect already process destroy . All sample UPMC keep investigator 's laboratory locate Scaife Hall , Room 812 , 3550 Terrace Street . All patient see UPMC facility inpatient . Other item collect study purpose : Microbiology - organism caused infection sub-cultured clinical microbiology laboratory ( diagnosis obtain since microbiology lab would otherwise destroy culture ) provide investigator . All subsequent Gram negative bacterial isolates sub-cultured store similar purpose . An unopened vial colistin batch use patient collect analysis , actual dose colistin calculate .</detailed_description>
