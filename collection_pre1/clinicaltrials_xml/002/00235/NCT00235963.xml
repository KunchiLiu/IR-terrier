	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double-Blind , Placebo-Controlled Trial Simvastatin Subarachnoid Hemorrhage-Induced Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mortality rate aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) approach 50 % within 1st 24 hour ictus . Patients survive subsequently develop progressive vasospasm large cerebral artery , major cause morbidity mortality . Vasospasm vary severity , small portion patient vasospasm develop clinical sign symptom . Patients severe vasospasm prone develop ischemic deficit , , untreated , progress ischemic infarct . The mechanisms vasospasm subject intense investigation . Nitric oxide ( NO ) -cGMP system attract particular attention . Under normal physiological condition , NO synthesize endothelia NO synthase ( eNOS ) stimulate vascular smooth muscle cGMP production , turn cause smooth muscle relaxation . Vasospasm impair endothelium-dependent dilation , suggest SAH induces state NO deficiency within cerebral artery . There several potential mechanism NO deficiency . Hemoglobin potent scavenger NO , apply extraluminal bind NO inhibits action . Presence perivascular hemoglobin may contribute development vasospasm reduce availability NO . It show adventitial applied hemoglobin inhibit basal NO activity vivo adventitial exposure whole blood lead reduction basal cGMP level association vasospasm cerebral artery . Similarly , superoxide also react NO act NO scavenger . Superoxide production increase SAH , may part responsible inhibition NO-dependent vasodilation . Free radical scavenger manipulation reduce free radical formation reduce vasospasm SAH . NOS constitutively express endothelium adventitial perivascular nerve fiber . SAH-induced vasospasm monkey associate diminished constitutive NOS immunoreactivity perivascular nerve around spastic artery . Endothelial NOS mRNA also decrease monkey cerebral artery 7d SAH . Therefore , data suggest relative reduction NO synthesis SAH , addition increase breakdown . In summary , reduction NO tonus around cerebral artery induce decreased expression endothelial NOS well increase NO scavenger substance subarachnoid space , relative resistance NO-induced vasodilation SAH appear one key event development vasospasm . Therefore , therapeutic intervention enhance endothelial NO production may compensate change reverse reduce vasospasm . Statins FDA approve mainly antihyperlipidemics , effectively reduce risk stroke myocardial infarction . Simvastatin also FDA-approved stroke prevention . The risk reduction , however , correlate degree lipid reduction , see even individual normal lipid level . Statins also cerebroprotective stroke . They enhance endothelium-dependent relaxation , augment cerebral blood flow , reduce cerebral infarct size , improve neurological outcome stroke normocholesterolemic animal . Their protective effect independent lipid reduction . Most importantly , statin upregulate endothelial NOS expression . This turn improve cerebral blood flow reduces infarct size experimental model . In addition , statin treatment enhance endothelial fibrinolytic action , inhibit platelet aggregation . Therefore , statins excellent candidate test SAH-induced vasospasm . This study randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled design . The anticipated enrollment 104 patient , 52 simvastatin , 52 placebo group , recruit studied MGH . Assuming difference 27 % , power study 88 % , alpha=0.05 . Inclusion exclusion criterion summarize . Once enrolled , patient randomize Research Pharmacy staff receive either placebo , simvastatin 80 mg every day , high clinically use dose simvastatin . We choose dose maximize effect endothelium , dose dependent experimental study . The study investigator blind treatment group . Patients follow prospectively receive standard aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage care . The data collect pertains development vasospasm , hence involves daily vital sign , neurologic examination , routine neuroimaging . The development vasospasm determine base daily transcranial Doppler study , conventional angiography ( routinely do within 7 day subarachnoid hemorrhage standard care ) , neurologic examination . Liver function test along total CPK check admission week long drug continue , screen potential toxicity medication . Medication discontinue CPK liver enzymes elevate 3 time upper limit normal range . CPK elevation due surgical percutaneous/endovascular intervention , cardiac source ( i.e . accompany troponin elevation without ECG change ) , consider indication drug discontinuation .</detailed_description>
