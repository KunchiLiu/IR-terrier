	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate possible neurotoxic effect party-drug Ecstasy ( MDMA ) brain brain function human . Main research question concern causality , course clinical relevance neurotoxicity ecstasy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The NeXT Study ; The Netherlands XTC Toxicity Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aim investigate causality , course clinical relevance observe neurotoxicity het human brain among user popular recreational drug 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) . Studies animals non-human primate suggest MDMA toxic toward brain serotonin neuron dose overlap use human . Much less known effect drug human brain . Recent study , however , suggest MDMA might also neurotoxic 5-HT neuron human , associate functional consequence , memory impairment depression . However , study retrospective potentially vulnerable selection bias confound . Clearly , prospective study ascertain recreational XTC neurotoxic human . However , give exist data study ethically acceptable . In present project , therefore , choose naturalistic study use combination prospective retrospective approach : prospective study among 200 XTC naive subject high-risk profile first XTC use two-year follow 50 incident- , 50 continuously XTC naive subject , retrospective design 25 subject 25 subject without prior exposure XTC select large representative cohort ( N=1600 ) prospectively follow age 12 . In addition , cross sectional design use 70 subject variation type amount drug use , besides history frequent XTC use . Among 50 incident case sample 50 continuously XTC-naive subject prospective cohort , indicator neurotoxicity ( SPECT,1H-MRS ) , marker neuronal injury ( fMRI , Perfusion MRI ) , clinical assessment memory , mood personality prior XTC use compare parameter two year later , i.e . XTC user take place incident case . In retrospective cohort , subject lifetime XTC exposure compare XTC naive subject neurotoxicity , neural injury psychopathology parameter , control potential confounders assess prior first use XTC . In cross sectional cohort , subject assess neurotoxicity , neural injury psychopathology parameter , control confound effect use psychoactive drug besides XTC . The combined result result conclusion validly use prevention message , clinical decision making development op national XTC policy .</detailed_description>
