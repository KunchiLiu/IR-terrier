	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic inflammatory disorder airway . The inflammation associate bronchial hyperresponsiveness , airflow obstruction , respiratory symptom include wheezing , cough chest tightness . Inhaled corticosteroid effective controller asthma medication . They indicate management persistent asthma level severity . They document improve symptom pulmonary function reduce exacerbation , need quick-relief medication airway hyperresponsiveness . Despite benefit , inhale corticosteroid associate adverse local effect . These include oral candidiasis dysphonia . However , though risk report , carefully study . The incidence oral candidiasis newly treat subject onset within carefully monitor timeframe adequately assess . A overtly undesirable effect dysphonia . Data usually collect spontaneous report patient clinical trial . However , awareness dysphonia require certain degree subjective discomfort initiate report . Subjective awareness dysphonia often vary base individual voice requirement . A singer , example , usually acutely aware minor voice change contrast someone depend voice quality . Nonetheless , voice abnormality probably occur similar frequency patient concerned concerned voice due inhaled corticosteroid . New subjective scale report individual â€™ voice recently validate publish area . These scale validate patient asthma subject use inhaled corticosteroid . New technology objective voice assessment also develop permit great ability quantify voice change . These advance permit good measure potential adverse effect inhale corticosteroids voice regard onset abnormality regard magnitude effect . This pilot study initial probe clarify potential inhaled corticosteroid , fluticasone propionate deliver Advair DISKUS device produce oral candidiasis voice change , determine best measurement quantitate objectively effect .</detailed_description>
