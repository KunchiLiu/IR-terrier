	<brief_summary>Supplemental perioperative oxygen report halve double risk surgical wound infection . We test hypothesis supplemental oxygen reduces infection risk follow colorectal surgery . Colorectal surgery patient ( n=300 ) randomly assign 30 % 80 % FiO2 intraoperatively 6 hour postoperatively . Wound infection diagnose blinded investigator use Centers Disease Control criterion . Baseline patient characteristic , anesthetic management , potential confounding factor record . Wound infection rate compare chi-square analysis . Logistic regression identify contribution potential confounding factor . Surgical wound infection occur 24.4 % patient receive 30 % oxygen , 14.9 % receive 80 % oxygen ( P &lt; 0.039 ) . According logistic regression , relative risk infection patient give supplemental oxygen 0.46 ( P=0.035 ) . Supplemental inspired oxygen reduce wound infection risk roughly factor two . We thus recommend supplemental oxygen provide patient undergoing colorectal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supplemental Oxygen Reduces Surgical Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context : Supplemental perioperative oxygen variously report halve double risk surgical wound infection . Objective : We test hypothesis supplemental oxygen reduces infection risk follow colorectal surgery . Design : Randomized , control trial . Setting : Fourteen Spanish hospital . Patients : Three hundred patient undergo elective colorectal surgery . Interventions : Patients randomly assign either 30 % 80 % FiO2 intraoperatively 6 hour surgery . Anesthetic management antibiotic administration standardize . Main outcome measure : Wound infection diagnose blinded investigator use Centers Disease Control criterion . Baseline patient characteristic , anesthetic management , potential confounding factor record . The wound infection rate 30 % 80 % oxygen group compare chi-square analysis . A logistic regression use identify contribution potential confounding factor .</detailed_description>
