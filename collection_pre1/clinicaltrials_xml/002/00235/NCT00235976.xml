	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , control , observer-blinded , dose-response study evaluate efficacy tracheal intubation safety gantacurium chloride injection healthy adult patient undergo surgery general anesthesia . Gantacurium chloride injection ( previously refer AV430A ) new , investigational non-depolarizing ultra-short act neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMB ) . Preliminary result animal healthy human subject ( Phase 1 study adult volunteer ) suggest gantacurium chloride injection may provide useful adjunct general anesthesia permit rapid intubation . This Phase 2 study provide definitive information ultra-short acting profile compound determine quality intubation patient , 60 second , assess blind intubator . In addition , safety compound assess . In study , efficacy safety gantacurium chloride injection also compare reference drug , succinylcholine , placebo . The primary objective study determine dose-response relationship gantacurium chloride injection tracheal intubation condition single rapid bolus intravenous ( i.v . ) dose component propofol/opioid induction-intubation sequence ass safety profile compound .</brief_summary>
