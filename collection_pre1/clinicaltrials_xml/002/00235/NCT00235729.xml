	<brief_summary>The main objective study investigate effectiveness lofexidine reduce withdrawal symptom among subject undergo opiate detoxification . Currently , lofexidine commonly use non-opiate medication detoxification opiates United Kingdom ( UK ) . There non-opiate medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) indication United States ( US ) . The medication currently approve FDA opiate detoxification methadone buprenorphine . These medication , however , potential abuse . Lofexidine , hand , offer unique advantage opiate detoxification addicting , easy use , favorable safety profile .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : The primary objective study investigate efficacy lofexidine hydrochloride , alpha-2-adrenergic agonist , reduce withdrawal symptom subject undergoing opioid detoxification assess 1 ) Day 3 SOWS-Gossop score treatment phase , 2 ) Time dropout treatment phase . Secondary Objectives : Secondary objective include determine Lofexidine 's : 1 ) Efficacy reduction withdrawal symptom subject undergoing opioid detoxification ( assessed longitudinal change SOWS-Gossop , OOWS-Handelsman , VAS-E MGCI ( subject rater ) ; 2 ) Efficacy reduction need concomitant medication alleviate opiate withdrawal symptom : 3 ) Efficacy increase number completers treatment phase ; 4 ) Safety study population . Study Design : This randomize , multi-center , double blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study . There 3 major phase study . During Phase I ( Screening ) screen assessment perform ; Phase II ( Days 1-5 ) , subject admit inpatient unit randomize receive either lofexidine ( 0.8 mg QID ) placebo QID baseline assessment perform prior randomization Day 1 ; Phase III ( Days 6-8 ) , subject receive placebo QID Days 6-7 , discharge Day 8 follow post-treatment assessment . An adaptive randomization procedure use randomly allocate subject one two treatment group - lofexidine placebo . Study Population : 264 subject Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) criteria current dependence opioid half-life similar heroin morphine determine structured clinical interview ( SCID ) randomize one treatment group ( 132 subject per group ) . Subjects least 18 years-of-age positive urine toxicology screen opiates negative methadone , LAM/LAAM , buprenorphine screening , ability understand provide write informed consent meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion may randomize study . Treatments : On Day 1 , subject randomize either lofexidine placebo receive lofexidine ( 0.8 mg [ 4 x 0.2 mg lofexidine tablet ] QID ) placebo ( 4 match placebo tablet QID ) . Lofexidine placebo administer orally within 15 minute 0800 , 1300 , 1800 2300 hour Days 1-5 . On Days 6 7 , subject receive placebo use dose schedule . Efficacy Assessments : The primary efficacy outcome measure Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale ( SOWS-Gossop ) score ( range = 0-30 ) Day 3 treatment phase define Days 1-5 , number day represent duration stay treatment program randomization . SOWS-Gossop administered Baseline Day 1 prior randomization 3.5 hour first dose Days 1 - 7 . Secondary outcome measure evaluate treatment effect opioid withdrawal symptom include , proportion subject require concomitant medication alleviate opiate withdrawal symptom proportion subject completers . In addition , composite longitudinal score SOWS-Gossop , Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale ( OOWS-Handelsman ) , Modified Global Clinical Impression Scale ( Subject Rater ) , Visual Analog Scale - Efficacy ( VAS-E ) also use assess treatment efficacy reduce withdrawal symptom . OOWS-Handelsman , MGCI ( Subject Rater ) , VAS-E administer Baseline Day 1 prior randomization 3.5 hour first dose Days 1-7 . Safety Assessments : After sign informed consent complete consent quiz , subject complete Screening assessment determine eligibility study enrollment . A complete physical examination perform first day screen . A repeat physical exam perform 3-4 hour randomization Day 1 , prior discharge Day 8 early termination . A 12-lead ECG conduct first day screen immediately prior admission . Four hour receive first dose study medication Days 1-7 , 12-lead ECG also conduct . A 12-lead ECG do prior discharge Day 8 early termination . If , opinion investigator , clinically significant change note ECG , measurement perform frequently . Additionally , next schedule dose study medication may withhold discretion investigator , subject may discontinue study . Subjects awaken weighed morning prior breakfast . Vital sign ( systolic diastolic blood pressure , heart rate , respiration rate , body temperature ) measure 3 hour dose study medication 0800 , 1300 , 1800 Days 1-7 , prior discharge Day 8 . For orthostatic blood pressure reading , subject remain sit 3 minute prior blood pressure reading , stand 1 minute prior second blood pressure reading . Clinical lab test do Screening , Day 7 early termination , need physician ? discretion . The urine sample collect first day Screening divide two aliquot . One sample go local lab confirmatory drug testing . The sample use immediate `` dip-stick '' analysis pregnancy ( female patient ) . A second `` dip-stick '' pregnancy test do Baseline , prior randomization . Adverse event concomitant medication use assess every day study ( Days 1-8 ) . Subjects demonstrate symptom withdrawal treat standard care use concomitant medication list Section 13.11 . At subject ? request , time , subject discontinue study without prejudice , medically stabilize ; subject refer , subject 's expense , treatment . Analysis : The primary outcome measure secondary outcome measure analyze use appropriate statistical method intent-to-treat , evaluable completer group . The Intent-to-Treat ( ITT ) group define subject randomize treatment . The evaluable group define subject ITT group receive least one dose study medication complete post-medication SOWS Day 1 . The completer group consist patient ITT group meet follow criterion : receive least one dose study drug Day 5 , complete SOWS-Gossop assessment Day 5 . It hypothesize lofexidine treatment , compare placebo , associate significant reduction opiate withdrawal symptom . All statistical test two-sided 5 % Type-I error rate . Confidence interval two-sided 95 % confidence coefficient . Summaries characteristic subject population treatment group baseline prepared modify intent-to-treat group completer group . A summary prepared show dropouts/retention time group subpopulation . All adverse event report quarterly indicating count unique adverse event body system preferred term ( MedDRA cod ) experience study subject group . Laboratory data , physical examination , vital sign report tabular form .</detailed_description>
