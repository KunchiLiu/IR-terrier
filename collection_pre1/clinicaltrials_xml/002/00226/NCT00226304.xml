	<brief_summary>This study evaluate usefulness two test quickly distinguish whether patient HIV infection focal brain lesion ( injury specific area brain ) rare type cancer call primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) , parasitic infection call toxoplasmic encephalitis . Toxoplasmic encephalitis cause parasite treated antibiotic . PCNSL ( lymphoma brain spinal cord ) must definitively diagnosed brain biopsy ( removal small piece brain tissue ) , treatment radiation therapy chemotherapy . The test study diagnose PCNSL toxoplasmic encephalitis measurement Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) DNA cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) FDG-PET scan brain . EBV often find CSF people PCNSL . The study also compare accuracy two image techniques-TI-SPECT FDG-PET-in distinguishing toxoplasmosis PCNSL . Patients 18 year age old HIV infection least one focal brain lesion without prior history PCNSL toxoplasmic encephalitis may eligible study . Each candidate screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test MRI scan brain . Upon enter study , participant take medication treat toxoplasmic encephalitis . They undergo lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) obtain CSF analysis , FDG-PET scan , 201TI-SPECT scan . For PET scan , radioactive substance inject arm , follow scan doughnut-shaped machine similar CT scanner . SPECT similar PET use different radioactive tracer , patient lie table SPECT camera rotate around patient 's head . Patients whose test result indicate low risk lymphoma continue antibiotic therapy toxoplasmosis . They repeat MRI scan around 4 , 7 , 14 day start drug monitor response therapy . Antiretroviral therapy initiated patient already regimen . Patients whose test result indicate high risk PCNSL CT scan look evidence lymphoma elsewhere body referred consultation neurosurgeon discus undergo brain biopsy . The brain biopsy do operating room general anesthesia . A small cut make scalp small opening make skull area brain biopsied . A needle place opening skull , guide CT MRI , move abnormal area brain , small piece tissue remove study microscope . Patients find toxoplasmosis discharge hospital care primary care physician get well tolerate medication . They return NIH follow-up visit 4 week , 6 month discharge . Patients find lymphoma referred National Cancer Institute screen enrollment treatment protocol . Patients eligible treatment protocol refer back primary care physician another NIH treatment protocol , one available . Patients lymphoma see NIAID outpatient clinic follow-up visit laboratory examination every 3 month 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Brain Lesions HIV-infected Patients Diagnosis Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) -associated primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) remain major problem among AIDS patient . The clinical presentation often clinically indistinguishable toxoplasmic encephalitis . The method choice establish definitive diagnosis brain biopsy . This procedure associate significant morbidity mortality , therefore less invasive mean diagnose cerebral mass lesion study . Currently , accept standard care HIV-infected patient present sign symptom focal brain lesion empirically treat toxoplasmic encephalitis . Brain biopsy often deferred demonstration lack clinical response progression empiric therapy . As result , treatment initiation frequently delay . During time unusual clinical deterioration occur appropriate therapy initiate . Frequently , alternative approach become question appropriate palliation rather curative intent therapy . Less invasive diagnostic test assist diagnosis investigate . Based find essentially 100 % HIV-related PCNSL EBV-associated , detection EBV DNA PCR amplification cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) demonstrate clinical usefulness diagnosis , use neuroradiologic imaging detect malignancy . Prior study demonstrate use combination neuroradiologic , immunologic , clinical variable workup focal brain lesion HIV-infected patient quite accurate identifying patient need brain biopsy , diagnostic algorithm incorporate combination sensitive specific test timely manner yet explore . This study seek evaluate algorithm workup HIV infect patient focal brain lesion expedite diagnosis subsequent treatment PCNSL . The goal study 1 ) determine specificity , sensitivity , positive predictive value diagnostic algorithm entail use combination EBV detection CSF FDG-PET scan diagnose PCNSL ; 2 ) evaluate time response anti-toxoplasmic encephalitis therapy , 3 ) evaluate sensitivity specificities FDG-PET ( 201 ) Tl-SPECT scan identify PCNSL . Up one hundred HIV-infected patient history least one focal brain lesion screen enrollment . All patient treat empirically toxoplasmic encephalitis alternative diagnosis confirm . All enrol patient treat concurrently antiretroviral therapy . Patients identify PCNSL refer NCI Treatment PCNSL Protocol treatment study open enrollment .</detailed_description>
