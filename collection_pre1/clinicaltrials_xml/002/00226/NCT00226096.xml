	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether lower high blood pressure level start stroke cause bleed brain ( intracerebral haemorrhage ) reduce chance person die survive long term disability . The study undertaken two phase : vanguard phase 400 patient , plan main phase 2000 patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intracerebral haemorrhage ( ICH ) one serious subtypes stroke , affect approximately 2-3 million people worldwide year . About one third people ICH die early onset majority survivor leave major long-term disability . Administration activate recombinant human Factor VII show limit haematoma expansion randomise controlled clinical trial ; however , future clinical use agent may limit short therapeutic time window , contraindication patient risk thromboembolism high cost . Currently , acute medical therapy show alter outcome ICH role surgery remain uncertain . Blood pressure ( BP ) level strongly positively associate incidence first recurrent stroke definite evidence BP lowering reduces stroke risk . Although BP level commonly elevate stroke onset , particularly ICH , effect BP lower treatment acute phase stroke remain unknown . The study aim establish effectiveness management policy early intensive BP lower death &amp; disability patient primary ICH compare current guideline-based management high BP clinical setting .</detailed_description>
