	<brief_title>Efalizumab Moderate Severe Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis common , highly pruritic , inflammatory skin disease affect 17 % school-aged child . Most case childhood atopic dermatitis improve resolve adulthood . However , majority patient retain feature atopic dermatitis continue severe disease continue adulthood . Moderate severe atopic dermatitis adeuately control topical agent . Consequently many patient treat systemic corticosteroid , cyclosporine , azathioprine , methotrexate , immunosuppressant carry risk severe atopic dermatitis greatly need . The chronic use current immunosuppressive agent limited cumulative end-organ toxicity . We propose inhibition T cell traffic skin Raptiva beneficial effect treatment patient moderate severe atopic dermatitis .</detailed_description>
