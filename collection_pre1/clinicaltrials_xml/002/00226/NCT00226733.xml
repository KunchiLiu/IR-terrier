	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect high moderate intensity exercise training coronary bypass surgery . The subject randomise train either 60-70 % 85-95 % maximal capacity daily four week . Primary outcome measure change maximal aerobic capacity , measure change maximal oxygen consumption , train period . Secondary outcome measure change quality life , heart rate variability , ultrasound measure heart blood variable , include endothelian marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Training Intensity After Coronary Bypass Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The exercise part cardiac rehabilitation today often compose low moderate intensity training . Several study find interval training high intensity effective improve physical capacity healthy subject also different patient population . We therefore wish compare high intensity interval training moderate intensity training patient operate coronary bypass surgery . Maximal oxygen consumption show best indicator many year life , healthy person cardiac patient . The subject study attend four week rehabilitation program residential institution Norway . They randomise either moderate high intensity aerobic training session day . The hypothesis advance , high intensity interval train lead great improvement maximal oxygen consumption train moderate intensity . We also hypothesise would difference two group 6 month , since patient administer exercise training .</detailed_description>
