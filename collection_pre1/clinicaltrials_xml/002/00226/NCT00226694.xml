	<detailed_description>Women men differ way stress affect development maintenance alcoholism . However , publish study alcohol dependent patient examine sex difference stress responsiveness likely mediate effect influence clinical course treatment disorder . The long-range goal research program define aspects neural , genetic environmental mechanism differentially regulate stress response alcohol dependent woman men . The propose study extend prior work reveal sex-dependent alteration basal serotonin-induced stress hormone concentration abstinent alcoholic . Our central hypothesis sex difference serotonin function HPA sensitivity conspire genetically influence alteration serotonin signal produce maladaptive stress response alcoholic woman . These alter stress response may serve target novel , sex-specific pharmacotherapies .</detailed_description>
