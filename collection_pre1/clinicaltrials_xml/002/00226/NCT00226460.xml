The patient willing participate lifelong xenotransplantation registry . The patient likely alternative diagnosis Parkinsonism base history , physical examination laboratory test . Atypical Parkinsonian variant ( ShyDrager , olivopontocerebellar atrophy , progressive supranuclear palsy striatonigral degeneration ) secondary Parkinsonism ( e.g. , secondary trauma metabolic abnormality ; history encephalitis , oculogyric crisis use dopaminergic antagonists/depleting drug ) exclude . The patient prior cranial neurosurgical procedure . The patient MRI CT evidence abnormality could lead Parkinsonism make patient unsuitable neurosurgical candidate . The patient history intracranial pathology ( e.g. , tumor , vascular malformation ) might make patient unsuitable neurosurgical candidate . The patient preexist medical condition may interfere evaluation safety and/or effectiveness study agent prevent study completion ( e.g . : , symptomatic cardiac disease , impaired renal function seizure disorder ) .
