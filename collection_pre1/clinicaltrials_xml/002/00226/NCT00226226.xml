	<brief_title>Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Placement IV Team Nurses Using Sonic Flashlight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We develop new device guide invasive procedure ultrasound ( US ) , call Sonic Flashlight ( SF ) . We attach half-silvered mirror small flat-panel monitor directly ultrasound transducer project virtual image US scan actual location within patient . This permit operator guide needle skin aim directly image , use natural hand-eye coordination rather look away patient conventional display . We believe SF increase accuracy , safety , speed wide variety invasive procedure yield faster learn procedure conventional US display . The research propose would bring application guide needle insertion clinical implementation , specifically address placement Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter ( PICC ) line . The PICC line increasingly view safe alternative direct central line placement jugular , subclavian , femoral vein , easy maintain peripheral intravenous line . This study test hypothesis PICC line place experienced intravenous ( IV ) team nurse use SF real-time US guidance . Thirty nurse participant ( age 18-65 ) recruit IV team UPMC Presbyterian Hospital participate study . 200 patient subject recruit adult ( 18 year old ) population patient already schedule receive PICC placement procedure ; patient line place experienced IV team nurse use ultrasound guidance either SF conventional ultrasound ( CUS ) . Investigators observe procedure , use audio video recording , ultrasound image data , characteristic procedure monitor success procedure . A set feasibility trial conduct interventional radiology ( IR ) suite assess level training nurse receive prior start comparison trial .</detailed_description>
