	<detailed_description>In Cambodia prevalence tuberculosis ( TB ) Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection high . In 2000 , approximately 75.000 newly diagnose TB case . In 2003 , 1.9 % population infect HIV . TB rate Cambodia double observe develop country 30 time higher currently see USA Western Europe . It estimate 8 % newly diagnose TB case co-infected HIV , approximately 85 % severely immunosuppressed ( CD4+ cell count &lt; 200 x 106 cells/l ) . Mortality rate find 2-4 fold higher HIV/TB co-infected patient TB alone . Data suggest aggressive management HIV infection , include Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy ( HAART ) treatment TB decrease morbidity mortality suppress viral replication improve immune function . On hand , use HAART patient TB may cause severe complication due drug-drug interaction , occasionally temporary exacerbation symptom , sign radiographic manifestation TB . Such event 'paradoxical reaction ' occur among 7 - 36 % HIV/TB co-infected patient treat HAART may secondary immune restitution . These reaction may particularly severe HAART start soon start TB treatment . Most clinical team recommend delay initiation HAART avoid early side effect TB treatment simplify clinical management co-infected patient . However others argue early initiation HAART TB patient CD4 cell count &lt; 100 x 106 cells/l lead mark reduction viral load despite frequent adverse event . The propose study aim determine optimal time initiate HAART ( define d4T + 3TC + efavirenz ) previously untreated HIV-infected adult patient TB low CD4 cell count . The study multicentre prospective , randomize , open-label two-armed trial placebo . It design superiority trial compare `` early arm '' ( HAART initiate 2 week TB treatment onset ) `` late arm '' ( HAART initiate 2 month TB treatment onset ) . Efficacy assess survival rate two arm . Secondary objective include evaluation ( 1 ) safety early initiation HAART term drug interaction paradoxical reaction , ( 2 ) occurrence opportunistic infection diagnose follow-up period , ( 3 ) patient ' adherence TB treatment HAART , ( 4 ) rate hospitalization cause trial ; measure ( 5 ) effectiveness TB treatment HAART ( 6 ) predictive factor survival , response anti-TB therapy HAART paradoxical reaction . The total study duration expect 4 year ( 3 year enrolment least one year follow-up ) five study site : ( 1 ) Khmero-Soviet Friendship Hospital , Phnom Penh ; ( 2 ) Calmette Hospital , Phnom Penh ; ( 3 ) Provincial hospital , Svay Rieng province ; ( 4 ) Provincial hospital , Takeo province , ( 5 ) Provincial Hospital , Siem Reap . The study carry compliance protocol accordance Declaration Helsinki approve World Health Association recommendation Good Clinical Practice .</detailed_description>
