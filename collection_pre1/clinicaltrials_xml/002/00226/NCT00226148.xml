	<detailed_description>This study randomize clinically control study three group thirty patient , bonehealing immediate implantplacement molarregions investigate . Totally 90 patient go get molar tooth extract immediately replace implant ( Br√•nemark System , Wide Platform ) . The molar tooth condition extract . Extracting molar leaf defect completely fill implant . The 90 patient therefore randomise 3 group accord perimarginal bonedefects around placed implant treat : 1 . Bonechips 2 . Membrane 3 . Bonechips+Membrane . The bonehealing defect around implant compare group . The amount newly form bone estimate digital radiography subtractionradiography . Furthermore prognosis immediate place implant molar region relation method defectreconstruction one year crown delivery also investigate . All investigation conduct Ho-hypothesis difference bonehealing three group .</detailed_description>
