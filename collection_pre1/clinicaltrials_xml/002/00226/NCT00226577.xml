	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy safety chemotherapy give prior lung cancer surgically remove . Patients resectable non-small cell lung cancer receive gemcitabine pemetrexed together 4 time biweekly . Patients see medical oncologist prior cycle chemotherapy give . The medical oncologist review patient 's bloodwork symptom prior approve next cycle chemotherapy . All patient evaluate scan determine response chemotherapy determine patient surgical candidate . These patient proceed surgery lung cancer remove . Follow visit include bloodwork , scan , visit medical oncologist every three month two year , every six month three year monitor disease recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate efficacy safety neoadjuvant chemotherapy gemcitabine pemetrexed give together 4-times biweekly patient resectable NSCLC . All patient see member Thoracic Oncology Program H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center Research Institute Tampa , Florida , discuss weekly multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference . The conference include pathologist , radiologist , thoracic surgeon , pulmonologists , radiation oncologist , medical oncologist , oncology nurse specialist , case manager , social worker , clinical trial coordinator . They initial test outline study timetable . Patients receive gemcitabine biweekly day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 dose 1,500 mg/m2 . They also receive pemetrexed dose 500 mg/m2 day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 . Gemcitabine give first period 30 minute i.v . follow pemetrexed 10 minute i.v . All patient get post induction chemotherapy PET scan , CT scan , PFT 's include DLCO . They go thoracotomy include bronchoscopy mediastinal lymph node dissection day 64 77 tumor deem completely resectable restaging study . The administration chemotherapy early time ( neoadjuvant induction chemotherapy ) follow diagnosis effort reduce risk disease recurrence . This approach also allow investigation molecular parameter may affect response chemotherapy patient ' survival . It hypothesis expression gene associate activation , inactivation , efficacy drug gemcitabine pemetrexed predict response therapy prognosis . We hypothesize expression gene alter chemotherapy , global assessment tumor proliferation , apoptosis , genome damage associate response therapy . We propose phase II study neoadjuvant chemotherapy gemcitabine pemetrexed patient resectable NSCLC , specifically correlate molecular genetic parameter primary clinical study endpoint disease response ( radiographic CR+PR ) secondary endpoint complete pathological response surgery , disease-free survival , overall survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Microscopically confirm nonsmall cell carcinoma lung , may confirm initial bronchoscopy mediastinoscopy , transthoracic needle biopsy . No prior therapy lung cancer . Patients must disease stage IB ( T2N0M0 ) , IIA ( T1N1M0 ) , IIB ( T2N1M0 T3N0M0 ) , IIIA ( T3N1M0 T13N2M0 ) . Patients 2 lesion one lobe ( T4 ) ( Stage IIIB ) eligible . Patients must deem medically fit surgical resection thoracic surgeon . Patients must ECOG performance status Zero One . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . Measurable Disease : Any mass reproducibly measurable one diameter ( RECIST criterion ) . Evaluable disease : Lesions apparent chest CT , meet criterion measurability . These include illdefined mass associate post obstructive change . Age &gt; 18 year . Patient must able understand sign inform consent . Patients must &gt; 12 week prior major surgery , coronary artery bypass graft .

Nonmalignant effusion cytology negative , nonbloody , transudate . Effusions visible CT large enough safe thoracentesis result ineligibility . Exudative effusion , even cytologically negative exclude . Pleural fluid consider exudative : ratio pleural fluid protein serum protein &gt; 0.5 ratio pleural fluid LDH serum serum LDH &gt; 0.6 Pleural fluid LDH &gt; 200 IU/liter . A stag PET scan use exclude patient . If multiple area FDG uptake outside area primary tumor hilar ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node , patient exclude virtue metastatic disease . If however , one area show increase FDG uptake , area concern need evaluation biopsy exclude metastatic disease . N3 lymph node ( contralateral mediastinal/hilar supraclavicular/scalene ) T4 primary tumor ( malignant pleural effusion mediastinal invasion ) clinical stag criterion ( N3 see CT PET scan , may prove mediastinoscopy investigator discretion ) . Pregnancy . Other active malignancy within 2 year exception nonmelanoma skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ . Psychologic , familial , sociologic , geographic condition , permit biweekly medical followup adherence study protocol . Prior radiation therapy cancer thorax .</criteria>
