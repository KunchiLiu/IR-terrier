	<brief_title>Treatment With Peginterferon Alfa-2a ( 40 KD ) Chronic Hepatitis B Patients , Who Have Failed Anti-viral Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B commonest cause liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma Hong Kong . Persistent high viraemia necro-inflammation associate high risk liver-related complication . Lamivudine adefovir dipivoxil two anti-viral agent suppress replication virus . However , drug use either alone combination induce HBeAg seroconversion le 20 % patient . Most patient therefore required long-term treatment , risk development drug resistance . Premature cessation anti-viral agent usually accompany relapse viraemia hepatitis . Pegylated interferon-alfa-2a modified form interferon 40 kDa polyethylene glycol strand attach recombinant interferon . This formulation increase product 's half-life 7-10 hour 77 hour . Therefore administered convenient weekly basis . Pegylated interferon-alfa-2a monotherapy 24 week show induce sustain HBeAg seroconversion 35 % patient optimal dose 180 mcg weekly . This drug find effective conventional interferon-alfa treatment chronic hepatitis B well chronic hepatitis C. Data interferon-based treatment among chronic hepatitis B patient fail previous anti-viral treatment scanty . It uncertain whether pegylated interferon-alfa-2a treatment effective group patient . This single-center , pilot study virological response chronic HBV infection pegylated interferon-alfa-2a among patient fail anti-viral treatment past . This study investigate HBV DNA suppression ( HBeAg seroconversion among HBeAg positive patient ) pegylated interferon treatment 24 week end treatment .</detailed_description>

Additionally , female must use reliable contraception study 3 month treatment completion . Evidence decompensated liver disease ( Childs BC ) , hepatocellular carcinoma , preexist severe depression psychiatric disease , significant cardiac disease , significant renal disease , seizure disorder severe retinopathy . Patients receive antiviral therapy chronic hepatitis B systemic antiviral , antineoplastic immunomodulatory treatment ( include supraphysiologic dos steroid radiation ) within past 6 month . Positive test screening antiHIV , antiHCV . Patients expect need systemic antiviral therapy provide study time participation study also exclude . Exception : patient limited ( &lt; =7 day ) course acyclovir herpetic lesion 1 month prior first administration test drug exclude . Serum total bilirubin &gt; 3X upper limit normal screening . History evidence bleed esophageal varix condition consistent decompensated liver disease . History evidence medical condition associate chronic liver disease HBV ( e.g. , hemochromatosis , autoimmune hepatitis , metabolic liver disease include Wilson 's alpha1antitrypsin deficiency , alcoholic liver disease , toxin exposure , thalassemia ) .

History immunologically mediate disease History evidence chronic pulmonary disease associate functional limitation . Severe cardiac disease History severe seizure disorder current anticonvulsant use . Evidence active suspect cancer history malignancy risk recurrence &gt; 20 % within 2 year . Patients lesion suspicious hepatic malignancy screen image study eligible likelihood carcinoma 10 % follow appropriate evaluation . History receive systemic antineoplastic ( include radiation ) immunomodulatory treatment Major organ transplantation . Thyroid disease thyroid function poorly control prescribed medication . Patients abnormal thyroid stimulate hormone T4 concentration , elevation antibody thyroid peroxidase clinical manifestation thyroid disease exclude . History evidence severe retinopathy clinically relevant ophthalmological disorder due diabetes mellitus hypertension Inability unwillingness provide inform consent abide requirement study . History evidence severe illness condition would make patient , opinion investigator , unsuitable study . Patients value alphafetoprotein &gt; 100 ng/mL exclude , unless stability ( le 10 % increase ) document least previous 3 month . Evidence drug and/or alcohol abuse ( 20g/day woman 30g/day men ) . Patients include another trial give investigational drug within 12 week prior screen Any known history hypersensitivity interferon .</criteria>
