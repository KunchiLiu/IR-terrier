	<detailed_description>Modulation cholinergic activity grow focus neurologic therapeutic especially dementing disorder Alzheimer disease . Treatment recently develop cholinesterase inhibitor , galantamine , demonstrate significant improvement issue relate tolerability . In addition inhibiting activity acetylcholinesterase , galantamine also modulate activity nicotinic cholinergic receptor allosteric mechanism . As result , galantamine therapy may beneficial response agent limited . Cholinesterase inhibitor therapy report improve motor tic child TS refractory traditional therapy . Symptoms co-morbid behavioral disorder , primarily inattention , also improve . Cholinergic modulation appear promising avenue manage tic disorder . Men woman ( 18 - 50 year age ) fulfil DSM IV criterion diagnosis chronic motor tic disorder , chronic vocal tic disorder Tourette Syndrome experience suboptimal control tic current therapy enrol open label evaluation galantamine . A total 6 visit require 22 week . Participants follow standard 4 week titration schedule achieve 12 mg bid 8 week . They maintain 12 mg bid , maximum tolerate dose , 8 week withdrawn therapy . The difference tic severity prior upon completion therapy examine . The impact treatment upon obsessions/compulsions , attention/concentration , depression , anxiety quality life also determine .</detailed_description>
