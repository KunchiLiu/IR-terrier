	<brief_title>Evaluation Endovascular Repair Aortic Aneurysm ( EVAR ) Program LHSC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms traditionally repair use standard open surgical technique . The use Endovascular stent graft ( EVAR ) treat aortic aneurysm ongoing approximately 8-10 year . Use EVAR treat aortic aneurysms high risk report beneficial . However , cost therapy quite significant therefore order best understand cost effectiveness type aneurysm treatment , extensive prospective comparative evaluation require . This study compare outcomes cost-effectiveness patient receive EVAR , high surgical risk , OSR , low surgical risk , OSR , high surgical risk suitable EVAR base anatomical complexity . Demographic , medical , health care resource utilization , cost , quality life information collect participate patient period year follow repair .</detailed_description>
