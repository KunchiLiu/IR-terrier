	<brief_summary>CYP2C9 , one major drug metabolism enzymes account 20 % hepatic cytochrome P450 content second CYP3A4 . The propose study explore different possible drug interaction CYP2C9 substrates evaluate effect prototype inducer inhibitor phenotypic trait measurement . It expect identification drug might interact CYP2C9 substrate use rationalize future drug interaction study design evaluate actual magnitude effect clinical implication . This approach particularly useful apply CYP2C9 drug characterize narrow therapeutic index ( i.e . warfarin ) . This study consist three study period separate two week washout period . In course study subject receive double blind , crossover fashion , rifampin 300 mg. twice daily , diclofenac 50 mg twice daily . fluconazole 200 mg. twice daily , one week . All drug administer identical look tablet prepared pharmacy Hadassah University Hospital order administration randomized.On day prior , day 6 7 day follow drug period , activity CYP2C9 evaluate administration single phenytoin 300 mg. dose . The subject request collect urine 24 hour single blood sample obtain 12 hour post phenytoin intake .</brief_summary>
