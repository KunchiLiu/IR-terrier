	<brief_title>Manual Wheelchair Propulsion Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research create manual wheelchair propulsion-training program ( MWPTP ) emphasize propulsion technique improve manual wheelchair user stroke pattern efficiency . It hope design manual wheelchair-training program help minimize upper extremity pain injury often associate manual wheelchair propulsion . The MWPTP exist three form , give three randomly assign group subject . An instruction group ( IO ) receive general instruction best propel wheelchair . A feedback group ( FB ) receive additional instruction wheelchair propulsion use monitor display random combination amount biomechanical feedback variable , cadence proportion time spend propulsion . Subjects coach develop appropriate propulsion style minimizes predetermine feedback measure , indicate poor technique maximize graphical measure indicate good propulsion technique . A control group ( CG ) receive test identical testing procedure follow IO FB group . Participation study consist four visit Human Engineering Research Lab ( HERL ) FB , IO CG . Visits 1-4 , except visit 4 include train group . All subject use wheelchair cushion ; however researcher attach SMART Wheels TM subject ' wheelchair place current wheel . The SMART Wheels TM use record force moment occur propulsion alter dimension feel subject current wheelchair . During visit , subject ask push real life course include various grade surface . Then ask push wheelchair dynamometer 1 meter/sec one minute , 2 meter/sec one minute , self select speed one minute . During time , data may also collect use Optotrak kinematic measurement system incorporate camera 3D-motion analysis system .</detailed_description>
