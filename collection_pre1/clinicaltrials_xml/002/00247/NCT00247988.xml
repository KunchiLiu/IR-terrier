	<brief_title>Weekly Carboplatin Taxotere Platinum Sensitive Relapsed Ovarian Tubal Primary Peritoneal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer sixth common malignancy woman , estimate 2500 case diagnosed 2001 , 1500 death . Despite maximal cytoreductive therapy , follow normally taxane carboplatin ( cisplatin ) chemotherapy , patient relapse , require chemotherapy palliative setting . The goal second line therapy prolong survival improve quality life . This disease characterize chronic , many patient may eventually go respond additional line therapy . Response second line therapy correlate length time since end first line treatment ( treatment free interval , TFI ) . Patients relapse progress therapy define platinum-refractory . In North America norm label patient TFI 6 month less platinum-resistant . A TFI great 6 month would make patient platinum-sensitive . These platinum-sensitive patient generally treat single agent carboplatin carboplatin taxol 3-weekly administration . The ICON-4 trial publish June 2003 compare single agent platinum combination platinum-taxol . Patients could receive one agent adjuvant setting . At median follow-up 42 month absolute difference 2-year survival 7 % [ P=0.0004 } favor combination arm . Thus combination platinum-taxol present standard care platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer . Use taxol limit persistent neuropathy 20 % . Presently grow evidence support give chemotherapy shorter interval low-doses . Hypothetically , allow less advancement cancer cell cell cycle . Moreover weekly taxanes associate anti-angiogenic effect- taxotere taxol cell-lines . Several randomized trial breast cancer show improved efficacy weekly taxol 3-weekly taxol . The neoadjuvant study show increase pCR [ complete response pathologic evaluation ] 10 % weekly taxol . The adjuvant study 2-weekly chemotherapy show 7 % improvement time-to-progression 3-weekly chemotherapy . In ovarian cancer- Phase II study weekly carboplatin ( AUC-2 ) taxol ( 80mg/m2/week ) give day 1,8,15 28 day cycle show response rate 100 % [ 80 % CR , 20 % PR ] 21 platinum-sensitive patients- either measurable evaluable disease . Median duration response 11.7 month ( 95 % CI- 8.0-18.5 month ) . 46 % report Grade I neuropathy , 1 patient febrile neutropenia , 32 % Grade 3 neutropenia . Weekly administration taxotere carboplatin studied Phase I study . Maximum tolerate dose Taxotere 35mg/m2 carboplatin AUC-2 . At dose Grade 3 4 cytopenia see . Nor significant neuropathy . Our study plan evaluate Taxotere 35mg/m2 Carboplatin AUC-2 give weekly . 3 weekly treatment constitute one cycle . We expect see equivalent response rate equivalent high duration response well toxicity profile .</detailed_description>
