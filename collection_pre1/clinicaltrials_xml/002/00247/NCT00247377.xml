	<brief_summary>PURPOSE Obesity grow problem United States . Severe obesity , know `` morbid obesity '' , define 100 pound excess ideal body weight . Nonsurgical treatment morbid obesity include exercise , dietary restriction , behavior modification , pharmacological intervention . However , estimate patient undergo nonsurgical treatment weight reduction regain weight within 2 4 year treatment . According NIH consensus conference 1991 , surgery remain effective sustained weight loss treatment morbid obesity . The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( GBP ) currently consider gold standard bariatric surgical operation . Mean weight loss follow GBP approximately 65 % excess body weight first 12 18 month postoperatively . Long-term weight loss range 55-70 % excess body weight loss . Recently , laparoscopic approach GBP report . Wittgrove colleague report result 75 patient underwent laparoscopic GBP demonstrate significant short-term advantage comparable weight loss reversal comorbidities compare open approach . However , GBP might do laparoscopic open approach potentially associate significant morbidity mortality anastomotic leak , pulmonary embolism , bowel obstruction , postoperative stricture . The FDA recently approve laparoscopic adjustable banding system ( LAP-BAND ) use United States June 2001 . The LAP-BAND system device design induce weight loss severely obese patient . It surgically place around proximal stomach create small proximal stomach pouch restrict opening , stoma , passage food slow . An inflatable portion along inner aspect band connect access port , place intramuscularly . This enabled stoma adjustment make without need surgery . The advantage LAP-BAND system include cut open stomach wall , ability adjust stoma technically easy operation perform laparoscopic GBP . We want evaluate LAP-BAND procedure effective laparoscopic GBP procedure treatment morbid obesity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : 1 . Morbid obesity health consequence increase United States 2 . Roux-en-Y GBP effective treatment morbid obesity associate substantial morbidity 3 . LAP-BAND system effective treatment morbidly obese patient potentially reduce morbidity compare laparoscopic GBP HYPOTHESIS : 1 . LAP-BAND perform safely associate reduced postoperative pain , decrease morbidity , decrease ICU hospital stay , reduce cost , comparable improvement quality-of-life , acceptable long-term weight loss compare laparoscopic GBP 2 . LAP-BAND associated decrease fluid requirement perioperative period , improve postoperative pulmonary function , low intraabdominal pressure compare laparoscopic GBP 3 . LAP-BAND alter esophageal motility effective improvement gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) symptom . OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS : 1 . To determine short-term outcome , quality-of-life , cost , long-term weight loss laparoscopic GBP compare LAP-BAND . 2 . To compare physiologic change perioperative fluid requirement , postoperative pulmonary function , intraabdominal pressure laparoscopic GBP LAP-BAND . 3 . To evaluate effect LAP-BAND esophageal motility effectiveness control gastroesophageal reflux symptom ( GERD ) morbidly obese patient GERD . Please note : All physician , hospital , laboratory cost , barium study test , performance operation bill subject insurer customary since procedure standard care regardless participation study . The research procedures pulmonary function test , intra-abdominal pressure , body fat composition test , rest energy expenditure , exercise testing , strength testing , nutritional assessment , esophageal function test consider research-related pay investigator .</detailed_description>
