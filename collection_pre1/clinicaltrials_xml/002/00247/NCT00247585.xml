	<brief_summary>The objective investigate residual effect heavy drinking , without hangover symptom . The primary aim test several hypothesis residual effect heavy drinking . Hypotheses heavy drinking affect next-day performance include direct physiological effect alcohol , alcohol withdrawal effect , non-ethanol effect , congener , family history alcohol problem . The investigator test follow hypothesis : 1. relative placebo , heavy drinking degrade next-day performance , relationship mediate full part quality sleep ; 2. high congener alcoholic beverage affect performance great degree low congener beverage relationship mediate severity hangover symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim propose study test several hypothesis residual effect heavy drinking . Hypotheses heavy drinking affect next-day performance include direct physiological effect alcohol ( e.g. , electrolyte imbalance , low blood sugar , sleep disturbance ) , alcohol withdrawal effect , acetaldehyde toxicity , non-ethanol effect , congener family history alcohol ( Swift Davidson , 1998 ) . Using placebo-controlled randomized trial , dose participant placebo high low congener alcoholic beverage ( level 0.10 g % BAC ) night perform exercise neurobehavioral evaluation system . We monitor participant ’ sleep ass sleep disturbance . We collect information hangover symptom morning dosing . We also collect data participant ’ family history drinking problem . We test follow hypothesis : 1. relative placebo , heavy drinking degrade next-day cognitive performance , relationship mediate full part quality sleep ; 2. high congener alcoholic beverage affect performance great degree low congener beverage relationship mediate severity hangover symptom . We explore whether residual effect heavy drink next-day cognitive performance attenuate among participant positive family history alcohol problem , relative family-history-negative participant . A secondary aim test effectiveness Psychomotor Vigilance Test ( PVT ) , validated measure fatigue , fitness-for-duty test . We test whether PVT distinguish dosing status ( alcohol placebo ) participant time performance measure next day extent PVT measure correlate performance score . Participants young adult age 21-30 currently enrol undergraduate college university graduate college university . Alcoholic beverages bourbon ( high-congener ) soda vodka ( low-congener ) soda . Placebo tonic alone . We use mixed within- between-subjects design , balance order placebo alcohol administration . Performance measure use computer-based neurobehavioral evaluation system .</detailed_description>
