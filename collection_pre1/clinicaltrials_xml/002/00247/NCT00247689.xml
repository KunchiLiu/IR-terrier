	<brief_summary>Background : - Research show several human gene associate vulnerability substance abuse dependence . However , little known people genetic tendency react drug control setting . - Methylphenidate , also know Ritalin , commonly prescribed number condition , include attention deficit disorder . Because methylphenidate widely use study brain chemistry behavior relatively low risk associate use , researcher interest see affect think process people apparent genetic vulnerability drug abuse . Objectives : - To evaluate whether individual apparent genetic vulnerability drug abuse react differently methylphenidate people vulnerability . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age older participate NIDA protocol Allelic Linkage Substance Abuse . Design : - Participants ask avoid use number over-the-counter medication , include antihistamine , cough medicine , nasal decongestant , 24 hour study day . Participants also ask avoid consuming caffeinated beverage , nicotine tobacco product , alcohol morning day study , provide urine sample start study test chemical may interfere study . - Because nature study drug , participant allow drive clinical center day study . ( Return transportation arrange . ) - At start study , participant take two tablet ( 1 hour apart ) , tell whether tablet study drug placebo . - Participants give regular answer question mood think process computer approximately 5 hour . Blood sample take part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Scientific Goals . We others identify several human chromosomal region contain genetic marker associate vulnerability substance abuse/dependence several different human population ( Uhl et al , 2002 ) . However , little known biological behavioral mechanism specific molecular genetic characteristic enhance risk drug disorder . This protocol test hypotheses genetically-mediated individual difference acute response abuse substance contribute mechanism specific human allelic variant influence individual difference vulnerability drug abuse/dependence . This protocol characterize individual difference responses oral methylphenidate ( 30 mg ) ( also know Ritalin ) . We choose agent due ) wide clinical use , b ) moderate low risk largely well-understood result widespread use , c ) prior usefulness u others probe reward system activity , example , patient dopaminergic brain lesion ( Persico et al 1998 ) . We choose dose due : ) prior success dose , even brain lesioned clinical population ( Persico et al 1998 ) b ) preliminary work candidate gene study individual administer oral dos 60-70 mg ( GRU et al , preparation ) c ) consultations worker field advise use dose used dos 0.5 mg/kg intravenously prior work report adverse event ( Volkow et al , 2003 ) . We study individual select base genotype . We test hypothesis individual display combination abuse-associated and/or resistance-associated allelic variant different genomic locus others reproducibly associate substance abuse ( Uhl et al 2002 ) differ acute response methylphenidate administration . We also perform exploratory analysis data . We study genotypes individual display high- low-level response oral methylphenidate administration . Both hypothesis-testing exploratory aspect study allow u identify addiction-associated human gene variant alter subjective physiologic response administration methylphenidate . Method . We study previous participant study # 148 ( 90-DA-N448 ) already consent recontact NIDA personnel . We select individual eligible study participation base genotype marker whose allele differ drug abuser ( report significant lifetime use dependence least one illegal substance ) control ( individual free significant lifetime use addictive substance ) well allelic variant gene express reward circuit . Patients receive psychiatric medical screening . Eligible volunteer participant one-day study session receive oral placebo oral methylphenidate ( 30 mg ) single-blinded fashion . This design choose allow study participation large fraction eligible participant likely consent inpatient stay long design . Subjective methylphenidate effect , plasma level methylphenidate heart rate assess periodically 4 hour drug administer . Methylphenidate choose probe : ( 1 ) mechanism action directly involve central monoaminergic reward pathway , include dopamine norepinephrine transporter inhibition , ( 2 ) broad clinical experience drug significant side effect well know low frequency broad population ( 3 ) individual difference methylphenidate subjective response document several sort study , include study Parkinsonian patient control previously report group . Hypothesis . We advance two-tailed hypothesis subjective liking VAS responses methylphenidate different individual multiple candidate genetic characteristic relate enhanced vulnerability substance abuse/dependence compare match control genomic characteristic . Confidence great association consistent among Caucasian/European American African American participant , internal replication build design . Benefits . The result important implication possible mechanisms genetic vulnerability substance abuse ( particularly psychostimulants ) express human . The finding also bear genetic predictor response methylphenidate , may important attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , narcolepsy clinical disorder drug class use therapeutically . Risks . Methylphenidate also know Ritalin , commonly prescribe number clinical condition include attention deficit/hyperactivity syndrome . The drug use many individual serious complication . Individuals use drug long period time may show nervousness sleep change . Skin rash , appetite suppression , nausea , dizziness , heart palpitation , pulse heart rhythm change , headache , abnormal movement , sleepiness , chest pain , abdominal pain , liver function change , blood cell change change think also rarely reported individual use drug chronically . A review patient take treatment dose methylphenidate ADHD reveal serious cardiovascular adverse event patient underlie serious heart problem defect , report stroke heart attack adult certain risk factor , ( i.e . untreated high blood pressure history coronary artery disease ) . Another review patient take treatment dose methylphenidate ADHD reveal slight increase risk ( 1 per 1,000 ) drug-related psychiatric adverse event , hear voice , become suspicious reason , become manic , even patient previous psychiatric problem . Additional modest minimal risk participant include risk venous catheterization blood withdrawal , include pain , bruise bleeding , risk confidentiality . We minimize minimal risk appropriate exclusionary criterion , medical screening , use low/moderate drug dos , evaluation prior discharge , availability taxi return home , aseptic method , small total amount blood drawn , standard minimal risk recording procedure , cod , lock data Confidentiality Certification work .</detailed_description>
