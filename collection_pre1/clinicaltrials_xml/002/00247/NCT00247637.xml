	<brief_title>The Genetic Basis Inherited Neurologic Deficits People With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia disable disorder associate specific inheritable neurobiologic deficit . These deficit cause problem memory , visual attention , information processing , aspect daily live . Understanding genetic component deficit people schizophrenia unaffected family member may help uncover neurobiological basis , risk factor , heritability disease . In addition , information may serve create effective treatment possibly cure disease . This study serve provide information genetic basis know inherited neurobiological deficit people schizophrenia . In turn , may guide study genetics schizophrenia . Participants attend 2 study visit , last approximately 4 hour . The first include blood test diagnostic interview participate family evaluate presence schizophrenic symptom . The second study visit entail four neurocognitive neurophysiological test . Participants first pre-pulse inhibition test , use electrode measure eye blinking . Electrodes also place participant ' head , ear , around eye measure brain wave . Next , participant undergo oculomotor test , wear glass fit sensor record eye movement . Participants ask repeat list word , letter , number read researcher . Last , participant undergo computerized performance test require watch computer screen click mouse whenever see number 0 9 . Each study visit take approximately 4 hour .</detailed_description>
