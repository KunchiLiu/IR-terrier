	<detailed_description>Patient selection Consecutive patient operate Department Cardiothoracic Surgery , Aarhus University Hospital Skejby include . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Clinical indication corrective operation congenital heart disease use right lateral atriotomy , 2 . Age &gt; 18 year , 3 . Ability give inform consent . The exclusion criterion acute operation . Written inform consent obtain patient prior inclusion study . The ethical committee Aarhus County approve study September 18 , 2003 . Operation postoperative care The operation perform usual fashion . Additionally , single linear endocardial 1-minute cryolesion connect right lateral atriotomy tricuspid annulus anteriorly crista terminalis posteriorly perform right atriotomy suture ( Figure 1 ) . SurgiFrost® cryosurgical probe ( Endocare Inc. , Irvine , California ) use . Two pairs epicardial electrode place atrium incision tricuspid annulus 1.5 cm cranially , caudally cryolesion end repair . They bring together thorax patient ’ right side . Subsequently , thorax close usual way . Patients monitor continuously use bedside monitor telemetry first 16-24 hour operation . A 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) obtain clinical suspicion arrhythmia . Atrial tachycardia define sustained regular monomorphic atrial rhythm constant rate &gt; 100/min originate outside sinus node . Measurement conduction time On second postoperative day , conduction time measure help pace electrode pair one side cryolesion incision tricuspid annulus sense unipolar signal side ( Figure 2 ) . Signals record 100 mm/s use commercially available ECG machine . Electrophysiology study coronary angiography Electrophysiology study coronary angiography carry 3 month operation . Patients free antiarrhythmic agent time study . Coronary angiography perform usual technique femoral approach . Afterwards , 7-French quadripolar deflectable ablation catheter 4-mm tip electrode ( Navistar® , Biosense Webster , Diamond Bar , California ) advance via right femoral vein right atrium mapping radiofrequency catheter ablation . An active fixation lead ( Sweet Picotip® , Guidant , St. Paul , Minnesota ) screw lateral right atrium near tricuspid annulus perform cryolesion use pacing . Simultaneous recording intracardiac electrograms filter 50-500 Hz 12-lead surface ECG store digitally ( CardioLab® , Prucka Engineering , Inc. , Houston , Texas Prucka CardioLab 2000® , GE Medical Systems , Milwaukee , Wisconsin ) . An electroanatomic map ( CARTO® , Biosense Webster , Diamond Bar , California ) construct pace special emphasis region surgical scar cryolesion able judge conduction across cryolesion . Afterwards , active fixation lead reposition opposite side cryolesion near Navistar® catheter , place help already construct electroanatomic map . Another electroanatomic map create pace second site judge completeness cryolesion direction . Afterwards , attempt induction atrial arrhythmia make . These include rapid atrial pace 20 stimuli start cycle length 400 m 20 m decrement cycle length 200 m , single double extrastimuli 400 m cycle length atrial refractoriness . Isoproterenol use study . Safety assessment intervention All adverse event record . Likely relationship adverse event study intervention determine base consensus participate investigator . Statistical analysis All calculation carry use statistical software Intercooled Stata® Release 8 ( Stata Corporation , College Station , Texas ) . Comparison continuous variable perform use Student ’ t-test , Wilcoxon rank-sum test , appropriate . Comparison proportion perform use Fisher ’ exact test . Median ( interquartile range ) mean ± standard deviation report , appropriate .</detailed_description>
