	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine objective ( urodynamic ) cure rate effect patient quality life six month treatment two different nonsurgical management option genuine stress urinary incontinence female : weight vaginal cone formal supervise pelvic floor physiotherapy biofeedback . Hypothesis : Assuming minimum six month treatment , weight vaginal cone effective formal supervise program pelvic floor physiotherapy biofeedback treatment uncomplicated genuine stress urinary incontinence female .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weighted Vaginal Cones Versus Biofeedback Treatment Urodynamic Stress Incontinence : Randomized Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Urinary incontinence widespread debilitate medical problem , estimate prevalence 17-45 % adult woman . Genuine stress incontinence common form urinary incontinence woman , objective diagnosis make via urodynamics . Urinary continence maintain urethral resistance ( pressure ) great intravesical pressure . Genuine stress incontinence occur pressure transmission urethra compromise poor anatomic support proximal urethra result weaken pelvic floor musculature and/or defective endopelvic fascia . While gold standard treatment genuine stress incontinence still consider surgical , renew interest among patient surgeon nonsurgical ( conservative ) management . The goal conservative therapy restrengthen retrain pelvic floor muscle improve urethral pressure transmission thus improve continence mechanism . Nonsurgical therapy include PFME without biofeedback , weight vaginal cone . PFME biofeedback widely accept effective conservative treatment genuine stress incontinence , subjective cure rate estimate high 70 percent . However , date , objective cure rate define urodynamics well document . Similarly , limited study suggest vaginal cone therapy result subjective cure rate 60 % , objective cure rate still determine . With grow clinic surgical waiting list rise hospital cost , weight vaginal cone , objectively prove comparably effective alternative physiotherapy , offer effective management option stress incontinence , thus , perhaps avoid referral tertiary hospital physiotherapy , surgery . We hypothesize follow minimum six month treatment , weight vaginal cone would effective formal supervise program pelvic floor physiotherapy biofeedback treatment uncomplicated genuine stress urinary incontinence female . We thus seek evaluate feasibility randomize clinical trial . Method An estimate 60 woman identify ambulatory clinic multichannel urodynamics document genuine stress urinary incontinence need participate single-blind , randomize pilot study . Once enter , patient randomize receive one two different nonsurgical treatment : PFME biofeedback weight vaginal cone . The patient chart compliance treatment duration study . A quality life questionnaire complete begin end trial , along subjective assessment incontinence severity via standardized questionnaire . The study period six month . Upon completion study , patient undergo repeat multichannel urodynamics perineal pad test determine genuine stress incontinence present absent thus whether objective cure achieve . Results analyze compare statistically .</detailed_description>

Additional inclusion criterion history urinary stress incontinence multichannel cystometry confirm presence genuine stress incontinence ( GSI ) . urodynamic identification detrusor instability active ( untreated resistant ) urinary tract infection disease felt investigator potentially interfere participation ( e.g . arthritis limit dexterity thus interfere insertion removal vaginal cone ) previous treatment pelvic floor physiotherapy biofeedback functional electric stimulation urinary incontinence previous use weight vaginal cone previous antiincontinence surgery significant pelvic organ prolapse abnormal vaginal anatomy ( Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification ( POPQ ) system score prolapse use , Grade &gt; III ) use concomitant treatment trial start new medication may alter continence mechanism inability understand instruction French English provide inform consent ( e.g. , psychiatric disease ) . pregnancy ( may alter pelvic anatomy may course study thus make evaluation treatment method impossible )</criteria>
