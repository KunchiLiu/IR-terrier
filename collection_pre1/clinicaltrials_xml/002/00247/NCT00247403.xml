	<brief_summary>Ionizing radiation produce cancer cell death create high level reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , superoxide hydrogen peroxide , irradiated cell . Cancer cell preferentially affect ROS . The investigator , therefore , propose interfere detoxification ROS make radiation toxic cancer cell . Several cellular mechanism exist detoxify ROS , glucose metabolism play important role many mechanism . The investigator propose interfere glucose metabolism sensitize cancer cell radiation . The investigator ' central hypothesis 2DG sensitize cancer cell ionize radiation inhibiting use glucose detoxify reactive oxygen specie produce radiation . As initial step evaluate hypothesis , investigator design phase I study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study 2DG With Stereotactic Radiosurgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiosurgery proven treatment option intracranial metastasis . This trial initial effort potentiate therapeutic effect single dose stereotactic radiosurgery combine radiation sensitize agent , 2DG , radiosurgery treatment intracranial metastasis . Our preclinical study indicate degree cancer cell radiosensitization use 2DG increase increase radiation dose . We therefore interested use 2DG radiosurgery , since technique allow delivery large single dose radiation . This trial seek determine maximum tolerable one time dose 2DG delivered subject receive stereotactic radiosurgery . We also measure physiologic effect 2DG glucose reactive oxygen specie metabolism .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Brain metastases histologically confirm extracranial cancer previously confirm intracranial carcinoma . Carcinoma must stag use American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) stag criterion version 6 . Morphologically welldefined tumor mass compute tomography ( CT ) /magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ( large diameter le 40 mm ) resection . Intracranial mass mass â‰¤ 4 cm great diameter . Patients multiple mass eligible radiosurgery treatment time expect last less one hour ( typically maximum 6 lesion ) . Standard institutional radiotherapeutic treatment stereotactic radiosurgery deliver use biteplate localization . Greater equal 21 year age . Pediatric subject represent minority patient otherwise meet eligibility criterion . Inclusion child different study would consider therapy find effective adult part trial safety 2DG child investigate . Karnofsky great equal 70 % time screen Life expectancy great 3 month Subjects must normal organ marrow function define : serum glucose &lt; 200 mg/dl hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1c ) &lt; 8.5 % Contraceptive use men woman childbearing potential prior , duration , study . The teratogenic effect ionize radiation well document , 2DG potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Nursing infant must suspend study . There unknown potential risk adverse event infant nurse patient treat 2DG , therefore breastfeed must discontinue duration study . Ability ingest 50 ml fluid either mouth feeding tube . Inclusion woman minority : Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial . Subjects diabetes mellitus , elevate HbA1c elevate blood glucose . Subjects require headring ( 'halo ' ) immobilization standard stereotactic localization . Patients metastases adjacent optic chiasm , optic nerve radiosensitive tissue necessitate accuracy headring exclude . Subjects must receive investigational agent . Subjects history myocardial infarction past year and/or dependent betaadrenergic block agent . Subjects uncontrolled seizure disorder . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment nursing mother 2DG , breastfeed must discontinue nurse mother treat . Pregnant woman exclude study . The teratogenic effect ionize radiation well document , 2DG potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test result immediately prior study become pregnant suspect pregnant study , must inform treat physician immediately . Inclusion prisoner vulnerable population : Prisoners vulnerable population , child , enrol .</criteria>
