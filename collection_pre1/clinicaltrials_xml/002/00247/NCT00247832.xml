	<detailed_description>There currently little information indicator factor patient 's readiness discharge . Vancouver General Hospital attempt create standardize clinical pathway individual undergone lobectomy , increase patient satisfaction decrease hospital stay complication rate . This study aim examine relationship patient 's readiness discharge lobectomy mobilization rate ( measure number step take day ) , frequency visitation family friend , level anxiety level pain experienced patient . To , test hypothesis ) patient great mobilization visitation rate decrease anxiety pain level great self-perceived readiness discharge b ) patient receive daily mobilization goal personal motivation high step rate , therefore great self-perceived readiness discharge , . Ninety-nine patient recruit participate intervention-based study . Patients identified surgeon potential participant , refer study coordinator . The study coordinator obtain informed sign consent patient 's physician appointment clinical office . At point , participant medical information collect participant ask complete EORTC QLQ C-30 Quality Life ( QOL ) questionnaire . Participants randomly assign one three intervention group . The intervention group : G0 ( intervention ) , G1 ( minimal intervention ) G2 ( maximal intervention ) . Participants G0 group receive standard clinical care outline present nursing clinical pathway sheet , include pre-operative video expect post-operatively . G1 participant receive standard clinical care G0 patient , also receive personal ambulation goal sheet log book help monitor rate mobility achievement daily goal . G2 participant receive care G1 patient , also receive daily visit study coordinator help monitor physical activity motivate achieve goal . Patients level intervention fill questionnaire ( T.R.I.M Readiness Discharge Questionnaire , title T.R.I.M . Participant Questionnaire hand participant ) pain , anxiety self-perceived readiness discharge post-operative day 3 5 , day discharge follow-up visit . The T.R.I.M Readiness Discharge Questionnaire contain Short Form - McGill Pain Questionnaire [ Melzack , 1987 ] , Short Form State-Trait Anxiety Index [ Marteau &amp; Bekker , 1992 ] . Moreover , questionnaire asks patient self-perceived readiness discharge . They ask answer question `` Are ready go home ? '' mark X line ( visual analog scale , VAS ) one end line indicate `` Not '' `` Definitely '' . Patients also instructed visitor sign-in -out log sheet outfit pedometer measure number step take day . Also day discharge , patient ask fill EORTC Quality Life questionnaire . Finally , 1 month discharge patient contact follow complete EORTC questionnaire third time along Participant Questionnaire . All individual visit daily study coordinator hospital , record daily step . During daily visit , study coordinator also examine goal participant G2 intervention group . They verbally encourage meet ambulation goal . Those G0 G1 intervention group daily step record . T-tests Chi-Square analysis use mean proportion respectively , determine difference intervention group . Logistic regression analysis carry Pearson 's correlation coefficient calculate examine factor contribute patient 's self-perceived readiness discharge , post-operative Quality Life length stay . Multivariate analysis variance use ambulation rate , visitation rate , pain score , anxiety score readiness discharge examine difference different intervention factor describe patient 's clinical pathway ( i.e . length stay , day analgesic , hospital costs/patient ) .</detailed_description>
