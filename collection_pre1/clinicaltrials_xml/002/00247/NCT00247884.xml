	<brief_summary>The treatment HCV-infected IDUs present multiple challenge , adherence therapy , relapse substance use , re-infection , co-morbid psychiatric disease . Some guideline recommend IDUs offer HCV treatment stop use &gt; 6 month , raise question fairness discrimination . Little publish data exist HCV therapy active IDUs . However , extensive evidence exists , specific program develop , IDUs successfully engage care . In IDUs , strategies show improve adherence include directly-observed therapy ( DOT ) , cash incentive , comprehensive case management . Weekly interferon dose provide mean improve HCV treatment adherence , make DOT approach practical . Within observational , prospective clinical cohort , able identify group IDUs infect HCV genotype 2 3 would benefit treatment infection . We design systematic approach determination appropriateness treatment , refine approach treatment within directly observe therapy ( DOT ) setting , evaluate success approach ( defined achievement Sustained Virologic Response ( SVR ) ) . Taken together , project help define systematic approach HCV infection inner city . The hypothesis development systematic approach diagnosis HCV establishment directly observe therapy ( DOT ) program treatment HCV infection IDUs constitute effective mean control epidemic infection within population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pender Assisted Therapy ( PATh ) - Prospective Study Treatment HCV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We evaluate 200 IDUs receive care clinic . For found carry genotype 2 3 eligible treatment medical ground , evaluate patient bi-weekly case conference . All physician participate study also include . Nursing counsel staff also present . For qualify receive therapy HCV , base Provincial guideline , decision make regard appropriateness begin treatment base physical , mental , social addiction-related factor . Once treatment initiated , primary objective study evaluate relatively high intensity DOT program treatment HCV-infected IDUs . All patient access : full-time primary care physician , half-time specialist physician , immediate access one three full-time nurse one six full-time counsellor . All weekly pegylated interferon injection one two daily dos oral medication administered/witnessed clinic staff . The interferon inject clinic staff nurse , one daily dose ribavirin observe give simultaneously methadone ( patient maintenance therapy agent ) either clinic site community pharmacy , decide individual 's plan care . This plan maintain time initiation HCV therapy . This study evaluate 50 individual infect HCV genotypes 2/3 receive 24 week therapy . The primary outcome evaluation SVR ( undetectable virus 48 week , 24 week cessation therapy ) . Patients enrol PCHC , TPHU CCHC , accord usual site medical care . They assess determine wish participate trial meet inclusion exclusion criterion . They ask provide write , inform consent use document approve Research Ethics Board . Once consent grant , medical evaluation laboratory test complete . Clinical data consist medical history ( include recreational drug use history ) physical examination ( include vital sign , weight height ) . Laboratory evaluation include : confirmation HCV antibody status , viremia genotype ; Hematology ( CBC ) ; Blood Chemistry ( ALT , creatinine , alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin ( direct indirect ) , urea nitrogen , albumin , glucose , sodium , potassium , chloride ) ; ANA , TSH , HBsAg , iron study , ceruloplasmin , AFP , PT/INR , HIV antibody test ( CD4 cell count HIV plasma viral load , know HIV-positive ) ; Urinalysis Toxicology Screen ; Serum pregnancy test woman child-bearing potential . All blood work evaluate treatment efficacy toxicity collect study personnel . This do week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 24 ( frequently clinically indicate ) , accord standard care . All medical follow-up accord standard care . This study involve prospective evaluation HCV therapy patient would receive treatment regardless participation study .</detailed_description>
