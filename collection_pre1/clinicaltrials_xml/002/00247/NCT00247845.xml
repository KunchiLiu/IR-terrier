	<brief_summary>With advent highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , hypothesize consistent use could lead cure HIV infection little three year [ Perelson , 1997 ] . Subsequent research show model incorrect [ Finzi , 1999 ] . In addition , long term use HAART associate significant metabolic abnormality , could lead unintended morbidity , possibly bad one could expect progression untreated HIV-associated immune disease period time [ Carr , 2000 ] . Accordingly , current recommendation antiretroviral therapy become conservative . It suggest person CD4 count &gt; 350 cells/mmÂ³ may safely delay initiation HAART [ Yeni , 2002 ] .However , still require HAART , risk short-term long-term toxicity remain , even full virologic suppression achieve . In set , number switch strategy evaluate ( Negredo et al , 2002 &amp; Martinez et al , 2003 ) , mostly involve single drug substitution protease inhibitor ( PI ) non-nucleoside agent ( NNRTI ) abacavir ( ABC ) . In general term , hae show virologic suppression usually maintain , improvement drug-related side effect , include metabolic toxicity . A number patient currently take effective HAART experience side effect one agent regimen severe enough mandate immediate change regimen , measurable effect qualify life . Over time , effect may impact adherence therapy long-term efficacy . Given recent availability ATV ( +/-RTV ) , daily administration , low pill count favourable side effect profile , use clinical practice part single drug substitution strategies patient exhibit maximal response HAART . There clear need examine practice systematic manner document occurrence , efficacy safety . We hypothesize , patient maximal virologic suppression double class regimen ( include two NRTIs NNRTI PI , boost RTV ) , decision make implement single drug substitution NNRTI PI ATV ( +/- ) , lead improvement objectively measure quality life without negative impact virologic efficacy regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Atazanavir Substitution Intervention ( EASI ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm observational study include 100 subject . After clinical decision make implement single drug substitution ATV +/- RTV , initial screen visit , time study present patient inform consent participation obtain . A number evaluation ( include blood test ) complete definitively assess subject 's eligibility participate protocol . The patient continue current therapy return within next 14 day enrollment visit review blood test result definitively confirm study eligibility . In particular , ascertain continue presence side effect/toxicity motivate consideration change therapy . This , quality life questionnaire ( MOS-HIV ASDM ) administer first time . Once , patient continue current HAART return within next 14 day baseline visit time quality life questionnaire ( MOS-HIV ASDM ) administer , result average obtained time enrollment visit , serve rigorous evaluation patient 's current status . The patient could withdraw study side effect/toxicity motivate consideration change therapy longer present . At baseline visit , patient switch PI NNRTI component regimen ATV ( +/- RTV ) . The decision use boost unboosted ATV protocol leave discretion treat physician . All patient receive ATV ( +/- RTV ) food . The dose unboosted ATV 300 mg ( 2 capsule , 150mg ) plus RTV ( 1 capsule , 100 mg ) . The patient see follow week 4 , 12 , 24 , 32 , 48 baseline visit . They continue new therapy ( include ATV +/- RTV ) entire period observation . Changes NRTI backbone permit without constitute study endpoint , change ATV +/- RTV may require reason efficacy toxicity constitute endpoint , lead patient 's withdrawal study . At study visit , quality life questionnaire ( MOS-HIV ASDM ) administer . The result compare mean result obtain enrollment baseline visit , individual participant serve his/her control . Measures adherence HAART , CD4 cell count HIV plasma viral load also obtain study visit , constitute secondary study endpoint .</detailed_description>
