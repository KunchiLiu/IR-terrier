	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine appropriate radiation implant dose palladium-103 monotherapy . Radiation dose related potential cure . From previously publish study , appear prescribed radiation dose reduce 14-20 % without difference potential cure ( study , dose decreased 10 % ) . Although patient tolerate brachytherapy well , complication appear relate radiation exposure normal structure ( i.e . urethra , rectum proximal penis ) . By reduce prescribe dose , conceivable few patient experience side effect complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pd-103 Dose De-Escalation Early Stage Prostate Cancer : A Prospective Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In calendar year 2003 , approximately 220 , 000 men diagnose prostate cancer approximately 30,000 die . The vast majority men diagnose clinically organ-confined disease potentially curative treatment include radical prostatectomy , external beam radiation therapy brachytherapy . Within uro-oncology community , selection one modality another remain controversial . Over past decade , transperineal ultrasound-guided permanent prostate brachytherapy use either Pd-130 I-125 increasingly utilize definitive management early stage carcinoma prostate gland . This resurgence interest prostate brachytherapy result several technologic advance include evolution transrectal ultrasonography , development close transperineal approach availability sophisticated treatment plan computer . These image planning advance significantly improve accuracy seed placement . In addition , advent CT-based postoperative dosimetry early 1990 's provide unique opportunity evaluate quality proactively predict outcome complication . Prostate brachytherapy represent ultimate 3-dimensional conformal therapy permit dose escalation far exceed modality . Following permanent prostate brachytherapy without supplemental external beam radiation therapy , favorable long term biochemical outcome report patient low , intermediate high risk feature morbidity profile compare favorably compete local modality ( 1,2 ) 2 ) . Although definitive evidence suggest either Pd-103 I-125 efficacious term cure side effects/complications , preliminary result prospective randomized trial suggest Pd-103 may `` dose forgive '' I-125 ( 3 ) . Long-term result demonstrate cancer eradication highly correlate deliver radiation dose . To date , postoperative dosimetry primarily describe term V 100/150/200 ( volume gland receive 100 % , 150 % 200 % prescription dose ) D90 ( dose deliver 90 % prostate gland ) . Following I-125 monotherapy , A D90 great equal 140 Gy ( day 30 dosimetry ) require optimal long-term biochemical control ( 4,5 ) 4 ) 5 ) . A dose 140 Gy represent 96 % standard I-125 prescription dose ( 145 Gy ) . In contrast , follow Pd-103 monotherapy , A D90 great equal 100 Gy ( day 30 dosimetry ) D90 great equal 108 Gy ( median day 22 dosimetry ) report predict optimal biochemical outcome ( 6,7 ) 6 ) 7 ) . These Pd-103 dos represent 80 % 86 % standard monotherapy prescription dose ( 125 Gy ) . In addition , prospective randomize trial demonstrate coverage 90 % prostate 124 Gy Pd-103 yield 98 % change cancer-free three year follow treatment ( 3 ) . Because seed placement uncertainty , however , pre-plans design deliver high radiation dose necessary prostate gland ( 8 ) . Additionally , variable amount edema occur implant procedure , move seed far away , require high plan dose actually need . Delivered radiation dose paramount secure long-term freedom biochemical progression . Previously Merrick colleague report postoperative dosimetric quality Pd-103 I-125 term V 100/150/200 D90 independent prostate size , isotope selection , radiation implant dose prescription , use supplemental external beam radiation therapy , neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy patient age ( 8-12 ) 8 ) 9 ) 10 ) 11 ) 12 ) . These result demonstrate dosimetric reproducibility Pd-103 across implant scenario . A review last 200 consecutive Pd-103 implant Schiffler Cancer Center illustrate similar dosimetric outcome patient implant 125 Gy versus 115 Gy . Although morbidity profile permanent prostate brachytherapy compare favorably compete local modality , side effect complication occur . Delivered radiation dose urethra , rectum proximal penis strongly correlate brachytherapy-related morbidity ( 2 , 13-18 ) 13 ) 14 ) 15 ) 16 ) 17 ) 18 ) . In summary , available literature suggest Pd-103 dos necessary cure care substantially less currently prescribe , postoperative dosimetry consistently demonstrate high intraprostatic dos brachytherapy-related morbidity relate radiation dose normal surround structure . As , propose conduct prospective randomize trial evaluate effect 12 % reduction prescription dose ( 125 Gy vs. 110 Gy ) ultimate cure complication rate low risk prostate cancer ( PSA great equal 10 ng/mL , Gleason score great equal 6 clinical stage T1b-T2b ) . To assure dose adequate , intraoperative postoperative dosimetry perform . Intraoperative dose evaluation allow additional seed implant need achieve minimum require dose .</detailed_description>
