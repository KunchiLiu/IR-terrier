	<brief_summary>We conduct longitudinal study assess immunogenicity standard-titer measles vaccine HIV-infected uninfected Zambian child . The study hypothesis HIV-infected child would higher rate primary secondary measles vaccine failure compare uninfected child , contribute decrease level population immunity measles facilitate measles virus transmission region high HIV prevalence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite great progress measles control sub-Saharan Africa , measles remain significant cause morbidity mortality young child . In region high HIV prevalence , measles virus transmission may sustain despite high immunization coverage rate HIV-infected child important transmitter measles virus . Factors potentially contribute enhance measles virus transmission HIV-infected child include early decline protective maternal antibody titer result susceptibility measles young age , high rate primary secondary measles vaccine failure . To evaluate potential impact HIV-1 epidemic immunity follow measles vaccination , conduct longitudinal study compare primary vaccine failure rate rate antibody decline follow administration standard-titer measles vaccine nine month age HIV-infected HIV-uninfected Zambian child . Our result show child bear HIV-infected woman low level passively-acquired maternal antibody measles virus prior age routine vaccination 9 month , HIV-infected child particularly susceptible measles infancy . This finding support WHO recommendation provide first dose measles vaccine HIV-infected child 6 month . Furthermore , HIV-infected child develop adequate primary antibody responses measles vaccine month follow vaccination lose protective antibody titer two three year age . Mitigating potential impact decrease immunogenicity level population immunity measles virus high mortality rate observe among HIV-infected child . Improved access antiretroviral therapy likely improve survival HIV-infected child without enhance protective immunity measles virus , although yet investigate . We work incorporate finding mathematical model well understand impact HIV-1 epidemic measles control strategy investigate immunologic mechanism impaired memory B cell responses HIV-infected child .</detailed_description>
