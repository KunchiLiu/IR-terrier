	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether rEV131 give nasal spray single dose nostril safe reduce sign symptom allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ) cause allergen challenge . All patient enrol know allergic ragweed pollen give ragweed pollen extract nostril 30 minute either rEV131 innactive vehicle ( placebo ) . The sign symptom ( sneeze , itch , stuffiness runny nose ) give score 0 3 patient add together combined score patient treat rEV131 compare receive placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study rEV131 Allergic Rhinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : rEV131 , histamine binding protein ( derive tick saliva ) affinity histamine 10 – 100 fold natural histamine receptor , might attenuate Nasal Allergen Challenge ( NAC ) induce allergic rhinitis . Methods : Patients know ragweed allergy screen determine minimal threshold concentration ( PD30 ) pollen extract consistently induce four key symptom allergic rhinitis : itch , sneeze , congestion mucus production . A standardised system TNSS scoring use . A total 112 eligible patient randomise double blind fashion receive one four concentration rEV131 ( 0.63 , 1.25 , 2.5 5.0 mg/ml ) nasal spray 30 minute prior NAC placebo . Symptoms score 15 , 30 45 minute post NAC . Mean sum symptom score active medication treat patient compare placebo treated patient . The primary analysis sum score 15 minute post challenge optimum concentration rEV131 . Secondary outcome variable include comparison individual symptom percentage patient clinically significant response .</detailed_description>
