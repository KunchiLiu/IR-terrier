	<brief_summary>Brachytherapy recent technique use treatment tumour involve use radioactive source bring close contact target tissue . One principal benefit brachytherapy high radiation dos localise within tumour consequence minimal side effect . 32P radionuclide ideal brachytherapy high energy beta emit property , typically maximum tissue range 8 mm half life 14.3 day . 32P BioSiliconTM active implantable medical device encapsulate 32P within internal microcrystalline structure highly pure inert silicon act seal source provision 32 phosphorous . Tumours target 32P BioSiliconTM hypothesize show reduction volume low incidence side effect associate treatment . Prolongation survival improve quality life would favourable outcomes investigational product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study enroll 48 50 patient site . Patients enrol sequentially three group , start wth Group 1 investigate low radioactivity level progress high radioactivity level Group 2 Group 3 . The approval enrol patient next group assess determine Data Monitoring Board . All patient follow 52 week start date primary implantation . Patients receive intratumoural implantation 32P BioSiliconTM image guidance local anaesthesia designate interventional radiologist , use SIMPL needle conventional needle depend size location tumour assess designate interventional radiologist . There designated number site perform implantation procedure although multiple site recruit follow patient . - Tumour assessment , tumour calculation measurement perform independent radiologist . CT scan participate site send DICOM format designate radiologist assessment . - Safety assessment grade CTCAE perform investigator patient throughout entire study period . There interim analysis patient complete 24 week evaluate safety profile target tumour response patient . - 32P BioSiliconTM prepare designated personnel license handle radioactive product radioactive waste hand manage per institution 's guideline compliance local regulatory requirement .</detailed_description>
