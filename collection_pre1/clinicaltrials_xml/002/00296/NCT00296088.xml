	<brief_title>Effects Obesity Care Outcomes Mechanically Ventilated Individuals Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty-four percent American adult overweight obese . Excess weight soon surpass smoking common cause preventable death . Despite well-known health consequence obesity , little know specific effect obesity critically ill individual . There significant difference ventilator management procedure among obese non-obese individual ICU . The long-term effect difference , however , study . Preliminary research show difference mechanical ventilation process may responsible bad outcome obese individual , compare non-obese individual . The purpose study examine effect obesity ventilator management process medical outcome individual ICU . The study also identify increased risk critically ill obese cause augment mortality morbidity level . This study enroll individual ICU receive mechanical ventilation endotracheal tube . Because potential participant critically ill , unable provide consent participate study , participant must surrogate decision maker provide consent behalf . Once enrol , participant ' weight , height , waist circumference measure . Medical outcomes information process ventilator management care assess participant ICU . Information hospital outcome , quality life , utility , employment , live situation collect upon release ICU , well follow-up telephone interview , occur every 90 day period two year .</detailed_description>
