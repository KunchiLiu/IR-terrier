	<detailed_description>Public information campaign often warn people false unreliable medical claim juxtapose “ myth ” “ facts. ” The effectiveness communication rarely assess . We assess whether people systematically misremember “ myth ” ( false information ) true , assess effect perception risk behavioral intention . In experimental study , participant read either publish CDC flyer “ Facts Myths ” flu vaccine , “ Facts Only ” version ; separate control group read flyer . Participants complete outcome measure either immediately 30 minute . Primary measure memory information flu present flyer , rating perceive risk associate flu , personal intention get vaccinate upcoming season . After delay 30 minute , participant read “ Facts Myths ” flyer systematically misremember myths fact . Both version flyer immediate effect increase intention get flu vaccine , compare control group . After 30 minute , however , participant read “ Facts Myths ” flyer report low intention get vaccinate , compare read fly delay , compare participant read “ Facts Only ” flyer . In sum , people show bias think incompletely remember information true , turn “ myth ” “ facts. ” Hence public information campaign emphasize information true . Repeating false information , even warn , create unintended consequence belief information .</detailed_description>
