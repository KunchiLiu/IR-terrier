	<brief_title>Phase II High-Dose Cyclophosphamide Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) major disable neurologic disease young adult , represent common immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinate disorder central nervous system ( CNS ) . Active inflammatory lesion contain component include T cell , macrophage , activate microglia . Within lesion myelin remove , axon damage oligodendrocyte may lose . In lesion undergo inflammatory demyelination axonal injury also occur . The disability MS produce underscore nearly fifty percent patient require ambulatory aid within 15 year disease onset . Currently , cure MS . Therapy target change short-term natural history MS : decrease attack rate postpone long-term disability . At present , interferon beta glatiramer acetate form foundation therapy relapse MS. Mitoxantrone approve severe case relapse MS , rapidly accumulate neurologic impairment . High-dose cyclophosphamide ( HDC ) non-bone marrow transplant treatment option afflict severe , refractory immune-mediated illness pathologic autoreactive lymphocyte . The goal therapy induce immunoablation without myeloablation : , eradicate offend B T cell responsible illness spar pluripotent blood stem cell ill effect . Since 1966 , multiple publication numerous immune-mediated illness show HDC without stem-cell rescue decrease disease activity improve quality life In protocol study HDC severe , refractory MS . The primary goal ass safety HDC population , data exists regard tolerability high-dose chemotherapy without stem-cell rescue . The treatment goal induce disease regression ( resolution fix neurologic deficit ) , rather stop disease progression without remittive therapy .</detailed_description>
