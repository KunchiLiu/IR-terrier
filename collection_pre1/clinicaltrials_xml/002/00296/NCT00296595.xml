	<brief_summary>Diet long use way provide enough nutrient individual order meet metabolic requirement . However , recent scientific advancement suggest beyond meet nutrition need , diet may also health promote modulation various body function . In way , role nutrition evolve hunger satisfaction maintenance body integrity promotion state well-being prevention important chronic disease cancer , diabetes cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . In recent year , n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) attract much attention consumption n-3 PUFA rich diet report reduce CVD risk . However , n-3 PUFA also highly susceptible free radical damage therefore could unable fully exert health benefit oxidative stress condition . The general objective present application investigate mechanisms n-3 PUFA improve cardiovascular health abdominal obesity explore potential dietary antioxidant modulate effect individual high risk oxidative stress . For purpose , plan study change fast postprandial plasma lipoprotein-lipid level , marker lipid lipoprotein oxidation , inflammation endothelial dysfunction follow 12 week n-3 PUFA supplementation without low-calorie cranberry juice cocktail ( source antioxidant ) group 160 men . We feel present study broaden understanding physiological mechanism underlie beneficial effect consume unsaturated fatty acid give insight role antioxidant preserve potentiate cardiovascular health benefit .</brief_summary>
