	<brief_summary>Patients cardiac surgery correct heart disease may suffer decline mental neurologic ability . Passage small particle fat , tissue waste air bubble brain heart-lung machine think one cause decline mental neurologic ability ( function brain ) surgery . The purpose study determine replacement cardiotomy suction ( one part heart-lung machine ) cell-saver ( different part heart-lung machine ) surgery help prevent decline mental neurologic ability surgery . investigate 312 patient 2 year , patient assign randomly either cardiotomy suction cell-saver group . Patients give questionnaire surgery , 6 week 1-year surgery . These questionnaire assess memory , attention span , ability concentrate quality life . Patients also brief neurologic exam ( physical examination check mental state , reflex , strength , balance ) surgery , 3-5 day surgery , 6 week 1-year surgery determine change . Cell-saver separate red blood cell tissue waste product fat prior return blood back patient may reduce negative effect particle fat , tissue waste air bubble brain . Potential benefit cell-saver device use surgery may prevent decrease memory , attention span , ability concentrate result improve quality life surgery . Objectives : The primary aim determine effect continuous flow cell-saver short long term neurocognitive function cardiac surgery , measure precise preoperative postoperative psychometric neurologic testing . Hypothesis : The primary hypothesis : Continuous flow cell-saver reduces postoperative neurocognitive decline follow cardiac surgery . Methodology : 312 inform consenting patient , age &gt; 65 year , schedule coronary artery bypass graft surgery prospectively enrol 2-year period . Patients randomly allocate either continuous flow cell-saver conventional cardiotomy suction ( control ) . Neurological history physical exam complete preoperatively , discharge , 6-weeks 1-year surgery . Transcranial Doppler scan use intraoperative monitoring cerebral embolic load . Transesophageal echocardiography epiaortic scan employed account severity aortic atheroma score . Neurocognitive testing quality life assessment conduct preoperatively , 6-weeks 1-year surgery . Significance : The utilization continuous flow cell-saver may reduce negative effect fat particle , tissue waste air emboli brain .</brief_summary>
