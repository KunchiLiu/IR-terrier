	<brief_title>Therapeutic Study ONO-4819CD Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis relapse disease unknown cause characterize bloody diarrhea . Therapy usually involve 5-aminosalicylates , corticosteroid immunosuppressant . However , steroid resistance dependency become problematic . Immunosuppressive drug , azathioprine , beneficial may serious side effect . Therefore , new therapeutic approach need . Prostaglandin E2 one prostanoids , involve innate immunity . PGE2 induce oral tolerance specific antigen small intestine downregulates production release proinflammatory cytokine macrophage neutrophil . Accordingly , PGE2 consider mediator mucosal protection . Recently , elucidate disruption EP4 gene , one PGE receptor , cause severe colitis mouse . Moreover , EP4-selective agonist ( AE1-734 ) also reveal ameliorate severe dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mouse . We therefore examine effect 2 week intravenous EP4-selective agonist therapy patient mild moderate ulcerative colitis .</detailed_description>
