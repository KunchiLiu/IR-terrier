	<detailed_description>AS developmental disorder affect movement , speech , social demeanor . The disorder cause deficiency maternally transmit gene inherited birth . Children AS , however , often diagnose 3 7 year old . Symptoms AS may include , limited , functionally severe developmental delay ; speech impairment ; movement balance problem ; behavioral uniqueness , include combination frequent laughter smiling , apparent happy demeanor , easily excitable personality , hand flap movement , short attention span . There four molecular variation AS , past clinical study inconsistent highlight phenotypic difference . This study gain good understand disease progression clinical feature AS observe child AS period 5 10 year . The study also attempt establish genotype-phenotype correlation , might aid future clinical care AS patient . Participation observational study limit current future patient one five study site . A clinical evaluation perform baseline , include general patient history , physical neurological examination , nutritional assessment , neuro-imaging , electroencephalography , laboratory testing , neurodevelopmental testing . A blood sample mucosal sample also take baseline acquire DNA potential genetic testing . All assessment except neuro-imaging , electroencephalography , blood sampling repeat yearly study visit long fund secure . In addition , participant photograph perhaps videotape yearly basis order document clinical phenotype neurologic abnormality . Participants may followed-up total 10 year .</detailed_description>
