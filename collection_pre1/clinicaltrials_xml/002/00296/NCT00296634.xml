	<detailed_description>This randomize , control , double-blinded , dose-ranging , Phase I/II study healthy adult , 18 49 year old , design investigate safety , reactogenicity , dose-related immunogenicity investigational inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine give alone combine aluminum hydroxide . The primary objective : determine dose-related safety subvirion-inactivated H5N1 vaccine adjuvanted aluminum hydroxide healthy adult ; determine potential aluminum hydroxide enhance immune response subvirion-inactivated H5N1 vaccine healthy adult approximately 1 month follow receipt 2 dos vaccine ; provide information selection best dosage level study . The secondary objective evaluate dose-related immunogenicity percent subject respond approximately 1 7 month first vaccination . This dose optimization apply young old subject population subsequent study . Subjects meet entry criterion study randomize 8 group receive 2 dos influenza A/H5N1 vaccine contain 3.75 , 7.5 , 15 , 45 mcg hemagglutinin ( HA ) without aluminum hydroxide adjuvant intramuscular ( IM ) injection ( N=60 120/vaccine dose group ) . The first vaccination occur Day 0 . Symptoms sign assess clinic least 15 minute inoculation , subject maintain memory aid record oral temperature systemic local adverse event ( AEs ) 7 day immunization . Subjects encouraged take temperature around time day . All subject return clinic 2 day 8 day vaccination assessment adverse event ( AEs ) concomitant medication target physical examination ( indicate ) . Memory aid review visit . Approximately Day 28 first vaccination , subject return clinic blood sample collection safety follow-up , follow second vaccination . Approximately 56 day first immunization ( 28 day second vaccination ) , subject return clinic immunogenicity blood sample collection , AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination ( indicate ) . At approximately Day 208 ( 7 month first vaccination ) , subject return clinic final immunogenicity blood sample collection follow-up ( include target physical examination [ indicate ] ) . Blood sample collect prior vaccination Days 56 208 first vaccination test central laboratory level neutralize HAI antibody . The primary outcome measure frequencies severity AEs group proportion subject achieve serum neutralize antibody titer great equal 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus Day 56 . Serum HAI neutralize antibody response ( include frequency 4 fold great rise titer ; geometric mean titer ; proportion subject achieve putative protective titer neutralize antibody 1 month dose vaccine 7 month first dose ) also assess . Although correlate protection infection cause influenza A/H5N1 virus human unknown , serum neutralize antibody titer great equal 1:40 may consider protective , base limited data regard level serum neutralize antibody present serum sample collect human survive infection cause influenza A/H5N1 virus . This study link DMID protocol 07-0022 .</detailed_description>
