	<brief_summary>Despite many available treatment , patient major depression remain treatment refractory chronically disable . For severely ill patient , several neurosurgical procedure available brain lesion make interrupt white matter tract link orbital frontal cortex striatum , result significant therapeutic benefit many patient . In study , test safety efficacy Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) -- reversible method use modulate brain activity -- alternative standard subcaudate tractotomy ( SCT ) . The physiological consequence procedure map longitudinally use positron emission tomography ( PET ) measure brain glucose metabolism . Patients clinically monitor 1 year longitudinal psychiatric , neurological , neurosurgical , neuropsychological PET image examination assess treatment efficacy side effect .</brief_summary>
