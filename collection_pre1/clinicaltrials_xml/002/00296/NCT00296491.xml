	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject consider eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Consent : A sign date write informed consent must obtain subject subject 's legally acceptable representative prior study participation . An informed consent must sign prior change subject 's medication regimen , include withhold medication prior Visit 1 . Gender : Male female . Females eligible participate currently pregnant lactating . Females childbearing potential require use highly effective method avoid pregnancy ( i.e. , contraception failure rate &lt; 1 % per year ) . Female subject childbearing potential undergo urine pregnancy test Visits 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Any female becomes pregnant study withdrawn . Female subject enrol plan become pregnant time study participation . Age : 15 year old . Asthma Diagnosis : A diagnosis persistent asthma , least three month , define following American Thoracic Society definition : Asthma clinical syndrome characterize increased responsiveness tracheobronchial tree variety stimulus . The major symptom asthma paroxysms dyspnea , wheeze , cough , may vary mild almost undetectable severe unremitting ( status asthmaticus ) . The primary physiological manifestation hyperresponsiveness variable airway obstruction . This take form spontaneous fluctuation severity obstruction , substantial improvement severity obstruction follow bronchodilator corticosteroid , increase obstruction cause drug stimuli [ American Thoracic Society , 1987a ] . NOTE : Intermittent seasonal asthma , well exerciseinduced bronchospasm alone , exclude . Asthma Therapy : 3 month ' prior current use one follow asthma therapy , change regimen month prior Visit 1 : Scheduled asneeded inhaled oral shortacting beta2agonist ( SABA ) . Subjects must able replace current shortacting beta2agonist albuterol/salbutamol , use asneeded basis duration study . Allowed noncorticosteroid controller therapy ( e.g. , anticholinergic cromolyn ) . One follow inhaled corticosteroid take correspond daily dose : criterion . Inhaled Corticosteroid ( Total Daily Dose ) Beclomethasone dipropionate ( ≤420mcg ) Beclomethasone dipropionate HFA ( ≤240mcg ) Budesonide ( ≤400mcg ) Flunisolide ( ≤1000mcg ) Fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol ( ≤220mcg ) Fluticasone propionate inhalation powder ( ≤250mcg ) Mometasone furoate ( ≤220mcg ) Triamcinolone acetonide ( ≤1000mcg ) Subjects take ADVAIR 100/50mcg BID eligible replace ADVAIR FLOVENT HFA 110mcg BID 14 day prior Visit 1 . This change Investigator 's clinical discretion , take individual 's current past asthma stability account . The subject must aware risk benefit switch medication acknowledge sign informed consent prior change subject 's medication regimen . Asthma Severity : An FEV1 65 % 95 % predict value Visit 1 withhold asthma medication detail protocol . At Visit 2 , subject must also experience minimum asthma symptom define Section 5.2.3 , `` Randomization Criteria '' , Section 6.2 protocol . Predicted FEV1 base National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) predict normal value [ Hankinson , 1999 ] . Rhinitis Diagnosis : A diagnosis seasonal allergic rhinitis define follow : A clinical history ( write verbal confirmation ) allergic rhinitis seasonal onset offset nasal allergy symptom previous 2 relevant allergy season ( capture source document ) . AND •A positive skin test reaction geographically relevant seasonal allergen , determine skin prick method , within 24 month prior Visit 1 . For purpose study , positive skin test reaction define wheal diameter least 3mm great diluent control use 1:20 W : V glycerinated solution . •At Visit 2 , subject must also experience minimum rhinitis symptom define Section 5.2.3 , `` Randomization Criteria '' , Section 6.2 protocol . Geographical Location : Active residence within geographical region exposure relevant seasonal allergen expect significant entire study period . Note : The principal investigator responsible track record pollen count geographically relevant seasonal allergen throughout entire study . Alternatively , information may obtain reputable source within geographical area . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Currently Diagnosed LifeThreatening Asthma : An episode episodes asthma require intubation associate hypercapnia , respiratory arrest , hypoxic seizure . Asthma Instability : Hospitalization asthma within 6 month Visit 1 . Concurrent Respiratory Disease : Current evidence pneumonia , pneumothorax , atelectasis , pulmonary fibrotic disease , chronic bronchitis , emphysema , respiratory abnormality asthma . Nasal Obstruction : Severe physical obstruction nose ( e.g. , deviated septum ) could affect deposition doubleblind intranasal study drug . Nasal History : History nasal septal perforation recent nasal septal surgery . Other Concurrent Conditions/Diseases : Any evidence rhinitis medicamentosa , history glaucoma and/or cataract ocular herpes simplex , clinically significant , uncontrolled condition disease state , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk study participation would confound interpretation result condition/disease exacerbate study . The list additional excluded conditions/diseases include , limited : cardiac arrhythmia ; congestive heart failure ; coronary artery disease ; poorly control diabetes , poorly control hypertension , poorly control peptic ulcer , hematologic , hepatic , renal disease ; immunologic compromise ; current malignancy ; current quiescent tuberculosis , Cushing 's Addison 's disease . Drug Allergy : Any immediate delay hypersensitivity beta2agonist , sympathomimetic drug , leukotriene modifier , intranasal , inhale , systemic corticosteroid therapy , sensitivity aspirin NSAIDS . Subjects severe milk protein allergy also exclude participation . Respiratory Tract Infections : Any sinus , middle ear , oropharyngeal , upper low respiratory tract infection resolve least 14 day immediately precede Visit 1 , antibiotic therapy complete least 14 day prior Visit 1 . Concurrent Medications : Concurrent use follow medication may affect course asthma , rhinitis , interact sympathomimetic amine montelukast . Betablockers tricyclic antidepressant monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenobarbital rifampin ritonavir ketoconazole Systemic Corticosteroids : Use oral parenteral systemic corticosteroid within 28 day Visit 1 , requirement two course parenteral systemic corticosteroid asthma within 6 month Visit 1 . NOTE : Topical hydrocortisone cream ointment ( 1 % less ) permit study . Excluded Rhinitis Medications : The follow rhinitis medication must withhold correspond `` exclusion period '' prior Visit 1 allow time study , unless dispense doubleblind study drug : Medication ( Exclusion Period Prior Visit 1 ) Intranasal ocular corticosteroid ( 28 day ) Leukotriene modifier ( e.g. , Singulair , Accolate , Zyflo ) ( 28 day ) Intranasal ocular cromolyn ( 14 day ) Longacting antihistamine ( e.g. , loratadine , cetirizine ) ( 10 day ) Shortacting antihistamine ( include prescription OTC ) ( 72 hour ) Oral intranasal decongestant ( 72 hour ) Intranasal anticholinergic ( e.g. , Atrovent ) ( 24 hour ) Excluded Asthma Medications : The follow asthma medication must withhold correspond `` exclusion period '' prior Visit 1 . These asthma medication , exception inhale corticosteroid/longacting beta2agonist combination product Xolair , may continue runin period study ( Visits 1 2 ) , must withhold prior Visit 2 appropriate `` exclusion period '' show . These asthma medication allow time randomization Visit 2 ( exception asneeded rescue albuterol/salbutamol ) , unless dispense doubleblind study drug : Medicationª ( Exclusion Period Prior Visit 1 and/or Visit 2 ) Inhaled corticosteroid/longacting beta2agonist combination product ( e.g. , ADVAIR ) ( 14 day ) Inhaled anticholinergic ( e.g. , Atrovent , Combivent , Spiriva ) ( 24 hour ) Theophylline product ( 48 hour ) Inhaled cromolyn nedocromil ( 24 hour ) Inhaled corticosteroid ( 12 hour ) Longacting beta2agonists ( e.g. , Foradil , SEREVENT™ ) ( 14 day ) Oral beta2agonists ( 12 hour ) Inhaled shortacting beta2agonists^b ( e.g. , Proventil ) ( 6 hour ) Xolair ( 12 month ) 1 . For leukotriene modifier `` exclusion period '' prior Visit 1 , refer Exclusion Criterion 11 . 2 . Replaced Visit 1 albuterol/salbutamol . Ophthalmic preparation : Use artificial tear , eyewash , homeopathic preparation , irrigation solution , lubricant , sympathomimetic preparation , vasoconstrictor , combination aforementioned product study .
