	<detailed_description>It accept patient DM associate great risk morbidity mortality hyperlipidemia , compromise graft function , stroke , nephropathy , atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , graft-loss , infection , retinopathy , neuropathy , gastropathy , vascular complications.2 Patients pre-existing DM 1.9 time less survival days.3 In renal transplantation , twice many patient pre-existing diabetes die function graft.4 DM show predominantly single important predictor adverse outcomes term mortality morbidity result various end organ damage . Poor DM control lead increase risk graft loss patient death due manifestation end-stage DM.8 Chronic Allograft Nephritis ( CAN ) common find 6th month post kidney transplant , especially patient blood glucose metabolism abnormality . Several condition may lead worsen diabetes transplantation . First , patient ESRD improvement kidney function kidney transplantation lead also increase clearance circulate insulin . Second , patient experience significant improvement well successful transplantation . Often appetite significantly improve , result significant weight gain - increase insulin demand resistance . Finally , immunosuppressive medication diabetogenic . Corticoid-steroids well know strong diabetogenic effect associate post transplant diabetes . Calcineurin inhibitor corner stone immunosuppression organ transplantation . This class medication include cyclosporine tacrolimus . Both associated post transplantation diabetes . Induction agent , include polyclonal antibody ( ex . Thymoglobulin ) monoclonal antibody ( ex . Anti Il-2 receptor , Zenapax , Simulect ) find cause hyperglycaemia . The two area possible intervention minimize bad diabetes transplantation thus limited 1 ) comprehensive diabetes education 2 ) new immunosuppressive regimen transplantation . 1.1 Comprehensive Diabetes Education : DM arise stressful time organ failure post-transplant phase . During prospective study conduct solid organ transplant recipient pre-existing post transplant diabetes observe follow trend : - The complex nature organ transplantation carry potential side effect , amenable early intervention post transplant setting patient diabetes education monitoring transplant team . - Patients poorly control diabetes post transplant high incidence post transplant morbidity . Our study show 7 % DM-related re-admissions within one year post-transplant patient Diabetes Transplant Program , compare 93 % DM-related re-admission rate within one year patient enrol Program.10 Further analysis Stanford Medical Center 's Transplant Diabetes Program reveal patient ' average HbA1c 8.8 % intake program . Patients follow multi disciplinary Transplant Diabetes education team result average value 7.2 % follow minimum three month management . 11 1.2 Immunosuppression Transplant Patients Diabetes : The utilization calcineurin inhibitor combination steroid contribute improved success transplantation see since introduction cyclosporine 1983 . Prograf , also calcineurin inhibitor introduce later ( 1989 ) associate improvement result . Newer immunosuppressive medication introduce since . There interest transplant community use new agent achieve steroid minimization avoidance . These strategy appeal diabetic patient steroid calcineurin inhibitor diabetogenic medication receive transplantation . 1.2.1 STEROIDS Stanford 's Pediatric kidney transplant team demonstrate feasibility steroid avoidance rapid taper kidney transplantation . Doctor Salvatierra team substitute Zenapax induction therapy steroid series pediatric kidney transplant recipient . Patients receive well tacrolimus MMF prophylaxis rejection . They initially report experience first 34 patient ( 5-21 year old ) treat protocol . The graft survival 100 % incidence acute rejection rejection 6 % compare 15 % historical control receive steroid . They post transplantation diabetes high blood pressure , cholesterol lower , obesity appearance also significantly better.12 Steroid avoidance standard treatment Stanford 's Pediatric Transplant Program . The adult Kidney Transplant Program able reproduce pediatric experience similarly design steroid avoidance protocol . A slightly different approach also successfully use . Kidney transplant recipient receive Thymoglobulin induction lieu Zenapax receive 4 small dos steroids peri-operatively . So far 25 patient treat minimal exposure steroid . The graft patient survival 100 % one episode rejection see . This approach prefer total avoidance steroid since associate well initial kidney function.13 This late approach currently use Stanford 's Adult Kidney Transplant Program un-sensitized adult patient receive kidney transplant medical condition could exacerbate use steroid ; diabetes , obesity , osteopenia , coronary artery disease . Utilisation Thymoglobulin associate low incidence acute rejection IL-2RA . Xiao et Al show absence Post Transplant Diabetes Mellitus ( PTDM ) decrease use anti-hypertensive medication steroid free group . Minimization steroid use clear metabolic benefit diabetic patient . Within Stanford University Transplant service enough experience support safe use . In study , patient minimal exposure steroid . We opt give peri-operative steroid ( 4 dos total ) experience approach associate well initial graft function complete steroid avoidance . We also elect use induction therapy Thymoglobulin associate low rate rejection rate mention studies.14 1.2.2 Calcineurin inhibitor Calcineurin inhibitor also associate post transplant diabetes . The incidence PTDM report 30 % depend calcineurin inhibitor use , ( Cyclosporine vs. Prograf ) , trough level , race , risk factor diabetes contribute number . These figure may underestimate true incidence PTDM , study utilize strict criterion ADA diagnosis diabetes . Most study report high incidence PTDM use Prograf compare Cyclosporine . The great diabetogenicity Prograf confirm recent study investigate new onset diabetes kidney transplant.14 study reveal incidence new-onset diabetes 70 % high Prograf treat patient patient receive Neoral.16 This contrast study mention Prograf use steroid free protocol low incidence post transplant diabetes . Calcineurin inhibitor remain corner stone immunosuppression present time , even context steroid minimization . It would thus important determine one two calcineurin inhibitor available market favourable metabolic profile specifically patient pre-existing diabetes . Direct comparison Neoral ( micro-emulsion formulation CSA ) Prograf never make context short steroid taper specifically non-insulin dependent diabetic patient . Equitable comparison Neoral Prograf difficult , drug pharmacokinetic profile . Trough ( pre-dose ) level use evaluate drug exposure make dosage adjustment . Prograf predictive correlation trough level total area curve ( total drug exposure patient ) Neoral . C2 monitor CSA consist measure drug level 2 hour ingestion . The correlation C2 monitoring Neoral area curve similar correlation trough Prograf area curve ( R 2=0.92 ) . C2 monitor Neoral associated increase efficacy reduction toxicity . In study use C2 monitoring Neoral trough monitoring Prograf . Moderate minimization calcineurin inhibitor dosage use study order reduce deleterious effect calcineurin inhibitor metabolism glucose . A reduction approximately 20 % usual target level use . 1.2.3 Cellcept ( MMF ) Utilization MMF combination Prograf Neoral standard treatment kidney transplantation . Mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) active component MMF . Therapeutic drug monitoring MPA show reduce rejection toxicity.15 Furthermore ; cyclosporine interfere MPA metabolism result low exposure drug compare patient receive Prograf fix dose use . MPA monitoring may thus ensure patient study within therapeutic window immunosuppressive agent . This may prove even crucial receiving steroid . MPA monitoring also ensure Neoral Prograf group receive similar drug exposure MPA . 1.2.4 Conclusion Patients diabetes high risk morbidity mortality kidney transplantation . Currently , publish data morbidity mortality high risk patient prospective study utilizes American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) criteria diabetes management control , address : - The impact steroids elimination outcome kidney transplantation metabolic control patient pre-existing type 2 diabetes . - Optimization CI therapy post transplant patient pre-existing type 2 DM impact metabolic control . The propose study compare effect Calcineurin inhibitor metabolic control absence corticosteroid well optimize post-transplant patient outcome decrease morbidity patient DM . With close monitoring transplant recipient immunosuppression protocol , elimination CS reduction CI therapy , propose decrease patient morbidity associate DM . The finding study may help : - Identify optimal immunosuppression therapy transplant patient diabetes - Decrease DM relate co-morbidities hospital readmission - Increase longevity life graft survival transplant recipient DM . - Lower overall post-transplant health care cost attribute morbidity immunosuppression therapy diabetes . - Promote well DM self-care transplant process - Results study 100 % studied population diabetic may provide insight metabolism glucose transplantation result well understand post transplant diabetes .</detailed_description>
