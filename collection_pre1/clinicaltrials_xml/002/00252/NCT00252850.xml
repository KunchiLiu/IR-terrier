	<brief_summary>This Phase I dose escalate open-label study design assess safety , tolerability biologic activity vivo AAV2 mediate delivery gene encode NTN ( CERE-120 ) . Twelve ( 18 ) subject receive one two open-label dos CERE-120 via bilateral stereotactic injection target putaminal region brain . Subjects enrol one two cohort , low-dose cohort six subject follow high dose cohort six subject . The design study primary objective , evaluation safety tolerability , assess frequent observation adverse event , clinical laboratory test result , image ( MRI ) , neuropsychometric testing , evaluation disease status .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis bilateral idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease least 5 year duration since diagnosis motor fluctuation , despite adequate oral antiparkinsonian therapy . Diagnosis moderate severe Parkinson 's Disease base clinical rating scale . Males nonpregnant female 3575 year age , inclusive . Stable medication requirement , clear response antiparkinsonian medication 60day eligibility evaluation period . No condition would render subject unsuitable surgery , would interfere assessment safety efficacy trial . Subject 's informed consent prior performance studyspecific procedure . A history clinically significant medical , psychiatric , laboratory abnormality participation study would pose safety risk subject . History treatment Parkinson 's disease procedure involve intracranial surgery implantation device . MRI brain within 12 month anticipate dosing procedure indicate presence abnormality may interfere assessment safety efficacy would , judgment investigator , present surgical risk subject . Any disorder precludes surgical procedure alters wound heal . A score less equal 25 Folstein MiniMental examination perform eligibility evaluation period . Chemotherapy , cytotoxic therapy , immunotherapy within 6 week prior CERE120 administration . Vaccinations within 30 day prior CERE120 administration . History , within two year anticipate dosing procedure , drug alcohol abuse . Treatment nonantiparkinsonian agent may affect symptom Parkinson 's disease within 60 day anticipate dosing procedure . Any medical disability would interfere assessment safety efficacy trial would compromise ability subject undergo study procedure ( e.g . MRI , PET ) give inform consent . History prior gene transfer therapy . Treatment investigational agent within 60 day anticipate dosing procedure .</criteria>
