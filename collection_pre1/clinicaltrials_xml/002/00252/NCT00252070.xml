	<brief_title>Fitness Exercise People With Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There evidence people arthritis participate appropriate type physical activity improve physical function pain management . Most existing program focus improve flexibility balance . Less attention pay condition overall functional fitness . To address concern , study develop , evaluate , implement non-aquatic physical activity program increase health-related functional fitness community-dwelling adult arthritis . Specific goal : 1 . To develop systematic progressive program ( FEPA : Functional Exercise Persons Arthritis ) integrate muscular aerobic conditioning , balance trunk/pelvic stabilization exercise emphasize joint-protective , multi-plane movement pattern mimic use everyday activity . 2 . Implement FEPA program ethnically diverse , low SES community sample old adult arthritis . 3 . Conduct process , outcomes impact evaluation ass effectiveness FEPA program increase short- immediate-term health functional fitness outcome . 4 . Evaluate sustainability FEPA program program logic model process identify input , activity output contribute successful program implementation build community capacity support long-term program maintenance .</detailed_description>
