	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 study determine sensitivity specificity Aridol bronchial challenge test detect bronchial hyperresponsiveness patient suspect asthma . Patients suspect asthma either gender , age 6 50 year , mildly impaired lung function ( FEV1 &gt; 70 % ) test three different bronchial hyperresponsiveness challenge ( Aridol , exercise methacholine ) , result compare . A clinical diagnosis also make end study .</brief_summary>
