	<brief_title>Doxil Topotecan Doublet Cancer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topotecan semisynthetic analogue camptothecin . Like parent compound camptothecin , topotecan specific inhibitor topoisomerase-I . Topoisomerase-I facilitates DNA replication induce reversible single strand break thereby relieve torsional strain occur ahead move replication fork DNA replication . Topotecan bind topoisomerase-I DNA complex prevents relegation single strand break result double strand DNA break . The cytotoxic action topotecan proportional cellular level topoisomerase-I . Doxorubicin anthracycline antibiotic wide range clinical activity . The mechanism cytotoxicity exact intracellular target remain controversial . The bulk intracellular drug intranuclear much intercalate DNA . Although DNA intercalation felt principle cytotoxic mechanism , recent evidence suggest inhibition topoisomerase-II may play important role . Additionally , cytotoxic action include helicase inhibition recently note . Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil ) polyethylene glycol pegylated liposomal encapsulation doxorubicin . This result alteration pharmacokinetics comparison parent compound . Specifically prolonged circulation time , reduced clearance , small volume distribution , limited uptake reticuloendothelial system . In animal use ovarian xenograft nude mouse , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin result great tumor normal tissue drug uptake improve therapeutic index . Following phase I study , Doxil recently study phase II study heavily pre-treated ovarian carcinoma patient response rate 25.7 % . This level activity meet exceed second-line agent currently available . In recent phase II study , dose 50 mg/m2 every 3 week utilized . Topotecan give 5 daily infusion associate significant myelosuppression poor patient acceptance . Non hematologic toxicity usually mild dose-limiting . Although 5 day schedule inconvenient , relative lack acute toxicity still make topotecan good candidate out-patient chemotherapy select patient . Although impact bone marrow suppression minimize use cytokine , 5 day regimen require substantial dose reduction . In view bone marrow toxicity see topotecan poor patient acceptance five day schedule , interest development effective alternate treatment regimen use topotecan . Results preclinical study suggest repeat administration topotecan necessary activity . A phase I study evaluate safety efficacy weekly bolus topotecan second line agent relapse ovarian cancer result maximum tolerate dose 5 mg/m2 . A phase II study relapse ovarian cancer support use weekly topotecan dose 3 - 4.0 mg/m2/week . Toxicities weekly regime include , grade 3 4 neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia , fatigue GI toxicity , occur follow less 1 % treatment . The combination topoisomerase-I topoisomerase-II inhibitor attractive strategy cancer chemotherapy . A phase II study evaluate combination pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30mg/m2/week topotecan 1 mg/m2 IV 5 consecutive day give every 28 day . Twelve patient platinum resistant ovarian cancer treat . Partial response observe three patient four patient stable disease ten patient evaluate response . Toxicities include high percentage bone marrow toxicity ( grade III/IV neutropenia , grade III/IV thrombocytopenia ) toxicity include alopecia diarrhea grade II/III . The author conclude combination topotecan pegylated liposomal doxorubicin active treatment platinum resistant ovarian cancer . However , myelosuppression require dose reduction nearly half patient . As mention earlier , weekly regimen topotecan allow convenient administration prolong complex administration schedule . The current study evaluate tolerability weekly intravenous schedule topotecan combination standard dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin advance solid tumor . Due addition pegylated liposomal doxorubicin weekly schedule topotecan , Pharmacokinetics data also obtain .</detailed_description>
