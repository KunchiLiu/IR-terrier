	<detailed_description>Background . Cannabis widely use illicit substance whole Western world rate rise .

With regard treatment research mark deficit handful study date . Only US Australia , recent effort undertake develop evaluate cannabis-specific dependence treatment program control trial highly selective sample . However , currently ‘ state art ’ benchmark program neither Germany European country suitable routine use . Aims . ( 1 ) To develop modular treatment program ( ST/TST ) cannabis use disorder base treatment package component show effective previous US Australian trial , adapt material need target population . ( 2 ) To demonstrate modular treatment package , imply motivational enhancement , cognitive-behavioral psychosocial problem solve component efficacious comparison delay treatment control ( DTC ) group . ( 3 ) Additionally , test whether targeted standardized treatment ( TST ) component tailor address specifically core problem area result superior short term ( 3-months ) outcomes core domain compare ST-group . Method . A randomize control intervention study propose . A total 210 participant randomly assign two , respectively three study condition : 1 . ST ( n=70 ) include motivational enhancement , cognitive-behavioral , psychosocial problem solve treatment component , 2 . TST ( n=70 ) , include component ST partly individually match specific problem profile patient , ( c ) delay treatment control group ( DTC , n=70 ) . Core outcome variable total quit rate , number cannabis use past 4 week , decrease ASI score retention rate . The core hypothesis test combined ST/TST group ( n=140 ) . The ASI serve allocation algorithm TST group serve outcome measure 3rd hypothesis . The propose study innovative result considerable advancement knowledge effective treatment cannabis disorder inform value target individualized allocation .</detailed_description>
