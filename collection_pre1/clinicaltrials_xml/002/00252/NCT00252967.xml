	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether drug , atorvastatin , able reduce rate return abnormal beat use cardioversion . Atorvastatin drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment high cholesterol approve prevent abnormal heartbeat . In addition lower cholesterol , drug reduces inflammation . Inflammation seem help cause atrial fibrillation , certain type abnormal heartbeat . In animal , atorvastatin reduces risk type abnormal beat , preliminary data human support effect atorvastatin similar drug action reduce risk type abnormal beat . We , researcher Emory University , would like learn drug could prevent return abnormal heartbeat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atorvastatin Therapy Prevention Atrial Fibrillation ( SToP-AF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) relate disorder , atrial flutter ( AFlut ) , common abnormal heartbeat . Because similar AFlut rare compare AF , usually treat similarly discuss one disorder . AF extremely common arrhythmia affect 5 % population 65 year age . It independent risk factor death . AF consider progressive disease increase prevalence age convert paroxysmal permanent within single individual . The projected lifetime risk AF 1 4 men . AF occur electrical short circuit top part heart ( atrium ) . This cause atria beat &gt; 300 time per min irregular ineffective manor . This two consequence . The blood tend pool atrium allow clot . Second , bottom part heart ( ventricle ) beat rapidly response impulse arise atrium . The rapid ventricular contraction without adequate filling time result reduce ejection blood . This cause heart failure symptom shortness breath reduce blood flow organ result lightheadedness collapse . One logical therapy correct defect arise AF return abnormal heartbeat back normal rhythm . This do electrical shock therapy ( cardioversion ) drug call antiarrhythmic agent . Often , use together . While stand reason use technique restore rhythm normal would beneficial , clinical trial show leave patient AF thin blood prevent blood clot equally efficacious try restore normal beating ( sinus rhythm ) . The common explanation AF return rapidly despite antiarrhythmic drug antiarrhythmic drug make bad abnormal heart beat , phenomenon know proarrhythmia . Based lack efficacy current therapy similarity risk factor atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) AF , begin investigate whether oxidative stress , mechanism similar inflammation think responsible atherosclerosis , might play role cause AF . We study pig first find put pig AF , large increase oxidative stress marker . Then , make mouse much oxidative stress heart , mouse develop AF . Based data human , hypothesize oxidative stress cause AF . Atorvastatin cholesterol lower medication work block production cholesterol early stage . This effect prevent synthesis molecule require assemble common enzymatic source oxidative stress , NADPH oxidase . Therefore , atorvastatin decrease oxidative stress addition reduce cholesterol , hypothesis correct , atorvastatin reduce incidence AF . In study chose look patient undergoing cardioversion . This group high likelihood recurrence AF would benefit effective drug . Once decision make patient undergo cardioversion , approach patient enrol trial . The change medical therapy addition study drug . The study require alteration standard care . If patient agree participate , start study drug follow recurrence AF variety surface electrocardiogram technique . All noninvasive . To insure medicine cause side effect , examination blood test do , study whether drug actually affect oxidative stress , blood analyze . The subject participation end AF recur 1 year . This double blind , placebo control trial analyze intention treat basis . The risk study patient likely small compare potential benefit reduce AF burden . Based previous trial use dose study medication , risk study drug relate adverse event likely &lt; 3 % . All expect reversible discontinuation drug . The significance research currently treatments address AF less optimal . Antiarrhythmic drug variably effective associate potentially lethal proarrhythmic side effect . The common treatment prevent stroke subject AF chronic warfarin administration , warfarin therapy require frequent monitoring adjustment dose associate bleeding complication . This research may provide first new therapeutic strategy many year AF serious consequence AF , stroke .</detailed_description>
