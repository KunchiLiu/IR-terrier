	<brief_title>The Effect Broccoli Sprouts Nutritional Supplement Prevention Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammation play important role development atherosclerosis . The initial site damage endothelium secondarily rest vascular wall involve . Hypotheses concern development lesion introduce concept oxidative stress , ( `` imbalance oxidant antioxidant favor oxidant , potentially leading damage '' ) key role development atherosclerosis . Consequently , much interest focus attenuate oxidative stress order minimize damage . Clinical trial study effect antioxidant atherosclerotic process , use micronutrient reductive potential , fail demonstrate benefit patient even show increased mortality . An alternative induce endogenous antioxidative defense cell . One possibility increase expression enzymes responsible neutralize oxidative substance , group enzyme relevant path phase 2 enzyme , instance gluthation-s-transferase ( GsT ) . Broccoli sprout high content Glucoraphanin ( GP ) substance ability increase expression GsT . Experiments involve stroke prone hypertensive rat human indicate GP broccoli sprout beneficial effect oxidative stress . In experiment rat consequence protection oxidative stress increase endothelial dependant vasodilation ( EDV ) . This find important low EDV predict development atherosclerosis . We find induction enzyme antioxidant capability could beneficial people atherosclerosis study effect broccoli sprout endothelial function condition endothelial dysfunction important intermediary step clinical study perform . Hypothesis Broccoli sprout contain high level GP induce phase 2 enzyme human endothelium , thereby make endothelium resistant inflammatory damage . Attenuation damage increase nitric oxide ( NO ) bioavailability thus improve EDV patient risk cardiovascular disease . Methods Broccoli sprout harvest 4 day obtain high amount GP per unit dry weight . After harvest , sprout dry order avoid degradation GP content . As placebo , sprout GP content degrade use . The participant receive 10 g dry broccoli sprout per day period four week . 10 g dry sprout GP content equivalent content 1 10 kg fresh broccoli . Blinding participant well investigator insure . Participants : 120 patient three subgroup 40 healthy control give total four group . The group investigate individually , treatment placebo arm . Patients screen interview BP , weight height blood test perform . After informed consent obtain , randomize draw envelope either placebo active ingredient . At begin study every week study , patient examine BP , weight , blood sample assessment EDV use flow mediate dilation ( FMD ) . FMD perform measure increase diameter brachial artery elbow interruption circulation forearm period 5 minute use tourniquet place elbow . Flow brachial artery record immediately circulation restore 15 s. Dilation express ratio relative diameter prior interruption percent . Blood sample analyze GP content metabolite KVL . Statistics We determine σ study less 2.5 comparable result form group . Assuming σ 3 minimal detectable difference 3 % ( usually FMD approximately 5 % ) give power &gt; 85 % level significance 5 % group size . Ethics WE find participant risk minor inconvenience participate study . The study approve Ethics committee Copenhagen Frederiksberg Municipalities ( 01-257/04 ) . The study publish peer review biomedical journal</detailed_description>
