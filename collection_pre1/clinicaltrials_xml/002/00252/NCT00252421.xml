	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis `` thinning bone '' affect 1 4 Canadian woman 1 8 Canadian men . Moreover , rate osteoporosis among Canadians stabilize , worldwide number people afflict osteoporosis continue rise . The serious complication osteoporosis break bone fracture . Fractures due osteoporosis result long hospital stay , dependence others , premature death . While several medication prevent osteoporosis side effect . For example , postmenopausal woman take hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) increase risk breast cancer heart disease . In addition , drug prevent osteoporosis expensive available worldwide . Therefore , essential researcher continue identify test new medication prevention osteoporosis . The purpose research determine nitrate , group drug widely available , inexpensive , commonly use treat chest pain angina , prevent osteoporosis woman . If researcher find nitrates prevent osteoporosis , widely available , inexpensive treatment osteoporosis prevention long term side effect would identify . This improve health patient osteoporosis worldwide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Nitrate Bone Study : Effects Nitrates Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal consist two study . The objective first study determine isosorbide mononitrate ( ISMO ) 20 mg/day nitroglycerin ointment ( NTG ) 15 mg/day result few headache . The nitrate best tolerate used second study one main objective : To determine postmenopausal woman T-score lumbar spine ( L1 L4 ) 0 -2.0 randomize two year treatment intermittent nitrate great increase spine BMD compare woman randomize placebo . We hypothesize : 1 . Women report few headache randomize intermittent NTG ointment 15 mg/day compare intermittent oral ISMO 20 mg/day . 2 . After two year , woman randomize intermittent nitrate great percent increase lumbar spine BMD compare woman randomize placebo . To test hypothesis execute 2 trial include postmenopausal woman , age 50 old , BMD T score lumbar spine 0 -2.0 . We exclude subject prior osteoporotic fracture OP BMD testing , subject current metabolic bone cardiovascular disease , subject take treatment OP , subject migraine headache , subject know hypersensitivity nitrate . We use computer generate randomization allocate subject treatment assignment . To avoid bias study double-blind . The first study , use crossover design , recruit 22 subject randomly assign NTG ointment ISMO one week . In treatment two week wash period . Subjects rate headache daily basis use visual analog scale subject I calculate mean headache score 7 day treatment period treatment . We calculate mean headache score ( consider subject ) NTG mean headache score ISMO . We compare mean headache score treatment nitrate preparation best tolerate ( low mean score ) use second placebo control study ( main study ) whose primary objective ass effect intermittent nitrate spine BMD ( L1 L4 ) 280 postmenopausal woman . To limit differential drop due headache among subject randomize nitrate , main trial follow run-in phase subject receive nitrate one week . Only subject headache result discontinuation study medication nitrate run-in phase enter main study .</detailed_description>
