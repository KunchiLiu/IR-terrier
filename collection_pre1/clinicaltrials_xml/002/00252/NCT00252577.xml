	<brief_title>Genetic Predictors Lithium Response Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long term focus research program identification gene bipolar disorder . The investigator recently obtain evidence several line investigation support role gene G protein receptor Kinase 3 ( GRK3 ) bipolar disorder . Work replicate extend result continue NIH funding . In clinical investigator extend investigator ' work Pharmacogenetics attempt identify gene associate medication response bipolar disorder . Lithium first mood stabilizer medication remain mainstay treatment . Many patient excellent response lithium , tolerate well , stabilize year , others . The reason difference response unclear , likely genetic factor make substantial contribution . The lack good predictor response frequently result time consume trial error clinical process find best medication . Such trial error process take month prolongation patient suffering . Hence , strong clinical need predictor . The investigator conduct preliminary study 92 lithium responder 92 non-responders identify retrospective detailed history chart review . These subject genotyped 88 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) markers 9 candidate gene relevant lithium presume mechanism action bipolar disorder . Four SNP marker three gene show nominally significant association lithium response . One SNPs gene neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2 ( NTRK2 ) , receptor brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , show strong association patient predominantly euphoric opposed dysphoric mania ( p=0.0005 ) . Many data argue role BDNF mechanism antidepressant mood stabilized action well susceptibility bipolar disorder . No association observe dysphoric mania . This suggest variation gene may operate clinically genetically distinct subset patient . It also argue importance incorporate clinical subtypes analysis . These pilot result preliminary suggest feasibility approach . The investigator conduct prospective trial lithium monotherapy 100 patient bipolar disorder . 200 patient unstable , mildly moderately ill lithium screen entered 16-week stabilization phase treat switched lithium monotherapy . Patient stable lithium also enter mediation withdrawn . After stabilization patient follow one year mood episode require intervention . It expect 50 % patient stabilize therefore 100 patient enter maintenance phase . Time relapse pharmacological intervention primary outcome measure . This prospective sample use replicate previous result NTRK2 gene . Analyses conduct test difference survival curve different genotypic group . Genomic control method employ detect correct possible stratification heterogeneity . Clinical feature illness dysphoric mania , family history rapid cycle employed co-variates . Multivariate method also employ order attempt develop multi-gene predictor lithium response .</detailed_description>
