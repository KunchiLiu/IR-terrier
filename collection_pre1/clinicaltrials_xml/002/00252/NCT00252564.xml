	<detailed_description>This Phase III , open label , nonblinded study . A total 240 eligible patient randomize 1:1 basis either treatment Arm . In trial , compare efficacy , safety , tolerability novel combination biweekly infusional 5-FU/leucovorin plus cetuximab bevacizumab ( FOLF-CB ) current standard care , biweekly infusional 5-FU/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin bevacizumab ( Bev-FOLFOX ) . For practical purpose , study head head comparison oxaliplatin versus cetuximab , since component regimen .</detailed_description>
