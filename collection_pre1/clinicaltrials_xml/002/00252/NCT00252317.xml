	<brief_title>Acute Haemodynamic Effects Treatment With Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ( ACE ) -Inhibitors Patients With Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally vasodilator contraindicate patient aortic stenosis . Although control data exists believe hazardous reduce afterload , include treatment angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , patient aortic stenosis due risk increase transaortic gradient thus severe hypotension myocardial hypoperfusion . There grow evidence experimental clinical ACE inhibition could beneficial effect leave ventricular hypertrophy , diastolic function , acute , possibly chronic haemodynamic parameter patient aortic stenosis . There , however , lack clinical randomize trial could confirm finding . Aims Prospective double blind randomise study investigate safety effect treatment ACE-inhibitor patient severe aortic stenosis . Effects measure : - Invasive measure haemodynamic parameter ( Swann-Ganz ) - Working capacity - Diastolic systolic function ( measure tissue Doppler echocardiography ) - Blood pressure - B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) Patients 32 patient symptomatic aorta stenosis recruit Rigshospitalet department cardiology . Patients referred evaluation prior surgical intervention insertion valvular prosthesis screen . Additional 32 patient asymptomatic aorta stenosis recruit Rigshospitalet cardiology department . Methods Recruitment Patients symptomatic severe aortic stenosis schedule aortic valve replacement The Heart Centre Rigshospitalets department cardiology recruit . Patients severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis Rigshospitalet recruit . If necessary , patient hospital recruit . Randomisation After baseline screening , patient randomize active treatment placebo . Half patient ACE-inhibitors ( Captopril-test dose Trandolapril ) half placebo . Administration medicine ACE-inhibitor/placebo administration double blind perform hospital pharmacist involve part project . All patient hospitalise intensive care unit first 3 day evaluate acute haemodynamic change start treatment . If patient symptoms 3 day discharge treatment 8 week . Visits plan 2 8 week .</detailed_description>
