	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine sleep disorder breathing veteran Gulf War Syndrome ( GWS ) compare healthy normal asymptomatic Gulf War veteran . This study also determine effect treatment continuous positive airway pressure veteran Gulf War Syndrome . 1 . The investigator hypothesize sleep complaint ( insomnia , un-refreshing sleep daytime fatigue ) among GWS patient related increase sleep fragmentation secondary presence sleep disorder breathe GWS patient . 2 . The investigator hypothesize increased collapsibility upper airway sleep development inspiratory flow limitation ( IFL ) sleep disorder breathing cause increase sleep fragmentation GWS patient . 3 . The investigator hypothesize correction IFL sleep disorder breathe GWS patient result improvement sleep quality result improvement sleep complaint functional symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis 1 : To demonstrate compare Gulf War Veterans without GWS , GWS patient decrease total sleep increase sleep fragmentation due presence sleep disorder breathing In order accomplish goal subsequent goal , assemble two sample Gulf War veteran . The first sample male GWS patient second sample male Gulf War veteran without GWS ( Gulf War veteran control group ) . All GWS patient register Gulf War Veterans Registry . To avoid referral bias favor presence IFL sleep sleep disorder breathing , enroll GWS patient contact Registry invite participate . Gulf War veteran control recruit way advertisement . Prospective study participant screen several self-report instrument determine eligibility assignment GWS group Gulf War veteran control group . Criteria assignment GWS group score designate clinical cutpoint three instrument measure , fatigue , pain cognitive dysfunction . 1 . Fatigue precede week assess use fatigue severity scale , 10-item instrument measure level disability relate fatigue ( increase disability rat 1-7 ) . 2 . Pain precede week assess use pain visual analog scale ( VAS ; increase pain rat 0-10 ) . 3 . Cognitive dysfunction precede week , increase difficulty memory , ability think , ability concentrate assess VAS ( increase cognitive dysfunction rat 0-10 ) . Conversely , criterion assignment GW Veteran control group require score non-clinical range instrument . Every subject full night polysomnogram . Hypothesis 2 : To demonstrate presence IFL sleep disorder breathing sleep among GWS patient distinguishes Gulf War veteran without GWS A second sleep study use accomplish second objective . Using precise method , quantify prevalence IFL sleep GWS patient Gulf War veteran control . Following completion , study stag use Rechtschaffen Kales criterion . From study , 3 three minute period continuous NREM sleep ( total approximately 120 breath ) randomly select analyzed prevalence flow limit breath . During three minute period , breath analyze whether occur sleep brief ( &lt; 15 second ) arousal . Hypothesis 3 : To demonstrate relief IFL sleep sleep disorder breathe result improvement functional symptom GWS patient We accomplish utilize mask parallel group sham-control treatment trial nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) GWS patient . Functional symptom ( fatigue , pain cognitive dysfunction ) assess use validate , self-report questionnaire daily rating symptom .</detailed_description>
