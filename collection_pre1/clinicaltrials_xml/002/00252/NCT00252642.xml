	<brief_title>Peginterferon Alpha-2a Maintenance Therapy Portal Hypertension Patients With Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Portal hypertension develop patient advanced fibrosis cirrhosis primary drive force lead complication cirrhosis , hepatic decompensation mortality patient chronic liver disease . None three major complication advance liver disease variceal hemorrhage , ascites hepatic encephalopathy occur absence portal hypertension . As result , measure portal pressure treat portal hypertension important part management patient advance liver disease . A sub-study measure portal pressure initially propose part HALT-C clinical trial . Unfortunately , 2/10 center elect participate sub-study result , eventually drop sub-study within HALT-C trial . Recent data suggest interferon therapy may selectively reduce portal hypertension patient cirrhosis . In abstract present 2004 annual meet European Association Study Liver ( EASL ) , portal pressure decline significantly patient NR 6 month treatment peginterferon ribavirin . At time portal pressure measure study , transjugular liver biopsy also perform assess effect treatment hepatic histology . Despite reduction portal pressure , reduction hepatic fibrosis score observe . This suggest interferon may reduce portal pressure direct affect hepatic vasculature ; suggest interferon may prevent complication cirrhosis regardless effect HCV RNA hepatic inflammation . Since portal pressure primary factor responsible complication cirrhosis include variceal hemorrhage , ascites hepatic encephalopathy , preliminary result suggest maintenance interferon therapy could possibly prevent complication . Preliminary result form randomize , control trial maintenance interferon therapy ( Co-Pilot ) present 2004 annual meet American Association study Liver Disease ( AASLD ) fact demonstrate patient advance fibrosis cirrhosis receive maintenance peginterferon maintenance therapy two year period significant reduction incidence variceal hemorrhage compare observe control group . The HALT-C trial provide ideal patient population ass effect maintenance interferon therapy portal hypertension . The first patient enrol HALT-C trial schedule complete four year maintenance therapy near end 2004 . This provide optimal time point assess impact maintenance interferon therapy portal pressure . Although ideal study design would measure portal pressure baseline 4 year control treatment group , measure portal pressure completion study still provide significant information regard impact maintenance interferon therapy portal hypertension . The number patient enrol HALT-C two site substantial ( nearly 400 patient ) since control maintenance therapy group well match start study assume baseline portal pressure time randomization significantly different two group . Thus , 4 year maintenance interferon therapy indeed reduce portal pressure significant difference mean portal pressure observe two group completion HALT-C trial . Patients randomize control arm HALT-C past four year receive treatment chronic HCV past 4 year . Such patient offer opportunity receive peginterferon maintenance therapy 6 month part protocol undergo repeat measurement portal pressure determine could potentially benefit remain peginterferon maintenance therapy long term</detailed_description>
