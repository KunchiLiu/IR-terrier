	<detailed_description>1 . Objective project : Interferon-a ( IFN ) -induced depression common complication use treat patient hepatitis C ( HCV ) , report 44 % patient experience depressive side effect . The central hypothesis propose research polymorphism specific serotonergic gene associate propensity develop IFN-induced depression . Further , IFN-induced decrease tryptophan serotonin level putatively relate emergence depressive symptom IFN therapy . The objective proposal identify predictor IFN-induced depression depressive side effect well manage treated thus permit patient complete full course IFN therapy . 2 . Research plan : We plan test hypothesis accomplish objective application pursue follow two specific objective : 1. evaluate role genetic locus may contribute vulnerability IFN use association analysis . Vulnerability operationalized maximal Beck Depression Inventory-II ( BDI-II ) score , co-varying pre-treatment BDI-II score , 2. identify effect time course antiviral therapy potential biomarkers IFN-induced depression , include tryptophan , 5-HT , cortisol level . Changes biochemical level compare depressive symptomology genetic vulnerability . 3 . Methodology : Patients ask participate prospective study monitor course IFN therapy symptom depression biochemical change measure blood . 120 HCV patient initiate IFN therapy recruit ( 3/month 40 month ) Portland VA Long Beach VA Medical Centers . Following baseline assessment , subject follow every 2 week period 4 month . The development major depression , depressive symptom , related IFN-induced side effect monitor use rating scale . For genetic biochemical measure , blood sample collect prior IFN therapy . Patients test certain genetic polymorphism . Analyses . Using linear regression , genotype independent variable , co-varying baseline BDI-II score , maximal BDI-II score examine dependent variable . An ANOVA repeat measure perform determine effect IFN therapy tryptophan , 5-HT , cortisol level . In addition , relationship interferon induce MDD certain polymorphism examine . 4 . Findings , result conclusion reach date : In preliminary study find 33 % HCV patient IFN therapy develop major depressive disorder course treatment . In addition , preliminary pilot result suggest 5-HT transporter polymorphism short allele `` C '' allele tryptophan hydroxylase polymorphism may increase vulnerability IFN-induced depression . 5 . Clinical relevance : There currently know , reliable predictor IFN-induced depression . The chronic disease HCV infection collectively affect approximately 4 million Americans 200 million people worldwide . IFN clinically approve medication whose long-term use reduce risk fatal outcome even curative individual . However , side effect associate IFN therapy represent major obstacle adequate treatment patient HCV , often result discontinuation IFN therapy .</detailed_description>
