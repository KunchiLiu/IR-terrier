	<detailed_description>Most survey emergency physician indicate smoke cessation counsel rarely occur routine clinical practice .

We conduct similar survey study find 19 % emergency physician practice urban teaching hospital report routinely counsel tobacco use patient quit . A study 63 adult smoker present ED symptom acute respiratory illness find 9 % offer assistance quit ( Bock et al. , 2001 ) . Clearly , research need investigate smoking intervention initiate ED . Currently , much know best intervene smoker ED . This proposal describe pilot study design explore two intervention . Research expand knowledge ED-initiated tobacco intervention tremendous public health potential , especially under-served population over-represented ED patient population.This study design primarily yield effect size parameter large RCT plan . For reason , power specifically detect give difference , , rather , simply provide idea size effect determine many subject would need future trial order demonstrate statistical significance clinical utility . It also use refine study design , protocol , treatment manual future trial . This study randomize , single-blind , control trial compare two type ED-initiated tobacco treatment treatment-as-usual . 75 ED patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion randomly assign one three group use 2:2:1 ratio : Group One : Enhanced Care ( n=30 ) , Group Two : Dynamic Referral ( n=30 ) , Group Three : Clinic Referral ( n=15 ) . This assignment ratio use maximize experience treatment . The two intervention deliver trained counselor describe . Baseline measure smoke relate variable take ED visit . An interviewer blind study group assignment conduct follow-up assessment via telephone 1- 3-months ED visit . We expect 25 % attrition , yield follow-up data 3-months 23 , 23 , 11 patient , respectively , Group . Primary outcome include : sustained abstinence ED visit follow-up time period 7-day point prevalence abstinence . Secondary outcome : presence quit attempt &gt; = 24 hour readiness change .</detailed_description>
