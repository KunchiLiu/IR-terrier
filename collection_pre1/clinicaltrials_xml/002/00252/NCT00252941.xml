	<brief_title>Prophylactic Urethral Stenting With Memokath After Prostate Implantation Prostate Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Image-guided transperineal permanent prostate brachytherapy ( PI ) accept curative treatment option patient early stage prostate cancer . Multiple report define efficacy show superior antecedent trans-abdominal technique . In addition , efficacy PI show similar radical retropubic prostatectomy ( RRP ) external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) . These positive result , however , gain expense toxicity . The notable toxicity associate urinary system . The severe side effect PI urinary retention require intermittent self-catheterization ( ISC ) . The reported rate severe urinary retention follow PI ~10 % . Most patient manage ISC alpha-blocker week . Although generally temporary phenomenon , small percentage eventually require surgical intervention permit urinary flow . This major concern patient undergo PI , reason avoid form curative treatment . The use implantable stent successful BPH . The Memokath速 device show decrease International Prostate Symptom Score mean 20.3 8.2 first 3 month stent placement patient bladder outlet obstruction unable undergo TURP . Few experience side-effects pain 3 % , hematuria 3 % , incontinence 6 % , infection 6 % . A multicenter randomize control trial currently underway assess use device patient recurrent urethral stricture . Urethral stent use success patient post-brachytherapy bladder outlet obstruction . Five patient , could tolerate alpha-blocker clean intermittent catheterization , receive UroLume urethral stent follow one episodes urinary retention . All patient able void immediately stent placement . No patient develop incontinence stent placement . The main complaint follow UroLume速 stent placement urethral bleeding , refer pain head penis , dysuria . These symptom require stent removal 2 5 patient . In another study , five patient receive SpannerTM urethral stent follow significant urinary symptom prostate brachytherapy . All patient able void spontaneously post-void residual volume urine . Flow rate increase International Prostate Symptom Score decrease mean 25.2 10 ( p=0.03 ) . However , two patient experience pain , require removal stent . Given patient experienced side effect Memokath速 urethral stent bladder outlet obstruction , wish ass toxicity associate stent post-brachytherapy setting . In addition , would like ass efficacy use prophylactically reduce bladder outlet obstruction follow prostate brachytherapy impact AUA score .</detailed_description>
