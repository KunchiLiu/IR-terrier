	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine 3 different dos tenecteplase ( TNK ) well treat stroke patient TNK offer advantage currently available treatment tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Tenecteplase ( TNK ) Acute Ischemic Stroke ( TNK-S2B )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke third lead cause death lead cause adult disability United States worldwide . To date , scientifically-proven FDA-approved treatment acute stroke clot-busting drug , tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) . A new clot-busting drug , tenecteplase ( TNK ) , chemical property make potentially safer effective drug treat stroke . Preliminary test TNK patient acute stroke encouraging enough warrant test . This study , TNK-S2B , compare three different dos TNK standard tPA treatment patient acute stroke . Patients choose randomly receive either TNK tPA . Neither patient his/her doctor know medication patient receive study completely finish . The first part study look result treatment first 24 hour select best dose TNK carry forward detail comparison standard tPA treatment . After least 100-150 pair best dose TNK tPA patient enrol , entry study pause , outcomes 3 month stroke compare see result TNK treatment sufficiently promise improvement standard treatment justify expand study find definitive answer . The study , conduct least 8 large medical center , expect last 3 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients least serious , measurable deficit NIH Stroke Scale language ( aphasia score &gt; 1 ) , motor power ( arm leg &gt; 1 ) , vision ( best visual score &gt; 2 ) , attention ( attention score &gt; 2 ) . Thus eligible patient may minimum total score 1 deficit language motor power . There maximum score exclusionary ; even patient severe hemispheric brainstem deficit eligible , current practice intravenous rtPA . Patients ischemic stroke type vascular distribution eligible . Must arrive participate hospital treatment begin within 3 hour onset symptom . Patients awaken new symptom must use time last observed normal awake total time exceed three hour prior treatment time onset . Must 18 year age old . Patients ) minor stroke symptom ( e.g. , sensory loss , ataxia , dysarthria , facial weakness alone ) b ) major symptom rapidly improve time treatment . Patients complete NIH Stroke Score obtain ( e.g. , intubated patient complete amputee ) . Patients evidence intracranial hemorrhage pretreatment CT scan . Patients clinical presentation suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage , even initial CT scan normal . Patients know suspected pregnant . Patients know bleeding diathesis patient platelet count &lt; 100,000 . For patient take oral Warfarin ( Coumadin ) , result pretreatment International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) must available prior treatment must &lt; /= 1.4 . Patients receive heparin within 48 hour must normal partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) eligible . Patients receive low molecular weight heparin heparinoid within 24 hour also exclude . Patients major surgery serious trauma exclude head trauma within 14 day serious head trauma within 3 month . Patients history gastrointestinal urinary tract hemorrhage previous 21 day . Patients arterial puncture noncompressible site lumbar puncture previous 7 day . Patients , repeat measurement , systolic blood pressure &gt; 185 , diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg treatment begin , require aggressive treatment reduce blood pressure within limit . Patients history stroke previous 3 month ever intracranial hemorrhage consider put increase risk intracranial hemorrhage . Patients serious medical illness likely interfere treatment treatment might adversely affect illness . Patients abnormal blood glucose think account neurological deficit . Patients clinical presentation consistent acute myocardial infarction patient presentation suggest postmyocardial infarction pericarditis . Patients seizure onset stroke think present postictal paralysis mimic stroke . Patients preexist neurological psychiatric disease would confound neurological functional evaluation . Patients receive investigational drug within 14 day . Patients large area ( great one lobe ) obvious low density baseline CT scan presume ongoing cerebral ischemia great 3 hour , , therefore , exclude . Patients subtle early sign cerebral infarction ( e.g. , sulcal effacement , blur greywhite junction , asymmetry basal ganglion , insular ribbon sign , others ) dense artery sign baseline CT scan eligible . Similarly , evidence previous remote cerebral infarction baseline CT exclusionary . Patients informed consent obtain .</criteria>
