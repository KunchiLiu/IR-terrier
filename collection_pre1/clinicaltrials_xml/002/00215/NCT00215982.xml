	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effective new combination drug Capecitabine ( Xeloda ) , Oxaliplatin ( Eloxatin ) , Irinotecan ( Camptosar ) colon rectal cancer . All three drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment colon rectal cancer . This however first time three drug combine schedule treatment colon/rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Capecitabine With Irinotecan Oxaliplatin ( Eloxatin ) Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine radiographic response rate patient metastatic colorectal cancer treat Oxaliplatin , Capecitabine Irinotecan . Secondary objective determine time tumor progression toxicity tolerability Oxaliplatin , Capecitabine Irinotecan administer combination . Study schema follow . Cycles 42 day long . Patients receive Oxaliplatin Capecitabine day 1 . Capecitabine oral pill take 14 day . Patients return day 21 receive Irinotecan Capecitabine . Capecitabine take 14 day . CT scan performed end 6 week cycle determine response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histological cytological confirm metastatic colorectal cancer . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . No prior chemotherapy metastatic setting ( prior fluorouracil chemotherapy , administer adjuvant setting , 6 month pass since completion therapy , allowable ) . Prior adjuvant radiation therapy allowable provide great 30 % total bone marrow include field ( must 6 week since completion radiation therapy . Subject must 18 year old Life expectancy great 12 week . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL ; absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL ; Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL ; total bilirubin within normal institutional limit ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ; Creatinine within normal institutional limit Creatinine clearance ( estimate CockcroftGault equation ) &gt; 50mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Has negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior initiation therapy ( female patient childbearing potential ) . Woman childbearing potential either positive pregnancy test baseline . ( Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential ) . Patients agree continue contraception 30 day date last study drug administration Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Prior therapy MCRC metastatic setting . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Grade 2 great peripheral neuropathy . Prior unanticipated severe reaction fluoropyrimidine therapy , know sensitivity 5fluorouracil . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , symptomatic coronary artery disease cardiac arrhythmia well controlled medication ) myocardial infarction within last 12 month . Pregnant nursing woman exclude study . Women / men childbearing potential use reliable appropriate contraceptive method . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction Oxaliplatin Irinotecan agent administer study . Major surgery within 4 week start study treatment , without complete recovery . Lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract malabsorption syndrome . History clinically significant interstitial lung disease and/or pulmonary fibrosis . History persistent neurosensory disorder include limited peripheral neuropathy Treatment carcinoma within last five year , except cure nonmelanoma skin treat insitu cervical cancer . Participation investigational drug study within 4 week precede start study treatment . Any prior platinum base therapy</criteria>
