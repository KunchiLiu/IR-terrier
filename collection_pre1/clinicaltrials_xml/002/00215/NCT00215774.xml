	<detailed_description>Details trial describe design paper publish American Heart Journal ( 1 ) . Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common sustain cardiac arrhythmia approximately one million affected patient Germany . Current estimate suggest life-time risk AF 30 % men slightly less woman age 40 year . Due demographic change German population , incidence prevalence AF expect double within next 30 year . AF almost double mortality cause important morbidity , mainly due thrombo-embolic complication stroke . In addition , arrhythmia reduces chronotropic adaptation heart increase work load reduces cardiac output , especially patient heart failure cardiac disease . Restoration sinus rhythm would reduce burden disease . Acute termination AF almost always successful external electrical cardioversion , especially use recently optimize technique [ biphasic shock wave form , anterior-posterior electrode position , sinter steel electrode paddle . Maintaining sinus rhythm , however , difficult task . Antiarrhythmic , ion channel-blocking drug effective prevent part recurrent episodes AF . Their long-term use , however , limited pro-arrhythmic side effect especially apparent long-term therapy . AF initiate major change atrial electrophysiology per se summarize `` electrical remodeling '' . The main consequence change shorten atrial refractory period action potential duration . Electrical remodel maintains AF relate recurrence AF successful cardioversion . Electrical remodel reversed sinus rhythm maintain approximately 4 week successful cardioversion . Interestingly , vast majority AF recurrence occur first week cardioversion . Conceptually , initial phase `` reversal '' electrical remodel separated long-term treatment aim modify underlie substrate AF . Classical sodium- potassium channel block antiarrhythmic drug prolong atrial action potential even fibrillate atrium may therefore support even anticipate reversal electrical remodel . Such pharmacological reversal electrical remodeling may transiently require , i.e . electrical remodel reversed natural restoration normal atrial electrophysiology . Atrial action potential prolongation beyond normal value may indeed even pro-arrhythmic . Therefore , tempt treat main electrophysiological end point electrical remodeling , shorten atrial action potential duration , limited short-term use action potential-prolonging antiarrhythmic drug . Hypothesis : Targeted `` pharmacological reversal '' atrial remodel short-term administration action potential prolonging antiarrhythmic drug ( 4 week therapy duration ) equally efficient potentially safer prevent recurrent AF cardioversion compare current long-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy . Trial design : This prospective , randomize , control , open label , parallel group multi-center investigator-initiated trial . The study medication prescribe open fashion . We choose open design order increase external validity ( `` relevance clinical practice '' ) result . After successful cardioversion , patient randomize one three treatment group : Group A : No antiarrhythmic treatment Group B : 4 week antiarrhythmic treatment flecainide Group C : Standard long term antiarrhythmic treatment ( 6 month ) flecainide Group size calculate allow demonstration non-inferiority two active treatment arm 10 % boundary . Flecainide chosen antiarrhythmic treatment Flec-SL trial effective prevention recurrent AF cardioversion absence major structural heart disease , safe outpatient treatment recurrent AF , prolong atrial action potential patient AF . In addition action potential-prolonging effect , flecainide induces post-repolarization refractoriness atrium , electrophysiological effect may assist prevention recurrent AF . This investigator-initiated trial . Sponsor AFNET ( www.kompetenznetz-vorhofflimmern.de ) . Primary end point time persistent AF assess daily telemetric ECG recording confirm conventional Holter ECG recording . Secondary end point include burden AF , time first symptomatic episode AF , AF burden ( number duration AF episode ) , number hospitalization due AF , time termination trial medication , number serious adverse event include pro-arrhythmic event , quality life . Details secondary end point indicate approved trial protocol . All patient systematically follow 6 month daily telemetric ECG recording . All recording obtain use miniaturize ECG recorder allow record 60-second ECG transtelephonic ECG transmission ECG via toll-free number . All ECGs receive central analysis unit locate Institute Clinical Cardiovascular Research ( IKKF ) Munich . Each telemetric ECG analyze within 24 hour receipt analysis unit . The study physician inform case abnormal result within 24 hour . Suspicion persistent atrial fibrillation Tele-ECG prompt local visit record Holte ECG . The Holter ECGs centrally analyze ( blinded end point analysis ) . The systematic telemetric ECG monitoring allow detection episode recurrent persistent AF .</detailed_description>
