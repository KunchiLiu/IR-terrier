	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial find safety effectiveness well patient â€™ quality life combination Taxotere celecoxib patient hormone refractory prostate cancer . Celecoxib ( Celebrex ) FDA approve drug treat arthritis . Taxotere ( Docetaxel ) FDA approve chemotherapy drug treat certain form cancer . Both drug demonstrate evidence tumor blood vessel suppression combination two drug could possibly arrest tumor growth make tumor decrease size .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Combination Therapy With Celecoxib Taxotere Treatment Stage D3 Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard hormone therapy patient metastases androgen deprivation . This treatment lead response 75-80 % patient , median duration response 14-18 month . Once patient becomes hormone resistant , effective therapy prolong life . For patient HRPC , median life expectancy 17 months.2 Thus palliative care remain standard therapy HRPC . The widely use chemotherapy regimens combination mitoxantrone prednisone taxanes estramustine phosphate.3,4,5 Taxotere also demonstrate activity prostate cancer cell lines.6 Several clinical study demonstrate activity patient metastatic prostate cancer single agent combination.4 , 5 Taxotere may exert effect part anti-angiogenic effects.7 Recent work animal model provide additional evidence beneficial role angiostatic agent treatment malignant disease . This first study two drug use together prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
