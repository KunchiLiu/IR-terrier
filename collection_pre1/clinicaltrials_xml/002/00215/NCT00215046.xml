	<brief_summary>To evaluate efficacy chemotherapeutic agent vinblastine methotrexate treatment two group child multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis . Group 1 contain child multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis structural heart disease , Group 2 consist child multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis concomitant structural heart disease . The primary outcome variable efficacy patient status one year start treatment , status classify either failure success . Failure define death evidence progressive obstruction time course treatment define protocol . Success constitute complete partial response treatment stability disease . Secondary outcome variable efficacy survival , time diagnosis pulmonary vein stenosis failure , change patient classification scale measure severity obstructive disease . 1.2 To assess safety vinblastine methotrexate treatment multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis . The primary outcome variable safety occurrence toxicity relate administration chemotherapeutic agent treatment period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We seek develop regimen might successfully suppress myofibroblastic proliferation infant child progressive pulmonary vein stenosis . A number factor need consider propose novel treatment option patient multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis . Specifically : - Treatment direct specific target , case excessive proliferation myofibroblasts . - Treatment know activity target cell . - Treatment well-tolerated patient group . In case , agent minimal hemodynamic side effect would prefer . - Treatment preclude patient participation potentially effective therapy . Specifically , agent cause significant myelosuppression would allow list transplantation . - Treatment interfere normal growth development , minimal risk long-term toxicity second tumor . After consider factor , choose administer two chemotherapeutic agent , vinblastine methotrexate . Vinblastine methotrexate 30 year usage well-tolerated . The agent use give low-dose usually cause nausea vomiting , cause significant immunosuppression , present , could lead risk infection fever . Desmoid tumor , also refer infantile fibromatosis , overlap infantile myofibromatosis . A combination standard agent successfully use treat desmoid tumor infant vinblastine methotrexate ( 24 ) . As opposed cyclophosphamide-based regimen , combination distinct advantage acute side effect know long-term toxicity , infertility second malignancy . These agent use 30 year treat infant childhood malignancy . Over last five year , methotrexate vinblastine use treat 9 child recurrent desmoid tumor , lesion similar although identical abnormality present patient pulmonary vein stenosis . This regimen minimal acute toxicity limit mild moderate nausea ( easily control anti-emetic therapy ) , minimal alopecia , mild hepatic inflammation , mild myelosuppression . An addition advantage drug interfere list lung transplantation , important factor overall treatment option patient population . Instead high-dose administration chemotherapy ( catch cell cycle time administration ) , low-dose chronic weekly administration continue catch proliferate cell continually come cycle . This may explain trial chemotherapy ( high-dose cytoxan ) unsuccessful . Of 9 child desmoid lesion receive vinblastine methotrexate therapy , four patient treat 18 month longer . At time last report , patient progressive disease therapy . Two child radiographically stable disease 1 2 year treatment . Two child stable disease 1 2 year treatment disease progression . Thus , drug combination well-tolerated , minimal side effect , demonstrate clinical activity closely related type lesion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis base clinical radiographic ground time biopsy prior surgical procedure . The diagnosis must consistent multivessel pulmonary stenosis . There must evidence severe pulmonary vein stenosis least two pulmonary vein . Evidence myofibroblast neoproliferation , biopsy obtain . Staging must include complete cardiovascular evaluation include echocardiogram , EKG . Accepted organ function include : Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x normal age . SGPT , Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x normal age . ANC ³ 1,500/mm3 , Hemoglobin ³ 10g/dl , Platelets ³ 100,000/mm3 Placement permanent central venous line . CVL access necessary patient vinblastine vesicant cause tissue burn infiltrate skin . Because CVL may interfere proper cardiac assessment patient population , study physician make aware prior placement line . Patients may list lung transplant enrol study . All patient must give write informed consent accord institutional guideline .</criteria>
