	<brief_summary>HRN-003 STUDY SYNOPSIS OBJECTIVE : To compare Sustained Virologic Response ( SVR ) PEGIntron plus ribavirin among patient receive fix dose PEGIntron versus weighted-adjusted dosing . OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN : This multi-center , randomize , open-label clinical trial use PEGIntron weight-adjusted dose subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin mouth twice daily 48 week OR PEGIntron fix dose subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin mouth twice daily 48 week . STUDY POPULATION : 600 Adult patient chronic hepatitis C virus infection previously fail achieve sustain virologic response follow interferon alfa interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin therapy . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Eligible participant randomize receive PEGIntron weight-adjusted dose ( 1.5 mg/kg ) subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg mouth twice daily 48 week OR PEGIntron fix dose ( 150 mg weight &gt; 80 kg 100 mg weight &lt; 80 KG ) subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg mouth twice daily 48 week . EFFICACY EVALUATIONS : Laboratory analysis , quality life assessment , change study medication dos obtain . SAFETY EVALUATIONS : Assessment laboratory evaluation , vital sign , incidence severity adverse experience progression disease , measure HCV viral load . STUDY DESIGN This treatment protocol evaluate antiviral efficacy , safety tolerability polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) conjugate interferon alfa-2b ( PEGIntron ) treatment chronic hepatitis C virus infection patient previously fail achieve sustain virologic response follow interferon alfa interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin therapy . Patients stratify accord response previous course therapy ( i.e . non-reponse relapse virologic pattern This multi-center , randomize , open-label clinical trial involve approximately 25 site anticipate enrollment 600 patient six-month period . Eligible participant randomize receive PEGIntron weight-adjusted dose ( 1.5 mg/kg ) subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg mouth twice daily 48 week OR PEGIntron fix dose ( 150 mg weight &gt; 80 kg 100 mg weight &lt; 80 KG ) subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg mouth twice daily 48 week . - Group A : PEGIntron weight -adjusted dose ( 1.5 mg/kg ) subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg mouth twice daily 48 week ( Total therapy x 48weeks ) . - Group B : PEGIntron fix dose ( 150 mg weight &gt; 80 kg 100 mg weight &lt; 80 KG ) subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg mouth twice daily additional 48 week ( Total therapy x 48 week ) .</brief_summary>
