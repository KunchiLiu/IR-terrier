	<brief_title>Cisplatin Irinotecan Chemotherapy , Followed ZD 1839 ( Iressa ) Patients With Esophageal Gastric Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized , multicenter Phase II study design evaluate tumor response rate patient surgically unresectable and/or metastatic esophageal , esophagogastric , gastric adenocarcinoma squamous carcinoma . Study schema follow . Patients receive Irinotecan Cisplatin day 1 8 every 21 day maximum 6 cycle therapy . This follow ZD 1839 ( Iressa ) , oral pill take daily . During Iressa phase , patient evaluate every 6 week . This include lab , CT scan physical examination . The exploratory objective study examine correlation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression radiographic response treatment .</detailed_description>
