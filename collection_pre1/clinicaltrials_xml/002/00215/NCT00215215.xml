	<brief_title>Effectiveness Study Comparing Treatment With Drug ( ) Adjunctive VNS Therapy Pharmacoresistant Partial Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Published data suggest patient continue experience seizure trial two three AEDs unlikely become seizure-free attempt pharmacotherapy . Such patient may experience poor quality life functional outcome continue seizure adverse effect associate attempt pharmacotherapy . VNS non-pharmacologic treatment epilepsy well-established effectiveness adjunctive treatment ( AEDs ) partial seizure refractory AEDs , randomize clinical trial compare effectiveness adjunctive VNS therapy pharmacotherapy alone patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient diagnosis partial seizure onset age 50 , patient ’ prior electroencephalography magnetic resonance image study consistent diagnosis partial seizure . Patient least 4 complex partial seizure , less 25 seizure ( type ) , per month 3 month precede randomization ; 8 week precede randomization , seizure frequency confirm patient diary . Patient adequate response adequate dosage intolerant minimum 2 different AEDs . Patient ( investigator ’ judgment ) sufficient impairment his/her epilepsy and/or epilepsy treatment potential benefits/risks VNS therapy warrant . Patient must currently receive least one AED , three AEDs , stable dosage regimen least one month randomization . Patient must 12 year age old . Patient must able provide reliable seizure count complete evaluation specify study procedure flow chart . Patient must provide write informed consent , legal guardian must give write permission minor provide write assent . Patient history ( lifetime ) receive 5 different AEDs . Patient bilateral leave cervical vagotomy . Patient currently use , expect use study , shortwave diathermy , microwave diathermy , therapeutic ultrasound diathermy . A VNS Therapy System implant would ( investigator ’ judgment ) pose unacceptable surgical medical risk patient . Patient expect require full body magnetic resonance image clinical study . Patient previous VNS Therapy System implant . Patient previous neuroimaging study demonstrate mesial temporal sclerosis , cortical dysplasia , suspect brain tumor .</criteria>
