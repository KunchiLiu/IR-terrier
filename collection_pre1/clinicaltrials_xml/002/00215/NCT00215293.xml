	<brief_title>Cervical I/F Cage Anterior Cervical Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomize multi-center clinical trial ass safety efficacy investigational device , Cervical I/F Cage fusion one two adjacent level cervical spine . Patients randomly assign ration 1:1 investigational control group . Comparison : The device compare control group consist 3 accepted standard care treatment ( autograft , autograft anterior plate , allograft anterior plate ) . For two level fusion , control group limit autograft plate allograft plate . Based current literature , believe difference three treatment term clinical success , fusion success , safety issue . However , amongst investigator prefer treatment . Each investigator choose one control treatments study initiation . Patients randomize 1:1 Cage : control randomization schema . Approximately 240 subject enrol 20 site . Eligible patient symptomatic degeneration one two adjacent cervical disc , fail six week non-surgical treatment , sufficiently severe enough symptom warrant surgery , prior fusion surgery cervical spine .</detailed_description>
