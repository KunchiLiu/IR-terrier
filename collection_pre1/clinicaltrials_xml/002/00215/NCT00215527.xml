	<brief_summary>The investigator study use enzyme replacement therapy spinal fluid treatment spinal cord compression Hurler-Scheie Scheie form mucopolysaccharidosis I ( MPS I ) . Funding source -- FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrathecal Enzyme Replacement Therapy Spinal Cord Compression Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) develop mucopolysaccharidosis I ( MPS I ) , lysosomal storage disorder . ERT help many physical ailment due disease , treat central nervous system , due inability cross blood brain barrier . Our purpose test delivery ERT spinal fluid via intrathecal injection patient MPS I . In pilot study , use recombinant human Î±-L-iduronidase administer intrathecally per month four month individual Hurler-Scheie Scheie form MPS I spinal cord compression . If successful , intrathecal delivery could represent practical , straightforward method treat central nervous system disease due lysosomal storage .</detailed_description>
