	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine whether treatment experimental gene therapy ( BIOBYPASS® ) reduce angina study participant stimulate growth new blood vessel . This measure test whether participant able exercise longer without experience angina treatment , compare treatment . Additionally , study collect information side effect might relate treatment experimental therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Angina Pectoris</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Age great equal 18 year less equal 80 year ; Written inform consent obtain prior study dictated procedure ; Moderate severe angina ( CCS Angina Class IIIV ) despite optimal medical therapy ; Treated optimal unchanged antianginal medical therapy least 2 month prior first baseline ETT . Optimal medical therapy must include follow medication ( unless hemodynamic parameter intolerance contraindicate use ) : Nitroglycerine ; Antianginal medication : Longacting nitrate , calciumchannel blocker , potassium channel opener betablockers ( Note : All participant require least 2 4 antianginal medication list ) ; Platelet aggregation inhibitor ( e.g. , aspirin , ticlopidine , clopidogrel ) ACE inhibitor Statin ( HMGCoA Reductase Inhibitor ) The participant must , within 3 month prior randomization , document coronary angiographic evidence significant 2 3 vessel disease , equivalent disease one dominant artery , least one remain large coronary vessel new collaterals/vessels could supply . Any participant undergone CABG PCI within 6 month entry must angiography perform within 1 month prior entry , least 4 month previous intervention rule early restenosis . Candidates must eligible revascularization procedure . The participant coronary film must discuss independent cardiac surgeon must deny CABG PTCA . Participants marginal poor candidate conventional revascularization consider eligible risk perform CABG PTCA procedure outweigh potential benefit and/or procedure unlikely offer worthwhile clinical benefit . The criterion define case may include , may limit , follow example : Diffuse distal vessel disease Chronic occlusion Unprotected leave main stenosis Tortuous severely angulate vessel Severely calcify vessel Small vessel ( &lt; 2.5mm ) Two baseline bicycle ergometry exercise tolerance test ( ETTs ) perform meet follow criterion : Able exercise minimum duration 2 minute 8 minute Exercise duration two ETTs must within 15 % . ( The second test use baseline value . In event excessive variability , third test may perform participant may enrol exercise duration third test within 15 % either prior test . In case , third test use baseline value . ) ETTs must discontinue reason ETT Angina Level 3 Note : Participant must NOT inform exercise restriction require entry . Significant reversible myocardial ischemia single photon emission computer tomography ( SPECT ) . Judgment make independent core lab . The size reversible defect must &gt; 10 % leave ventricle . Ventricular wall thickness treatment zone &gt; 8mm per baseline echocardiogram . Pregnant lactating woman . It require men woman use condom another barrier method birth control least 8 week follow administration BIOBYPASS® form birth control least one year ; Clinically significant anemia ( e.g . hematocrit &lt; 36 % hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dL men &lt; 11 g/dL woman ) , leukopenia ( WBC &lt; 3,000/µL ) , leukocytosis ( WBC &gt; 12,000 ) , thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 100,000 billion/l ) ; Abnormal prothrombin partial thromboplastin time anticoagulant therapy withheld treatment ; Significant renal dysfunction ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL ) ; Hepatic dysfunction ( AST/ALT must within normal limit ) ; Hematuria , unless know , nonmalignant etiology ( unexplained hematuria would require candidate exclude ) ; Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 200 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg ) significant hypotension ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg ) ; Conditions angina limit exercise test ( e.g . severe peripheral vascular disease , COPD ) ; Ophthalmologic condition pertinent proliferative retinopathy condition preclude standard ophthalmologic examination . Cataract surgery within 6 month trial ; Vascular lesion anterior segment eye ( infection ulceration cornea , rubeotic glaucoma , etc ) ; Vascular lesion posterior segment eye proliferative retinopathy diabetic , macular edema , s/p photocoagulation macular edema proliferative retinopathy ; nondiabetics central branch retinal vascular occlusion , sickle cell retinopathy , ischemic retinopathy due retinal venous stasis carotid artery disease ) ; Choroidal new vessel associate agerelated macular degeneration , myopic degeneration , presume ocular histoplasmosis syndrome , angioid streak , pseudoxanthoma elasticum , without ocular disease ; Large elevate choroidal nevus , choroidal vascular tumor ( choroidal hemangioma ) , melanoma . Any acute illness within one week start study illness consider Investigator significantly interfere study outcome ; Clinical evidence active infection type , include adenovirus ( evidenced screen adenovirus neutralize antibody titer &gt; 1:50 ) ; Immunocompromised status ( investigator 's opinion ) currently receive immunosuppressive therapy ; Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 25 % measure LV angiography . Congestive heart failure NYHA class IIIIV ; Valvular heart disease require surgical intervention hemodynamically significant aortic valve disease ; Recent ( less 6 week prior screen ) Acute Coronary Syndrome increase CKMB Troponins/PCI/CABG/Stroke TIA ; History malignancy ( except cure nonmelanoma skin cancer ) suspicion current malignancy ; Known allergy diluent use suspend virus ; Other experimental medication within last four week prior second baseline ETT ; Revascularization procedure ( percutaneous coronary intervention coronary artery bypass ) within 4 month Day 1 . Participants previously receive VEGF angiogenic agent gene therapy past , participate investigational study within last year endpoint overlap .</criteria>
