	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Oral Topotecan Radiosensitizing Agent Patients With Rectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single center , phase I study design determine MTD oral topotecan radiosensitizing agent treatment rectal cancer patient . Sequential cohort three patient give increase dos oral topotecan fix dos concurrent radiation ( 45GY ) five week . The start dose oral topotecan 0.25mg/m2 concomitantly administer radiation ( 45Gy ) x 5 day every week unless radiation interrupt Holidays/Weekends toxicity require treatment delay occur . A total 25 dos plan . Doses escalate 0.15 mg/m2 increment thereafter subsequent cohort . Topotecan administer immediately daily radiation . All patient undergo rectal biopsy treatment begin treatment . Tissue submit H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center tumor marker assay . Tissue excise tumor time surgery also send study . Between day 10 14 treatment , colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy mandatory ensure quantitative estimate tumor shrinkage obtain repeat rectal biopsy . All patient undergo radiation therapy concurrently oral topotecan . Patients receive 180 cGY per fraction total dose 4500cGy ( conventional fractionation ) pelvis use 3 4 file technique high energy photon . Standardized field rectal cancer use include true pelvis ( mid sacrum least 2-3 centimeter inferior aspect tumor volume ) . Patients undergo surgery-either low anterior resection , abdominoperineal resection local excision . All patient offer postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy consist 5-Fluorouracil ( F-FU ) 350 mg/m2/day i.v . 5 day administer every 28 day times four cycle . Immediately prior administration 5-FU , leucovorin administer dose 20 mg/m2/day i.v . push daily 5 day every 28 day times four cycle .</detailed_description>

Patients primary tumor totally excised time diagnosis Patients recurrent rectal cancer fail initial treatment Patients previously treat topotecan Patients active infection Any known primary secondary immunodeficiency Any condition GI tract would affect GI absorption motility ( e.g. , autonomic neuropathy , active gastric duodenal ulcer certain gastrointestinal surgery ) . Patients receive medication maintain motility gastric empty also exclude . Patients uncontrolled emesis , regardless etiology . Concomitant malignancies previous malignancy within last five year , exception adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix low grade prostate cancer . Concurrent severe medical problem unrelated malignancy would significantly limit full compliance study expose patient significant risk . Patients child bear potential , practice adequate contraception ( barrier method IUD three month start study agree continue least 4 week end study ) Patients pregnant lactate Use investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose study medication .</criteria>
