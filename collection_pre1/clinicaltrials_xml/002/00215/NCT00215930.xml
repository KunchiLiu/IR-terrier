	<brief_summary>The standard treatment non-small cell lung cancer , stage IV IIIB malignant pleural effusion chemotherapy . The decision use regimen currently determine toxicity physician 's preference . In protocol , treatment regimen assign base patient ' tumor molecular profile . A tumor molecular profile analysis allow physician define specific molecular portrait show genetic basis tumor . This analysis result detail report determine chemotherapy assign patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The 'MADe IT ' Clinical Trial : Molecular Analyses Directed Individualized Therapy Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evaluation study entry include blood test , computerize tomography ( CT ) scan type scan need measure disease sit . A biopsy one tumor require tumor analysis . If patient 's cancer spread location may easier obtain tissue less invasive , biopsy specimen may collect one several possible location may exist within patient 's body . These possible site include lung , bone , liver , adrenal gland , lymph node , nodule skin , case brain involvement require surgery , brain tissue . Sometimes fluids build lining lung lung . If happen patient doctor tell fluid drain , fluid may also source cell use analyze patient cancer . In rare case , site might identify . Chemotherapy consist assign two drug . Chemotherapy repeat every three four week least two time . Patients CT scan measure tumor 's response . Response reduction tumor size , change tumor size , increase tumor size . Doing CT Scans test every two cycle chemotherapy assess response . If see favorable response continue chemotherapy maximum two time best response see patient 's tumor . If patient 's tumor grow large , discontinue study patient discus treatment option doctor . During treatment , blood specimen obtain check patient 's blood count begin end study , prior administration every dose chemotherapy . Approximately 3 teaspoonful ( 15 ml ) blood drawn time .</detailed_description>
