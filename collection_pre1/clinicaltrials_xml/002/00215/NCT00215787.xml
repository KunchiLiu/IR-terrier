	<detailed_description>Although nasal polyposis recognize inflammatory process many year , true etiology nasal polyposis mainly unknown . Despite surgical removal , recurrence rate surgery report high 87 % within first year surgery . Anecdotally Principal Investigator find incidence pH probe-proven laryngopharyngeal reflux approach 80 % patient nasal polyposis . Although number case small , incidence recurrence polyp patient 17 % . The PI believe association great explain chance alone , deserves study . He anticipate two contribution literature study , first document incidence extraesophageal ( laryngopharyngeal ) reflux patient polyposis , second show impact reflux treatment recurrence rate polyp , initially one year therapy . Eligible patient find nasal polyp offer chance participate study . They undergo non-invasive pH probe monitor 24 hour . If extraesophageal ( laryngopharyngeal ) reflux discover , provide ( cost ) proton pump inhibitor medication ( PPI ) , prescribe accordance publish standard otolaryngology literature . Their polyposis treat patient present polyposis ; participation study affect course polyp treatment . The incidence recurrence monitor record first year treatment . Included : Subjects adults nasal polyposis , recruit PI 's private practice , currently take PP ! , able willing undergo noninvasive 24 hour pH probe study , willing take PPI . Excluded : patient pregnant , history surgical treatment reflux disease , history allergic adverse reaction Prevacid adverse reaction Prevacid study period , meet inclusion criterion . In addition routine office otolaryngology examination , subject undergo noninvasive 24 hour esophageal pH probe monitoring . The probe swallow placed manner feed tube . The procedure do office . No sedation require , mucosa may spray topical 4 % lidocaine comfort . This procedure standard diagnosis extraesophageal ( laryngopharyngeal ) reflux , perform accordance manufacturer guideline Risks include temporary dysphagia probe place , nasal irritation . Mild , self-limited epistaxis rarely report The procedure do within manufcturer guideline direct vision . Topical Afrin may use control mild epistaxis . Topical 4 % lidocaine apply minimize dysphagia . These step proven affective minimize risk . If study hypothesis correct , patient may diminish risk recurrence nasal polyposis . If patient find previously undiagnosed reflux disease , allow treat appropriately . Undiagnosed/untreated reflux associate multiple medical problem include laryngeal esophageal cancer . The patient give PPI medication free charge duration study . The noninvasive pH probe study do free charge . No direct monetary payment give participant .</detailed_description>
