	<brief_summary>Recent report show people asthma particular gene , know GSTM1 null gene , susceptible effect air pollutant . The purpose research study learn volunteer asthma GSTM1 null gene increase response ( change lung function increase lung cell collect sputum ) compare volunteer asthma GSTM1 sufficient gene challenge 0.4 ppm ozone intermittent exercise . The principal purpose study identify hyper-responsive , responsive non-responsive group human subject mild asthma base airway neutrophilic response ozone exposure , perform analysis DNA airway cell explore possible difference genetic profile three group . An additional pilot aim compare expression small number specific gene interest subset ozone-responsive ozone-non-responsive subject mild asthma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fifty volunteer mild asthma recruit undergo ozone challenge control exposure facility US EPA Human Studies Division ( 104 Mason Farm Road , Chapel Hill , NC ) 0.4ppm 2 hour moderate exercise alternate rest . Endpoints include genetic analysis GSTM1 genotype , sputum spirometry change pre post exposure , blood endpoint pre post exposure . TRAINING DAY : ( least 3 day prior ozone challenge ) Eligible subject report research lab 3 hour training session . - All female volunteer undergo urine pregnancy test . - After informed consent obtain , Measurement orally exhale nitric oxide obtain - Subjects perform spirometry . - Subjects exercise treadmill determine workload actual exposure . - Finally subject undergo sputum induction follow pretreatment albuterol . The sputum assess quality determine continue eligibility . If subject provide acceptable sputum sample within prior 6 month may use inclusion criterion rather repeat induction point . After subject demonstrate production adequate sputum sample , schedule ozone exposure visit . 24 HOURS PRIOR exposure day ( Day 1 ) : Subjects ask refrain smoking well drink alcohol 24 hour prior Day 1 completion Day 3 . - Subjects vital sign oxygen saturation check , include symptom questionnaire . - They also undergo physical examination ear , nose , throat chest ( lung sound ) . - Female volunteer undergo urine pregnancy test . - Measurement orally exhale nitric oxide obtain . - Spirometry test perform . - Subjects sputum induction precede administration 2 puff albuterol . EXPOSURE DAY ( least 3 day train day ) : - Subjects ask arrive study site approximately 8 AM undergo assessment vital sign ( temperature , pulse , respiratory rate , blood pressure ) , oxygen saturation , symptom score assessment . - A telemetry unit place cardiac monitoring exposure . - Measurement orally exhale nitric oxide obtain prior exposure 4 hour end exposure - Spirometry test rule acute illness prior exposure . - They also undergo physical examination ear , nose , throat chest . - Exposure session : The 0.4 ppm ozone exposure conduct ozone exposure chamber . Each subject expose 0.4 ppm ozone 2 hour . During exposure , subject perform four 15 minute bout moderate exercise ( minute ventilation VE = 30 40 L/min ) treadmill , separate 15 minute seat rest . Minute ventilation measure 2 3 minute 4 minute exercise first exercise period , 12 minute exercise . It measure 12 minute exercise period . Two subject may expose simultaneously , case exercise/rest period alternate . - Immediately post exposure 4 hour completion exposure , subject assessment vital sign , oxygen saturation , symptom score assessment undergo spirometry evaluation . - Venipuncture : 20 ml blood collect CBC/ differential , assessment blood monocyte phagocytic function cell surface marker prior exposure 4 hour end exposure . A portion sample use genotyping . - Induced sputum collect 6 hour initiation exposure subject premedicated albuterol . The subject observe study site sputum induction complete . Subjects discharge home follow post-exposure sputum induction FEV1 within 90 % baseline value vital sign normal . Subjects meet safety criterion end exposure day admit GCRC overnight observation . 24 HOURS POST EXPOSURE ( Day 3 ) : The follow morning , approximately 24 hour exposure , volunteer subject assess directly study site . The subject undergo spirometry , vital sign monitor symptom scoring . STUDY DISCONTINUATION VISIT ( 5-10 day exposure ) : The volunteer subject assess directly study site . The subject undergo spirometry , vital sign monitor symptom scoring .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>healthy volunteer mild asthma Normal lung function , Oxygen saturation &gt; 94 % Normal blood pressure A history significant chronic illness Allergy medication may use prescribe course study ( albuterol , acetaminophen , aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent , corticosteroid , lactose , polyethylene glycol ) Positive pregnancy test within 48 hour time challenge Subjects currently take medication may impact result ozone challenge , interfere medication potentially use study ( include steroid , beta antagonist , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent ) suggest ongoing illness ( antibiotic ) . Mega dos vitamins supplement , homeopathic/naturopathic medicine Any acute , nonchronic , medical condition occur prior two week . Such illness must totally resolve symptomatically 2 week documentation normal lung function must obtain . Unspecified illness , judgment investigator might increase risk associate ozone inhalation challenge , basis exclusion . Physician direct emergency treatment asthma exacerbation within precede 12 month . Use systemic steroid therapy within precede 12 month . &gt; 0.5 pack year history tobacco use Use inhale steroid , cromolyn leukotriene inhibitor initiate within past month ( except use cromolyn exclusively prior exercise ) . Patients must stable regimen therapy . Use daily theophylline within past month . Pregnancy nurse baby . Nighttime symptoms cough wheeze great 1x/week baseline ( clearly recognize viral induced asthma exacerbation ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . Exacerbation asthma 2x/week would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . Daily requirement albuterol due asthma symptom ( cough , wheeze , chest tightness ) would characteristic person moderate severe persistent asthma outline current NHLBI guideline diagnosis management asthma . ( Not include prophylactic use albuterol prior exercise ) . Dosing level inhale steroid must consistent mild episodic asthma outline NHLBI NAEPP guideline . Use inhale steroid dos typically use moderate severe asthma result exclusion individual protocol . Students staff member work directly PI , Dr David Peden , exclude study participation</criteria>
