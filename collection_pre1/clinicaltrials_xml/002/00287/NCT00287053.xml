	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study identify mechanisms responsible weight gain associated Depakote treatment , identify method prevent treat weight gain people take Depakote . Both side energy balance equation measure sample healthy lean overweight adult . Energy intake measure Pennington Center 's Eating Laboratory , total daily energy expenditure ( TEE ) posture allocation measure IDEEA™ . Questionnaires assess food craving eat attitude behavior use determine behavioral phenotype associate weight gain response Depakote treatment . It hypothesize Depakote treatment result increase food intake . It also hypothesize time spend engage sedentary behavior increase response Depakote treatment . Time spent engaging , energy expend , physical activity expect decrease significantly . Therefore , hypothesize TEE expect decrease significantly . The result use identify specific behavioral target prevent weight gain treatment Depakote . Potential target include intervention modify food intake physical activity . The degree behavior ( food intake physical activity ) target dependent result study . For instance , majority weight gain associated Depakote treatment due change food intake , strong dietary intervention suggest . Additionally , change endocrine factor ( hormone peptide ) evaluate study determine Depakote associate altered endocrine response affect satiety , food intake , energy expenditure . If altered endocrine response find , result use identify adjunctive medication compound correct endocrine response reduce weight gain . Genomic study also possible , since gene sequence gene expression analyze archived buffy coat sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Divalproex Sodium Food Intake , Energy Expenditure , Posture Allocation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depakote ( Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Park , IL ) anti-convulsant medication use treat epilepsy [ 1 ] mania associate bipolar disorder [ 2 , 3 ] . Depakote also use prophylaxis migraine headache [ 4 ] . One side effect Depakote negatively influence appeal health care professional consumer weight gain . It unknown change energy intake , energy expenditure , combination responsible side effect . The purpose propose study : 1 ) test Depakote increase body weight increase food intake decrease energy expenditure , possibly change posture allocation , 2 ) identify method prevent treat weight gain people take Depakote . This randomized placebo-controlled trial measure side energy balance equation ( energy intake expenditure ) , posture allocation ( time spend active sedentary behavior , energy cost behavior ) . Measurement total daily energy expenditure ( TEE ) posture allocation provide powerful tool determine Depakote decrease energy expenditure increase time spend sedentary behavior . These data , along food intake data , provide test mechanism responsible weight gain associated Depakote , data identify method prevent treat weight gain . Divalproex sodium co-ordination compound consist sodium valproate valproic acid . The exact mechanism action Depakote unknown , believed increase brain concentration gamma aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) . Similarly , mechanism Depakote increase body weight understood . The balance energy intake expenditure influence body weight ; therefore , Depakote likely alters energy intake , energy expenditure , . Alterations energy intake expenditure result , associate , change biological mechanism , include hormone peptide level . To knowledge , one study test effect compound contain valproic acid energy intake expenditure , study small ( n = 8 ) , uncontrolled , use method measure energy intake ( food record recall ) unlikely detect change small sample [ 5 ] . The study propose herein first study test effect Depakote eat behavior , measure laboratory , energy expenditure posture allocation , measure Intelligent Device Energy Expenditure Activity ( IDEEA™ ; MiniSun LLC , Fresno , CA ) . In vitro , leptin secretion mRNA level adipocytes decrease response valproic acid , believe alter leptin level might influence weight gain people take compound contain valproic acid [ 6 ] . Other researcher report postprandial insulin proinsulin level increase people take valproic acid , BMI positively relate two-hour postprandial level insulin , proinsulin , C-peptide [ 7 ] . Luef colleague indicate treatment valproic acid might increase glucose stimulated pancreatic section , could relate high body weight due two factor related pancreatic beta-cell regulation insulin secretion . First , valproic acid free-fatty acid ( FFA ) derivative competes FFAs albumin binding , , second , valproic acid GABA agonist . Thus , valproic acid treatment might increase glucose stimulated pancreatic secretion contribute weight gain . Evidence laboratory suggest valproic acid treatment child increase insulin level decrease glucose level , might stimulate appetite [ 8 ] . Importantly , Demir Aysun note carnitine level correlate weight gain , suggest valproic acid induce weight gain due impairment beta-oxidation fatty acid . Carnitine involve transfer fatty acid mitochondria beta-oxidation . Due potential role FFA valproic acid influence pancreatic beta-cell regulation insulin secretion , FFA measure present study baseline ( day 0 ) day 21 , ½ hour one hour food intake test lunch . Due likelihood hormone peptide influence weight gain associated Depakote , blood sample archive later analysis , pending availability fund . Specifically , portion archive use measure gastric inhibitory polypeptide ( GIP ) oxyntomodulin . Oxyntomodulin GIP assay immediately commercially available assay kit yet available . Oxyntomodulin implicate control food intake satiety human animal [ 9 ] , GIP modulate insulin secretion might provide new treatment diabetes [ 10 ] . Additionally , level PYY3-36 , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , leptin , ghrelin measure . PYY3-36 GLP-1 distal gut hormone find reduce food intake [ 9 , 11 ] . PYY3-36 decrease food intake 30 % infused human [ 11 ] , obese human rodent attenuate fast post-prandial PYY3-36 level likely associate obesity [ 12 ] . GLP-1 also decrease food intake rodent man , work synergistically PYY3-36 [ 13 ] . Leptin reduce food intake [ 14 ] increase energy expenditure human [ 15 ] , ghrelin increase food intake likely important regulator food intake [ 16 ] . The aforementioned hormone sample ½ hour one hour start food intake test lunch day 0 21 . The timing sample base find PYY3-36 GLP-1 peak one hour meal [ 17 , 18 ] . Therefore , compare level prior meal change meal Depakote placebo group . Different pre-meal level hormone peptide correlate food intake group , differential change hormone response meal evaluate group correlate food intake . Two factor likely affect amount weight gain Depakote treatment gene sequence gene expression . Although analysis costly , DNA material , include RNA , archive whole blood sample store later analysis . This method allow cost control since analysis conduct sub-sample participant display specific reaction treatment study . For example , genomic study conduct participant fall within low upper quartile weight gain , sub-sample participant placebo treatment group . This provide empirical test priori state hypothesis without need endure cost run genomic analysis entire sample participant . In present study , gene sequence gene expression study make possible archive blood sample , outline Methods section . These analysis depend availability fund development specific testable hypothesis ( e.g. , weight gain Depakote group associate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma gene ) .</detailed_description>
