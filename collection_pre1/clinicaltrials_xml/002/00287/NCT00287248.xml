	<brief_summary>This research design obtain efficacy safety information 123-I IMPY imaging biomarker Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The distribution agent measure obtain single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) image brain serially time determine relative localization radiopharmaceutical region cortex relative background region develop optimal technique radiotracer administration ( bolus bolus constant infusion ) . The researcher evaluate utility 123-I IMPY SPECT AD patient early diagnostic tool subsequently serial evaluation AD patient perform determine technique may useful tool evaluation progressive brain β-amyloid deposition AD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All study procedure conduct Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders ( IND ) Molecular NeuroImanging ( MNI ) New Haven , CT . Approximately 25 patient mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) 20 healthy control recruit participate study . AD patient eligible participate diagnosis AD le 3 year duration . Healthy control examined ensure evidence neurodegenerative change include cognitive decline . All subject undergo write informed consent screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation baseline cognitive evaluation . Subjects ask undergo either bolus injection bolus injection follow continuous infusion 123-I IMPY . Following injection , subject undergo serial SPECT imaging scan serial venous plasma sample measurement 123-I IMPY plasma ( protein bound free ) 3.5 - 8 hour period . The imaging analyse perform image-processing specialist remain masked procedure employ image acquisition . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express brain tissue plasma ratio radioligand , 123-I IMPY .</detailed_description>
