	<brief_summary>Ozone cause acute airway inflammation asthmatic normal volunteer . However , asthmatic ozone cause episode worsen asthma . We want learn chronic allergic response , know `` IgE-induced airway inflammation '' cause increase inflammation response ozone . To examine response ozone group asthmatic treat omalizumab , medicine available approve use people asthma , placebo control . The placebo study inert physiologic saline ( `` salt water '' ) contain omalizumab . Both omalizumab placebo administer injection skin . Omalizumab , also call Xolair , humanize monoclonal antibody , mean originally produce mouse , genetically engineer look like human mouse antibody . Omalizumab inactivate IgE , protein immune system make part allergic reaction . The purpose study test hypothesis omalizumab , block aspect allergic reaction , decrease number inflammatory cell airway ozone challenge . We also hypothesize omalizumab decrease effect ozone change lung function , mucociliary clearance ( measure quickly mucus clear form airway ) airway reactivity . Airway reactivity measure sensitive airway medication use diagnose asthma , call methacholine . We examine additional information learn course study . This blind study , mean neither researcher know get active drug placebo , information obtain need . The placebo injection inert physiological saline ( `` salt water '' ) contain omalizumab .</brief_summary>

Study Discontinuation Visit ( 5-10 day last exposure ) History , spirometry ( SC ) , medical evaluation need ( Investigator MD ) Dosages ozone omalizumab Ozone : The 0.4 ppm ozone exposure conduct ozone exposure chamber . Each subject expose ozone 2 hour . During exposure , subject perform four 15 minute bout moderate exercise ( minute ventilation VE = 30 40 L/min ) treadmill , separate 15 minute seat rest . Minute ventilation measure 2-3 minute 4 minute exercise first exercise period , 12 minute exercise . It measure 12 minute exercise period . Omalizumab : Dosing omalizumab consistent dos approve use moderate severe allergic asthma . The exception indicate use examine effect mild ( rather moderate severe ) allergic asthmatic , group recruit ozone challenge . IgE within follow range body weight subcutaneous omalizumab dosing : 1 .
