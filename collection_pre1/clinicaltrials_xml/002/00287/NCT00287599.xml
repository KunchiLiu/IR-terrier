	<brief_summary>The military subject traumatic wound various type severity . Such wound predispose infection 1 ) tend extensive deep , 2 ) may affect area normal carriage potentially pathogenic bacteria gastrointestinal tract , upper respiratory tract , female genital tract , 3 ) typically produce tissue damage , 4 ) may introduce foreign body , 5 ) may interfere local blood supply , 6 ) tend produce ischemia , edema hemorrhage , 7 ) may complicate fracture burn 8 ) may lead shock overwhelm body 's systemic defense . It always possible military setting cleanse debride wind promptly effectively promptly provide surgery event damage vital structure . In active military setting , probability wound infection follow trauma relatively high . In absence rapid identification infect flora provision information antimicrobial susceptibility , clinician must resort empiric therapy rather tailor therapy . There tendency use one top available agent would likely active vast majority bacteria . This lead increase antimicrobial resistance , important problem . The investigator hypothesize use molecular biology technique provide identification microorganism responsible wound infection rapidly accurately . The investigator evaluate real-time PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) technique proposal . This procedure apply directly material wound without need first grow organism . It use define total flora wound within five hour . The investigator first develop primer probe detect various bacteria anticipate give wound certain location . These primer probe use real-time PCR rapid accurate identification wound flora . The information obtain real-time PCR quantitative one may judge relative importance different isolates . The investigator also use another molecular approach , 16S rRNA gene cloning , conventional culture ; provide information flora various wound . Definitive identification anaerobe provide quickly , along information usual antimicrobial susceptibility pattern , life-saving shorten course infection considerably .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Identification Key Pathogens Wound Infection Molecular Means</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Wound infection typically mixed , anaerobic non-anaerobic bacteria present usually anaerobes aerobe ( example , perforate gangrenous appendicitis , find average 9 anaerobes 3 aerobe ) . Many clinical laboratory limit anaerobic bacteriology , use commercial kit base inadequate phenotypic characteristic inaccurate taxonomy . As result , physician surgeon must treat wound infection empirically tend use drug active resistant anaerobes lead increase resistance antimicrobial . Molecular technique available permit accurate rapid characterization microorganism , aerobic anaerobic . Objective/Hypothesis : The use molecular biology technique provide identification microorganism responsible wound infection rapidly accurately . The current conventional method culture identification phenotypic test slow inaccurate . Specific Aims : 1 ) Develop rapid identification method , include quantitation , important wound pathogen , 2 ) Analyze bacterial flora wound infection molecular mean conventional culturing ; tissue biopsy pus studied methodology , 3 ) Determine incidence significance so-called `` uncultivable '' flora . Study Design : We study 50 postoperative traumatic wound infection 50 close soft tissue abscesses intravenous drug abuser annually , general surgical service Olive View County Hospital , affiliate UCLA VA Medical Center West Los Angeles , collaboration Dr. Robert Bennion . Whenever possible , obtain tissue biopsy active edge wound processing , along pu wound . We develop species-specific primers/probes organisms encounter different type wound infection base information flora wound infection obtain previous study group others supplement primers/probes make cultural isolates previously encounter . The primer probe use high-throughput procedure ( real-time PCR ) permit rapid identification quantitation organism . The entire procedure , include DNA extraction real-time PCR , complete within 5 hour one sample . Multiple sample do concurrently . While may necessary start therapy empirically , possible change appropriate antimicrobial agent bacteriologic data becomes available 5 hour . Concurrently , utilize another molecular approach , 16S rRNA gene cloning , analyze total flora sample . We first amplify 16S rRNA gene use universal ( bacteria ) primer PCR DNA extract sample . Then , clone library construct E. coli clone study 16S rDNA sequence ~1500 base pair . This permit detection organism call `` uncultivable '' , well organisms culture successfully . Any `` uncultivable '' organism encounter frequently may important ; therefore , develop primer probe rapid identification use variety technique attempt cultivate ( do successfully case already ) . At time molecular approach do , use conventional cultural processing . The cultural approach provide organism additional study ( especially antimicrobial susceptibility test ) serve current standard comparison new molecular approach . Culture do semiquantitatively identification do 16S rDNA sequencing supplement phenotypic test indicate . The cultural approach typically take several day isolate organisms pure culture . The two molecular approach compare conventional cultural approach term organisms detect ; specimen study technique , comparative purpose . Relevance : The speed various identification scheme indicate show clearly would able provide accurate , quantitative identification ( accurate conventional cultural approach ) great deal sooner possible past . This lead much early application appropriate therapy minimize empiric use powerful agent . This likely result improve clinical outcome , less chance antimicrobial resistance , cost saving well . It provide u much accurate picture infect flora various surgical wound antimicrobial susceptibility pattern organism . We learn whether , burn wound infection , quantitative study tissue biopsy provide good picture true infect flora conventional wound culture . We learn whether `` uncultivable '' bacteria ( actually make great percentage indigenous flora bowel upper respiratory tract ) important clinically . Finally , develop complete set primers/probes improve molecular approach .</detailed_description>
