	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . Sometimes , tumor may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well give combination chemotherapy together surgery radiation therapy work treat infant neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Register child &lt; 12 month age diagnose neuroblastoma . - Evaluate possible prognostic factor patient particular reference collection biological material . - Correlate outcome factor stage patient . - Determine criterion modify treatment child advance disease without impair survival . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients assign 1 4 treatment group accord disease stage . - Group 1 ( stage 1 , 2A , 2B disease ) : Patients undergo surgical resection tumor . Patients paraspinal tumor may receive chemotherapy* shrink tumor undergo surgery . Patients local recurrence surgery proceed treatment group 3 . Patients metastatic recurrence surgery proceed treatment group 4 . - Group 2 ( stage 4S disease ) : Patients undergo observation . Patients hepatomegaly progressive disease may receive chemotherapy* . Patients respond chemotherapy may undergo 4 course radiotherapy . - Group 3 ( stage 3 disease ) : Patients receive OPEC chemotherapy comprise vincristine IV cyclophosphamide IV day 1 , cisplatin IV continuously 24 hour day 1 , etoposide IV 4 hour day 3 course 1 , 3 , 5 . Patients receive OJEC chemotherapy comprise vincristine IV , cyclophosphamide IV , etoposide IV 4 hour , carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 course 2 , 4 , 6 . Courses repeat every 3 week alternate OPEC OJEC chemotherapy 6 course . Patients residual disease receive 4 additional course alternate OPEC OJEC chemotherapy . Patients whose tumor become resectable either 6 10 course chemotherapy undergo surgery . Patients residual disease 10 course chemotherapy assess regular scan . Patients disease progression scan undergo radiotherapy . Patients ganglioneuroma total necrosis evidence neuroblastoma either 6 10 course chemotherapy receive treatment . - Group 4 ( stage 4 disease ) : Patients receive alternate course OPEC OJEC 6 course group 3 . Patients achieve metastatic complete response ( CR ) receive 4 additional course alternate OPEC OJEC chemotherapy . Patients achieve metastatic CR either 6 10 course chemotherapy undergo surgery remove tumor . Patients macroscopic residual disease resect specimen receive 4 additional course alternate OPEC OJEC chemotherapy undergo biopsy . Patients residual disease biopsy assess regular scan . Patients disease progression scan undergo radiotherapy . Patients ganglioneuroma total necrosis surgery without 4 additional course chemotherapy receive treatment . NOTE : * OJEC chemotherapy lower dose carboplatin After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 120 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
