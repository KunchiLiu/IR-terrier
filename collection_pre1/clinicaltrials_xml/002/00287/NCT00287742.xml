	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Safety Risperidone Versus Placebo Treatment Patients With Hallucinations Delusions Associated With Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dementia frequently observe elderly , often associate psychotic symptom delusion hallucination , behavioral disturbance aggressive behavior , wander , aimless behavior induce psychotic symptom . Based result preliminary clinical study , risperidone expect beneficial treatment psychotic symptom behavioral disturbance associate Alzheimer 's disease . This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study risperidone tablet placebo tablet take twice daily 9 week patient hallucination delusion associate Alzheimer 's disease . During one week run-in period , patient take one tablet twice daily . During 8 week double-blind period , dose give twice daily flexible dose regimen 0.5 2 mg risperidone per day , placebo . The primary measure effectiveness change Behavioral Pathology Alzheimer 's Disease ( BEHAVE-AD ) psychotic symptom cluster score baseline intermediate visit study end ( Week 9 ) compare placebo . BEHAVE-AD scale use global assessment symptom associate dementia . Additional assessment effectiveness include Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory ( CMAI ) , assessment aggressiveness non-aggressiveness , Clinical Global Impression - Change ( CGI-C ) , measure improve aggravated condition . Safety evaluation include incidence adverse event , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , laboratory test ( biochemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) , assessment extrapyramidal symptom . The study hypothesis treatment twice daily risperidone effective placebo measure BEHAVE-AD psychotic symptom cluster score patient hallucination delusion associate Alzheimer 's disease . Oral risperidone tablets 0.25 mg placebo tablet twice daily , increase weekly increment 0.5 mg/day maximum 2 mg/day ; total daily dosage maintain 9 week .</detailed_description>
