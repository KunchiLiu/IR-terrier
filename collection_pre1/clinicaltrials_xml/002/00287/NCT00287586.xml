	<brief_summary>As men grow old , testosterone level decrease age . One-third men , 70 year age old , low testosterone level . It known short-term testosterone replacement safe , increase muscle strength physical function , risk long-term testosterone replacement old men low testosterone level incompletely understood . Atherosclerosis characterize thicken artery wall , narrow blood vessel cholesterol deposit lining artery . It major cause cardiovascular disease include ischemic heart disease ( heart attack ) stroke . Although , historically , widespread perception high level testosterone might increase risk atherosclerosis , evidence research support . In observational study , high testosterone level correlate favorable cardiovascular risk factor , supplementation testosterone bring old men normal range healthy young men appear improve several cardiovascular risk factor , may slow progression atherosclerosis . The primary purpose study look effect testosterone replacement progression atherosclerosis old men . This study also do find whether replacement testosterone old men low testosterone level improve health-related quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testosterone Replacement Older Men Atherosclerosis Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although short-term administration testosterone replacement dose relatively safe , risks long-term testosterone administration old men remain poorly understood . The two major area concern include potential increase risk atherosclerotic heart disease exacerbation pre-existing , subclinical prostate cancer ( 1-3 ) . There widespread perception testosterone supplementation adversely affect plasma lipoprotein profile increase risk atherosclerotic heart disease ; premise support data ( 4 ) . Thus , long-term consequence testosterone supplementation risk atherosclerosis progression remain unknown . While supraphysiological dos testosterone non-aromatizable androgen frequently employ body-builders undoubtedly decrease plasma HDL-cholesterol level ( 5-9 ) , physiologic testosterone replacement old men associate modest decrease plasma HDL-cholesterol ( 10-13 ) . Cross-sectional study middle-aged men ( 14-16 ) find direct , rather inverse , relationship serum testosterone level plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration well inverse correlation serum testosterone level visceral fat volume . Testosterone supplementation middle-aged men truncal obesity associate reduction visceral fat volume , serum glucose concentration , blood pressure , improvement insulin sensitivity ( 17-19 ) . All change associate low risk atherosclerosis . These data suggest serum testosterone level range mid-normal healthy young men consistent optimal cardiovascular risk profile age , testosterone concentration either physiologic male range may increase risk atherosclerotic heart disease . Studies LDL-receptor deficient mouse provide compel evidence testosterone retard early atherogenesis , testosterone effect atherogenesis mediate conversion estradiol action aromatase enzyme express vessel wall . The effect testosterone replacement cardiovascular risk human never directly examine . Therefore , primary objective study examine directly effect testosterone replacement atherosclerosis progression men measure common carotid artery intima-media thickness ( CCA IMT ) coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) multidetector compute tomography ( MDCT ) , two independent measurement generalize atherosclerosis . The second objective study determine whether physiologic testosterone replacement old men low testosterone level improve health-related quality life . Aging-associated decline physical , sexual , cognitive function contributes diminish quality life old men ( 20-31 ) . Although pathophysiology impairment subdomains health-related quality life complex multifactorial , one correctable cause diminish quality life old men decrease serum testosterone concentration ( 32-54 ) . Total free testosterone ( T ) level decline advance age normal men ( 13-37 ) , significant number men meet usual criterion hypogonadism sixth seventh decade ( 55 ) . Spontaneous ( 56 ) experimentally-induced ( 57 ) androgen-deficiency young men associate decreased muscle mass strength impair sexual function . Because loss muscle mass function contributes diminish health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) old men , anabolic therapy testosterone increase muscle mass strength , would expect improve physical function . In old men low testosterone level , testosterone might also improve sexual function marital interaction ( 11-13 , 53 , 58-62 ) . A grow body literature suggest testosterone impact neuronal functioning may affect cognitive performance . Because physical , sexual , cognitive function important determinant health-related quality life , testosterone replacement old men low testosterone level would expect improve general health perception . The age human recent evolutionary event . Of thousand generation men woman live planet , human last two generation could hop live past age 50 ! The population get proportionally old . The number people 85 year age old today substantially great begin 20th century . Advancing age associate decreased muscle mass strength , impairment physical , sexual , cognitive function . Diminished muscle mass strength increase risk fall , disability poor quality life . Age-related impairment sexual cognitive function also contribute overall reduction quality life . Testosterone replacement , improve aspect physical , sexual cognitive function , would expect improve health-related quality life . Previous study establish testosterone replacement old men low testosterone level increase muscle mass strength . However , lack information two area prevent formulation general recommendation wider use testosterone replacement old men . First , effectiveness testosterone improve physical function , quality life , health-related outcome demonstrate . Second , agreement short-term administration testosterone replacement dose safe , long-term risk testosterone supplementation old men remain unknown . The area major concern risk prostate cancer heart disease . Because high prevalence , even small increase incidence rate atherosclerotic heart disease associate testosterone supplementation significant impact overall morbidity mortality , health care cost . The study evaluate one important aspect long-term safety testosterone administration directly examine effect rate progression atherosclerosis . If study demonstrate testosterone retard atherosclerosis progression , would provide one additional reason testosterone supplementation old men low testosterone level . If study demonstrate neutral effect testosterone atherosclerosis progression , information would also reassure useful regulatory agency . This study establish efficacy testosterone replacement improve physical , sexual cognitive function major determinant health-related quality life old men . In spite paucity efficacy safety data , sale testosterone androgenic product witness explosive growth increase medium attention public interest . During summer 2000 , testosterone-related story cover Time , Newsweek , New York Times , Los Angeles Times ! The prescription sale testosterone grow 25-30 % annual rate since 1993 , almost double year 2000 , cumulatively increase 500 % since 1993 ( Source : IMS Sales Data , provide Reed Selby , Marketing Director ALZA Corporation ) . The grow testosterone use old men , without clear understand benefit long-term risk , raise concern among regulatory agency . The propose study provide definitive information effect testosterone replacement several measure efficacy safety old men would facilitate analysis risk : benefit ratio .</detailed_description>
