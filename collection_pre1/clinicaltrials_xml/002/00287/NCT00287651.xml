	<brief_title>Effects Pulsatile IV Insulin Delivery Diabetic Retinopathy Patients With Types 1 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy one leading cause blindness world . Signs retinopathy detect almost 100 % type 1 diabetic patient disease least 20 year almost 100 % type 2 diabetic patient similar duration disease ( 1 ) . Histopathologic finding range microaneurysms cotton wool spot ominous neovascularization . The latter process , know proliferative diabetic retinopathy , progress total blindness untreated . The biochemical mechanism responsible PDR extensively study , appear multifactorial . Associated finding include abnormality vasoactive peptide vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , pigment epithelium derive factor ( PEDF ) , insulin-like growth factor ( ILF-1 ) , lipid , oxidative pathway , enzymatic pathway , protein kinase , carbohydrate metabolism ( 1-4 ) . Whether ( ) factor interrelate common underlying defect unknown . The common endpoint , however , vascular leakage neovascularization . Current therapeutic regimen base biochemical abnormality date unsuccessful stem progression proliferative diabetic retinopathy . Current treatment strategy emphasize glycemic blood pressure control , laser photocoagulation vitrectomy advanced case ( 5 ) . Early retinal disease diabetic patient may take form diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . This observe 20 % 25 % type 1 type 2 diabetic patient . The pathophysiology DME involve leakage plasma small vessel macula . Resorption fluid follow hard exudate formation lead severe impairment central vision ( 6 ) . Anecdotal evidence ophthalmologic institution ( Houston Eye Institute , Shands University Florida , Bascom Palmer Eye Institute ) suggest treatment arrest progression retinal disease patient proliferative diabetic retinopathy . The mechanism effect unknown , may relate reversal retinal ischemia downregulation vasoactive peptide restoration hepatic metabolism . Protocol This study design prospective , control , single blind evaluation pulsatile insulin role diabetic retinopathy . The patient enter study two distinct source . First , conjunction national eye image company , patient know type 1 type 2 diabetes evaluate retinal disease . This evaluation consist mydriatic fundus photography diabetic patient recent ophthalmologic evaluation ( period great 12 month ) . The fundus photograph read observer auspex Wilmer Ophthalmologic Institute Johns Hopkins Hospital . Classifications patient evaluate study include : I Patients non high risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy II Patients severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy Patients diagnose one classification offer entrance study . Study patient match age , sex , disease severity treatment control group . All study patient evaluate conjunction ophthalmologist . This evaluation include clinical examination fundus photography . Treatment group patient undergo weekly pulsatile insulin delivery session per protocol . Control group patient weekly clinic visit maximize glycemic hypertensive control . All patient repeat fundus photography three month interval , ophthalmologic evaluation every six month , often request ophthalmologist .</detailed_description>
