	<detailed_description>This phase II study ass proportion subject remain progression-free 27th week follow onset treatment assess efficacy combination Bevacizumab Erlotinib prolong time progression subject inoperable metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma . Subjects treat combination rhuMAb VEGF ( Bevacizumab ) , combination Erlotinib TTP assess per RECIST criterion . The disease evaluate base line every 9 week CT scan/MRI AFP level . Subjects keep study till disease progression ( define RECIST criterion ) death .</detailed_description>
