	<brief_summary>Our specific aim include : 1 . AIM 1 . Characterization glucose tolerance , nutritional clinical status , socioeconomic status , family history diabetes genotype Hispanic CF child compare Caucasian CF child . Each child undergo two-hour oral glucose tolerance test categorize glucose tolerance accord standard set forth 1998 CF Consensus Conference Diabetes . Nutritional status determine three-day food journal intake compare energy need measure indirect calorimetry . Socio-economic status calculate report family income medical insurance coverage . Genotyping do laboratory Dr. Arthur Beaudet Baylor College Medicine . Clinical status measure use modify NIH score . Family history type 1 type 2 diabetes obtain Spanish Dr.Vanderwel . This specific aim test hypothesis glucose intolerance /frank CF relate diabetes occurs young age Hispanics Caucasians CF , correlate family history diabetes clinical status . 2 . AIM 2 . Characterization insulin secretion insulin sensitivity . Previous study adult describe peripheral insulin resistance major cause CF relate diabetes , yet study conduct child . Studies adults child without CF suggest insulin resistance occur frequently Hispanics . We measure insulin secretion insulin sensitivity use frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test ( IVGTT ) minimal model analysis Bergman , modify child . This specific aim test hypothesis Hispanic child CF bad peripheral insulin resistance , similar insulin secretion compare Caucasian child CF . 3 . AIM 3 . Quantification post-absorptive gluconeogenesis whole body protein turnover . Total hepatic glucose production ( HGP ) measure use [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose . We quantify gluconeogenesis measurement incorporation 2H 2nd , 5th 6th carbon glucose follow 2H20 administration method Landau ) . We determine whole body protein turnover use stable isotope [ 1-13C ] leucine measure serum amino acid level . This specific aim test hypothesis gluconeogenesis whole body protein turnover disproportionately higher Hispanic child adolescent CF Caucasian CF child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We recruit 12 Hispanic prepubertal child CF ( age 7-12 , Tanner I ) 12 Hispanic adolescent ( age 15-17 , Tanner 3 4 ) CF Centers University Texas Southwestern Baylor College Medicine Houston . Information obtain subject compare 12 prepubertal 12 adolescent Caucasian child CF recruit CF center . We categorize subject accord glucose tolerance ( OGTT ) , well insulin secretion insulin sensitivity use IVGTT Minimal Model , modify child . We also compare historical information socio-economic status family history . Clinical status characterize measure pulmonary function modify NIH score , addition measuring level circulate cytokine . Gluconeogenesis ( GNG ) quantify measure incorporation 2H 2nd , 5th 6th carbon glucose . Whole body protein turnover ( WBPT ) measure use [ 1-13C ] leucine . Nutritional status determine three-day food journal , intake compare energy need , utilize indirect calorimetry measure rest energy expenditure . Subjects recruit CF center University Texas- Southwestern South Central CF Consortium .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects require medically stable time study . Medical stability define : 1 . No hospital admission six week study 2 . No oral intravenous antibiotic least six week precede study ( subject allow use low dos inhaled corticosteroid ) 3 . Weightstable ( weight deviation less 2.5 kilogram ) two month prior study . 1 . Use oral intravenous corticosteroid medication within six week study 2 . Evidence severe liver disease ( hepatomegaly , 30 % great elevation liver transaminase , list liver transplant ) 3 . Colonization Burkholderia cepacia 4 . Pregnancy 5 . Patients require supplemental oxygen .</criteria>
