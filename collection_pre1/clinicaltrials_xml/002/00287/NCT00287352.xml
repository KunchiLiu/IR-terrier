	<brief_summary>Weight gain associate antipsychotic medication use major side effect limit tolerability drug . This often significant weight gain adversely affect health , increase risk develop cardiovascular disease , diabetes , sleep apnea , cancer colon , kidney , uterus , endometrium esophagus osteoarthritis . Beasley colleague ( 1997 ) report 40.5 % olanzapine-treated patient gain 7 % baseline weight . Much olanzapine induce weight gain occur early treatment , antipsychotic-na√Øve young patient ( Woods et al. , 2002 ) particularly vulnerable side effect . One promising medication aid weight loss patient take olanzapine amantadine . Attempts prevent weight gain expect successful attempt reverse occurs . It common clinical practice educate patient begin treatment olanzapine , antipsychotic , healthy eat need exercise . However , despite effort , weight gain population continue . Beginning weight-stabilizing medication low threshold weight gain occur may significant impact patient ' health willingness continue take antipsychotic . We propose investigate efficacy amantadine weight-stabilizing agent population first-episode psychotic subject begin treatment antipsychotic agent . This population generally young medically healthy , without contraindication amantadine . They often normal body mass index without obesity-related medical problem . They much gain prevent weight gain often progress steadily course treatment , difficult reverse result significant morbidity mortality . Additionally , first episode psychotic population tends take few concomitant psychiatric medication . This important since medication may cause weight gain ( long term use mirtazapine , lithium , depakote ) weight loss ( short term use SSRI 's ) could confound effectiveness amantadine combat weight gain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Amantadine Weight Stabilization During Olanzapine Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening : Screening include demographic , medical psychiatric history clinical interview determine psychiatric diagnosis . Screening also include physical examination laboratory assessment ( CBC , electrolytes , kidney function , liver function , TSH ) rule concurrent medical illness could contraindication amantadine treatment . Blood also draw fast lipid profile , glucose , insulin , C reactive protein , adiponectin , leptin . Subjects also option allow u draw 2 additional tube yet determine study , include HIV genetic testing . Subjects also option allow u draw 1 additional tube platelet-specific protein assay , term SEPT5 . The rationale measure SEPT5 level test hypothesis individual clinically-defined mental disorder alter level protein circulate blood platelet . A urine drug screen perform . Phase 1 : Subjects may enter Phase 1 within first 12 week treatment olanzapine . At entry Phase 1 , anthropometric measurement take ( height , weight , waist hip circumference ) BMI calculate . Baseline assessment include questionnaire hunger ( do fast state ) ( Subjective Satiety Scale ) , activity ( Baeckea Activity Questionnaire ) , respiratory quotient ( RQ ) rest energy expenditure ( REE ) assess use Medgraphics metabolic cart , body composition determine dual x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA , Hologic Delphia ) . Prior every DXA scan Body Composition Lab personnel administer safety questionnaire woman reproductive age blood pregnancy test . Visits schedule weekly monitor weight provide healthy lifestyle counsel base Solutions Wellness program develop Lilly . During first 3 week , subject call research personnel per week complete 24 hour diet recall phone . During first 4 week study , RQ capillary glucose repeat weekly since anticipate change parameter may occur early . At monthly interval clinical interview monitor change psychosis blood pressure assess . When subject gain 1 BMI unit , fast bloodwork baseline assessment repeat enrolled Phase 2 . Subjects gain 1 BMI unit within 12 week olanzapine treatment end study participation end Phase 1 . Phase 2 : Subjects may enter Phase 2 follow Phase 1 enter directly documentation 1 less 3 BMI unit weight gain start olanzapine within previous 12 week . Phase 2 double blind placebo control addition amantadine ongoing olanzapine therapy . All subject enter Phase 2 anthropometric measurement , BMI calculate . Fasting lipid profile , glucose , insulin , C reactive protein , adiponectin , leptin obtain , liver function test urine drug screen . Body composition DXA well RQ REE determine . Prior every DXA scan Body Composition Lab administer safety questionnaire woman reproductive age pregnancy test . A Food Propensity questionnaire administer document recent trend food choice , exercise hunger questionnaire also do . Following completion baseline assessment , randomization amantadine placebo occur . Subjects begin take 1 capsule daily 2 day , 2 capsule daily 5 day , 3 capsule daily . Amantadine capsule contain 100 mg amantadine . Clinical state emergence side effect , include orthostatic hypotension , monitor visit research clinician . If subject experience mild side effect increase number capsule , titration slow . During Phase 2 , subject call research personnel 3 nonconsecutive day complete 24 hour diet recall phone . Biweekly , subject meet study physician nurse standardize healthy lifestyle counsel base Solutions Wellness program available Lilly . BMI calculate biweekly baseline measure repeat final study visit . Urine pregnancy test perform monthly woman . When subject gain additional 3 BMI unit ( approximately 15 lb ) , complete 16 week double blind medication repeat Visit 13 measure end study participation .</detailed_description>
