	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Fibromatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine non-progression rate patient recurrent refractory aggressive fibromatosis 3 month treatment imatinib mesylate . Secondary - Determine non-progression rate patient treat drug 12 month . - Determine toxic effect drug patient . - Determine tolerance drug patient . - Determine response rate patient treat drug - Determine progression free overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine quality life patient treated drug . - Correlate clinical , biological , genomic marker response long-term stable disease patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 39 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
