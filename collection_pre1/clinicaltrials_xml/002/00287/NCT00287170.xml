	<brief_summary>The study undertaken evaluate whether delayed-release medication , design begin open low intestinal tract , main site Crohn 's Disease , effective standard systemically deliver drug promote remission response CD patient . It hypothesize delayed-release medication go right injured tissue heal disease quickly . The delayed-release test drug 6-mercaptopurine ( dose 40 mg daily ) calcitriol ( dose 5 mcg three time week ) versus Purinethol ( 6-MP dose 1-2 mg/kg body weight daily ) . Calcitriol synthetically manufacture replica natural substance body derive Vitamin D. There much medical evidence show lack Vitamin D possible risk factor develop autoimmune disorder , include Crohn 's Disease . Moreover , calcitriol show animal model improve symptom Crohn 's Disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Targeted , Local Delivery Drugs Treat Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot clinical study design evaluate efficacy safety oral administration novel , delayed-release test formulation , target delivery ileum Crohn 's Disease patient . The local delivery drug ( delayed-release formulation 6-mercaptopurine calcitriol ) compare standard Purinethol treatment 12 week treatment evaluate : - ( 1 ) local intestinal mucosal inflammation damage show marker biopsy tissue ( CDEIS pathologist review biopsy ) ; - ( 2 ) Clinical symptom active Crohn 's Disease [ CDAI scores- remission &lt; 150 ; response- drop 100 point baseline ; IBDQ scores- &gt; = 180 indicative remission ] ; - ( 3 ) Systemic improvement show blood immunological inflammatory marker ( CRP ESR ) . It hypothesize since CD localize autoimmune inflammation intestinal mucosa , far effective , potentially safe treatment would target , local delivery effective drug directly disease site . The drug would concentrate specific area disease , unwanted systemic side effect would minimize . The drug select evaluation 6-MP ( mainstay CD treatment 30 year ) calcitriol , synthetically manufacture Vitamin D derivative , evaluate many study impressive immunomodulatory effect cancer , MS autoimmune disorder .</detailed_description>
