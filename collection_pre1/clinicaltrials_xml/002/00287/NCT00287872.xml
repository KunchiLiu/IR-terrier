	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Thalidomide may stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . Giving bortezomib together thalidomide may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together thalidomide work treat patient newly diagnose stage II stage III multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Thalidomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II Stage III Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor efficacy bortezomib thalidomide patient newly diagnose stage II III multiple myeloma . - Determine incidence severity peripheral motor/sensory neuropathy patient treat regimen . - Assess ability mobilize collect stem cell patient undergo future autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation . - Determine time response patient treat regimen . - Assess quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 oral thalidomide daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 4 course . Patients plan undergo transplantation AND achieve ≥ 50 % reduction tumor burden proceed transplantation study . Patients undergo transplantation receive 2 additional course therapy beyond best response 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve least partial response completion treatment may receive maintenance therapy comprise bortezomib IV every 2 month oral thalidomide* daily OR twice every 2 month ( i.e. , day day bortezomib administration ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *For patient previously discontinue thalidomide , maintenance therapy may consist bortezomib . Quality life assess baseline , begin study course , completion study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
