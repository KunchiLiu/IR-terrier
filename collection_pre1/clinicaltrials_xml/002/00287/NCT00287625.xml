	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) disease state characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . Acute exacerbation COPD ( AECOPD ) increase symptom like dyspnea , cough sputum natural history disease incur significant burden health care system . In Hong Kong , COPD 5th lead cause death , account least 4 % public hospital acute admission 2003 . Previous study show pulmonary function quality life adversely affect frequent exacerbation . Strategies decrease heavy use health care resource urgently need benefit patient society . Pulmonary rehabilitation programme ( PRP ) multidisciplinary programme care patient chronic respiratory impairment . In COPD patient , programme tailor individually optimize patient 's physical social performance autonomy . Previous study patient stable COPD find PRP include education physical training could lead statistically significant clinically meaningful improvement health relate quality life exercise capacity . COPD patient experience episode acute exacerbation high risk develop another attack . There one randomized control study look effect out-patient PRP patient immediately exacerbation . It show PRP immediately exacerbation safe improve exercise capacity quality life 3 month . However , follow duration study short thus effect rehabilitation recurrent exacerbation hospitalization assess information important . The investigator would thus like perform randomize control trial ass short course ( 6 week ) out-patient PRP patient admit acute hospital AECOPD could positive impact patient decrease health care resource utilization ( recurrent COPD exacerbation , hospitalization accident emergency department [ AED ] attendance ) improve quality life patient period 1 year . Patients randomize either control group PRP intervention group . It hope information generate study able give guide whether short course PRP effective patient ( term quality life ) health care system ( term health care utilization ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients admit AECOPD recruit study . AECOPD define patient background COPD least two major symptom ( increased dyspnoea , increase sputum purulence , increase sputum amount ) one major one minor symptom ( nasal discharge/congestion , wheeze , sore throat , cough ) least two consecutive days.5,17 Inclusion criterion include patient ambulatory ( major joint problem Class III IV angina ) , patient agree join exercise programme offer , forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) &lt; 70 % predict normal age 40 year old . Patients PRP within past 1 year recruit study . The subject randomize 2 group : 1 . Usual care group ( Control ) 2 . PRP group A random number generator use assign whether patient control PRP group . The computer programme help randomize subject equal opportunity either group take account 5 factor : age ( &lt; 70 year ≥ 70 year ) , sex , length hospital admission ( &lt; 7 day ≥ 7 day ) , 6 minute walk test ( &lt; 100 metre ≥ 100 metre ) , predict FEV1 ( &lt; 30 % ≥ 30 % ) . This method adapt study Man et al . After recruitment AECOPD admission , baseline assessment do 24 hour discharge hospital . Each subject follow every 3 month discharge 1 year . For intervention group , PRP start within 10 day discharge hospital . Patients intervention group attend rehabilitation unit physiotherapy department 3 half day per week 6 week . In first visit , patient see nurse specialist offer smoke cessation counsel inhaler technique reinforce . The nurse also offer psychosocial support patient . The exercise session perform 2 dedicated physiotherapist . Supervised exercise training include use treadmill , arm cycling , arm leg weight training provide intensity adjust physiotherapist base tolerability physiological variable ( oxygen saturation heart rate ) patient . Patients also advise perform home exercise . The physiotherapist also teach patient proper breathe technique cope daily activity . For control group , patient also see nurse specialist within 10 day discharge hospital PRP group . The patient offer smoke cessation advice inhaler technique reinforce PRP group . Both control PRP group follow every 3 month respiratory research clinic . The Standard medication ( include inhale corticosteroid appropriate accord GOLD guideline1 ) prescribe patient management COPD group . Both PRP group control group also see nurse specialist visit education disease counsel . Assessments perform monitor patient 's progress group : 1 . Lung function test ( pre post bronchodilator ) ( baseline , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month ) 2 . 6 min walk test ( baseline , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month ) 3 . Body mass index measurement ( baseline , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month ) 4 . Modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale ( MMRC ) ( baseline , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month ) 5 . St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) , medical outcome short form 36 questionnaire ( SF-36 ) chronic respiratory questionnaire ( baseline , 3 month , 12 month ) Exacerbations ( require treatment course oral steroid antibiotic ) , AED department visit hospitalization count . Patient phone contact check mortality patient return follow . Each patient ask give informed consent ethical committee approval obtain Joint The Chinese University Hong Kong - New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee .</detailed_description>
