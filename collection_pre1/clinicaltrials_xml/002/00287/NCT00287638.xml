	<brief_summary>Patients obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) repetitive episode partial complete upper airway obstruction sleep . This lead sleep fragmentation symptom like excessive daytime sleepiness impair psychosocial well-being . More evidence suggest OSA associate cardiovascular disease like hypertension , myocardial infarction , pulmonary hypertension stroke . The upper airway structure function alter OSA . Some study suggest increase level systemic biomarkers inflammation oxidative stress patient OSA . So far , limited data non-invasive monitoring inflammation involve upper airway OSA patient . The inflammatory mechanism involve upper airway may give insight systemic effect , like cardiovascular complication , OSA . Measurement constituent exhale breath exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) non-invasive method ass degree inflammation airway . Exhaled nitric oxide ( eNO ) measure subject exhale mouthpiece connect machine measure real-time eNO level . With subject exhale cool unit , EBC collect liquid form result condensation . This study ass eNO exhale breath , oxidative stress marker ( 8-isoprostane ) cellular inflammatory marker ( eotaxin , monocyted derived chemokine , growth relate oncogene- alpha , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ) EBC blood OSA patient 1 night 3 month continuous positive airway pressure treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Markers Exhaled Breath Condensate Obstructive Sleep Apnoea ( OSA ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Measurement exhale Nitric Oxide collection exhale breath condensate peripheral blood . This do 2 4 time ( admission , morning sleep study , immediately CPAP titration , CPAP use 3 month ) . Each time eNO measure first , follow EBC collection . For test morning , patient ask postpone his/her breakfast test take less half hour . OSA define patient respiratory disturbance index â‰¥5/hr . Measurement Exhaled Nitric Oxide : eNO measure use Sievers 280i chemiluminescence analyser ( Sievers Instruments , Boulder , CO , USA ) sensitive NO 1 ppb 200 ppm resolution 1 ppb accuracy 1 ppb design online record . The eNO measurement perform accord ATS standard . Briefly , subject remain seat without nose clip procedure , 2-minute rest eNO measurement . The eNO measure online expiratory flow rate 50 ml/sec , dead space 10 ml 2-second plateau duration . Repeated exhalation perform three NO plateau value agree 10 % level two agree 5 % level . The mean NO value record . Collection Exhaled Breath Condensate : EBC collect use ECoscreen ( Jaeger , Germany ) accord manufacturer instruction . After rinse mouth , recruit subject breathe tidally mouthpiece connect unique one-way valve cool collection tube vapour , aerosol moisture breath condense along wall tube . The one-way valve use plunger collect droplet stick inside wall hold sample near top tube . The device inherently prevent salivary contamination show absence salivary amylase EBC . On average , device able collect 300 microL per minute EBC adult . Each subject ask breathe collection kit 5 minute , sufficiently long yield 1 ml condensate inflammatory marker analysis . EBC store immediately -70oC analysis inflammatory marker . Measurement 8 isoprostane , GRO alpha , MCP1 , eotaxin MDC level exhale breath condensate : EBC store -70oC analyse 8-isoprostane , GROalpha , MCP1 , eotaxin MDC level concentration batch . We use 96-well polystyrene microplates coat murine monoclonal antibody human 8 isoprostane , GRO alpha , MCP1 , eotaxin MDC level . The level marker EBC measure duplicate sandwich enzyme immunoassay ( R &amp; D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) accord instruction provide manufacturer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients recruit upon admission sleep study Division Respiratory Medicine , Prince Wales Hospital . Patients age 18 60 recruit . Known history respiratory disease affect inflammatory marker EBC like asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease bronchiectasis . Upper low respiratory tract infection within 6 week study . Current smoker , exsmoker quit less year . Pregnant subject . Any form malignancy serious medical illness affect survival subject significantly 1 year period .</criteria>
