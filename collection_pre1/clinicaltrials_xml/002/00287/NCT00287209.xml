	<brief_title>Reduction Atrial Fibrillation Study Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting . ( RASCABG 1 Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New-onset atrial fibrillation ( AF ) coronary bypass grafting ( CABG ) common , incidence range 5 % -65 % . Although postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmia often regard temporary problem relate operation therefore innocuous , complication clinically significant adverse effect patient outcome . The purpose study find good treatment without severe adverse effect minimize incidence AF maybe reduce hemodynamic stress AF well know cause . This would indicate risk develop fatal event like cerebral apoplexy , TCI , AMI death minimize result improve hemodynamic . Overall AF associate risk illness development severe complication cerebral apoplexy , TCI , AMI death factor 2-3 . There furthermore see twofold increase duration intensive care unit stay prolongation total hospitalization time attendant increase hospitalization cost . The outbreak AF CABG increase last twenty year . It speculate reason rise incidence due advance age patient population , complex cardiac surgery due former underestimation arrhythmia . Medical therapy include various drug , Î²-blockers , calcium channel blocker , digoxin , sotalol , quinidine , amiodarone among others , control heart rate restore sinus rhythm . Most antiarrhythmic agent significant cardiac noncardiac adverse effect , use drug minimize short period time . Amiodarone well know drug treat AF diminish incidence AF CABG operation . So far study focus postoperative high dos treatment oral administrate amiodarone . The study publicize study drug administrate intravenously pre- , post- pre- postoperative . Some study orally administrate drug different regimes11 study yet show possible affect solitarily postoperative administrate high dos amiodarone intravenously administrate bolus , affect get load immediately .</detailed_description>
