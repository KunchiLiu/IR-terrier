	<brief_summary>Background : - Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) disease cancer cell find tissue skin mucous membrane line mouth , nose , anus . KS cause red purple patch ( lesion ) skin mucous membrane spread organ body , lung , liver , intestinal tract . - BAY 43-9006 inhibits activity several protein protein receptor cell think important progression KS . Blocking mechanism may cause KS get well . Objectives : - To learn toxicity blood level BAY 43-9006 people KS take anti-retroviral drug ritonavir . - To look evidence beneficial treatment effect BAY 43-9006 Eligibility : - Adults confirm KS , HIV-positive HIV-negative . - Patients must either 1 ) least five measurable KS lesion previous local therapy , 2 ) measurable non-skin disease permit evaluation response treatment . Design : - Patients randomly assign specific dose BAY 43-9006 . They take drug mouth either twice daily , depend dose group , 54 week . - Drug blood level determine patient take BAY 43-9006 1 2 week blood collection immediately dose 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 24 hour dose . - Patients evaluate every 3 week review medication diary , interview drug side effect , physical examination , assessment KS lesion . - KS lesion photograph enter study time point study . - CD4 cell count HIV viral load test every 12 week . - Biopsies do start study , day 15 , appear lesion resolve . - Other procedure , CT MRI scan , may do medically indicate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This study design test toxicity pharmacokinetics different dos BAY 43-9006 ( Sorafenib ) patient Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) . It also assess , preliminary manner , activity BAY 43-9006 disease effect biological marker . BAY 43-9006 potent inhibitor wild-type mutant c-Raf kinase isoforms . In addition , agent also inhibit p38 , c-kit , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) , VEGF-R3 , platelet derive growth factor receptor beta ( PDGFR-B ) . There evidence several receptor , especially VEGF-R2 , VEGF-R3 , PDGF-RB , important KS pathogenesis . The principle tumor cell KS lesion spindle cell , derive endothelial cell . Spindle cell proliferate response VEGF , VEGF-C ( ligand VEGF-R3 ) , PDGF , stimulation spindle cell factor appear important component pathogenesis KS . There also evidence c-kit important KS . Because BAY 43-9006 inhibit function receptor c-kit , may specific activity tumor . BAY 43-9006 metabolize least part CYP 3A4 , ritonavir , HIV protease inhibitor commonly use AIDS patient , inhibitor CYP 3A4 . Also , AIDS patient often quite sensitive drug toxicity . Thus , patient AIDS-KS ritonavir may particularly sensitive BAY 43-9006 . OBJECTIVES : To assess toxicity profile pharmacokinetics BAY 43-9006 oral dose regimens 200 mg daily , 200mg twice daily , 400 mg twice daily , toxic dose , patient HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) receive ritonavir . Also , assess preliminary manner pharmacokinetics toxicity profile BAY 43-9006 patient receive ritonavir . ELIGIBILITY : Key eligibility criterion follow : patient 18 year age old , without HIV infection , KS least 5 cutaneous lesion untreated local therapy ; patient HIV infection must KS progress stable highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) ; patient extensive active , visceral , symptomatic KS exclude . DESIGN : Patients AIDS-KS receive ritonavir administer BAY 43-9006 . An initial group patient administer 200 mg BAY 43-9006 daily , subsequent group receive 200 mg twice daily 400 mg twice daily respectively . Also two group patient KS ritonavir administer 200 mg 400 mg BAY 43-9006 twice daily respectively . Patients studied toxicity , pharmacokinetics , KS response , effect biological marker target receptor kinase phosphorylation signal molecule KS tissue . Other parameter assess include VEGF level , viral load KSHV , KS lesion blood flow non-invasive technique . If patient tolerate BAY 43-9006 , receive 24 week . If evidence stable KS tumor response , may receive drug 54 week total .</detailed_description>
