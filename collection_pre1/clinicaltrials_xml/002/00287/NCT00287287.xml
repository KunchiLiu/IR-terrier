	<brief_title>REVLIMID® ( Lenalidomide ) Therapy Radioiodine-Unresponsive Papillary Follicular Thyroid Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thalidomide find new us tumor anti-angiogenesis agent capable diminish proliferation angiogenesis-dependent solid malignancy . Distantly metastatic , unresectable medullary thyroid carcinoma , well de-differentiated papillary follicular thyroid carcinoma , long concentrate radioiodine , know effective systemic therapy . We verify , context complete phase 2 clinical trial , thalidomide significant activity thyroid carcinoma long radioiodine avid rapidly progressive . This activity limit durability around 7 month associate significant toxicity sedation , constipation neuropathy . REVLIMID® ( lenalidomide ) analog thalidomide chemical name , alpha- ( 3-aminophthalimido ) glutarimide . REVLIMID® note potent thalidomide inhibit production TNF-alpha . It double inhibition microvessel growth concentration thalidomide rat aorta angiogenesis model well greatly enhanced activity IMiD . Most importantly , lack much toxicity thalidomide , particularly regard somnolence , neuropathy , biochemical effect . In fact , patient multiple myeloma , know resistant thalidomide , still see exhibit clinical response REVLIMID® . This make REVLIMID® appropriate agent investigate phase 2 trial thyroid carcinoma .</detailed_description>

Use experimental drug therapy within 28 day baseline . Known hypersensitivity thalidomide . The development erythema nodosum , characterize desquamate rash , take thalidomide similar drug . Any condition , include presence laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk he/she participate study confounds ability interpret data study . Concurrent use anticancer agent treatment , exception thyrotropinsuppression levothyroxine . All subject central nervous system involvement , exception subject whose central nervous system metastases treat either radiotherapy and/or surgery remain asymptomatic evidence active central nervous system disease ( verify compute tomography [ CT ] scan magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) least 6 month .
