	<brief_summary>The principal objective study evaluate effectiveness widely use complementary medicine intervention , mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , mindfulness meditation yoga principal component treatment chronic , often fatal illness affect ten million Americans . The investigator propose conduct single center randomize control trial 150 patient assign either mindfulness meditation condition , disease education control condition , stress-monitoring usual care control condition . They test follow specific hypothesis : 1 . In comparison either control condition , significantly coronary artery disease ( CAD ) patient mindfulness meditation condition demonstrate reduction mental stress-induced ischemia . 2 . The ratio low-to-high frequency spectral power heart rate variability ambulatory monitor significantly decrease follow participation stress reduction program compare disease education usual care condition . 3 . Patients mindfulness meditation condition report great improvement quality life ( i.e. , reduction general psychological symptomology , anger , anxiety , depression , daily stress , along increase optimism stress cop efficacy ) patient either control condition . 4 . Day-to-day variability self-reported mental stress inversely relate day-to-day stress cop efficacy entire sample time spent mindfulness practice active treatment condition , relationship maintain 3-month follow-up . 5 . Patients CAD mental stress ischemia show *abnormal peripheral artery response baseline study show significant improvement mindfulness intervention . - Abnormal response define peripheral arterial tonometry ( PAT ) tracing decrease great 20 % amplitude mental stress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Acute chronic psychological stress show risk factor cardiac event . More recently advent new technology allow cardiac imaging , acute psychological stressor show produce myocardial ischemia certain subset patient CAD . Several study show production myocardial ischemia response acute psychological stress laboratory marker adverse event patient CAD . Several pathway psychologically induced stress may trigger ischemic event propose , number study provide evidence stress affect ischemic event via pathway . Stress intervention show positive impact CAD outcomes , one thus far test effect ischemic event . Furthermore , study report positive result coronary risk factor use meditation yoga . Current clinical meditation literature suggest mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction program ( i.e. , multicomponent , psychoeducational program base mindfulness meditation cultivate ability pay attention one 's moment-to-moment experience nonjudgmental , nonreactive fashion ) able reduce stress reactivity CAD patient . It predict reduction stress reactivity result reduce radionuclide image perfusion defect laboratory mental stress task . Although used heart patient , demonstrate good result stress symptomology general medical population . We believe similar result see CAD patient effect act follow pathway : 1 ) decrease sympathetic tone 2 ) increase parasympathetic tone . The overall goal propose study evaluate efficacy meditation-based stress reduction program reduction mental stress-induced ischemia . DESIGN NARRATIVE : To test efficacy MBSR , patient randomly assign one three group . The MBSR condition provide training mindfulness meditation method . The patient education control group provide information CAD didactic format . This condition control nonspecific effect contact therapeutic setting . Excluding interval spend personal meditation practice mindfulness meditation condition , length session two intervention condition approximately equal . The third group , stress-monitoring usual care control condition , control effect symptom measurement reactivity patient receive routine medical care .</detailed_description>
