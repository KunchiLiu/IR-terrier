	<brief_summary>Latanoprost commonly use treatment glaucoma . Because mechanism action , plausible age patient use medication may affect efficacy time onset . We go study effectiveness Latanoprost people different age , see change base age patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Age Latanoprost 0.005 % Patients With Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Latanoprost topical ocular hypotensive medication well establish safety efficacy profile . Its effect mediate increase uveoscleral outflow , due enzymatic degradation extracellular matrix within ciliary muscle . Since amount extracellular matrix within human eye increase age , uveoscleral outflow decrease age , would expect difference efficacy latanoprost patient different age . This demonstrated study assess overall effect latanoprost across adult age group use multivariate analysis . ( Camras CB et al , 1996 ) . However , difference timing onset drug effect may get overlooked clinical study clinical practice well , patient tend see two eight week initiation treatment , time difference response time may already occur leveled . To knowledge , study specifically look time onset drug effect latanoprost different age group . Because theoretical plausibility effect base mechanism action latanoprost , represent opportunity elucidate characteristic medication manner clinical scientific relevance . Our aim thus determine difference timing onset ocular hypotensive effect latanoprost glaucoma patient different age group .</detailed_description>
