	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) perform 300,000 time year United States , often osteoarthritis ( OA ) . While pain predictably reduce , function typically ever reach age-matched , uninjured subject . Quadriceps weakness implicate development progression knee OA significant problem TKA . Voluntary exercise ineffective restore quadriceps strength TKA . The aim study : 1 ) ass effectiveness high-level neuromuscular electrical stimulation adjunct ongoing intensive , early rehabilitation restore quadriceps strength improve functional outcome primary TKA , 2 ) identify physiological morphological base improvement quadriceps strength functional outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Reduced muscle strength illness injury often lead loss function independence elderly . The recovery muscle strength function disable elderly individual major challenge rehabilitation . The etiology muscle weakness injury age fully elucidate . Training program design maximize strength gain young individual may optimal elderly cause weakness morphology muscle may different young vs. old people . The overall goal work determine physiologically morphologically base rehabilitation program effective traditional rehabilitation counter change muscle strength function old individual . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) may use improve strength function follow injury surgery . This study provide motivation explore use NMES elderly . We posit use NMES augment traditional rehabilitation program elderly patient osteoarthritis follow total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) result great strength functional gain use traditional rehabilitation . Elderly patient osteoarthritis undergo TKAs serve ideal subject test effectiveness rehabilitation program become patient almost always exhibit marked quadriceps weakness resistant traditional physical rehabilitation . More 300,000 TKAs perform year United States treat osteoarthritis knee old individual . So , successful rehabilitation elder patient follow TKA important challenging problem . The specific aim proposal : 1 ) To assess effectiveness high-level neuromuscular electrical stimulation adjunct ongoing intensive , early rehabilitation restore quadriceps strength improve functional outcome primary TKA , 2 ) To identify physiological morphological base improvement quadriceps strength functional outcome A total 200 subject participate study . Functional strength test provide information patient ’ clinical treatment allow u monitor progress . This information also help design train program individual follow total knee replacement optimize return full level function surgery . MRI screen provide information regard size thigh muscle various period throughout rehabilitation . It enable u assess impact post-operative treatment increase size thigh muscle . Patients ask participate functional strength test session , last 1½ hour , follow time : 0-2 week surgery , 3-4 week , 6-7 week , 10-12 week , 6 month , 1 year , 2 year surgery . MRI test last 30 minute per session perform 0-2 week surgery , 3-4 week , 10-12 week , 1 year surgery . Functional test include 5 part : time walk test , time stair climb test , time balance test , time step test , six-minute walk test . A strength test use assess strength thigh muscle . The second part study involve treatment . Patients participate 6 week physical therapy , 3 time per week . They randomly assign one 2 group . One group participate traditional rehabilitation program . The group receive electrical stimulation strengthen thigh muscle addition traditional rehabilitation program .</detailed_description>
