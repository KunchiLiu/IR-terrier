	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) major complication allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transplantation . Acute GVHD produce significant morbidity complicate patient management result organ toxicity , frequent infection , malnutrition , substantial delay recovery transplantation . Corticosteroids primary therapy acute GVHD three decade . Various additional immunosuppressive strategy test GVHD therapy neither anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , CD5-immunotoxins , IL-1 antagonists agent demonstrably helpful either control GVHD symptom improvement survival . Published response rate complete response ( CR ) acute GVHD therapy corticosteroid range 25-41 % . These rate use benchmark assess efficacy promise new agent . New immunosuppressive agent strategy require improve management GVHD decrease toxicity immunosuppressive regimen . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In trial , patient newly diagnose acute GVHD randomly assign receive corticosteroid plus one four new agent ( etanercept , MMF , denileukin diftitox [ Ontak ] , pentostatin ) . A control arm corticosteroid employ . Each agent assess safety efficacy ( least 35 % complete remission [ CR ] rate Day 28 therapy expect previously untreated patient ) .</detailed_description>
