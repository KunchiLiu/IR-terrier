	<brief_summary>The chemokine CXCL8 play key role recruitment activation polymorphonuclear neutrophils post-ischemia reperfusion injury solid organ transplantation . Repertaxin novel , specific inhibitor CXCL8 . This study configure explore safety efficacy repertaxin prevent primary graft dysfunction ( PGD ) lung transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung transplantation become standard therapy patient end-stage lung disease . Within last decade , donor management , organ preservation , immunosuppressive regimen control infectious complication substantially improve . In addition , operative technique transplantation procedure develop international standard high quality . However , despite refinement , significant reperfusion injury occur 10-20 % lung transplant recipient consequence unavoidable process procurement , preservation restore blood flow . This clinical condition , recently term primary graft dysfunction ( PGD ) , remain important problem lung transplantation , still represent single big cause early morbidity mortality lung recipient . In addition , evidence suggest relationship reperfusion injury , acute rejection , subsequent development chronic graft dysfunction . In post-ischemia reperfusion , restoration blood supply ( reperfusion ) prolong tissue ischemia associate inflammatory reaction characterize massive polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration reperfused tissue . The infiltrate inflammatory cell perpetuate initial inflammatory reaction induce injury . The importance CXCL8 lung tissue ischemic time reperfusion clearly demonstrate . The current standard care prevent clinical condition focus prevention way surgical technique procurement , storage implantation graft lung . The efficacy repertaxin prevent polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration tissue damage rat model kidney transplantation lung transplantation , well safety show human phase 1 study , provide rationale clinical study aim evaluate effect repertaxin prevent PGD lung transplantation .</detailed_description>
