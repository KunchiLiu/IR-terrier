	<brief_summary>The specific goal project ( 1 ) refine Home Automated Telemanagement ( HAT ) program accord JNC 7 Report base focus group review conduct key personnel , primary care provider , patient fully implement multidisciplinary model hypertension telemanagement African Americans adjunct ambulatory care ( 2 ) evaluate randomize clinical trial impact HAT hypertension care delivery patient ' clinical outcome use clinic- patient-level variable . The comparison make standard hypertension care recommend JNC 7 Report . The following primary hypothesis relate clinic-level outcome test : Use HAT associate ( 1 ) improve proportion treat patient achieve blood pressure goal meet JNC 7 recommendation , ( 2 ) significant reduction systolic diastolic blood pressure . Researchers also explore impact HAT physician awareness use hypertension treatment guideline promulgate JNC 7 Report . The following secondary exploratory hypothesis relate patient-level outcome evaluate : The HAT program positive impact behavioral cognitive factor play important role process patient self-management , include hypertension treatment self-efficacy , health locus control , health belief , hypertension knowledge . Researchers also investigate impact HAT patient ' compliance multi-component treatment plan ( include adherence medication regimens therapeutic lifestyle change ) explore effect HAT system patient ' ability reach dietary , physical activity , weight control , sodium consumption goal recommend JNC 7 Report . During study researcher explore impact HAT patient satisfaction medical care , health-related quality life , health service utilization . Researchers also assess acceptance HAT system patient provider . Finally , researcher perform cost-effectiveness analysis use HAT system hypertension control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recent study demonstrate successful chronic disease management require coordinated effort include health care provider follow recent clinical guideline everyday practice , educate patient adherent prescribe treatment plan , comprehensive patient-provider communication . Studies employ telecommunication technology successful affect major component chronic disease care , include physician practice pattern , patient adherence therapy , patient-provider communication . These study focus mainly improvement single component clinical care process . To date study evaluate coordinated approach concurrently employ component integrated framework link primary care . In study researcher propose evaluate multi-component telemanagement system provide integrated support clinician patient implement hypertension treatment guideline accord JNC 7 Report . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Researchers use HAT system test platform intervention . The HAT system develop facilitate implementation current clinical guideline provide integrated , multi-component chronic disease management intervention . HAT design Internet-based telemedicine system ( 1 ) provide ongoing education patient chronic disease , ( 2 ) help patient follow self-care plan , ( 3 ) help health care practitioner treat monitor patient ' self-management process accord current clinical guideline . The HAT system consist ( 1 ) patient unit ( computer palmtop connect disease-specific testing device , blood pressure monitor ) , ( 2 ) HAT server analyze store self-testing result , ( 3 ) clinician unit use review patient result Web . During telecommunication session patient perform self-testing receive structure disease-specific education , patient-tailored counseling , advice follow individual self-care plan base current result self-testing . The information patient include text , audio , video component . In instance patient noncompliance self-testing , medication nonadherence , failure follow physician-prescribed treatment plan , system give feedback patient motivate well compliance alert patient 's physician and/or nurse may contact patient well . This design easily adapt chronic condition utilize appropriate disease-specific test device reprogramming decision support logic accord particular disease management guideline . In previous study researcher demonstrate ( 1 ) high level acceptance HAT system patient low-income , inner-city area without previous computer experience , ( 2 ) acceptance system physicians nurse take care patient , ( 3 ) validity self-testing result adult patient use HAT . The system currently use evaluate efficacy home telemanagement patient asthma NIH- ALA-funded study . In proposed study , researcher seek advance understanding applicability utility HAT technology focus impact African Americans hypertension .</detailed_description>
