	<detailed_description>ANTECEDENTS : We show experimentally significant adjuvant effect quinacrine ( analog chloroquine ) culture malignant glial cell C6 implant malignant glioma Wistar rat . When quinacrine add standard therapy carmustine cell destruction tumor diminution high therapy carmustine alone . Those result publish Neurosurgery 2001 ; 49:969-973 ( time manuscript `` press '' ) . The present protocol start control , open-label clinical trial 7 patient GBM 7 contemporary control patient . All patient receive treatment extensive surgery , carmustine therapy irradiation standard dos ( describe previous report Surgical Neurology 2000 ; 53:157-162 ) . Once select enter study patient allocate alternatively chloroquine control group . Endpoint evaluation settle surviving time begin therapy end point follow-up settle survivor two year begin treatment . 18 month begin open trial observe chloroquine treat patient longer survival adverse effect chloroquine therapy see . At time decide start second part protocol design double-blind placebo-controlled trial , ideal number patient include settled 15 patient group . The result 1st . phase study open-label trial publish Neurosurgical Focus ( http : //www.aans.org/education/journal/neurosurgical/feb03/14-2-3.pdf ) February , 2003 . In order corroborate observation ( time short follow-up ) open trial double-blind , placebo-controlled study initiate October , 2000 ; dose chloroquine blind study decide maintain 150 mg daily one year begin therapy . The Research Committee notify begin design trial : 6,000 tablet chloroquine 150 mg ( Aralen ) 6,000 identical tablet placebo commercially purchase sent laboratory Dr. Roberto Medina National Polytechnic Institute ( select monitor ) . 30 set 375 tablet separate ( 15 contain chloroquine 15 placebo ) identical flask , assignment treatment randomly allocate ; codify treatment number 1-30 sent back Institute . The code seal keep monitor end study . Patients include study give correspond treatment sequential order . Criteria inclusion patient trial detailed method manuscript submit Annals Internal Medicine Ms. # M0-1087 ( page 6-7 ) . Follow-up statistical analysis : End-point evaluation settle time death begin therapy . Follow-up survivor settle 2 year begin treatment . Survival distribution analyze Kaplan-Meier plot compare log rank test . Statistical analysis demographic , clinical imaging characteristic patient make test independent value . After four year begin study 26 patient originally decide goal number 30 patient complete least two year follow-up . At time ( January 2005 ) decide open code proceed analysis patient , turn 13 chloroquine-treated 13 placebo-treated patient . The last 4 patient ( included analysis ) currently treatment follow-up end next year ( 2 patient receive chloroquine 2 placebo ) . No patient initially select refuse enter study , patient include lose follow-up . All 26 patient include study follow time death July 2005 survivor .</detailed_description>
