	<brief_summary>Capsule endoscopy ( CE ) safe effective tool assessment obscure gastrointestinal bleeding ( OGIB ) . However , real efficacy position diagnostic algorithm OGIB vs. push enteroscopy ( PE ) remain unknown since previous study technique perform include patient The purpose protocol conduct randomize prospective control trial patient OGIB compare strategy base CE PE follow alternative exploration first line exploration negative . The main outpoint study concern diagnostic yield two exploration . Second endpoint concern clinical relevance two strategy test ( CE ± PE vs. CE ± PE ) term diagnostic yield , clinical outcome , therapeutic impact add exploration</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective randomize multicentric study . After screen visit , eligible subject randomly assign explore CE PE ( first line exploration ) . The alternative exploration perform diagnosis evidence examination assign randomization . An independent staff member assign subject 1:1 ratio CE PE strategies stratification overt occult bleeding center accord consecutive number keep serialize sealed opaque envelope . After completion exploration , patient return month 3 , 6 12 thereafter . At visit , clinical evaluation laboratory test perform patient manage accord publish recommendations2 ( AGA medical position ) . The first line exploration well alternative exploration could do one year follow-up period case severe relapse OGIB necessity perform biopsy therapeutic procedure .</detailed_description>
