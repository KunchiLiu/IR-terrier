	<detailed_description>Patients undergo general medical evaluation pulmonary physician ( consultant appropriate organ ) . The typical routine medical study carry may include : chest X-ray ( posterior-anterior lateral ) , non-contrast high resolution CT scan chest , pulmonary function test , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , general hematologic study , general serologic study , /immunologic study , biochemical analysis ( include carboxyhemoglobin measure blood carbon monoxide level order accurately evaluate diffusion capacity individual smoke since smoking increase blood level carbon monoxide ) , alcohol blood test , urinalysis , urine chemistry ( include blood urine nicotine cotinine test evaluate urine active passive exposure nicotine ) , blood urine drug screening ( evaluate use recreational drug and/or mood altering medication ) , pregnancy test ( applicable ) HIV serology . Also , sweat chloride sweat rate test may perform physician evaluate participant possible diagnosis cystic fibrosis . The study individual undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy combination bronchial brushing and/or bronchoalveolar lavage and/or bronchial wall biopsy . The primary factor determine individual bronchial alveolar lavage ( BAL ) and/or brushing and/or biopsy particular lung disease affect individual . This depend know mechanism relevant pathogenesis particular disease . For example , individual asthma , sample may include airway brush airway biopsy ; contrast , individual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , sample may include airway brushing , airway biopsy , bronchoalveolar lavage . Other determine factor include : amount moderate sedation ( use ) amount analgesia use ; maximal dosage topical lidocaine allow per procedure ; allergic reaction medication use procedure ; individual 's tolerance procedure .</detailed_description>
