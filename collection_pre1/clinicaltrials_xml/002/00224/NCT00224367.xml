	<brief_summary>Hip fracture significant problem healthcare provider due increase incidence fracture age population . Hip fracture frequent fracture people 80 year age second frequent 65 year . It project 2051 , 23 % Australian population old 65 number hip fracture rise fourfold ( 17,000 2004 , 60,000 2051 ) . Evidence-based clinical practice guideline regard management hip fracture publish Medical Journal Australia 1999 updated 2003 . Seventeen aspect treatment systematically review , include mobilisation surgery . Early assisted ambulation within 48 hour post surgery recommend ( Chilov 2003 p 490 ) . However , recommendation base observational ( level 3 ) evidence . Early mobilization post surgery resource intensive . Early mobilization challenge uncomfortable patient require assistance one sometimes two , physiotherapist available seven day per week . Benefits must rigorously evaluate justify recommendation . We undertake randomize controlled trial effect two different ‘ time first ambulation ’ interval hip fracture surgery patient hospital outcomes.Our hypothesis early mobilisation would accelerate functional recovery hip fracture surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods Inclusions : Consecutive patient admit via emergency department The Alfred hospital Melbourne , surgical fixation acute fracture hip ( compression screw plate hemiarthroplasty ) . Exclusions : fracture pathological , postoperative order non-weight bearing operate hip , patient admit nursing home patient non-ambulant pre-morbidly . Sixty eligible patient randomly allocate , use computer generate program , one two group . Management All patient receive routine , standard post-operative medical nursing clinical care , currently practice The Alfred . All patient transfer sit bed early possible surgery . Ambulation The physiotherapy ambulation re-education program implement per day 7 day participant . The time first walk differ group . Data collection On admission : gender , age , preoperative mobility , social support , mental ability medical comorbidity , pre-existing medical comorbidity ( cardiac , respiratory , neurological , diabetes ) mental ability . Additional data patient medical record include : type surgical fixation ( nail/screw plate , hemi-arthroplasty ) , wait time surgery , time surgery complete , time first sit bed time first walk . Outcome measure The primary outcome measure patient ’ functional level , represent distance walk level assistance require transfer supine sit sit stand negotiate one step , day-7 post surgery . Secondary outcome measure include discharge destination length stay acute care ( day admission discharge The Alfred ) . Data analysis Statistical analysis perform use SAS version 8.2 . ( SAS Institute Inc. , Carv , NC , USA ) . Continuous variable compare use student t-tests validate use Wilcoxon rank sum test . Categorical variable compare use chi-square test equal proportion . A two-sided p-value 0.05 consider statistically significant . Sample size A difference group equivalent one standard deviation perceive clinical importance . With 30 subject per group , study 97 % power detect difference equal one standard deviation two-sided p-value 0.05 . A minimum 16 subject per subgroup require study 80 % power detect difference equal one standard deviation two-sided p-value 0.05 .</detailed_description>
