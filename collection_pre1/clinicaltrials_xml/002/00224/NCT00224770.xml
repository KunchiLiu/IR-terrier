	<brief_summary>The purpose trial determine safety use combination minimally invasive surgery clot lysis rt-PA remove intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) . The ICES arm trial determine safety endoscopic surgery remove ICH . All MISTIE intention treat subject represent hypothesize test group . The ICES cohort analyze separately .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose trial determine safety use combination minimally invasive surgery clot lysis rt-PA remove intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) . The procedure use image-based surgery ( MRI CT ) provide catheter access ICH intervention , one-time clot aspiration follow instillation rt-PA 72 hour . The Intraoperative stereotactic CT-guided Endoscopic Surgery ( ICES ) arm trial determine safety , feasibility effectiveness endoscopic surgery remove ICH . This test first step MISTIE surgical procedure endoscope , rigid cannula . We propose test intervention facilitate rapid complete recovery function decrease mortality condition compare conventional medical management without subject patient craniotomy . The specific objective trial test safety intervention assess ability remove blood clot brain tissue .</detailed_description>
