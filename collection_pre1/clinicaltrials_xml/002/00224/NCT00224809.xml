	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Functional MR common complication ischemic heart disease . Two large study confirm adverse effect functional MR survival heart attack . However , study heart failure ( HF ) small mainly limited patient non-ischemic cardiomyopathy . Recent animal study challenge traditional concept functional MR consequence mitral annular dilation , instead suggest functional MR due leaflet tether outward expansion leave ventricular wall ( LV remodel ) . This critical implication regard correct surgical approach correct functional MR. To date , large prospective study examine mechanism ( ) functional MR ischemic cardiomyopathy , interaction mechanism prognosis explore . This crucial knowledge gap : 1 ) 70 % HF case cause ischemic heart disease ; 2 ) functional MR occur around 60 % patient ischemic cardiomyopathy . This study aim fill gap define mechanism ( ) functional MR TEE large clinical trial patient ischemic cardiomyopathy participate STICH study . The STICH study address follow two key hypothesis therapeutic strategy management patient symptomatic HF , LV dysfunction , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) amenable CABG : 1 ) surgical coronary revascularization , addition aggressive medical HF management , long-term mortality , morbidity , quality life , cost benefit beyond aggressive medical management alone ; 2 ) early surgical ventricular shape restoration ( SVR ) combination CABG improve outcome compare coronary revascularization alone medical therapy alone . The study also address role LV size function , include myocardial viability predictor subsequent event 3 year . The STICH study affords unique opportunity specifically evaluate mechanism prognosis functional MR large group patient HF due ischemic cardiomyopathy . The study design STICH allow explore interaction mechanism functional MR , therapy , prognosis . For example , know whether patient functional MR adverse prognosis whether prognosis relate specific mechanism severity . In patient undergo CABG , know patient functional MR require valve repair one well without . It also know whether SVR reduces MR severity medical therapy mechanism . It possible improvement functional MR consequence reverse LV remodeling , know related myocardial viability , independent specific therapy . These important question address TEE STICH study , ancillary study STICH study . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The follow four specific aim test . Specific Aim 1 : This study define mechanism functional MR ischemic cardiomyopathy . Null Hypothesis : There difference measurement mitral valve apparatus know associated functional MR ischemic cardiomyopathy among patient different degree functional MR. To test hypothesis , study compare measurement annulus size leaflet tether three group patient , without MR , mild MR ( effective regurgitant orifice area [ EROA ] le 0.2 cm² ) , least moderate MR ( EROA le 0.2 cm² ) . The six specific measurement MR mechanism include follow : 1 ) diastolic mitral annulus area ; 2 ) percent systolic annular contraction ; 3 ) leaflet tent area ; 4 ) papillary muscle tether distance ; 5 ) papillary muscle separation distance ; 6 ) primary chordal separation angle . Specific Aim 2 : This study define effect therapy mechanism severity functional MR. Null Hypothesis : There difference measurement mechanism severity moderate functional MR treatment three treatment group ( medicine , CABG , CABG plus SVR ) . To test hypothesis , study compare change measurement MR mechanism ( see list ) severity ( EROA volume chest wall [ VCW ] ) 2-year follow-up three treatment group . The primary endpoint analysis long-term survival . Specific Aim 3 : This study evaluate effect functional MR prognosis . Null Hypothesis : The presence severity functional MR predict follow : 1 ) long-term survival ; 2 ) combine endpoint death , cardiac transplantation , automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( AICD ) countershock , hospitalization due heart failure , subsequent mitral valve repair replacement . Specific Aim 4 : This study evaluate effect myocardial viability mechanism functional MR. Null Hypothesis : The mechanism moderate MR different patient without myocardial viability single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) imaging . All patient undergone SPECT image do part parent study study . The grouping variable presence absence myocardial viability determine SPECT core lab .</detailed_description>
