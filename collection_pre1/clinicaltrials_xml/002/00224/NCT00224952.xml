	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine individual metabolic profile pediatric patient receive carbamazepine valproate therapy , attempt determine identity reactive metabolite , alternatively , identity metabolites serve potential precursor reactive specie .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pathogenesis Adverse Drug Reactions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adverse drug reaction broadly define undesirable response associate therapeutic drug use . A simple clinically useful classification divide adverse event dose-dependent largely predictable know pharmacologic property compound question , dependent characteristic unique susceptible individual , idiosyncratic nature . The long term objective research characterize mechanism responsible pathogenesis idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction child , particularly involve carbamazepine aromatic anticonvulsant . The study divide two phase . Phase 1 study involve collect urine 50 patient take CBZ therapeutically . Participants ask provide spot urine sample routine health visit . The urine analyze presence CBZ metabolites . In Phase 2 study , urine collect patient take either CBZ VPA therapeutically . If blood sample draw patient medical purpose relate study residual blood sample recover discard use genotyping analysis . Participants ask provide urine sample cover one complete dose interval CBZ VPA ( preferably overnight ) . Patients also follow longitudinally , urine collection clinic visit least two year period .</detailed_description>
