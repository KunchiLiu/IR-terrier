	<brief_summary>This study address challenge associate implementation clinical practice guideline ( CPG 's ) motivate interest gaining insight regard follow general research question CPG implementation : A . Can physician adherence complex CPGs promote use hand-held computerized decision support tool provide patient-specific recommendation , documentation , drug dose assistance ? B . Will increase adherence CPGs reduce variation management age , gender race/ethnicity disparity healthcare reduce eliminate ? C. What cost implication use PDA-based technology promote CPG adherence ? This randomized , control , unblinded , practice-based trial address research question test follow hypothesis 2 year behavioral intervention period : 1 . The absolute proportion patient treat appropriately respect lipid-lowering drug therapy within 4 month test increased net least 9 % intervention measure baseline follow-up independent cross-sectional sample eligible patient ( primary endpoint ) . 2 . The absolute proportion patient treat appropriate low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) goal follow-up baseline cohort eligible patient increase net least 12 % intervention ( secondary endpoint ) . 3 . The proportion eligible patient appropriately screen , risk-stratified , counsel regard therapeutic lifestyle change increase intervention ( tertiary endpoint ) . 4 . The intervention effect subgroup define disease status ( CVD , diabetes neither ) , age , gender , race/ethnicity reduces disparities observe baseline ( exploratory analysis ) . 5 . In addition , estimate marginal cost effectiveness intervention primary endpoint . The aim modify Year 1 include attention control group enable evaluate test impact strategy improve adherence recently release JNC 7 guideline test follow hypothesis : 1 . The absolute proportion patient treat appropriately respect blood pressure lower drug therapy 10 % great intervention practice comparison practice measure follow-up independent cross-sectional sample eligible patient ( primary endpoint ) . 2 . The absolute proportion patient treat appropriate blood pressure goal follow-up 10 % great intervention practice ( secondary endpoint ) . 3 . The intervention effect subgroup define disease status ( CVD , diabetes neither ) , age , gender , race/ethnicity reduces disparities observe baseline ( exploratory analysis ) . 4 .

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Many investigator identify `` gap '' quality care deliver routine practice U.S . According Institute Medicine ( IOM ) report `` Crossing Quality Chasm : A New Health System 21st Century , '' `` gap '' evidence practice might better term `` chasm '' . High blood cholesterol identify one 15 high priority condition Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) initial focus . In addition , report stress importance increase use information technology support clinical administrative process . Six major aim spell IOM report `` health care safe , effective , patient-centered , timely , efficient equitable . '' We develop intervention ground philosophy . Specifically , focus guideline promotes timely use safe effective intervention patient-tailored manner . A hand-held computerized decision support tool core component intervention support consistent efficient medical decision-making . Although goal improve overall adherence choose guideline , expect quality improvement process result increase equity , reflect reduced disparity respect appropriate treatment patient subgroup define gender , race/ethnicity , age . DESIGN NARRATIVE : GLAD Heart randomize trial . The study intervention ( academic detail ATPIII hand-held computerized decision support tool provide patient-specific , ATPIII-based risk stratification treatment recommendation cholesterol management ) attention control intervention ( academic detail JNC7 automate blood pressure device ) deliver level randomization practice . All practice ( N=64 ) receive usual care , consist guideline dissemination , baseline performance feedback , continue education , patient education material . Outcomes assess base patient level data chart review ( N 20,000 ) adult patient eligible cholesterol measurement . To assess ATPIII-related outcome , compare change baseline follow-up chart abstraction two arm . To assess JNC7-related outcome , compare difference follow-up chart abstraction two arm . Appropriate analytic method use analyze correlate data . Impact evaluation arm conduct via baseline follow-up survey participate provider . Process evaluation conduct track use PDA-based tool monitoring appropriate use automate blood pressure device . Other track information collect ensure intervention data collection success .</detailed_description>
