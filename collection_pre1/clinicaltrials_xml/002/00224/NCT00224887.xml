	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease account 40.6 % death United States 1998 . Although CVD manifest adulthood , risk factor CVD , obesity , may develop childhood persist adulthood . We propose test efficacy intervention design prevent obesity low-income , Mexican American child . Mexican-American child obese minority group U.S. population , fast grow minority group U.S.A. Poor dietary practice , especially food habit acquire family acculturate American food supply , think associate child 's excess weight gain . We propose conduct randomize clinical trial 150 family receive family-based behavioral counseling ( FBC ) sessions 150 family receive active placebo control intervention . Mothers second third grade child sixteen low-wealth elementary school randomize either treatment control intervention . The purpose FBC session change child 's food environment .

Two intervention strategy , video , `` What 's Eat ? '' develop population photograph family 's food practice , take family member , use counseling session . The control intervention consist group session use curriculum adapts standard nutrition recommendation traditional Mexican-American food . Community health advisor conduct FBC control session . The primary outcome trial child 's BMI . The secondary outcome household food supply . We hypothesize within one year timeframe , child 's whose mother expose FBC low BMI 's compare child whose mother receive active placebo control intervention . The mechanism intend change weight status alter type food available child home . Therefore , two household food inventory , one collect prior one family 's payday use secondary outcome . In addition , mother ' report household food security level , food purchase motif , family food interaction collect covariates . Measurements collect within one month complete intervention six month one year follow-up . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Family Based Counseling .

Primary Outcome Measure - Children 's Weight Status Height &amp; Weight : Standing height measure twice , near millimeter , use portable direct reading stadiometer . If two measure differ 5 mm , third measure obtain . Body weight measure twice , near 0.1 kg , use digital scale subject wear light indoor clothing without shoe . If two measure differ 0.2 kg , third measure obtain . The mean two measure , median three measure , use calculate BMI . Secondary Outcome Variable Our intervention design prevent obesity child change food environment . Therefore , secondary outcome research change type food available child home . Specifically , , quantitative household food inventory ass actual amount fruit , vegetable , high fat food total food energy collect . Inventories collect within three day grocery shop . Two train research assistant conduct inventory , require approximately 15 60 minute complete . All food except spice , hot sauce , bake powder , bake soda , coffee , tea spoil food collect inventory . The amount list label package , can , frozen food record , open , proportion remain package record . The amount meat cheese record pound base package label .
