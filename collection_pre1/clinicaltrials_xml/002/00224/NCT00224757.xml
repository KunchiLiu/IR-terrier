	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) independent risk factor stroke . Therapy vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) aspirin reduces risk thromboembolism ( TE ) dramatically . Risk stratification nowadays base clinical characteristic . However , many high risk AF patient may actually low risk , identify trans-oesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) . HYPOTHESIS A comprehensive strategy TEE base aspirin treatment AF patient eligible VKA therapy safe feasible . OBJECTIVES 1 . To show TEE base aspirin treatment safe compare VKA therapy . 2 . To test feasibility TEE tool detect four echocardiographic feature high stroke risk . METHODS In multi centre pilot study perform TEE patient AF eligible VKA treatment . TTE use pre-screening : TTE show leave atrial abnormality aortic plaque , patient exclude randomisation . TEE perform patient detect exclude complex aorta plaque sign leave atrial stasis . Three hundred patient feature TTE randomly assign treatment aspirin VKA . Follow-up 1 year . EXPECTED RESULTS Application new echo-guided antithrombotic strategy propose herein feasible may help reduce bleed whilst stroke prevention maintain . If low limit 95 % confidence interval yearly incidence primary endpoint aspirin remain 4.4 % large multi centre randomise control trial performed .</detailed_description>
