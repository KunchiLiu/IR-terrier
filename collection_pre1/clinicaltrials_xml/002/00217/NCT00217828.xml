	<brief_title>Effects Citalopram Hostility CHD Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hostility , broad personality dimension comprise behavioral tendency , cognitive bias emotional motivational characteristic appear play important role development coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Furthermore , hostility apparently important , function direct relationship disease development , virtue well document link wide range risk factor , include life style factor ( e.g. , tobacco alcohol use , imprudent diet ) , cardiovascular reactivity stressful circumstance , physiological index ( e.g. , reactivity acute stress , lipid level , platelet activity , glucose regulation ) . It hypothesize common pathway underlying factor describe serotonin system ( dy ) regulation central serotonin pathway . Indeed , study 1 2 program project application devote elaboration pathway underlying behavioral , psychological , physiological metabolic contributor development CHD . The focus project impact short treatment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) hostility wide range associate risk factor CHD . Should study prove successful , potential significantly impact treatment approach aim reduce risk development progression CHD . The study one four subprojects within Program Project Grant entitle `` Biobehavioral Studies Cardiovascular Disease '' . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This randomize placebo-controlled clinical trial select population , core question revolve around impact brief ( 11 week ) treatment citalopram , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) hostility measure number way . Healthy individual score median standard measure hostility identify . While questionnaire measure use screen select individual , host measure hostility employ fully capture wide ranging aspect `` personality '' dimension , thereby well ascertain impact active agent . In addition measurement central personality dimension interest , wide range factor measure . Life style risk factor measure include ( e.g. , use salivary cotinine ass validity participant ' self-report regard tobacco use , use unannounced 24 hour dietary recall , use pedometer assess physical activity ) , autonomic activity ( e.g. , wide range index available use impedance cardiography , use heart rate variability , baroreceptor sensitivity ) , platelet activity .</detailed_description>
