	<brief_title>Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure Reduction High-Risk Preteens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Parent counseling reduce child 's ETS exposure previous study . This study determine intervention direct preteen alone reduce ETS exposure . The original pilot study show counsel reduce preteen 's ETS exposure . New analysis show counsel reduce exposure preteens NIH asthma study . A third pilot study show counsel plus feedback incentive reduce preteen ' ETS exposure . Based result , number counseling session decrease 10 , inclusion criterion liberalize , recruitment source add assure feasibility . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study determine effect combine counseling , feedback , incentives reduce second hand smoke ( SHS ) exposure susceptibility smoking among high-risk preteen . Two hundred youth age 8 13 year old , include African American , Latino , Anglo , racial/ethnic group , recruit . Preteens must nonsmoker expose ETS home . Youth recruit sequentially assign usual education combination counseling , cotinine feedback , contingent incentive . Outcome measure obtain prior intervention , Months 5 , 9 , 12 . Preteens intervention condition receive eight in-home counseling session seven phone counsel session 5-month period . Urine sample analyze cotinine use highly sensitive ( detection limit .05 ng/ml ) reliable procedure employ CDC ( ID-LC/MS/MS ) . The measure use cotinine feedback preteens intervention condition . Repeated measure analyse differential exposure ETS employ . Mixed effect regression ( REML ) generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) model use outcome analysis . Exploratory analysis address question environmental social determinant tobacco use ETS exposure base researcher 's Behavioral Ecological Model . Primary objective include follow : 1 ) determine whether counsel plus cotinine feedback incentive reduces ETS exposure usual tobacco control education ( measure self-report ETS exposure preteen parent , preteen urine cotinine Month 5 ) ; 2 ) determine whether experimental condition result differential maintenance ETS exposure-reduction compare usual tobacco control education follow-up ( measure self-report ETS exposure preteen parent , preteen urine cotinine Months 9 12 ) . Secondary objective include follow : 1 ) explore whether differential rate cigarette experimentation group ; explore whether differential rate experimentation alcohol/drugs among group ; 2 ) explore differential level tobacco use `` susceptibility '' among experimental group ; 3 ) explore degree youth avoid ETS exposure family member friends ; 4 ) explore multiple social possible genetic factor independent combine association ETS exposure change exposure ( measure preteen parent self-report Months 5 , 9 , 12 ) .</detailed_description>
