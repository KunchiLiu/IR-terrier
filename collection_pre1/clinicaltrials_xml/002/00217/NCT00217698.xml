	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Giving gefitinib first-line therapy follow gemcitabine cisplatin disease progression may effective treatment non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well gefitinib work first-line therapy follow gemcitabine cisplatin treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib First-Line Therapy Followed Gemcitabine Cisplatin Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy gefitinib first-line therapy , term response rate ( complete partial response ) stability disease , patient de novo recurrent stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine efficacy gemcitabine combine cisplatin administer first-line gefitinib patient . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 3 week document disease progression , patient receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 follow cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , week 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , every 12 week thereafter gefitinib treatment . During chemotherapy , quality life assess 1 week prior start chemotherapy treatment , day 1 course 3 5 , every 12 week disease progression . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : ` A total 24-63 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
