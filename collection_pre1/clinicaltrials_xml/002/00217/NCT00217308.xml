	<brief_title>Effect Probiotic Lactobacilli Vaginal Flora Pregnant Women High Risk Preterm Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm labour involve multiple cause - one significant factor prior history preterm birth . Infection another major cause preterm labour ( PTL ) estimate cause 30 % PTL . Bacterial Vaginosis ( BV ) alteration endogenous vaginal microflora precede decrease presence Lactobacilli specie increase growth gardnerella pathogen . BV strong risk factor PTL , associate 40 % increase risk population . Initial study suggest treatment BV antibiotic could decrease incidence PTL , confirm randomized trial . There substantial evidence `` normal '' lactobacillus dominate urogenital microflora play important role maintenance healthy urinary reproductive tract . One hundred sixty ( 160 ) woman high risk PTL , base prior history preterm birth , approach first antenatal visit participate . Recruitment 54 patient symptomatic asymptomatic BV ( base Nugent Scoring ) . Women document BV randomize either treatment lactobacilli preparation ( n=27 ) placebo ( n=27 ) . Women symptomatic BV treat oral Metronidazole prior start lactobacilli placebo . None subject , researcher clinical staff know preparation woman receive . This study first examine ability lactobacilli preparation maintain normal vaginal flora pregnant woman . In addition , result potentially serve basis multi-centre RCT determine efficacy treatment prevent preterm birth .</detailed_description>
