	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Since initial description 125 year ago , sarcoidosis continue `` challenge '' disease . Its etiology remain unknown . Discovering etiology sarcoidosis remain major goal important implication regard treatment , predict outcome , well determine approach preventive measure . Immunological response granulomatous tissue formation characterize sarcoidosis similar observe variety infectious disease . However , nature specific antigen ( ) , putatively trigger inflammatory response sarcoidosis , remain elusive . Occurrence sarcoidosis spatially related cluster , household health care setting strongly support person-to-person transmission infectious agent one potential cause disease . Sarcoidosis associate variety infectious agent , none culture . Propionibacterium acne ( P. acne ) M.tuberculosis ( Mtb ) commonly identifiable infectious pathogen PCR-based method consider associated development disease . Immunological study sarcoidosis focus largely assessment constitutive , immune response description phenotype blood lung cell patient control subject . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study utilize memory immune response search tool 'immunological imprint ' P. acne Mtb exposure . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell bronchoalveolar cell compare patient stage II and/or stage III sarcoidosis healthy control subject . Investigators use ELISPOT assay study : ( 1 ) frequency pathogen-specific interferon-7 interleukin-10-producing cell , ( 2 ) utilize P. acnes- Mtb-infected autologous monocyte alveolar macrophage target cell frequency pathogen-specific granzyme B-releasing cytotoxic T lymphocytes natural killer cell . Finally , investigator test feasibility identify DNA micro array , pathogen specific , transcriptional host gene expression profile P. acnes- Mtb-stimulated blood cell healthy control subject patient active sarcoidosis compare gene expression profile autologous , unstimulated situ lung cell . The study address role P. acnes Mtb etiology sarcoidosis also serve basis model future work involve possible infectious non-infectious pathogens/antigens development sarcoidosis .</detailed_description>
