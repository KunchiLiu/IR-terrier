	<brief_title>Aurograb Vancomycin MRSA Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Primary Objective determine whether overall response ( clinical bacterial ) Aurograb® ( 1mg/kg i.v . b.d . ) plus vancomycin great overall response placebo plus vancomycin , adult hospitalise patient severe , deep-seated staphylococcal infection , particularly MRSA infection , treat vancomycin . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine efficacy , compare Aurograb versus placebo , regard : - attributable mortality - overall mortality - clinical response - bacterial response ie eradication persistence infection - rate clinical resistance vancomycin . 2 . To compare safety profile treatment Aurograb® ( 1mg/kg b.d . ) plus vancomycin versus placebo plus vancomycin adult hospitalise patient deep-seated staphylococcal infection . 3 . To extend data base pharmacokinetics .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient satisfy follow inclusion criterion enter study : Hospitalised adult patient ( 18 year ) severe , deepseated staphylococcal infection treat vancomycin , diagnosis base clinical sign symptom appropriate site infection ( detailed subset , Section 4.6 ) plus positive culture Gram stain show Gram positive cocci cluster ( chain ) one follow clinically significant site : i. blood culture ii . low respiratory tract specimen eg sputum BAL iii . pleural fluid iv . intraabdominal fluid tissue v. urine ( patient renal sepsis complicate urinary tract infection ) The study drug must start clinical evidence active infection ( usually within 24 hour start vancomycin , although long delay acceptable patient still clinically septic culture positive within 24 hour start study drug ) . Recruitment may initiate basis Gram stain , patient eligible continue study , staphylococcal sepsis must subsequently confirm culture . The positive specimen must clinically significant specimen take within 2 day start study drug . Patients must i.v . vancomycin sole systemic antibiotic first 3 day study . Patients must sufficient venous access permit administration study drug monitoring safety variable Written inform consent must obtain participation study . Patients fulfil follow criterion enter study : Prior Antibiotic Usage : Patients receive ( within 48 hour study entry ) systemic antistaphylococcal antibiotic vancomycin longer 24 hour , unless patient consider fail regime ie document treatment failure ( ie 3 day ’ treatment respond ) Staphylococcus resistant antibiotic vitro ( e.g . patient initially treat flucloxacillin isolate subsequently identify resistant ) – case antibiotic must change vancomycin enter study . Concomitant Antibiotics : usage concomitant antibiotic except allow protocol ( see Section 5.3 ) Patients device infect S. aureus , include implant catheter , remove Patients know AIDS , CD4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 Patients staphylococcal endocarditis , mediastinitis , meningitis , osteomyelitis and/or joint infection . Asymptomatic carrier MRSA – patient must clinically septic due MRSA Patients methicillinsensitive CNS ( MSSE ) Patients methicillinresistant CNS ( MRSE ) unless clinically significant blood culture isolate , indicate two blood culture ( take two different site ) grow CNS clinically septic patient significant pathogen responsible sepsis Females positive pregnancy test Patients know allergy constituent Aurograb® ( i.e . hypersensitivity antibody , nickel , urea arginine ) Patients receive unlicensed drug within three month prior study Patients concomitant medical condition , , opinion Investigator , participation may create unacceptable risk patient Patients consider inappropriate enrolment study Investigator reason .</criteria>
