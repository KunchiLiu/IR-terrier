	<brief_title>Better Asthma Outcomes : Lowering Tobacco Smoke Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Secondhand tobacco smoke ( SHS ) exposure increase asthma morbidity child . Efforts reduce exposure mixed result . This study randomize control trial exposure reduction intervention , objective feedback parent child 's exposure base urine cotinine measurement , counsel tailor child 's specific exposure sources/locations parental readiness take specific action reduce exposure source/location . This trial involve 350 SHS-exposed child persistent asthma , 3-12 year age , receive care Kaiser Health Care Program Northern California . Primary outcomes 18 month follow-up asthma acute care utilization urine cotinine/creatine ratio . Changes controller medication adherence evaluate use pharmacy-based dispense index . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Primary objective : To evaluate efficacy behaviorally-based , cotinine-feedback-and-monitoring program design reduce SHS exposure 18-month randomize control trial ( RCT ) 350 child persistent asthma , 3-12 year age , comparison usual medical care . Secondary objective : 1 ) investigate behavioral mechanism mediate intervention associate improvement asthma outcome , 2 ) determine influence initial caregiver stage change regard smoking practice response intervention . Hypotheses : 1 . Disease outcomes : A behaviorally-based , individually-tailored intervention emphasize SHS exposure reduction , provide sequential feedback parent child 's urine cotinine level , tailor parent 's stage change regard smoking practice associate decreased asthma crisis care utilization improvement secondary disease outcomes 18-month follow-up period compare usual medical care . 2 . ETS exposure : The SHS reduction intervention associate low SHS exposure follow-up ( assessed urine cotinine/creatinine ratio ) , compare usual medical care . 3 . Mechanism : Decreases urine cotinine/creatinine ratio instrumental intervention-associated improvement asthma crisis care utilization .</detailed_description>
