	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , bevacizumab see well work compare oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil treat patient undergone surgery stage II colon cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . It yet know whether give combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab effective combination chemotherapy alone treat colon cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin , Leucovorin Calcium , Fluorouracil With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Stage II Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate improvement 3-year disease-free survival high-risk stage II colon cancer patient randomly assign 5-FU ( fluorouracil ) , leucovorin ( leucovorin calcium ) , oxaliplatin versus 5-FU , leucovorin , oxaliplatin bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival regimen . II . To define toxicity profile regimen . III . To prospectively determine impact tumor biological characteristic survival patient stage II colon cancer . IV . To assess association oxaliplatin exposure , allelic variant candidate gene , neurotoxicity . ( Pharmacogenetic ancillary objective ) OUTLINE : Patients high-risk disease randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( Arms A B ) . Patients low-risk disease assign Arm C. ARM A : Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 . Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour begin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil Arm A bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive bevacizumab alone 12 additional course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM C : Patients undergo observation . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month 10 year .</detailed_description>
