	<brief_title>Inflammatory Processes Airway Asthmatics With Persistent Bronchial Hyperreactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Inhaled Glucocorticoid Withdrawal Protocol investigate abnormality asthmatic airway occur set `` natural '' endogenous exacerbation . It known chronic treatment inhale glucocorticoid cause nearly complete disappearance inflammatory cell airway improvement bronchial hyperreactivity , yet patient persistent bronchial hyperreactivity . Withdrawal inhale glucocorticoid cause worsen bronchial hyperreactivity . These observation suggest chronic derangement asthmatic airway might exist , unmasked withdrawal inhale glucocorticoid reinitiates inflammatory process . These `` persistent '' abnormality asthmatic airway may see quiescent stage chronic asthma even airway inflammatory change evident . The abnormality may see period treatment inhaled glucocorticoid may appear one first sign withdrawal inhale glucocorticoid , thereby initiate recurrence asthma promote inflammation . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The purpose study examine inflammatory process airway moderate severe persistent asthmatic persistent bronchial hyperreactivity despite chronic administration inhale glucocorticoid . Each participant undergo bronchoscopic procedure assessment bronchial hyperreactivity follow two time point : 1 ) treatment inhale fluticasone ; 2 ) acute withdrawal inhale fluticasone . The primary outcome study change CD3 positive T cell airway submucosa . The key secondary outcome follow : 1 ) inflammatory cell marker airway ( e.g. , CD4 , CD8 , CD68 , CD45 , EG2/MBP , tryptase , neutrophil elastase ) ; 2 ) RANTES ( regulate activation , normal T express secrete ) expression airway ; 3 ) FEV1 peak expiratory flow ; 4 ) methacholine PC20 ; 5 ) asthma symptom score .</detailed_description>
