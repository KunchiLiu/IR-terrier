	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together several chemotherapy drug ( combination chemotherapy ) work treat patient peripheral T-cell lymphoma natural killer cell neoplasm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Natural Killer Cell Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine 12-month progression-free survival patient peripheral T-cell natural killer cell neoplasms treat bevacizumab combination chemotherapy comprise cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ( A-CHOP ) . Secondary - Determine overall response rate ( complete remission [ CR , unconfirmed CR , functional CR ] partial remission ) patient course 3 , 6 , 8 treatment regimen . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive 6-8 cycle A-CHOP follow 8 cycle maintenance bevacizumab ( MA ) , outline . Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg administer day 1 90 min ( first cycle ) , 60 min ( second cycle ) 30 min subsequent cycle . CHOP ( cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 ; doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 ; vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 [ max . 2 mg ] ; prednisone 100 mg daily day 1-5 ) administer day 1 21-day cycle . Radiographic response assess cycle 3 , 6 8 ACHOP cycle 8 MA . Patients receive six cycle ACHOP achieve complete response ( CR ) three cycle , eight cycle achieve partial response ( PR ) three cycle . Non-responders remove study . ACHOP responder receive maintenance bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 21 day eight cycle . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 43 patient accrue study within 22 month . ACTUAL ACCRUAL : 46</detailed_description>
