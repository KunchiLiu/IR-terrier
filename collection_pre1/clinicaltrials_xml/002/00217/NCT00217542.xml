	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose recombinant interferon alfa-2b give together azacitidine treat patient stage III stage IV melanoma stage IV kidney cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere growth tumor cell . Giving azacitidine together recombinant interferon alfa-2b may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma Stage IV Kidney Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine adverse event profile maximum tolerate dose interferon alfa-2b combine azacitidine patient unresectable stage III IV melanoma unresectable stage IV renal cell carcinoma . II . Determine feasibility regimen future phase II trial . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) daily day 1-4 15-17 recombinant interferon alfa-2b SC day 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 26 course 1 . Beginning course 2 subsequent course , patient receive azacitidine SC daily day 1-3 15-17 interferon alfa-2b SC day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 26 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 total course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos interferon alfa-2b maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2-4 month .</detailed_description>
