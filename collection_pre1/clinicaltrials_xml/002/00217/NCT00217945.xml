	<brief_title>Does Shared Decision-Making Improve Adherence Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma chronic inflammatory disorder airway . Despite major advance understand pathophysiology management , asthma outcome show parallel improvement . Many patient asthma poorly control sub-optimal health status . Asthma care management train non-physician health professional develop mean address problem patient evidence poor control and/or poor adherence controller medication . Shared decision making ( SDM ) clinician patient also propose mean get great patient involvement care , idea may improve medication adherence outcome . However , significant patient involvement also might result less adequate regimen would management base guideline ( MBG ) . Even , increase adherence less adequate regimen might result good outcome poor adherence optimal regimen . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Better Outcomes Asthma Treatment ( BOAT ) randomize control trial ( collaborative study design compare effectiveness three strategy manage patient , 18-70 year age , suboptimally control , persistent asthma . The three treatment strategy : usual care ( UC ) ; management guideline ( MG ) ; third , shared decision making ( SDM ) arm , seek formally involve patient therapeutic decision-making process . Under present grant , 302 study participant recruit membership Kaiser Permanente - Northern California Region ( KPNC ) , San Francisco , Oakland , Richmond medical center . In collaborate grant ( No.HL67092-03 ) 311 patient recruit Kaiser Permanente clinical facility Portland , OR , Honolulu , HI . Patients randomize equally three treatment arm follow baseline assessment asthma control , medication use , lung function , behavioral psychological characteristic . Their health care utilization asthma acquisition asthma medication follow total 24 month post-randomization health system record , reassess 12 mo . Those assign care management condition receive asthma education objective feedback level asthma control . Those assigned MBG condition prescribe regimen appropriate severity asthma accordance standard guideline asthma management . Those assigned SDM condition participate process elicit goal asthma treatment priority regard asthma medication , engage process share decision make care manager design arrive prescribe regimen satisfy goal preference . Analysis data compare two care management approach usual care term primary outcome .</detailed_description>
