	<brief_title>Significance Biological Markers Patients With Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Respiratory failure due ALI acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) remain major health problem despite significant progress intensive care unit ( ICU ) care ventilator management . It also characterize unacceptably high mortality rate despite enormous expenditure health care resource . Survivors respiratory failure face long-term consequence concern quality life . New therapy need improve early survival decrease long-term sequelae syndrome . The purpose study identify biological marker disease patient ALI predictive either disease susceptibility prognosis , identify novel target therapeutic intervention . DESIGN NARRATIVE : As soon possible case identification , informed consent obtain patient next kin . Physiologic measurement specimen collection begin time entry study . The inclusion criterion study allow entry patient fulfil criterion ALI/ARDS 48 hour . Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid blood collect various time onset ALI/ARDS order measure level predetermine set biological marker . In addition , DNA collect patient analysed presence specific genetic polymorphism might alter either disease susceptibility clinical expression disease . The level marker presence specific genetic polymorphism correlate measure pulmonary inflammation extent lung injury , define : 1 ) PaO2/FiO2 ratio ; 2 ) lung compliance ; 3 ) plateau pressure ; 4 ) calculation Murray Lung Injury Score ( obtain entry Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7,10 , 14 , 21 ) . Secondary outcome measure directly correlate biomarker expression include indicator maladaptive response ALI ( include development multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [ MODS ] ) , fibroproliferation , nosocomial pneumonia ( event greatly impact clinical course patient ALI/ARDS ) . Thus , secondary outcome measure include : 1 ) development organ failure ( use Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [ SOFA ] score ) ; 2 ) time ventilator ; 3 ) ventilator-free day ; 4 ) ICU hospital length stay ; 5 ) hospital mortality ; 6 ) development pneumonia ; 7 ) development lung fibrosis ( determine high-resolution compute tomography [ HRCT ] pulmonary function test ) ; 8 ) health relate lung-specific quality life ( assessed Medical Outcome Studies 36-Item Short form Health Survey Standard Form [ SF-36 ] St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ) .</detailed_description>
