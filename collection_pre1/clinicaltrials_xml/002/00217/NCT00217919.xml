	<brief_title>Reducing Risk Factors Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Patients PAD 3- 4-fold high risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality compare patient without PAD . Risk future cardiovascular event comparable patient PAD coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . While improve atherosclerotic risk factor treatment reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality patient CAD , treatment patient PAD remain suboptimal . Intensity cholesterol-lowering therapy , specifically , significantly poor patient PAD compare CAD . Data show fully 69 percent patient PAD non-invasive vascular laboratory Chicago recommend LDL-C level less 100 mg/dl . Our data national survey indicate physician believe atherosclerotic risk factor treatment less important patient PAD patient CAD . Our data also show many patient PAD unaware increase risk cardiovascular event under-appreciate importance risk factor treatment PAD . These finding likely contribute risk factor under-treatment patient PAD . Clinical trial need demonstrate whether PAD risk factor reduce . If effective , clinical trial also encourage clinician adopt prove intervention lower cardiovascular risk patient PAD DESIGN NARRATIVE : This randomize , control clinical trial test ability health-counselor mediate telephone counsel intervention compare usual care reduce LDL-C level patient PAD . The study involve patient PAD LDL-C level great 100 mg/dl baseline identify non-invasive vascular laboratory Chicago , IL Worcester , MA . For primary specific aim , investigator hypothesize subject randomize intervention condition achieve reduction LDL-C least 11.1 mg/dl great reduction LDL-C subject randomize usual care condition 12-month follow-up . In secondary aim , determine whether telephone counsel intervention increase proportion PAD patient LDL-C le 100 mg/dl compare usual care condition 12-month follow-up . To identify mediator intervention , exploratory aim determine whether patient intervention condition achieve great increase ( improvement ) specific behavioral knowledge attitude mediator target intervention , compare patient usual care condition .</detailed_description>
