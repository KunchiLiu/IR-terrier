	<brief_title>Pelvic Exenteration Treating Patients With Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I. Correlate progression-free survival overall survival tumor size , time interval primary cancer management pelvic exenteration , presence absence pelvic sidewall fixation clinical examination patient recurrent cervical cancer treat pelvic exenteration . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine quality life patient treated procedure . II . Correlate quality life reconstructive technique ( e.g. , ostomy ≥ 1 ostomy ) patient treated procedure . OUTLINE : Patients undergo pelvic exenteration within 14 day study entry . Quality life assess baseline 6 , 12 , 24 month surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 30 day , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
