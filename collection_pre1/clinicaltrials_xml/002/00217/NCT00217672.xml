	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell stop blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give docetaxel together bevacizumab effective docetaxel alone treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give docetaxel together bevacizumab work compare docetaxel alone first-line therapy treat woman stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel With Bevacizumab First-Line Therapy Treating Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial begin 2-arm study docetaxel-alone arm . When bevacizumab become widely available , convert 1-arm open-label trial docetaxel/bevacizumab . Patients enrol docetaxel-alone arm permit cross docetaxel/bevacizumab . Patients receive bevacizumab 15 mg/kg docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously ( I.V . ) every 3 week disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , consent withdrawal .</detailed_description>
