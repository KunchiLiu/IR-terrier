	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use goserelin anastrozole may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Giving goserelin together anastrozole may effective treatment male breast cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give goserelin together anastrozole work treat men recurrent metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) men estrogen receptor- progesterone receptor-positive recurrent metastatic breast cancer treat goserelin anastrozole . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine overall objective tumor response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) patient measurable disease treat regimen . - Correlate prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) , testosterone , estradiol , estrone , estrone sulfate , follicle-stimulating hormone , luteinizing hormone , dehydroepiandrosterone level PFS response patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive goserelin subcutaneously day 1 oral anastrozole day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow approximately 4-6 week every 3-6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 56 patient accrue study within 48 month .</detailed_description>
