	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness genetically engineer antibody , alemtuzumab ( Campath [ R ] ) patient myelodysplastic syndrome . MDS make malignant stem cell disorder mean low level red blood cells-that , anemia-and low count white blood cell platelet . Patients MDS risk infection , spontaneous bleeding , possible progression leukemia , cancer bone marrow . Although bone marrow produce blood cell , patient MDS experience decrease production blood cell . Alemtuzumab recognize specific type white cell call lymphocyte destroys . This study examine usefulness medication also side effect patient MDS . Patients age 18 72 MDS require transfusion HIV life expectancy le 6 month may eligible study . Screening test include complete physical examination medical history . There collection 8 tablespoon blood analysis blood count well liver , kidney , thyroid function ; pregnancy test ; electrocardiogram ( EKG ) measure electrical activity heartbeat ; echocardiogram ( ECHO ) , use sound wave evaluate heart function ; wear Holter monitor 24 hour electrical activity heart record ; bone marrow biopsy . Patients receive vaccine take alemtuzumab least 12 month last dose . In addition , patient take herbal supplement Echinacea purpurea Usnea 2 week begin study . For study , patient receive test dose 1 mg alemtuzumab infuse vein course 1 hour . If dose tolerate , medication give 10 mg dos vein 10 day , infusion 2 hour . Blood sample 2 tablespoon take daily , vital sign measure daily . The ECHO 24-hour Holter monitoring repeat patient receive last dose medication . Because suppression immune system result decrease white cell fight infection , patient take medication protect infection treat infection occur . If need , patient receive blood transfusion MDS . Side effect alemtuzumab involve temporarily significant lower number red blood cell , white cell , platelet . Side effect infusion rigidity , stiffness , fever , well risk infection result decrease white blood cell . Blood count reaction procedure carefully monitor throughout study . After patient receive last dose alemtuzumab , follow-up refer doctor NIH . They must able return NIH 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , annually 5 year study . At follow-up visit , blood test reevaluate blood count test presence virus . Blood test do weekly first 3 month patient complete take alemtuzumab , every week 6 month , annually 5 year . There also repeat ECHO 3-month visit , repeat bone marrow biopsy 5-month 12-month follow-up visit , need . This study may may direct benefit participant . For , antibody may improve blood count decrease need transfusion . Knowledge gain study may help people future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Alemtuzumab ( CampathR ) Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many bone marrow failure syndrome human recognize result immunological mechanism . These disease include aplastic anemia , pure red cell aplasia , type myelodysplasia . Patients condition , may suffer variable degree anemia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , alone combination , show respond wide variety immunosuppressive agent , range corticosteroid cyclosporine ( CsA ) horse antithymocyte globulin ( h-ATG ) . However , non-response relapse continue problem . Why patient respond initially others respond relapse unclear . Autoreactive T cell may resistant effect h-ATG/CsA ( non-responders ) , others , residual autoreactive T cell expand post-treatment leading hematopoietic stem cell destruction recurrent pancytopenia ( relapse ) . Therefore , novel , less toxic immunosuppressive regimen increase response rate hematologic recovery decrease relapse rate need . One novel therapy , alemtuzumab ( Campath [ R ] ) humanize IgG1 monoclonal antibody direct CD52 protein , highly express lymphoid cell monocytes . Alemtuzumab ( Campath [ R ] ) , produce profound persistent lymphopenia , affect predominantly CD4+ T cell subset . This property make attractive treatment wide range disease include rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis , ocular inflammatory disease , lymphoid malignancy , organ allograft rejection , condition regimen stem cell transplantation prevent graft failure graft-versus-host disease . We therefore propose non-randomized , label , pilot , Phase I/II study alemtuzumab ( Campath ) MDS patient likely respond immunosuppression . Primary endpoint change peripheral blood count ( platelet , absolute neutrophil count , reticulocyte count , hemoglobin ) . Secondary endpoint ( transfusion-dependent patient ) include improvement transfusion requirement ( measured decrease number transfusion administer need basis ) , duration response , late effect treatment , relapse survival .</detailed_description>
