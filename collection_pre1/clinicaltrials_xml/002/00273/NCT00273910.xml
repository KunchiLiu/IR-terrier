	<brief_summary>This study evaluate immunization effect vaccine patient risk recurrence skin cancer . That , risk cancer high melanoma invade deep skin lymph node . Currently , therapy U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve prevent recurrence melanoma alpha-interferon . But research data controversial . In study , vaccine use , call gp100 , contain piece protein call peptide , melanoma cancer cell produce . Patients 16 old confirm melanoma surgically remove whose tissue type test human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A serotype group ( HLA-A2 ) , specific blood test , may eligible study . Up 132 participant enrol . There physical examination collection blood sample test , make sure x-rays scan current . Patients randomly assign four group . Group 1 receive peptide adjuvant ( assistant ) oil-based liquid call Montanide ISA-51 , injection thigh . Group 2 receive gp100 , Montanide , cream call imiquimod , FDA approve treat genital wart herpes may help immune cell skin recognize vaccine . Imiquimod apply skin 5 day . Group 3 receive gp100 mixed salt water give several mini-doses skin thigh . Group 4 also receive several mini-doses gp100 mixed saline , well imiquimod cream apply skin 5 day . All patient receive gp100 every 3 week 12 week . Every dose cycle , four cycle consider course therapy . If melanoma return patient experience side effect therapy , course vaccine repeat 12 cycle therapy ( 3 course 33 week ) . Side effect peptide vaccination include local swelling , swell local lymph node , bruising , pain redness injection site . There may chill fever . Patients watch closely side effect . To study vaccine change action cell immune system , patient ' white blood cell ( lymphocyte ) obtain , involve separate inform consent . The procedure , call leukaphersis , require insert needle arm , obtain blood go machine , divide blood red cell , plasma ( serum part ) , lymphocytes . The lymphocyte remove , plasma red cell return patient second needle arm . Risks associated procedure include fainting , prevent patient ' eat come lab , bleed infection needle site . Patients undergo leukapheresis do four time : receiving vaccine , 3 week first four dos , 8 cycle 12 cycle . Patients assign group receive imiquimod ask record every time apply cream describe symptom develop study . All patient watch closely sign melanoma return . Before throughout study , multiple blood test conduct . The vaccine , Montanide , imiquimod may increase patient ' immune system fight new tumor , know . However , study may provide information useful treating melanoma patient future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Impact Adjuvants Accompanying Peptide Immunization High-Risk Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : A previous clinical trial conduct Surgery Branch National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) gp100 immunization administer patient melanoma adjuvant setting . In prior protocol , peptide emulsify Incomplete Freund 's Adjuvant administer subcutaneously use several different schedule well tolerate except mild transient erythema site injection . Each schedule provide successful immunization although q3w schedule best tolerate locally three course immunization appear sufficient use regimen . An important finding adjuvant protocol however significant increase immune precursor specifically reactive peptide tumor occur increase course immunization . These finding encourage u explore optimal method generate immune precursor use gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide test impact additional immune adjuvant , imiquimod , report increase immunize potential antigen well evaluate alternate route injection , intradermal administration . Objectives : The primary objective trial evaluate immunologic activity immunization four different preparation gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) melanoma antigen peptide potentially select one study . Eligibility : HLA-A 0201 patient , age great equal 16 year , primary melanoma lesion ulcerate great equal 2mm , lesion great equal 4.0 mm thickness , great equal 1 positive lymph node , local recurrence , resect metastatic disease , within 6 month surgical resection consider . Patients ocular mucosal melanoma require systemic steroid therapy exclude . The following patient also exclude : previously immunize gp100 ; know hypersensitivity agent use study ; previously receive chemotherapy treatment melanoma ; undergo undergone past 3 week systemic therapy except surgery cancer . Design : Patients randomize one follow four arm : 1. gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide emulsify MONTANIDE ISA-51 Montanide ISA 51 VG inject subcutaneously day one every three week ( 1 cycle ) total twelve cycle ( 33 week ) . 2. gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide emulsify MONTANIDE ISA-51 Montanide ISA 51 VG inject subcutaneously day one every three week ( 1 cycle ) total twelve cycle ( 33 week ) ; follow injection patient apply imiquimod skin site injection daily 5 day . 3. gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) 0.9 % Sodium Chloride Injection inject intradermally day one every three week ( 1 cycle ) total twelve cycle ( 33 week ) . 4. gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide 0.9 % Sodium Chloride Injection inject intradermally day one every three week ( 1 cycle ) total twelve cycle ( 33 week ) ; follow injection patient apply imiquimod skin site injection daily 5 day . Immunizations administer outpatient basis unless side effect patient 's clinical condition warrant hospitalization . Patients receive full clinical evaluation three week 8 cycle 12 cycle . Each arm conduct use two-stage optimal design Since primary objective select one regimen among four basis immune response , design allow great 80 % probability correctly select superior arm either tie number immune response , least one immune response one arm three arm , true response rate 15 % , 15 % , 15 % 35 % . Initially , 19 patient enrolled arm evaluate ; 0 3 19 arm immune response T2 cell pulse 0.01 M peptide 4th , 8th , 12th cycle , patient would randomize receive peptide arm . If least four immunologic response note 8th cycle , accrual 33 patient would take place . If four arm need complete 33 patient need complete arm , total 132 patient require .</detailed_description>

Patients must clinically disease free time protocol entry document radiologic study within 6 week patient entry . Serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dl less Total bilirubin 1.6 mg/dl less , except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . WBC 3000/mm^3 great , Platelet count 90,000 mm^3 great , Serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less three time normal , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Patients gender must willing practice effective birth control trial potential teratogenic effect unknown . Patients may prior adjuvant treatment immunotherapy , include interferon , long 3 week elapse since prior systemic therapy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude : Who ocular mucosal melanoma . Who undergo undergone past 3 week systemic therapy except surgery cancer , must recover grade I adverse effect treatment prior entry , clinical implication , e.g . vitiligo , alopecia . Have active systemic infection , autoimmune disease know immunodeficiency disease . Who require systemic steroid therapy . Who pregnant ( possible side effect fetus ) breastfeed unknown effect develop child ) . Who know positive hepatitis BsAG human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody ( possible immune effect condition ) . Who form autoimmune disease ( autoimmune colitis Crohn 's Disease ) immunodeficiency evidence abnormal white blood count ( WBC ) count 8 and/or presence opportunistic infection . Must recover immune competence radiation therapy . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Who previously immunize gp100 . Who know hypersensitivity agent use study . Who previously receive chemotherapy treatment melanoma .</criteria>
