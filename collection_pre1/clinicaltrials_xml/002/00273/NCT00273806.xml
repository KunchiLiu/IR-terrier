The primary analysis compare outcome measure smoke , problem drinking , sedentary lifestyle , unhealthy diet intervention control patient . We anticipate study show medical assistant-based program address smoking , risky drinking , sedentary living , unhealthy diet primary care feasible effective . We evaluate program effectiveness assess number patient reach , intervention request complete , impact medical assistant workflow satisfaction , cost practice , impact health behavior .</detailed_description>
