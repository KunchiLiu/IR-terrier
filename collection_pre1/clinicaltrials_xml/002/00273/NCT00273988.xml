	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study Interaction Between Nevirapine Methadone HIV-1 Infected , Opioid-dependent Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten HIV-1 infected , opioid-dependent adult stable methadone treatment enrol study . This open-label , sequential treatment study , methadone pharmacokinetics sample twenty-one ( 21 ) day nevirapine administration . All patient receive regimen . Methadone administer first treatment period , combination treatment methadone nevirapine give second treatment period . In first period , patient receive methadone current steady state dose . In second period ( study day 1-21 ) , also receive nevirapine 200mg qd ( study day 1 14 ) 200mg bid ( study day 15 21 ) . Blood sample take start first treatment period end second treatment period analysis methadone nevirapine pharmacokinetics parameter . Study Hypothesis : It expect nevirapine would decrease methadone level patient population . Comparison ( ) : The study compare methadone steady state exposure absence presence steady state nevirapine . A range pharmacokinetics parameter assess include clearance methadone ( primary endpoint variable ) , area concentration-time curve , maximum concentration , time maximum concentration minimum concentration ( measure methadone nevirapine ) .</detailed_description>
