	<brief_title>Study Costs Safety Early Conversion From Intravenous Oral Antibiotic Treatment Patients With Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design A multi-center , randomize open label clinical trial perform 2 university medical center 5 teach hospital Netherlands . The study approve medical ethic committee participate hospital patient provide write informed consent prior enrollment . After inclusion trial , treatment allocation establish independent central randomization center . Stratified randomization per center base computer generate table . Patients either randomized intervention group , clinically stable patient switch IV oral antibiotic 3rd day hospitalization complete total 10 day antibiotic treatment , control group , receive standard regimen 7 day intravenous therapy . Clinical stability define respiratory rate &lt; 25/min , O2 saturation &gt; 90 % arterial pO2 &gt; 55mmHg , hemodynamically stable , &gt; 1oC decrease temperature case fever , absent mental confusion ability take oral medication 10 . Antibiotic choice leave discretion attend consultant base Dutch treatment guideline 20 . Patients Adult patient ( age 18 ) severe CAP admit general hospital ward eligible inclusion study . Pneumonia define new progressive infiltrate chest X-ray plus least two follow criterion : cough , sputum production , rectal temperature &gt; 38oC &lt; 36.1oC , auscultatory finding consistent pneumonia , leucocytosis ( &gt; 10.000/mm3 , &gt; 15 % band ) , C-reactive protein &gt; 3 time upper limit normal , positive blood culture positive culture pleural fluid . 21 Severe pneumonia define Fine class IV V fulfil ATS-criteria severe community-acquired pneumonia . 16 ; 22 Patients cystic fibrosis , history colonization Gram negative bacteria due structural damage respiratory tract , malfunction digestive tract , life expectancy le 1 month due underlying disease , infection pneumonia need antibiotic treatment , severe immunosuppression ( neutropenia ( &lt; 0,5 x 109 / l ) CD4 count &lt; 200 / mm3 ) need mechanical ventilation intensive care unit exclude . Baseline , follow outcome measurement Patients follow maximum 28 day . On admission , complete physical examination , chest radiography blood sample arterial blood gas analysis hematological biochemical analysis perform . Demographic data , initial intravenous therapy clinical data record . During follow-up period , in-hospital clinical data record . Clinical stability evaluate 3 day intravenous therapy study group discharge criterion ( temperature &lt; 37.8 oC , saturation &gt; 92 % , normal blood pressure , heart rate &lt; 100/min , respiratory rate &lt; 25/min , absence mental confusion ability take oral medication ) evaluate daily thereafter . If patient discharge within 28 day admission ask return out-patient clinic 28 day inclusion , history , physical examination , blood chemistry analysis chest X-ray take health-care consumption discharge record . Questionnaires use evaluate effect health care resource use outside hospital ( record daily discharge ) . Quality life determine short form health survey questionnaire ( www.sf-36.org ) record day 3 , 10 28 study . Additional questionnaire use measure effect early discharge workload family member ( questionnaire day 28 study ) effect administration route freedom movement , adverse event compliance ( questionnaire day 7 study ) . Treatment failure define death , clinical deterioration ( clinical worsening patient need mechanical ventilation , re-administration intravenous antibiotic switch oral therapy , readmission pulmonary reinfection discharge , increase temperature initial improvement ) hospitalization day 28 study . Clinical cure define discharge good health without sign symptom pneumonia treatment failure follow-up period . 21 Microbiological analysis Sputum sample blood sample collect , culture evaluate follow standard procedure . Micro-organisms culture blood sputum record . In addition , Binax NOW-tests use detect urinary antigen Legionella pneumophila S. pneumoniae . Acute convalescent serology sample collect evaluated Mycoplasma pneumoniae , L. pneumophila Chlamydia pneumonia . Any non-contaminating micro-organism culture blood sputum sample detect urinary antigen test consider cause episode pneumonia . For Mycoplasma pneumoniae , fourfold great increase titer pair serum single titer great equal 1:40 consider indicative infection . 23 ( Immune fluorescence agglutination , Serodia-MycoII ® , Fujirebio , inc. ) For Legionella pneumophila , fourfold increase antibody titer 1:128 great , single titer 1:256 consider suggestive Legionella pneumonia.24 For Chlamydia pneumoniae , detection IgM establish value , seroconversion IgG acute convalescence sample , high amount IgG single titer combination factor consider serological evidence infection , accord manufacturer instruction . ( ELISA , Savyon Diagnostics Ltd ) Economic evaluation The societal perspective use calculate direct medical cost associate treatment study group . Costs assess 2002 euro . Costs per patient calculate multiply resource use unit cost . Resource use hospital stay diagnostic therapeutic intervention , consultation medical paramedic specialist antibiotic use measure . Resource use outside hospital evaluate use questionnaire record contact general practitioner , specialist , extra diagnostic procedure , use medication , readmission , home care disease-related cost . Additional cost associate specific diagnostic test base tariff . Costs hospital stay , diagnostic procedure specialist consultation , calculate use unit cost determine within realm Dutch guideline pharmaco-economic analysis 25 . Costs readmission reinfections assess specifically study cohort include cost extra diagnostic procedure , treatment hospitalization . Costs antibiotic prescribe estimate use Dutch 2002 formulary cost-prices 26 Sample size statistical analysis To demonstrate equivalence efficacy two treatment group , initially , sample size set 250 patient study group base expect cure rate 85 % IV group acceptance 75 % cure rate switch group . ( =0.05 , 2 side ; 1-=0.80 ) . The absolute difference cure rate include 95 % CI calculate . Equivalence reject low limit CI exceed -10 % . Eventually , less anticipated enrolment , 15 % low effectiveness intervention group could exclude =0.05 1-=0.80 . Analyses perform intention-to-treat basis . Differences continuous variable present absolute difference correspond 95 % CI´s . Dichotomous data compare chi-square statistic . Alike cure rate difference proportion present include 95 % CI´s . For cost-calculations , arithmetic mean study group compare . The uncertainty surround cost-calculations evaluate mean standard bootstrap technique . 27 Ultimately , balance cost effect compare strategy incremental cost per therapy failure avert 28 day calculate . The uncertainty surround incremental cost-effectiveness ratio evaluate mean bootstrapping .</detailed_description>
