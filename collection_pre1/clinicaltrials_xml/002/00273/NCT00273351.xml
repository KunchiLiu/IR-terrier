	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterize rigidity , bradykinesia , postural instability , tremor . Clinical decline reflect ongoing degeneration dopamine-containing neuron . A critical unmet need clinical research improve early detection disease develop tool assist early diagnosis . Biomarkers broadly define characteristic objectively measure evaluated indicator normal biological process , pathogenic process , pharmacologic response therapeutic intervention ( Biomarkers Defintions Working Group 2001 ) . Development reliable biomarkers PD would dramatically accelerate research PD etiology , pathophysiology , disease progression therapeutic . Specific biomarkers may useful onset neurodegeneration , onset disease , and/or mark disease progression . The biomarkers study include brain imaging radioactively label drug ( Beta-CIT ) , computerized test memory , attention , motor speed , judgment handwriting , assessment speech smell . Subjects may also ask provide blood sample genetic biochemical testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals agree participate trial complete screen exam neurologist Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders ( IND ) New Haven , CT . The exam may include blood test , urine test electrocardiogram ( ECG -tracing electrical activity heart ) determine eligibility trial . Research subject participate variety biomarker assessment include brain imaging , take place period two day . On first day subject report IND brief exam subject receive standard dose Lugol 's solution ( potassium iodide ) mouth decrease uptake radioactive drug thyroid gland . Subjects give standard dose potassium perchlorate allergic iodine . Next subject receive intravenous ( IV - vein ) injection Beta-CIT , radioactive material localize brain . On second day , 24 hour injection , subject return IND SPECT scan . The SPECT camera take `` picture '' radiation emit Beta-CIT . This procedure take approximately 30 minute . Subjects contact phone one week follow injection monitor adverse ( bad harmful ) event possibly relate imaging procedure . This two-day imaging procedure , comprehensive neurological testing , blood collection genetics biochemical testing may repeat every 12 18 month next five year .</detailed_description>
