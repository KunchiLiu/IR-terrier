	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Individualised Bone Density Feedback Osteoporosis Education Premenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fractures due osteoporosis major public health problem . Bone density one major predictor osteoporotic fracture result amount bone gain early life ( i.e peak bone mass ) subsequent bone loss . Cigarette smoking , physical inactivity inadequate calcium intake widely regard risk factor osteoporosis ( well common disease former two ) . Despite information widely available actively promote , prevalence risk factor population remain unacceptably high . In woman ( mean age 33 ) take part study determinants bone mass child , recently report substantial change behaviours 12 month follow-up woman receive information leaflet individualise bone density feedback . These woman highly select unclear response representative woman . With study , aim test whether individualised bone density feedback , combine either information leaflet small group education change woman 's osteporosis preventive behavior and/or bone density . Specifically , aim test follow hypothesis : 1 . Women likely change calcium intake physical activity BMD low . 2 . Group education ( form Osteoporosis Prevention Self Management course ) efficacious change lifestyle behaviour information leaflet alone . 3 . Bone density feedback educational intervention independent effect behavior BMD change . 4 . Women improve physical activity dietary calcium intake change bone mass 2 year 0.34-0.54 % per annum better ( depend site lifestyle factor ) alter behaviour .</detailed_description>
