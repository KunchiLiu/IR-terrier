The conceptual framework control trial well-studied Andersen model access health service use , modify chemical dependency service ( Andersen , 1995 ) . The intervention design affect mutable factor perceive barrier treatment . Data collect baseline , 3 6 month thereafter . Analyses examine whether intervention work well different group client ( e.g . cocaine user versus marijuana user , male versus female , different ethnicity , etc ) ; well different treatment modality ( standard outpatient versus intensive outpatient . ) 4 . To conduct quantitative investigation effect Individual Level Health Care System Level factor predict treatment linkage engagement context propose intervention .
