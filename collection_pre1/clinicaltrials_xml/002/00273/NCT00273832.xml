	<brief_title>Study Coronary Artery Computed Tomography Diagnose Emergency Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 6 million patient per year visit hospital emergency department evaluation chest pain , diagnostic cost estimate excess $ 10 billion . Standard diagnostic evaluation often include 8-12 hour serial laboratory test follow stress imaging study require additional 4-8 hour . Multi-slice coronary artery compute tomography scanning ( MSCT ) show highly accurate diagnostic method comparison invasive angiography . Because speed high negative predictive value , MSCT could rapidly screen patient presence coronary disease , may expedite care . This study compare length stay cost care emergency chest pain patient randomly assign initial evaluation MSCT compare patient randomly assign standard diagnostic evaluation include single photon emission compute tomography scanning . The study follow patient detect major adverse cardiac event include unstable angina , acute myocardial infarction death 90-day period .</detailed_description>
