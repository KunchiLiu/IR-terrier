	<brief_title>Amonafide Combination With Cytarabine Secondary AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-stage , open-label , phase 2 , multicenter study amonafide L-malate combination standard-dose cytarabine subject secondary AML . Amonafide DNA intercalate agent inhibitor topoisomerase II extensively study patient malignant solid tumor . Amonafide also study patient AML . In three phase I clinical trial , amonafide demonstrate anti-leukemic activity , monotherapy combination cytarabine . This protocol design assess safety efficacy amonafide combination cytarabine subject previously untreated secondary AML . The duration study approximately 42 month : enrollment approximately 18 month subject duration 24 month</detailed_description>
