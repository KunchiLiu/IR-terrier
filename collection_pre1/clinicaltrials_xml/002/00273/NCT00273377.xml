	<brief_title>The Effects Hypercapnia , Supplemental Oxygen , Dexamethasone Surgical Wound Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wound infection common serious complication anesthesia surgery . Even patient keep normothermic give supplemental oxygen , incidence wound infection colon resection exceed 5 % . About 80 % resection do colon cancer , third lead cause cancer death . The average surgical wound infection prolongs hospitalization week substantially increase cost . Major factor influence incidence surgical wound infection include site complexity surgery , underlie illness ( include treatment immunosuppressive drug ) , timely administration prophylactic antibiotic , intraoperative patient temperature , hypovolemia , tissue oxygen tension . The primary defense surgical pathogen oxidative kill neutrophil . Oxygen substrate process , reaction critically depend tissue oxygen tension throughout observed physiological range . It therefore unsurprising subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension ( PsqO2 ) inversely correlate risk surgical wound infection . Primary determinant tissue oxygen availability include arterial oxygen tension , hemoglobin concentration , local perfusion . An additional determinant peripheral oxygen delivery cardiac output . Mild hypercapnia increase cardiac output : example , augment arterial carbon dioxide tension ( PaCO2 ) 10-12 mmHg increase cardiac index 15 % . Our preliminary study confirm mild hypercapnia increase cardiac output additionally indicate hypercapnia markedly improve tissue oxygenation . For example , tissue oxygen tension increase 16 mmHg , 58 74 mmHg 20 mmHg range PaCO2 anesthetize volunteer . We also show increase PaCO2 15 mmHg increase tissue oxygen tension 16 mmHg surgical patient . Similar result observe morbidly obese patient . Previous work indicate similar increase PsqO2 reduces risk surgical wound infection 30 % . We thus propose test hypothesis mild hypercapnia significantly reduce incidence surgical wound infection normothermic patient undergo colon resection . Secondary outcome include duration hospitalization , cost care , incidence nosocomial pneumonia , incidence postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) return function . High intra- postoperative oxygen concentration ( 80 % , oppose 30 % oxygen ) show reduce rate wound infection 50 % . Therefore , protocol implement high intraoperative oxygen concentration patient trial . However , within first 500 enrolled patient recent trial report well outcome patient low perioperative oxygen concentration . Although trial less well control underpowered , conflict evidence indicate additional study need . We therefore simultaneously test hypothesis supplemental oxygen reduces infection risk . Patients undergo colon surgery generally high risk postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) . According result meta-analyses , single intraoperative dose dexamethasone effective safe prophylaxis PONV . Dexamethasone thus recommend first-line prophylaxis PONV . However , none previous PONV trial focus wound infection sufficiently long observational period rule potential concern increase incidence wound infection . We therefore also test hypothesis dexamethasone increase risk surgical wound infection . The second third hypothesis add protocol , use factorial design , first 500 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
