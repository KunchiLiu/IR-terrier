	<brief_title>Study Using Computerized Education Increase Patients ' Confidence Their Ability Be Screened Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Interactive multimedia computer program ( IMCPs ) show promise facilitating inform patient decision . However , unclear whether IMCPs activate patient deliver personally tailor information bolster self-efficacy , key mediator health behavior . It also unclear whether IMCPs might employ lessen disparity care experience less educated people tailor self-efficacy enhance information educational level compensate provider bias communication . Finally , optimal way deploy IMPCs primary care ( e.g . versus follow office visit ) remain unclear . Aims/Hypotheses : We compare change colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen self-efficacy , intention , uptake , informed decision make result IMCP provide personally tailor information ( subject educational level self-efficacy ) intend boost self-efficacy change result non-tailored control IMCP . We hypothesize intervention control condition result increase CRC screen self-efficacy , increase significantly great intervention group . We also hypothesize intervention control condition increase CRC screen intention , uptake , informed decision making , increase great intervention group mediate self-efficacy enhancement . Methods : Pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) 2 group , compare PCN office visit-linked , tailor ( subject self-efficacy ) IMCP software program plus mailed reminder versus non-tailored CRC screen IMCP software program plus mailed reminder ( control ) . Screening method target fecal occult blood testing , flexible sigmoidoscopy , colonoscopy , compute tomographic virtual colonoscopy . Primary outcome CRC screen self-efficacy , intention , uptake , informed decision making . Implications : Our pilot power detect significant effect CRC screen self-efficacy outcome ; however , conduct would future large RCT , determine protocol feasibility . If hypothesis confirm , would imply cancer screen IMCPs focus enhance self-efficacy . Since self-efficacy mediator many patient health care provider behavior , would also imply similar IMCPs could develop support host patient professional education effort .</detailed_description>
