	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Outcomes Kidney Transplants Patients Steroids Versus Those Who Discontinue Steroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use steroids renal transplantation invaluable , result high rate long term survival transplant kidney . However , post-operative steroid also associate frequent post-operative long term complication . There steroid elimination study analyze acute rejection rate , graft patient survival . These study show many patient safely steroid withdraw equivalent result whan compare remain steroid . With study use rapid steroid elimination protocol 40 patient compare 20 patient remain steroid . We hope show decreased rate complication osteopenia/osteoporosis , new onset diabetes , decrease cardiovascular risk factor hyperlipidemia hypertension . Solumedrol give patient time transplant follow prednisone taper . Those remain steroid discharge prednisone 5 mg daily . Those steroid eliminate prednisone discharge .</detailed_description>
