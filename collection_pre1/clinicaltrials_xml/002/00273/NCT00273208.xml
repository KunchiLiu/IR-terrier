	<brief_summary>This research project do design test whether 10 week program help reduce symptom tire fatigue among woman breast cancer . The pilot study include 4 group woman , two group woman Baltimore two group woman Washington County , Maryland . Each group 5 6 woman . The purpose pilot study help u find best thing include program help woman breast cancer severe problem fatigue last month year treat chemotherapy radiation therapy . Following pilot program conduct evaluate ( use quasi-experimental design compare fatigue score intervention ) efficacy refine 10-week integrate mind/body medicine approach reduce symptom fatigue among breast cancer survivor complete adjuvant therapy . Four intervention group ( ~12 woman per group ) conduct : two urban set two rural set . We assess fatigue symptom baseline , immediately program , 2 month 6 month follow completion program . We compare mean baseline score post-intervention score . The ultimate goal develop non-pharmacologic , holistic , low risk intervention improve symptom fatigue thus improve quality life among breast cancer survivor</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Question : Fatigue common , persistent symptom follow treatment breast cancer , challenge woman 's ability promptly regain overall health well-being . The aim study design , evaluate implement integrate mind-body medicine intervention reduce symptom persistent fatigue . The research question address : Can 10 week mind-body medicine intervention program improve fatigue score disability range non-disabled range improvement fatigue symptom persist 6 month follow intervention ? The aim study Aim I : Pilot test 10 week mind/body medicine group intervention among 4 group breast cancer survivor 5 woman per group . Groups stratify urban/rural setting ( Baltimore region/Washington County ) , race ( African American White ) , educational status . These pilot group evaluate program help refine intervention comprehensible culturally sensitive . Aim II : A 10-week intervention program develop specifically target alleviate fatigue among breast cancer survivor . Weekly session approximately 2 hour duration hold . Four intervention group approximatley 12 woman per group woman conduct two region , urban set rural setting . The intervention conduct Women 's Center Health &amp; Medicine Mercy Medical Center downtown Baltimore Robinwood Outpatient Medical Facility Hagerstown Maryland ( Washington County . ) The Women 's center locate downtown Baltimore access public transportation well convenient park valet service . The Robinwood Center also centrally locate Washington County near Hagerstown , MD . Rationale : Thirty-five percent breast cancer survivor , 1 5 year follow diagnosis breast cancer report symptom fatigue fall disability range , despite remain disease-free ( Bower 2000 , Lindley 1998 ) . There paucity information intervention may useful reduce fatigue symptom . Most intervention focus one factor may contribute fatigue sleep disturbance pain . Exercise intervention try mostly focus fatigue chemotherapy radiation therapy address problem persistent fatigue . Fatigue complex , multi-dimensional symptom several contribute factor . Pain , sleep disturbance , depression , decreased physical activity menopausal symptom associate fatigue ( Couzi 1995 , Servaes 2002 , Bennett 2004 Bower 2000 ) . Therefore , broad-based intervention program hold promise alleviating fatigue . We propose examine efficacy holistic mind/body medicine approach empower woman address many factor associate fatigue incorporate healthy behavior routine alleviate fatigue . The intervention 10 week program model Mind/Body Medicine program establish Dr. Herbert Benson Harvard-affliliated Mind Body Medicine Institute . Methods Study Design : Quasi-experimental : before/after study design . Population : The target population woman breast cancer diagnose within past 5 year . The eligibility criterion include : - Women within 5 year diagnosis breast cancer currently disease free . - Women must complete chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy 6 month prior join study . - Women may take adjuvant hormonal therapy ( e.g . tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor ) - Women score less 50 ( consistent servere fatigue lead disability limitation ) energy/fatigue subscale SF-36 health survey ( Appendix A ) . Intervention : Each session last approximately 90 minute . We offer session convenient time participant ( e.g . early morning , lunch time even ) . The time establish base availability participant . Sample Size : The pilot study recruit 5 woman 4 group : Two urban group , African American White , two rural group , stratify educational status ( less high school ; high school graduate high ) . No formal sample size calculate pilot study . The woman evaluate session comprehension relevance situation ( e.g . exercise intervention may vary significantly urban resident versus rural resident ) . Following completion 10 week program also ask woman evaluate program whole . Sample size calculation main intervention component base result survey fatigue quality life among breast cancer survivor 1 5 year follow diagnosis breast ( Bower 2000 ) . That study use energy/fatigue subscale SF-36 Health Survey ( Ware 1992. ) . That instrument also show correlate Piper fatigue scale , instrument specifically design evaluate among breast cancer patient ( Piper 1998 ) . We administer survey instrument base sample size estimate SF-36 , widely use health survey instrument . The SF-36 energy/fatigue subscale defines disability/limitation score 50 . In survey breast cancer survivor , woman classify disabled due fatigue ( score less 50 subscale ) mean score 37 ( Bower 2000 . ) Overall , study , breast cancer survivor mean score 60 ( standard deviation 20 ) . Women fall disable range energy/fatigue subscale recruit study . We estimate intervention improve mean score level 50/51 ( average 14 point improvement ) non-disabled range . We compare mean score intervention session . Assuming mean score 37 project mean score improvement 14 point 10 woman per intervention group give power 80 % detect mean difference 14 point ( use paired-t-test ) . We recruit 12 patient per group , allow potential dropout intervention . Thus 4 group woman provide adequate power detect meaningful clinical improvement fatigue score . Recruitment : Women recruit Hoffberger Breast Center , Medical Oncology Practice Mercy , , Washington County , John Marsh Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
