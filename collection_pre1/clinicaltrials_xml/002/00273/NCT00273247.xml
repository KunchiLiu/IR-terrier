	<brief_summary>We conduct randomize control trial adjuvant interferon ( IFN ) therapy patient hepatitis-C virus ( HCV ) -related cirrhosis underwent curative resection hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) investigate whether IFN could reduce delay incidence recurrent tumor ( secondary/tertiary prevention HCC ) . Patients randomly assign treatment IFN ( 3MU thrice/wk /48 week ) vs. treatment curative resection HCC ( control group )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With IFN After Curative Resection HCC HCV-Related Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Primary liver cancer ( hepatocellular carcinoma , HCC ) remain major cancer-related cause death estimate incidence 1 million case per year worldwide particular endemic distribution relate chronic hepatitis carrier . Post-necrotic cirrhosis due chronic infection HBV HCV lead background HCC development yearly rate 3 % 5-year probability survival 20 % . Liver surgery , resection transplantation , appear chance curative treatment tumor , feasibility still range 15 30 % Western country time diagnosis . Several alternative treatment available potential curative effect lack , due absence control trial . Liver resection claim feasible order 15-30 % patient HCC mortality report major center extremely low ( 5 % ) . Technical biological device develop set OLT support limit reserve cirrhotic liver resection . Regulated segmentectomy advisable removal whole portal territory belong tumor . Single nodule tumor ( &lt; 5 cm ) compensate cirrhosis ( Child class A ) accept best candidate liver resection perform minimal blood loss , minimal ischemia damage . Intraoperative ultra sound examination routinely use golden standard stag detection previously undiscovered neoplastic nodule . Hepatic decompensation ascites development , cholestasis variceal bleeding within three month surgery main negative prognostic factor patient survival . Five year survival exceed 50 % tumor recurrence due cirrhosis persistence could exceed 30 % three year follow-up . Several attempt reduce recurrence antiangiogenetic antiproliferative agent propose . In present project prospective randomize trial Interferon ( antiproliferative drug ) versus control anti-HCV positive patient investigate homogeneous category resect tumor possible variation natural history namely reduction recurrence rate curative resection . Purpose Study Design The trial intentionally design 1997 unresticted collection patient histologically prove HCC HCV-related cirrhosis select surgical resection tumor 4 experienced surgical Liver Units Italy . Eligible patient stratified basis concomitant anti-core antibody HBV ( anti-HBc ) two population : “ pure HCV ” ( HCV-RNA : positive , anti-HBc : negative ) “ mixed HCV+HBV ” ( HCV-RNA : positive , anti-HBc : positive ) . Within strata patient randomize 1:1 ratio treatment α-interferon ( IFN ) vs. treatment ( control ) . No restriction criterion apply tumor stage , far resection HCC judge potentially curative pre-operative staging , intra-operative ultrasound post-operative pathology ( clearance surgical margin ) . The study originally design lymphoblastoid α-interferon ; soon trial approval NCI-Milan Scientific Ethic Committee ( # 98-016 ) protocol amend allow also use recombinant α-2a ( Roferon-A , Hoffmann-La Roche , Nutley NJ ) α -2b interferon ( Intron-A , Schering-Plough , Kenilworth , NJ ) . The latter eventually preferred form . Patients allocate treatment receive IFN 3 MU/thrice weekly 48 week start within 6 week operation . The severity adverse event treatment monitor rat . Therapy discontinue case life-threatening adverse event case HCC recurrence treatment . For severe event anemia IFN dose reduce 50 % ; full dose could resume event resolve discontinue effect persist . The percentage total predict dose IFN actually assume patient record . Patients assume least 80 % total dose IFN treat least 80 % expect duration therapy priori define adherent therapy . Recurrences priori define “ early ” “ late ” whether occur within 2 year surgical removal HCC . In fact early recurrence relate intra-hepatic metastasis primary tumor possibly miss time therapy , late recurrence might due new cancer focus relate persistence HCV-related carcinogenetic factor . Primary endpoint randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) secondary endpoint disease-specific survival ( DSS ) overall survival ( OS ) . Further secondary endpoint assessment IFN tolerability post-surgical patient observation prognostic factor relate early late recurrence . Adherent patient consider subgroup analysis focus patient effectively receive treatment design prevent HCC recurrence . Enrolment trial start June 1998 . By December 2002 predict sample size 150 randomized patient complete ( “ pure HCV ” : 80 “ mixed HCV+HBV ” : 70 ) . The baseline clinical , laboratory tumor characteristic two arm viral stratum comparable . After 45 month median follow-up three- five- year survival rate 69 % 52.4 % respectively control group 77.3 % 63.6 % respectively IFN group ( P= 0.471 ) . At univariate analysis tumor multiplicity ( &gt; 1 nodule ) vascular invasion significantly relate recurrence . After adjustment relative weight prognostic factor series Cox model cumulative incidence curve calculate pattern recurrence , benefit IFN observe late recurrence occur pure-HCV patient adherent treatment ( hazard rate : 0.3 ; 95 % Confidence interval:0.09-0.9 , P=0.04 ) . In conclusion , although adjuvant IFN fail show generalized effect prevention HCC recurrence curative resection , effectively reduce late recurrence due new tumor foci pure-HCV patient adherent therapy ( i.e . : receive least 80 % IFN dose least 80 % time ) .</detailed_description>
