	<detailed_description>The purpose Pilot clinical study make preliminary clinical procedural assessment treatment chronic venous stasis ulcer Autologous Platelet Gel . The information knowledge gain Pilot Study use refine Investigational Plan Pivotal Clinical Study conduct . One advantage conduct pilot study might give advance warn main research project could fail , research protocol may follow , whether propose method instrument inappropriate complicate achieve expect clinical outcome . The Pilot Study provide preliminary data : - Assess feasibility ( full-scale ) study/survey - Refine clinical protocol procedure - Assess likely success propose recruitment approach - Identifying logistical problem might occur use propose method - Estimating variability outcome help determine sample size - Determine resource ( finance , staff ) need plan study - Assess propose data collection analysis technique uncover potential problem - Confirm study objective feasible - Train researcher element research process protocol - Assess magnitude difference effectiveness investigational treatment v control treatment The pilot study provide support clinical data IDE application FDA approval conduct Pivotal Study safety effectiveness APG treatment chronic venous stasis ulcer . The study evaluate hypothesis treatment chronic venous ulcer APG prepare Autologous Platelet Concentrate ( APC+ ) ( associate autologous growth factor ) Topical Thrombin ( TT ) potential accelerate re-epithelialization process . Harvest Technologies submit market application FDA expand label SmartPReP2® Platelet Concentrate System , include accessory kit , specific indication produce APC purpose promote heal chronic venous ulcer low extremity . 60 100 study subject enrol six investigational site single-phase clinical trial . The SmartPReP®2 Platelet Concentrate System dedicate microprocessor-controlled centrifuge . The SmartPReP®2 centrifuge accessory , APC+ Process Kit , currently available use produce Autologous Platelet Concentrate . The Harvest SmartJet Dual Applicator Kit legally market apply autologous blood product ( K000456 , K011032 , K020252 ) . Topical Thrombin ( TT ) , ( bovine origin ) , USP approve pharmaceutical ( NDC 52604-7102-1 ) market Jones Pharma , Inc. ( Thrombin-JMI® ) supply Harvest must obtain practitioner . This study compare standard care medical therapy without APC+ TT . Therefore , study ulcer Investigational Group receive treatment APC+ TT adjunctive treatment modality addition standard therapy .</detailed_description>
