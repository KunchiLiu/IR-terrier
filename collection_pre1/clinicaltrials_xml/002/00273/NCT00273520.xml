	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - The primary objective evaluate clinical efficacy telithromycin versus placebo supplement usual standard care acute exacerbation asthma . Efficacy assess : - Changes diary card summary symptom score assess daily 6 week , - Changes domiciliary morning Peak Expiratory Flow Rate ( PEFR ) follow oral telithromycin treatment Secondary Objectives : The secondary objective study : - To evaluate microbial activity telithromycin exacerbation asthma : - Assessment patient 's clinical improvement relative initial C. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae status , - Analysis quantitative change baseline C. pneumonia M. pneumoniae culture quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) . - To evaluate safety 10 day oral telithromycin supplement standard care patient acute exacerbation asthma - To assess additional efficacy endpoint health outcome evaluation follow 10 day treatment either oral telithromycin placebo , either treatment use supplement standard care patient acute exacerbation asthma : - Changes daily variability PEFR 6 week study treatment , - Health status follow-up ( 6 week ) - Pulmonary function test : - Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) - Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) - Forced Expiratory Flow Rate ( FEF25-75 % ) - Need additional medication ( e.g. , inhaled corticosteroid , oral corticosteroid , bronchodilator use ) , - Time next acute exacerbation asthma .</brief_summary>
