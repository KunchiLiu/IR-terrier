	<brief_summary>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis ( MPGN ) relatively-rare , immune-mediated kidney disease . All current therapy inadequate MPGN frequently lead kidney failure . This study 10 patient trial monoclonal antibody rituximab adult patient MPGN . Study patient receive 2 dos rituximab intravenously day 1 15 follow 1 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis ( MPGN ) relatively-rare , immune-mediated glomerular disease . There accepted therapy current therapy inadequate . Current therapeutic option include immunosuppression corticosteroid alone combination alkylating agent , antiplatelet therapy aspirin and/or dipyridamole and/or warfarin , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin receptor blocker . As glomerular disease amount protein urine correlate well long-term prognosis . Thus , parameter use previous study , use study , primary indicator therapeutic efficacy . We propose pilot study test hypothesis selective B lymphocyte depletion result disappearance pathogenic antibody induce remission proteinuria patient idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis . Our population 10 adult MPGN involve either native kidney renal transplant . We enroll patient glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) great equal 25 ml/min , estimate creatinine clearance , 24 hour urinary ratio protein creatinine great equal 1 , receive angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) . Patients receive Rituximab 1g Day 1 15 . Patients follow 1 year follow completion treatment . The primary outcome change urinary protein excretion 6 month . Secondary outcome include change GFR , change urinary protein excretion 3 , 9 , 12 month , rate change urinary protein excretion , serum albumin concentration , serum cholesterol , number complete partial remission , time remission , number relapse .</detailed_description>
