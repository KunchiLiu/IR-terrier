	<brief_title>Phase II Safety Efficacy Study Single-agent AT-101 Patients With Relapsed Refractory B-cell Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , phase II study evaluate safety efficacy single-agent AT-101 patient relapse refractory B-cell malignancy . For purpose study , B-cell malignancy include one follow disease sub-types : follicular lymphoma ( FL ) , diffuse large b-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) , small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) /chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Patients enrol accord disease subtype one four group two stage . The first stage group enrol 13 patient . If patient within group experience disease response , additional 14 patient enrol group .</detailed_description>
