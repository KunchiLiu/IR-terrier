	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety , tolerability , establish maximum tolerate recommend dose ( RD ) CCI-779 ( temsirolimus ) cohorts patient vary degree hepatic dysfunction ( mild , moderate , severe ) order provide appropriate dosing recommendation CCI-779 ( temsirolimus ) population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile CCI-779 ( temsirolimus ) patient vary degree hepatic function . II . To determine pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile CCI-779 ( temsirolimus ) measure drug effect p70s6 kinase p4EBP1 phosphorylation marker mTOR inhibition peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) alter patient vary degree hepatic function . III . To document non-dose limit toxicity anti-tumor efficacy associate administration CCI-779 ( temsirolimus ) patient population . IV . To compare NCI ODWG criterion Child-Pugh classification hepatic dysfunction term predictive value reduce interpatient variability PK PD CCI-779 ( temsirolimus ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord hepatic function ( normal v mild dysfunction v moderate dysfunction v severe dysfunction v liver transplant ) . Patients receive temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos temsirolimus maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Up 12 patient treated MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 30 day .</detailed_description>
