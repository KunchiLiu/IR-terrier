	<brief_summary>Prostaglandins ( PG ) know alter regional ocular blood flow exhibit vasoactive property isolate ocular blood vessel . A variety animal experiment indicate endogenous PGs play role regulation retinal ( RBF ) choroidal ( ChBF ) blood flow . There also evidence prostaglandin pathway involved activation NO production human , however , mechanisms interaction PG NO ocular vasculature still unclear . Animal study suggest retinal choroidal blood flow decrease administration indomethacin ( nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor ) . More recently , show indomethacin inject intravenously decrease optic nerve oxygen tension reduce CO2 reactivity . This probably result decrease blood flow vasoconstriction vessel optic nerve . Systemic administration indomethacin also diminish cerebral , renal mesenteric blood flow unknown mechanism . However , clinical trial exist far investigate effect indomethacin ocular blood flow . Therefore , aim study investigate effect indomethacin ocular blood flow healthy human .</brief_summary>
