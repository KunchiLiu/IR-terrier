	<brief_summary>Community acquire pneumonia ( CAP ) common cause morbidity mortality . The diagnosis CAP microbiology perspective challenging . Recent report suggest utility real-time PCR rapid accurate diagnosis pathogen . Real-Time PCR test , use LightCycler instrument , perform excess additional specimen extraction nucleic acid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Excess patient specimen normally collect routine microbiologic test CAP case additional specimen ( i.e. , blood , urine , throat swab ) evaluate use real-time PCR test develop laboratory . Specimens perform patient suspect CAP . Test direct variety pathogen include limited M.pneumoniae , C. pneumoniae , Legionella pneumophila , Streptococcus pneumoniae , B. pertussis , influenza virus , adenovirus , metapneumovirus . The ultimate goal panel highly accurate rapid ( day ) test orderable perform short period time CAP case . Real-Time PCR test , use LightCycler instrument , perform excess additional specimen extraction nucleic acid . Real-time PCR test , use LightCycler instrument , perform excess additional specimen extraction nucleic acid . These test include organism list . As nucleic acid extract archive , pathogen test future develop additional real-time PCR test . All result obtain real-time PCR compare result conventional testing list . Sensitivity , specificity predictive value calculate . In case discordant result occur , additional PCR test medical history review conduct .</detailed_description>
