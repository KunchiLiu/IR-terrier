	<brief_summary>This multi-center , open label , randomize , 3-way cross-over study . 21 subject randomize receive three treatment one three treatment sequence . Patients risk CMV disease ( D+R- , D+R+ , D-R+ ) , treat prophylactically Valcyte® ( commercially available tablet ) , first second kidney transplant adequate renal hematological function eligible study . Screening may time transplantation provide follow-up procedure complete scheduled time prophylaxis . The first dose study drug may 1 14 day screen provided transplant stabilize , stable serum creatinine steady-state kinetics ganciclovir calcineurin inhibitor therapy attain . Follow-up take place 7- 14 day last dose study drug administration ; therefore duration study 5 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>WP16302 A Bioequivalence Study Comparing Ganciclovir From Valganciclovir Syrup Formulation Commercial Valganciclovir 450mg Tablet ( Valcyte® ) Dose 900mg Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient receive 900 mg Valcyte® daily food period specify center ( typically 100 day ) , start soon possible transplant . According routine practice , intravenous ganciclovir ( 5 mg/kg ) may substitute patient unable tolerate oral medication , time patient enrol study . The dose Valganciclovir may reduce interrupted discretion Investigator , , suspect ganciclovir-related toxicity occur , estimate creatinine clearance patient drop 60 ml/min For actual study , patient receive 2 day treatment consecutive day Valganciclovir syrup formulation ( 900 mg day . ) tablet formulation ( 900 mg day ) randomize order , continue Valcyte® prophylaxis ( commercially available tablet ) . The following three treatment administer study : Randomization occur IDS pharmacy computerized system randomize subject . Treatment A ( Reference ) : Valganciclovir tablets 2 x 450 mg day 2 day Treatment B ( Test ) : Valganciclovir tutti-frutti flavor syrup , 900 mg day 2 day Treatment C : ( First formulation ) Valganciclovir strawberry flavor syrup , 900 mg day 2 day All formulation administer orally within 15 minute completion standard breakfast ( 400-800 kcal ) . Patients see GCRC ( General Clinic Research Center ) 8th floor Montefiore Hospital study visit except follow-up . This visit take place Infectious Disease Clinic , 7th floor Falk Clinic . Screening : A screening examination perform 1 14 day start study ( day first dose study drug ) . Patients fulfill inclusion none exclusion criterion accept study . Patients fail renal hematological function criterion may re-screened parameter improve still treat Valcyte® . The following procedure perform establish patient 's general health eligibility enrollment study : Record medical history , include etiology end-stage organ disease , detail transplant ( date type ) , previous disease ( include CMV ) treatment , immunosuppressive drug dos within previous month transplantation , whichever short , Record CMV serology donor recipient. , perform physical examination ; record demographic information include sex , age race/ethnicity ; Obtain vital sign , height weight ; Draw blood sample laboratory screen hematology ( one teaspoon blood ) routine serum chemistry , include calculation estimate creatinine clearance ; Obtain mid-stream urine sample urinalysis pregnancy test ( female ) . This visit take 30 minute . Patient see hospital research coordinator research physician , recover kidney transplant procedure . Day 1 Patients come GCRC evening , morning Day 1 , within 14 day screen . The following procedure carry patient : - Assessment patient stable calcineurin inhibitor Valganciclovir therapy ( ≥ 4 day ) ; assignment patient identification number ; physical examination ; concomitant medication since last visit collect ; vital sign weight ; blood sample hematology serum chemistry ( 5 cc ) ; mid-stream sample urine urinalysis pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential ) ; breakfast . - Study drug administer ( either two Valganciclovir tablet 900 mg ( 18 mL ) syrup formulation Valganciclovir ) breakfast ( must within 15 minute completion breakfast ) . Adverse event concomitant medication record . Patients may discharge dose . This visit take 2-3 hour complete . Days 2 , 4 6 Patients return GCRC morning day . The following procedure carry patient : - Pre-dose PK blood sample determination trough level ganciclovir ( 5cc ) - Breakfast start within 15 minute pre-dose PK blood sample . The study drug ( either two Valganciclovir tablet 900 mg ( 18 mL ) syrup formulation Valganciclovir ) administer breakfast ( must within 15 minute completion breakfast ) . - The following procedure carry dose : pharmacokinetic blood sample ( total blood collect day 11cc ) determination plasma level ganciclovir 0.5 , 0.75 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 6.0 , 8.0 , 12 hour post-dose ( time windows ± 5 minute allow sample 4 hour ± 20 minute sample 6 12 hour ) - Adverse event concomitant medication document . Patients may discharge 12-hour sample . This day take twelve -thirteen hour complete . Days 3 5 Patients return GCRC morning . The following procedure carry patient : - Vital sign weight ; 24 hour PK blood sample ( ± 30 minute ) determination trough level ganciclovir dose next formulation study drug ( 1cc ) ; Breakfast start within 15 minute pre-dose PK blood sample . - Study drug administer ( either two Valganciclovir tablet 900 mg ( 18 mL ) syrup formulation Valganciclovir ) breakfast ( must within 15 minute completion breakfast ) . Adverse event concomitant medication record . Patients may discharge dose . This visit take 2-3 hour complete . Day 7 Patients return GCRC morning . The following procedure carry patient : - Blood sample hematology serum chemistry ( 5cc ) ; mid-stream sample urine urinalysis ; 24 hour PK blood sample ( ± 30 minute ) determination trough level ganciclovir dose ( 5cc ) . Breakfast start within 15 minute pre-dose PK blood sample . - Two Valcyte® tablet administer ( supply center ) breakfast ( must within 15 minute completion breakfast ) . Adverse event concomitant medication record patient may discharge GCRC . This visit take 2-3 hour complete . During Study The following safety assessment make throughout study , screen follow-up , applicable : adverse event ( AE 's ) , include rejection graft loss , opportunistic infection ( CMV others ) treatment ; concomitant treatment , include immunosuppressive therapy ( induction , maintenance treatment rejection ) patient survival document . Follow-up Phase Patients return Days 13 20 follow-up . The follow-up procedure include physical examination , body weight , vital sign , clinical laboratory safety test ( hematology , serum chemistry urinalysis ) ( 5cc ) , urine pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential ) record adverse event concomitant medication . Once visit complete patient complete study . This visit take one hour complete .</detailed_description>
