	<brief_summary>Decoy receptor 3 ( DcR3 ) , new member tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) superfamily , decoy receptor FasL could inhibit FasL-induced apoptosis , recently show induce costimulation T cell . Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) autoimmune disease pathogenic autoantibody immune complex result abnormal immune response include T B lymphocyte hyperactivity , formation pathogenic subset autoantibody . Rhematoid arthritis ( RA ) multi-systemic autoimmune disease characterize persistent inflammatory synovitis . Activated T lymphocytes infiltration synovium strongly correlate symptom . DcR3 mRNA express peripheral-blood T cell up-regulated antigenic stimulation . The DcR3 gene demonstrate overexpressed patient sclerosis SLE ; however , role DcR3 SLE RA well effect DcR3 T cell immune response still clear . This study investigate role DcR3-induced T cell activation SLE RA . The genetic polymorphism DcR3 association SLE RA study elucidate genetic factor associate development SLE RA . For explore possible molecular mechanism elevate DcR3 association SLE , attempt study whether DcR3 could induce T cell activation via costimualtion and/or inhibit activation induce cell death ( AICD ) activate T cell SLE RA . This study provide new direction therapy reverse T cell hyper-reactivity SLE RA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 . Study DcR3-induced T cell activation SLE RA . A . Patients control Patients SLE RA Department Internal Medicine , National Taiwan University Hospital study . All patient meet criterion American College Rheumatologists diagnosis SLE RA . As control , 20 healthy age- gender-matched volunteer use . All study include sample involve human accordance institutional guideline . B . Detection serum DcR3 protein SLE RA patient C. T cell proliferation assay Specific Aim 2 . Study effect DcR3 activation-induced cell death ( AICD ) SLE RA In order understand whether DcR3 could reduce AICD activate T cell SLE RA patient , T cell patient assay AICD presence absence soluble DcR3-Fc . Specific Aim 3 . To investigate association clinical manifestation SLE RA genetic polymorphism DcR3 gene . A . The gene sequence single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis DcR3 gene . B . The association clinical manifestation SLE RA genetic polymorphism DcR3 gene .</detailed_description>
