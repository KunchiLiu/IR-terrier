	<brief_summary>This study aim understand biological process link obesity disease include insulin resistance diabetes . Our approach involve study health patient undergo weight loss either via weight reduction surgery medically supervise liquid formula diet . Patients must enrol weight treatment program Emory Bariatrics , Emory University , Atlanta GA , eligible study . This study cover cost treatment Emory Bariatrics . The hypothesis decrease adipose-tissue derived factor weight loss relate improvement insulin function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance Severely Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe obesity affect 4.7 % U.S. population . A significant number individual suffer impaired glucose tolerance type II diabetes due insulin resistance ( IR ) . Although generally accept accumulation intraabdominal ( IA ) fat increase risk develop IR , mechanisms responsible phenomenon yet understood . In addition , role subcutaneous ( SC ) fat towards etiology IR - protective , inert detrimental - still debate . This SC adipose tissue release adipocytokines ( IL-6 , leptin , TNF- ) demonstrate impair insulin action . In individual severely obese , hyperinsulinemia may induce exaggerated production adipocytokines IA compare SC fat store . Our specific aim : ( 1 ) determine relative contribution abdominal SC fat versus IA fat systemic level IL-6 , leptin TNF- lean severely obese individual ; ( 2 ) determine effect systemic adipocytokine concentration whole body well tissue sensitivity insulin . Hypothesis : ( ) In context severe obesity , IA fat produce increase quantity IL-6 , leptin TNF- compare SC fat ; ( b ) In severely obese patient undergo weight loss , whole body tissue IR predict change systemic adipocytokines . Methods : Adipose tissue content IL-6 , leptin TNF- determine ELISA biopsy obtain IA SC fat store lean severely obese patient . Computer tomography-determined area IA SC fat relate change systemic adipocytokines baseline 6-mo follow weight loss therapy . Changes systemic IL-6 , leptin TNF- assess measurement make baseline follow 6-mo weight loss . For time period also determine change whole body ( via IVGTT ) tissue sensitivity insulin ( via glucose uptake muscle fat ) . Relationships systemic adipocytokines IR assess use uni- multivariate correlation analysis . These novel study determine whether hypersecretion adipocytokines IA versus SC adipose tissue induces IR patient severe obesity .</detailed_description>
