	<detailed_description>The following variable follow : time location positive culture , underlie disease severity illness , recent immunomodulative therapy , physical exam finding , laboratory radiographical data , antimicrobial usage onset infection , microbiological data resistance pattern , choice antibiotic organism identify , suspect source infection , bacteriological outcome , laboratory result , demographic information , medication , clinical outcome gender , height , weight , ethnicity , past medical history . The following variable follow : time location positive culture , underlie disease severity illness , recent immunomodulative therapy , physical exam finding , laboratory radiographical data , antimicrobial usage onset infection , microbiological data resistance pattern , choice antibiotic organism identify , suspect source infection , bacteriological outcome , laboratory result , demographic information , medication , clinical outcome gender , height , weight , ethnicity , past medical history . The bacteria patient 's culture subcultured ( diagnosis obtain since microbiology lab would otherwise destroy culture ) provide honest broker deidentify specimen link medical information collect ( also deidentified honest broker ) . Patient data enter database honest broker use excel program electronic data capture reporting system . The honest broker access database ensure data integrity perform data analysis . In addition , Honest Broker obtain information medical record well information specimen . The research team access database deidentified . The following evaluation perform bacteria . The minimal inhibitory concentration antibiotic use treatment perform E-Test method ( AB Biodisk , Solna , Sweden ) . Specific mechanisms antimicrobial resistance study emphasis molecular mechanism antibiotic resistance production beta-lactamase . This evaluation perform analytical isoelectric focus technique well PCR gene sequence analysis determine gene encode beta-lactamase . Biologic sample control principal investigator research project . All sample provide investigator deidentified honest broker cod number . The information link code number correspond subject ' identity keep separate , secure location honest broker access . The investigator study keep sample indefinitely . Samples keep investigator 's laboratory locate Scaife Hall , room 812 , 3500 Terrace Street . At time research investigator access patient identifier .</detailed_description>
