	<detailed_description>Musculoskeletal condition lead cause disability United States account 130 million patient visit healthcare provider annually . Rotator cuff tear one common cause pain disability upper extremity . Impaired motor control shoulder girdle muscle concomitant instability often exist prior surgical procedure . Re-tears and/or attenuation rotator cuff repair occur relatively frequently may compromise functional result . Loading UE rehabilitation , thus repair site , follow surgical procedure implicate complication Conventional shoulder rehabilitation protocols human-human interface posse ability systematically quantify dose progression patient subacute stage thus , potentially overload repair site . No evidence-based research exist compare outcome specific rehabilitative training protocol post-surgical patient . Consensus statement conclude , �a need clinical trial , validate outcome measure essential� . Advances robotics technology offer unprecedented opportunity improve rehabilitation pathway , technology focus primarily neurological disease . The MIT Newman Laboratory Biomechanics Human Rehabilitation upper extremity ( UE ) robot impedance control , back-drivable , oblique-vertical vertical robot design safely exert control , grade force move guide limb , function passive , active-assistive , active resistive mode , provide objective data motion . A major advantage capacity real-time , grade change base patient input , provide stability random perturbation , increase withdraw assistance allow dose-specific treatment . The vertical robot device show safe well tolerate without adverse effect shoulder pain . Goal-directed , quantifiable rehabilitation protocol redevelopment function improve range motion , strength motor control lack patient musculoskeletal impairment . The successful robotic-assisted rehabilitation acute chronic , severe impairment provide impetus apply technology UE musculoskeletal impairment . The ability objectively control measure dose progression rehabilitation process valuable tool advancement evidence�based rehabilitation intervention The propose pilot clinical trial determine 8-weeks robotic rehabilitation improve rate quality recovery range motion , strength , function follow rotator cuff repair compare conventional physical therapy rehabilitation protocol .</detailed_description>
