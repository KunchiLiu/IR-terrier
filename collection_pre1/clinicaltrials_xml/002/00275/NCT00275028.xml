	<brief_title>AZD2171 Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian , Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy AZD2171 platinum sensitive platinum insensitive disease , base either RECIST criterion ( patient measurable cancer radiographically ) clinical response benefit ( modify Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup [ GCIG ] CA-125 response stable disease least 16 week ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression-free survival . II . To assess modified GCIG CA-125 response rate . III . To assess duration modify GCIG CA-125 response . IV . To assess safety recommend phase 2 dose AZD2171 asymptomatic patient population . V. To explore pharmacodynamic effect AZD2171 correlate clinical outcome angiogenic profile derive serial assessment soluble VEGFR2 , circulate endothelial cell level , VEGFR phosphorylation circulate endothelial cell . VI . To explore pharmacogenetic difference kdr/flk-1 , HIF1alpha , p53 , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) PBMCs subject consent separately pharmacogenetic study . VII . To determine whether oncogenic mutation predict response AZD2171 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease sensitivity ( platinum-sensitive disease v platinum-insensitive disease ) . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 71 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
