	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Using Pegasys Copegus Recipients Liver Transplantation With Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , prospective , randomize , open-label efficacy safety study . The study do see whether treatment use Pegasys ( pegylated interferon alfa-2a ) Copegus ( ribavirin ) safer effective liver transplant recipient give hepatitis C infection reappears , give clinical symptom hepatitis C reinfection appear . The study also do liver transplant recipient estimate much hepatitis C detect time , body affect study drug , safety study drug whether study drug effect participant ' quality life , whether participant feel less depressed result . Participants put one two group . In preventive group ; participant receive study drug treatment recur ( return ) hepatitis C develop actual clinical symptom . The participant observational group receive study drug treatment recur hepatitis C develop clinical symptom hepatitis c infection . This study four part : screening phrase , treatment/observational phrase , follow-up phase long term safety follow-up phase . Throughout four stage study , participant physical exam , medical surgical history 's take , blood urine test , eye exam , liver biopsy , chest x-ray electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . If participant female , pregnancy test also perform . Participants must also agree drink alcoholic beverage take drug hepatitis c infection take part study .
