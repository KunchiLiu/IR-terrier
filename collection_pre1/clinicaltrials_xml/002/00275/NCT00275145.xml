	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Substantial evidence support favorable relationship cardiovascular fitness , physical activity , cardiovascular health . In particular , well establish increase level physical activity result favorable improvement lipid carbohydrate metabolism . There also evidence increase physical activity cardiovascular fitness beneficial effect cardiovascular health , independent effect specific cardiovascular risk factor . One hypothesis propose beneficial effect regular exercise human mediate peripheral mechanism , particular chronic adaptation skeletal muscle habitual exercise . The exercise exposure require achieve health benefit poorly define mechanisms beneficial adaptation occur poorly understood . This study investigate peripheral biological mechanism chronic physical activity alters carbohydrate metabolism lipid metabolism , result improvement parameter cardiovascular health fitness . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In Studies Targeted Risk Reduction Intervention Defined Exercise II ( STRRIDE II ) , participant randomly assign one four exercise training regimens 4-month sedentary control period . After initial ramp period 2 month , participant ask train 6 month give exercise program . The program differ either dose aerobic exercise mode ( e.g. , aerobic exercise , resistance exercise , combination ) . Parameters reflect change carbohydrate lipid metabolism study integrative physiologic level measurable biological endpoint peripheral skeletal muscle ( capillary surface area ) . It propose elucidation peripheral mechanism mediate favorable response carbohydrate lipid metabolism chronic physical activity lead well understanding health benefit confer physical activity cardiovascular fitness . This may also point way toward good exercise recommendation client significant cardiovascular risk factor . The purpose study investigate peripheral biological mechanism chronic physical activity alter carbohydrate metabolism lipid metabolism result improvement parameter cardiovascular health fitness . The drive hypothesis health benefit derive habitual exercise primarily mediate adaptation occur skeletal muscle . The mechanism change skeletal muscle differs mode exercise training . It hypothesize health benefit aerobic exercise mediate primarily qualitative change skeletal muscle ( alteration expose capillary surface area skeletal muscle induce exercise train ) health benefit resistance exercise mediate primarily quantitative change skeletal muscle ( alteration fiber area skeletal muscle induce exercise train ) . The investigator use combination exercise regimens moderately obese patient mild moderate lipid metabolic abnormality order investigate whether induced alteration skeletal muscle fiber area , metabolic capacity , capillary surface area account favorable alteration insulin sensitivity , glucose metabolism , lipoprotein level , lipid metabolism .</detailed_description>
