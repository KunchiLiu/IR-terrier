	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) cause wide spectrum liver disease , fulminant acute hepatitis , chronic hepatitis , liver cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma . The number individual infect virus estimate high 350 million . Thus , addition global hepatitis B vaccination , effective treatment chronic hepatitis B also need . Currently , effective antiviral treatment cure HBV infection patient chronic hepatitis B . Five drug approve treatment chronic hepatitis B present : conventional interferon ( IFN ) alpha , lamivudine , adefovir dipivoxil , pegylated IFN alpha recently entecavir . Conventional IFN alpha monotherapy narrow range efficacy . Lamivudine , relatively cheap , well tolerate , show effective patient hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) -positive -negative chronic hepatitis B . However , virologic response lamivudine durable occur spontaneously induce IFN treatment . In addition , prolonged lamivudine treatment commonly associate emergence drug-resistance HBV mutant accompany development breakthrough hepatitis . Adefovir potent approve treatment chronic hepatitis B several country , nephrotoxic daily dose high 10 mg still available widely . Entecavir , carbocyclic deoxyguanosine analog , active lamivudine- adefovir dipivoxil-resistant HBV , potent anti-HBV agent ever discovered,11 however , long-term efficacy remain evaluate . Pegylated IFN alpha recently show superior conventional IFN alpha lamivudine , also approve treatment chronic hepatitis B . Overall , satisfactory virologic serologic response could achieve use pegylated IFN alpha alone around 30-44 % patient . Nevertheless , well treatment option still need remain &gt; 50 % non-responders .
