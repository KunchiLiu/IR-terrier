	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylori major human pathogen infects half world population . Infection initiate series change gastric mucosa , begin gastritis lead patient peptic ulcer disease , mucosa-associated lymphoma , gastric adenocarcinoma . It believe host factor , particular , T cell-mediated immune response may play important role pathogenesis disease induce H. pylori infection . Recent result reveal high IFN-γ secreting cell gastric infiltrate T cell isolate H. pylorus infect patient uninfected patient , suggest TH1 response degree IFN-γ production associate disease severity . Meanwhile , recent study show apoptosis gastric epithelium increase infection response associate expansion gastric T-helper type 1 ( Th1 ) cell . In project , try investigate role host T cell mediate immune response pathogenesis Helicobacter infection characterization expression chemokine receptor gastric infiltrate lymphocyte . We go investigate mechanism involve chemokine/chemokine receptor interaction recruitment gastric infiltrating lymphocytes pathogenesis gastric mucosa damage Helicobacter infection . This study helpful understanding mechanism activation recruitment gastric-infiltrating lymphocyte gastric inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim # 1 : Characterization gastric infiltrate T cell H. pylori gastritis patient A . Patients H. pylori infect gastritis asymptomatic patient select National Taiwan University hospital . The gastric biopsy specimen take endoscopic biopsy routine health check panendoscopic examination despeptic patient . HP negative gastritis patient also study negative control . B. Immunohistochemical identification T cell expression chemokine receptor . Specific Aim # 2 . Isolation characterization chemokines chemokine receptor infiltrate lymphocyte H. pylori-associated gastritis tissue A . Isolation gastric infiltrate lymphocyte B . Identification expression chemokine receptor gastric infiltrating lymphocyte flow cytometry C. Detection expression chemokines gastric tissue</detailed_description>
