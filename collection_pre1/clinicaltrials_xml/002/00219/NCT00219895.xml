	<brief_summary>Specific Aim : To determine whether neutrophil , active elastase , cytokine measure sputum induce use hypertonic saline useful screening test determine particular agent know anti-inflammatory property suitable candidate extensive clinical trial patient CF . This aim address use anti-inflammatory agent , ibuprofen , show clinical benefit CF . A `` treatment '' arm include control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Inflammatory Mediators ( AIM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammation clearly contribute progression cystic fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease . Anti-inflammatory therapy alternate-day corticosteroid twice-daily high-dose ibuprofen patient CF show clinical benefit , adverse effect consideration markedly limit use . Therefore , alternative anti-inflammatory agent urgently need . Results clinical trial alternate-day corticosteroid high-dose ibuprofen CF indicate anti-inflammatory therapy probably result improvement pulmonary function , slow rate decline . This expectation impose constraint design study test new anti-inflammatory agent , require use many patient considerable period time ( year , rather month necessary evaluate anti-infective anti-obstructive therapy ) . Thus , highly desirable design strategy evaluation prospective anti-inflammatory agent allow selection promise agent study Phase III type trial . Of additional concern fact pharmaceutical firm pursue development anti-inflammatory agent CF early indicator efficacy . This present insurmountable hurdle translation research advance clinical treatment . Some mean screen candidate drug urgently require . This study assess measurement inflammatory mediator induce sputum one strategy . The hypothesis test ibuprofen reduce neutrophil , active elastase , pro-inflammatory cytokine induce sputum 4 week therapy patient CF .</detailed_description>
