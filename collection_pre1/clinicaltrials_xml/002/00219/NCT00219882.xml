	<brief_title>Safety Study Orally Administered Curcuminoids Adult Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug substance study curcumin . Curcumin ( diferuloylmethane ) major constituent spice turmeric , use food worldwide . The pharmacologic rationale study curcumin treatment cystic fibrosis potential curcumin help correct deficiency cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( CFTR ) protein . Cystic fibrosis result mutation CFTR gene , produce abnormal CFTR protein properly transport chloride ion water lung lead abnormal mucus production . Curcumin potent inhibitor endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) Ca2+ pump , lower ER calcium concentration . This may allow abnormal CFTR protein function properly chloride channel correct cystic fibrosis defect . If successful , effect could measure decrease nasal potential difference ( NPD ) sweat chloride cystic fibrosis patient . The primary objective study assess safety advance dos curcuminoids administer orally fourteen consecutive day adult subject cystic fibrosis ( CF ) homozygous ΔF508 CFTR . The secondary objective obtain pharmacokinetic data oral curcumoniods CF subject assess effectiveness curcuminoids alter nasal potential difference ( NPD ) seat chloride concentration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female 18 40 year age . Documented history homozygous ΔF508 CFTR genotype . Able perform spirometry maneuver , force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) great equal 30 % predict normal age , gender , height ( Knudson standard ) screening . Oxygen saturation ( measure pulse oximetry ) &gt; 90 % room air screen . Clinically stable evidence acute upper low respiratory tract infection . Nonsmoker least 6 month prior screen . Able understand sign write informed consent comply requirement study . Diagnosis acute pulmonary exacerbation ( PE ) require antibiotic intervention within 4 week prior screen . Patient report history viral upper respiratory tract infection within 2 week prior screen . History major complication lung disease ( include recent massive hemoptysis pneumothorax ) within two month prior screen Visit . Acute nosebleed within 14 day prior screen . Nasal surgery within 4 week prior screen . Begun use nasal antibiotic , nasal steroid , nasal cromolyn , nasal atrovent , nasal phenylephrine , oxymetazoline within 14 day prior screen . Chest xray screen within 3 month screen abnormality suggest clinically significant active pulmonary disease cystic fibrosis , and/or new CFspecific change include atelectasis , small pneumothoraces , pneumonia . EKG screening show clinically significant abnormality include prolonged QTc , bundle branch block , rhythm sinus , evidence ischemic heart disease .</criteria>
