	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether dispatcher-assisted CPR instruction compression ventilation versus dispatcher-assisted CPR instruction compression improves survival out-of-hospital cardiac arrest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dispatcher-Assisted Resuscitation Trial ( DART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , condition characterize person suddenly collapse due heart stoppage , lead cause death United States . In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , survival dependent upon American Heart Association term chain survival include quick activation 9-1-1 system , prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , early defibrillation , qualify advanced life support care ( paramedic care ) . CPR allow circulation delivery oxygen vital organ heart longer beating . However , instance , citizen bystander train CPR , present circumstance cardiac arrest victim may receive CPR arrival emergency medical service ( EMS ) personnel ( i.e. , paramedic ) . The delay CPR adversely affect outcome dcreases chance survival . In response need , EMS Division Public Health - Seattle King County develop instituted telephone CPR instruction could provide `` on-the-spot '' cardiac arrest emergency medical ( 9-1-1 ) dispatcher . The instruction design give phone person previous CPR training initiate CPR prior arrival EMS personnel term `` dispatcher-assisted '' CPR . The dispatcher instruction provide dispatch agency King County include standard `` full '' CPR protocol ventilation ( breathe victim 's mouth inflate lung ) chest compression ( pump patient chest help circulate blood ) . The ventilation oxygenate blood chest compression pump oxygenate blood forward . This EMS program lead considerable increase proportion cardiac arrest victim King County receive citizen bystander CPR prior EMS arrival associate improved survival ( appendix 1 ) . Comparison : Dispatcher-assisted CPR instruction compression ventillations compare dispatcher-assisted CPR instruction compression .</detailed_description>
