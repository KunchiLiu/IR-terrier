	<detailed_description>Disorders defecation common process defecation remain poorly describe . This result limit approach treatment patient , limited success . This study simultaneously measure multiple component process defecation - abdominal wall perineal muscle activity , pressure within rectum anal canal change shape anorectal region colon , order develop biomechanical model describe normal abnormal defecatory process . It anticipate , understand process term allow new approach categorize describe defecation problem turn lead specific approach treatment tailor individual patient . These parameter compare volunteer defecatory disorder patient defecatory disorder refer defecography part clinical evaluation .</detailed_description>
