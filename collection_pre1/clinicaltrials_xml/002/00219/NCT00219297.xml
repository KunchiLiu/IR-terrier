	<criteria>World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status 0 , 1 2 ( correspond Karnofsky performance status 50 good ) Patients radiologically proven ( gadoliniumenhanced [ Gd ] magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) parenchymal brain metastasis histologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer ( primary disease may quiescent ) . GdMRI must perform within 2 week study entry . Patients least one bidimensionally measurable intracranial lesion minimum 2 cm define GdMRI . If patient previous radiation marker lesion ( ) , must evidence residual disease &gt; 2 cm lesion must demonstrate progression since radiation . Those patient progress radiotherapy must 25 % increase size previously radiate intracranial lesion base NeuroOncology Criteria Tumor Response Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Tumors appearance new lesion . Patients must control medication neurologically stable : stable steroid anticonvulsant least 2 week prior obtain baseline GdMRI brain , and/or least 2 week prior begin study treatment . Female patient must negative serum pregnancy test screening . ( Not applicable patient bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy patient postmenopausal . ) All patient reproductive potential must agree use effective method contraception study three month follow termination treatment . Written informed consent must obtain . Clinical evidence leptomeningeal disease Patients extracranial disease 3 organ site include primary tumor . Patients receive investigational compound within past 28 day plan receive investigational drug participate study Prior administration epothilone ( ) Patients peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 Patients unresolved diarrhea within last 7 day treatment . Patients receive know diarrheogenic agent must stop treatment agent prior enrollment study . Radiotherapy &lt; 3 week prior study entry Prior intracranial surgery &lt; 3 week prior study entry ; patient must recover surgery prior study entry . Chemotherapy &lt; 3 week prior study entry ; &lt; 6 week prior nitrosoureas . Severe cardiac insufficiency ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] III IV ) , uncontrolled and/or unstable cardiac coronary artery disease Radiotherapy permit study . Exception : palliative radiotherapy metastasis extremity allow , lesion use target nontarget lesion . Patients receive hematopoietic growth factor except erythropoietin Patients take Coumadin® agent contain warfarin , exception low dose Coumadin® ( 1 mg less daily ) administer prophylactically maintenance indwell line port</criteria>
