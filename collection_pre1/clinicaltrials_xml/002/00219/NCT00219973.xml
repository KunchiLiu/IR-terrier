	<brief_title>CANBESURE STUDY ( Cancer , Bemiparin Surgery Evaluation )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although efficacy low-molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH ) prophylaxis postoperative venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) well establish large number study , aspect remain determined . The optimal duration prophylactic treatment clearly define yet . Traditionally , surgical prophylaxis VTE patient undergo high-risk orthopaedic surgery extend one two week operation . However , recent study carry field demonstrate prolongation prophylaxis LMWH 4-6 week significantly reduce incidence VTE ( half ) patient undergo orthopaedic surgery high-risk VTE . On contrary , thromboprophylaxis oncological surgery generally limited period hospitalisation , despite fact activation coagulation great prolonged patient undergo surgery neoplastic process patient affected cancer . The two study carry evaluate efficacy prolongation thromboprophylaxis 4 week type surgery seem indicate VTE incidence could reduce even one-week prophylaxis , though allow establish definitive conclusion . The present study aim evaluate efficacy safety Bemiparin , second-generation LMWH , prophylaxis VTE ( use postoperative regimen , give first dose 6 hour finish surgical procedure ) 28 day compare 8 day , oncological surgery . Additionally , exploratory analysis carry evaluate : 1 . The biological effect sc . administration Bemiparin ( 3,500 IU/day ) different biological marker involve tumoral development metastasis patient undergoing oncological abdominal pelvic surgical operation . 2 . The effect sc . administration Bemiparin ( 3,500 IU/day ) evolution tumour patient undergoing oncological abdominal pelvic surgical operation . 3 . The effect sc . administration Bemiparin ( 3,500 IU/day ) survival patient 6 month operation . Four Study Committees create clinical trial order guarantee safety patient well high quality data : - Trial Steering Committee - Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board - Committee Evaluation Phlebographies - Committee Adjudicating Clinical Events .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 40 year age old , either sex , give informed consent participate study . Patients malignant neoplastic process ( primary metastasic ) gastrointestinal tract ( except oesophagus ) , genitourinary tract female reproductive organ , previously diagnose document , program undergo elective , open , curative palliative surgery directly relate disease . Patients undergo surgery general spinal anaesthesia , estimate duration surgery 30 minute . Patients life expectancy least 3 month . Curative palliative surgery malignant neoplastic process liver , biliary tract pancreas . Women pregnant breastfeeding , woman childbearing potential use effective contraceptive method . Patients macrohaematuria , active haemorrhage within past two month , organ lesion risk bleeding ( e.g . active peptic ulcer , haemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident , aneurysm ) , history episode clinically evident haemorrhage , major surgery previous month increase risk bleed due disturbance haemostasis would contraindicate anticoagulant therapy , exception bleeding episodes directly cause tumour subject surgical intervention . Patients know hypersensitivity LMWHs , heparin substance porcine origin . Patients know hypersensitivity radiological contrast medium . Patients know hypersensitivity anaesthetic drug preanaesthetic drug . Patients congenital acquire bleeding diathesis ( confirmed hematological test ) , without haematuria . Lesions surgical intervention central nervous system , eye ear within previous 6 month , include hemorrhagic ischemic cerebrovascular accident , cerebral thrombosis and/or know cerebral metastasis . Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation ( DIC ) attributable heparininduced thrombocytopenia . Acute bacterial endocarditis slow endocarditis . Patients treatment oral parenteral anticoagulant within 5 day operation . Patients history thrombocytopenia associate heparin current platelet count &lt; 75,000/mm3 . Patients renal failure ( define serum creatinine 2 mg/dL ) , hepatic insufficiency ( AST and/or ALT value &gt; 5 time normal value establish reference range local laboratory hospital ) . Severe arterial hypertension ( systolic blood pressure 200 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 120 mmHg ) . One document episode DVT and/or PE ( confirm ventilationperfusion gamma scan helical CT ) previous 3 month . Patients suspect confirmed inability comply study treatment and/or followup . Patients participate another clinical trial do past 30 day . Patients cava vein filter place . Patients need use unallowed concomitant treatment medication 125mg/day aspirin , NSAIDs long halflife significant antiaggregation activity , metformin , anticoagulant compound ( please refer section protocol `` Concomitant medication treatment '' detail )</criteria>
