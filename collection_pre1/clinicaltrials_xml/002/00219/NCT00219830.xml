	<brief_title>A Trial Home Based Walking Program Alternate Program Non Attenders Cardiac Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) important cause life year lose Northern Ireland ( NI ) . A recently update Cochrane review ( Joliffe et al , 2003 ) confirm finding earlier meta-analyses ( O'Connor et al , 1989 ; Oldridge et al , 1988 ) indicate participation cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) reduce mortality MI . The early work demonstrate reduction 20-25 % all-cause cardiac mortality . The recent work allow analysis increase number patient ( 8440 32 trial ) report reduction total cardiac mortality 31 % . Participation CR MI also improve well-being reduces disability ( NHS , 1998 ) . However , informal report suggest approximately 50 % patient actually attend hospital base program . The hypothesis test chose attend formal CR , home-based walk program acceptable alternative . This programme work entails two separate study design . To evaluate home-based walk program , plan randomise controlled trial ( RCT ) . Randomisation subject study group follow determination eligibility participate . Participants randomise experimental group ask walk 30 minute , 5-days per week . They request record aspect walk diary , include time , intensity number step take ( record use pedometer ) . Qualitative methodology use semi-structured interview use explore experience allocate intervention group . The attitude experience non-attenders CR decline participate trial explore focus group . Three focus group contain 8 participant plan . Focus group transcript analyse independently two observer use computer program ( NUDIST ) identify theme develop question semi-structured interview . Analysis semi-structured interview descriptive , response categorise theme appropriate . RCT result analyse intention treat .</detailed_description>
