	<brief_title>At-Home Automated External Defibrillator ( AED ) Training Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past 3 decade , advance understand resuscitation cardiac arrest provide opportunity strengthen link chain survival . Despite apparent progress , however , survival remain poor . Cardiac arrest lead cause mortality US , account 450,000 death annually . Eighty percent cardiac arrest event cause arrhythmia , ventricular fibrillation . Prompt electrical defibrillation effective therapy . The time interval collapse attempt defibrillation important determinant outcome . The chance survival decrease average approximately 10-15 % every minute elapse prior attempt defibrillation . Thus , method decrease time interval collapse electrical defibrillation represent true opportunity improve survival cardiac arrest . Even community emergency medical system best situate treat cardiac arrest , response interval average great 6 minute . The development automate external defibrillator ( AED ) provide possibility decrease interval collapse defibrillation enable person outside traditional emergency medical service response system typically trained rhythm recognition deliver life-saving therapy . The AED device apply case cardiac arrest assess heart rhythm instruct bystander whether provide shock . In addition , approximately 75 % cardiac arrest occur home witness find family member . Thus , family responder AED program , family member person relatively high risk cardiac arrest equip trained AEDs , may part , decrease interval collapse shock cardiac arrest improve outcome . Persons recently hospitalize acute coronary syndrome know elevate risk cardiac arrest . Indeed , provision AED home use already practice . However , clear method use train family member potentially lifesaving set skill . The purpose propose study evaluate 4 different AED training method determine train approach differentially affect AED skill retention psychological status . Although program span spectrum streamline personalized intensive , approach constitute potential real-world , generalizable AED training method .</detailed_description>
