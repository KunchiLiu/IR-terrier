	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine ability Protector Cap Jet Injector prevent cross-contamination next injection sample . The hypothesis Protector Cap Jet Injector prevent contamination next injection sample , even follow injection volunteer high level hepatitis B virus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Safety Study Determine Ability Protector Cap Jet Injector Prevent Cross-Contamination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The jet injector needle-free injection device use high-pressure stream penetrate skin deliver medication intradermal , subcutaneous , intramuscular tissue . Multi-dose jet injector type jet injector reusable fluid path consist vial adapter , dose chamber , fluid pathway , nozzle . Although credited decade use delivery million dose vaccine field , multi-dose jet injector longer use due evidence cross-contamination injection . The HSI-500 Jet Injector Protector Cap design disposable plastic cap act shield nozzle skin eliminate cross-contamination injection maintain high rate vaccine delivery multiple patient . The objective pilot safety study provide preliminary indication ability jet injector prevent cross-contamination hepatitis B virus volunteer injection . A secondary objective study test study procedure prior larger-scale safety study .</detailed_description>
