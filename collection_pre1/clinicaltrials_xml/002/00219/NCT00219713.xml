	<brief_summary>Bone marrow biopsy painful medical procedure often perform local anesthetic . Therefore double-blind , randomize , control trial carry 330 adult patient refer bone marrow biopsy aspiration . 164 assigned inhale equimolar mixture nitrous oxide oxygen 166 inhale placebo . Pain measurement use visual-analogue pain scale , involve rating intensity pain horizontal ruler</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Pain Intensity During Bone Marrow Biopsy Performed With Inhalation Pre-Mixed 50 Per Cent Nitrous Oxide Oxygen Mixture .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy inhale equimolar mixture nitrous oxide oxygen prevent procedural pain lumbar puncture child demonstrate . In adult use inhaled equimolar mixture could prevent pain . Although nitrous oxide initially consider innocuous , evidence begin gather later potentially side effect . It demonstrate nitrous oxide inactivates vitamin B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthetase impair DNA synthesis bone marrow cell . Therefore prospective , multicenter randomize placebo control , double-blind trial design determine whether inhaled equimolar mixture nitrous oxide oxygen would significantly reduce pain bone marrow biopsy aspiration . In addition perform careful cytological examination bone marrow sample order evaluate quality picture sample .</detailed_description>
