	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure specific chemokines , antibody , antibody-producing B cell blood patient hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . Our hypothesis change chemokine level affect development effective immune response HCV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long-term goal research understand immune complex ( ICs ) produce patient infected HCV , whether complex affect virus interaction target cell . We find many patient infected HCV increase frequency circulate B cell , evidence increase B cell activate proliferate . One possible mechanism increase would change level chemokines influence B cell localization trafficking . Our study aim test follow hypothesis : 1 . One hypothesis HCV infection result increase level specific cytokine chemokines may affect motility localization immature mature B cell . An alternative model HCV infection lead chronic antigenic stimulation B lymphocytes , abnormality B cell function associate HCV infection reflect chronic antigenic stimulation . 2 . A second hypothesis autoantibody immune complex present HCV patient serum contribute persistence spread viral infection . To test hypothesis , measure level chemokines , frequency circulate B cell ( mature rest B cell , mature activate B cell , memory B cell , immature B cell ) , level component ICs blood HCV-infected patient . Controls include healthy volunteer patient chronic liver disease unrelated HCV infection . No intervention patient care plan . When patient elect undergo standard antiviral therapy supervision hepatologists , study outcome therapy ( virologic response , partial transient virologic response , sustain virologic response ) determine whether observed alteration chemokine level , B cell frequency activation , immune complex level correlate patient 's response antiviral therapy .</detailed_description>
