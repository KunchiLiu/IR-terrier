	<brief_summary>PEP03 new chemical entity develop highly selective , potent , orally active 5-LO inhibitor . PEP03 exert action block generation cysteinyl LTs LTB4 . These LTs associate inflammatory response lung clinical sequela , include bronchospasm . Preclinical pharmacological in- vitro , ex-vivo in-vivo testing indicate PEP03 multiple beneficial action include prevention bronchoconstriction , reduction vascular leakage , cellular infiltration , bronchial hyperresponsiveness . Clinical study asthmatic patient indicate PEP03 improve FEV1 secondary endpoint , morning evening peak flow , daytime nighttime symptom score , beta-agonist use , physician ’ patient ’ global impression change . Since leukotrienes suggest involved pathophysiology COPD , study design explore clinical utility PEP03 treatment moderate COPD.6 ; 7 ; 8 ; 9</brief_summary>
