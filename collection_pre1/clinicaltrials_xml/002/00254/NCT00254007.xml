	<brief_summary>Problem : Depressive symptom common mental health problem follow traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , occur 87 % patient . Depression follow TBI important consequence include poor functioning , lack ability return work family activity prolong TBI symptom . The reason depression develop patient follow TBI unknown , make treatment difficult . One type brain protein show genetic difference people call serotonin transporter . People divide whether short protein ( S allele ) long protein ( L allele ) influence amount serotonin transporter . Serotonin key brain chemical depression many mental/psychiatric illness . We think genetic difference serotonin transporter , may make difference TBI , may become important TBI due nature injury . Methods : A consecutive sample 200 patient attend TBI clinic sustain mild-to-moderate TBI ( American Congress Rehabilitation Medicine criterion ) within last 2 month assess presence major depression ( standard criterion , standardize interview ) . In phase I , blood sample patient mild-to-moderate TBI depression without depression check presence 5-HTTPR genetic difference . This allow u study S allele likely TBI patient depression . In phase II , patient depression treat SSRI citalopram 6 week . At 6 week , upon discontinuation citalopram , depression assess . This allow u study depressed patient S allele respond poorly treatment . Persons assess depression treatment know genetic makeup patient . Results Expected : If serotonin transporter genetic difference confers susceptibility depression follow TBI , provide important information cause depression follow TBI document risk factor depression previously unstudied population . Also , SSRI antidepressant use treat depression TBI , study may identify subgroup TBI patient different medication give additional medication require .</brief_summary>
