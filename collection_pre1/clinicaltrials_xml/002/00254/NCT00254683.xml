	<brief_summary>Preoperative chemoradiation therapy preferred initial treatment option distal rectal cancer . However , assess tumor response preoperative chemoradiation therapy remain challenge colorectal surgeon , especially determine complete response , observe 10 % case . The purpose study evaluate use PET/CT assess distal rectal tumor response preoperative chemoradiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography ( PET/CT ) Assess Tumor Response Neoadjuvant Treatment Distal Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients distal rectal adenocarcinoma submit initial whole body PET/CT prior preoperative chemoradiation therapy 5-fluorouracil 5040 cGy . Six week 12 week preoperative treatment finish PET/CT repeat . At 1 2 year preoperative treatment conclude another PET/CT perform . The colorectal surgeon evaluate response chemoradiation therapy blind result PET/CT , radiologist blind response assessment . PET/CT result use determine treatment strategy , unless metastatic disease disease diagnose . Patients complete clinical response 8 week rigorously follow patient incomplete clinical response 8 week submit radical surgery . PET/CT result compare current radiological study final pathological report .</detailed_description>
