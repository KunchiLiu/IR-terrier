	<detailed_description>Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy , also term primary , induction , preoperative chemotherapy , define chemotherapy administer locoregional treatment . It first use locally advanced breast cancer 30 year ago . Classically , tumor treat radical surgery and/or radiotherapy . However , despite aggressive local therapy , patient relapse distant metastasis eventually die . The aim neoadjuvant therapy reduce tumor volume patient surgical resection , thus increase likelihood breast conservation . More recently , neoadjuvant therapy study way test relevance biological marker predict disease outcome . At least six randomized trial compare survival patient manage either neoadjuvant adjuvant approach . Two small trial suggest survival advantage patient treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Other study , include large trial ( 1,523 patient ) run National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Bowel Project ( NSABP ) , find difference disease-free overall survival . Induction Polymerase chain reaction ( pCR ) one primary goal neoadjuvant therapy patient evidence tumor cell breast lymph node treatment may longer disease-free overall survival . Biweekly weekly regimen may enhance dose intensity minimize re-growth cell cycle treatment . In fact , dose dense regimen even show survival benefit adjuvant set lymph node positive breast cancer , make possible use G-CSF . There best standard neoadjuvant treatment yet . Generally patient receive AC ( NSABP 14 ) 3-weekly regimen neoadjuvant set . In addition , incorporation taxanes 3 weekly schedule result statistically high pathological CR . More recently , weekly paclitaxel regimen report increased pathological response compare 3 weekly taxane regimen . Carboplatin also emerge effective agent treatment metastatic breast cancer . Moreover , combination carboplatin paclitaxel find synergistic three-weekly regimen weekly regimen . In fact , combination carboplatin , paclitaxel trastuzumab demonstrate survival advantage paclitaxel trastuzumab alone . The Phase III study , preliminary result present San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium , show addition carboplatin trastuzumab paclitaxel result six-month improvement time take disease progress , compare standard trastuzumab paclitaxel regimen . The study find median survival trastuzumab paclitaxel arm 33.5 month , group receive tripartite therapy yet reach point 36 month follow-up . Furthermore , weekly regimen drug find significantly improve tolerability three weekly regimen . Therefore , propose use 2-4 cycle AC q 2 week , use dose dense adjuvant study GM-CSF support day 4-13 cycle . After completion AC plan administer taxol carboplatin weekly total 9-12 dos one-week rest every 3 week treatment 12 week . Patients her-2 overexpressors FISH also receive trastuzumab weekly carboplatin paclitaxel since combination find synergistic advanced breast cancer improve clinical outcome . In small study , high pathological response rate achieve patient receive trastuzumab chemotherapy compare chemotherapy alone neoadjuvant . This study total 34 patient complete therapy . One arm receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy four cycle paclitaxel follow four cycle fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide . In second arm , patient receive chemotherapy regimen addition trastuzumab weekly schedule twenty-four week . A pCR achieve 65.2 % trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compare 25 % chemotherapy alone arm . In metastatic breast cancer , administration bevacizumab capecitabine show significant increase response rate . The combination arm bevacizumab plus capecitabine demonstrate response rate 19.8 % compare 9.1 % capecitabine arm alone . However , prolong free survival overall survival comparable treatment arm . In separate trial , addition bevacizumab standard chemotherapy regimen ( carboplatin paclitaxel ) patient advance relapsed non-small cell lung cancer demonstrate improve overall response time progression . In bevacizumab plus standard chemotherapy , high response rate ( 31.5 % vs. 18.8 % ) , long median time progression ( 7.4 vs. 4.2 month ) , modest increase survival ( 17.7 vs. 14.9 month find ) . In press release , South San Francisco , California , Basil , Switzerland March 14 , 2005 , interim analysis Phase III trial show bevacizumab plus paclitaxel carboplatin improve overall survival compare chemotherapy alone first-line therapy non-squamous , non-small cell lung cancer . These result present American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) meeting , May 13-17 , 2005 . This randomize , control , multicenter trial enrol 878 patient receive previous chemotherapy non-small cell lung cancer , compare standard chemotherapy paclitaxel carboplatin without bevacizumab . The trial sponsor National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , part National Institutes Health , Cooperative Research Development Agreement NCI Genentech , Inc. , conduct Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) . At San Antonio Breast Cancer Conference December 8 , 2004 , Dr. Mehta et al . present sequential use doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( AC ) follow paclitaxel , carboplatin , trastuzumab ( TCH ) patient Her-2 positive breast cancer . A pathological complete remission ( pCR ) see 7 8 patient . All patient receive 2-4 cycle AC follow 4 cycle 3 weekly TCH regimen . Only 1 8 patient 3mm residual invasive carcinoma biopsy scan . Moreover , 7 7 patient palpable lymph node demonstrate residual cancer neoadjuvant regimen . On April 18 , 2005 , interim analysis first Phase III randomize study confirm significant benefit use bevacizumab first-line treatment metastatic breast cancer . This multi-center study enrol 722 woman previously untreated metastatic breast cancer randomize patient receive adjuvant paclitaxel without bevacizumab . The trial exclude woman her-2/neu positive breast cancer unless receive trastuzumab previously unable receive medication . The interim analysis show progression-free survival early indication survival benefit addition bevacizumab chemotherapy compare chemotherapy alone . These finding present ASCO year . In separate trial , GM-CSF use breast cancer patient treat adriamycin base chemotherapy preferred growth factor neoadjuvant setting . The initial result suggestive improved survival breast cancer patient give 6 versus 5 versus 4 cycle chemotherapy GM-CSF support . Higher dendritic cell ( DC ) traffic show trend toward improved survival . Moreover , patient comparison treatment show percentage S100+ DC significantly increase course GM-CSF treatment . The result form basis current hypothesis primary tumor may vivo antigenic stimulus dendritic cell trafficking , combination prolong neoadjuvant chemotherapy GM-CSF induce immune enhancement may contribute good tumor control well survival .</detailed_description>
