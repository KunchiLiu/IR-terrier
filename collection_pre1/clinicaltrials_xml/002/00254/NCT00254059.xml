	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Compare Polysomnography With Overnight Home Oximetry Auto – CPAP Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research question explore whether conventional approach well term successful treatment , compliance treatment , quality life . There 2 arm study . Subject randomly assign either one follow two treatment option : 1 ) conventional investigation nasal CPAP treatment pathway comprise 2 overnight sleep study , one diagnosis one determining require level nasal CPAP treatment 2 ) experimental pathway use simplify home study ( overnight oximetry ) , together machine automatically adjust nasal CPAP pressure require amount , careful follow-up first 2 week treatment . Procedures : The study protocol require subject complete following procedure part routine clinical practice : History Physical Examination physician , Home Oximetry ( This simple test involve wear oxygen probe gently wrap around subject ’ finger night ’ sleep continuously measure amount oxygen blood detect obstruction subject ’ breathing . The probe easily apply subject require supervision ) , Spirometry ( simple non-invasive breathe test ) , Standardized Sleepiness Questionnaires , Orientation Education regard nasal CPAP therapy , compliance monitoring , Overnight polysomnography ( This procedure require subject spend night sleep laboratory variety painless non-invasive monitoring device attach body . The purpose obtain detailed information subject ’ sleep quality , breathing , heart function , body movement sleep . Subject continuously monitor trained technologist procedure. ) . The following procedure routine subject may require complete depend pathway assign . Follow-up visit Clinic Days 7 14 nasal CPAP treatment adjustment nasal CPAP pressure require ( could also do home ) , Repeat Home Oximetry require , Quality Life Questionnaire .</detailed_description>
