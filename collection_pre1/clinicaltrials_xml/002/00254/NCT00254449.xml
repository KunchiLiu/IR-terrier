	<detailed_description>This randomize , control , open-label , single center , phase 1 study normal healthy volunteer . Each subject 60 minute exposure two 5.0 × 5.5 cm NGX-4010 patch . In addition , two 5.0 × 5.5 cm comparable untreated control skin area identify evaluate . At baseline prior skin punch biopsy Weeks 1 ( ± 1 day ) , 12 ( ± 3 day ) 24 ( ± 7 day ) , QST patch-treated untreated control skin area perform evaluate . QST cool detection threshold heat-pain threshold , assessment mechanical ( sharp pain ) sensation tactile threshold perform two patch-treated two untreated control skin area . Serial skin punch biopsy patch-treated untreated control skin area obtain evaluated Weeks 1 ( ± 1 day ) , 12 ( ± 3 day ) , 24 ( ± 7 day ) . Skin patch-treated untreated control skin area anesthetize subcutaneous 1 % lidocaine , three millimeter ( mm ) skin biopsy obtain sterile punch tool designate area . Biopsy specimens fix overnight , cryoprotected phosphate buffer solution process . Thick section cut immunostained localization quantification nerve fiber epidermis visualization subepidermal plexus use antibody PGP 9.5 . Antibodies type IV collagen use identify basement membrane superficial blood vessel biopsy microsections . Vital sign adverse event ( AEs ) collect visit . Clinical laboratory test perform Screening Visit Termination Visit ( Week 24 ) .</detailed_description>
