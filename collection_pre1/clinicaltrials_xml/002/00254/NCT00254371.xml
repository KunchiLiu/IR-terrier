	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia major health problem among rapidly expand elderly population society . Disabilities directly relate muscle weakness , indirectly relate change body composition metabolic dysfunction , cause stagger toll disability health care cost . Osteopenia occur almost simultaneously sarcopenia elderly population muscle weakness increase risk fall therefore , fracture . Although issue separate address several study , integrate investigational approach well understand pathogenesis sarcopenia age-related metabolic abnormality investigate potential role androgens undertaken comprehensive manner . The program contain four independent research program , represent different research discipline , four separate core support four project . The main focus project determine effect replacement testosterone elderly men DHEA elderly men woman compare effect placebo treatment two-year period . Project 1 , `` Effect Androgen Replacement Muscle Metabolism '' specifically determine whether intervention differential effect size quality muscle term strength metabolic function . Project 2 , `` Effect Androgen Replacement Bone Metabolism , '' determine effect intervention bone mineral density marker bone turnover . Project 3 , `` The Effect Androgen Replacement Carbohydrate Metabolism , '' determine whether age-associated decrease circulate androgen contributes alteration carbohydrate metabolism commonly observe elderly insulin action , insulin secretion , glucose effectiveness . Project 4 , `` Effect Androgen Replacement Fat Metabolism '' determine whether change fat distribution occur age could result difference regional fatty acid uptake systemic fatty acid kinetics , whether determinant fat distribution alter intervention . The data emerge study integrate determine intervention sarcopenia metabolic change hopefully contribute good understanding muscle , bone , carbohydrate fat metabolism . This study hopefully form scientific basis future trial androgen replacement elderly .</brief_summary>
