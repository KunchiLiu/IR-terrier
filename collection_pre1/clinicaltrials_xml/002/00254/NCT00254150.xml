	<detailed_description>The development postoperative organ failure severely affect prognosis surgical patient , substantially increase utilization resource cost care . The presence tissue hypoxia particularly common likely result impairment adaptive mechanism myocardial function , lead inappropriately low cardiac output effect inflammatory mediator . Importantly , tissue hypoxia detect early . Indeed , hypoxic tissue compensate hypoperfusion increase oxygen extraction ( O2ER ) threshold value , change also reflect decreased venous oxygen saturation , uncompensated lactic acidosis . Hence , use oxygen extraction calculate arterial central venous oxygen saturation therapeutic goal appropriate monitor goal-directed hemodynamic strategy , reflect balance oxygen delivery consumption . In place O2ER surrogate , mixed venous oxygen saturation , use oxygen-derived value measure central blood drawn routinely place central line , place pulmonary artery catheter , may represent valuable alternative . Indeed , recent evidence suggest multifaceted goal-directed strategy , include fluid challenge , blood transfusion inotropes titrate keep central venous oxygen saturation higher predetermine threshold 70 % associate decreased mortality rate organ failure apply early phase septic shock severe sepsis . The aim present multicentre prospective randomize study compare outcomes patient randomize conventional management therapeutic strategy guide O2ER estimate ( O2ERe ) calculate arterial oxygen saturation central venous saturation ScvO2 . Specifically , hypothesize use goal-directed protocol aim maintain O2ERe previously define “ critical ” ( able discriminate survivor non-survivors ) value 26.7 % surgical intervention high-risk patient reduce rate postoperative organ failure , hospital length stay mortality , compare standard management base monitoring mean arterial pressure , central venous pressure urine output . High Risk surgical patient schedule elective abdominal extensive surgery eligible . After enrollment , patient randomize one two group treatment ( A B ) phone system 24-hour-a-day , 7-day-a-week basis . Randomization base permuted-block algorithm , allow stratification center . The exclusion criterion study : age 16 year , preexistent neurologic , malignant haematologic disease . In preparation surgery , patient equip central peripheral venous arterial catheter . Standard monitoring include continuous record electrocardiography ; body temperature , heart rate , pulse oxymetry arterial blood pressure . Central venous pressure , ScvO2 , arterial blood gas , lactate concentration , body temperature , urine output record hourly . Hemoglobin concentration measure deem necessary anesthesiologist . For purpose study , blood gas measure arterial central venous sample , arterial lactate O2ERe ( SaO2-ScvO2/SaO2 [ SaO2 : arterial oxygen saturation , ScvO2 : central venous saturation ] ) record induction anesthesia ( T0 ) , hourly cutaneous incision ( T1a-f ) , throughout surgery , first 6 hour postoperative period ( T2a-f ) postoperative day 1 . In group , patient manage achieve predefined standard goal , i.e . meen arterial pressure ( MAP ) &gt; 80 mmHg urine output &gt; 0.5ml/kg/h . The patient “ protocol group ” ( Group A ) manage keep O2ER 26.7 % , follow algorithm detailed figure 1 . In brief , fluid challenge ( colloids 250-1000 ml infuse 30 min restore central venous pressure least 10 mmHg ) , dobutamine ( incremental dose 3 µg/kg/min 15 µg/kg/min ) and/or pack red cell ( case hemoglobin 10 g/dl intraoperative hemorrhage &gt; 1000 ml ) could administer . There specific requirement regard type anesthesia group .</detailed_description>
