	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Critically ill neonate demonstrate low concentration antioxidant glutathione high incidence disease associate oxidative injury compare healthy neonate . Cysteine consider conditionally essential amino acid neonate rate limit substrate synthesis glutathione . We hypothesize parenterally-fed , critically ill neonate administer cysteine supplementation high concentration total glutathione , low ratio oxidize reduced glutathione , high glutathione synthetic rate , low level inflammatory cytokine production lipid peroxidation , decrease severity disease associate oxidative injury compare similarly ill parenterally feed neonate without cysteine supplementation . To test hypothesis , critically ill , parenterally feed neonate assign randomly receive cysteine isonitrogenous cysteine-free supplement TPN ( total parenteral nutrition ) regimen prospectively study double-blind fashion accord follow specific aim : 1. measure total concentration erythrocyte glutathione , oxidize reduce ( GSSG : GSH ) erythrocyte glutathione ratio , vivo fractional absolute synthetic rate erythrocyte glutathione utilizing [ 13C ] -glycine tracer , 2. measure plasma interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF-a ) , malondialdehyde concentration determinant illness severity degree oxidative injury reflect lipid peroxidation , 3. , measure duration mechanical ventilation , duration supplemental oxygen , duration hospitalization primary clinical outcome disease severity . By demonstrate whether cysteine supplementation increase synthesis concentration glutathione along subsequent decrease oxidative injury associate disease , widespread morbidity mortality vulnerable , critically ill neonate may improve . Background : Critically ill neonate treat Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) , whether premature full term , experience high incidence disease may secondary exacerbate oxidative injury . These include variety multi-factorial disease process respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) , persistent pulmonary hypertension ( PPHN ) , chronic lung disease ( CLD ) , sepsis , meconium aspiration , retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) , necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) . Within NICUs across U.S. per year , Neonatologists Pediatric Surgeons care estimate 100,000 critically ill neonate , approximately 35 % full-term 20 % ultimately expire illness despite major advance neonatal care . Some neonatal disease well know vary prevalence accord neonatal maturity . Premature neonates commonly suffer RDS , CLD , ROP NEC , susceptible extremely premature . However , 10-15 % neonate develop NEC full-term resultant mortality rate 35 % . Furthermore , disease process cause significant respiratory distress ( e.g. , PPHN , pneumonia , meconium aspiration ) commonly occur full-term neonate . The high morbidity disease significant impact neonate , parent , society general . Neonatal survivor critical illness without obvious neurologic injury find later low IQ 's , increase behavioral problem , decrease ability perform normal activity daily live , decrease scholastic ability , decrease health-related quality life compare healthy child . The economic burden parent society care neonatal illness astound . For example , economic cost neonatal healthcare alone increase 32-71 % critically ill neonate NEC compare appropriately match control without NEC . Adjusted inflation year 2005 , additional expense approximately $ 281,666 expect every NEC survivor prior discharge NICU ( equivalent $ 8.45 million per year single large healthcare center ) . Similarly , continue healthcare cost critically ill neonate even discharge insurmountable . Children survivor critical illness premature neonate show require increase utilization Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) resource ( e.g. , mechanical ventilation ) , increase length ICU care , frequent readmission PICU compare PICU patient . Although cysteine non-essential amino acid make methionine via cystathionine child adult , premature term neonate decrease capacity synthesize cysteine due low expression rate limit enzyme cystathionase . As result , plasma cysteine cystine concentration critically ill neonate low compare healthy infant . Unfortunately , plasma cysteine concentration neonates receive cysteine-free TPN remain low despite generous methionine intake relatively high plasma methionine concentration TPN fed neonate . This particularly relevant since cysteine limit substrate synthesis principal intracellular antioxidant body - glutathione . Intracellular glutathione serve many role cell include protection oxidative damage cause free radical glutathione peroxidase detoxification electrophilic metabolites multiple glutathione transferase . Thereby , level glutathione specific organ tissue think major determinant vulnerability organ tissue oxidative stress . Although majority whole body glutathione produce hepatocytes , cell , include erythrocyte , equivalent capacity synthesize glutathione de novo 3 amino acid cysteine , glutamate , glycine utilizing ( -glutamylcysteine glutathione synthetases . The active form glutathione ( reduced GSH ) also regenerate recycle oxidize glutathione ( glutathione disulfide GSSG ) glutathione reductase . However , use reduce glutathione exceeds capacity regeneration , GSSG expel cell intracellular glutathione store deplete . Regardless degree stress neonatal weight , critically ill neonate activity level glutathione synthetic enzyme comparable adult . Furthermore , neonate demonstrate unimpeded ability transport amino acid , include cysteine derivative , across cellular membrane . Hence , neonates demonstrate capacity synthesize glutathione give appropriate substrate available . Despite potential ability synthesize glutathione , low glutathione concentration high ratio GSSG : GSH demonstrate blood , lung , intestine critically ill neonate multiple study . Consequently , likely limit factor production glutathione critically ill neonate availability cysteine diet . Most critically ill neonate receive nutrition solely parenteral route acute duration illness , day week post-natal life . Unfortunately , parenteral amino acid formulation commercially available U.S. include cysteine significant nutrient . This cysteine relatively unstable cystine ( i.e. , cysteine dimer ) insoluble aqueous solution . However , cysteine supplementation TPN possible form cysteine-HCl give within 24 hour prior infusion . Subsequent provision cysteine manner result higher plasma cysteine concentration critically ill neonate . Although cysteine-HCl supplementation TPN show possible safe , routine practice current neonatal care . Nevertheless , cysteine-HCl supplementation standard practice major neonatal center U.S. order augment calcium phosphorus solubility TPN , benefit grow infant . Several vitro animal study demonstrate cysteine supplementation increase glutathione concentration blood , liver , intestine . Cysteine supplementation premature neonatal erythrocyte cell culture demonstrate increased glutathione concentration compare non-cysteine supplemented control . Malloy et . al . show cysteine-HCl supplemented TPN-fed beagle pup high concentration plasma cysteine hepatic glutathione unsupplemented TPN-fed pup . Similarly , Pollack et . al . demonstrate intestinal glutathione concentration significantly increase premature newborn rabbit administer cysteine-HCl supplementation compare non-supplemented control . Moreover , colonic glutathione concentration find similar maternally rear , term newborn rabbit . As clinical corollary , human study stress adult acute respiratory distress syndrome demonstrate elevated concentration glutathione improvement recovery cysteine supplementation . Septic malnourish child supplement enteral cysteine demonstrate increase glutathione concentration vivo glutathione synthetic rate measure utilizing novel non-radioactive , stable isotope methodology . Furthermore , septic child supplement cysteine resolve illness quicker unsupplemented counterpart . These study suggest cysteine-HCl supplementation may improve glutathione production decrease oxidative stress critically ill neonate . There yet investigation confirm improve glutathione concentration vivo glutathione synthetic rate occur critically ill neonate supplement cysteine-HCl perturbation lead decrease amount oxidative tissue injury patient endure . This gap study serve perfect set propose randomized , blind , placebo-controlled trial adequately power detect pre-determined difference two group .</detailed_description>
