	<brief_title>Study Dasatinib Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dasatinib anticancer drug design block function BCR-ABL , abnormal protein responsible cause leukemia certain cell . If find eligible take part study agree , take dasatinib every day study . Dasatinib take mouth water . Every 1-2 week first 4 week study , around 2 tablespoon blood drawn routine blood test . The blood test repeat every 4-6 week 1 year start therapy every 3-4 month 2 year , often doctor think need . A bone marrow aspiration also take check status disease every 3-4 month first year often doctor think need long study . You give medication diary monitor miss dos . You also ask visit doctor physical exam vital sign measure periodically . These visit schedule least every 3-4 month first year , recommend every 6 12 month study . The visit may schedule often depend status disease . Treatment may continue 15-18 year long doctor feel necessary control leukemia . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . If decide stop participating study , encourage discuss decision study doctor . For Patients Already Enrolled : If already enrol study assign receive dasatinib twice day , able continue receive study drug schedule . However , experience side effect , study doctor may choose switch daily schedule feel may help get rid decrease risk side effect . This investigational study . Dasatinib investigational approve FDA clinical trial . A total 150 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis Phpositive BcrAbl positive CML early chronic phase CML ( i.e. , time diagnosis &lt; /= 12 month ) . Except hydroxyurea , patient must receive minimal prior therapy , define &lt; 1 month ( 30 day ) prior IFNalpha ( without araC ) and/or FDA approve TKI 2 . Continued # 1 : Clonal evolution define presence additional chromosomal abnormality Ph chromosome historically include criterion accelerate phase . However , patient clonal evolution criterion accelerate phase significantly well prognosis , present diagnosis may impact prognosis . Thus , patient clonal evolution criterion accelerate phase eligible study 3 . Age &gt; /= 16 year ( Age &gt; 18 year participate optional symptom burden assessment ) 4 . ECOG performance 02 5 . Adequate end organ function , define follow : total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN , SGPT &lt; 2.5x ULN , creatinine &lt; 1.5x ULN 6 . Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study , keep policy hospital . 7 . Reliable telephone access receive call interactive voice response system ( IVR ) ( applicable patient participate optional symptom burden assessment ) 1 . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) cardiac class 34 heart disease 2 . Cardiac Symptoms : Patients meet follow criterion eligible unless cleared Cardiology : Uncontrolled angina within 3 month ; Diagnosed suspect congenital long QT syndrome ; Any history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , Torsades de pointes ) ; Prolonged QTc interval preentry electrocardiogram ( &gt; 450 msec ) Fridericia Bazett 's correction ; Uncontrolled hypertension ; History significant bleeding disorder unrelated cancer , include : 3 . Cont : Diagnosed congenital bleeding disorder ( von Willebrand 's disease ) Diagnosed acquire bleed disorder w/in 1 year ( acquire antifactor VIII antibody ) ; Pts currently take drug generally accept risk cause Torsades de Pointes include : quinidine , procainamide , disopyramide amiodarone , sotalol , ibutilide , dofetilide erythromycin , clarithromycin chlorpromazine , haloperidol , mesoridazine , thioridazine , pimozide cisapride , bepridil , droperidol , methadone , arsenic , chloroquine , domperidone , halofantrine , levomethadyl , pentamidine , sparfloxacin , lidoflazine . 4 . Patients active , uncontrolled psychiatric disorder include : psychosis , major depression , bipolar disorder 5 . Women pregnancy potential must practice 2 effective method birth control course study , manner risk failure minimized.Prior study enrollment , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . 6 . Continued : Women must continue birth control duration trial least 3 month last dose study drug ; Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude ; All WOCBP MUST negative pregnancy test prior first receive investigational product . If pregnancy test positive , patient must receive investigational product must enrol study . 7 . Patients late chronic phase ( i.e. , time diagnosis treatment &gt; 12 month ) , accelerate blast phase exclude . 8 . The definition CML phase follow : ) Early chronic phase : time diagnosis therapy &lt; /= 12 month ; Late chronic phase : time diagnosis therapy &gt; 12 month , b ) Blastic phase : presence 30 % blast peripheral blood bone marrow , c ) Accelerated phase CML : presence follow feature : •Peripheral marrow blast 15 % , •Peripheral marrow basophils 20 % , •Thrombocytopenia &lt; 100 x 10^9/L unrelated therapy , • Documented extramedullary blastic disease outside liver spleen .</criteria>
