	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize , open-label , parallel-group study determine body absorbs eliminate mesalamine follow administration either 30 mg/kg/day , 60 mg/kg/day 90 mg/kg/day 400 mg delayed-release tablet give every 12 hour 28 day child adolescent active ulcerative colitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Asacol Absorption , Metabolism Excretion Children Adolescents With Ulcerative Colitis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis type inflammatory bowel disease characterize diffuse , continuous inflammation colon . Recent estimate suggest approximately 17,000 child 5 17 year age U.S. diagnose ulcerative colitis . Estimates average age onset child vary , although 80-90 % patient 9 year age old symptom develop . Asacol delayed-release tablet formulation design deliver mesalamine ( also know mesalazine ) pH â‰¥ 7.0 . This property result release drug terminal ileum beyond . Physiologic factor pH surround medium , transit time intestinal region interest , rate extent absorption metabolism govern Asacol drug release delivery , turn influence pharmacokinetic profile deliver drug . These physiologic factor effect Asacol pharmacokinetics study adult , correspond study child perform . However , relevant study describe gastrointestinal pH ; transit time ; pharmacokinetic aspect drug absorption , metabolism , excretion pediatric patient ( relative adult ) provide reason expect performance characteristic Asacol pediatric population similar measure adult . In compassionate-use study include 66 child age 3 16 year , safety profile long-term mesalamine therapy ( 10 93 mg/kg/day ) similar observe among adult patient enrol study . In addition , retrospective study 732 pediatric patient inflammatory bowel disease ( 153 treat mesalamine ) , D'Agata , et al . conclude mesalamine safe well tolerate use long term dose range 13 111 mg/kg/day . Although clinical study mesalamine perform child , pediatric gastroenterologist use mesalamine treat child inflammatory bowel disease , dose high propose study ( 100 mg/kg/day ) recommend . This study provide information pharmacokinetics mesalamine major metabolite child treat Asacol mildly moderately active ulcerative colitis . It design meet expectation outline Written Request issue FDA , well regulatory requirement study weight-based equivalent 4.8 g/day . The age-appropriate dose formulation , 400 mg tablet , use , patient dose every 12 hour , since regimen consider convenient pediatric patient parent . During open-label , randomize , 4-week parallel-group study pediatric patient , patient stratify age ( 5-8 year 9-17 year ) , randomly assign one 3 dose level ( 30 mg/kg/day , 60 mg/kg/day , 90 mg/kg/day ) manner describe Section 3.5.1 . Patients weigh less 20 kg assign 30 mg/kg group , patient weigh 60 kg assign 90 mg/kg group , due dose concern . A total 48 patient enrol ( 8/treatment group/age stratum ) , expectation 36 ( 6/treatment group/age stratum ) complete .</detailed_description>
