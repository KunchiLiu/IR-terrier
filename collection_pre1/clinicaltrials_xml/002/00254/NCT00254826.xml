	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether immune globulin limit amount yellow fever vaccine virus present blood vaccination without compromise immunity associate yellow fever vaccine . The study enroll 80 participant two group 40 . The first group receive yellow fever vaccine salt-water placebo . The second group receive yellow fever vaccine immune globulin . The amount vaccine virus immune response group compare . Yellow fever vaccine use protect human Yellow Fever Vaccine disease since 1930s .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Yellow Fever Virus Vaccine Immune Globulin Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize outpatient study design determine human immune globulin ( IG ) limit viremic response 17D yellow fever vaccine without compromise immunogenicity . The yellow fever 17D vaccine YF-VAX® manufacture United States . The IG , Gama STAN S/D® , manufacture U.S . The study conduct 80 healthy adult 18-40 year age U.S . Participants randomize receive YF-VAX® plus saline ( 40 subject ) , YF-VAX® plus Gama STAN S/D® ( 40 subject ) . The dose Gama STAN S/D® use prevention hepatitis A , i.e . 0.06 mL/kg . The lot Gama STAN S/D® test show contain yellow fever neutralize antibody log neutralize index &gt; 0.7 . Saline give blind vaccine administrator vaccinee treatment group . A stratified randomization procedure use ensure equal distribution study medication participant gender . Safety tolerability assess comparison incidence adverse event across two treatment group . The hypothesis test whether co-administration yellow fever antibody yellow fever vaccine ( passive-active immunization ) result effective immunization reduce viremia . The effectiveness use Gama STAN S/D® combination YF-VAX® assess reduction viremic response vaccinee . Viremia measure replication YF 17D virus host tissue , absence viremia indicate virus replication host tissue abrogate . Abrogation virus replication expect limit potential dissemination virus virus invasion damage vital organ , include liver brain . The method use quantify viremia reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) direct plaquing Vero cell monolayers . In addition , serum collect pre-vaccination blood draw post-vaccination test yellow fever neutralize antibody measure immunogenicity . The method use detect neutralizing antibody plaque-reduction neutralization test ( PRNT ) perform Vero cell culture use constant serum-varying virus technique standardize U.S. Food Drug Administration ( Beaty et al. , 1989 ) . The PRNT recently validate used support Phase 3 clinical trial YF-VAX® ( Monath et al . 2002a ) . The primary endpoint comparison proportion subject without prior yellow fever immunization treatment group measurable vaccine virus vaccination . The T-cell activation , cytokine response , dendritic cell response kinetics phenotype natural killer ( NK ) cell also characterize . Study participant exclude significant underlying medical condition , history sensitivity IG , establish contraindication yellow fever vaccine , include immunosuppression , thymus disorder , pregnancy , egg hypersensitivity . These exclusion criterion represent major contraindication use Gama STAN S/D® yellow fever vaccine , include YF-VAX® . The study consist Screening Period Treatment Period . During Screening Period ( Days -30 -1 ) , informed consent obtain , eligibility study entry assess baseline test perform . Subjects satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion eligible enter Treatment Period randomize one two treatment group . On Day 0 subject receive either YF-VAX® plus saline , YF-VAX® plus Gama STAN S/D® . Subjects return clinic daily visit day 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 30 , 91 . The total duration participation individual subject approximately 91 day . Safety assessment vaccinated subject include adverse event report clinical laboratory evaluation . To ensure thorough report adverse event time interval adverse event associate yellow fever vaccination might expect occur , subject require complete study diary Days 0-28 . The study diary record local reaction ( i.e. , pain , redness , swell ) systemic reaction ( i.e. , feel ill [ malaise ] , headache , muscle ache , fever , chill , rash , tiredness , general symptom ) . These principal symptom side effect know associated yellow fever 17D vaccine . At visit , study personnel perform clinical evaluation day 7 , 14 30 study staff review diary card follow adverse event occur since vaccination . A sample size efficacy 80 participant include 40 subject group receive YF-VAX® plus saline 40 subject receive YF-VAX® plus Gama STAN S/D® provide 80 % power one-sided test significance level alpha 0.05 , assume 93 % subject receive immune globulin exhibit detectable viremia reduction 35 % ( 61 % subject ) follow administration immune globulin .</detailed_description>
