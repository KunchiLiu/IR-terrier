	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy BrainPort™ Balance Device Improve Balance Bilateral Vestibular Hypofunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People Bilateral Vestibular Dysfunction ( BVD ) often experience disable symptom , greatly affect quality life ability work . Current vestibular treatment always allow patient fully recover . Many patient either improve reach plateau conventional vestibular rehabilitation , still difficulty daily function . The BrainPort™ balance device intend provide information head position brain electrotactile stimulation tongue improve balance subject vestibular disorder . This study prospective , multi-center , randomize double-blinded study compare postural stability BVD subject use BrainPort™ balance device postural stability control subject use sham device respective baseline measure group . The primary objective study determine whether electrotactile stimulation tongue , use BrainPort™ balance device , improve postural stability , measure improvement performance composite Computerized Dynamic Posturography use NeuroCom® Sensory Organization Test subject chronic bilateral vestibular dysfunction ( BVD ) . The secondary objective evaluate improvement quality life , measure Activities Specific Balance Confidence ( ABC ) Scale , Dizziness Handicap Inventory ( DHI ) , Dynamic Gait Index ( DGI ) , demonstrate decrease number fall NeuroCom® Sensory Organization Test . In addition , monitor number fall occur subject ' normal activity daily live . The long-term objective evaluate safety efficacy device use one-year period .</detailed_description>
