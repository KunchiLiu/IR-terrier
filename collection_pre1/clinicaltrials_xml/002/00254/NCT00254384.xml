	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn chemotherapy ( cisplatin , docetaxel ) safe give patient whose lung cancer surgically remove , learn maintenance therapy biologic agent erlotinib , give surgery , safe . Another goal study look change occur epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) change reflect different cell body . The effect treatment participant 's quality life survival , well effect different cell body , also study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Erlotinib ( Tarcevaâ , OSI-774 ) drug help block activity enzyme believe play important role cell growth . It hop block enzymes slow tumor growth . Both cisplatin docetaxel ( Taxotereâ ) commonly use chemotherapy drug . These drug design target destroy cancer cell . If find eligible , begin receive chemotherapy cisplatin docetaxel . Cisplatin docetaxel give vein every 3 week . Both give day every 3 week . Docetaxel give first 1 hour . Cisplatin give second 30 minute 1 hour . You receive three 3-week cycle chemotherapy study . Treatment erlotinib begin surgery remove lung cancer . You take erlotinib mouth every day remainder treatment study . While take chemotherapy , blood test every 3 week look blood count . This ensure body recovered chemotherapy enough continue treatment . About 2 teaspoon blood need test . These sample use routine lab test . You see physician every 3 week . At visit , physical exam chest x-ray . You may neurological exam doctor think necessary . This exam look whether numbness , test hearing vision , include standard evaluation . Your vital sign weight monitor ask certain side effect . If necessary , depend side effect , may need frequent visit see physician . After 3 cycle chemotherapy ( 9 week ) , CT scan chest abdominal area , possibly CT scan area disease may come back . These do check status disease . Within 90 day surgery , begin take erlotinib . On Day 1 erlotinib treatment , physical exam , performance status evaluation ( question ability perform everyday activity ) , chest x-ray , blood drawn ( 2 teaspoon ) routine test . These test repeat Month 2 , Month 3 , every 3 month . On Day 1 erlotinib treatment every 3 month , also CT scan chest abdominal area , possibly CT scan area disease may come back . You may receive treatment study 1 year ( 3 cycle cisplatin/docetaxel daily erlotinib 1 year ) receive long-term follow-up ( 5 year total ) physician monitor condition disease status . Your doctor may decide take study experience significant side effect medical condition worsens . Follow-up visit include chest x-ray CT scan every 3 month Year 2 every 6 month Year 5 . This investigational study . Erlotinib approve FDA treatment non-small cell lung cancer . Its use study experimental . Docetaxel cisplatin FDA approve commercially available . A total 50 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
