	<brief_summary>The primary objective demonstrate non-inferiority ciclesonide compare beclomethasone-HFA occurrence Class 1 lens event nuclear ( NO ) , cortical ( C ) , posterior subcapsular ( P ) lens opacification within 12 month . Secondary objective compare ciclesonide beclomethasone respect class II class III best correct visual acuity intraocular pressure baseline 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Of Ciclesonide And Beclomethasone On Lens Opacification In Adult Subjects With Moderate To Severe Persistent Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , multinational , active-controlled , double-blind , randomize ( 1:1 ) parallel group study effect inhale ciclesonide HFA-MDI 640 mcg/day beclomethasone HFA-MDI 640 mcg/day lens opacification adult subject moderate severe persistent asthma . The study consist 1-14 day screen phase subject eligibility determine , follow 12-month double-blind treatment phase . Lens opacification evaluate slit lamp examination perform pupillary dilation least 6.0 mm randomization 4 month , 8 month , 12 month treatment use LOCS III system grade lens opacity . Best-corrected visual acuity intraocular pressure measure eye examination visit . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) constitute monitor safety throughout double-blind treatment phase .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males nonpregnant , nonlactating female 18 year age old history moderate severe persistent asthma duration least 2 month prior screen . At screening , FEV1 must ≥ 40 % ≤ 85 % predict . Documented use inhale corticosteroid therapy dose least 1 month prior screen . Able demonstrate acceptable oral inhaler technique . Nonsmoker least past year less 10 packyear smoke history previous smoker . Written inform consent agreement . History prior cataract surgery either eye . Evidence congenital cortical cataract . Inability grade nuclear , cortical , posterior subcapsular opacity either eye LOCS III baseline slit lamp examination . Inability dilate pupil least 6.0 mm . Nuclear opalescence LOCS III grade ≥ 4 either eye baseline slit lamp examination . Cortical lens opacity LOCS III grade ≥ 3 either eye baseline slit lamp examination . Posterior subcapsular lens opacity LOCS III grade ≥ 2 either eye baseline slit lamp examination . Elevated intraocular pressure require treatment Best correct visual acuity le 74 letter ( equivalent vision worse 20/30 ) either eye baseline . Females pregnant lactate positive pregnancy test Visit 1 ( Screening ) . Have 1 inpatient hospitalization past year asthma exacerbation . Have 2 burst oral steroid per year past 2 year prior screen . Chronic use oral , injectable , topical steroid except inhaled corticosteroid condition . Topical corticosteroid designate mild potency StoughtonCornell Scale European Guideline level corticosteroid activity allow ( see AppendixG ) . Any chronic condition likely require treatment oral systemic corticosteroid asthma ( e.g . systemic lupus , inflammatory bowel disease , rheumatoid arthritis ) . Topical ocular steroid treatment within 3 month prior screen . Chronic recurrent inflammatory disease either eye likely result visual abnormality require treatment ocular steroid . History drug alcohol abuse . Any clinically significant medical condition would interfere subject 's ability participate comply study protocol . Subject unlikely comply protocol , e.g. , uncooperative attitude , inability return followup visit , unlikelihood completing study . Subject investigator subinvestigator , research assistant , pharmacist , study coordinator , staff relative thereof directly involve conduct protocol . Hypersensitivity investigational product drug similar chemical structure . Have treat investigational drug/product within 30 day prior Visit 1 ( Screening ) .</criteria>
