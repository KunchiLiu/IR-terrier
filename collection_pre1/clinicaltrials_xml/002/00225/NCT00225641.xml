	<brief_summary>The aim conduct prospective multicentre randomise study compare two different control regimens resection colorectal cancer stage II - III . Follow-up surgery colorectal cancer controversial issue . The reason follow-up : obtain good overall survival , scientific purpose and/or psychological reason and/or quality assessment . Meta-analyses randomise controlled study lately show beneficial effect overall mortality could find intense follow-up compare sporadic . This study compare regimen CT-scan MR scan liver , control carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , CT-scan X-ray lung two group either control 12 36 month , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 month . The efficacy parameter total cancer-specific mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim investigate efficiency two follow-up program radical surgery colorectal cancer . Colorectal cancer attack 3-5 % European population lifetime , 75 % potential curative surgery perform . Follow surgery costly time consume patient Health Care Systems . The intensity follow well method employ vary tremendously center centre country country . Until recently scientific documentation cost-effectiveness follow-up sparse , recent compile data indicate intense follow save life compare sporadic follow-up acceptable cost . However , optimal follow-up interval best method unknown . Previous result indicate scan liver measure tumor-marker CEA may way forward . A prospective randomise multicenter study center Denmark ( approx . 15 ) , Sweden ( approx . 20 ) , Poland ( approx . 6 ) , Hungary ( approx . 2 ) perhaps The Netherlands UK start 2005 basic work protocol , ethical committee finish . This basic work support Nordic Cancer Union grant 25,000 EUROS . The patient randomise follow-up CEA , multislice CT scan liver X-ray lung , either 12 36 month surgery 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 36 month surgery . If recurrence detect , patient offer best available treatment either repeat surgery curative intent palliative oncological treatment . Data collect electronically via internet already construct database . The primary efficacy parameter 3 5 year overall cancer-specific survival . It plan recruitment least 2,500 patient , feasible 2 year .</detailed_description>
