	<brief_summary>Given high prevalence type 2 diabetes 2- 4-fold increase risk fatal non-fatal coronary heart disease event patient , long-term glycemic control great importance . TZDs improve glycemic control patient type 2 DM well enhance insulin-mediated glucose disposal . However , improvement glycemic control see TZDs may blunt long run weight gain . Previous data weight gain TZD therapy patient type 2 DM sparse . It generally assume increase adipocyte differentiation cause weight gain association TZD treatment may limit use . Increased body weight assume compromise positive effect treatment . There also theoretical concern , development new adipocytes , future weight loss may difficult . However , weight gain primarily due failure adjust caloric intake proportion decrease urinary glucose loss , totally preventable . It previously show improvement glycemia favor weight gain decrease energy loss urine glucose . Severity weight gain appear proportional level glycemic control achieve . The overall goal propose research provide experimental evidence later alternative show modest weight gain take place association effective rosiglitazone treatment hyperglycemic patient type 2 DM primarily due therapeutic efficacy . More specifically , decrease caloric intake proportion decrease urinary glucose loss associate improved glycemic control , able prevent significant weight gain follow Rosiglitazone treatment . In order provide optimal dietary modification universally apply TZD-treated patient clinical practice , group fix amount caloric restriction per day . It first randomize control trial potential strategy prevention weight gain associate thiazolidinediones .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Randomized , control trial . Volunteers study recruit advertisement local newspaper well Stanford University e-mail . All study occur Stanford General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . At baseline , enrol candidate require keep daily food beverage record 2 week well blood sugar log least 2 measurement day ( fast pre-dinner ) . Candidates initial nutrition/diabetes consult dietitian . They also ask 24-hour urine collection week ( 2 time 2 week period ) quantitative assessment glucosuria . During 2 week individual come GCRC outpatient visit week weight , blood pressure , blood sugar check . After initial two week , individual undergo meal profile test , 12-hour overnight fast , consist measurement daylong plasma glucose , free fatty acid , insulin response standard meal . Food test prepare GCRC Metabolic kitchen . In order ass degree postprandial day-long hyperinsulinemia benefit rosiglitazone metabolic abnormality patient poor glycemic control , plan measure plasma glucose , free fatty acid , insulin concentration 8 hourly interval four hour breakfast 8 four hour lunch noon response identical test meal contain ( percentage calorie ) 15 % protein , 40 % fat , 45 % carbohydrate . Baseline blood sample fast lipid lipoprotein concentration obtain overnight fast day meal profile . Cholesterol lipoprotein subclass analyze VAP-II method base continuous enzymatic analysis cholesterol lipoprotein class separate single vertical spin centrifugation use controlled-dispersion flow analyzer . Hemoglobin A1C measure affinity chromography assay baseline end study . Randomization protocol . After completion Meal Profile test subject start Rosiglitazone improvement glycemic control randomize one three group ( 15 subject group ) : 1 . Continuation current diet . 2 . Reduced calorie diet . Amount reduce calorie calculate proportionally calories lose via glucosuria . 3 . Fixed calorie reduction diet . Reduction daily caloric intake 500 kcal . Rosiglitazone give 4 mg first 4 week , tolerate , increase 8 mg duration study . All candidate counsel general meal plan nutritionist . Follow-up . Subjects follow 4 month . They come GCRC twice month weight , blood pressure , blood sugar check , nutrition follow-up . End study measurement clinical procedure : meal profile , lipid panel , 24-hour urine collection do end 4 month follow-up period . Liver function test do baseline , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 week Rosiglitazone . Outcomes : expect demonstrate end study modification diet prevents weight gain Rosiglitazone treat patient offer optimal dietary intervention could apply TZD-treated patient minimize weight gain effectively treat DM insulin resistance .
