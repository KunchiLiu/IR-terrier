	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Pioglitazone Glimepiride Rate Progression Atherosclerotic Disease .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes chronic disease multiple metabolic defect result hyperglycemia arise inadequate insulin activity . Type 2 diabetes usually result progression reduce sensitivity hepatic peripheral tissue cell circulate insulin progressive inability body produce adequate insulin overcome insulin resistance , result impaired glucose tolerance ultimately overt diabetes . In United States , estimate 21 million people diabetes , type 2 diabetes occur approximately 90 % 95 % case . Type 2 diabetes also represent important risk group development accelerate atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis measure different procedure . One noninvasive , commonly use procedure carotid B-mode ultrasound measurement carotid intima-media thickness , show useful measurement clinical cardiovascular event multiple study . Coronary artery calcification marker coronary artery disease , electron beam tomography sensitive tool evaluation coronary artery calcium . Electron beam tomography measurement produce coronary artery calcium score represent plaque burden . Subjects diabetes mellitus accelerate coronary artery disease . Even treatment elevate lipid level , rate coronary event still exceed see non-diabetic subject treat lipid-lowering agent . Diabetic subject also continue increased mortality rate compare non-diabetic subject myocardial infarction . Therefore , detection sub-clinical atherosclerosis prevention myocardial infarction subject diabetes remains important priority . Pioglitazone thiazolidinedione develop Takeda Chemical Industries , Ltd , depend presence insulin mechanism action . Data suggest thiazolidinediones may inhibit development atherosclerosis non-diabetic , atherosclerosis mouse model . These finding suggest class drug may effect vessel wall suppress development atherosclerotic lesion . This study investigate effect pioglitazone glimepiride rate progression atherosclerotic disease measure carotid intima-media thickness electron beam tomography coronary artery subject type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
