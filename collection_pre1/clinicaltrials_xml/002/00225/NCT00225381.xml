	<detailed_description>During clinical anesthesia , astonish CO2 monitoring consist mainly end-tidal PCO2 confirm endotracheal intubation estimate ventilation , O2 monitoring consist single PO2 measurement detect hypoxic gas mixture . Better understanding O2 CO2 kinetics monitor define system pathophysiology greatly enhance safety anesthesia detect critical event abrupt decrease cardiac output ( Q.T ) vena-caval compression abdominal surgery , occurrence CO2 pulmonary embolism laparoscopy , rise tissue O2 consumption ( V.O2 ) light anesthesia , onset anaerobic metabolism ( V.CO2 disproportionately high V.O2 ) . In previous grant period , discovery CO2 kinetics non-steady state reveal significant gap understand O2 kinetics . To end , 5-compartment lung model gas kinetics body non-steady state develop , incorporate complex interaction O2 CO2 lung , blood , tissue . This computer model use formulate follow hypothesis , elucidate mechanism underlie subsequent measure data anesthetize patient . The investigator already develop two innovative device essential V.O2 measurement : A fast response temperature humidity sensor , mix device ( bymixer ) measurement mixed gas fraction , especially design anesthesia system . The investigator also design sophisticated bench system validation device , show high accuracy performance measurement . Hypotheses test overall research theme include : - That pulmonary O2 uptake ( V.O2 ) anesthetize patient much low value quote literature . - That inhalation anesthesia influence V.O2 differently total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) . - That acute decrease cardiac output ( Q.T ) ( patient position change ) transiently decrease V.O2 decrease CO2 elimination ( V.CO2 ) sustain tissue CO2 store hundred fold great O2 ( please see previously approve IRB protocol , HS # 2000-1325 ) . - That positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) decrease V.O2 V.CO2 due decrease Q.T alveolar ventilation ( V.A ) , appearance high ventilation-to-perfusion ( V.A/Q . ) unit ( please see previously approve IRB protocol , HS # 2000-1325 ) . - That Trendelenburg ( head ) position increase V.O2 V.CO2 due increase Q.T . - That V.O2 help determine necessity blood transfusion . - That continuous measurement respiratory quotient ( RQ=V.CO2/V.O2 ) detect transition anaerobic metabolism . - That continuous measurement respiratory RQ good alternative arterial blood gas sampling . - That continuous measurement respiratory RQ determine necessity nutritional support long operation . In protocol , investigator study clinical implication measurement , believe miss link anesthesia monitoring . Elucidating mechanisms underlie acute pathophysiology advance understand O2 CO2 kinetics non-steady state , allow non-invasive diagnosis critical event clinical anesthesia confer increase safety , especially majority healthy patient receive non-invasive monitoring . A separate section study , compliment metabolic gas exchange study bymixer flow system examination respiratory gas portable mass-spectrometer detect volatile organic compound anaerobic metabolism . The experimental anaerobic model adult patient undergo surgery require tourniquet . Anaerobic metabolism detect acid base balance blood test , bymixer flow measurement mass spectrometer . Anesthesia maintain total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) patient arterial line . No intervention would take . It observational type study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All adult patient UCIMC undergo anesthesia surgery eligible study Patients must American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) Class 1 2 ( generally healthy patient ) . We plan study 100 patient , divide 5 equally numbered group . A power analysis sample size show need minimum 20 patient . High risk 3 subgroup ( ASA 3 ) , approximately 20 adult patient ( include within 100 planned patient ) , investigate ( 1 ) RQ correlation arterial blood gas , ( 2 ) exercise study ( 3 ) esophageal Doppler study . These study group include patient categorized ASA 1 , 2 3 , ( total 60 patient ) however ; total number ASA 3 patient exceed 20 . Subjects surgeries around head neck , well surgery require patient lie face exclude study Gender minority status exclusion factor potential study patient Cardiovascular : Significant vascular disease , especially cardiac cerebral vascular disease Patients exclude history myocardial infarction cerebral vascular attack Significant hypertension ( &gt; 170 systolic , &gt; 90 diastolic ) ( except high risk subgroup mention ) Pulmonary : Significant asthma ( mild persistent great accord National Asthma Education Prevention Program classification system ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ( Stage II : Moderate COPD accord Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease classification Worsening airflow limitation , ( FEV1 â‰¤30 % ) , usually progression symptom , shortness breath typically develop exertion ) , bullous lung disease , raise intracranial pressure ( except high risk subgroup mention ) Esophageal Doppler : If localize pathology present , include pharyngeal tumor significant esophageal varix , esophageal probe use . Emergency case : Excluded study . Only elective patient enrol . Short surgery : Surgeries expect last 45 minute less exclude .</criteria>
