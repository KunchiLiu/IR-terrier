	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Pioglitazone Compared Glimepiride Coronary Atherosclerotic Disease Progression Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes chronic disease multiple metabolic defect result hyperglycemia arise inadequate insulin activity . Type 2 diabetes usually result progression reduce sensitivity hepatic peripheral tissue cell circulate insulin ( ie , insulin resistance ) progressive inability body produce adequate insulin overcome insulin resistance ( ie , insulin deficiency due beta-cell insufficiency ) result impaired glucose tolerance ultimately overt diabetes . In United States , estimate 21 million people diabetes , type 2 diabetes occur approximately 90 % 95 % case . The goal treat type 2 diabetes control blood glucose thereby prevent long-term complication . Adequate glycemic control paramount attempt avert chronic complication , include blindness ; renal dysfunction result dialysis renal transplantation ; neuropathy ; non-traumatic amputation ; macrovascular complication , include myocardial ischemia myocardial infarction , stroke , peripheral arterial disease . Intensive glucose management early stage diabetes may help forestall complication . Therapeutic agent develop address major functional metabolic defect associate type 2 diabetes : decrease beta-cell function , elevate hepatic glucose output , insulin resistance . Thiazolidinediones increase glucose utilization , decrease gluconeogenesis , increase glucose disposal bind nuclear receptor know peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor . Thiazolidinediones reduce insulin resistance enhance insulin sensitivity muscle cell , adipose tissue , hepatic cell ( inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis ) , direct impact insulin secretion . Thus , thiazolidinediones improve glycemic control result reduce level circulate insulin without predispose patient hypoglycemia . Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor find tissue important insulin action , adipose tissue , skeletal muscle , liver . The great concentration peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma receptor adipose tissue . This study design compare effect pioglitazone compare glimepiride progression atherosclerotic disease , measure intravascular ultrasound .</detailed_description>
