	<brief_title>Neurocognitive Effects Ziprasidone : Relationship Working Memory Dopamine Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Typical neuroleptic ( i.e. , haloperidol , chlorpromazine ) effective ameliorate positive psychotic symptom schizophrenia less efficacious treatment negative symptom , limit evidence support ability attenuate cognitive dysfunction observe schizophrenia ( Meltzer et al . 1999 ) . The primary mechanism typical neuroleptic achieve effect dopamine ( DA ) blockade , recent data suggest DA blockade may associate diminished cognitive improvement despite effective clinical treatment . For example , recent molecular genetics study show subject great DA availability display well cognitive performance task executive functioning ( Malhotra et al . press ) . Thus , DA blockade may interfere potential cognitive improvement associate antipsychotic drug treatment . Atypical antipsychotic higher 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 ( 5-HT2 ) D2 receptor bind ratio typical agent , therefore may effective treatment cognitive impairments.Unfortunately , limited data cognitive property new atypical agent , ziprasidone . In addition high 5-HT2 D2 receptor bind ratio , like atypicals , ziprasidone also weak anticholinergic effect minimal activity muscarinic ( M1 ) , histaminergic ( H1 ) alpha1-adrenergic receptor ( Casey , 2001 ) may also beneficially influence cognitive performance ( Byerly et al. , 2001 ) . Therefore , ziprasidone may unique ability improve cognitive performance patient schizophrenia . Evidence neuropsychology ( Gold , Carpenter , Randolph , Goldberg , &amp; Weinberger , 1997 ) , brain imaging ( Buchsbaum et al. , 1992 ) electrophysiology ( Shelley et al. , 1996 ) converge implicate impair work memory ( WM ) function schizophrenia . As , neural substrate subsume WM , temporal course information flow system , importantly whether ziprasidone intervention aid normalization function , critical issue schizophrenia research . In present study , propose integrate : 1 . A novel cognitive electrophysiological assessment specifically design detect subtle difference stag information processing WM deficits become manifest . 2 . A state art computerize neuropsychological battery assess WM cognitive domain . 3 . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) dopamine D2 receptor occupancy . These method provide mean specifically characterize effect ziprasidone cognitive performance dopamine blockade patient schizophrenia . The primary hypothesis test 1 ) ziprasidone treatment associate improvement WM , 2 ) WM performance associate D2 occupancy ziprasidone treat patient . Data collect context open label , randomize clinical trial compare efficacy ziprasidone atypical agent , olanzapine risperidone . This trial compare effect ziprasidone risperidone olanzapine positive negative psychotic symptom , mood , side effect , well provide first comprehensive data effect drug information processing , work memory dopamine D2 receptor occupancy . These pilot data allow u test hypotheses 1 ) ziprasidone associate improvement information process work memory . 2 ) ziprasidone associate improvement psychotic symptom mood . 3 ) ziprasidone associate improvement cognition behavioral symptom least significant associate treatment olanzapine risperidone . Finally , examine relative D2 occupancy drug use PET Subjects randomize drug treatment ziprasidone , olanzapine risperidone , 30 subject receive ziprasidone , 30 receive either risperidone olanzapine . Patients enter study risperidone history risperidone treatment within past 6 month randomize either ziprasidone olanzapine . Patients enter olanzapine history olanzapine treatment within past 6 month randomize either ziprasidone risperidone . Patients medication , history olanzapine , risperidone ziprasidone treatment , randomize three drug . Patients treat ziprasidone , time past , exclude . The final group consist 30 subject receive ziprasidone , 30 subject receive risperidone olanzapine depend treatment history . Target dose ziprasidone 160 mg/d dosage achieve within two week initiation drug treatment . Target dose olanzapine 20 mg/d dosage achieve within two week initiation drug treatment . Target dose risperidone 4 mg/d dosage achieve within two week initiation drug treatment . Dosage fix target dose remainder trial . Patients tolerate target dose continue study , feasible , maintain low dose . Extra-pyramidal side effect , , treat benztropine need . Concomitant medication permit . Patients re-assessed every month follow initiation treatment 3 month follow baseline . Subjects re-assessed information processing assessment , neurocognitive battery , behavioral side effect rating , information drug dosage compliance treatment visit . Moreover , subject ask participate PET study dopamine D2 occupancy third month visit . Trained raters blind patient 's drug condition conduct behavioral side effect rating . The cognitive electrophysiological assessment employ parametrically design A-X Continuous Performance Test ( AX-CPT ) task increase level difficulty proven elicit traditional behavioral measure WM function reaction time ( RT ) accuracy ( Bates et al , 2000 ) . This paradigm provide mean evaluate efficacy ziprasidone treatment remit cognitive dysfunction patient schizophrenia . However , accuracy RT index final motor response capture information antecedent stag information processing . Visual evoked response potential ( ERP 's ) collect subject perform AX-CPT task allow assessment early sensory registration stimulus ( N1 ) , time course subsequent cognitive analysis ( P3 ) ( Bates et al , 2000 ) . This methodology facilitate assessment stage information processing schizophrenia deficit WM become manifest . Topographical analysis ass whether schizophrenia patient display amplitude attenuation scalp sit correlate prefrontal cortex perform WM task , function improves course ziprasidone intervention . Visual ERP 's employ follow reason . Auditory P3 attenuation proven change administration typical neuroleptic longitudinal design ( Pfefferbaum et al. , 1989 ) . Visual P3 , however , may provide sensitive measure detect change illness severity though related clinical state ( Duncan , 1988 ) . The propose study could possibly reveal improved functioning go undetected study employ auditory ERPs . The propose study would first assess longitudinal effect ziprasidone treatment WM function use parametrically alter WM task concurrently obtain visual ERP 's . The neurocognitive battery employ task WM , executive functioning , memory , motor function verbal fluency . This paradigm provide mean evaluate effect ziprasidone treatment improve cognitive function across multiple domain patient schizophrenia . PET image [ carbon-11 ( 11C ) ] -raclopride provide vivo measure dopamine D2 receptor occupancy ziprasidone treatment use ass relationship ziprasidone 's D2 occupancy measure WM cognition . It hypothesize moderate D2 occupancy associate clinical improvement degree occupancy correlate WM performance . The [ 11C ] -raclopride study perform subset 30 patient twelve week ziprazidone treatment . As [ 11C ] -raclopride study D2 receptor consistently show comparable level bind control untreated patient schizophrenia ( e.g . Farde et al.1990 ) , treat patient compare untreated control . We use approach may feasible scan patient unmedicated state . It extremely difficult justify two four week drug free period would need assess baseline D2 receptor availability . The PET study perform PET Center North Shore University Hospital . On day PET scan intravenous line place antecubital vein radiotracer administration , draw plasma drug level time scan . The subject position General Electric ( GE ) Advance scanner . A fifteen-minute transmission scan obtain . Then , 15 millicurie ( mCi ) [ 11C ] -raclopride inject . Scanning begin immediately radiotracer injection last 60 minute . Radiotracer : [ 11C ] -raclopride relatively selective radiotracer dopamine ( D2/D3 ) receptor commonly use radiotracer normal control psychiatric patient ( e.g . Smith et al. , 1995 , Volkow et al. , 1994 , Farde et al. , 1990 ) . An magnetic resonance ( MR ) scan perform rule structural brain pathology , image registration PET scan correction effect cerebral atrophy . The MR scan perform GE Signa 1.5 Tesla scanner .</detailed_description>
