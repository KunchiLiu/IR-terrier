	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Acetyl L-carnitine prevent development nerve damage , know neuropathy , individual take anti-HIV drug 48-week period . In addition safety tolerability Acetyl L-carnitine assess . This study compare use Acetyl L-carnitine placebo ( dummy drug ) prevention nerve damage . The current standard care use painkiller manage pain , little effect . The possible beneficial effect take Acetyl L-carnitine prevent nerve damage result anti-HIV medication . The main purpose trial : - look difference Acetyl L-carnitine versus placebo - look effect state nervous system two treatment group measure nerve activity - learn safety tolerance Acetyl L-carnitine</brief_summary>
