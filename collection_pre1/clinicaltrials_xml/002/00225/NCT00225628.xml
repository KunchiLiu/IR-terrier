	<detailed_description>The evidence base practice medicine continue improve . However , abundant data show gap exist best evidence practice . Moreover , health care cost climb alarm rate . We propose ask three related question : 1 ) effective computer decision-support system improve compliance evidence-based guideline cost ambulatory set ; 2 ) impact guideline compliance application allow clinician track follow-up test result ; 3 ) main barrier acceptance guideline deliver via real-time clinical decision-support system . Our work others show computerized decision-support form alert reminder improve outcome reduce cost inpatient set . However , few data available outpatient setting . An elegant series study Regenstrief find certain computer-based intervention , display charge test , prior test result , likelihood particular test would abnormal , reduce outpatient utilization , reminder perform health maintenance procedure improve compliance . However , system still use broadly full potential computer-based technology remain test . Also , ample evidence physician always act optimally result patient study often remiss communicate satisfactorily patient result study . This situation may exacerbate increase patient volume face manage care . The ability computer assist track follow-up test result well communication patient remain evaluated . Even though benefit computer-based decision-support system document , system slow adopt . Moreover , even computerize guideline result demonstrable improvement , often improvement small anticipate . This proposal aim good understand barrier guideline acceptance benefit computer base decision-support realize . Our organization , Brigham Women 's Hospital , particularly good position study issue . We place highly developed clinical information system include outpatient electronic medical record ( EMR ) application active part clinical workflow since 1999 . The EMR application currently use primary care physicians one major medical center track patient â€™ problem , medication , allergy , health maintenance data . We develop new EMR use broadly across network , feature new interface added functionality . The new EMR allow u evaluate state patient time visit generate reminder patient compliance certain guideline . It also include outpatient order entry allow physician enter medication laboratory order directly computer . Decision-support order entry allow u guide physician decision make opportune time , evaluate result guidance . For automated decision-support application widely adopt , critical benefit demonstrate wide variety situation . We plan implement several different type intervention target various phase clinical workflow determine strategy achieve great benefit . Specific Aims : 1 . To evaluate effectiveness paper-based interactive computer-based alert reminder improve compliance guideline reduce cost ambulatory set . 2 . To evaluate impact computer-based track follow-up reminder system guideline compliance . 3 . To identify address patient , clinician , system barrier effective use computer-based clinical decision-support strategy diverse array clinical setting .</detailed_description>
