	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Recombinant Human Hepatocyte Growth Factor Fulminant Hepatic Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fulminant late-onset hepatic failure ( LOHF ) intractable disease high degree fatality ( 70-80 % ) . Only liver transplantation establish therapeutic modality rescue patient fulminant hepatic failure LOHF . However , approximately 75 % patient able receive liver transplantation Japan , effective non-surgical treatment establish yet . Hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) one major agent stimulate liver regeneration ameliorate hepatic injury . In study , recombinant human HGF administer patient fulminant hepatic failure LOHF , receive liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
