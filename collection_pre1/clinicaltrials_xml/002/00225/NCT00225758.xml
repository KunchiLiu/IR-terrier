	<brief_summary>Two third breast cancer dependent estrogen growth . We use number estrogen-blocking medicine treatment metastatic breast cancer . The treatment response agent unpredictable , however , approximately one-third patient metastatic breast cancer receptor estrogen progesterone benefit hormonal therapy . Nearly patient metastatic breast cancer eventually become resistant hormonal therapy despite fact hormone receptor still present . Some cell make different class growth factor receptor call Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor . There grow body experimental evidence show breast cancer cell make Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors resistant hormonal therapy poorer prognosis . Several investigator find Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor activate estrogen receptor , even presence estrogen-blocking drug . Growth cell slow blockade Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor signal estrogen-receptor signaling . Lapatinib small molecule inhibit two different form Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor . It study people number different cancer , include breast cancer , safe dose common side effect define . Our hypothesis Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor dominant receptor pathway use breast cancer patient hormone-resistant tumor . Drugs like lapatinib block several form Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor would best able reverse resistance hormonal agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient must stop endocrine two four week longer prior entry study . Upon enrollment , patient begin lapatinib 1500 mg day orally . The original endocrine therapy resume two week later . The lapatinib continue maximum 26 week . A history , physical examination , blood count , chemistry do baseline , regular interval course study . A CT scan bone scan do prior treatment week 14 26 . Assays plasma DNA perform blood sample baseline multiple time point throughout course treatment . Percutaneous biopsy take selected patient accessible disease , 72 hour less prior start lapatinib , 13-15 day , 27-29 day follow start lapatinib . The day 13-15 biopsy do prior resumption patient 's endocrine therapy . Assays phospho-ERK , phospho-Akt , Cyclin D1 , Ki-67 , IRS-1 perform conventional immunohistochemistry biopsied tissue .</detailed_description>
