	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) remain common cause maternal death develop world . VTE include two condition , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . DVT refers blood clot form deep vein , often legs and/or pelvis PE refers passage clots lung ( fatal ) . VTE 10 time common pregnant woman non-pregnant woman comparable age . More third pregnancy relate VTE occur 6 week delivery . When compare vaginal delivery , cesarean delivery increase risk pregnancy associate VTE three-fold . A medication call low molecular weight heparin sometimes prescribed pregnancy delivery prevent VTE . However , clinical practice varies ’ adequate research determine medication safe effective prevent VTE time . The potential benefit medication must also weigh cost possible side effect . The researcher conduct study ass effectiveness safety low molecular weight heparin woman moderate high risk VTE cesarean section . They monitor woman determine receive medication few blood clot . Participants also monitor closely side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The STOP CLOT Pilot Study : Study Low Molecular Weight Heparin High Risk Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) remain common cause maternal mortality develop world . VTE 10 time common pregnant woman non-pregnant woman comparable age . More third pregnancy relate VTE occur brief postpartum period ( 6 week ) . When compare vaginal delivery , cesarean delivery increase risk pregnancy associate VTE three-fold . Pregnancy associate VTE unique isolate iliac vein thrombosis likely long term morbidity ( post-phlebitic syndrome ) common . There absence randomize control trial ( RCTs ) thromboprophylaxis C-section guide practice . Many national society guideline thromboprophylaxis however evidence base compliance guideline poor . Thromboprophylaxis may associate adverse effect ( bleed , heparin induce thrombocytopenia , skin reaction ) , inconvenience cost . It critical efficacy safety thromboprophylaxis follow cesarean delivery assess well design conduct randomized trial . OBJECTIVES : We conduct randomize double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study . The pilot study seek answer question : Is randomize double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylaxis feasible moderate high risk woman post cesarean section DVT detect pelvic vein ( MRV ) leg vein ( leg compression ultrasound ) imaging ? Our ultimate goal determine : 1 . Is LMWH effective preventing postpartum DVT follow cesarean section woman moderate high risk VTE ? 2 . Is LMWH safe prevent postpartum DVT follow cesarean section woman moderate high risk VTE ? 3 . Is LMWH cost effective prevent postpartum DVT follow cesarean section woman moderate high risk VTE ? STUDY DESIGN : We propose randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study prophylactic LMWH woman moderate high risk VTE follow cesarean section . Eligible , consent randomize participant receive once-daily injection study drug ( 4,500 IU tinzaparin sodium ( Innohep® ; ) placebo ) within 6 24 hour postpartum continue 3 7 day postpartum . On day hospital discharge , bilateral leg image compression leg ultrasounds pelvic vein image MRV complete . The primary outcome adjudicate DVT document ultrasounds MRV day hospital discharge . Secondary outcome include symptomatic DVT PE , death PE , major minor bleeding , HIT six week postpartum period . All outcomes adjudicate independent committee expert blind study drug allocation . With sample size 134 patient 80 % power detect 50 % relative risk reduction primary outcome event rate large enough sample determine feasibility objective pilot study ( i.e . obtain precise estimate primary outcome event rate [ DVT ] , precise estimate multicentre recruitment rate , feasibility acceptability blind study drug placebo administration , feasibility obtain local study centre MRV central interpretation MRV preliminary relative risk reduction estimate study drug compare placebo inform final study sample size determination ) . RELEVANCE : Maternal mortality devastate outcome far reach emotional societal implication . Evidence guide thromboprophylaxis woman risk number 1 cause maternal mortality require .</detailed_description>
