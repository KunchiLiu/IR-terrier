	<brief_summary>Open-label study , anecdotal report , vitro scientific research indicate 4-methylumbelliferone ( active ingredient dietary supplement Heparvit® ) may prevent reverse symptom complication chronic infection hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . This effect observe among naïve patient well non-responders interferon , commonly use first-line therapy HBV HCV . In order scientifically address efficacy 4-methylumbelliferone chronic viral hepatitis , randomize , placebo-controlled , blind study need . It hypothesize 4-methylumbelliferone may reduce impact aggressiveness HBV HCV upon liver , thereby slow progression potentially life threaten liver disease cancer cirrhosis . This preliminary study design determine indication control condition may warrant detailed clinical study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>( ) . Chronic hepatitis B Chronicity HBV follow acute infection strongly age-related ; majority ( 90 % ) infants acquire HBV perinatally go develop chronic infection , person acquire HBV later life resolve infection [ ref 1 ] . Patients chronic HBV 15-25 % lifetime risk liver cirrhosis hepatic cancer . An estimated 5,000 people die year complication chronic HBV infection ( cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma ) . Three drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment chronic HBV : interferon-α ( IFN-α ) , lamivudine , adefovir dipivoxil . Only one-third chronic HBV patient develop sustain response IFN-α treatment , adverse effect common [ ref 2 ] . Use new orally-administered nucleoside analogue ( lamivudine adefovir dipivoxil ) typically cause rapid initial clearance virus associate few adverse effect ; however , seroconversion rate low , long-term therapy lamivudine ( require sustain response ) frequently result resistance [ ref 2 ] . Adefovir dipivoxil , far , show high rate resistance observe lamivudine , expect resistance eventually develop [ ref 3 ] . In summary , major problem currently approve therapy HBV include expense , toxicity , development resistance . ( ii ) . Chronic hepatitis C Chronic viral hepatitis due hepatitis C enormous medical problem , affect approximately 170 million people worldwide ( WHO ) [ ref 4 ] . In U.S. , estimate 2.7 million people suffer chronic HCV , 10,000-12,000 death per year attributable disease ( ref 5 ) . Chronic HCV infection U.S. usually acquire injectable drug use , sexual contact , receipt contaminate blood product ( antibody screen initiated 1990 ) . Most person expose HCV ( 75 % ) develop asymptomatic chronic infection . Eventually , 15 % -20 % die cirrhosis liver cancer without intervention [ ref 4 ] . Only two drug license treatment chronic hepatitis C : IFN-α ( standard pegylated ) ribavirin . Sustained response IFN-α monotherapy occur 35 % patient ; high response observe combination treatment ( pegylated IFN-α ribavirin ) [ ref 6,7 ] . Responses combination therapy closely link HCV genotype ( type 2 3 responsive ) . A significant number patient relapse respond standard treatment , retreatment typically less effective initial therapy [ ref 8 ] . ( iii ) . 4-methlyumbelliferone Umbelliferones ( 7-hydroxycoumarins ) [ ref 9 ] substance present many specie plant , especially umbelliferae , fabaceae , oleaceae , include common plant manna ash , sweet woodruff , German chamomile , celery , parsley , others . In nature , umbelliferones help protect plant cellular damage , infestation , trauma , infection . Their 7-hydroxycoumarin derivative ( 4-methylumbelliferones ) [ ref 10 ] use liver therapy , reagent , plant growth factor , sunscreen , choleretics , spasmolytic . They also use light-protective agent , calibration medical laser , analytical chemistry quantitation nitric acid . Products contain 4-methylumbelliferone active substance available USA Europe since 1990 , dietary supplement ( trade name Heparvit® , Heparmed® , DetoxPro® ) . These product promote support liver function improve detoxification . In many part Europe , product contain 4-methylumbelliferone also available drug , use spasmolytic choleretics [ ref 11 ] ( improve liver detoxification system increase bile production ) . 7-hydroxycoumarins also natural metabolite body play important role metabolism ethanol , chemotherapeutic drug , acetaminophen , anabolic steroid , hepatotoxic drug [ ref 12 ] . Indeed , measurement concentration 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide ( metabolic product 4-methylumbelliferone ) common assay determine level toxicity liver-toxic drug [ ref 13 ] . The broad potential medical benefit 4-methylumbelliferone hepatoprotectant , anti-inflammatory agent , chemotherapeutic agent , antiviral substance describe [ ref 13,14 ] . More recent study indicate 4-methylumbelliferone ( 7-hydroxycoumarin derivative ) may effective Helicobacter pylorus [ ref 15 ] , several type cancer [ ref 15-19 ] , Alzheimer ’ disease [ ref 20 ] .</detailed_description>
