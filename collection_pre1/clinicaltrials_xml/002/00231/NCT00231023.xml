	<brief_summary>This study evaluate three follow treatment option well diabetic macular edema : laser alone , steroid injection alone , steroid injection follow laser . Macular edema swell small central part retina - part retina use sharp , straight-ahead vision . Laser treatment treatment proven beneficial diabetic macular edema . It reduce swell lessens chance vision loss , improve vision . Triamcinolone steroid drug decrease inflammation scar . Injections drug decrease macular edema patient improve vision . Swelling may return , require repeat injection , know vision improvement permanent . This 3-year study examine compare benefit side effect treatment , alone combination . Patients 18 year age old diabetic macular edema may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure . At begin study : - Blood test measure HbA1C ( measure diabetes control ) . - Measurement blood pressure . - Eye examination assess visual acuity ( eye chart test ) eye pressure , examine pupil , lens , retina eye movement . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) measure retinal thickness . This test shin light eye produce cross-sectional picture retina . These measurement repeat study determine retinal thicken get good worse , stay . Photographs retina lens . A special camera bright flash use take photograph . Treatments Some patient one eye treat patient eye treat . The treatment give individual determine chance : - Triamcinolone acetonide injection alone . The steroid inject tissue around eye . Two injection procedure use study , differ location dose . Numbing drop place area inject steroid inject . - Laser treatment alone . The surface eye numb drops contact lens place eye laser beam application . Before treatment , patient may fluorescein angiography , picture retina take use yellow dye . The dye inject vein travel blood vessel eye . The camera flash blue light eye take picture show amount dye leakage retina . Treatments may repeat several visit . - Triamcinolone acetonide plus laser treatment . Patients receive steroid injection laser steroid injection first laser treatment 1 month later . Follow-up Patients return clinic follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 36 month , often need , initial treatment eye exam , measurement visual acuity , OTC . Photographs retina take 4- 8-month visit 1- , 2- 3-year visit . Fluorescein angiography may do 4 month . Blood pressure measure 1- , 2- 3-year visit , HbA1c blood test do 4 8 month yearly visit . Participants may ask complete questionnaire year vision medical condition . Treatment option discuss 4- 8-month visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy major cause visual impairment United States . Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) manifestation diabetic retinopathy produce loss central vision . Data Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study Diabetic Retinopathy ( WESDR ) estimate 15 year know diabetes , prevalence diabetic macular edema approximately 20 % patient type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , 25 % patient type 2 DM take insulin , 14 % patient type 2 DM take insulin . In review three early study concern natural history diabetic macular edema , Ferris Patz find 53 % 135 eye diabetic macular edema , presumably involve center macula , lose two line visual acuity two year period . In Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) , 33 % 221 untreated eye available follow-up 3-year visit , edema involve center macula baseline , experience 15 letter decrease visual acuity score ( equivalent double visual angle , e.g. , 20/25 20/50 , term `` moderate visual loss '' ) . In ETDRS , focal/grid photocoagulation eye clinically significant macular edema ( CSME ) reduce risk moderate visual loss approximately 50 % ( 24 % 12 % , three year initiation treatment ) . Therefore , 12 % treated eye develop moderate visual loss spite treatment . Furthermore , approximately 40 % treated eye retinal thicken involve center macula baseline still thicken involve center 12 month , 25 % treated eye 36 month . Although several treatment modality currently investigation , demonstrate mean reduce risk vision loss diabetic macular edema laser photocoagulation , demonstrate ETDRS , intensive glycemic control , demonstrate Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) . In DCCT , intensive glucose control reduce risk onset diabetic macular edema 23 % compare conventional treatment . Long-term follow-up patient DCCT show sustain effect intensive glucose control , 58 % risk reduction development diabetic macular edema DCCT patient follow Epidemiology Diabetes Interventions Complications Study . The frequency unsatisfactory outcome follow laser photocoagulation eye diabetic macular edema prompt interest treatment modality . One treatment par plana vitrectomy . These study suggest vitreomacular traction , vitreous , may play role increase retinal vascular permeability . Removal vitreous relief mechanical traction vitrectomy membrane stripping may follow substantial resolution macular edema correspond improvement visual acuity . However , treatment may applicable specific subset eye diabetic macular edema . It also require complex surgical intervention inherent risk , recovery time , expense . Other treatment modality pharmacologic therapy oral protein kinase C inhibitor antibody target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) investigation . The use intravitreal corticosteroid another treatment modality generate recent interest . However , use intravitreal corticosteroid generally reserve case DME least moderate loss visual acuity ( e.g. , bad 20/40 ) . This treatment generally widely use mild case DME due concern potential risk , particularly glaucoma cataract , relative potential benefit . Injection corticosteroid around eye ( anterior subtenon 's , posterior subtenon 's , retrobulbar ) use alternative intravitreal injection . Although data limit , presumed adverse effect eye low injection around eye compare eye . There also little data efficacy treatment . This study conduct collect pilot data safety efficacy peribulbar corticosteroid determine whether sufficient evidence efficacy merit conduct phase 3 randomize trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>SUBJECTLEVEL CRITERIA INCLUSION CRITERIA To eligible , follow inclusion criterion ( 14 ) must meet : Age great equal 18 year 1 . Patients less than18 year old include DME rare age group diagnosis DME may questionable . 2 . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes Documented diabetes ADA and/or WHO criteria 3 . At least one eye meet study eye criterion 4 . Able willing provide inform consent . EXCLUSION A patient eligible follow exclusion criterion ( 513 ) present : 5 . History chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . 6 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . Patients poor glycemic control , within last 4 month , initiate intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) plan next 4 month enrol . 7 .
