	<brief_title>A Study Radiation Therapy Paclitaxel Carboplatin Patients With Uterine Papillary Serous Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine papillary serous carcinoma ( UPSC ) uncommon , aggressive variant endometrial carcinoma high recurrence rate poor response therapy . It propensity metastasize throughout abdomen , similar serous carcinoma ovary . In fact , many patient disease apparently confine uterus microscopic intra-abdominal spread time diagnosis . Recurrences common pelvis well upper abdomen . After stag debulking gross disease , adjuvant radiation therapy recommend treat patient endometrial carcinoma high risk recurrent disease . High-risk feature include histologic cell type , grade , depth myometrial invasion , cervical extension , lymph-vascular invasion , adnexal involvement , intraperitoneal spread , positive peritoneal cytology , positive lymph node . Pelvic radiation limit local recurrence le 6.5 % . However , approximately 25-30 % patient high-risk feature receive radiation recur distant metastasis . Even patient treat whole abdominal irradiation risk extra-abdominal recurrence progression-free interval 7 8 month . Adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen study high-risk endometrial cancer , none demonstrate survival advantage . Doxorubicin , combination platinum , report 42 % response rate , high toxicity profile . Paclitaxel overall response rate 36 % patient advanced recurrent endometrial cancer . Platinum-based chemotherapy 28-42 % response rate . Retrospective study patient UPSC demonstrate response rate 35 % patient multiagent chemotherapy . In one study , median progression-free interval 30 month observe patient treat paclitaxel platinum adjuvant recurrent setting . Based finding similarity clinical success paclitaxel/platinum therapy patient ovarian serous carcinoma , combination warrant investigation prospective manner patient UPSC . Combination chemo/radiotherapy trial advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer ongoing . The optimal radiation modality , chemotherapeutic agent , sequence regimen treatment UPSC yet establish . A retrospective review 16 patient treated institution sequential use radiation `` sandwich '' paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy find one patient recur 16 month median follow-up 15 month ( range 6-33 month ) . The regimen well tolerate . Eight sixteen patient ( 50 % ) develop grade 3 neutropenia follow cycle 4 chemotherapy , two require 1 week treatment delay . There case grade 3 4 thrombocytopenia note . There febrile neutropenia hospital admission toxicity . There observed grade 3 4 non-hematologic toxicity . With median follow 15 month , observe late toxicity . Given favorable preliminary finding , support recently publish data documenting efficacy `` sandwich '' multimodality technique difficult uterine malignancy ( malignant mixed mullerian tumor ) , propose study combination chemotherapy radiation prospectively . Our aim well evaluate pattern recurrence possible benefit progression-free overall survival . Surrogate endpoint biomarkers ER/PR , HER2/Neu p53 correlate prognosis . In addition , fresh frozen tissue bank future cDNA microarray analyse UPSC tumor .</detailed_description>
