	<brief_title>A Study Efficacy Safety Topiramate OROS Controlled-Release Obese , Type 2 Diabetic Subjects Managed With Diet Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topiramate approve treatment obesity . Studies show immediate release formulation topiramate reduces body weight obese patient without type 2 diabetes . A novel controlled-release formulation topiramate use OROS® technology potential well efficacy safety treatment obesity . This double-blind , placebo control study evaluate effectiveness safety controlled-release formulation treatment obese subject type 2 diabetes . The study consist 2 screen visit , baseline visit , 7-week titration phase ( topiramate dose increase 25mg daily 175mg daily ) , 9-week maintenance phase , 2-week taper phase 2-week follow-up . Effectiveness evaluate percent change body weight , body mass index , anthropometric measurement ( waist hip circumference ratio ) . Safety evaluation ( incidence severity adverse event , physical measurement clinical laboratory test ) conduct throughout study . The study hypothesis topiramate 175 mg daily , administer OROS® controlled-release formulation , effective ( term percent reduction body weight baseline week 16 ) safe , compare placebo , treatment obese , type 2 diabetic patient manage either diet alone combine metformin . During titration phase , topiramate ( OROS® controlled-release formulation ) gradually increase 175mg daily mouth , dose maintain 9 week , slowly discontinue 2 week .</detailed_description>
