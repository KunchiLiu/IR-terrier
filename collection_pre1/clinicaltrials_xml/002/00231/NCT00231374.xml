	<brief_title>Measure Cerebrospinal Fluid ( CSF ) Pressure Variation With Patient Positioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers need myelogram spine part routine medical care ask study . A myelogram imaging study x-rays agent put spine show spinal fluid x-ray . It require insertion needle cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) inside spine . CSF bodily fluid bathe brain , spinal cord , nerve root . This study conduct measure CSF pressure change different patient positioning . We motivate research study well treat patient develop spinal fluid leak myelogram spine procedure . The tissue hold cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) call dura . During surgery procedure , dura develop tear . Dural tear result leakage CSF . CSF leak recognize complication spinal surgery . Currently , evidence whether specific postoperative spine position beneficial , especially cervical ( neck spine ) CSF leak . The process dural heal dural tear influence CSF pressure . High CSF pressure may inhibit dural healing . We want find patient position ( sit , lie , recline ) reduce CSF pressure . To , want attach pressure monitor needle normally place spine myelogram measure CSF pressure .</detailed_description>
