	<brief_title>Phase II Study Docetaxel + ZD1839 Elderly Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial design test efficacy tolerability standard chemotherapy agent , Docetaxel , combination oral agent , Iressa , elderly patient advance stage lung cancer . Current practice utilize two chemotherapeutic medication may result increased toxicity poor outcome elderly population . Treatment consist infusion docetaxel every 21 day four dos take Iressa every day . A computed tomography ( CT ) scan measure disease response two cycle . Response determine continuation treatment . Lab work collect every treatment . Side effect information also collect every visit . Once infusion phase study complete , maintenance phase take Iressa begin disease assessment occurs every two month . This period last disease progression demonstrate .</detailed_description>
