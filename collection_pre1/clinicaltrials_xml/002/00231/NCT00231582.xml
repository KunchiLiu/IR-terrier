	<brief_summary>High-dose chemotherapy ( HD-CT ) able circumvent platinum-resistance resistant/refractory germ-cell tumor ( GCTs ) , expectancy cure remain low . New strategy need new drug sequential approach . Patients relapse ( absolutely refractory Cisplatinum-based chemotherapy ) poor-prognosis GCTs schedule receive 2 cycle combine epirubicin paclitaxel follow 3 consecutive HD-CT support stem cell transplantation . One course combine Taxol , 360 mg/m² + thiotepa , 720 mg/m² , follow two ICE regimen ( Ifosfamide , 12 g/m² , carboplatin , AUC 20 , etoposide , 1500 mg/m² ) . This phase II study design Gehan method . The main objective study complete response rate . With aim view , plan enroll first step 14 patient insure complete response ( CR ) notice , study would stop inefficacy ( i.e. , CR rate lower 20 % ) . If one CR notice , protocol specify 45 patient include order reduce confidence interval ( CI ) CR rate . Secondary objective overall response rate ( RR ) , overall survival ( OS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate , toxicity toxic death rate . The statistical analysis do term intent-to-treat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-dose Chemotherapy With Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Poor Prognosis Germ-cell Tumors : TAXIF II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment design relapsed poor prognosis patient testicular extra-gonadal GCTs previously treat cisplatin-containing regimen . Poor prognosis patient define either relapsed/refractory patient one month cisplatin administration , whether course first-line CT salvage treatment , patient show evidence progression least 2 line cisplatin-containing CT ( i.e. , BEP VeIP ) . Eligibility requirement include follow criterion : age &gt; 18 year &lt; 65 , performance status &lt; 3 , histologically biologically documented GCTs , testicular , abdominal mediastinal tumor , measurable evaluable disease , life expectancy &gt; 3 month , normal cardiac , liver , renal function test , absence infection , HIV negative test , sign informed consent . All patient previously treat least one line cisplatin-containing regimen include refractory one two line ( ) cisplatin-based CT , relapse two line cisplatin-based CT. Non-inclusion criterion : patient 'BEYER ' score &gt; 3 , grow teratoma syndrome , possibility treat conventional cisplatin-based CT , previous HD-CT regimen . During initial evaluation : patient must clinical evaluation include measurement tumor marker level , image work . The tumor marker level determine every week sequence treatment ( normal level &lt; 10 ng/ml alpha-foetoprotein &lt; 2 mU/mL HCG ) . The tumor mass measure first two cycle induction/mobilization therapy end treatment . Chemotherapy , patient schedule receive 2 course front-line mobilization CT follow 3 HD-CT support PBSCT . The front-line treatment consist combination epirubicin , ( 100 mg/m² 30-minute infusion ) , paclitaxel ( Taxol , 250 mg/m² give 3-hour infusion ) , administer day 1 14 . These 2 cycle support filgrastim ( Neupogen ) , 5 µg/kg , twice day day 2 15 , respectively , apheresis perform day 10-13 24-27 . Apheresis stop least 9 x 106 CD34+ cells/Kg BW obtain 3 graft . A third cycle permit number CD34+ cell achieve first 2 cycle , provide patient responsive CT , reason decide upon investigator . The first HD-CT regimen consist association thiotepa , 720 mg/m² taxol , 360 mg/m² , administer continuous infusion 3 day ( D34 D36 ) . The first pack CD34+ cell infuse day 39 . The second third course ( ICE ) schedule day 62-66 90-94 respectively , consist combination etoposide ( 150 mg/m² twice day , 2-hour infusion , 5 day ) , ifosfamide ( 2 400 mg/m²/d 3-hour infusion , 5 day ) support sodium mercaptoethanesulfonate ( mesna , 30-minute infusion every 3 hour , 12-hour period , initiated time ifosfamide infusion ) , carboplatin ( AUC 4/d , 6-hour infusion , 5 day ) . Infusion PBSCs plan day 71 99 . During 3 high-dose therapy , G-CSF administer daily dose 5µg/kg , day PBSC infusion PMN recovery ( i.e. , PMN &gt; 1.5 x 109/L ) . Each ICE regimen delay PMN level le 1.5 x 109/L and/or platelet level le 100 x 109/L . Toxicity response therapy evaluate accord ECOG WHO criteria . The duration response calculate date document response date progression . The duration PFS OS calculate date inclusion date progression , death progression ( PFS ) , date death ( OS ) , accord Kaplan-Meier 's method . Survival curve establish accord classification propose BEYER et al . Progression , death treatment withdrawal protocol whatever reason consider treatment failure . Whenever possible , patient clinical partial response ( PR ) normal tumor marker ( PRm- ) propose surgery residual mass end whole procedure . Sequential procedure propose case multiple metastatic site . If surgery complete pathological examination show viable tumor , patient consider complete responder . If surgery complete pathological examination show persistent viable tumor , consider surgical complete response .</detailed_description>
