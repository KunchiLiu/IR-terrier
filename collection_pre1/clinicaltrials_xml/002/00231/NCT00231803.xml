	<brief_summary>Advanced kidney disease 's associated heart blood vessel problem become frequent . These problem markedly affect length quality life cost lot treat . Treatments know prevent development advance kidney heart disease . These treatment optimally apply current health system . This study aim identify people relatively early stage chronic kdiney disease . With participation people , study test whether nurse co-ordinated clinic involve medical kidney specialist , apply know treatment , reduce delay onset advance kidney disease heart blood vessel problem heart attack , stroke death , great extent usual care . The study also address issue cost associate care illness . The nature care provide heatlh care professional study see best achieve good health outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pilot study design two phase . The first phase intend provide data key point need address prior future funding application CIHR NHLBI . These application currently tentatively plan fall 2005 . The second phase pilot study intend completely establish feasibility successfully complete full trial examine issue contamination ability intervention generate difference group regard use efficacious therapy control modifiable risk factor , intermediate variable causal pathway clinical end-points full-scale trial . The second phase also address need describe operation experimental intervention thoroughly . Finally , second phase pilot study compare randomize study group regard short-term quality-of-life outcome . Phase1 1 . How long take recruit 100 patient per study site ? 2 . What recruitment strategy efficient ? 3 . How baseline characteristic recruit compare referred population , general population CKD ? 4 . How nephrologist nurse work together provide care intervention group ? 5 . What nature care provide nurse physician intervention group ? 6 . Is study nurse able manage patient load ? 7 . How much time resource need ) provide care , b ) carry study measurement ? 8 . Can health care resource use measured economic analysis ? Phase II 1 . What rate loss follow-up ? 2 . What overall estimate primary outcome event rate ? 3 . By one year follow-up , difference study group term : 1 . Protocol intervention use ( estimate contamination ) 2 . Proportion ) smoking ; proportion achieve ii ) BP , iii ) lipid , iv ) diabetes , v ) anemia , vi ) acidosis , vii ) mineral metabolism target 3 . Quality Life 4 . Satisfaction care andomized , parallel , two group , multicentre , clinical trial people CKD , without diabetes mellitus proteinuria . The intention roll pilot study full-scale trial pilot deem successful . A laboratory-based case find method use preferentially identify potential participant . This supplement practice-based case-finding approach necessary ensure recruitment representative population . Randomization central computer-based telephone process . Stratification center presence diabetes proteinuria . The intervention consist protocol guide , multiple risk factor chronic disease care model-like approach deliver trained nurse support nephrologist base nephrology clinic like set .</detailed_description>
