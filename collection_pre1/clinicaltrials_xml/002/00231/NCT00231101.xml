	<brief_title>Quetiapine Decreases Smoking Patients With Chronic Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY SYNOPSIS Study Design Number subject enrol : Forty patient ( Two group - 20 ) Number center : One Study design : Single-blind , Switching Paradigm Extension : None specifically , although patient good clinical response treatment probably maintain medication discretion treat psychiatrist normal hospital channel , therefore , desire , would possible formally re-evaluate condition later time . Duration study : Total duration subject participation : 14 week Duration study phase : Screening : 1-7 day Lead-in treatment risperidone : 2 week Switching phase : 50 % patient switch two-week period quetiapine Active two group treatment : 12 week Visit interval frequency : variable , depend measurement Weekly - dispense drug &amp; treatment team meeting Bi-weekly – lab &amp; certain side effect rating Monthly – efficacy measure side effect rating Baseline , Week 6 &amp; Week 12 – cognitive measure Recruitment/enrollment duration : Approximately 18 month Subject Population Specific subject population/disease state/disorder study : Patients DSM-IV schizophrenia ( sub-types , include schizoaffective disorder ) active heavy smoker ( least one pack cigarettes per day ) recruit . To include patient need receive adequate dose duration risperidone treatment ( monotherapy least 6 mg total daily three month ) less-than-optimal response treatment . Specifically , less-than-optimal response risperidone define Total PANSS Score 60 . Additionally , enroll clinically stable patient satisfy ongoing treatment patient judge treatment refractory ( use Kane ’ criterion ) . Subject setting : Norristown State Hospital inpatient enrol partial hospital program recruit . Partial : On ground Norristown State Hospital three partial hospital program administer Montgomery County Office Mental Health . These highly structured program allow u recruit subject outpatient live well-supervised program . Inpatient : Norristown State Hospital 1001 Sterigere Street Norristown , PA 19401 Study drug dosing : Flexible : To enrol , patient adequate treatment risperidone ( defined monotherapy least 6 mg total daily three month ) prior enrollment . For switched risperidone quetiapine , expect cross-titration take two week ( long titration may use necessary due high level risperidone ) . By end first week , risperidone reduce 50 % patient ’ original dosage , target dose quetiapine 400 mg total daily dose end first week . By end second week titration , risperidone discontinue , treat psychiatrist continue increase quetiapine target 600 mg total daily dose base his/her clinical judgement , reach 800 mg total daily dose end fourth week . A low dose possible due emergent side effect , patient able tolerate least 400 mg/day quetiapine drop study . Quetiapine dose BID . Comparator ( ) dosing : Flexible : As state , patient adequate treatment risperidone prior enrollment . It expect majority patient remain risperidone continue treat 6 mg/day dose , although treat psychiatrist able suggest lower dose due side effect increase dose necessary great efficacy . Any patient requiring le 4 mg/day 10 mg/day drop study . While risperidone usually dose per day basis , throughout switch phase study dose BID . The possibility exist once/daily versus twice/daily dose could factor influence medication compliance rate group , source bias . Twice/daily dose group would also help insure blind raters . It important note formal consensus exist regard milligram-to-milligram equivalency risperidone quetiapine . However , base personal communication Herbert Meltzer , M.D. , seem dose range think comparable ( 1 mg risperidone = approximately 100 mg quetiapine ) . Thus , ideal comparison 6 mg/day risperidone 600 mg/day quetiapine avoid criticism , although , final group mean dose finally determine basis individual patient treatment response emergent side effect . Other treatment program : There study related treatment program , although patient ( whether inpatient partial hospital patient ) continue receive usual hospital clinic care regular basis . It critical note , however , patient receive ancillary behavioural , psycho-educational , pharmacologic treatment smoke cessation enrol due inherent bias and/or uncontrolled variance introduce additional treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients ( male female ) 1865 year age must diagnose DSMIV schizophrenia ( subtype include schizoaffective disorder ) . 2 . Patients must show lessthanoptimal clinical response adequate course risperidone treatment must willing agree possibility receive quetiapine alternative treatment mild moderate psychotic symptom . We define adequate course treatment three month least 6 mg/day risperidone . We define lessthanadequate treatment Total PANSS Score 60 . 3 . Patients must active cigarette smoker . We define active cigarette smoking patient consume one pack cigarettes per day . Although standard define active cigarette smoker , experience high rate smoking activity hospital ward effect small elevation cotinine level even among “ nonsmoking ” patient second hand smoke . Therefore , want insure enroll “ heavy ” smoker . 4 . Patients must able fully participate informed consent HIPAA process , legal guardian able participate 1 . Patients adequate clinical response risperidone consider treat psychiatrist clinically stable . 2 . Patients judge treatment refractory , define document treatment failure 3 FDAapproved antipsychotic medication administer adequate duration sufficient dosage ( 6 week 1000 mg/day chlorpromazine equivalent ) . 3 . Patients time screen clinically significant akathisia ( Barnes global score &gt; 2 ) , Parkinsonian symptom symptom ( Simpson Angus total score &gt; 3 ) , significant EPS ( indicate treatment benztropine , lorazepam propranolol ) . 4 . ECG abnormalities consistent significant acute cardiac disease . 5 . History significant unstable hypertension screen examination outside range 90/60 140/90 , pulse outside range 60 100 beat per minute . 6 . Any history seizure primary CNS disease ( tardive dyskinesia extrapyramidal symptom psychotropic medication ) , comatose state , bone marrow depression , significant cardiovascular , renal hepatic disease , brain trauma , chronic obstructive lung disease and/or pulmonary emphysema , mental deficiency . 7 . Active drug alcohol addiction within past 3month period . 8 . Symptoms significant physical illness 4week period prior enrollment , exclude mild upper respiratory gastrointestinal disorder . 9 . Clinical laboratory finding indicate presence pathological condition judgment principal investigator . 10 . Having receive investigational drug 4 week precede study . 11 . Pregnant lactate patient exclude . Pregnancy must exclude laboratory test prior begin study . Female patient judge potential pregnancy ( sexuallyactive female use approve form contraception ) exclude . 12 . At serious suicidal risk .</criteria>
