	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Adjuvant Radiation Therapy With Ifosfamide Patients With MMT Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine sarcoma account 2-4 % uterine malignancy , yet responsible 26 % uterine cancer death . Mixed mesodermal tumor ( MMT ) , previously know carcinosarcoma , common uterine sarcoma United States . Prognosis patient generally grim due propensity early metastatic disease . Patterns spread hematogenous lymphatic dissemination . It note 66 % patient disease clinically confine uterus nodal metastasis time diagnosis . The majority patient die wide spread intra-abdominal pelvic disease within two year diagnosis . Pelvic failure occur 50 % patient . Adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy advantageous control local recurrence . One study report 26 % local recurrence patient treat surgery alone versus 14 % recurrence patient treat surgery adjuvant pelvic radiation . Although adjuvant radiation show benefit improve local control , find impact survival . This find likely attribute high incidence distant metastasis ( 85 % ) know occur disease recurrence . Multiple chemotherapeutic agent evaluate management advance , persistent recurrent uterine MMT . Response single agent therapy le 35 % active agent identify ifosfamide ( response rate = 34.8 % ) cisplatin ( response rate 17.9 % . The use chemotherapy adjuvant setting explore mean attempt impact incidence distant metastasis . The Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) evaluate ifosfamide/cisplatin adjuvant setting patient completely resect Stage I II uterine MMT . At minimum two year follow-up , 41 patient ( 53.1 % ) progression free 48 patient ( 73.8 % ) remain alive . The author conclude regimen suggest improved progression free interval perhaps even survival , compare historical control . The result trial lead randomization ifosfamide vs. ifosfamide/cisplatin , patient advance , persistent recurrent MMT measurable disease . In study patient treat Ifosfamide dose 1.5 g/m2/day five day every three week eight course . This administer Cisplatin dose 20 mg/m2/day . Unfortunately , regimen associate significant unanticipated toxicity mortality necessitate 20 % dose reduction ifosfamide 1.2 gm/m2 per day dose cisplatin . Results study identify statistically significant advantage progression free interval ( P = .02 ) ifosfamide/cisplatin group ( 9 month ) vs. ifosfamide alone group ( 4 month ) . There , however , significant difference survival ( P = 0.07 ) . The optimal sequence /or modality adjuvant therapy management MMT clearly remain establish . The rationale protocol `` sandwich '' pelvic radiation chemotherapy decrease distant metastasis . A retrospective review 10 patient treated institution sequential use radiation `` sandwich '' ifosfamide/platinum chemotherapy recently perform . Along cisplatin dose 20 mg/m2/day , ifosfamide dose select base necessary dose reduction GOG trial . An ifosfamide dose 1.2 gm/m2/day prior radiation , decrease 1.0 gm/m2/day follow radiation total 6 cycle , administer . Of 8 patient complete treatment , 1 patient recur 17 month median follow-up 18 month ( range 6-53 month ) . One two remain patient anterior abdominal wall recurrence 5th 6th cycle chemotherapy develop cerebral metastasis radiation therapy . Overall , regimen well tolerate . Six 10 patient ( 60 % ) develop grade 3 neutropenia absence GCSF , two require 1 week treatment delay . There case grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia note . There febrile neutropenia hospital admission toxicity . There observed grade 3 4 non-hematologic toxicity . With median follow-up 18 month , yet observe late toxicity . The concept sequential chemotherapy/radiation therapy/chemotherapy previously report . The chemotherapeutic agent employ trial cisplatin epirubicin report survival 74 % patient Stage I II MMT median follow-up period 55 month . Toxicity report tolerable 98 % patient able complete therapy . Sequential chemotherapy/radiation/chemotherapy also investigate high risk uterine tumor propensity distant local recurrence . A retrospective review 23 patient treat radiation `` sandwich '' paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy patient uterine papillary serous carcinoma find 5/23 ( 22 % ) recur median PFI 16.6 month ( range 12.1 - 23 month ) . The median follow-up 21 month ( range 10-45 month ) . Of patient remain disease-free , median PFI 21.4 month ( range 10-15 month ) . Toxicity acceptable regimen well tolerate . A prospective trial regimen presently ongoing without unexpected toxicity morbidity . The propose study sandwich radiation two active chemotherapeutic agent MMT identify date ( ifosfamide/cisplatin ) . By , attempt decrease local distant recurrence , may translate improved progression free interval possibly even extend survival .</detailed_description>
