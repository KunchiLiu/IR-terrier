	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether treatment topical omiganan effective treatment topical povidone-iodine prevent local catheter site infection catheter colonization patient central venous catheter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Omiganan 1 % Gel Preventing Catheter Infections/Colonization Patients With Central Venous Catheters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : This phase 3 , multi-center , randomize , Evaluation Committee-blinded study patient undergo noncuffed central venous catheterization use either single lumen multi-lumen catheter , catheter expect place least 48 hour longer 28 day . Patients randomize within 4 hour insertion first study CVC . The first study catheter patient must noncuffed ( nontunneled ) central venous catheter ( CVC ) . Additionally , catheter insert use povidone iodine prepare insertion site eligible become study catheter . CVCs insert either axillary , jugular , subclavian , femoral vein . Following first study CVC insertion , additional CVCs , well arterial catheter PICC line allow study catheter . Only catheter impregnate antimicrobial substance ( e.g . bond catheter , antimicrobial impregnate , silver tip , etc ) may use study catheter . Study catheter must skin/catheter interface ; example , introducers allow study catheter catheter , include CVC , insert introducer deem non-study catheter . Once patient randomize either treatment , study catheter receive treatment . NIH ( NCID ) and/or local hospital guideline follow maximal sterile barrier precaution . The catheter site disinfect use 10 % povidone iodine minimum 2 minute per establish CDC guideline prior catheter insertion . Patients randomize omiganan 1 % gel group receive application omiganan 1 % gel around catheter insertion site follow catheter insertion . Patients randomize povidone iodine group receive antisepsis treatment cleanse site povidone iodine dressing change . For patient group , catheterization site cover semitransparent dressing provide sponsor . Every 3 day dress change . Skin irritation , erythema edema assess well presence purulence , moisture , ecchymosis , abnormally warm tissue temperature and/or site pain/tenderness . Patients discharge study follow removal final study catheter study day 28 , whichever sooner . Patients legal representative contact least 28 day study discharge/withdrawal safety follow-up purpose .</detailed_description>
