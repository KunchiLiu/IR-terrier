	<brief_summary>The purpose research compare safety ability stimulate antibody ( part body proteins fight infection ) two influenza ( flu ) vaccine give child 12 35 month old . The two flu vaccine compare : trivalent inactivate influenza virus vaccine ( TIV ) , kill virus vaccine give shot license use child 6 month age older live attenuate influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) , live ( weaken ) virus vaccine license child 5 year old old give nose spray . The strain virus weaken cause typical influenza illness , may allow body develop protection flu . LAIV vaccine license child less five year age , therefore use study investigational . Participation approximately 7 month duration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Safety Immunogenicity Study Mix Match Licensed Flu Vaccine Flumist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-site study phase I , open-label , 4-arm trial evaluate 2 dos influenza vaccine separate 30 day . The vaccine either two dos single vaccine combination vaccine product . FluMist® , cold-adapted live attenuate influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) , administer intranasally via spray applicator . Administration FluMist child less 5 year age investigational . FluZone® , trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) license use child 6 month age old , administer intramuscularly ( IM ) anterolateral thigh muscle deltoid muscle . Healthy child , age 12 35 month old , representative population base vaccinate recruitment area , enrol study 3 site . The primary study objective compare safety immunogenicity two dos license TIV two dos license LAIV safety immunogenicity single dose LAIV boost dose TIV versus child receive initial dose TIV follow booster dose LAIV among child 12 35 month age . The secondary objective develop preliminary safety data combine vaccine regime , evaluate possibility single dose TIV either reduce potential common side effect LAIV reduce viral shed associate LAIV child evaluate LAIV `` primary '' dose vaccine TIV `` booster vaccine '' induce serum Hemagglutination Inhibition ( HAI ) antibody . Vaccinees follow post-vaccination safety , reactogenicity immunogenicity . Patterns viral shed assessed 4 day vaccination LAIV . A final 6-month post-dose two vaccination contact make serious adverse event data collection . Specifically , investigator assess ability LAIV prime secondary immune response TIV give booster vaccine , investigator evaluate TIV prim event LAIV booster vaccine . Control group include TIV/TIV LAIV/LAIV group . The primary outcome measure study : assessment post-dose 2 hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibodies 3 strain influenza contained vaccine , safety assessment vaccine combination vaccine . The secondary outcome measure include post-dose 1 HAI antibody titer viral shed intranasal vaccination live attenuate influenza vaccine . An additional secondary outcome assessment secretory Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A nasal wash sample manifest 1 2 dos vaccine . An additional outcome Cell Mediated Immunity 1 2 dos vaccine . Blood collect day 0 , 30 60 antibody detection . Nasal wash collect day 0 , 30 60 secretory antibody measurement . A throat nose swab sample collect day 3 5 post LAIV vaccination assess viral shed dictate presence illness symptom viral culture two week dose either LAIV TIV vaccine . Up 20 eligible participant enrol 4 vaccination group . As four-arm trial active vaccine administer two different dose route , blind study assignment . Study duration 3 year individual participant duration approximately 7 month .</detailed_description>
