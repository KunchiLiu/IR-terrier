	<brief_title>Effects 6-Months Physical Conditioning Program Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A high level physical activity might beneficial patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Several study indicate physical training might improve fitness lung function ( , least , slow decline lung function ) . However , long-term study compare effect among aerobic training , strength training training . Furthermore , motivation continue train little variation session show decline rapidly . Thus , adherence program may low . Finally , patient feel happy program . Therefore , home-based individualized sport program might best suitable achieve long term benefit . The MUKOTRAIN study multicenter randomize control trial determine effect home-based physical training patient CF . Comparisons : Study A ) Patients train aerobically 3 * 30 min per week ( supervised sport club near home ) addition baseline physical activity compare patient train upper low body strength 3 * 30 min per week ( supervised sport club near home ) compare patient maintain physical activity . The supervised intervention last 6 month , thereafter patient follow additional 18 month . Study B ) Patients ask participate sport activity least 3 * 60 min per week ( free choice activity ) addition baseline physical activity compare patient ask maintain baseline physical activity .</detailed_description>
