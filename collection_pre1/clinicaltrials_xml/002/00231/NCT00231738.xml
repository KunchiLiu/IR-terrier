	<brief_title>Protective Effect EPA Cardiovascular Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study many country include Finland , Italy , Japan , The Netherlands suggest increased intake dietary fish fish oil rich long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acid ( PUFAs ) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , inversely relate risk atherothrombotic disease , particular coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Results many prospective observational cohort study find diet rich marine PUFAs may protective major cardiovascular event , include mortality CAD , total cardiovascular death , all-cause mortality , nonfatal myocardial infarction . To date , study examine effect purify n-3 PUFA preparation human subject short observation period . The principle aim current study test hypothesis long-term use highly purified EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid : 1800mg/day ) , addition HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor , effective prevent cardiovascular event Japanese patient hypercholesterolemia .</detailed_description>
