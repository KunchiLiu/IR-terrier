	<detailed_description>VP4896 gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) agonist bind inactivates GnRH receptor pituitary gland . This decrease amount luteinizing hormone release pituitary . The hypothesis upon trial design luteinizing hormone cause Alzheimer 's disease . VP4896 decrease amount luteinizing hormone body , therefore , may decrease halt progression Alzheimer 's disease . This double-blind , placebo-controlled , study design ass safety efficacy VP4896 ( novel formulation leuprolide acetate ) treatment subject mild-to-moderate AD . The study duration 56 week . Approximately 555 participant recruit approximately 80 site United States , Canada , South America . The study drug administer every eight week 48 week period .
