	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Weekly Taxotere Topotecan Recurrent Gynecologic ( GYN ) Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometrial carcinoma common gynecologic cancer , account 6,500 deaths 2002 United States . There 128 % increase endometrial cancer death past decade mainly due recurrence . Although primary surgery without adjuvant therapy cure patient , effective therapy patient advance recurrent disease need . Due advance age patient population associate medical comorbidities , patient always ideal candidate experimental therapy explore dose intensity toxic agent . Treatment option advance recurrent disease limit . Cytotoxic therapy make little impact survival . Recent data demonstrate efficacy Topotecan advance recurrent endometrial cancer . A Phase II trial perform primarily New York Gynecologic Oncology Group ECOG find Topotecan active first line treatment metastatic recurrent endometrial cancer . The overall response rate 20 % 3/40 patient complete responder . A Phase II trial Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) 29 patient advanced recurrent endometrial cancer report 10 % overall response rate 5-day intravenous Topotecan . However , 55 % patient stable disease . Reported side effect mainly hematologic , specifically , neutropenia thrombocytopenia . Finkler Holloway report phase I/II trial use weekly Topotecan recurrent endometrial cancer . 23 % patient partial response therapy , decrease grade 4 neutropenia thrombocytopenia compare 5-day infusion . In pilot study examine role 5-day Topotecan uterine papillary serous carcinoma ( UPSC ) , Chambers et al . report 11 12 patient received Topotecan front-line therapy disease-free 13 month median follow-up . Anemia neutropenia manage effectively hematopoietic stimulating factor . Taxanes also report effective treatment advance recurrent endometrial cancer . Endometrial cancer cell line demonstrate sensitivity paclitaxel . Response rate 35 % -37 % report two separate phase II trial . Günthert et al. , report complete response Taxotere patient recurrent endometrial cancer . Taxotere agent well documented management advance ovarian cancer , response rate approximately 30 % platinum-refractory patient . Taxotere also demonstrate clinical response patient classify paclitaxel-refractory , confirm incomplete cross-resistance two agent . Based data , reason believe combination Topotecan Taxotere second-line setting may prove promise patient initially treat paclitaxel platinum-based therapy . Topotecan Taxotere know activity ovarian cancer patient . Recent weekly dosing schedule suggest similar activity ovarian cancer patient less toxicity . Ovarian cancer patient significant Taxane-related side effect , include neuropathy , well weekly Taxotere . Both Topotecan Taxotere document efficacy recurrent endometrial cancer , study , date , utilized combination treatment endometrial cancer . In addition utilize regimen phase II set recurrent ovarian cancer , propose phase II trial utilize combination treatment recurrent endometrial cancer . The justification include tumor type protocol know similar response rate Gynecologic tumor chemotherapy . The endpoint power design histologic type , subset analysis use tumor type completion trial . Because broad spectrum antitumor activity Topotecan Taxotere , several phase I/II trial conduct combination regimen . Lu colleague MD Anderson administer docetaxel ( Taxotere ) intravenously Day 1 follow bolus daily intravenous Topotecan day 1-3 subcutaneous Neupogen ( Filgrastim ) support day 4-13 . Dose limit toxicity regimen febrile neutropenia , recommend dose phase II trial docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV day 1 topotecan 1.4 mg/m2 IV day 1-3 Neupogen ( filgrastim ) 5 mcg/kg/d SC day 4-13 . Three 11 patient enrol experienced response combination ( 1 CR 1 PR nasopharynx cancer 1 PR SCLC ) . Aijaz colleague New York Medical Center conduct similar pilot study patient recurrent ovarian primary peritoneal cancer . In trial , patient receive docetaxel 80 mg/m2 IV day 1 topotecan 1.0 mg/m2 IV day 1-5 . The patient also receive Neupogen ( filgrastim ) 10-mcg/kg begin day 6 continue neutrophil count recover ≥ 10,000/mL . The regimen relatively well tolerate , neutropenia frequently report side effect . Preliminary antitumor activity impressive , 1 complete response , 4 partial response , 4 stable disease report among twelve patient enrol pilot study . A final phase I study combine topotecan docetaxel also conduct The University Wisconsin Stella colleague . In trial docetaxel administer IV day 1 follow daily IV bolus Topotecan day 1-5 . In contrast previous study , prophylactic growth factor support administer follow chemotherapy administration . Because significant myelosuppression initial dose level , protocol amend start dose Topotecan reduce . As expect , dose-limiting toxicity myelosuppression consist neutropenia thrombocytopenia . The maximum tolerate dose combination regimen docetaxel 60 mg/m2 IV day 1 follow Topotecan 0.75 mg/m2/d day 1-5 . Recently , combination Topotecan Taxotere use Phase I set platinum sensitive patient recurrent ovarian primary peritoneal cancer . Eleven patient treated date weekly docetaxel 30 mg/m2/wk plus topotecan 3.5 mg/m2/wk . Two patient non-evaluable , one due rapidly progressive disease one due noncompliance . Of nine evaluable patient , five patient experience dose-limiting toxicity follow , 1. cycle 1 day 15 ( C1D15 ) hold due platelet 33K heavily pretreated patient , include previous oxaliplatin , 2 . C1D15 dose decrease due grade 3 diarrhea , 3 . C1D8 hold due grade 3-4 nausea vomiting ( may disease relate ) , 4 . C1D15 hold due platelet 49 K ( 74 yo , heavily pretreated include previous XRT ) , 5 . C1D15 hold due platelet 43K decline creatinine clearance 43 ml/min ( 3 prior regimen , include XRT , PS 2 history thrombocytopenia ) . One additional patient plan complete dose level , provide 10 evaluable patient . Of 36 patient receive 76 cycle therapy , myelosuppression brief reversible febrile neutropenia . Per verbal communication Dr. Burris , recommend phase II dose docetaxel 30 mg/m2/wk plus topotecan 3.5 mg/m2/wk day 1 , 8 15 every 28 day minimally pretreated patient . In addition possible synergy combination drug tumor type , weekly dosing may better safety profile . The dose-limiting toxicity Topotecan administer daily x 5-administration schedule myelosuppression . However , drug administer weekly administration schedule , myelosuppression ameliorate long dose limiting . Additionally , weekly docetaxel administration gain popularity clinical arena due improve toxicity profile drug . The possibility synergy improve safety profile secondary weekly dosing make combine dose regimen rational possibility patient population .</detailed_description>
