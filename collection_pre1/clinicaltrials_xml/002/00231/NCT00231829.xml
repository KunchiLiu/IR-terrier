	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Celecoxib Patients With Grade 2 3 Uterine Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometrial cancer common gynecologic cancer United States . The number deaths endometrial cancer rise 128 % since 1987 . In 2001 , estimate 38,300 woman develop endometrial cancer ( ACS Facts Figures ) estimate 6,600 woman die endometrial cancer . Preinvasive well-differentiated endometrial cancer hormonally driven often cured surgery alone . Higher-grade tumor usually hormonally driven proliferate via unknown mechanism . These tumor largely responsible rise death rate . Responses toxic treatment protocol recurrent endometrial cancer dismal . Unfortunately , post-menopausal woman also often comorbidities , limit eligibility current chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment . Expression COX-II identify many human cancer include : colon cancer , gastric cancer , esophogeal cancer , bladder cancer , head neck cancer , liver cancer , pancreatic cancer , prostate cancer breast cancer . COX-II expression also strongly express primary tumor metastasic site human cervical cancer . COX-II may influence cell cycle control upregulating proliferative capacity neoplastic endometrial cell . Furthermore , COX-II inhibitor inhibit tumor proliferation even cell express COX . This suggest alternative mechanism action yet define may play role inhibit growth cancer tissue . The enhanced expression COX-II lead investigator use COX-II inhibitor prevention and/or treatment colon prostate cancer vivo vitro . Celecoxib FDA approve chemoprevention colon cancer familial adenomatous polyposis patient . If show COX-II downregulated COX-II inhibitor endometrial cancer , may offer similar chemopreventative chemotherapeutic potential already proven colon cancer . COX-II enzyme activity may always correlate end organ gene expression . Multiple gene implicate apoptotic pathway affect COX-II inhibitor . NS-398 , selective COX-II inhibitor cause elevation APC expression downregulation c-myc . Prostate apoptosis response 4 ( Par-4 ) level increase cell treat COX inhibitor . PTEN hMLH1 gene implicate malignant transformation endometrial tissue . 5-Lipooxygenase ( 5-LOX ) often correlate COX-I COX-II . Thus , addition COX-I COX-II , good candidate gene study effect COX-II inhibitor uterine cancer . Preliminary Data Since COX-II expression see endometrium hormonally-dependent tumor , investigated expression COX-II endometrial cancer . Our preliminary study 41 fixed sample benign neoplastic endometrium reveal COX-II express benign endometrial tissue , stain minimally ( ~1 % tumor cell ) well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma , stain strongly poorly-differentiated carcinoma ( ~12 % tumor cell , stain strongly ) . COX-II express poorly differentiate uterine cancer . Our study also demonstrate COX-II also strongly express uterine papillary serous carcinoma ( UPSC ) well clear cell carcinoma uterus . These finding confirm Ferrandina , et al . A small percent patient well patient Ferrandina study 1+ 1-5 % staining . These 'low-expressers ' make 1/13 ( 7.7 % ) patient . COX-II expression endometrial carcinoma slight inverse correlation apoptosis ( r=-0.534 ) . However , COX-II expression endometrial carcinoma correlate lymphovascular invasion ( r=0.69 ) depth invasion ( r=0.68 ) . There correlation COX-II expression ER ( r=0.03 ) PR ( r=-0.02 ) . The presence poorly-differentiated tumor may imply hormonally-independent pathway result de-differentiation . In summary , preliminary data reveals COX-II expression high grade 2 3 endometrioid-type endometrial cancer , well UPSC clear cell subtypes correlate known clinical prognostic factor . Expression COX-II identify many type human cancer . Uterine cancer common gynecologic cancer US increase uterine cancer death past decade mainly due difficulty treat recurrence aggressive histologic type . The study co-investigators also identify COX-II expression grade 2 3 endometrioid-type , clear cell , papillary serous type uterine cancer . Upregulation COX-II may control cell cycle regulate proliferative capacity neoplastic endometrial cell . This Phase II pre-post intervention comparison study eligible patient look effect COX-II inhibitor uterine cancer . The patient whose endometrial biopsy show grade 2 3 endometrioid-type , clear cell , papillary serous type uterine cancer put selective COX-II inhibitor , Celebrex ( Celecoxib ) day surgery . The expression COX-II p21 quantify treatment Celecoxib eligible patient . This expression evaluate perform immunohistochemical stain endometrial biopsy ( pre-intervention ) hysterectomy specimen ( post-intervention ) . Apoptosis , evaluate terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT ) -mediated dUTP- digoxigenin nick end-labeling ( TUNEL ) assay , also evaluate compare COX-II expression endometrial cancer two specimen , endometrial biopsy ( pre-intervention ) uterus ( post-intervention ) . In addition IHC analysis apoptosis , gene expression COX-related gene post-intervention uterine specimens . This gene expression compare match control treat COX-II inhibitor . COX-II expression correlate establish clinical prognostic factor include lymphovascular invasion , depth myometrial invasion lymph node involvement . We hypothesize Celecoxib downregulate expression COX-II tumor type similar tumor . We also hypothesize apoptosis , measure TUNEL assay , increase area less COX-II expression inversely proportional cellular p21 expression . Additionally , COX-II inhibitor affect apoptotic pathway even cell express COX-II . For low express cell , COX-II inhibitor activity may well document apoptosis . We hypothesize COX-related gene expression alter thus suggest up- down-regulation gene end-organ tissue . Documenting downregulation COX-II enzyme alter gene expression endometrial carcinoma treatment Celecoxib may result prospective study use selective COX-II inhibitor effective , well-tolerated chemotherapeutic agent uterine cancer resistant many current therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must least 18 year age Histologically confirm uterine cancer follow histologic type : grade 2 grade 3 endometrioidtype , clear cell , papillary serous type . The pretherapy sample come either endometrial sampling ( e.g . pipelle ) dilation curettage uterus without hysteroscopy . Unstained slide primary tumor , primary tumor block , cytologic preparation must available review . COXII expression see majority patient tumor type . Effects COXII inhibitor occur even absence COXII expression measure IHC staining , apoptosis study gene expression . Therefore , patient test COXII expression preoperatively order include study . Disease status : Only patient clinical stage I stage II disease eligible . Negative urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ( within 14 day initiation Celebrex ) . All eligible patient need Zubrod/ECOG/GOG performance status â‰¤2 permit surgery , without stag , indicate . All patient must inform investigational nature study must sign give write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . Celecoxib contraindicate patient know hypersensitivity Celecoxib . Celecoxib give patient demonstrate allergictype reaction sulfonamide . Celecoxib give patient experience asthma , urticaria , allergictype reaction take aspirin NSAIDs . Concurrent therapy : Patients daily usage form NSAID aspirin prior endometrial biopsy exclude study . Selective COXII inhibitor activity gastrointestinal mucosa . Although Celecoxib contraindicate patient peptic ulcer disease , patient exclude avoid untoward gastrointestinal side effect . There information regard use Celecoxib patient advance renal disease . Therefore , treatment Celecoxib recommend patient . Patient impairment hepatic , renal hematologic function define follow baseline laboratory value perform &lt; = 4 week prior study : Serum SGOT and/or SGPT &gt; 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( IULN ) .
