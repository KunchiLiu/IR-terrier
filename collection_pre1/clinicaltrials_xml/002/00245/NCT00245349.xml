	<brief_summary>Preliminary observation suggest positron emission tomography ( PET ) image F-18 label thymidine analog ( FLT ) selectively identify proliferate non-proliferating tissue , include tumor . FLT uptake tumor appear reflect level cell undergoing DNA synthesis . This clinically important cell proliferation marker significant prognostic value , prior initiate radiotherapy change course therapy . In proposed study , researcher assess biodistribution radiation dosimetry FLT obtain necessary data file Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The information collect Radioactive Drug Research Committee ( RDRC ) approval use diagnostic purpose , ass subject 's response therapy , clinical management subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Calculate Radiation Dosimetry Subjects With Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 40,000 new case head neck cancer year United States . Worldwide 500,000 individual develop head neck cancer year , rank sixth common cancer . These cancer predominately squamous cell cancer . Approximately two third subject present locally advanced disease either large disease primary site and/or spread regional lymph node level . Despite aggressive treatment , 5-year survival remain poor ( overall , approximately 50 % ) . The major site treatment failure within head neck region , distant metastasis occur approximately 25 % subject usually local and/or regional ( nodal ) failure . Current treatment option locally advanced head neck cancer include combination surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy . It currently difficult predict combination best suit particular individual . Rapid method assess response subject chemo-radiotherapy would useful tool , would permit oncologist change therapy , either type degree , case subject respond initial therapy regimen . Current best method evaluate tumor response either serial CT examination , change tumor size estimate fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) study change metabolic status tumor evaluate . Unfortunately , anatomic information afford CT examination often require month treatment allow full effect therapy take place . Even time , metabolic activity remain tissue nearly impossible assess CT scan , make difficult distinguish fibrosis viable tissue . Generally FDG study require 3-4 week end therapeutic regime relevant information available , reliable information obtain 3-4 month treatment . It predictable immediate signal anti-tumor therapeutic regime successful tumor cell stop dividing ( proliferate ) therapy initiate . Therefore , tracer take retained cell function proliferative activity provide rapid information effectiveness treatment . It objective study determine biodistribution radiation dosimetry tracer F-18 3 ` -deoxy-3 ` -fluorothymidine . This distribution data essential Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application file FDA would allow use tracer clinical trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 2 . Subject must histologically confirm stage III , IV squamous cell carcinoma head neck whose primary origin oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx . Carcinoma must stag use American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) stag criterion version 6 . Adequate tumor must amenable biopsy via outpatient method , therefore majority subject oropharyngeal lesion . 3 . Subjects must schedule receive combine chemoradiotherapy treatment standard cancer care . Treatment decision make treat otolaryngologist , radiation , medical oncologist . 4 . Males female great equal 21 year age . Squamous cell cancer head neck exceedingly rare child generally applicable pediatric population . 5 . Karnofsky score great equal 60 % time screen . 6 . Life expectancy great 6 month . 7 . Subject must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte great equal 3,000/microL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL platelet great equal 100,000/microL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit BUN within normal institutional limit PT PTT &lt; 2.0 X upper normal limit 8 . The effect FLT develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A screening urine hCG administer woman childbearing potential FLT scan . 1 . Subjects chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 2 . Subject may receive investigational agent . 3 . Subject Karnofsky score 60 . 4 . Pregnant woman exclude study . FLT PET potential teratogenic effect . Because potentially unknown risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother FLT , breastfeed discontinue mother imaged FLT may resume 48 hour FLT image . 5 . Subject inadequate marrow reserve determine history and/or test . 6 . Subject bleed clot dysfunction determine medical history test . 7 . Subjects take nucleoside analog medication use antiretroviral agent . 8 . Inadequate tumor volume allow 2 biopsy .</criteria>
