	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Metastatic , Locally Advanced , Recurrent Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary endpoint response rate ( CR+PR ) stratum sarcoma patient treat sorafenib defined RECIST . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Progression-free survival ( define CR + PR + SD , assess 3 month 6 month ) . II . Overall survival . III . Pharmacokinetics sorafenib patient population ( site participate ) . IV . Frequency B-raf mutation patient ' sarcoma treat part study correlation response resistance sorafenib ( site participate ) . V. Ras-raf kinase pathway activation pre-treatment exist tumor specimen ( paraffin section immunohistochemistry ; site participate ) . VI . At MSKCC : Pre post treatment specimen change downstream event ras signal , specifically inhibition ERK phosphorylation . Only patient angiosarcoma MPNST undergo biopsy ( 10 patient ) . VII . At MSKCC : Circulating Endothelial Cells ( CECs ) , VE-cadherin level , soluble protein level ( VEGF , bFGF , endostatin ) measure angiogenesis start sorafenib therapy . OUTLINE : This open-label , non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord sarcoma histology ( angiosarcoma v malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor v leiomyosarcoma [ close accrual 11/29/06 ] vs high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [ i.e. , malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( include myxofibrosarcoma ) ( close accrual 11/29/06 ) ] vs synovial sarcoma ( close accrual 11/29/06 ) v type sarcoma ) . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
