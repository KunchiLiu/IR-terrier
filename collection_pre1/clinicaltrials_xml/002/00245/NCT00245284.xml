	<detailed_description>This study enroll 600 asymptomatic subject low ( &lt; 6 % ) , intermediate ( 6-20 % ) , high ( &gt; 20 % ) 10-year Framingham global cardiovascular risk approximately equal proportion . Subjects enrol three risk level study site ( 6 total US ) . Subjects enrol consecutive manner 200 subject risk level . We track number subject risk stratum . We also ensure adequate representation woman ( least 33 % ) African Americans ( least 25 % ) study . We test subject 2 non-invasive skin cholesterol test take sample blood test serum cholesterol value marker CAD . Subjects also undego carotid IMT scan . The primary objective study see skin cholesterol correlate CAD , measure CIMT .</detailed_description>
