	<brief_summary>The purpose study provide early access TMC114 ( protease inhibitor ) HIV-1 infected patient limit treatment option , fail multiple antiretroviral ( ARV ) regimens , evaluate longer-term safety tolerability TMC114/r combination antiretrovirals</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMC114-C226 : An Early Access Program Evaluate Long-term Safety Tolerability TMC114 Combined With Low Dose Ritonavir ( TMC114/r ) With Other Antiretrovirals , HIV-1 Infected Patients Who Have Failed Multiple Antiretroviral Regimens .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This program provide early access TMC114 ( protease inhibitor ) HIV-1 infected patient , fail multiple antiretroviral ( ARV ) regimens ineligible participation Tibotec-sponsored HIV trial . Patients need least 3 class experience ( PIs , NRTIs , NtRTIs , NNRTIs FI ) , previously receive 2 different protease inhibitor-based regimen virologically suppress current regimen . Patients eligible Tibotec sponsor HIV trial locate 100 kilometer away study site , consider eligible early access program . This program conduct open-label , non-randomized treatment study . Once treatment TMC114/r combination antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) initiate ( baseline visit ) , patient follow recommended visit schedule base routine clinical care . No protease inhibitor combination TMC114/r use study , except atazanavir ( ATV ) indinavir ( IDV ) may allow . Trial medication dispense every 8 week . Treatment TMC114/r continue treatment-limiting toxicity , loss follow-up , patient 's withdrawal , pregnancy , discontinuation TMC114 development TMC114 become commercially available . Selected safety tolerability data , include adverse event collect throughout study . A urine pregnancy test repeat baseline female patient 4 week pass since test screening , urine pregnancy test perform visit . In addition , data CD4 count viral load collect treatment period accord local standard care practice , order ensure patient continue benefit treatment TMC114/r . A final/withdrawal visit well post-trial treatment follow-up contact ( 4 week final/withdrawal visit ) perform . Patients take oral dos 600 mg TMC114 twice daily combination 100 mg ritonavir twice daily , combination antiretrovirals .</detailed_description>
