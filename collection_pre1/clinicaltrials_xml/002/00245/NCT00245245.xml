	<brief_summary>The ability new recombinant porcine coagulation factor VIII , B-domain delete ( call `` OBI-1 '' ) , control non-life- limb-threatening bleeding episode patient hemophilia A commonly develop evaluate . Patients congenital hemophilia A low-titer ( &lt; 20 Bethesda unit [ Bu ] ) inhibitory antibody OBI-1 , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , receive OBI-1 treat soft tissue joint bleeding episode . At least first two treatment episode perform controlled setting hemophilia center/clinic/office , side effect observe . If patient continue meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , serious severe adverse reaction OBI-1 , home care program , investigator may permit patient self-administer OBI-1 home treat subsequent bleeding episode . The study continue least 12 patient receive least 24 treatment episode aggregate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Recombinant Porcine Factor VIII ( FVIII ) Hemophilia Inhibitors FVIII</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate hemostatic activity OBI-1 control bleed episode hemophilia A patient inhibitor experience non-life and/or non-limb threaten bleeding episode . The secondary objective study ass : - safety OBI-1 , - serial anti-OBI-1 anti-human factor VIII ( fVIII ) inhibitor antibody responses follow therapeutic administration OBI-1 , - pharmacokinetics OBI-1 administer control bleed episode . After qualify study Screening visit , patient come investigator treatment qualify bleed episode . After baseline blood sample take inhibitor titer , Loading Dose OBI-1 , calculate inactivate inhibitor , administer intravenously . After blood sample drawn measure inhibitor titer fVIII level , Treatment Dose 50 U/kg administer . Serial blood sample draw fVIII level pharmacokinetics . At 6-hour interval , additional Treatment dos , increase dose level 150 U/kg , may give need . Follow-up safety evaluation , begin Day 14 , schedule ; inhibitor titer human fVIII OBI-1 measure assess continue eligibility . A second qualifying bleed episode treat first , without pharmacokinetic sample . If patient 's inhibitor titer OBI-1 rise &gt; 20 Bu , treatments OBI-1 suspend titer decrease 20 Bu low . Third subsequent treatment episode may self-administered patient , strict supervision investigator , home care . The study continue least 12 patient receive least 24 treatment , unless Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) recommend change dose calculation sooner .</detailed_description>

Patients ineligible participate follow present : Current treatment plan acute bleed episode incorporates use human fVIII ( recombinant plasmaderived ) . Presence life limbthreatening bleed episode ( define ) Patient receive human fVIII prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) , within 7 day prior Screening , OR receive PCC within 7 day prior treatment OBI1 . Patient receive recombinant human fVIIa ( rVIIa ) within 3 day prior Screening OR within 3 day prior treatment OBI1 . Significant liver disease renal disease</criteria>
