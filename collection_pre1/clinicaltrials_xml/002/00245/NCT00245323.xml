	<brief_title>Checking Smoking Status Routine Vital Sign : A Cluster-Randomized Trial Its Effect Cessation Counseling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two national clinical practice guideline ( CPGs ) advise primary care physician implement office-wide system screen record tobacco-use status every patient every office visit . These guideline specifically recommend check smoking status vital sign . This track system elegantly simple : As prompt physician , nurse staff record patient 's response brief inquiry smoking status ( current , former , never ) vital sign data . Scientific evidence measure increase physician counsel smoke cessation limit . The propose study evaluate effectiveness vital sign intervention practice-level randomize controlled trial . 18 practice recruit 9 month study . Eligible practice include primary care practice ( family practice internal medicine ) average two full-time equivalent provider ( include physician assistant nurse practitioner ) , already use ( plan institute study period ) practice-wide tobacco identification reminder system , willing participate study . Data collection occur two phase ; baseline post intervention . The purpose baseline data collection provide baseline counsel rate office prior randomization . Over course data collection period , research assistant ( RAs ) visit individual practice rotate basis ( 16 visit per site average ) . On average , practice visit week baseline month twice month intervention phase . The frequency visit adjust ongoing fashion PI , practice small number provider , low prevalence smoker , low survey participation rate necessitate proportionally visit keep data collection balance site . The RA recruit patient follow interaction provider participate one page in-office survey . Upon return in-office survey , self-identified adult current smoker visit physician day recruit participate 4 page mail-back survey . Both survey anonymous . A matching key code record return in-office survey patient give mail-back survey allow link analysis , maintain complete patient anonymity . Following baseline data collection , practice match cluster ( baseline cessation counsel rate ) randomize within cluster intervention control . In intervention practice , research coordinator work office manager implement appropriate method record vital sign practice . To facilitate timely implementation , research coordinator begin discussion practice early study implement smoothly randomization determine . Depending practice currently record routine vital sign document visit chart , smoke vital sign could implement stamp visit note , modification form and/or progress note paper , modification vital sign flow sheet . Immediately prior implementation smoking vital sign 9 intervention practice , research coordinator conduct in-service training session practice ’ nursing staff . For six month intervention period intervention practice , nurse staff record patient 's response brief inquiry smoking status ( current , former , never ) vital sign data . This information assess routinely adult patient visit practice . With exception nurse staff assess record smoke vital sign , work data collection do VCU research staff . No intervention providers do . During six month intervention period intervention site , office nursing manager provide periodic report often patient ’ report ask whether smoke ( measure implementation intervention ) ask share nursing staff practice ’ usual QA/QI mechanism reinforce continue performance intervention . Taking account cluster design , statistical significance primary secondary hypothesis test hierarchical logistic regression use SAS Sudaan statistical software . The mean rate intervention practice compare mean rate control practice . Temporal trend patient report intervention performance ( ask smoking status ) rate cessation counsel intervention control practice portray time-series graph . A repeated-measures design incorporate categorical model test statistical significance temporal trend . Secondary data analysis examine possible influence visit smoking-related factor , provider , patient demographic , health status add covariables categorical model . Resolving scientific uncertainty vital sign 's effectiveness important . Tobacco remain leading cause death disability country . Few practice adopt vital sign type tobacco track reminder system . Evidence intervention increase physician counseling smoker would therefore argue change current practice pattern . If vital sign intervention effective , expectation practice adopt ( recommended CPG ) may misguide . Increasingly , primary care physician encourage modify practice incorporate quality-of-care intervention lack scientific evidence effectiveness . Using randomize controlled trial test effectiveness guideline , include evidence-based , necessary insure relevant useful apply typical primary care practice .</detailed_description>
