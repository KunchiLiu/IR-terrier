	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic inflammatory bronchial condition unknown etiology . Decades ago many clinician believe infection play major role asthma etiology , current expert opinion favor view asthma noninfectious condition whose root cause inflammation . Therefore chronic antiinflammatory therapy , mainly inhaled corticosteroid , currently advocate primary anti-asthma treatment . It important recognize , however , antiinflammatory therapy palliative , curative . A grow body evidence implicate chronic bronchial infection Chlamydia pneumoniae pathogenesis asthma adult child . Organism identification study ( culture PCR ) suggest one-half child asthma may chronically infect C. pneumoniae , seroepidemiologic study adults consistent chronic C. pneumoniae infection majority adult-onset asthmatic . Furthermore , case report uncontrolled trial provide provocative inconclusive evidence treatment C. pneumoniae infection child adult asthma favorably affect natural history disorder . We propose randomize , placebo-controlled , triple-blinded study antichlamydial antimicrobial therapy adult-onset asthma . Results help determine whether antimicrobial therapy effective treating adult asthma syndrome . Positive result would significant public health implication . Methodologies develop use trial may expedite future study practice-based research network .</detailed_description>
