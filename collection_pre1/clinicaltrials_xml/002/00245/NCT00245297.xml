	<detailed_description>Each subject receive treatment three bleed episode ( `` wash-in '' , demand injection ) follow minimum 4 day wash-out . Following subject randomize specific treatment order . Each order consist four identical block . In block follow three injection give : 1 One prophylactic treatment ( randomized solution dissolution ) 2 3 . Two standard on-demand treatment spontaneous bleed episode ( standard Kogenate FS ) . Each block follow four day wash-out . In total subject receive 3+4x3=15 injection . It estimate subject study 4 month . A treatment spontaneous bleed episode may require one infusion .</detailed_description>
