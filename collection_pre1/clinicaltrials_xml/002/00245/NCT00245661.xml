	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect temazepam sleep daytime dyspnea , gas exchange sleep quality patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The study hypothesis temazepam produce adverse respiratory effect sleep patient COPD . In contrast , may result beneficiary effect positively affect sleep quality sleep structure may result alertness less daytime sleepiness less dyspnea day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Temazepam Patients With Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : More 50 % patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) sleep complaint characterise longer latency fall asleep , frequent arousal awakening , generalise insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness . Sleep disturbance seem severe advance disease substantially reduce patient ' quality life . The sleep complaint due dyspnea , chronic cough , sputum production , hypoxaemia hypercapnia night . One available therapy patient prescription hypnotic ( like benzodiazepine ) . However , think patient COPD sleep medication may produce adverse respiratory effect due suppression cerebral respiratory drive . In practice , never encounter adverse respiratory effect hypnotic patient COPD . There several trial COPD patient study potentially adverse effect . The result study inconsistent , relative old hypnotic use several methodological limitation . Furthermore , none study transcutaneous PCO2 PO2 monitor . Temazepam nowadays sedative first choice medical treatment sleep complaint . Aim : primary : studying effect temazepam respiratory function daytime night patient severe COPD . Secondary : studying effect temazepam sleep quality sleep structure objective subjective sleepiness daytime night patient COPD . Study design : double blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over randomise clinical trial . Treatment : 10 mg temazepam placebo seven consecutive night . Endpoints : Primary : difference PtcCO2 , PtcO2 oxygen saturation sleep 1 week temazepam compare placebo . Secondary : Respiratory Disturbance Index , Desaturation Index Hypercapnic Ventilatory Response , percentage REM/nREM-sleep total effective sleep time , Multiple Sleep Latency Test Epworth Sleeping Score .</detailed_description>
