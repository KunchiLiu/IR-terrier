	<brief_title>AZD2171 Treating Patients With Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate AZD 2171 patient recurrent small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall survival time progression . II . To assess toxicity associate administration AZD 2171 patient recurrent SCLC . III . To perform molecular correlative study archival tumor peripheral blood . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily 28 day . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
