	<brief_title>The Diabetes Telemonitoring ( DiaTel ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study design , implement , evaluate two medical care initiative different level intensity veteran diabetes suboptimal glycemic control . The higher-intensity initiative ( `` Active Care Management '' ) use home-based technology enable home messaging reminder compliance recommend guideline treatment , well self-monitoring blood glucose , blood pressure , weight . Data transmit health care provider . This initiative feature active care management , include change medication and/or diet implement study 's certify registered nurse practitioner supervision study physician collaboration subject 's primary care provider ( PCP ) . The lower-intensity initiative ( `` Care Coordination '' ) consist care coordination form monthly monitoring subject via telephone study 's research nurse refer subject his/her PCP need additional care . Both initiative represent supplementation current usual care practice treatment diabetes VA . The objective Phase Two study determine appropriate level subsequent management require sustain glycemic , blood pressure ( BP ) , lipid control among subject randomize Phase One care coordination ( CC ) active care management ( ACM ) . CC involve monthly telephone call diabetes nurse ( RN ) , whereas ACM involve home message monitor Viterion TeleHealth System plus active management glycemia , BP , lipids nurse practitioner ( NP ) . ACM subject transmit blood glucose , BP , weight measurement daily review intervention , necessary , NP . Subjects complete Phase One consent participate Phase Two randomize subsequent management low intensity follow additional six month . Phase One ACM subject randomize Phase Two either care coordination monthly telephone call ( i.e. , ACM-to-CC ) , care coordination monthly telephone call plus home telehealth monitor active management NP ( ACM-to-CCHT ) . CCHT subject continue transmit home blood glucose , BP , weight daily project office , abnormal value refer primary care provider ( PCP ) action . Phase One CC subject randomize either continue care coordination monthly telephone call ( CC-to-CC ) , referral back PCP usual care ( CC-to-UC ) . Randomization within group Phase Two stratify accord HbA1c ( &lt; 7 % &gt; 7 % ) conclusion subject 's six-month participation Phase One . The primary aim Phase Two ass whether glycemic , blood pressure , lipid control end additional six month follow-up differs patient randomize four group specify ( i.e. , ACM-to-CC , ACM-to-CCHT , CC-to-CC , CC-to-UC ) , adjust correspond HbA1c level end Phase One .</detailed_description>
