	<brief_summary>The overall objective research project examine clinical efficacy low extremity cycle functional electrical stimulation improve health fitness child spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . To achieve goal , control , randomize study conduct thirty child sustain spinal cord injury . The child study assign one three group : receive functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) leg cycle exercise , receive passive leg cycling , non-cycling control group receive electrical stimulation therapy generate muscle contraction low extremity . All three group balance amount time receive specific therapy . All therapy , initial assessment , conduct home order foster change lifestyle may prove essential improve quality life . The specific aim proposal delineate : Aim 1 : To assess , mean randomize control study design , ability FES cycling improve cardiovascular musculoskeletal system ten child spinal cord injury , compare ten child undergo passive leg cycling exercise ten child receive electrical stimulation therapy alone . Aim 2 : To determine , mean randomize control study design , feasibility use FES leg cycling exercise provide long-term health benefit improve neurologic status ten child spinal cord injury , compare ten child undergo passive leg cycling exercise ten child receive electrical stimulation therapy alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This control , randomize pretest/posttest study design three condition compare : FES leg cycling exercise , passive leg cycling exercise , control group receive electrical stimulation therapy . Randomization subject three group coordinate across two site . All variable control extent possible . All child study continue receive standard therapy level establish therapist work child . This include passive stretch low extremity use stand frame . Medications also remain unaltered throughout study , unless change body mass physical condition unrelated study ( i.e . growth ) warrant modification . All exercise session , initial one two-week assessment , conduct home . Electrical activation muscle study achieve use surface mount electrode . The muscle group electrically activate study quadriceps , hamstring , gluteal muscle bilaterally . This base upon previous FES cycling study conduct adult population . The appropriate stimulation level muscle determine subject . All subject three study group , addition participation study , receive standard therapy home . For child , include passive range motion stretch three time week . Ideally , stretch do cycle electrical stimulation therapy act `` warm-up '' period involve therapy perform . For child sustain tetraplegia participate study , standard therapy also involve stand three time week , either brace use stand frame . FES Cycling Group The FES cycling group ask participate additional therapy involve cycle thirty minute , three time week . All cycling movement accomplish electrical activation leg muscle . The first one two week conduct on-site monitor subject ' reaction exercise , therapy session continue home . The goal achieve thirty minute continuous cycle 50 rev•min-1 zero power output . Until subject reach point , cycle session divide five ten minute-long set , separate five-minute rest break . Each subject , however , complete total thirty minute cycle set speed . Once subject reach point , power output requirement increase . From zero point , power requirement first session increase one watt ( W ) . If subject cycle continuously 30 minute , next session power output requirement increase one watt . If subject pedal full 30 minute , power requirement maintain high level 30 minute continuous cycle achieve . The power requirement increase one watt next session . Increases continue manner end protocol , maximum power output 50 watt , reach . Passive Cycling Group The passive cycling group ask participate additional therapy also involve cycle thirty minute , three time week . However , motor bicycle provide cycle movement . The first one two week conduct on-site observation investigator , time therapy session continue home . The initial session use determine whether subject tolerate exercise , build fatigue resistance . The goal achieve thirty minute continuous cycle 50 rev•min-1 zero power output . Once subject cycle thirty minute continuously , subject continue level completion protocol . Electrical Stimulation Therapy Group Subjects control group maintain standard therapy , addition receive additional electrical stimulation therapy quadriceps hamstring muscle period 30 minute , three time per week . The child group act control group comparison additional therapy time involve cycling , compare additional therapy time . Electrical stimulation select additional therapy choice since specific health physiologic benefit already report group investigator could thus see comparable cycling . Stimulation muscle accomplish use portable , 2-channel surface stimulation unit ( Empi , St. Paul Minnesota ) instead ExoStim Unit . The hamstring quadriceps activate bilaterally 15 minute level produce strong muscle contraction . This accomplished subject rest supine position , work zero resistance . Attempts also make incorporate gluteal muscle electrical stimulation protocol , session exceed thirty-minute time period .</detailed_description>
