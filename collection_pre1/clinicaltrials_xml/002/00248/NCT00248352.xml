	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Standard Care Diabetes Case-Managed Care Diabetes Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diabetes high incidence coronary artery disease worsen cardiac prognosis . Death cardiovascular disease account 70 % diabetes-related death ( Booth , 2003 ) . Diabetes also common problem among hospitalized cardiac patient . In Ontario , 1995 1997 , nearly 1/3 104,471 patient admit acute myocardial infarction diabetes ( Booth , 2003 ) . In patient , hyperglycemia remain marker poor outcome despite improvement coronary care ( Wahab , 2002 ; Capes , 2000 ) . Several important question regard diabetes care cardiac patient admit hospital ward yet answer . First , know well glycemic control ward phase hospitalization improve short-term outcome . Second , assume short-term glycemic control beneficial , know intervention effective accomplishing . Third , assume put resource management education patient diabetes translate long term benefit , know whether do `` window opportunity '' provide cardiac admission whether intervention effective deferred discharge . These critical treatment dilemma prompt proposal GLUCOSE Pilot Study , randomize , control study examine effectiveness case-managed diabetes care use multidisciplinary team approach patient diabetes admitted manage concomitant ischemic heart disease . We design protocol study effectiveness case-managed diabetes care specialized endocrinology team compare usual care deliver attend cardiologist . Patients randomize specialized endocrinology care usual care time admission ward . The short-term outcome glycemic control cardiac patient diabetes admitted cardiology ward . In order compare typical model post-discharge care , patient re-randomized time discharge case-managed usual care group . The long-term ( primary ) outcome glycemic control risk factor reduction 6 month . This factorial design allow u compare several treatment model determine efficient effective way achieve best long-term diabetes control risk factor management patient .</detailed_description>
