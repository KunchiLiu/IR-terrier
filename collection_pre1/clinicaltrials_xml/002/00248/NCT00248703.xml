	<brief_title>Secondary Adjuvant Treatment Patients With Isolated Tumor Cells Bone Marrow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The presence disseminating ( isolate ) tumor cell ( DTC/ITC ) bone marrow ( BM ) completion adjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer associate poor prognosis . Methods detection DTC potential tool monitoring occult residual disease follow . Also , exist potent chemotherapy proven effective anthracycline-based chemotherapy fails ( f.ex . docetaxel ) . Consequently , study start test DTC detection surrogate marker clinical outcome localize breast cancer patient , select presence DTC BM standard adjuvant chemotherapy , receive secondary treatment docetaxel . In brief , patient receive anthracycline-containing chemotherapy localize breast cancer candidate . After informed consent radiologic sign distant metastasis , first BM aspiration perform end radiotherapy 8-12 week last chemotherapy cycle . The next BM aspiration perform 6 month later . At time point BMs analyze presence DTC . If DTC present 6 month BM test ( first BM sample exploratory research purpose ) , 6 cycle docetaxel administer ( 3qw ) , follow third forth BM analysis 1 month 13 month end chemotherapy . The patient receive docetaxel eradication DTC clinically compare persistence DTC docetaxel treatment .</detailed_description>
