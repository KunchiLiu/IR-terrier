	<brief_summary>The chemokine CXCL8 play key role recruitment activation polymorphonuclear neutrophils post-ischemia reperfusion injury solid organ transplantation . Reparixin novel , specific inhibitor CXCL8 . This study configure explore safety efficacy reparixin prevent delay graft function ( DGF ) kidney transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reparixin Prevention Delayed Graft Dysfunction After Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delayed graft function ( DGF ) common allograft complication immediate kidney post-transplant period , affect 25-35 % patient receive cadaver graft , rate 50 % report , especially recipient kidneys marginal donor . It important clinical complication require dialysis , prolongs hospitalisation , raise cost transplantation , make difficult management immunosuppressive therapy . Although effect DGF long-term graft function still debate , overall increase evidence DGF reduce long-term graft survival . Moreover , give well documented impact acute rejection long-term graft survival , conceivable DGF acute rejection synergize negatively influence long-term graft survival . Kidney reperfusion , long cold ischemia period , associate inflammatory reaction characterize massive polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) infiltration glomerular tubular level . The importance CXCL8 recruiting PMN kidney tissue ischemic time reperfusion clearly document . The efficacy reparixin prevent PMN infiltration tissue damage rat model kidney transplantation lung transplantation , well safety show human phase 1 study , provide rationale clinical study aim evaluate effect reparixin prevent DGF kidney transplantation</detailed_description>
