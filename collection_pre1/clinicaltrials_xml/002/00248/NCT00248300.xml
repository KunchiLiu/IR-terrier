	<brief_title>A Peri-intubation Oral Intervention Reduce Oral Flora VAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pneumonia lead cause death nosocomial infection . Intubation mechanical ventilation greatly increase risk ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) high trauma , burn , neurosurgical surgical patient . Oral bacteria show responsible development VAP since endotracheal tube provide pathway direct entry bacteria oropharynx respiratory tract . Therefore , reduce number microorganism mouth reduces pool organism available translocation colonization lung . The Tri-Service Oral Health Survey show military recruit inferior oral health compare civilian cohort . Further , oral hygiene likely deteriorate combat situation , increase oral microbial flora . Intubation combat casualty future likely performed field EMT-B train combat medic ( 91W ) adverse condition . Therefore , intervention reduce oral microbial flora intubation attractive reduce incidence VAP combat casualty . This study test effect single peri-intubation oral intervention oral microbial flora development VAP traumatic injury . Two hundred trauma patient require endotracheal intubation randomly assign either intervention control group 18-month data collection period . Data related oral microbial flora ( measure semi-quantitative oral culture ) VAP ( measure clinical pulmonary infection score-CPIS ) obtain study admission , 24 ( oral culture data ) , 48 72 hour intubation . The exact Wilcoxon two-sample one-sided test use test difference group . CPIS data compare use analysis covariance model . Covariates baseline oral culture category , trauma-injury severity score ( TRISS ) , illness severity ( APACHE III ) frequency time usual oral care also include . The finding study first report empirically base peri-intubation oral intervention reduce VAP easily apply care traumatic injury combat civilian casualty .</detailed_description>
