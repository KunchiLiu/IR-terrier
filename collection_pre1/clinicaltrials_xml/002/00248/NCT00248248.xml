	<brief_title>DOXIL Consolidation Therapy Ovarian Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While majority subject advance ovarian cancer respond well initial chemotherapy regimen taxol/platinum , responses generally limited duration . Even woman surgically define complete response initial chemotherapy &gt; 50 % recurrence rate Stage III disease . Once ovarian cancer recur rare cure possible , therefore , critical need define new therapeutic strategy treatment ovarian cancer . Consolidation chemotherapy one possible strategy . The strategy behind consolidation chemotherapy institute second-line chemotherapy immediately follow clinical response evidence recurrence . This strategy gain popularity many oncologist , secondary result GOG 178 , large study Southwest Oncology Group Gynecologic Oncology Group . GOG 178 set explore efficacy patient tolerability consolidation set . Moreover , objective GOG 178 study compare two different duration consolidation treatment use taxol consolidation clinically NED ovarian cancer subject follow primary chemotherapy carbo/taxol . The result GOG178 suggest long course ( 12 vs. 3 cycle paclitaxel ) give subject longer median progression-free survival ( 28 vs. 21 month ) . This trial close early due statistically improve PFS subject receive 12-month regimen paclitaxel versus 3 month regimen . Unfortunately , never definitively learn improve PFS translate improved survival ovarian cancer patient . A limitation regimen cumulative sometimes irreversible side effect neuropathy . Doxil select consolidation trial due document success second- line set ovarian cancer subject without long term negative sequela neuropathy The anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin broad spectrum antineoplastic action correspondingly widespread degree clinical use . In addition role treatment ovarian cancer , doxorubicin indicate treatment Hodgkin 's disease non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , hepatocellular gastric carcinoma , small cell cancer lung , soft tissue bone sarcoma , well cancer breast , bladder , thyroid . Unfortunately , toxicity limit therapeutic activity doxorubicin may preclude adequate dosing . The conventional formulation drug rapidly clear bloodstream large volume distribution , may contribute drug 's toxicity . High cumulative dos doxorubicin generally must avoid potential cardiotoxicity , individual dos often limited myelosuppression . Alopecia typically develop persists throughout treatment . Severe acute nausea vomiting , stomatitis , esophagitis additional adverse effect doxorubicin may necessitate dose-reduction discontinuation drug . A doxorubicin formulation improve tolerability might increase drug 's therapeutic ratio thus enhance efficacy . Liposomal encapsulation doxorubicin may reduce nonspecific drug delivery normal tissue well high peak plasma level free drug responsible toxicity . At time , liposomal formulation may deliver doxorubicin tumor improve specificity . Doxil doxorubicin formulation drug encapsulate liposome ( Stealthâ liposomes ) escape instant recognition uptake mononuclear phagocyte system . As result , formulation long circulation time , liposomes eventually become extravasate abnormally permeable vessel characteristic many tumor . Once concentrated tumor liposomes Doxil deliver high level doxorubicin malignant cell , without affect normal tissue.1 Doxil approve FDA use subject ovarian cancer whose disease progress recurred platinum-based chemotherapy subject HIV Kaposi 's Sarcoma . Doxil establish efficacy single agent recurrent ovarian cancer result three open-label , single-arm clinical study 176 subject metastatic ovarian cancer . Subjects study receive Doxil 50mg/m2 infuse one hour every 3 4 week 3-6 cycle longer absence dose-limiting toxicity progression disease . Doxil use several year 2nd line chemotherapy agent . In randomized Phase III study subject recurrent ovarian cancer Gordon et al , 18 % reduction risk death subject treat Doxil ( median survival 62.7weeks ) compare topotecan ( median survival 59.7 week ) . In platinum sensitive subject ( recur six month ) , reduction risk death even dramatic , 30 % reduction note subject receive Doxil ( median survival 107.9 week ) versus topotecan ( median survival 70.1 week ) . In trial Doxil 50mg/m2 administer every 28 day , result 23.4 % subject grade 3 4 hand foot syndrome ( HFS ) . 4 Management side effect include increase dosage interval and/or decrease dose 25 % . Today , Doxil 40mg/m2 every 28 day commonly use treatment recurrent ovarian cancer . Rose et al report result retrospective review note 40mg/m2 dose every 28 day minimize toxicity without sacrifice efficacy.6 Experience teach u toxicity minimize patient education focus alteration activity day precede 3-5 day follow drug administration . Other side effect bone marrow suppression , alopecia , nausea , vomit , fatigue minimal . There several small trial use weekly bi-weekly Doxil® cancer patient , include breast , gastric , pancreatic colon cancer , attempt reduce incidence hand foot syndrome encouraging result This study evaluate efficacy Doxil clinically NED ovarian cancer subject follow standard platinum/taxane base therapy . Applying every two-week dosing Doxil 20mg/m2 expect minimize problematic side effect , HFS .</detailed_description>
