	<brief_summary>The objective study determine effect airway surface liquid ( ASL ) volume mucociliary clearance cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . A two-isotope nuclear medicine technique utilized . This pilot trial include image n=7 CF subject n=7 healthy subject . The trial include one study visit per subject take approximately 3 hour . Hypothesis : The simultaneous image `` float '' `` penetrate '' radioisotope tag allow relative effect airway surface liquid volume mucociliary clearance determine evaluated CF normal subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Improper function mucociliary clearance system Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) lung major factor contribute chronic respiratory manifestation disease . Normally host defense mechanism remove inhale pathogen toxin inner surface lung . In CF , mutation CF gene result dysfunction Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) ion channel cell line airway epithelium , cause improper flux ion sodium , chloride , bicarbonate . The call `` low volume '' hypothesis CF pathogenesis contend liquid lining airway becomes thin viscous due abnormal absorption sodium airway , draws water airway , partially totally defeat mucociliary clearance . The rate mucociliary system clear material lung quantify use nuclear medicine test call mucociliary clearance scan . This study pilot new variation mucociliary clearance scan use `` float '' `` penetrate '' radioisotope tag . The difference clearance tag provide information airway surface liquid volume affect mucociliary clearance . This pilot trial include image n=5 CF subject n=5 healthy subject .</detailed_description>
