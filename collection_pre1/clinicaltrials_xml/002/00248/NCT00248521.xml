	<brief_title>17-Dimethylaminoethylamino-17-Demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-DMAG ) Treating Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors Tumors That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose , dose-limiting toxicity , recommend phase II dose 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-DMAG ) patient unresectable metastatic solid tumor . - Determine feasibility , safety , toxicity profile drug patient . Secondary - Determine clinical pharmacokinetic profile drug patient . - Determine tumor response patient treated drug . - Determine biologically effective dose . OUTLINE : This open-label , non-randomized , dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-DMAG ) IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos 17-DMAG maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . An additional 10 patient treated MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 25-35 patient accrue study within 12-18 month .</detailed_description>
