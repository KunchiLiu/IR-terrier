	<brief_summary>The study investigate viability two cognitive rehabilitation strategy improve functional outcome people schizophrenia . Many people schizophrenia experience impairment cognitive function limit ability . These impairment show precede onset illness represent vulnerability factor exacerbate emerge psychotic symptom . These impairment affect range functional domain include symptom severity , work function , symptom management , treatment , overall quality life . Recognizing link cognitive impairment function , clinicals researcher attempt remediate cognitive impairment provide cognitive retrain program similar use traumatic brain injured patient adaptive skill train . Cognitive retrain involves repetitive exercise increase elemental cognitive function include memory , attention , psychomotor speed , planning , cognitive flexibility . Adaptive skill train involve didactic group exercise social skill , activity daily live , symptom management . Each approach demonstrate rehabilitation benefit .

	<detailed_description>Objective : Many people schizophrenia experience impairment cognitive function limit ability . These impairment affect range functional domain include symptom severity , work function , symptom management , treatment , overall quality life . Recognizing link cognitive impairment function , clinicians researcher attempt remediate cognitive impairment provide cognitive retrain program similar use traumatic brain injured patient adaptive skill train . Cognitive retrain involves repetitive exercise increase elemental cognitive function include memory , attention , psychomotor speed , planning , cognitive flexibility . Adaptive skill train involve didactic group exercise social skill , activity daily live , symptom management . This study investigate effectiveness combination two approach outcomes schizophrenia . This three group randomize clinical trial investigate effect cognitive rehabilitation outcome range proximal ( train task performance neuropsychological test performance ) , distal outcome ( treatment group performance quality life rating ) . We believe cognitive augmentation significant impact train task neuro-psychological test performance attenuate , significant effect performance treatment group . Finally , hypothesize combination adaptive training cognitive rehabilitation measurable impact distal outcome daily live skill quality life . Method : One hundred ( 100 ) individual invite participate 30-week program . After informed consent obtain diagnosis establish , participant receive extensive assessment neuropsychological , psychological psychosocial functioning . Participants randomly assign one three condition use stratified procedure base cognitive test performance ( ensure similar number severely less severely impaired participant condition ) . The three condition : ( 1 ) usual care control group Life Skills Development Group ( LSDG ) , ( 2 ) Individualized computer base cognitive rehabilitation ( ICBCR ) augment LSDG ; ( 3 ) Cognitive Remediation Therapy ( CRT ) LSDG . Participants compare : ( 1 ) LSDG performance , ( 2 ) neuropsychological test performance ( 3 ) psychosocial functioning . Attendance group remediation session compensate rate $ 5 per session . The key question answer Cognitive Rehabilitation strategy effective improve cognitive function ? Does Cognitive Rehabilitation produce good performance Life Skills Development Group ( LSDG ) ? Does Life Skills Development Group augment Cognitive Rehabilitation produce good psychosocial outcome standard care control group ?</detailed_description>
