	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Likeability , Safety , Abuse Potential NRP 104 Adults With Histories Stimulant Abuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There need less abusable stimulant medication provide symptom control child ADHD compare conventional stimulant product . Currently , top line amphetamine product Adderall XR ( R ) treatment child ADHD involve once-a-day morning dose 30 mg per day per Adderall XR ( R ) Package Insert . Adderall XR ( R ) potential abuse hence classify schedule II product . As part development NRP104 treatment child ADHD , important evaluate abuse potential NRP104 comparison immediate release d-amphetamine . A previous exploratory dose range study ( NRP104.A01 ) NRP104 demonstrate dos NRP104 150 mg safe produce effect equal less 40 mg immediate release d-amphetamine . When compare d-amphetamine , diethylproion produce effect qualitatively similar d-amphetamine significantly less potent . Intravenous subcutaneous route diethylpropion le potent compare oral route ( Jasinski et al ; 1974 ) . This large study design compare abuse potential NRP104 Schedule II d-amphetamine sulfate Schedule IV diethylpropion hydrochloride . Data collect study use evaluate abuse potential NRP104 .</detailed_description>
