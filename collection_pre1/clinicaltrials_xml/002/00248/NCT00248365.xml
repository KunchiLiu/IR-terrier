	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess tolerability safety two intensity level Theralux extracorporeal photochemotherapy treatment subject steroid refractory intolerant GvHD . The current hypothesis apoptotic cell re-injected patient induce immunomodulation effect alleviate GvHD symptom . Using Theralux procedure , dose photodynamic treatment may modulate achieve maximal immunomodulatory effect treat patient . The intervention iterative extracorporeal photochemotherapy autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) rhodamine-derivative TH9402 ( drug ) Theralux ( device ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) remain major cause morbidity mortality relate allogeneic stem cell transplantation . While improvement immuno-suppressive regimen reduce frequency severity acute GvHD , incidence chronic GvHD ( cGvHD ) remain unchanged range 30 % sibling match related donor transplant 70 % unrelated donor bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplant . Factors associate cGvHD include increase donor recipient age , prior acute GvHD , use alloimmune female donor . Conventional therapeutic approach cGvHD , include corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent , demonstrate limited efficacy patient extensive disease associate high toxicity . Iterative extracorporeal photopheresis demonstrate clinical immunomodulatory activity subject acute chronic GvHD . The currently available process ECP control cell number , exposure time , specific cell population target due nature procedure . Using Theralux procedure , define population cell may target , intensity photoactivating agent exposure modulate achieve maximal immunomodulatory effect treat subject . This study attempt explore effect Theralux procedure two defined condition . Response toxicity determine intensity level dose associate clinical response immunomodulatory effect DC NK cell population define optimal intensity level subsequent large trial .</detailed_description>
