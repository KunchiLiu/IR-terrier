	<brief_title>Resistance Exercise Training Shoulder Neck Following Surgery Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conduct randomize controlled trial evaluate effect progressive resistance exercise training ( PRET ) shoulder neck dysfunction due spinal accessory neurapraxia/ neurectomy patient head neck cancer . Sixty-four head neck cancer survivor randomly assign PRET standard care . Participants assign PRET group exercise 3 time per week 12 week . The goal exercise program enhance scapular stability , improve mobility strength upper extremity . The resistance exercise program progressive term number set repetition perform , well amount lift , depend baseline strength level overall performance status . The primary outcome study include pain dysfunction , active passive range motion measure , strength endurance testing , quality life . Nerve conduction test electromyography perform assess/ monitor status spinal accessory nerve trapezius muscle function respectively .</detailed_description>
