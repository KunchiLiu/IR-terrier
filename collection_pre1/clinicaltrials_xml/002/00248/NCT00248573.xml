	<brief_summary>This observational , natural history trial mechanism gut adaptation adult short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) . Patients SBS ( &lt; 200 cm small bowel ± colon ) study initially 2-9 month last small bowel resection exactly 6 month initial study . GCRC-studies examine intestinal nutrient absorption , gut barrier function gut mucosal biopsy specimens marker nutrient transport cell proliferation apoptosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) condition occur massive surgical removal section small bowel require treat condition Crohn 's disease , lack adequate blood flow intestine , trauma , twist bowel disorder . Patients SBS develop severe diarrhea , weight loss , loss nutrient stool , malnutrition , dehydration deficiency specific nutrient . SBS thus major cause intestinal failure adult child . SBS high rate death medical complication patient experience enormous health care-related cost decrease quality life . Patients SBS often require intravenous feed [ know parenteral nutrition ( PN ) ] due chronic malabsorption malnutrition also commonly develop infection intestinal bacteria , suggest abnormality intestinal `` barrier '' bacteria present intestine . In animal model SBS , increase growth intestinal lining ( mucosa ) improve nutrient absorption occur time ( intestinal adaptation ) . Although SBS patient commonly exhibit decreased diet-induced diarrhea within first 2 year intestinal surgery , little known intestinal mucosa adapts patient SBS . The propose pilot study first comprehensive study serial change gut mucosal structure function early period ( 2-30 month ) SBS human . Our Specific Aims design determine : 1 ) whether residual small bowel colonic mucosa SBS patient exhibit adaptive growth , concomitantly improve nutrient absorption gut barrier function ; 2 ) The underlie mechanism early gut adaptation human SBS , evaluate change mucosal cell growth production key molecule responsible nutrient transport/absorption gut barrier function ; 3 ) The utility plasma citrulline concentration serum flagellin antibody titer marker human intestinal absorptive capacity gut barrier function , respectively . Our research provide important new information natural history underlying cause early intestinal adaptation man . This information valuable design future therapeutic study patient SBS hold promise improve rehabilitation individual .</detailed_description>
