	<brief_title>Response Individuals With Class II Malocclusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Class II Division 1 prevalent malocclusion . Many method utilized correct . The purpose prospective study clarify specific cephalometric indicator biological responsiveness lead successful Class II Div.1 treatment grow individual . These indicator hopefully assist differential diagnosis `` true '' `` pseudo '' Class II , mask Class I , presume relatively easy treat stable treatment result . 70 -100 subject Class II/I malocclusion recruit treated exact mode treatment . As Class II consider one least half molar cusp Class II . Patients already erupt low first premolar include presume approximate time maximum growth spurt want exploit use functional appliance . Crowding arch exceed 4 mm exclude denoalveolar change due alignment . Any tooth agenesis , besides third molar , exclude subject study . The medical history patient non-contributory regard hormonal abnormality , arthritis pain TMJ . Syndromic patient exhibit craniofacial abnormality exclude . The skeletal age patient assess observe cervical column . Every patient record take , latter include lateral ceph panoramic x-ray . Standard intra- extra oral picture take well ( T0 ) . The treatment protocol include first phase 3-4 month slow palatal expansion utilize removable palatal plate 0.25 mm jackscrew middle ( T1 ) . The screw turn week two week twice week upper posterior teeth over-expanded 2 mm per side . During phase II ( T2 ) patient ask wear appliance adjust incorporate tongue crib force mandible Class I relationship acthing way know functional appliance work ( eg activator ) . The crib incorporate 4 loop canine area place impinge lower lingual gingival region long enough patient able shift mandible back . If initial overjet exceed 5 mm mandibular advancement gradual . Further adjustment make maintain Class I relationship . The patient wear appliance 8-12 month ( T3 ) . New record take time . If brace need , patient continue fix appliance .</detailed_description>
