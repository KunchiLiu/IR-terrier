	<brief_summary>Arthritis major cause disability . Of nearly 70 million person US arthritis and/or chronic joint symptom , nearly 8 million disabled arthritis . Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) two common disable form . Despite evidence physical activity improve functional health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) outcomes low health care cost , proportion US population engage recommend amount physical activity low even low among arthritis . Moreover , considerable variation clinician ' promotion physical activity arthritis client . Care provider infrequently ask client physical activity behavior report feeling unprepared promote physical activity . This application study effect behavioral intervention aim promote physical activity , include lifestyle physical activity , arthritis-specific generic HRQOL outcome . The proposed physical activity management program ( PAM ) base chronic care model ally health professional promote patient self-management activity outside traditional physician office encounter . The program individualize counsel referral intervention , conducted physical activity manager , direct theory-based comprehensive assessment individual patient barrier strengths related physical activity performance . The specific aim randomize , control trial 480 client RA knee OA follow 24 month test effectiveness physical activity management combine physician physical activity promotion ( PAM group ) compare physician physical activity promotion ( control group ) improve arthritis-specific generic HRQOL , observe measure function , objectively measure self-reported physical activity level . In addition , exploratory analysis do assess whether improvement HRQOL physical activity performance associate PAM program mediate increase physical activity level theory-based motivational variable , respectively . This study intend generate feasible method health care provider health care system increase physical activity level client arthritis result widely applicable strategy health behavior change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Design Overview This five-year study randomize control trial 480 client arthritis conduct three site Northwestern University Feinberg School Medicine campus , Rehabilitation Institute Chicago Arthritis Center ( RIC-AC ) , Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation Rheumatology Division Ambulatory Center ( NMFF-Rheum ) , NMFF General Internal Medicine Ambulatory Center ( NMFF-GIM ) . After 6 month startup period , two hundred forty client RA ( 120 RIC-AC 120 NMFF-Rheum ) 240 client knee OA ( 120 RIC-AC , 60 NMFF-Rheum , 60 NMFF-GIM ) recruit 24 month period , subject follow 24 month . Randomization stratify diagnosis , site , disease-specific physical functional status . Half client randomize PAM intervention half control intervention . Independent variable include demographic characteristic , arthritis severity comorbid condition , IMCHB model variable : motivation ( self-regulation efficacy ) , cognitive appraisal ( perceived competency ) , affective response ( mental health ) . Outcomes measure blinded interviewers/assessors include self-reported objective measure physical activity , self-reported measure disease specific generic health-related quality life , observed measure physical function . All independent variable outcomes measure baseline nearly independent variable outcomes measure 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month follow-up . The primary analysis test effectiveness PAM compare control group improve disease-specific health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) . Secondary analysis test 1 ) effectiveness PAM compare control group improve generic HRQOL , 2 ) effectiveness PAM compare control group improve observed measure function cardiovascular fitness , 3 ) effectiveness PAM compare control group increase physical activity performance , 4 ) whether PAM 's effectiveness improve HRQOL mediate 's ability increase physical activity 5 ) whether PAM 's effectiveness improve physical activity performance mediate change theory-based motivation variable . Description justification study population Given 100 different form arthritis ( define chronic condition affect joint surround tissue ) , choose client two well-defined pathophysiologically distinct disease study , knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Knee OA prototype chronic degenerative arthropathy high prevalence associate great amount disability . RA prototype common chronic inflammatory arthropathy , associate high rate disability . We expect PAM program effective improve physical activity health status level two distinctly different group arthritis client , effective many , , arthritis client . Case definition . Classification criterion develop American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) use client knee OA RA . The criterion utilize knee x-ray used increase specificity knee OA criterion . These standard case definition use routinely rheumatology literature show high sensitivity specificity.108 , 109 Selection criterion . Clients fulfil ACR criterion knee OA RA eligible trial meet follow criterion : 1 ) age 18 old , 2 ) able ambulate least household distance ( 50ft ) , 3 ) able speak understand English , 4 ) plan total joint replacement follow 12 month , 5 ) contraindication physical activity due comorbid condition , 6 ) plan relocate away Chicago land area least 24 month . Methods recruit , enrol , sustain participation . The Rehabilitation Institute Chicago Arthritis Center ( RIC-AC ) Rheumatology General Internal Medicine Divisions Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation ( NMFF-Rheum NMFF-GIM ) , practice fulltime Northwestern University Feinberg School Medicine faculty member , sit client recruit trial . While campus , RIC NMFF physically separate one another separate administrative structure . Both adequate number eligible client enroll study . Based administrative data , 500 individual client RA 700 individual client knee OA see RIC-AC past twelve month . This average 40 RA nearly 60 knee OA client month , number likely grow practice experience approximate 15 % growth client per year . More triple number RA client see NMFF-Rheum practice annually . Com-parable number knee OA client see RIC-AC NMFF-Rheum . To assure ready access knee OA subject , NMFF-GIM also site subject . Over 700 unique client explicit ICD-9 CM visit code knee osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis identify NMFF-Rheum EPICcare electronic medical record month May-July 2004 ; approximately 200 additional client osteoarthritis 25 rheumatoid arthritis see NMFF-GIM period . Several hundred client RA knee OA currently enrol IRB-approved research registry facilitate recruitment study . Enrollment sustain participation propose study enhance proven willingness client academic practice participate ongoing observational study . Dr. Leena Sharma follow cohort 300 subject knee osteoarthritis past 5 year . Drs . Pamela Semanik George Liang ( NMFF rheumatology colleague ) able recruit 185 311 RA client respectively study within one year . Based similar experience , expect attrition lose follow-up rate less 10 % per one year le 20 % two year . Practice newsletter presence familiar friendly research assistant enhance sustain interest ongoing research initiative sit . Study interview conduct convenience subject , either face face telephone use computerized telephone interview software . Institutional Review Board approval already obtain collect medical record health status data RA client NMFF-Rheum site physical activity health status data knee OA RA client RIC-AC . Description consent process . Eligible client inform study participate physician RIC-AC NMFF-Rheum NMFF-GIM practice mail time schedule clinic visit . 1 . Mailings study announcement participant list IRB-approved RA knee OA client registry RIC-AC , NMFF-Rheum , NMFF-GIM . At inception study , participate physician request retrospective ICD-9 cod visit data RIC-AC , NMFF-Rheum , NMFF-GIM client cod RA adult knee OA ( diagnosis cod 714.0 715.96 , exclude client v code aftercare previous joint replacement ) see 3 site previous 12 month ( Month 1 ) . These visit data contain client name , address phone number . By end project month 2 , client identify registry relevant prior visit code mail study solicitation letter , cover letter sign attend clinic physician , consent form stamp return envelope sign consent refusal participate . This mail provide study investigator phone number participant obtain information . For willing participate , study coordinator able screen eligibility , include information prior immanently schedule knee replacement surgery , well date client ' next regularly schedule clinic appointment ( know ) . Consent material describe need six no-cost study visit transportation meal reimbursement policy . Within two week initial mailing , study personnel initiate telephone contact IRB-approved registry client respond mail explain study determine interest study participation . If interested , second mailing make client need . Medical record registry client return sign informed consent review determine eligibility . Subsequent clinic schedule examine consent , eligible client patient report MD appointment time continuous basis determine client 's next upcoming schedule physician visit . Consented client contact phone within six week regularly schedule clinic visit . Based date forthcoming physician appointment , client schedule baseline study visit ( maximum flexibility arrange weekday weekend study visit patient 's convenience ) approximately three week `` index '' baseline physician appointment . This entire process repeat , study month 8 16 , assist meeting enrollment target 2 . In-Person Enrollment . Clients reachable phone mail , prefer enrolled person , registry identify physician potential subject time initial clinic visit , directly approach participation study coordinator time clinic visit . Written information physician give eligible client read wait room upon arrival clinic short video study available view visit . During clinical visit physician discus opportunity client participate study physical activity health status factor associate good poor health status answer question arise . If client agree participate , research assistant explain study detail , obtain write informed consent , schedule person telephone interview collect study data . If client consent , deem eligible subsequent medical record review , date next regularly schedule follow-up physician visit use determine time initial baseline study assessment visit . Non-eligible client thank time interest , add registry future study notification , desire . The Pre-Randomization ( Baseline ) Study Assessment Visit ( See Figure 2 ) At baseline study assessment visit , study coordinator fit participate client Actigraph accelerometer , provide instruction package mail return , perform observe physical function test battery , schedule first telephone interview one week later ( two week prior index clinic visit ) client ' convenience . This enable telephone interview data ( include HRQOL physical activity data ) refer week Actigraph data record . Clients also advise prospective date five subsequent study assessment visit , first two three month interval , final three six month interval , entirely unrelated subsequent MD visit . Randomization Index Physician Visit ( See Figure 2 ) Randomization stratify diagnosis ( RA vs. knee OA ) , site ( RIC-AC vs. NMFF-Rheum subject RA , RA-AC vs. NMFF-Rheum vs. NMFF-GIM subject knee OA ) , level disease- specific physical function ( specified cutpoints HAQ Disability Scale RA subject WOMAC-Physical Function Scale knee OA subject ; cutpoints set median value RA knee OA subject participate previous clinical study RA knee OA RIC NMFF ) . Consecutive client within stratum randomly assign either PAM control intervention . Randomization occur allow study personnel notify participant group assignment well index physician visit subject receive MD physical activity counseling ( full description ) . If select PAM group , client request allow additional time exist physician appointment initial , cost , expense-reimbursed visit physical activity manager . The description PAM program . If spending additional time index physician visit conclude inconvenient client , separate PAM study visit experimental group client schedule soon possible thereafter . Other potential interaction physician referral experimental group activity , PAM study assessment visit remain completely independent study client ' medical care , proceed usual customary manner . This analogous chronic disease management setting . Physician physical activity promotion give study subject The physician physical activity promotion intervention , give index physician visit ( Figure 2 ) design accomplish less 5 minute , include ) determine whether client meeting CDC physical activity recommendation , b ) encourage client work toward maintain level physical activity , 3 ) elicit discuss client 's question and/or concern physical activity . There two reason give intervention group . First , standard practice , , practice participate trial second , postulate PAM successful MD 's support goal . The Physical Activity Management ( PAM ) Program ( See also Appendix ) The physical activity management program draw principles Cox 's model describe earlier . Because potential positive patient health outcome increase provider intervention/interaction well fit uniqueness patient ( background , cognitive , affective , motivational manifestation ) , Physical Activity Management program conduct use standard intervention protocol guide result ACTA assessment . The ACTA interview self-score form provide opportunity client reflect upon his/her physical activity identify support barrier participation . The client work physical activity manager identify select goal s/he personally find motivate . Together , client physical activity manager negotiate strategy need help client achieve self-identified goal . This may involve physical activity manager : - provide information physical activity , community resource available client - making referral necessary care provider - help client identify day-to-day activity way client incorporate activity life - allow client ultimate decisional control . The intervention revise follow patient feedback clinician experience pilot program . The physical activity management program consist 6 component , part base work Cimprich110 : verbal explanation purpose physical activity management program ; identification barrier support physical activity physical activity goal use ACTA ; guidance develop action plan , select way active plan client difficulty increase activity ; establish agreement write increase physical activity week ; strategy re-cording progress ; verbal explanation plan future meeting physical activity manager . The IMCHB recognize role choice self-determination health behavior , ability clinician 's interaction style intervention approach support discourage health behavior , dynamic impact patient 's singularity profile health outcomes 111 . To optimize feature , client negotiate physical activity manager contract outline goal , commitment increase activity , thing go wrong , use pedometer , three monthly calendar record daily step include list activity client try increase physical activity , copy activity pyramid lifestyle physical activity suggestion . The client see contacted physical activity management base-line , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month time ACTA repeat . The client 's physician ( ) receive physical activity management summary report time . The client physical activity manager negotiate contact may indicate client 's need . 112 , 113 An autonomy-supportive provider health care environment key intervention strategy assist initiate maintain behavior change . A detailed description protocol find Appendix . Self-determination theory distinguishes autonomous control behavior regulation . Autonomous behavior initiate sustained extent people experience true sense volition choice , act personal importance behavior . Controlled behavior perform individual feel pressure , either external intrapsychic force 114.The autonomy supportive physical activity manager encourage client maintain decisional control process , choose activity feel likely succeed also assist development plan client difficulty increase maintain physical activity . By continue maintain contact client 2 year period , revise plan goal achievement necessary , intervention recognizes need begin primarily volitional activity i.e. , consciously choose implemented activity integrate habitual routine client everyday life . This autonomy-supportive intervention also inform chronic disease management model Wagner colleague utilize protocol , place clinical responsibility ally health professional , emphasize patient education increase access clinical community expertise , give physician great availability clinical information relevant client 's physical activity . Follow-up Study Assessment Visits ( Figure 2 ) All study client schedule five subsequent study visit 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month baseline assessment , Actigraph fitting , observe physical function test , subsequent telephone interview follow-up within week provide experimental control subject .
