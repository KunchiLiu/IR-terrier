	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine blood pressure blood flow control head-up tilt semi-upright position . In investigation study blood pressure blood flow brain , without medication lower blood pressure ( Vasotec ) . We determine person spinal cord injury able maintain blood flow brain ( get dizzy ) assume upright position blood pressure decrease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Blood Pressure Blood Supply Brain Persons With Spinal Cord Injury .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals tetraplegia lack normal sympathetic nervous system regulation blood pressure , therefore , relative hypotension common occurrence . This hypotension may pronounce postural stress . Loss mental acuity sometimes even consciousness associate symptom postural hypotension individual tetraplegia . There evidence suggest although mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) relatively low individual , middle cerebral arterial blood flow ( CBF ) may maintain . Consequently , individual chronic tetraplegia often compensate stable seat upright position . Autoregulation CBF define stability cerebral blood flow throughout range systemic blood pressure ( MAP ) . This proposal examine systemic hemodynamics middle cerebral artery blood flow HUT without Vasotec , angiotensin II inhibitor . By partially completely ablate renin-angiotensin system , postulate play major role blood pressure regulation , potential dissociation systemic blood pressure middle cerebral artery blood flow , individual tetraplegia , may demonstrate . The aim determine whether person chronic tetraplegia able maintain similar CBF , similar CBF change , able-bodied control despite great decrease MAP hypotensive challenge . The relationship MAP CBF define population . Understanding relationship may lead improved screening treatment prevention postural hypotension person tetraplegia .</detailed_description>
