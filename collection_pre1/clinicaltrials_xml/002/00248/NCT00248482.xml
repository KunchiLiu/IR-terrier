	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Giving imatinib mesylate irinotecan cisplatin may keep tumor come back . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give imatinib mesylate irinotecan cisplatin work treat patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate After Irinotecan Cisplatin Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine 4-month progression-free survival rate patient c-kit positive , extensive stage small cell lung cancer treat maintenance therapy comprise imatinib mesylate induction therapy comprise irinotecan cisplatin . Secondary - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine tolerability imatinib mesylate maintenance therapy patient . - Determine response rate patient treat irinotecan cisplatin . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 8 cisplatin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve response ( partial complete ) stable disease proceed maintenance therapy . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient may continue receive therapy 1 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
