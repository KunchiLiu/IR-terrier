	<brief_title>The Genetic Basis Atrial Fibrillation ( AF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , heart rhythm disorder , major health problem . As many 3 million US person afflict ; number expect rise significantly come decade AF incidence directly correlate age . AF significantly associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Our goal research : 1 . Establish clinical database DNA bank 1000 individual AF 1000 individual without AF . 2 . Directly test hypothesis know functional polymorphism cod sequence promoter region cardiac gene ( ion channel gene know affect survival set leave ventricular dysfunction ) predispose individual AF . Over past decade , advance technique technology gene characterization yield significant clue molecular mechanism certain human heart rhythm disorder . The role ion channel polymorphism subject AF unknown . Similarly , also know whether polymorphisms gene impact risk AF . The ability characterize genomic `` at-risk '' profile would many potential benefit patient care . Paramount among : 1 . Increased oversight intervention at-risk subject , might prevent unnecessary morbidity mortality due AF . 2 . Further insight pathogenesis AF , may lead preventative curative therapy . Subjects recruit patient pool Cardiovascular Institute ( include Comprehensive Heart Center PUH Outpatient Cardiology Clinic ) . For subject enrol , record demographic information ; etiology detail heart disease ; family history heart disease ; non-cardiac medical history ; physical exam finding ; medicinal therapy ; result prior cardiac testing ( echocardiograms [ Echo ] , gate blood pool scan heart function [ MUGAs ] , exercise stress test [ ESTs ] cardiac catheterization , clinical electrophysiology study [ EP Studies ] . Records maintain identifier lock file cabinet office Principal Investigator . A blood sample ~10 ml draw participate subject day enrollment . Blood sample draw subject . There follow require subject . Blood send University Pittsburgh School Medicine Cardiovascular Research Center nucleate cell isolated whole blood centrifugation . DNA isolate nucleated cell store Cardiovascular Research Center ( 17th floor Biomedical Science Tower ) . All DNA sample cod ensure confidentiality , maintain locked freezer duration study ( 5 year ) . Samples destroy request subject . Samples ( blood DNA ) control Principal Investigator . The DNA sample use identify polymorphisms ion channel gene , well gene may associate increase risk AF . Genotyping polymorphism perform genomic DNA . The genomic DNA amplify polymerase chain reaction method use gene-specific primer . For polymorphism , genotype identify . We determine frequency genotype study population , attempt define significant association AF .</detailed_description>
