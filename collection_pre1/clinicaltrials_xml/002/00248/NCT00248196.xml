	<brief_summary>Coronary heart disease single lead cause death United States . In 2000 , implicate 681,000 death ( 1 every 5 death ) . Myocardial infarction ( MI ) major cause death patient die coronary heart disease , estimate incidence 1.1 million new recurrent case per year . It well establish reperfusion successful treatment salvage myocardium acute infarction . However , despite treatment , substantial number patient still remain risk develop large infarct , reduce left ventricular function increase mortality . Therefore , adjunctive therapy design reduce ischemic metabolism cellular injury pending successful reperfusion , protect myocytes undesired effect reperfusion ( `` reperfusion injury '' ) , beneficial limit infarct size . Mild hypothermia one potential therapy . This study design evaluate whether adjunctive use mild hypothermia reduces extent heart damage cause heart attack .</brief_summary>
