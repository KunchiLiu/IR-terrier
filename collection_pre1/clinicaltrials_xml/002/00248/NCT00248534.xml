	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide methylprednisolone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Rituximab may help chemotherapy kill cancer cell make cancer cell sensitive drug . Giving rituximab together temozolomide methylprednisolone may effective treatment primary CNS non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give rituximab together temozolomide methylprednisolone work treat patient recurrent primary CNS non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate patient recurrent primary CNS non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat rituximab , temozolomide , methylprednisolone . Secondary - Determine overall 6-month progression-free survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Induction therapy : Patients receive rituximab IV 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 oral temozolomide daily day 1-7 15-21 . After day 28 , patient stable disease well proceed consolidation therapy . Consolidation therapy : Patients receive oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course . Patients achieve complete remission proceed maintenance therapy . Maintenance therapy : Patients receive methylprednisolone IV 2 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study within approximately 13.3 month .</detailed_description>
