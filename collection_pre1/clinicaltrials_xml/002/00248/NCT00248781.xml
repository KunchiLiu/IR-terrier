	<brief_title>Home-based Exercise Via Telecommunications System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inactivity sedentary lifestyle show accelerate exaggerate age-related decline muscle strength . In context , rapid decline strength among old adult link physical frailty , fall , functional decline , impaired mobility , nursing home placement . Substantial evidence suggest habitual physical activity associate maintenance muscle strength physical function well 8th 9th decade life . We propose investigate effect home-based resistance exercise program , administer via interactive telecommunication system without participation health professional , functionally limited old veteran . Subjects randomize either automated exercise group attention placebo control group . The exercise group undergo resistance training home three time week 6 month , guide telecommunication system , follow 6-month maintenance phase less frequent interaction system . Outcome measurement include muscle strength physical performance relate daily activity 3 , 6 , 12 month determine efficacy intervention time course durability effect . The control group also interact telecommunication system week whole year , exercise prescribed . If home-based , automate , interactive exercise program effective , provide low-cost easily disseminate approach improve strength functional status old veteran</detailed_description>
