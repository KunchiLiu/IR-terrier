	<brief_summary>The long-term objective study determine whether positive affect self-affirmation condition add empirically demonstrate approach motivate behavior change effective standard approach reduce risk factor behavior among high-risk group patient coronary artery disease . Thus , goal project refine improve strategy long-term maintenance physical activity among patient post-angioplasty stent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial : Changing Behavior Post-Angioplasty Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among coronary artery disease patient either angioplasty stent , objective randomize trial evaluate whether novel behavioral intervention employ induced positive affect self-affirmation effective intervention without positive affect increase maintenance newly initiate physical activity post-procedure . Secondary objective : - To determine whether patient receive positive affect self-affirmation intervention initiate multiple behavior change ( e.g. , change health behavior direct risk-factor profile ) control group one year . - To determine whether positive affect self-affirmation intervention increase physical activity among patient depressive symptom . - To determine whether patient successful increase physical activity successful change health behavior .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient undergo coronary artery catheterization find least single vessel stenosis revascularization angioplasty coronary artery stenting eligible enrollment . Patients must able provide inform consent within one week procedure . Patients unable walk several block regardless reason exclude trial ( e.g. , arthritis , stroke , claudication ) . Enrollment trial design modify postprocedure behavior . Patients refuse participate exclude . If time prior enrollment study , patient 's cardiologist determines patient participate study , patient enrol trial .</criteria>
