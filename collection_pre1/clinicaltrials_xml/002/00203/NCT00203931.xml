	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Cetuximab With Pemetrexed/Cetuximab Therapy Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While EGFR inhibitor demonstrate activity NSCLC [ integration first-line therapy combination standard agent yield disappointing result ] . There many potential reason disappointing result first-line study [ A single-arm Phase I trial cetuximab combination docetaxel suggest good efficacy second-line therapy NSCLC docetaxel alone come expense increased toxicity ] . Preliminary data indicate cetuximab single agent activity set . The confidence interval activity overlap median time progression current second-line cytotoxic therapy option compare Hanna study [ A clinically relevant question is- concurrent cetuximab pemetrexed significantly improve upon outcome cetuximab monotherapy follow pemetrexed monotherapy ? ] . Many patient receive EGFR inhibitor develop acneiform rash severity rash associate good outcome treatment . Several study demonstrate correlation intensity percentage tumor cell stain EFUR expression response therapy . However , Phase II study , University Colorado , cetuximab add standard first-line treatment NSCLC reveal 6/10 responder develop rash within 2 week initiate treatment ( Personal Communication , Dugan , et al . BMS ) . Therefore , early development rash may clinically useful marker subsequent response novel approach identification biological marker phenotype prior initiation therapy may helpful subsequent determination patient likely benefit EGFR inhibitor therapy . To address issue propose phase I randomize study concurrent pemetrexed/cetuximab compare sequential cetuximab/pemetrexed therapy second-line treatment advance NSCLC . Patients randomize study entry . Regarding prospective analysis rapid-rash forming phenotype , patient receive 2 week initial treatment cetuximab undergo formal rash evaluation , serum skin collection . According initial randomization , half study subject continue cetuximab monotherapy remainder receive concurrent cetuximab pemetrexed . The primary study endpoint freedom progression secondary endpoint objective response rate base comparison patient ( concurrent therapy group patient treat cetuximab monotherapy Day-14 ( first receipt cetuximab ) reference treatment start date . Overall survival analyze secondary endpoint ass efficacy concomitant treatment cetuximab pemetrexed compare sequential treatment cetuximab follow pemetrexed upon disease progression . As patient treatment arm receive cetuximab , correlative study perform enrolled patient . For serum proteomic study design identify serum polypeptide signature associate response cetuximab-based therapy , serum sample shall collect enrollment , prior receive third dose cetuximab therapy . To provide opportunity perform retrospective pharmacogenomic study , whole blood DNA collect patient enrollment subsequently analyze candidate gene polymorphisms outcome data available . Finally , alternative approach identification marker responsiveness EGFR inhibition already progress University Chicago entail collection skin biopsy treatment EGFR inhibitor . As ongoing collaboration University Chicago Section Dermatology , patient propose study undergo skin biopsy enrollment 2 week cetuximab therapy . The investigator extract mRNA fresh frozen skin specimen perform microarray study test utility mRNA expression pattern associate rash responsiveness EOFR inhibitor currently ongoing investigation University Chicago . Therefore expect study : 1 ) identify significant improvement concurrent cetuximab/pemetrexed therapy second-line treatment NSCLC sequential monotherapy , 2 ) timely minimally invasive collection serum expose skin , provide opportunity test previously identify biomarkers individual responsiveness cetuximab therapy , 3 ) confirm prospectively whether early development rash cetuximab treatment predict responsiveness either concurrent sequential therapy .</detailed_description>
