	<brief_summary>Asthmatics inflammation large airway ( tubes air travel lung ) . The large airway locate central lung . New research show asthmatic also inflammation small airway . The small airway locate peripheral lung ( part lung away central lung ) . Until , inhale medication available make big particle never reach peripheral lung . The purpose study try measure level inflammation peripheral lung asthmatic see inflammation decrease different type inhale corticosteroid . The investigator check airway inflammation use inhale corticosteroid large particle size reach large airway ( Flunisolide-CFC ) , use inhale , small particle corticosteroid reach large small airway ( Flunisolide-HFA ) . Subjects make 6 study visit two phase study . In first phase , investigator collect baseline information subject use placebo ( inactive substance ) . In second phase , subject take either large small particle corticosteroid . Visits involve questionnaires various test measure lung function ( spirometry , force oscillation , methacholine challenge ) . Exhaled nitric oxide measure indication inflammation . Subjects also measure make note lung function home twice daily use peak expiratory flow meter . Two visit involve fiberoptic bronchoscopy investigator may collect cell tissue sample without surgery . Another two visit involve use high resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) scan indirectly evaluate disease distant part lung .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged 18 50 year . Younger subject exclude due great concern respect risk radiation bronchoscopy child ; old subject due great risk bronchoscopy . Mild moderate persistent asthma ( forced expiratory volume 1 second [ FEV1 ] great equal 70 % predict { Hankinson , 1999 # 266 } ; PC20 le equal 8 mg/ml ) currently use short act inhaled beta agonist need control asthma symptom . The use follow medication exclude subject enter study : Oral parenteral steroid within 6 month Inhaled corticosteroid within 3 month Antileukotrienes , badrenergic block agent , inhale cromolyn sodium nedocromil , macrolide antibiotic , investigational drug within 1 month Drugs exposures , opinion investigator , could influence study result Tobacco within 1 year less equal 5 pack year . Pregnant woman , lactate woman , woman childbearing age willing take precaution avoid become pregnant study . Subjects upper respiratory infection receive influenza vaccine within 6 week study . Subjects history allergy adverse reaction inhale beta agonist methacholine . Subjects clinically significant evidence cardiovascular , central nervous system , endocrine , gastrointestinal , hematopoietic , hepatic , psychiatric , respiratory ( asthma ) disease Eligibility determine investigator use inclusion/exclusion criterion . No subject exclude base race gender . Subjects must 18 50 order avoid great risk bronchoscopy , 18 , exposure radiation . To avoid risk , woman enrol pregnant , lactate childbearing potential unwilling undertake appropriate precaution .</criteria>
