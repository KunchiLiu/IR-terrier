	<brief_summary>Based limited amount experience plasmapheresis CytoGam concomitant use , researcher seek evaluate pharmacokinetics ( drug absorption , distribution , elimination ) therapy . The researcher also interested evaluate pharmacokinetics various immunosuppressant medication patient receive tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil daclizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Amount Medications That May Removed From Body During Plasmapheresis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation emerge desired treatment choice patient end stage renal disease . Although transplantation become increasingly successful , continue risk associate . Prior perform kidney transplant patient cross-matched ( test determine whether preformed antibody donor ) . Preformed antibody result previous pregnancy , blood platelet transfusion prior transplant . Performing transplant patient preformed antibody donor generally result hyperacute rejection ( immune system attack new kidney ) . This hyperacute rejection usually result kidney loss high percentage patient . Due consequence , pre-transplant cross-matching emerge standard care . Although hyperacute kidney loss avoid , large population highly sensitized patient little hope receive transplant identify . A number group study method lower specific antibody level variety clinical setting . The two primary method use today transplantation plasmapheresis ( separation plasma cell , removal solute , immune globulin , medication ) administration immune globulin therapy . Employing either technique individually jointly substantially reduce acute rejection improve kidney survival highly sensitized patient . The immune globulin treatment study include large variation dosage well difference immune globulin product . The result small study identify one therapy , product dosage could consider standard care . The kidney transplant work-up also consist match ABO blood group donor recipient . Transplantation recipient blood group result poor outcome due antibody mediate rejection ( immune system attack kidney ) . However , due shortage organ available transplantation , increase number patient await transplant favorable outcome live donor transplant , transplant program develop protocol transplant recipient ABO blood group . These protocol center around plasmapheresis treatment immune globulin . As positive cross-match patient state earlier , standard care yet identify . Dr. Lloyd Ratner , currently Columbia University former Chief Transplant Thomas Jefferson University Hospital former colleague Johns Hopkins University study use plasmapheresis combination Cytomegalovirus Immune Globulin Intravenous ( CytoGam ) reverse positive cross match transplant organs ABO incompatible blood group . This enable 20 kidney transplant perform patient graft survival one year similar traditional cross match negative ABO compatible patient . These result generally consider outstanding give fact antibody mediate rejection historically 75 100 % incidence graft loss . The treatment protocol use consist plasmapheresis treatment alternate CytoGam infusion every day 3 9 treatment prior transplantation another 1-5 treatment transplant . Plasmapheresis increasingly perform treat various infectious , immunological , metabolic inherit disease . In procedure , plasma cellular component blood separate solute plasma , include drug may remove . Generally , volume 1 1.5 time plasma volume remove replaced equivalent volume crystalloid colloid . The procedure remove solute drug blood compartment tissue store remain unaffected except re-equilibration decrease plasma concentration . After plasmapheresis treatment patient receive infusion CytoGam use `` inactivate '' remain antibody . However , know extent subsequent treatment plasmapheresis remove CytoGam patient receive hour day prior . During treatment phase plasmapheresis patient also receive number medication immunosuppressant prevention treatment graft rejection , antibiotic prevention treatment infection various medication related illness . The effect plasmapheresis may removal medication know many agent . This information would helpful potential need re-dose give supplemental dos medication . This extremely important immunosuppressant medication since under-dosing agent may result serious negative outcome . Due many unknown aspect would useful know extent drug removal plasmapheresis treatment . This would enable precise dose ultimately well patient care .</detailed_description>
