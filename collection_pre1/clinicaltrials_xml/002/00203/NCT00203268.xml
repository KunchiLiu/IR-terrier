	<brief_summary>This research study examine migraine medicine dihydroergotamine mesylate ( DHE-45 ) .It use treat two migraine attack subject history skin sensitivity associate headaches.This skin sensitivity call cutaneous allodynia ( pronounced q-tay-nee-us al-o-din-ee-uh ) .Cutaneous allodynia sensation pain non-noxious stimulus apply normal skin . It note several study subject migraine , seventy nine percent subject experience allodynia facial skin side headache . It also show allodynia develop , migraine medicine would normally effective migraine pain , become much less effective ineffective . This study compare difference , , attack treat early study drug treat later study drug . It hop trial provide information use DHE-45 subject cutaneous allodynia . Understanding allodynia may help u understand pain system work migraine .</brief_summary>
