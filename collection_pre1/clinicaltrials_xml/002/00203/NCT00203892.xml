	<brief_title>Study CAP1-6D Patients With Locally Advanced Surgically Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PC dismal prognosis . Despite surgery , chemotherapy , radiation , patient PC die distant metastatic disease . Peptide vaccine approach offer attractive potential treatment option . Since CEA express &gt; 90 % PC , would make attractive target vaccination approach . Several different vaccination approach test use CEA TAA . Although investigator suggest DC-based approach active , limited need obtain patient-specific DCs . One attractive approach would add GM-CSF peptide recruit endogenous DC site vaccination . There data use tumor vaccine advance PC . Gjerertsen et al . use K Ras peptide GM-CSF 48 patient advanced PC . 50 % patient show peptide specific CTL response ( Gjertsen , Buanes et al . 2001 ) . Those immune response increase overall survival , The data phase I II clinical trial base heavily pretreated patient metastatic disease . The majority clinical response disease stabilization . The data B cell lymphoma vaccine suggest immune response likely generate minimum disease state ( Bendandi , Gocke et al . 1999 ) . For patient complete resection treatment adjuvant chemoradiation , patient locally advance nonresectable disease treat standard chemoradiation , presently therapy available decrease chance disease reoccurrence . Our hypothesis immunization modify CEA peptide Montanide/GM-CSF lead expansion CEA-reactive CTL result control CEA express pancreatic carcinoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must express HLAA2 Patients must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma pancreas express CEA either IHC serology . Patients prior chemotherapy must complete least 28 day prior start treatment Patients must completely resected disease unresectable locally advanced disease . Patients resected disease pancreaticoduodenectomy negative margin . Patients locally advanced disease metastatic disease Patients must complete 5FU base chemoradiation &gt; 4 week , 12 week prior study registration . Age &gt; 18 year . ECOG performance status 01 Life expectancy great 3 month Patients must normal organ marrow function Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy , biologic therapy , radiotherapy , experimental ( investigational ) agent within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior start treatment recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive previous CEA vaccine . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition CEA , Montanide ISA51 , GMCSF . Patients must know autoimmune disorder ( SLE , Rheumatoid Arthritis ) , condition immunosuppression ( HIV ) , treatment immunosuppressive drug ( include oral steroid , continuous use topical steroid , steroid inhaler ) . Replacement dos steroids patient adrenal insufficiency allow . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , active GI bleeding , inflammatory bowel disease psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude study peptide vaccine and/or GMCSF unknown effect fetus . Breastfeeding discontinue mother gong treated clinical trial . Because risk patient immune deficiency treat peptide vaccine unknown , HIVpositive patient exclude study . Appropriate study undertake patient intrinsic immunosuppression indicate . Patients currently active second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix register . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy evidence recurrence least 5 year</criteria>
