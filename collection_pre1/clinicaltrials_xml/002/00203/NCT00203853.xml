	<brief_title>Evaluation Intervention Adherence Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) HIV Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>-- Background -- The management HIV change dramatically since introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . HAART consist drug regimen target virus various point life cycle thus effective monotherapy . The drug comprise regimen usually belong different class antiretrovirals . HAART regimens complex difficult tolerate . They usually consist multiple pill take two three time day may also need take food , empty stomach plenty fluid ( depend particular drug ) . In addition , multiple side effect may limit patient 's willingness take . Adherance HAART paramount importance . Paterson et al show patient take 95 % prescribed dos order achieve high likelihood success maintain undetectable viral load . Poor adherence lead serious consequence include failure prevent viral replication , shorten survival development viral resistance . Various method use measure adherence HAART . All method limitation gold standard exists compare . The easy method employ questionnaire , interview write documentation ( ie diary ) . These supplement pill identification test . This test ask patient examine board display two similar pill antiretroviral drug identify take . Correct score test show correlate adherence . The accuracy self report adherence depend patient 's ability recall accurately report behavior . Since patient may difficulty recall adherence long period time , one commonly use measure rely self-report past 4 day . All method self-report overestimate level adherence compare treatment adherence measure . Patients ' wish please health care provider may partially responsible . Patients admit non-adherent self-report also poor adherence measure . The ability healthcare professional predict adherence HAART poor . In one study , physicians nurse wrong 41 % time ask patient &gt; 80 % adherent HAART . Other method monitor adherence pill count , pharmacy record , electronic monitoring device , Medication Events Monitoring System ( MEMS ) serum drug level . All method particular shortcoming . Pill count time consume . Patients may remove pill bottle without take ( `` pill dump '' ) , mix pill forget medication come clinic . Pill count , announce unannounced may also view intrusive many patient . Pharmacy-based measure assume patient use pharmacy payer source refill medication . Thus prescription refill time indicate non-adherence . Limitations include patient may get free medication sample physician even prescription fill time , mean patient take drug . Electronic device expensive use context research . MEMS cap device register every time bottle cap remove . Patients may remove one dose time , open cap take medication engage `` pill dump '' . Serum drug level use recently research setting . It expensive reflect level drug recent dose medication . A study conduct currently University Chicago Hospitals use Q methodology study factor influence adherence HAART . Preliminary result study show patient subdivide five category base upon response question regard experience HAART , health system live life HIV . Attempting predict individual patient 's potential adherence HAART extremely difficult . Studies show conflict result hard interpret . Factors consistently show associated poor adherence low level education , depression , active drug/alcohol use young age . Health care professional try improve adherence HAART since inception . The new antiretrovirals simpler take , long half-lives combine two three medicine one pill . A study Stone et al show poor adherence associate medication need take empty stomach take three time day . Campo colleague find high number antiretroviral medication regimen , less likely patient would adherent . Interventions improve adherence difficult evaluate . This due complex nature measurement adherence , intervention , effect intervention adherence . Pill box , chart medication photograph , electronic reminder , pharmacy support study . It show intervention useful short term effect durable . Thus reinforcement intervention necessary . -- Materials Methods -- We plan study adherance HAART improve electronic reminder device ( watch alarm ) , pill box phone call make health care professional . About 200 HIV infect adult ask participate study . For inclusion study , patient must least 18 year age old able give consent . They must HAART six week . Also patient include study must provide research staff work telephone number , contact . Patients randomized intervention control group . All patient HIV viral load note begin study . This incur additional cost patient HIV viral load measure standard care patient HAART regular interval . This measurement reflect efficacy HAART HIV viral load high may reflect poor adherance . All patient administer questionnaire enrollment . This questionnaire consist three part . The first part address demographic patient . The second pill identification test . The patient ask recognize agent take part HAART regimen chart photographs antiretroviral medication . The third part Q sort questionnaire patient ask rank statement regard experience HAART , healthcare system , live life HIV etc . This format currently use ongoing study University Chicago Hospitals study subjective attitude adherance HAART HIV infect adult . That study enrol ~90 subject . Data ongoing study use part new study . All participant ask provide research staff work telephone number . Lack work telephone number exclusion criterion . After questionnaire , patient randomize intervention control group . The intervention group give wristwatch alarm . The patient group receive instruction program watch reminds take medication . They give pillbox . The pillbox able hold one week 's supply HAART . Also intervention group receive standardize phone call physician directly relate health care month three month . The phone call last 15 minute comprise standard set question medication . The response patient note . The control group observe study period . At end study , HIV viral load group note attempt make see intervention effect adherance HAART . If difference adherance intervention control group end study , think intervention simple cost effective . It easily reproduce center take care patient HIV .</detailed_description>
