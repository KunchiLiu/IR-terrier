	<brief_title>Assessment Study Steroid Effect Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis Subjects Treated With Glatiramer Acetate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One interim analysis plan possible early termination due proven efficacy 75 % preplanned 500 ( approx . 375 patient ) recruit patient complete entire study duration early discontinue . In addition stopping rule already give proven efficacy , sponsor also interested examine data futility ( i.e. , absence desire treatment effect ) view terminate trial `` insufficient '' effect treatment see . The reason need futility arose : 1 . Recruitment difficulty 2 . Increasing dropout rate 3 . Budgetary constraint The primary efficacy measure define percent change baseline termination ( Month 36 Early Termination ) normalize brain volume ( Brain Atrophy ) measure accord SIENA ( Structural Imaging Evaluation use Normalization Atrophy ) method . However , since many patient complete entire study time futility analysis , sponsor 's decision futility analysis perform patient MRI scan month 24 36 early termination visit - late available . Based recalculation study power ( probability unconditioned interim result provide real power study design anew ) , conditional power ( base interim result ) risk assessment false negative , Data Monitoring Committee agree study terminate early .</detailed_description>
