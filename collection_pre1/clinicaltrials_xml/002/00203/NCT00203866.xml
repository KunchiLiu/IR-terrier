	<brief_title>Trial G250 Peptide IL-2 Following Surgical Resection Locally Advanced/Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal cell carcinoma chemotherapy radiotherapy resistant neoplasm poor prognosis . Immunotherapy biologic agent IL-2 consistently produce response rate 10-15 % . Currently , patient locally advanced disease patient solitary metastasis , treatment modality curative potential surgical resection . There presently approve agent use adjuvant therapy surgical resection decrease risk recurrence . Peptide-based vaccine approach offer attractive treatment option . The high prevalence G250 RCC , definition HLA-A2-restricted epitope ( common HLA type ) , immunogenicity make attractive candidate peptide-based vaccine approach RCC therapy . The promising preclinical clinical evidence provide rationale use IL-2 potentiate antitumor effect cancer vaccine . There presently conclusive data best dose IL-2 use adjuvant cancer vaccine . One paradoxical find preclinical clinical trial despite enhancement antitumor effect cancer vaccine , number antigen-specific CTL increase IL-2 give cancer vaccine 35 ] . In contrast , patient treat peptide vaccine ( without IL-2 ) melanoma trial evidence high level antigen-specific CTL , tumor regression observe 36 ] . Some possible explanation include capillary leak high dose IL-2 result CTL leave circulation possibility high dose IL-2 decrease efficient T-cell priming . A recent explanation propose advance mechanism 1-cell activation . As level activation increase , T-cells become susceptible apoptosis . This phenomenon know activation-induced cell death ( AICD ) IL-2 may role amplification downregulation immune response . High dose IL-2 may help augment increase activation CTL , may lead increase susceptibility AJCD . The evidence animal model low dos IL-2 sufficient increase potency DC-based immunization provide rational study . In current study , low dose IL-2 ( 1 x 106 IU ) similar dos use Yee et al . adoptive I cell therapy . This dose show expand maintain CTLs preclinical clinical model . The high dose ( 11 x 106 IU ) choose base expected toxicity higher dose IL-2 experience dose single agent RCC . Our hypothesis immunization G250/Montanide/GM-CSF plus IL-2 lead expansion G250-specific CTL result kill 0250 express micrometastatic RCC . We propose dose finding study escalate low dos IL 2 ( subcutaneous ) , since prior study specifically evaluate use low dose IL-2 cytokine adjuvant attempt establish correlation dose immunolgic response .</detailed_description>
