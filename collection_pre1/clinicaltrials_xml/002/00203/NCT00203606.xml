	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C infect many 300,000 Canadians . Up 25 % infect develop cirrhosis risk liver failure liver cancer . Cirrhosis cause hepatitis C common reason liver transplantation Canada . The large group infect people use injectable street drug . However , people continue use drug routinely exclude scientific study test new treatment Hepatitis C generally recommend receive available treatment . Although several reason give justify exclude people treatment , little scientific evidence available support . We plan examine successful treatment current standard treatment pegylated interferon ribavirin continue use injection drug . We compare result treatment 70 active drug user result publish clinical trial ( change initial plan compare treatment result 70 local ) reform drug user ) . Our goal determine whether reasonable success rate achieve active drug user would justify routine treatment .</brief_summary>
