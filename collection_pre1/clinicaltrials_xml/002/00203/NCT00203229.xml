	<brief_summary>This research study look safety ( e.g. , occurrence side effect ) efficacy ( well drug work reduce trigeminal neuralgia attack ) drug call lamotrigine adult trigeminal neuralgia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Research Study Test Safety Effectiveness Investigational Drug Patients With Trigeminal Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , add-on study lamotrigine trigeminal neuralgia . Thirty-eight eligible patient trigeminal neuralgia enrol ; nineteen randomize active medication group nineteen placebo group . Using daily diary , patient document overall pain level attack frequency intensity four week . After four week baseline period , patient initiate medication ( lamotrigine placebo ) . Patients titrate either reach maximum dose 400mg per day 700mg patient enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( EIAED 's ) , side effect inhibit increase ( know maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ) , trigeminal neuralgia pain resolve ( refer pain free dose ( PFD ) ) eight week . Patients remain constant dose prior medication throughout study . Patients remain maximum dose , MTD , PFD maintenance period least eight week , end maintenance period patient opt stay medication unblinded medication dosage . Primary outcome average intensity daily pain .</detailed_description>

Subjects require `` rescue '' analgesic medication study allow use increase dos current ( prestudy ) opioid and/or non opioid analgesic clinically indicate ( e.g. , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication , acetaminophen , COX2 inhibitor , topical analgesic ) . Subjects allow use new analgesic limited time nonneuropathic pain ( e.g. , headache , sinusitis , strain muscle , minor ache pain ) , prohibit initiate therapy new analgesic agent use continuously throughout remainder study . If subject currently receive tricyclic antidepressant , anticonvulsant , and/or Class I antiarrhythmic ( e.g. , amitriptyline , mexiletine , phenytoin , gabapentin carbamazepine ) treatment pain condition , subject must willing able abstain initiation agent within 4 week prior randomization throughout study . Subject must willing able abstain initiate alternative therapy ( e.g. , acupuncture , massage physical therapy ) pain relief study .
