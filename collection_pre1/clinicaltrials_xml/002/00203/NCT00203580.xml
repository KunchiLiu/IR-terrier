	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess long-term treatment patient proximal venous thrombosis administration subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin ( tinzaparin sodium ) versus standard care use intravenous heparin follow oral warfarin sodium .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Effect Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin ( LMWH ) Versus Warfarin Mortality Long-Term Treatment Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) ( Main LITE Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The accepted treatment acute deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) initial continuous intravenous heparin follow long-term oral anticoagulant therapy . Improvements method clinical trial use accurate objective test detect venous thromboembolism make possible perform series randomize trial evaluate various treatment venous thromboembolism . The specific objective Main LITE Study : - determine low-molecular-weight heparin , give subcutaneously daily without laboratory monitoring , effective adjusted oral warfarin sodium reduction mortality rate . - determine low-molecular-weight heparin therapy cost-effective present standard care method . - determine incidence Factor V Leiden Prothrombin 20210A mutant genetic abnormality .</detailed_description>
