	<brief_summary>Pulmonary fibrosis essentially scarring lung . Some type ( DIP , NSIP ) often respond therapy . Others like UIP ( usual interstitial pneumonitis ) rarely respond . UIP frequently progress poor prognosis survival three five year . In UIP , often cause determine therefore call Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) . A prevalence rate 27–29 cases/100,000 report may even high 250 cases/100,000 individual 75 year age . Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) chronic fatal pulmonary disorder . Conventional treatment immunosuppressive therapy disappointing , median survival &lt; 40 % five year diagnosis . Moreover , therapy may lead premature death result immunosuppression susceptibility infectious disease . Another problem relate IPF , incomplete picture natural history pathogenesis disorder . Clearly , new strategy therapy necessary . Published evidence suggest less 20 % patient IPF respond corticosteroid ( prednisone ) . In patient fail steroid , immunosuppressant drug azathioprine cyclophosphamide use . An international consensus statement recommend steroid azathioprine cyclophosphamide onset treatment . Unfortunately large number trial show little effect drug progression disease . There currently FDA approve drug treatment IPF . Laboratory finding establish human specimen Interstitial Lung Diseases include IPF demonstrate impalance expression protein ( Th2 Cytokines , CC Chemokines , CXC Chemokines ) . When protein level excess low , alter normal lung mechanism , cause angiogenesis ( abnormal blood vessel formation ) , inflammation , scar tissue formation impair immunity patient . We hope establish efficacy anti-angiogenetic agent add therapy IPF patient , prove bring stabilization improvement . Minocycline show inhibit angiogenesis ( new abnormal blood vessel formation ) thus affect fibrotic process ( prevent scar tissue formation ) . Laboratory animal study support potential therapeutic role Minocycline IPF . Minocycline semi synthetic derivative tetracycline . It first market antibiotic 1972 . Clinical trial minocycline mainly perform sexually transmissible disease acne . Minocycline also use treat several disease nocardiasis , mycobacteriosis , leprosy , lyme disease , pyoderma gangrenosum , autoimmune bullous dermatitis , carteaud disease , prurigo . The usual side effect minocycline : lightheadedness , dizziness , vertigo pigmentation . We investigate genetic , molecular , cellular , whole animal model , human specimens patient fibrotic lung disease test prediction : The pathogenesis pulmonary fibrosis ( lung scar ) due “ multiple hit ” cause inbalance certain mediator ( protein ) responsible abnormal blood vessel formation , scar tissue formation ( without inflammation inside lung ) impair immunity patient . Each 3 project proposal direct link project clinical core . The SCOR clinical core identify enroll patient Interstitial Lung disease ( ILD ) , include IPF . The clinical core collect clinical data , well obtain fluid lung washing human lung tissue specimen . Each project use human specimen indicate specific aim correlate finding response therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Clinical symptom consistent idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) &gt; 3 month duration ( insidious onset otherwise unexplained dyspnea exertion bibasilar inspiratory crackle ) 2 . Age 20 79 , inclusive . Patients ages 2034 must diagnosis either open videoassisted thoracoscopic ( VATS ) lung biopsy eligible . 3 . Diagnosis must make highresolution ( HRCT ) chest CT show definite probable IPF AND within 30 month prior screen either follow ) : Open VATS lung biopsy show definite probable usual interstitial pneumonia ( UIP ) , require subject ages 2034 due rarity IPF age group OR Nondiagnostic transbronchial biopsy exclude condition ( include granulomatous disease , sarcoidosis , hypersensitivity pneumonitis ) AND abnormal pulmonary function test ( reduce FVC decrease DLCO impair gas exchange rest exercise ) AND 2 following : 1 . Age &gt; 50 year 2 . Insidious onset otherwise unexplained dyspnea exertion 3 . Bibasilar , inspiratory crackle ( dry Velcro type character ) 4 . Currently low dose ( &lt; 0.3 mg/kg LBW ) prednisone plus azathioprine cyclophosphamide per ATS Consensus least 28 day prior study treatment intend continue therapy end study treatment . This therapy may precede course higherdose prednisone discretion treat physician . 5 . FVC &gt; 40 % &lt; 90 % predict ( Hankinson/NHANES2 ) value screen . 6 . DLCO &gt; 20 % predict ( Neas/NHANES3 ) value screen . 7 . PaO2 &gt; 50 mmHg rest 20 minute room air baseline . 8 . Able understand sign write informed consent form comply requirement study . Exclusion criteria Patients follow exclude study : 1 . History clinically significant environmental exposure know cause pulmonary fibrosis ( drug , asbestos , beryllium , radiation , domestic bird , etc ) . 2 . Known explanation interstitial lung disease , IPF , include limited radiation , sarcoidosis , hypersensitivity pneumonitis , bronchiolitis obliterans organize pneumonia ( BOOP ) , cancer . 3 . Diagnosis connective tissue disease ( scleroderma , SLE , rheumatoid arthritis , etc . ) accord American College Rheumatology criterion . Antinuclear antibody ( UCLA test # 0737 , $ 39 ) ≥1:160 , rheumatoid factor ( UCLA test # 0881 , $ 29 ) &gt; 25 , Scl70 positive ( UCLA test # 1977 , $ 12 ) , anticentromere antibody positive ( UCLA test # 16232 , $ 15 ) baseline . These lab test consider minimum standard care . Additional criterion , evaluate ( preferred standard care ) ENA ( SM &amp; RNP ) ( UCLA test number 16393 , $ 36 ) positive double strand DNA ( UCLA test number 0797 , $ 67 ) positive . 4 . Any condition IPF , opinion investigator , likely result death patient within next year . 5 . Evidence active infection include bronchitis , sinusitis , UTI , cellulitis within 1 week prior treatment . 6 . History unstable deteriorate cardiac neurologic disease , include limited : 1 . Myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass surgery angioplasty within past 6 month 2 . Congestive heart failure require hospitalization within past 6 month 3 . Uncontrolled arrhythmia 4 . Stroke TIAs within 18 month 7 . Pregnant lactating female . Females child bear potential require negative serum urine pregnancy test prior enrollment agree practice abstinence prevent pregnancy medically acceptable method birth control ( e.g . barrier method , IUD , Norplant , Provera injection oral birth control pill ) . 8 . Liver function specific limit . Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 X ULN , transaminases ( AST , SGOT ) ( ALT , SGPT ) &gt; 3 ULN , alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3 ULN . 9 . Hematology outside specify limit , WBC &lt; 2,500/mm3 , hematocrit &lt; 30 &gt; 59 , platelet &lt; 100,000/mm3 screening . 10 .
