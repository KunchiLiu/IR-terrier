	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate time progression eligible patient cancer oral cavity , pharynx , larynx , paranasal sinus , cervical esophagus treat concomitant chemoradiotherapy regimen bevacizumab/5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) /hydroxyurea/radiation therapy ( B-FHX ) comparison 5-fluorouracil hydroxyurea ( FHX ) alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Chemoradiotherapy Intermediate Stage/Selected Stage IV Cancers Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , intend explore feasibility effect add bevacizumab Fl-TX patient intermediate stage head neck cancer select patient stage IV disease . As mentioned previously , although single modality therapy ( surgery radiotherapy alone ) often use treat patient Stage II head neck malignancy , substantial success , still sizeable group patient ( approximately 30 % 40 % ) fail treatment , represent locoregional recurrence much difficult treat . Furthermore , common use radical surgery many instance lead loss organ function . Based knowledge , feel justifiable include stage II patient ( T2NO ) combine chemoradiation study . Our extensive experience use chemoradiotherapy patient regionally advance non-metastatic Stage 4 cancer head neck area suggest select patient low nodal status ( Nondisease ) include T4 primary ( i.e . T4 NO MO T4 Nl MO ) low risk distant failure patient present high nodal status ( N2 N3 disease ) . Aggressive combined locoregional therapy one administer study , opinion appropriate group patient address major concern locoregional failure . The primary goal study exploration pharmacodynamic effect bevacizumab ( 10 mg/kg ) appropriate marker angiogenesis tumor tissue comparison non-bevacizumab contain chemoradiation regimen ( FHX alone ) . These result correlate number clinical endpoint include rapidity clinical response , locoregional control rate , time progression , need salvage surgery , overall survival measure QOL organ function . The predictive prognostic value specific molecular marker patient HNC also evaluate . In order shorten total duration treatment without affect total administer dose , modify traditional radiation schedule FHX include two treatment daily fraction oppose one . This modification allow completion treatment 4 5 cycle oppose traditional 6 7 cycle . Given modification radiation schedule , consider prudent include control arm ( modified FHX ) addition B-FHX , within randomize design . The control arm also help interpretation result obtain measurement correlative marker angiogenesis .</detailed_description>
