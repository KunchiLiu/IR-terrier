	<brief_summary>The purpose research gain insight way physician adopt new practice technique . In particular , interested medical innovation diffuse throughout social network . We wish examine diffusion Low Molecular Weight Heparin ( LMWH ) use Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) throughout social network general internal medicine intern , resident , attending University Chicago Hospital . In numerous clinical trial , LMWH demonstrate effective unfractionated heparin bridge long-term anticoagulation therapy Coumadin , add benefit early discharge hospital easy dosing , need monitoring , home therapy . A DVT critical pathway establish U C 1998 , LMWH use off-label purpose begin 1997 . However , unclear quickly use LMWH adopt physician general medicine service , whether exists pattern adoption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diffusion Use Low Molecular Weight Heparin Thrombosis Medicine Services</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design study retrospective nature . We interest primarily use LMWH patient admit general medicine service January 1 , 1997 February 1 , 2001 primary secondary diagnosis relate Venous Thromboembolism , include specific ICD-9 code . Using data abstraction form , gather follow information : 1 ) patient demographic , 2 ) identity attend , resident , intern care patient , 3 ) whether patient absolute relative contraindication receive LMWH , delineate DVT critical pathway , include insurance status 4 ) patient treat his/her condition . To examine whether identity primary care physician affect whether LMWH give , also collect name primary care physician list chart .</detailed_description>
