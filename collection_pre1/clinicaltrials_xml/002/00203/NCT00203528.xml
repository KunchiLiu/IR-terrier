	<brief_title>Divalproex ER vs. Risperidone Bipolar Disorder With Comorbid Substance Use Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients screen seven day time follow assessment complete : Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) , general medical history , psychiatric history , physical examination , physician assessment , laboratory test . Patients mood stabilizer oral neuroleptic prior study enrollment respond fully medication taper medication washout period 48 hour . After completion screening , patient determine eligible study randomize study medication ( divalproex risperidone ) 1:1 double-blind fashion . Scheduled study visit occur every two week total 12 week . Assessments visit , baseline visit week 12 visit follow : Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) , Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) , Alcohol Drug Use Inventory , clinician alcohol drug use scale , self report scale , adverse event , vital sign weight , concomitant medication , urine drug screen , study medication accountability . Designated research staff complete assessment weekly . Investigators blind laboratory test complete week 2 , 4 , 12 visit . Patients randomized Depakote ER begin 500mg BID day randomization remain dose 5 day , day 6 increase 20mg/kg achieve valproic acid level 80-100 ( blind laboratory reporting ) . Patients randomize risperidone , initially start 2mg QD increase 4mg day 5 increase ( tolerate require ) 6mg/d .</detailed_description>

Patients Axis I Axis II diagnosis investigator â€™ opinion , would interfere compliance confound interpretation result . Patients CNS neoplasm , uncontrolled metabolic , endocrine , demyelinate progressive neurological disorder , pancreatitis , urea cycle disorder . Patients blood chemistry ALT and/or AST value ( ) great equal three time upper limit normal prior randomization . Patients history chronic acute medical disorder , opinion investigator , would confound interpretation study result . Patients medical condition require continuous use medication would interfere evaluation safety efficacy divalproex ER risperidone . Patients receive betablockers exclude unless dose stable great 6 month . Patients receive depot neuroleptic medication within one interinjection interval randomization . Patients depot medication may include randomize early time next schedule depot injection . Patients exhibit sign drug alcohol withdrawal time randomization .
