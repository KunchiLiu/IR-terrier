	<brief_summary>Subjects schedule undergo Greater Occipital Nerve Block ( GONB ) treatment chronic daily headache ( CDH ) . GONB use many year treatment headache . The nerve block do inject liquid drug skin back head area great occipital nerve . The nerve run superficially area , therefore drug inject skin . The injected drug block electrical transmission nerve , result reduce head pain . There treatment option patient receive GONB , however , clinician use local anesthetic ( lidocaine /or bupivicaine ) alone , use local anesthetic local steroid injection . The purpose study evaluate whether observed difference two treatment approach GONB . We expect enroll 60 patient research study Thomas Jefferson University .</brief_summary>
