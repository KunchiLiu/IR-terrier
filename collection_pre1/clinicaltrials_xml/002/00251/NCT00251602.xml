	<brief_title>Analysis Atropine Propranolol Induced Changes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy volunteer recruit screened eligibility . Participants place three possible group base genetic information obtain screening . Rolling admission continue least 10 participant recruit genetic group . Participants randomly assign receive either control ( propranolol saline ) combine drug ( propranolol atropine ) treatment non-blinded fashion . The participant return one week later receive alternate treatment . Continuous heart rate/blood pressure data record end study period . Respiratory rate maintain fix rate . Participants undergo orthostasis task , receive drug control infusion , blood sample obtain determine drug concentration specific time interval . Several relatively new mathematical technique apply data .</detailed_description>
