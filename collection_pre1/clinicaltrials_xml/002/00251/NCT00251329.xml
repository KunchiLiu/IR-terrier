	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine combination safe effective situation especially increase rate pathological complete response ( PCR ) . Women large tumor lymph node involvement time initial diagnosis may benefit receive chemotherapy prior surgery shrink tumor decrease amount tumor involvement surgery . If chemotherapy give breast surgery effective decreasing size tumor , breast conserving surgery ( lumpectomy ) may possible . This new combination may better tolerate commonly use regimen , date , appear least effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel , Carboplatin , Capecitabine Treatment Patients With Locally Advanced Inflammatory Breast Cancer Before Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant ( primary ) chemotherapy use frequently locally advanced breast cancer effort reduce size primary tumor prior surgery eliminate micrometastatic disease.Through previous study , show patient receive neoadjuvant therapy demonstrate prolong disease-free survival compare pCR time surgery . It proven docetaxel single active drug metastatic breast cancer treatment therefore spark interest use neoadjuvant setting . There study conduct use docetaxel either alone combination set one particular study show patient treat docetaxel anthracycline –containing regimen achieve 34 % pCR compare 16 % anthracycline-containing regimen alone . This drug low incidence neutropenia administer weekly schedule , plus possible synergistic effect carboplatin capecitabine lead inclusion neoadjuvant protocol . Carboplatin agent recently integrate front line breast cancer treatment due response rate tolerability . This drug well warrant investigation neoadjuvant setting combine docetaxel one trial locally advance disease show preliminary pCR breast axilla 30 % 80 % respectively . Due tolerability , minimal toxicity , impressive result single agent combination docetaxel make carboplatin reasonable drug choice study . The novel oral agent capecitabine use protocol show study significantly increase response rate , time progression , even overall survival combine docetaxel metastatic setting . As well , capecitabine behaves similarly continuous 5-FU infusion show success several phase II neoadjuvant trial essentially lead inclusion study . Capecitabine ’ anti-tumor activity , couple ease administration , potential synergism docetaxel carboplatin , non-overlapping toxicity justifies inclusion investigational regimen .</detailed_description>
