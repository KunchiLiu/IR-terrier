	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine effect ( good bad ) safety Dynavax 's immunostimulatory phosphorothiolate oligodeoxyribonucleotide ( 1018 ISS ) give combination Rituxan patient B-cell follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . This research do recurrent follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma curable standard chemotherapy antibody treatment . 1018 ISS experimental compound consist short piece DNA stimulate immune system . It hop 1018 ISS may improve ability Rituxan kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Dynavax 's 1018 ISS , Following Rituxan Patients With B-Cell Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients receive four weekly infusion Rituxan standard treatment B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Approximately 30 60 minute second , third fourth infusion Rituxan , patient receive 3 injection 1018 ISS skin . The number injection depend upon patient weight . One week last Rituxan infusion patient receive fourth final injection 1018 ISS . - After completion 5-week treatment period , physical examination blood work perform . The patient also examine see tumor get small , big , stayed size place either CT scan MRI . A bone marrow aspiration biopsy do examine change bone marrow cell . - The following test perform determine whether patient eligible participate clinical study : Bone marrow aspiration biopsy ; lymph node biopsy ; skin biopsy ; standard x-ray test ( x-ray , CT scan , MRI , ultrasounds , and/or radioactive drug scan ) ; blood work . - While receive treatment patient follow procedure do ; Physical examination week 4 week , blood testing change blood , blood chemistry blood component . Patients also request keep diary study visit record health change over-the-counter medication herbal preparation may take .</detailed_description>
