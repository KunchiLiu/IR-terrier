	<brief_title>Efficacy Lapaquistat Acetate Subjects Currently Treated With Lipid-Lowering Therapy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus recognize cause secondary dyslipidemia , also independently consider major cardiovascular risk factor require aggressive lipid-lowering treatment . Type 2 diabetes account 85 % 90 % diabetes worldwide . It affect 2 % Caucasian population Westernized country , prevalence rise age 10 % 70 year age . Five percent young- middle-aged adult Asian Afro-Caribbean group United Kingdom condition . Approximately 12 million Americans type 2 diabetes , estimate 20 million degree glucose intolerance . The great cause mortality type 2 diabetes atherosclerotic vascular disease sequelae 75 % 80 % adult subject diabetes die macrovascular complication . Lapaquistat acetate squalene synthase inhibitor currently development Takeda treatment dyslipidemia . This study evaluate efficacy safety lapaquistat acetate co-administered establish lipid-lowering therapy include atorvastatin , simvastatin , rosuvastatin , fenofibrate subject type 2 diabetes mellitus .</detailed_description>
