	<brief_summary>This Phase II , open-label , non-randomized study patient advance non-squamous NSCLC . Each cycle 21 day . Patients evaluate every 2 cycle ( ~6 week ) response use RECIST criterion . Those patient achieve stable disease well continue therapy . Those patient experience progressive disease take study . Patients receive 6 cycle Eloxatin , Alimta , Bevacizumab . After 6 cycle , patient receive Bevacizumab alone every 21 day evidence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Note : Once patient complete 6 cycle Eloxatin , Alimta , Bevacizumab receive single-agent Bevacizumab , assessment response perform every 3 cycle ( ~every 9 week ) use RECIST criterion .</brief_summary>
