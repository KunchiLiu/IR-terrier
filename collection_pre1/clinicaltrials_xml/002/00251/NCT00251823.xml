	<brief_summary>Rationale : ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) usually trigger rupture atherosclerotic plaque accumulate platelet fibrin lead occlusive coronary thrombus . Clinical benefit obtain revascularization infarct relate artery ( IRA ) depend achievement four goal : 1 . Early reperfusion 2 . Full restoration normal flow epicardial vessel 3 . Full restoration flow microcirculation , 4 . Preservation myocardial function . Reperfusion IRA achieve pharmacologically intravenous thrombolytic agent , mechanically percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . In Canada , thrombolysis current standard care hospital , although mount evidence primary PCI superior , many Canadian centre shift towards strategy . To offer primary PCI community hospital without site cardiac catheterization facility , regional program need present allow rapid transfer invasive center offer procedure round-the-clock . Recent evidence suggest angiographic clinical result primary PCI could enhance facilitation pharmacological treatment give prior procedure . The present proposal plan examine safety efficacy eptifibatide facilitate coronary angioplasty STEMI patient present centre without on-site catheterization facility . The primary outcome measure composite clinical endpoint include death , recurrent myocardial infarction , recurrent unstable ischemia , stroke , 30 day . Secondary endpoint include percent thrombolysis myocardial infarction ( TIMI ) grade 3 coronary flow PCI , myocardial perfusion score , individual clinical outcome list primary endpoint , resolution ST-segment elevation , requirement subsequent revascularization , frequency congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , cardiogenic shock , Canadian Cardiovascular Society ( CCS ) angina class .</brief_summary>
