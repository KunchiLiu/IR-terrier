	<criteria>Male female patient 40 80 year age , inclusive . The patient seropositive evidence Chlamydia pneumoniae define immunoglobulin G antibody titer . The patient diagnosis intermittent claudication due PAD screening . The patient 's maximal effort PWT limit severe claudication symptom . If patient take cilostazol pentoxifylline stable dose medication least 6 month prior screen . Patients recently discontinue medication PAD and/or intermittent claudication must `` washout '' least one month prior screen . The patient stable dose statin therapy least 6 month prior screening.Patients recently discontinue statin therapy must `` washout '' least one month prior screen . Male female patient must agree use effective form birth control throughout study period . The patient critical limb ischemia evidence ischemic rest pain , ulceration , gangrene . The patient major amputation leg amputation limit walk ability . The patient plan surgical/endovascular intervention PAD course study . The patient treat evaluated tuberculosis . The patient know immunodeficient state ( e.g. , positive human immunodeficiency virus ) treat immunosuppressive drug include high dose steroid cyclosporine . The patient active infection require systemic oral antibiotic . The patient uncontrolled , unstable recently diagnose autoimmune disease , include limited systemic lupus , inflammatory bowel disease , sarcoidosis , rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis . Patients develop autoimmune disease course study must withdraw . The patient 's PWT limit symptom claudication ( shortness breath , fatigue , angina , arthritis ) . The patient history alcohol abuse , illicit drug use drug abuse significant mental illness . The patient know suspect allergy study medication ( ) class study medication ( rifamycins ) administer . The patient chronically use antibacterial previously receive rifalazil rifamycin ( e.g . rifampin ) . The patient uncontrolled hypertension ( rest blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mm Hg ) , uncontrolled moderate severe congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , uncontrolled arrhythmic disorder .</criteria>
