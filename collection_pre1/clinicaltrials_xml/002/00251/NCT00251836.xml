	<brief_summary>The success kidney transplantation hamper shortage organ . One attractive strategy use kidney live donor . During donor operation kidney artery , kidney vein ureter interrupt far possible kidney sufficient length reconnection structure transplant operation . An adrenal gland situate upper pole kidney . While arterial supply accomplish many small vessel , venous drainage one vein . On right side adrenal vein empty directly inferior vena cava ( large vessel transport blood low body heart ) . In contrast , leave side adrenal vein empty kidney vein , turn drain inferior vana cava . Due anatomical difference left-sided removal kidney always necessitate interruption leave adrenal vein , right-sided kidney removal . As venous drainage leave adrenal gland close live kidney donation , gland likely functionally impair . This compare right-sided kidney donation , adrenal vein leave intact . These comparison perform adrenal function test , one week one month kidney donation . These function test consist blood value draw stimulation hormone drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adrenal Function After Living Kidney Donation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due lack suitable donor organ large proportion kidney transplantation perform living donor . In year 2002 number live donor surpass number cadaveric donor Switzerland ( Swisstransplant , Swiss Transplant Society 2005 ) . Kidney graft live donor superior long-term outcome ( Hariharan S , N Engl J Med 2000 ) . At University Hospital Zurich 28 84 kidney transplantation perform year 2004 living donor . During live donor nephrectomy renal artery renal vein transect far away kidney possible , ensure adequate vessel length subsequent transplantation procedure . The arterial supply adrenal gland accomplish several small vessel ( ca . 5-15 ) , venous drainage usually dependent single vein . While right-sided adrenal vein drain directly inferior vena cava ( IVC ) , left-sided adrenal vein drain renal vein . Variants relatively rare occur 5 % case ( Sebe P , Surg Radiol Anat 2002 ) . Therefore , donor nephrectomy leave kidney adrenal vein transect , necessary right side . The question address clinical trial whether left-sided donor nephrectomy affect leave adrenal gland . This might compensate immediately contralateral gland might lead measurable functional adrenal deficit . Such adrenal insufficiency could detrimental immediate postoperative course . The intermediate-term outcome adrenal gland also interest , impairment leave adrenal gland lead hypertrophy contralateral gland . Few scientific publication address question . There case report acute intra- postoperative adrenal insufficiency patient undergo nephrectomy adrenalectomy ( Cassinello Ogea C , Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim 2002 , Henrich WL , Urology 1976 , Messiant F , Ann Fr Anesth Reanim 1993 , Safir MH , Geriatr Nephrol Urol 1998 ) . A small prospective study patient undergo radical nephrectomy ( include adrenalectomy ) find sign adrenal insufficiency ( Bischoff P , Anaesthesist 1997 ) . However subgroup analysis newer study demonstrate adrenal insufficiency radical versus adrenal-sparing nephrectomy ( Yokoyama H , BJU Int 2005 ) . The study hypothesis left-sided donor nephrectomy ( i.e . transaction adrenal vein ) deleterious leave adrenal gland cause measurable transient adrenal insufficiency operation . The primary study endpoint assessment adrenal function donor nephrectomy . This do ACTH stimulation test , perform baseline , first week operation 4 week operation . Comparisons perform baseline postoperative value , well left-sided kidney donor ( n=20 ) right-sided kidney donor ( n=10 ) . A secondary study endpoint assess morphological response adrenal gland donor nephrectomy . To end MRI volumetry adrenal gland perform time point , hypothesis left-sided nephrectomy lead involution leave adrenal follow hypertrophy right adrenal .</detailed_description>
