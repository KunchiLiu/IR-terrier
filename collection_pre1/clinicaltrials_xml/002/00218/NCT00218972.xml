	<brief_summary>Endurance training documented effect hypertension . However , low moderate training intensity far study . High aerobic intensity , physiological consideration , prove effective also reduce high blood pressure . The present study randomise comparison high versus moderate intensity versus train group , general advice 24 hour blood pressure hypertensives . The training period 12 week , follow-up 1 year . Maximum oxygen uptake , quality life , leave ventricular function blood vessel reactivity also measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endurance training documented effect blood pressure hypertension . However , low moderate training intensity far study . Higher aerobic intensity base individual measurement maximum oxygen uptake efficient increase oxygen uptake , might prove effective lower blood pressure . Group training , hand individualise , less personnel require may prove cost effective . Endurance train show improve systolic diastolic leave ventricular function , well endothelial function . Both measure non-invasively ultrasound . The study open , randomise study four arm , comparing : - High aerobic intensity interval train - Moderate aerobic intensity train - Group train - Controls receive standard advice lifestyle train Training effect measure Max . Oxygen uptake , blood pressure continuous 24 hour ambulatory measurement , Left ventricular function echo Doppler endothelial function flow mediate vasodilation ultrasound . The effect exercise blood pressure dependent continue training . All patient follow one year .</detailed_description>
