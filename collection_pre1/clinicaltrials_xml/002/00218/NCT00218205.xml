	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial find effect epirubicin estramustine phosphate celecoxib PSA objective response patient hormone resistant prostate cancer well evaluate toxicity , quality life combination . Celecoxib FDA approve drug treat arthritis . Epirubicin , alone estramustine phosphate use treatment hormone resistant prostate cancer . These drug demonstrate evidence tumor blood vessel suppression combination three drug could possibly arrest tumor growth even make tumor decrease size .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must histologically prove adenocarcinoma prostate gland . Patient must evidence progressive metastatic disease ( e.g. , bone , pelvic mass , lymph node , liver lung metastasis ) within 6 week prior participation study . Patients must elevate PSA level evidence disease . While castrate , patient rise PSA two consecutive measurement least 1 week apart . The confirmatory PSA must obtain within 1 week prior study registration &gt; 10ng/ml . Patients bone metastasis ( i.e. , lack softtissue disease ) must PSA level &gt; 10 ng/ml . Patients soft tissue metastasis /or visceral disease must either measurable disease PSA level &gt; 10 ng/ml . Radiological evidence hydronephrosis constitute evidence metastatic disease . Patients must prior treatment bilateral orchiectomy primary hormonal therapy ( e.g. , estrogen therapy , LHRH analog + flutamide , etc . ) evidence treatment failure . NOTE : Patients undergone bilateral orchiectomy must continue LHRH agonist therapy ( e.g. , depot leuprolide goserelin ) receive protocol therapy . For patient previously treat flutamide ( Eulexin ) , nilutamide ( Nilandron ) , bicalutamide ( Casodex ) : Patients must discontinue flutamide nilutamide &lt; 4 week bicalutamide 6 week prior registration . Patients prior exposure anthracyclines estramustine phosphate . Patients must prior radiotherapy &lt; 4 week prior protocol treatment . Patients must previously receive Strontium 89 , Samarium 153 , radioisotope therapy . Patients must recover toxicity due prior treatment prostate cancer prior receive protocol treatment . Patients must adequate bone marrow function : ( WBC &gt; 4000/ mm3 , granulocytes &gt; 2000/ mm3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 , Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl &lt; 4 week prior participate study . Patients must follow chemistry value &lt; 4 week prior participate study : Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl Transaminases ( SGOT and/or SGPT ) &lt; 5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/d . creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min Alkaline phosphatase Â£ 5 x ULN Patients must active angina pectoris , know heart disease New York Heart Association Class IIIIV .
