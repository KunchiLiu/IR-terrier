Though patient complete inpatient treatment , keep follow-up appointment relapse rate high . More effective therapy need , especially view epidemic heroin addiction result spread HIV infectious disease . A recently-completed study 52 patient randomized oral naltrexone ( ON ) oral naltrexone placebo ( ONP ) show efficacy prevent relapse reduce HIV risk dropout problem 44 % ON patient proven relapse 6 month ( compare 16 % ONP patient ) . A large study 280 patient randomize ON ONP replicate result find indication add SSRI naltrexone may improve efficacy woman , probably tend high level psychiatric symptom men . We think retention outcome improve use longer act naltrexone preparation , study propose compare ON depot naltrexone implant ( DNI ) manufacture approve use Russia , provide opioid blockade 8-10 week .
