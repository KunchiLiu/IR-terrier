	<brief_title>Nebulizer Intervention Minority Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nebulizer use young child common prevalence 33-71 % child age 12 year . Nebulizers use primarily administer SABA medication , ( i.e. , albuterol ) anti-inflammatory medication ( i.e. , budesonide , cromolyn ) . Parents may prefer nebulizer delivery due inability young child coordinate respiration aerosol delivery many parent lack confidence administer metered-dose inhaler ( MDI ) medication young child . Physician preference nebulizer administration asthma medication low , favor due direct medication delivery respiratory system despite study indicate MDIs spacers effective nebulizer deliver asthma medication young child . Although national guideline recommend nebulizer mask child 2 year young asthma educational program lack specific content address appropriate nebulizer technique include symptom treat home , optimal length nebulized medication session , prevention SABA overuse appropriate cleaning maintenance device . Because overuse home nebulizer SABA medication associate fatal asthma , instruction supervision nebulized rescue medication delivery addition appropriate preventive medication use may reduce asthma morbidity mortality . The current study conduct determine effectiveness home-based nebulizer educational intervention ( NEI ) young child asthma . The intervention design teach early symptom recognition , appropriate medication use nebulizer technique home treatment acute asthma episode . Study outcomes include symptom frequency , activity limitation , emergency department ( ED ) visit hospitalization , appropriate asthma medication use nebulizer practice . We hypothesize child receive NEI would demonstrate improvement appropriate nebulizer asthma medication use decrease asthma symptom , activity limitation , ED visit hospitalization .</detailed_description>
