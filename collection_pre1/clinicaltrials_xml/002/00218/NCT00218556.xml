We expect , relative SC condition , participant randomize CBT-D condition decrease likelihood depression-related antiviral treatment failure , report low level depressive symptom , complete IFN injection , low HCV RNA level , few illicit drug use day . If efficacy intervention establish trial subsequent clinical trial , MMT patient elect undergo antiviral therapy valuable adjunct alternative use antidepressant prevent depression . If find efficacious , intervention maximize receipt IFN treatment MMT patient , thereby aid prevention liver failure , hepatocellular carcinoma , liver-related death among HCV .</detailed_description>
