	<brief_title>Effectiveness N-Acetylcysteine ( NAC ) Treating Cocaine Dependent Individuals - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , effective pharmacological treatment exist cocaine dependence . Long-term use cocaine disrupts normal glutamate level . If addict stop use cocaine , glutamate level drop , encourage addict continue seek drug . NAC drug increase intracellular cysteine level , turn lead normalization glutamate level . Currently , NAC use treatment cystic fibrosis , heart disease , acetaminophen overdose . Since NAC capability restore normal glutamate level , hold potential treatment cocaine dependence . The purpose study determine safety effectiveness NAC treat cocaine dependent individual . In addition , study evaluate cocaine crave withdrawal symptom individual take NAC . Participants double-blind , placebo-controlled trial randomly assign receive either NAC placebo . All participant undergo initial evaluation , include physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood sample , urine test , cue reactivity measure . Participants NAC group receive either 600 mg 1200 mg NAC , two time day 8 week . In addition , participant receive cognitive behavioral therapy throughout study weekly basis . Cocaine use confirm urine drug screen test , three time week . Participants assess number biomedical psychosocial variable know influence cocaine treatment outcome . After Week 2 , participant repeat cue reactivity procedure , include measure participant 's crave response expose conditioned reminder prior cocaine use .</detailed_description>
