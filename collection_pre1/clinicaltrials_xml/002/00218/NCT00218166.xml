	<detailed_description>Cocaine likely create reinforce addictive effect increase level dopamine , brain neurotransmitter . GABA agonists chemical opposite effect inhibit release dopamine . Increasing GABA activity may result great inhibition dopamine system , may lead new treatment cocaine abuse . The purpose study determine whether pretreatment GABA agonists reduces psychological physiological reinforcing effect cocaine . Specifically , study look three different GABA agonist : tiagabine , baclofen , trazolam . This double-blind , placebo-controlled study involve three separate experimental phase ; phase last 4 week test one three GABA agonist ( tiagabine , baclofen , trazolam ) . Daily test session last approximately 6 hour . One four GABA agonist dose treatment administer . Participants introduce sample dose intranasal cocaine . This allow participant become acquainted drug effect correspond cocaine dose day ( 0.444 , 5 , 10 , 20 mg ) . Subjective , physiological , performance measure obtain . This follow period cocaine self-administration . Participants give opportunity work computer obtain additional single unit dose cocaine . A total 8 unit dos cocaine available daily session . At end daily session , additional subjective measure evaluate questionnaire . Overall , total 16 GABA agonist-cocaine dose combination administer 16 different day . A subgroup participant also undergo similar procedure option acquire money instead cocaine . At end study , participant offer referral appropriate drug-abuse treatment program .</detailed_description>
