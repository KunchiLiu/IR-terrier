	<brief_summary>Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) approve chemotherapeutic drug treatment androgen-independent prostate cancer . The aim study investigate whether addition investigational drug PI-88 increase efficacy docetaxel disease . PI-88 inhibits cancer growth inhibit development new blood vessel starve tumour oxygen nutrient ( anti-angiogenic ) . Because PI-88 docetaxel different mechanism action , expect increase ( synergistic ) activity combine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Efficacy Study PI-88 With Docetaxel Treat Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial multi-centre , open-label randomise phase II study patient androgen-independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) , lead-in combination tolerance study . The aim lead-in phase establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) PI-88 administer either 4 days/week 7 days/week ) combination fix dos docetaxel ( 75 mg/m^2 every 21 day ) prednisone ( 5 mg twice daily ) . In randomized phase II component , patient receive PI-88 MTD , either 4 days/week 7 days/week , combination docetaxel prednisone . The patient receive 10 treatment cycle combination therapy . Response treatment assess measure serum level prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) . Other efficacy measure include radiological assessment , progression-free survival , overall survival quality life .</detailed_description>
