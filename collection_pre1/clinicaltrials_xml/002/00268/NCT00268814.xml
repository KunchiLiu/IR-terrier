	<detailed_description>Detailed description study phase 1 ( randomize , control part study ) . Part B - Study phase 1 B1.1 Clinical hypothesis Compared maintenance oral methadone , heroin treatment lead - significant improvement physical and/or mental state health , - great reduction illicit drug use therefore great detachment drug scene , - significant improvement social situation , - high retention rate attachment treatment , case heroin dependent person could effectively reach could sufficiently profit methadone maintenance programme . B1.2 Primary outcome criterion - Improvement physical mental state health ( A ) AND - Reduction illicit heroin use non-increase cocaine use ( B ) . B1.3 Secondary outcome criterion - Retention rate - Reduction benzodiazepine , amphetamine , alcohol drug use - Reduction scene contact / contact drug consumer - Decrease delinquent behaviour - Stabilisation housing situation - Establishment new social contact - Improvement quality life - Mortality rate . B2 . STUDY DESIGN Phase 1 clinical trial consist 4 x 2-branched randomise multicentre study . The sample stratify consist one hand heroin dependent person methadone maintenance treatment sufficiently profit treatment ( MS ) , hand heroin dependent person currently treat addiction ( NE ) . Patients target group meet admission criterion randomise four arm : experimental group ( MS-E-C ) ( NE-E-C ) : heroin treatment concurrent case management , experimental group ( MS-E-P ) ( NE-E-P ) : heroin treatment concurrent psychoeducation/drug counseling control group ( MS-K-C ) ( NE-K-C ) : methadone treatment concurrent case management , control group ( MS-K-P ) ( NE-K-P ) : methadone treatment concurrent psychoeducation/drug counseling . B2.2 Recruitment patient The period registration part individual study period . A screening carry registration concern certain inclusion criterion . The patient give opportunity thorough information concern condition course study . First , patient ask sign consent participate study . This follow indication assessment ( T-1 ) study physician external interview ( EuropASI ) . Certain ( particularly medical ) characteristic examine begin treatment ( T0 ) . The regionally responsible study physician decide inclusion study . His decision need confirmation regional committee expert . B2.3 Randomisation The allocation treatment place experimental control group carry accord randomisation code . Randomisation do separately group ( MS NE ) base permuted block fix size . After evaluation indication assessment first interview ( T-1 ) , patient recruit fulfil inclusion criterion ask give second consent participation study , result randomisation communicate . B2.4 Course study , examination time investigations The first phase clinical trial cover period 12 month . All question do personal interview ( `` face face '' ) assurance information confidential . All patient take part interview receive expense allowance Euro 15.- survey . A hair sample already take indication examination ( T-1 ) . This allow take hair sample fit analysis begin treatment ( T0 ) patient whose hair short T-1 . The CIDI carry one month treatment order minimise initial influence require treatment . In order determine use illicit heroin , main target criterion , five urine control thoroughly examine GC/MS 6th 12th month treatment . B3 . PATIENTS The adequate treatment question pose study require number least 140 patient test group ( 4 experimental 4 control group ) . Therefore , sample size entire study N=1,120 . B3.1 Inclusion criterion Patients fulfil follow criterion include study : - Minimum age 23 year - Opiate dependence least 5 year - Current main diagnosis opiate dependency accord ICD-10 criterion - Current daily predominantly intravenous heroin use continue heroin use maintenance treatment - Symptoms physical illness indicate poor state health accord OTI health scale ; least 13 current symptom must find OR Current mental symptom disturbance , i.e . standardise GSI value SCL-90-R least 60 point - No participation addiction treatment programme ( a.a. maintenance , inpatient outpatient treatment ) least within last 6 month , document previous experience drug therapy OR Negative course maintenance treatment accord guideline German Medical Council due ( ) continuous additional use heroin ( 50 % urine sample positive within last 6 month ) cocaine ( harmful use cocaine/crack accord ICD-10 ) document maintenance period least 6 month current maintenance dose least 60 mg l methadone ( 30 mg levomethadone ) daily - Residence city ( city state ) region least 12 month - Voluntary participation ability comply treatment condition - Written consent comply treatment condition . B3.2 Exclusion criterion Persons least one follow criterion include study : - Persons currently prison await trial expect take custody within next 3 month - Persons voluntary phase abstinence least 2 month last 12 month - Known epilepsy generalise convulsion last 12 month - Hypersensitivity test substance additives - Regular intake MAO inhibitor - Serious bronchial asthma , COPD , Cor pulmonale - Serious cardiac arrhythmia - Prostatic hypertrophy ( urinary retention ) - Urethral stricture - Life threaten liver disorder ( exogenous hepatic coma ) - Serious renal disorder - Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus - Diagnosed malignancy last 6 month - Pregnant woman nurse mother - Patients unable comply study condition , i.e . participation therapeutic scientific programme , due serious physical mental illness - Patients currently participate another clinical study concern evaluation addiction treatment programme . B3.3 Dropping treatment Participation study voluntary i.e . patient withdraw consent treat ( participation study ) time . Patients least one follow characteristic remove treatment : - Patients suffer serious somatic complication connection heroin methadone treatment continuation treatment would irresponsible opinion test study physician safety board - Patients abnormally change laboratory value continuation treatment would incur great health risk accord safety board 's decision - Patients turn treatment centre discontinue study medication period 14 day ( long ) self-provoked reason without give reason - Patients take custody one month longer - Heroin patient whose treatment must discontinue 3 month due hospitalisation special treatment - Patients , opinion study physician , want comply condition model project longer , i.e . participation therapeutic scientific programme - In case violence , threat violence person involve project patient - In case drug trafficking premise model project - In case theft , pass sale prescribe substance . B4 . TREATMENT B4.1 Treatment set Patients treated outpatient clinic . The set base least weekly contact treat physician . Detailed physical examination blood count ( 10 ml withdrawal ) take place start treatment 1 , 3 , 6 12 month . There weekly urine analysis ( qualitative proof ) . In addition , hair sample take inconspicuous place back head beginning treatment ( admission ) , 6 month examination 12 month . Patients influence alcohol , barbiturates benzodiazepine refuse heroin methadone dose . If excessive alcohol consumption suspect ( smell alcohol ) breath test undertaken . If breath test 0.1 , heroin methadone refuse . B4.3 Dose regimen Heroin ( combination methadone ) An additional medication d-1 methadone night offer start , i.e . second day treatment early . The administration heroin occur 3 time day opening hour set , morning , noon evening . In accordance Swiss Dutch study , maximum daily dose i.v . heroin 1,000 mg , single dose 400 mg . If methadone claim night , take premise even opening hour take drinkable , injectable single dose . The daily maximum dose additionally prescribe , l methadone exceed 60 mg. Methadone consumption control regular urine analysis . Heroin hand injectable single dos ( fill syrinx ) administer patient observation . Patients stay centre least 30 minute injection , order control possible unwanted effect . The different dose regimen ( dose regulation begin treatment interruption start different point , fade case ( un- ) plan treatment conclusion ) base methadone daily equivalence dos ( MTQ ) . According basic rule different dose regimen , individual dose i.v . heroin one day , alone combination oral methadone , must exceed MTQ previous day 50 % . Methadone Oral methadone administer day . It take premise observation drinkable , injectable single dose . There fixed maximum daily dose ; accord experience , dosages 40 160 mg/d methadone ( individual case 250 mg/d ) must expect . A 1 % methadone HCL solution recommend . Dose regimen conclusion treatment The conclusion treatment do step-by-step discontinuation i.v . heroin change oral methadone . The discontinuation medication ( i.v . heroin alone combination methadone ) do slowly . Preferably , reduction 10 % -20 % MTQ previous day . In case discontinuation complete within 2 week . Possible withdrawal symptom treat concomitant medication . B5 . VARIABLES B5.1 General patient characteristic General specific sample characteristic gender , age , length opiate dependency , number previous treatment , current social situation document . B5.2 Medical examination prescription data , laboratory parameter The daily amount heroin methadone hand registered prescription document . Medical examination document CRF . B5.3 Pharmacokinetics Since pharmacokinetics , analgetic effect , tolerance effect addiction potential heroin well know new finding expect within framework study , study focus mainly question concern effect safety medication . B5.4 Efficacy Primary outcome variable Efficacy investigate regard two primary outcome measure - improvement state health ( A ) reduction illicit drug consumption ( B ) . These criterion evaluate independently statistical comparative analysis ; success one treatment comparison treatment proven , analyse significant result point direction . State health ( A ) A1 . Physical state health : Number symptom accord health scale Opiate Treatment Index OTI T 1 T12 . VA1n = OTI-Health Scale ( 0 ≤ VA1n ≤ 50 ) . A2 . Mental state health : Global Severity Index GSI SCL-90-R T 1 T12 . VA2n = GSI value ( 0 ≤ VA2n ≤ 4 ) . The treatment response concern improvement state health give , one two criterion ( VA1 VA2 ) show improvement criterion show aggravation . Improvement aggravation define follow : - For physical state health ( VA1 ) : An improvement indicate decrease OTI health scale least 20 % least 4 point T12 compare T-1 , aggravation increase least 20 % . - For mental state health ( VA2 ) : An improvement indicate decrease GSI value least 20 % T12 compare T-1 , aggravation increase least 20 % . Illicit drug consumption ( B ) B1 . Use illicit heroin : Number illicit heroin-positive urine analyse 12 month treatment , i.e . among last 5 urine sample T12 . VB1n = number positive urine sample ( 0 ≤ VB1 ≤ 5 ) . If patient drop treatment , result T12 miss LOCF procedure possible miss urine sample 6th month treatment , least one follow-up occur within ITT method , patient 's self-reported data use illicit heroin ( physician-CRF ) use . If also miss , self-reported data external interview use . This base number day illicit heroin consumption last 30 day ( VB1 ' ) corresponding time investigation . VB1 ' n = number illicit heroin consumption day ( 0 ≤ VB1 ' ≤ 30 ) . B2 . Cocaine use : Cocaine concentration hair base hair analysis ( HAs ) T-1 T12 within follow proof limit : VB2 n = cocaine concentration ( VB2 n ≥ 1 μg/g ) . If patient drop treatment , result T12 miss LOCF procedure possible miss HA T6 , least one follow-up occur within ITT method , patient 's self-reported data cocaine consumption ( physician-CRF ) use . If also miss , self-reported data external interview use . This base number day cocaine use last 30 day ( VB2 ' ) corresponding time investigation . VB2 ' n = number cocaine consumption day ( 0 ≤ VB2 ' ≤ 30 ) . HA represent frequency integral intensity within ( past ) period observation assume average hair growth 10 mm per month . The low limit proof assume 1μg/g . An increase cocaine consumption accurately proven , value T12 increase 30 % comparison T-1 . ( If hair short - le 1.5 cm - take sample T-1 , do T0 . ) Decrease non-increase consumption define follow : - A decrease illicit heroin use assume proven , 2 5 urine sample test GC/MS 12th month treatment positive . If 4 urine sample available 12th month treatment , one urine sample may positive illicit heroin . If 3 urine sample available , none may positive illicit heroin order rat response . If few urine sample available 12th month treatment , analyse 6th month use ( LOCF ) , proceed accord evaluation pattern . Only usable urine analysis 6th month treatment exist , patient 's self-report use ( VB1 ' ) . A reduction illicit heroin consumption least 60 % T-1 T12 relation number consumption day last 30 day rat response . - The non-increase cocaine use proven ( provable ) cocaine concentration hair . If HA carry T12 , hair sample T6 use ( LOCF ) . Only usable HA neither available T6 ( due premature discontinuation treatment ) , patient 's self report ( VB2 ' ) use . A decrease change ( tolerance ± 2 day ) number consumption day within last 30 day T-1 T12 rat response . I.e . increase number day cocaine consumption last month 2 day compare T-1 still rat response ; increase T12 2 day rat non-response . It assume certain number patient prematurely ( initiation treatment within first 3 month ) drop-out treatment ( case methadone 20 % 40 % , case heroin 10 % -20 % ) , reach examination investigation . These patient summon examination fix time , 5 urine sample last month available . These patient without valid data rat non-responders heroin group `` bad case '' responder methadone group . Thus , rather high percentage dropout control group expect , would hardly possible prove su¬periority experimental treatment . In case , ( negative ) result study would cause problem attributable implementation measure circumstance target criterion evaluation change carry adequately . Under specified evaluation strategy , procedure measure consumption primary outcome measure exclusively objective method maintain . If 5 urine sample require within defined period 2 may positive , deviation pattern ( e.g . urine sample miss use , patient turn ) prevent primary outcome measure reliably investigate document . If happens T12 , compensation data T6 possible ( LOCF ) . It must assume , however , dropout occur often first week , day even im¬mediately begin treatment great number patient never reach point T6 necessary objective measuring ; therefore , realistic summon dropout urine sample 5 time weekly interval 6th 12th month . An increase cocaine use proven hair analysis ( HA ) . It must expect also case , various reason , certain number patient ( though much less ) provide hair sample T6 T12 . Therefore , miss useable data concern primary outcome measure illicit heroin use ( VB1 ) cocaine use ( VB2 ) respectively compensate patient 's report consumption last 30 day . This procedure objective possible ; result compensate subjective data exceptional case ( dropout , incorrect miss data ) . The general treatment response show improvement state health ( physical mental symptom ) decrease illicit heroin consumption well non-increase cocaine consumption begin treatment conclusion phase 1 study . B5.5 Safety Serious adverse event ( SUE ) , adverse event ( UE ) side effect ( UAW ) must record consistently throughout study . Side effect investigate quantitatively . At investigation , follow effect side effect relate intoxication examine routinely . The blood control carry within study check laboratory test abnormality . Such change document CRF add adverse event ( UE ) , applicable , unwanted side effect ( UAW ) . B6 . STATISTICAL ANALYSES B6.1 Safety analysis Under inclusion person randomise , analysis emergency , adverse event ( UE ) serious adverse event ( SUE ) carry . With regard event ( prevalence , severity classification ) potential group difference check statistical significance . B6.2 Efficacy analysis The primary outcome analysis carry accord `` intention treat '' principle ( ITT ) , include randomised patient , i.e . patient assign one treatment group twice repeat write consent . With regard 4 x 2-branched study design , 4-factorial logistic regression model use . In case miss information , `` last observation carry forward '' method ( LOCF ) apply . Primary outcome analysis For experimental control group , proof superiority heroin furnish 4-factorial logistic regression model ; two separate analysis calculate criterion `` improvement state health '' ( A ) criterion `` reduction illicit drug consumption '' ( B ) . An overall success study ( proof superiority heroin treatment compare methadone treatment ) assume , main target criterion ( A ) `` improvement state health '' main target criterion ( B ) `` reduction illicit drug consumption '' , superiority heroin treatment comparison methadone treatment proven respective logistic regression model α-error 5 % . Primary outcome criterion ( A ) - Improvement state health : H0A : OR ≤ 1 ( Response rate heroin treatment ≤ Response rate methadone treatment ) , H1A : OR &gt; 1 ( Response rate heroin treatment &gt; Response rate methadone treatment ) . The hypothesis test one-tailed 2.5 % alpha error level . Primary outcome criterion ( B ) - reduction illicit drug consumption : H0B : OR ≥ 1 ( Rate illegal drug use heroin treatment ≥ methadone treatment ) , H1B : OR &lt; 1 ( Rate illegal drug use heroin treatment &lt; methadone treatment ) . This hypothesis also test one-tailed 2.5 % alpha error level . Proof overall effect heroin treatment : The experimental treatment ( control heroin treatment ) rat successful , logistic regression follow result : - response rate outcome criterion `` improvement state health '' ( A ) signifi¬cantly high comparison control treatment ( methadone maintenance ) AND - response rate outcome criterion `` reduction illicit drug consumption '' ( B ) significantly high comparison control treatment ( methadone maintenance ) . Secondary outcome analyse The secondary evaluation carry accord scale level variable index form ( maintenance rate , drug consumption , scene contact , delinquency , housing situation , social contact , quality life , mortality rate ) , i. e. bivariate multivariate analysis . B6.3 Sample size determination The calculation sample size base follow efficacy expectation : • Primary outcome criterion ( A ) - improvement state health : Efficacy expectation control group : ≤ 30 % responder , Efficacy expectation experimental group : &gt; 50 % responder . • Primary outcome criterion ( B ) - reduction illicit drug consumption : Efficacy expectation control group : ≤ 30 % responder , Efficacy expectation experimental group : &gt; 50 % responder . Within framework 4 x 2-branched study design , primary outcome criterion analyse 4-factorial logistic regression analysis . With ( conservative ) assump¬tion target criterion stochastically independent , power 90 % main out¬come criterion guarantee ( multiple ) total power 80 % maintain [ ( 1-β ) 2 ≈ 0.80 β = 0.10 ] . Since total success study assume treatment effect evident primary outcome measure , correction type-1-error necessary . A certain number patient ( prematurely ) drop-out treatment include evaluation LOCF , reach examination interview . These patient drop prior T6 start treatment refuse consent investigation two primary outcome variable . According conservative evaluation strategy , patient must treat `` bad case '' . Therefore , size assume effect decrease relation percentage `` reach '' patient heroin methadone group . Realistic estimation percentages 10 % drop-outs methadone group 5 % heroin group . According expected percentage , estimate effect size calculation sample size base , reduce 0.3 vs. 0.5 0.370 vs. 0.475 . Based assumption , multiple total power 80 % require number case least N=482 test person sample group ( base Chi2-test odds ratio , sample size approximation accord Nam 1992 ) . Related individual stratum , mean least four heroin four methadone stratum least 121 patient necessary prove expect effect statistical power 80 % . For practical reason ( adequate distribution study cen¬tres , increase measure precision ) , number round N=140 result eight stratum total number N=1,120 patient . Under described condition , sample size guarantee test significant difference methadone heroin treatment proven statistical total power least 80 % . B6.4 Missing data If data 12-months examination miss concern primary outcome criterion replace LOCF method , non-fulfillment criterion must assume , interpret `` bad case '' individual case . B6.5 Drop-outs Patients drop treatment continue include investigation evaluation ( ITT-analysis ) . According LOCF method , late information patient use analysis patient interview conclusion study . As far primary outcome criterion illicit heroin consumption concern , 12-month information complete investigation T6 , five urine sample 6th month treatment test illicit heroin GC/MS . Similarly , miss hair analysis cocaine consumption T12 complete hair sample precautiously take T6 . If objective measure result primary outcome measure illicit heroin cocaine consumption available , patient 's self-report include analysis . Patients participate investigation inclusion study rat `` bad case '' , i.e . reach patient methadone group rat success ( responder ) reach patient heroin group failure ( non-responders ) . Patients die first phase study rat ( experimental control group ) non-responders . Patients , withdraw consent randomisation initiate study treatment , exclude ITT-analysis .</detailed_description>
