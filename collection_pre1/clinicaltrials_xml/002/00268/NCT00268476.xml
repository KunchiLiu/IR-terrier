	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer depend upon male hormone testosterone growth . Lowering testosterone level ( either remove part testis , give anti-hormone treatment ) slow growth prostate cancer . This type treatment call hormone treatment often used prostate cancer spread outside prostate gland . Although hormone treatment usually successful stop cancer grow period time , cancer begin grow men . There increase number treatment available advanced prostate cancer . These treatment usually use prostate cancer hormone treatment longer effective cancer start grow . The aim trial , call STAMPEDE , assess five treatment , give early course disease combination hormone treatment . The treatment assess trial : 1 . Zoledronic acid : Prostate cancer cell spread bone weaken . Zoledronic acid drug reduces bone destruction hardens bone . This may make resistant attack cancer cell . 2 . Docetaxel : A drug stop cell replicate , Docetaxel currently use treat range cancer include lung , breast ovarian cancer well prostate cancer . Docetaxel already know prolong survival men relapse metastatic prostate cancer . 3 . Celecoxib : An aspirin-like drug use treat arthritis . Celecoxib slow growth cancer cell laboratory . We wish see effect cancer cell patient . Recruitment new patient evaluation drug finish pre-planned interim analysis fail demonstrate sufficient activity . 4 . Abiraterone ( include protocol version 8.0 ) : An inhibitor steroid hormone synthesis block prostate cancer cell generate male hormone . This think major way prostate cancer cell resume growth follow castration base therapy . This agent give along prednisolone already know prolong survival give men follow failure docetaxel chemotherapy . 5 . Prostate radiotherapy ( include protocol version 9.0 ) : Treatment high-energy x-ray target prostate gland . This treatment mandatory patient cancer confine prostate gland large trial show improves survival time . We interest whether give radiotherapy prostate cancer already spread . 6 . Enzalutamide ( include protocol version 12.0 ) : This blocker androgen receptor . These stimulate cancer hormone therapy fail . Enzalutamide may mutually complementary abiraterone term block mechanism resistance . The agent prolongs survival give men follow failure docetaxel chemotherapy . STAMPEDE look effect combine one two treatment describe hormone treatment . A computer program use allocate treatment patient receives , use chance process . The trial look effect combine treatment quality life find whether new treatment combination increase time cancer grow ultimately result patient live longer . The study also look treatment provide great value money health service . More 8,000 patient join trial answer become available 7 12 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>STAMPEDE : Systemic Therapy Advancing Metastatic Prostate Cancer : Evaluation Drug Efficacy : A Multi-Stage Multi-Arm Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare safety Androgen Deprivation Therapy ( ADT ) alone vs ADT vary combination enzalutamide abiraterone and/or radiotherapy prostate ( previously celecoxib , zoledronic acid , docetaxel abiraterone alone ) patient locally advance metastatic prostate cancer . - Compare failure-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , multicenter , pilot study . Patients currently randomise 1 3 treatment arm ( A , H J ) . The arm close recruitment . - Arm A ( Androgen Deprivation Therapy [ ADT ] ( plus RT newly-diagnosed non-metastatic disease ) [ control ] ) : Patients undergo bilateral orchidectomy receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) analogue achieve castration level testosterone . - Arm B ( ADT zoledronic acid ) : Patients undergo ADT ( +/- RT ) arm A . Patients also receive zoledronic acid IV 15 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course every 4 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( longer recruit ) . - Arm C ( ADT , docetaxel , prednisolone ) : Patients undergo ADT ( +/- RT ) arm A . Patients also receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 oral prednisolone twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( longer recruit ) . - Arm D ( ADT celecoxib ) : Patients undergo ADT arm A . Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( longer recruit ) . - Arm E ( ADT , zoledronic acid , docetaxel , prednisolone ) : Patients undergo ADT ( +/- RT ) arm A . Patients also receive zoledronic acid arm B docetaxel prednisolone arm C ( longer recruit ) .. - Arm F ( ADT , zoledronic acid , celecoxib ) : Patients undergo ADT arm A . Patients also receive zoledronic acid arm B celecoxib arm D ( longer recruit ) . - Arm G ( ADT abiraterone ) : Patients undergo ADT ( +/- RT ) arm A . Patients also receive oral abiraterone daily together prednisolone prednisone 5mg daily prevent secondary ACTH excess ( longer recruit ) . - Arm H ( ADT radiotherapy prostate ) : Patients ( newly-diagnosed-metastatic ) undergo ADT , arm A . Patients also receive radiotherapy prostate . Two radiotherapy dose-fractionation schedule permit . In either case , radiotherapy prescribe least 95 % PTV receive prescribe dose : 36Gy 6 fraction 6Gy , administer weekly 6 consecutive week 55Gy 20 fraction 2.75Gy , administer daily , five day per week , 4 consecutive week . - Arm J ( ADT , enzalutamide abiraterone ) : Patients undergo ADT , arm A . Patients also receive oral enzalutamide daily abiraterone daily together prednisolone prednisone 5mg daily prevent secondary ACTH excess . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK .
