	<brief_title>Aerosol Cyclosporine Prevention Lung Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Success lung transplantation largely due introduction cyclosporine prove effective control lung allograft rejection . Nevertheless , acute chronic rejection prevalent spite immunosuppressive drug regimen base oral cyclosporine . In fact , rejection common recipient lung allograft receive solid organ . Acute rejection treat pulsed methylprednisolone anti-lymphocyte globulin consequently recipients subject increase risk infection drug toxicity . The hypothesis test study delivery cyclosporine transplant lung aerosol inhalation would achieve high concentration cyclosporine graft deliver via bloodstream high concentration graft would prevent rejection effectively systemic immune suppression reduce toxicity . Cellular rejection occur 90 % patient within first year often progress obliterative bronchiolitis ( OB ) common cause death one year transplant . In 1988 , lung transplant group University Pittsburgh decide pursue cyclosporine aerosol treatment acute rejection . After animal testing , initial human experiment perform , suggest cyclosporine aerosol decrease prevalence acute rejection development obliterative bronchiolitis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This prospective double blind randomize trial design evaluate efficacy cyclosporine aerosol versus placebo aerosol adjuvant oral immunosuppression tacrolimus , prednisone , azathioprine . The hypothesis test include : 1 ) acute rejection would lower patient receive cyclosporine aerosol , 2 ) maintenance cyclosporine aerosol would result reduce incidence OB , 3 ) cytokine chemokine release would suppress , 4 ) patient receive cyclosporine aerosol would require less systemic immunosuppression 5 ) would lower incidence opportunistic bacterial infection consequence effective immunosuppressive therapy . Another specific aim study determine optimal dose cyclosporine aerosol reduce rejection and/or OB correlate radioisotopically label inhalation study easily measurable index affect deposition aerosolize medication .
