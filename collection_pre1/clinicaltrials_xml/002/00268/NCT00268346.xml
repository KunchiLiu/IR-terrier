	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Esophageal Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Explore activity single agent gefitinib , term response rate , patient population recurrent metastatic esophageal gastroesophageal junction cancer . Secondary - Assess toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord prior treatment ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily least 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 76 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
