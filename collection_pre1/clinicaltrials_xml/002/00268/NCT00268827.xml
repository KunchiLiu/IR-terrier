	<brief_title>A Comparison Study Kaletra Soft-Gel Capsules Kaletra Tablets African American Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The demand once-a-day easily tolerate therapy increase . While Abbott Laboratories 418 study demonstrate efficacy Kaletra® BID QD dose capsule , pill count QD dosing may decrease attractiveness population . In patient , issue diarrhea , nausea , food restriction , need refrigerate medication may also impact quality life possibly lead non adherence ultimately treatment failure . Moreover , believe diarrhea associate Kaletra® capsule may result capsule excipients unrelated active drug . Kaletra® long track record highly potent selective protease inhibitor resistance evidence Phase II Study 720 . The result study demonstrate ABT-378/ritonavir therapy highly potent , durable , well tolerate administer concomitantly two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1 infected individual . A high proportion subject achieve normal viral suppression ( &lt; 50 copies/ml – 78 % ITT ) . No discontinuation due study drug -related clinical laboratory adverse event occur first 48 week study common adverse effect diarrhea ( 25 % ) . Given high oleic content capsule , dose six capsule may cause “ bolus ” acid lead increased diarrhea . Because viral suppression advantage , desire see difference quality life tolerability soft-gel capsule new tablet formulation Kaletra® allow few tablet per day include additive possibly associate increased diarrhea . Study MOO-267 ( PLATO ) , multi-center study evaluate demonstrate improved quality life switch regimen ( efavirenz , nevirapine , indinavir , nelfinavir ) Kaletra® . Instruments used measure change quality life include AIDS Clinical Trial Group ( ACTG ) Symptom Distress Module ( ASDM ) measure presence bothersome symptom commonly see HIV ARV treatment ; Medical Outcomes Study-HIV Health Survey ( MOS-HIV ) widely use evaluate Quality Life ( QOL ) HIV infected patient ; Center Epidemiological Studies Depression ( CES-D ) , validate self-reporting questionnaire use screen tool depression . The hypothesis patient ’ quality life improve switch Kaletra® soft-gel Kaletra® tablet . The tablet formulation Kaletra® improve quality life simplify current HAART regimens decrease pill count , improve tolerability , eliminate food restriction need drug refrigeration . African-American subject select study understudied population due adherence behavior . In review Abbott Study 418 Study MOO 267 percent African-American enrollee account 27 % 15 % study group respectively.1,4 In study association socio demographic factor adherence behavior , direction consistent : young age , non-white race , low income , low literacy unstable housing associate non-adherence . Adherence behavior refers extent patient take medication prescribe health provider . As stated , patient young , non white race , low income live unstable housing less likely adhere prescribe medication regime . It important evaluate antiretroviral therapy formulation validate patient tolerability acceptance order promote drug adherence . This study compare tolerability acceptance patient Kaletra® soft-gel capsule Kaletra® tablet formulation utilize validated instrument describe .</detailed_description>
