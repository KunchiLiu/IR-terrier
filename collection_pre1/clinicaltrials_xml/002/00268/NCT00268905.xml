	<criteria>1 . Patients ≥ 18 year age . 2 . Patients Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status score 0 1 . 3 . Patients life expectancy ≥ three month . 4 . Patients adequate renal function evidence serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min per Cockcroft Gault formula . 5 . Patients adequate bone marrow function evidence absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L , hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL ( may correct transfusion growth factor ) platelet count ≥ 100 × 10^9/L . 6 . Patients adequate liver function evidence bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( case liver metastases ≤ 5 x ULN ) , unless bone metastasis , case liver specific alkaline phosphatase must separate total use ass liver function instead total alkaline phosphatase . ass liver function instead total alkaline phosphatase . 7 . Patients willing able comply study protocol duration study . 8 . Written inform consent prior studyspecific screening procedure understand patient may withdraw consent time without prejudice . For patient dose finding phase , follow additional inclusion criterion must fulfil : 1 . Patients pathologically diagnose , histologically cytologically confirm advanced solid tumor , progress follow standard therapy standard therapy exists ( include surgery radiation therapy ) . 2 . Patients disease progression despite standard therapy disease standard therapy exists . 3 . Patients ≤ Grade 2 chemotherapy radiationrelated toxicity except alopecia . For NSCLC patient MTD , follow additional inclusion criterion must fulfil : 1 . Patients pathologically diagnose , histologically cytologically confirm advanced NSCLC ( Stage IIIB IV ) measurable disease , amenable surgical radiation treatment . 2 . Patients prior chemotherapy NSCLC include neoadjuvant adjuvant treatment . 1 . Patients exclude receive follow within three week prior first study treatment : investigational drug , immunotherapy , gene therapy , hormone therapy ( except leuprolide , megestrol acetate appetite stimulation ) , biological therapy , chemotherapy radiation . Patients major surgery without full recovery major surgery within 3 week prior first study treatment also exclude . Patients must recover previous major therapyrelated toxicity ( Grade 3 4 ) &lt; Grade 2 study entry ( except neuropathy ) . 2 . Patients receive radiation ≤ 3 week prior study enrollment , whose marrow exposure exceed 30 % recover toxic effect treatment prior study enrollment ( except alopecia ) . 3 . Patients receive prior high dose chemotherapy hematopoietic stem cell rescue stem cell bone marrow transplant past two year . 4 . Patients pulmonary lymphangitic involvement result pulmonary dysfunction require active treatment , include use oxygen 5 . Patients active symptomatic brain metastasis . Patients central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases consider eligible adequately treat brain metastasis , ie , complete treatment ( tapered steroid ) least four week start treatment E7389 . Patients evidence metastasis symptomatic actively grow ( evidence midline shift compute tomography scan magnetic resonance imaging ) may enrol without initiation local therapy CNS metastasis . In case , repeat scan must perform within four week original scan ensure disease progression occur . It intention study treat patient active brain metastasis . 6 . Patients meningeal carcinomatosis . 7 . Patients require therapeutic anticoagulant therapy warfarin related compound . 8 . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential either positive pregnancy test Screening pregnancy test . Women childbearing potential unless ( 1 ) surgically sterile ( 2 ) use adequate measure contraception opinion investigator ( e.g. , use 2 form contraception include barrier method ) . Perimenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . 9 . Fertile men willing use contraception fertile men female partner willing use contraception . 10 . Patients severe/uncontrolled intercurrent illness infection . 11 . Patients significant cardiovascular impairment ( history congestive heart failure &gt; New York Heart Association Grade II , unstable angina myocardial infarction within past six month , serious cardiac arrhythmia ) . 12 . Patients organ allograft . 13 . Patients history positive test HIV and/or active hepatitis B active hepatitis C study entry . 14 . Patients preexist neuropathy &gt; Grade 2 . 15 . Patients hypersensitivity halichondrin B and/or halichondrin B chemical derivative . 16 . Patients participate prior E7389 clinical trial . 17 . Patients significant disease disorder , investigator 's opinion , would exclude patient study . For NSCLC patient MTD , follow additional exclusion criterion must fulfil : 1 . Patients prior malignancy , carcinoma situ cervix , nonmelanoma skin cancer , unless prior malignancy diagnose definitively treat ≥ five year previously subsequent evidence recurrence .</criteria>
