	<detailed_description>Both Aortic Mitral valve utilize bio-prosthetic and/or mechanical valve place adult since 1960s.The replacement valve child adolescent begin 10 year first adult valve replacement . The majority valve replace pediatric cohort due either stenosis ( narrow ) incompetancy native valve . Valvular stenosis pediatric patient normally congenital etiology , however , small percentage acquire infectious process . Stenosis valve impedes blood flow native valve orifice . Ventricular enlargement , hemodynamic instability /or major organ congestion ensue leave untreated . Dependant upon severity stenosis onset dysfunction , intervention may require age ( newborn adult ) . In order patient adequate blood flow systemic circulation ( body ) , diseased valve must replace . Children native valve stenosis experience failure thrive , frequent pneumonia , difficulty breathe generally poor physical development . If stenosis critical nature greatly affect hemodynamics , infant require intervention first day life . In patient , initially many stenotic valve open heart catheterization lab procedure call valvuloplasty . While procedure open valve leaflet apparatus , close approximation leaflet achieve residual insufficiency regurgitation present . Most infant heart handle minimal resurgent volume result cardiac chamber enlargement . It necessary surgically replace incompetent valve prosthetic valve child grows . If valvuloplasty unsuccessful , surgical intervention require relive valvular Stenosis improve hemodynamics . Heart valve insufficiency create resurgence blood back either leave atrium ventricle cause increase cardiac workload dilation respective chamber heart . Incompetence Aortic valve eventually cause congestive heart failure and/or sudden death arrhythmia . The initial surgery dependant size ventricle concomitant defect child may . A ventricle small support circulation change placement valve . These patient require staged surgery single ventricle palliative repair . Two example congenital cardiac defect include aortic stenosis cleave mitral valve . If aortic valve stenosed ventricle adequate size , Ross procedure do , The Ross procedure use patient ’ resect native pulmonary valve main pulmonary artery place aortic valve outflow tract . A cryo-preserved homograft place native pulmonary artery position . This homograft implant without valve dependant upon patient ’ size and/or native valve orifice . Mitral valve anomaly occur frequently patient Atrioventricular septal defect . With congenital defect mitral valve may dysplastic , cleave anterior valve leaflet . This affect competency valve , allow regurgitation blood flow leave atrium . This increase blood volume leave atrium eventually lead pulmonary hypertension . Because risk , repair Atrioventricular septal defect normally do age six twelve month . Repair mitral valve do time , knowledge mitral valve replacement likely child ’ future . Repair heart valve patient age always preferable replacement ; child especially true . Availability replacement valve infant size limit bio-prosthetic homograft . Cryo-preserved homograft make either porcine cadaver valve . These generally use pediatric patient age two year . Historically homografts develop significant amount stenosis/calcification suture site . In addition , child grows homograft size remain fix . Both problem require replacement . Implantation mechanical valve older child young adult consider treatment alternative . However , mechanical valve inherent complication secondary requirement long-term anticoagulant therapy ( blood thinner ) risk thromboembolic event . Structural malfunction valve growth patient result need replacement mechanical valve . Additionally , patient compliance dose management difficult control .</detailed_description>
