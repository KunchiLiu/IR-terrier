	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , pemetrexed disodium carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Pemetrexed disodium may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving radiation therapy together pemetrexed disodium carboplatin surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give radiation therapy together pemetrexed disodium carboplatin work treat patient locally advanced esophageal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary * Determine pathologic complete response rate radiotherapy , pemetrexed disodium , carboplatin administer prior esophagectomy patient locally advanced esophageal cancer . Secondary - Determine activity , term clinical response rate adverse event profile radiotherapy , pemetrexed disodium , carboplatin administer prior esophagectomy . - Determine overall survival , time-to-progression , time-to-treatment failure patient receive combined modality treatment . - Determine surgical outcome patient undergo esophagectomy . - Determine time-to-disease recurrence disease-free survival patient curative resection . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 5 ½ week concurrently receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 22 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients eligible undergo esophagectomy 4-12 week completion radiotherapy . Quality life assess baseline , immediately prior day 22 chemotherapy , within 2 week prior surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically approximately 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
