	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy effective give cisplatin together radiation therapy treat cancer oropharynx . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study combination chemotherapy radiation therapy see well work compare cisplatin radiation therapy treat patient stage III stage IV cancer oropharynx .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare overall survival patient previously untreated stage III IV squamous cell carcinoma oropharynx treat induction chemotherapy comprise docetaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil follow radiotherapy cisplatin versus radiotherapy cisplatin . - Compare progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare quality life functional status patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord primary cancer site ( base tongue v ) , nodal extent ( N0-1 v N2-3 ) , radiotherapy plan ( conventional [ 2-D 3-D conformal radiotherapy ] v intensity modulate radiotherapy ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( induction chemotherapy without salvage surgery follow chemoradiotherapy ) - Induction chemotherapy without early salvage surgery : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour cisplatin 30-60 minute day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 1-3 course . Patients achieve complete partial response primary site course 1 receive 2 additional course therapy proceed chemoradiotherapy within 3-4 week completion fluorouracil administration . Patients stable disease surgically resectable locoregional disease progression undergo early salvage surgery proceed concurrent chemoradiotherapy within 70 day surgery . Patients locoregional unresectable disease progression patient refuse early salvage surgery proceed directly concurrent chemoradiotherapy within 3-4 week completion fluorouracil administration . - Chemoradiotherapy : Patients undergo 2-D 3-D conformal radiotherapy intensity modulate radiotherapy daily 5 day week 7 week receive cisplatin IV 30-60 minute concurrently day 1 , 22 , 43* absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients undergo surgery chemoradiotherapy receive cisplatin day 1 22 6-week course radiotherapy . - Arm II ( chemoradiotherapy ) : Patients undergo 2-D 3-D conformal radiotherapy intensity modulate radiotherapy daily 5 day week 7 week receive cisplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 , 22 , 43 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , completion chemoradiotherapy , 12 month randomization . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 398 patient ( 199 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
