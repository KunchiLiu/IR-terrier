	<brief_summary>This single arm , multi-center , expand access study Iodine I 131 Tositumomab ( BEXXAR ) therapeutic regimen patient relapse refractory low-grade transform low-grade non-Hodgkin 's B-cell lymphoma . The primary objective make Iodine I 131 Tositumomab broadly available patient . Secondary endpoint obtain additional safety efficacy information treatment regimen . Post study drug administration follow-up continue ten year . These include blood-work adverse event assessment 13 week post dosing , patient response evaluation Week 13 , Months 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , Long-Term Follow-ups every 6 month elapse 5 year dosimetric dose annually thereafter year 10 . Thyroid function monitor annually Long-term follow-up .</brief_summary>
