	<brief_summary>lupus nephritis account morbidity mortality patient SLE . Glucocorticoids combine cyclophosphamide ( CYC ) effective treatment patient proliferative lupus nephritis immunosuppressive regimen choice many year . However , patient respond well regimen , adverse effect cyclophosphamide limit use certain patient . Leflunomide novel immunosuppressive agent currently use treatment rheumatoid arthritis.There pilot observational study report suggest leflunomide also safe , well-tolerated may effective SLE patient without important organ involvement . It show leflunomide used treatment patient lupus nephritis . We therefore undertook multi-center , control study investigate efficacy safety profile leflunomide compare cyclophosphamide treatment patient biopsy proven proliferative lupus nephritis .</brief_summary>
