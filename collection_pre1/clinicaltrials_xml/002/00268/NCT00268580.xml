	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether Emergency Department ( ED ) Asthma Care Project ( ACP ) lead improved asthma care delivery patient outcome ED set . Hypothesis : Implementation multi-disciplinary asthma strategy/clinical pathway treatment asthma ED , base upon 1999 Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines ( subsequent update ) , increase adherence publish management guideline ED setting , reduce variation emergency management acute asthma , increase utilization specialize asthma service improve outcomes patient follow ED visit . Methods : This observational , pre- post-intervention study compare stratify sample 10 Ontario hospital EDs ( 5 intervention 5 control site ) . Chart abstraction perform adult visit acute asthma 3 month period implementation Ontario Hospital Associations ( OHA ) 's ( Ontario Lung Association 's ( OLA 's ) ED Asthma Care Map . Patient provider survey provider focus group post intervention also conduct . Primary outcome measure hospitalization repeat ED visit rate . Secondary outcome measure include : length stay ED , self-reported adherence referral specialize asthma service make index ED visit , self-reported asthma control , use self-management strategy ( include use action plan ) , use asthma management strategy promote care map ( use objective measure airflow rate , use steroid , education , referral specialize asthma service discharge ) . Ease implementation barrier implementation also evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study finding may use support implementation standardize ED clinical pathway relate ED provider education program throughout Ontario . Specific Objectives : - To evaluate impact pathway patient . - To evaluate impact pathway health care provider . - To evaluate ease implementation pathway . Study Design : - Observational , pre- post-intervention study design . - Comparison intervention control sit . - Patient provider survey provider focus group post intervention Key Components : 1 . Pre- post- intervention chart abstraction key element process asthma care ED set 2 . Post-intervention telephone survey patient 3 . Post-intervention self-administered survey health care provider 4 . Post-intervention focus group Methodology : Background The Ontario Respiratory Outcomes Research Network ( ORORN ) complete Canadian Institutes Health Research ( CIHR ) -funded study `` Determinants Regional Variation Emergency Department Utilization Hospitalizations Asthma Ontario '' . This study include detailed chart abstraction process care ED well detail telephone questionnaire adult child present EDs treatment acute asthma stratify sample 14 hospital across Ontario March 2001 Feb 2002 . Data available 5,000 ED visit . It propose number site approach participate ED ACP . A sub-set data site provide baseline ( pre-intervention ) data , intervention control sit ED ACP could select ORORN study site . This would minimize ( potentially eliminate ) cost primary baseline data collection , expedite collection post-intervention data give familiarity sit research personnel previous study instrument protocol . Selection Intervention Control Sites Five intervention ( Kingston General Hospital , Belleville General Hospital , Sudbury Regional Hospital , Renfrew Victoria Hospital , Lake Woods District Hospital [ Kenora ] ) 5 control site ( Prince Edward County Memorial Hospital , Lakeridge Hospital [ Oshawa ] , St. Joseph 's Hospital [ Hamilton ] , Chatham District Hospital , Owen Sound District Hospital ) select . To ensure site representative Ontario , sit select base upon sample frame take consideration : - Hospital/community size location ( urban/rural ; geographic setting ) - Level care ( community/academic -tertiary/quaternary setting ) - Hospitalization rate asthma adult child - Presence local specialize asthma service - Access quality baseline ( pre-intervention ) data ORORN ED study database - Willingness site participate - Location Asthma Plan Action initiative might confound confound intervention Case identification within ED perform method use ORORN previous asthma ED study . This involve review ED log book present complaint potentially indicative asthma OR electronically available data disposition diagnose asthma . Potentially eligible patient approach outlined obtain informed consent . ED record ( log book ) participate hospital review local research assistant precede 24 72 hrs daily basis ( Monday Friday ) . Patient record chief complaint potentially indicative acute asthma exacerbation review capture patient discharge diagnosis acute exacerbation asthma . ED record follow complaint logbook review : asthma , shortness breath , wheeze , cough , chest tightness , difficulty breathing . To eligible disposition diagnosis ED sheet must asthma . Patients history asthma present reason acute exacerbation asthma ( prescription renewal unrelated complaint ) exclude . Eligible patient mail : 1 . An introductory letter ( Appendix A ) outline purpose study , inform contact research assistant within one week presentation hospital invite participate study 2 . A consent form ( Appendix B ) . The Research assistant contact patient telephone obtain informed consent . A telephone contact sheet ( Appendix C ) outline script use research assistant speak potential participant . Once consent obtain participant answer questionnaire ( telephone person ) . The questionnaire enter computerized version paper copy ( Appendix D ) . The patient chart abstract also use computerized version paper copy ( Appendix E ) . If patient re-presents ED within 14 day first visit research assistant contact participant obtain consent . Any visit within 14day period consider episode repeat consent require . Pre-Intervention Chart Abstraction Pre-intervention chart abstraction data obtain either : 1. ORORN ED study database , site participate previous ORORN study , contain data adult pediatric ED visit March 2001 February 2002 , OR 2. retrospective primary data collection ED visit asthma March 2001 February 2002 sit select participate previous ORORN ED study , utilize ORORN chart abstraction tool ( abbreviate audit use specific component tool ) . ( NOTE : If necessary , research team advisory committee need determine appropriate abbreviate time-period audit ( eg . 3 month rather full 12 month ) remain within budget meet target time-lines . ) Post-Intervention Chart Abstraction Post-intervention chart abstraction data obtain primary data collection , use ORORN chart abstraction tool ( abbreviation thereof ) . Post-Intervention Collection Administrative Outcomes Hospitalization rate , readmission rate , ED repeat visit rate asthma asthma-related condition ( define OHA Report Cards ) obtain site directly national administrative database ( CIHI , NACRS ) . Referral rate local specialize service collect relevant possible small community directly community resource involve . Post-intervention Survey Patients Patients eligible participate mailed introductory letter outline purpose study consent form . Subsequently , potential participant contact telephone research associate . After obtain informed consent , brief ( 5-10 minute maximum ) telephone interview perform . A questionnaire purpose develop , include data element ORORN regional variation study questionnaire enable comparison . It also include whether patient receive education referral ED visit , whether complied referral , question regard impact patient 's visit asthma self-management skill confidence . Post-intervention Self-administered Survey Health Care Providers A sample ED health care provider involve delivery aspects clinical pathway contact site , invite complete self-administered survey . A questionnaire purpose develop , include perceived change practice , perceive change knowledge recommend asthma management , perceive utility pathway , barrier pathway implementation , recommendation improvement . Post-intervention Site Representatives Focus Group A post-intervention focus group include representative participate site convene gain additional insight site specific aggregate outcome barrier would unlikely emerge without interaction find group . Aggregate data distribute site , site specific data individual site . The focus group invite : - assist interpretation quantitative finding ; - obtain perception project outcomes impact ; - identify project strength , weakness , recommendation ; - identify solution relate project implementation ; - generate new idea . Ethical Considerations This study approve Queen 's University Health Sciences Affiliated Teaching Hospital 's Research Ethics Board ( REB ) ( Appendix F ) . Ethics also seek participate site . The Queen 's submission share site study coordinator assist site , necessary , facilitate process . Access medical record seek institution . As study involve questionnaire data collect interview , stress may occur result perceived pressure answer specific question . Participants informed consent process participation voluntary , may choose answer specific question , may withdraw study time without affect future medical care . Patient confidentiality ensure time . Confidential individual identification number randomly generate sequentially web base data entry system , use link abstract data questionnaire data . Privacy officer contact participate site ensure protocol meet sit privacy protocol . Potential Outcome Measures : A . Impact pathway patient : 1 . Hospitalization rate length stay 2 . Length stay ED 3 . Relapse rate ED asthma , within 24 72 hour ED visit 4 . Self-reported adherence referral specialize asthma service make index ED visit 5 . Self-reported asthma control , use self-management strategy ( include use action plan ) B . Impact pathway provider : . Use Asthma Management Strategies Promoted ED ACP i. use objective measure airflow rate ( PEFR spirometry ) , gas exchange ( oxygen saturation , arterial blood gas ) ii . type asthma medication prescribe ( bronchodilator , corticosteroid ) ED upon discharge iii . route medication prescribe ( IV vs oral vs. inhaled steroid ; metered-dose inhaler ( MDI ) v nebulized bronchodilator ) iv . documentation assessment teach device technique v. documentation asthma action plan provision revision vi . type asthma education provide ( e.g . environmental trigger avoidance , warn sign , medication use ) vii . follow-up care recommendation referral ( AEC , Asthma Clinic , Respirology Clinic , family physician ) b . Utilization Specialized Asthma Services i. referral rate ( # /year ) local AECs Asthma Clinics ii . type provider involve emergency asthma care C. Ease implementation pathway/ Barriers implementation : 1 . Proportion patient enrol ED ACP ( Overall , patient age category physician specialty ) 2 . Differences patient demographic , physician demographic , day week , time day patient enrol vs. enrol 3 . Perceived utility pathway ( overall , site , profession )</detailed_description>
