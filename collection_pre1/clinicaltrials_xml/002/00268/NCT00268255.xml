	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Gefitinib may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving gefitinib together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose radiation therapy give together gefitinib see well work treat patient inoperable stage I stage II non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine toxicity profile maximum tolerate dose radiotherapy give combination gefitinib patient previously untreated , medically inoperable stage I II non-small cell lung cancer . ( Phase I ) - Determine efficacy gefitinib give 6 week prior concurrent radiotherapy , term objective response rate ( partial complete response ) , patient . Secondary - Determine 3-month tumor response ( complete partial response ) patient treat regimen . - Determine 6-week response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine local disease control rate ( complete partial response , stable disease ) patient treat regimen . - Determine local progression-free survival disease-specific survival ( cancer vs co-morbid disease ) patient treat regimen . - Determine pattern failure ( e.g. , local , regional , distant metastasis ) patient treat regimen . - Determine acute late radiation toxic effect organ risk patient treated regimen . - Determine safety profile gefitinib patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study radiotherapy . - Patients receive oral gefitinib daily 13 week . Patients also undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 7 week begin week 7 . Patients continue receive gefitinib alone completion radiotherapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 6-10 patient receive escalate dos radiotherapy maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 3 6 patient experience acute dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive oral gefitinib phase I radiotherapy MTD determine phase I . After completion radiotherapy , patient continue receive gefitinib absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 37 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
