	<brief_title>Study Sequential Topoisomerase , Irinotecan/Oxaliplatin - Etoposide /Carboplatin Extensive Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open label study either chemotherapy-naïve patient extensive SCLC patient refractory relapse 1st line therapy SCLC . The primary objective determine objective response rate . This study consist 2 part : Part I - Chemotherapy-naïve patient extensive SCLC • These patient treat sequential topoisomerase target regimen ( Regimen A B ) . Regimen A consists irinotecan oxaliplatin ( IROX ) , give Day 1 , Neulasta administer Day 2 . Regimen B consist etoposide carboplatin , give Day 15 ( etoposide give daily x 3 ) Neulasta Day 18 . Then , Regimen A give 3 week later . The first re-evaluation response perform 3 week second round sequential regimen . Schema Part I : Regimen A ( → 2 week ) Regimen B ( → 3 week ) Regimen A ( → 2 week ) Regimen B → ( 3 week ) → Re-Stage - The second re-evaluation response perform 3 week fourth round sequential regimen . At point patient stable disease observe ; either partial complete response treat another round sequential therapy ( Regimen A → Regimen B ) evidence unacceptable toxicity . At end ( 3 week ) fifth round chemotherapy , patient re-evaluated response , followed-up recurrent disease every 8 week . - Analysis Top I Top II level peripheral blood mononuclear cell perform 10 patient Part I . - Evaluation expression ERCC gene ( ERCC1 , ERCC2 , XPF ) perform patient Part I adequate tumor specimen . Part II - Patients either refractory disease relapse 1st line therapy • These patient treat Regimen A1 ( IROX ) 3-week interval . Neulasta administer Day 2 cycle . The first re-evaluation response perform 3 week 3rd cycle Regimen A1 . The second re-evaluation response perform 3 week 6th cycle Regimen A1 . At point , patient stable disease observe ; either partial complete response treat two additional cycle Regimen A1 evidence unacceptable toxicity . At end ( 3 week ) 8th cycle Regimen A1 , patient re-evaluated response , followed-up recurrent disease every 8 week . Schema Part II : Regimen A1 ( → 3 week ) Regimen A1 ( → 3 week ) Regimen A1 ( → 3 week ) Re-Stage</detailed_description>
