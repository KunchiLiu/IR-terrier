	<detailed_description>This study link DMID protocol 04-063 , 07-0022 08-0059 . DMID Study 05-0090 extension study DMID Study 04-063 . Between March May 2005 , DMID Study 04-063 enrol approximately 450 subject three study site . Subjects stratified age history prior influenza vaccination 2004-2005 season , randomly assign receive 2 dos saline placebo ( N=50 ) 7.5 , 15 , 45 , 90 mcg influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine ( N=100/dose group ) IM injection . Approximately 6 month receive second vaccination , subject enrol DMID Study 04-063 return clinic final study visit ( Visit 6 ) . After complete visit , include collection safety data 30-mL blood draw , unblinded vaccine administrator determine study subject receive placebo influenza A/H5N1 vaccine . In proposed extension study ( DMID Study 05-0090 ) , subject receive influenza A/H5N1 vaccine provide information DMID Study 05-0090 ask willing receive third dose vaccine dose level originally administer ( i.e. , subject originally receive two dos 7.5 mcg receive single booster dose 7.5 mcg , receive two dos 15 mcg receive single booster 15 mcg , etc. ) . Subjects provide inform consent eligible DMID Study 05-0090 give third dose vaccine dose level previously receive unblinded vaccine administrator . Symptoms sign assess clinic 15 30 minute inoculation , subject maintain memory aid record oral temperature systemic local adverse event ( AEs ) 7 day immunization . Subjects encouraged take temperature around time day . All subject receive safety follow-up telephone call 1 3 day elicit AE information 13 19 day vaccination elicit AE information review memory aid . Subjects return clinic 28 ( +/- 3 ) day vaccination assessment AEs concomitant medication , target physical examination ( indicate ) blood sample collection . During follow-up visit , subject identify `` high responder '' vaccine DMID 04-063 study also solicit participate blood specimen collection substudy . Subjects provided information substudy ask would consent additional 100 mL blood drawn blood sample collect serum antibody assay . Refusal consent substudy preclude subject continue booster vaccine trial . At approximately Day 180 ( 6 month booster vaccination ) , subject return clinic final immunogenicity blood sample collection follow-up , may include targeted physical examination ( indicate ) . The duration study treatment subject study 6 month .</detailed_description>
