	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether large dose aldosterone antagonist spironolactone combine ACE inhibitor ( captopril ) beta-blocker ( carvedilol ) effective reverse pulmonary artery remodel patient pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) secondary congenital heart disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spironolactone Combined With Captopril Carvedilol Treatment Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pathogenesis PAH involve multiple mechanism . However , three common factor think cause increase pulmonary vascular resistance characterize devastate disease : vasoconstriction , pulmonary vascular proliferation remodeling , thrombosis situ . Advances knowledge molecular mechanism involve PAH suggest endothelial dysfunction chronic impaired production vasoactive mediator play key role . Reduced production vasoactive mediator , nitric oxide ( NO ) prostacyclin , along prolonged overexpression vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , affect vascular tone also promote vascular remodeling . Thus , substance represent logical pharmacological target . Animal study show ET-1 could stimulate aldosterone secretion different specie , vivo vitro . This stimulation involve ET-B alone ET-A ET-B receptor subtypes rat human . Animal study also show spironolactone combine ACE inhibitor could normalize blood pressure , prevents upregulation vascular ET-1 , restore nitric oxide ( NO ) -mediated endothelial dysfunction . Beta-blockers ability reduce dp/dt pulmonary artery , well left ventricle , thus prevent damage dysfunctional endothelium . Furthermore , observe practice aforementioned therapy could lower pulmonary artery pressure patent pulmonary hypertension secondary leave ventricular dysfunction . Thus , hypothesize spironolactone combine ACE inhibitor beta-blocker ability reverse remodel pulmonary artery PAH patient .</detailed_description>
