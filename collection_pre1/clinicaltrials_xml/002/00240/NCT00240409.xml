	<brief_title>Randomized Single-blind Placebo Controlled Comparative Trial Pramipexole Bromocriptine Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial investigate efficacy safety Pramipexole patient Parkinson 's disease concomitantly treat L-DOPA double-blindmethod use Bromocriptine tablet comparators ( phase III comparative trial ) . For efficacy evaluation , two primary endpoint choose : - Totalled score accord Part III UPDRS ( motor examination ) - Totalled score accord Part II UPDRS ( activity daily live ) The safety profile study drug evaluate physical examination , blood pressure , Electrocardiogram , Laboratory test , AEs SAEs . Patients eligible trial meet inclusion exclusion criterion give inform consent randomize one two treatment group , i.e. , Pramipexole tablets Bromocriptine tablet . Patients administer study drug accord dose schedule . The treatment period last maximal 12 week ( ascend dose interval : 8 week , maintenance dose interval : 4 week longer ) . In addition , descend dose interval 1-4 week . Each patient receive 7 visit except patient drops withdrawal : visit 1 : screening visit 2 : randomization baseline visit 3-6 : ascend dose interval visit 7 : Maintenance dose interval Study Hypothesis : Primary variable total UPDRS ( Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ) part III item UPDRS part II item change baseline . The trial hypothesis demonstrate non-inferiority Bromocriptine equivalence margin ( =delta ; clinically large difference judge clinically acceptable ) 90 % power , one side two primary variable error probability 2.5 % . The equivalency margin primary variable ( total UPDRS Part III , UPDRS Part II ) determine 2.0 1.0 respectively refer result oversea pivotal study Pramipexole ( BI Trial No . 248.326 ; U96-0232 ) judge study investigator . Comparison ( ) : The primary endpoint study change total score accord Part III UPDRS ( motor examination ) total score accord Part II UPDRS ( activity daily live ) 12 week treatment study drug .</detailed_description>
