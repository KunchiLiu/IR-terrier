	<brief_summary>This research study , fund Scios , Inc. , conduct Cardiology Division Department Medicine University Rochester School Medicine Dentistry investigate potential benefit nesiritide ( brand name Natrecor ( TM ) ) improve exercise capacity patient heart failure ( HF ) . Previous study show beneficial hemodynamic neurohumoral effect nesiritide infusion therapy decompensated heart failure . Other study demonstrate increase endogenous BNP level ( normalize exercise workload ) HF patient exercise . However , trial involve measurement exercise capacity population follow BNP administration lack . This experimental prospective , non-blinded , pilot study sample size 20 patient , serve control . This study involve off-label use drug nesiritide ( indicated IV treatment NYHA Class II III patient , study enrol Class II III patient ) receive FDA approval , IND . Subjects recruit population referral Strong Memorial Hospital Heart Failure Transplantation clinical service , meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion may participate study . Enrolled study subject perform exercise VO2 max test , receive 24 hour infusion nesiritide perform second exercise VO2 max test .</brief_summary>
