	<brief_title>Study Avastin ( Bevacizumab ) Reverse Acquired Estrogen Independence Previously Hormone Responsive Metastatic Breast Ca .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single institution , open-label study design evaluate safety efficacy Avastin ( Bevacizumab ) combine endocrine agent patient estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive metastatic breast carcinoma acquire resistance least one hormonal agent . Patients treat hormonal agent use previously assume patient partial complete response ( least 6 month ) follow clear disease progression use Response Evaluation Criteria solid Tumors ( RECIST Criteria ) . Patients stable disease prolong time ( least 6 month ) also eligible enter trial . Patients interval study evaluate disease response consider eligible remain clinically stable ( i.e . stable PS , increase pain ) hormone least 6 month , sign symptoms clinical progression ( i.e . elevated tumor marker , increase bone pain , worsen performance status ) . Patients must histologically confirm measurable and/or evaluable metastatic breast cancer positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptor . Patients 8-12 week break therapy ( discontinuation hormonal therapy ) still remain eligible study long documentation disease progression determine 8-12 week break hormonal therapy . The type dose hormonal agent use trial one patient use progression . Hormonal therapy may include estrogen deprivation reagent Tamoxifen , Anastrazole , Exemestane , Letrozole , Fulvestrant . All patient receive Avastin ( Bevacizumab ) 15 mg/kg IV every three week . Based statistical evaluation , 30 patient enrol . The first evaluation efficacy do week 6 ; patient objective response stable disease continue therapy re-staging every 6 week evidence disease progression . Patients progression disease take study ( see appendix A ) . PET scan do baseline first evaluation ( 6 week ) obtain early `` metabolic response data '' correlate objective response time disease progression ( PET data week 6 used evaluate response make therapeutic decision ) . PET `` metabolic response '' define &gt; 20 % reduction SUV . Safety assess record adverse event , serious adverse event , laboratory test result , change vital sign . A positive response Avastin ( Bevacizumab ) ( reversal hormonal resistance ) define objective response stable disease â‰¥ 3 month duration . All concomitant medication must document . Additionally , diagnostic , therapeutic surgical procedure perform study period , record include date , indication , description procedure ( ) clinical finding .</detailed_description>
