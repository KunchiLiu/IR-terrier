	<brief_title>A Follow-up Study Assess Safety Tolerability Galantamine Treatment Individuals With Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dementia chronic , progressive brain disease may involve number symptom , include memory loss change personality , behavior , judgment , attention span , language thought . The common type dementia Alzheimer 's disease . Over time , patient Alzheimer 's disease may lose ability perform daily task relate personal care ( example bathing , dress , eat ) may unable handle money travel familiar place . The term mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) use describe individual memory impairment suggestive early dementia , yet meet criterion Alzheimer 's disease . Individuals MCI likely develop Alzheimer 's disease normal elderly patient . Individuals MCI complete 1 2 previous double-blind study galantamine may participate follow-up study progress dementia . They receive open-label galantamine 12 month evaluate 2 , 6 12 month treatment . Safety evaluation ( incidence adverse event , ECGs , physical examination , laboratory test ) perform throughout study . Effectiveness assess 12 month treatment ( use standardize test rating scale ( Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale : cognitive/MCI version [ ADAS-Cog/MCI ] , Clinical Dementia Rating [ CDR ] CDR-Sum Boxes [ CDR-SB ] ) . Health status assess use Health Survey portion Short-Form 36 ( SF-36 ) use health social care resource assess use resource-use questionnaire . The enrolled individual may participate optional portion study genetic material analyze see contain something would affect way galantamine use body . Galantamine 8 12 milligram ( mg ) mouth twice daily 12 month . Dose start 4 mg twice daily gradually increase final dose ; 12 mg twice daily dose may decrease 8 mg twice daily base upon tolerability</detailed_description>
