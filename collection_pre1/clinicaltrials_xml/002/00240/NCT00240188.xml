	<brief_title>A Study Compare Ventral Incisional Hernia Laparoscopic v Open Repair With Mesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The appearance ventral incisional hernia ( VIH ) follow open abdominal operation important postoperative problem . While advance anesthesia technique , good method prevent surgical infection , improve treatment infection , use new suture material reduce incidence incisional hernia , incisional hernia still occur 0.5-11 % open abdominal surgical procedure perform . Overview study design : We conduct 4 center randomize clinical trial compare outcomes two method surgical management ventral incisional hernia . Patients present physician ventral incisional hernia consider trial . The study design compare rate complication , pain , time return normal activity , Health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) patient satisfaction laparoscopic open mesh repair ventral incisional hernia . The rate recurrence hernia 1-2 year evaluate secondary outcome . Four VA medical center capability enrol 40-50 patient year select base volume , experience open laparoscopic ventral herniorrhaphy experience conduct clinical trial . Patients recruit physician site refer site coordinator screen eligibility . The trial randomize blind . The randomization scheme take consideration random allocation patient study group make within center . In addition participate center , baseline variable serve stratification factor first time recurrent ventral incisional hernia patient body mass index great less 35arm . Timeline : The trial consist 3 phase : Implementation , Patient intake follow-up , closeout final analysis . 1-Implementation ( 2 month ) : The implementation include funding , recruitment nurse coordinator review study protocol technique operation 2 month duration . 2-Patient intake follow ( 32 month ) : All study patient recruit period time . Follow-up occur simultaneously end close . The range follow-up expect range 8 week 34 month . 4-Final analysis closeout : The participating center give 2 month fund close data collection . During period , final follow-up visit data collection complete . Final analysis run concurrently closeout .</detailed_description>
