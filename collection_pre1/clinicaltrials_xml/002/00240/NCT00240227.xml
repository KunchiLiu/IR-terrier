	<detailed_description>1 . Objective project : To evaluate efficacy prazosin reduction crave alcohol cocaine dependent individual . The investigator hypothesize prazosin effective placebo reduction crave stimulate exposure visual cue intolerance stress individual dependent cocaine individual dependent alcohol . Specifically , investigator hypothesize laboratory study : - Subjects prazosin condition report reduction crave induced laboratory exposure visual cue compare subject placebo condition . - Subjects prazosin condition show le reaction noradrenergic system crave induced laboratory exposure visual cue compare subject placebo condition . - Subjects less likely relapse drug choice prazosin condition compare placebo condition . Most individual able achieve sobriety chemical dependency treatment eventually relapse . Until investigator prevent craving drug , usually precede relapse , unlikely investigator effective treatment drug addiction . Our final hypothesis alpha-1 , adrenergic antagonist , prazosin , prove effective pharmacological agent treatment drug dependency . 2 . Research plan study design : The propose study double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study prazosin subject either dependent alcohol cocaine , able achieve one month sobriety intensive outpatient treatment . The double-blind , crossover protocol last 8 week include 32 subject ; 16 alcohol-dependent , 16 cocaine-dependent . The focus first study subjective physiological measure crave induce control setting exposure visual cue . 3 . Methodology Setting : This study occur room 6A-107 Building 1 Veterans Administration Puget Sound Health Care System Seattle . This soundproof room specifically design construct study type . Participants : 16 alcohol-dependent adult 16 cocaine-dependent adult present chemical dependency treatment VA Puget Sound Health Care System ( VAPSHCS ) Addiction Treatment Center . Study Procedures : Once potential subject provide consent participate study , undergo 2 hour baseline assessment consist pencil paper questionnaire , provide medical psychiatric history , physical exam . They provide blood basic screen labs insure healthy enough proceed study , baseline vital sign measure . Veterans screen study enrol lab result screen process determine meet medical exclusion criterion . At point , participant randomize either study medication placebo . During course study , participant continue outpatient chemical dependency treatment Addiction Treatment Center VA Puget Sound . During eight week study , participant weekly orthostatic vital sign adverse event monitor study nurse physician . All serious unexpected adverse event report FDA UW Human Subjects Committee accordance requirement . Participants also provide self-reports drug alcohol use urine drug analysis specimens weekly visit . At end week 4 , participant test 1 hour crave session room 6A-107 VA Puget Sound . Subjects heart rate skin conductance response continuously measure , blood pressure measure every 5 minute . They show 5 1-minute film , 3 design neutral 2 design provoke crave drug choice . They ask complete subjective scale crave prior video last video . Participants permit leave craving lab last film , feel subjectively return level normal physiological arousal longer experience crave . 4 . Findings : No finding date .</detailed_description>
