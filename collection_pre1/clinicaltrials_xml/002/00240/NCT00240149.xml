	<brief_summary>Recent study adult intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient show significantly decrease morbidity mortality blood sugar concentration closely control . The safety efficacy type blood sugar management study pediatric ICU population . Based current pediatric literature data well extensive retrospective study , blood sugar concentration potentially profound role play among PICU patient . In preparation multi-center randomize control trial , propose prospective feasibility study evaluate safety effectiveness use insulin delivery algorithm manage blood sugar PICU . Our hypothesis feasibility trial uniformly monitoring control blood glucose Discrete-Closed-Loop ( DCL ) insulin delivery algorithm effective , safe , consistent mean deliver insulin manage glucose pediatric intensive care unit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) demonstrate long-term microvascular complication hyperglycemia could reduce adolescent adult intensive diabetes management.1 Hyperglycemia also show acute risk factor poor outcome variety adult case include trauma , cardiac,2 surgical , stroke , head injury patient . Moreover , control hyperglycemia improve outcome critically ill adult patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) setting . In prospective randomized study , Van den Berghe et al . report 1,548 patient admit adult surgical ICU . During admission , intensive treatment intravenous insulin control hyperglycemia diabetic non-diabetics reduce risk death 42 % , overall in-hospital mortality 34 % , sepsis 46 % , acute renal failure 41 % .3 Utilizing less stringent criterion glycemic control , Finney et al . also report similar findings.4 While study emphasize value control hyperglycemia adult ICU , relatively study evaluate incidence hyperglycemia , correlate , PICU , interventional study . 5,6 Because limited pediatric data available impressive finding display adult literature , perform retrospective chart review pediatric patient admit PICU 13 month period . The goal study gain good understand current glucose monitoring technique PICU well hyperglycemia correlate morbidity mortality pediatrics . The result confirm hypothesis high peak glucose admission associate longer LOS high mortality rate . 7 As demonstrate adult , control hyperglycemia potential profound impact morbidity mortality patient PICU . Our preliminary study clearly show hyperglycemia associate increase LOS mortality . Unfortunately , true clinical impact control hyperglycemia pediatric ICU patient know . By accurately safely control hyperglycemia PICU , opportunity improve standard care well potentially improve overall clinical outcome PICU patient . Once use insulin delivery algorithm method glucose monitoring explore randomize control feasibility study , form improve glucose management formally test large multi-center trial PICU setting .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>: Patients 118 year age admit PICU LPCH ask participate randomize feasibility trial hospitalization . This initial age restriction adjust experience gain . Patient display evidence hyperglycemia ( &gt; 150mg/dl ) Initially , patient young 5 year age exclude . These patient appear high sensitivity insulin well propose high risk hypoglycemia . Since feasibility trial use insulin control glucose , feel would prudent establish success old patient population extend study include young child infant . In addition , PICU study reveal significant increase risk hyperglycemia base age . This age restriction adjust midstudy data analysis . Patients know pregnant exclude . Patients know platelet dysfunction exclude . Patients without intact , uninfected skin future site sensor insertion . Study patient readmitted PICU hospital discharge eligible repeat participation</criteria>
