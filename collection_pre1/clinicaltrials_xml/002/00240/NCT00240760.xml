	<brief_summary>This study ass whether memantine effective safe prevent age relate cognitive deterioration dementia people Down 's syndrome ( DS ) age 40 . The study last year include 180 people Down 's syndrome without dementia . Participants assess memory skill , attention problem solve ability . Quality life ability everyday live skill also regularly check . Primary Aims Clinical : - To determine clinical efficacy memantine versus placebo prevent cognitive decline people DS . - To compare safety tolerability memantine versus placebo people Down ’ syndrome ( DS ) . Biochemical pathological : - To examine ability memantine alter marker disease progression DS patient . Secondary Aims Clinical : - To determine whether memantine , compare placebo , significant positive impact : - level independent functioning measure carer-rated adaptive behavioural scale , ( ABS ) adult DS ; - quality life adult DS . Biochemical pathological : - To investigate putative marker memantine ’ mechanism action peripheral sample live patient DS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over age 40 , people Down ’ Syndrome substantial change brain similar Alzheimer ’ disease high risk develop clinical dementia progressive decline function cognitive ability . There change key chemical messenger system brain people develop Alzheimer ’ disease . One ubiquitous chemical messenger system , present majority nerve cell brain , call glutamatergic system . In system main receptor present nerve ending refer glutamate receptor . Under certain circumstance , usually damage particular part brain , receptor lead “ overfiring ” nerve cell disastrous consequence . This result generation number toxic chemical molecule lead damage nerve cell ( phopholipases , protease , nitric oxide synthases , inflammatory molecule free radical ) , usually refer excitotoxicity . Memantine block effect pathologically elevate tonic level glutamate may lead dysfunction nerve cell way think block main glutamate excitotoxicity site nerve cell . Randomized clinical trial people Alzheimer ’ disease indicate memantine significantly slow progression functional cognitive impairment . Memantine license treatment moderate-severe Alzheimer ’ disease basis trial . We would hypothesise old people Down ’ syndrome would particularly benefit treatment Memantine , partly large amount Alzheimer ’ disease change present brain partly excessive glutamate receptor activity demonstrate adult Down ’ syndrome . In recent study assess 122 individual Down ’ Syndrome use newly develop neuropsychometric battery test , ( Down 's syndrome Attention , Memory Executive function battery -DAME battery , Margallo-Lana 2002a , b ) . People Down ’ Syndrome age 40 without dementia experience decline 11 % one year , indicate progressive cognitive decline precedes dementia ( hence offering important opportunity prevention ) measurement sensitive cognitive change time , hence trial evaluate prevention dementia feasible current evaluation measure . Study Design : Participants give Memantine placebo ( dummy tablet ) 52 week . To avoid bias , participant allocate placebo Memantine group random ( randomized trial ) none researcher participant know treatment people get ( study double blind ) . However , emergency , investigator contact study pharmacist find whether particular participant receive Memantine dummy tablet . The placebo Memantine group compare end study ( study placebo control ) see Memantine good dummy pill . The efficacy Memantine assess compare change score initial assessment assessment follow-up period 12 , 26 52 week . Thus participant assess 4 occasion . Assessments : In addition clinical history collection standardize information adverse event , assessment include : 1 . Assessment memory , attention planning ability : Memory , attention executive function ( plan ability ) assess direct testing participant use DAME battery . The DAME battery validate measure sensitive change old people Down ’ syndrome . The range score 0-241 complete 45 minute people mild-moderate learn disability . The test re-test inter-rater reliability XX YY respectively . 2 . Development dementia : To facilitate diagnosis dementia , use Dementia Questionnaire mentally Retarded Persons ( DMR ) . This standardise , validate reliable tool specifically develop aid assessment dementia people mild moderate learning disability . It informant-based questionnaire consist 50 item complete family staff patient know . Items arrange 8 subscales : short term memory ; long-term memory ; spatial temporal orientation ; speech ; practical skill ; mood ; activity interest ; behaviour disturbance . The range score 0-104 complete 15-20 minute . The inter-rater reliability 0.76 . 3 . Diagnosis dementia : Standardized criterion diagnosis dementia base International Classification Diseases , 10th Version ( ICD 10 ) use 2 expert ( Dr Margallo-Lana , Dr Prasher ) identify new case . The assessment dementia do baseline , week 26 week 52 assessment . The diagnosis dementia base clinical information supply carers aid use Dementia Questionnaire Persons Mental Retardation ( DMR ) . 4 . Independent functioning : Independent functioning evaluate use Adaptive Behavioural Scale ( ABS , Nihira,1974 ) . This informant base instrument part assessment use American Association Mental Deficiency ( Nihira , 1974 ) ass daily living skill people learn disability . The ABS measure ten group skill related self-care socialization . The ten skill group : independent functioning , physical development , economic activity , language development , number time , domestic activity , vocational activity , self-direction , responsibility , socialization . The ABS test-retest reliability .96 , good . Score range 0-280 . 5 . Quality life : Quality life evaluate Quality Life Alzheimer 's Disease ( Logsdon et al . 1998 ) . This scale specifically developed measure quality life people dementia . It compose 13-items measure physical condition , mood , memory , functional ability , interpersonal relationship , ability participate meaningful activity , financial situation , global assessment self whole QOL whole . The response option 4-point multiple choice option ( 1 = poor , 4 = excellent ) . Scale score range 13 52 , high score indicate great QOL . 6 . Global change : The Clinician ’ Global Impression Change ( CGI/C ) one commonly used test ass overall change clinical trial ( Guy , 1976 ) . The validity type measure base ability experienced clinician detect clinically relevant trivial change patient ’ overall clinical state . These simple scale show remarkably sensitive change cholinesterase inhibitor trial ( Schneider , 1997 ) . 7 . Standardized schedule monitor side effects/adverse event . Participants : 180 people age &gt; 40 DS ( without dementia ) mild-moderate learn disability , double blind , placebo control design . Related Biochemical Studies : Blood sample ( 10ml ) take baseline final follow-up assessment . Blood process yield four different component : plasma , platelet , red white blood cell . Plasma concentration amino acid neurotransmitter aspartate glutamate measure together rate uptake glutamate blood cell ( platelet ) . The ability glutamate bind platelet ' receptor ( particularly NMDA receptor - sub-type glutamate receptor ) also also assess . These investigation determine whether Memantine protect modulate glutamatergic transmission . Plasma concentration amyloid ( Abeta species 1-40/1-42 ) , protein typically accumulate brain people Alzheimer 's disease , also measure together plasma concentration amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) . Preliminary study also undertake see glutamate receptor platelet ( NMDA receptor ) regulate release APP/Abeta . The study also investigate genetic factor may affect risk Alzheimer 's disease people Down 's Syndrome . Any identified genetic factor examine see predict response treatment . These investigation help determine Memantine alters accumulation protein brain typical Alzheimer 's disease people Down 's syndrome . Consumers panel relative people DS carers involve protocol development write information sheet .</detailed_description>
