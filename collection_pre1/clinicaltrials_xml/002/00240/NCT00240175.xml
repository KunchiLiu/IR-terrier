	<brief_summary>Foot orthotics shoe insert currently utilized common conservative treatment option wide variety foot disorder . This treatment use relatively healthy active population sedentary population diabetes peripheral vascular disease ( dysvascular ) . However , limited objective scientific data document actual benefit effectiveness either customize over-the-counter foot orthoses . It aim study determine effect three popular foot orthotics plantar pressure diabetic population . If foot orthoses utilized preventive treatment option reduce risk foot ulceration redistribute plantar pressure , orthoses would cost effective solution high cost ( mental fiscal ) medical impairment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It estimate 17 million people affected diabetes 8 million remain undiagnosed United States alone . Of total diabetic population , approximately 15 % develop foot ulceration 6 % continue onto manner foot lower limb amputation . While widely recommend therapeutic shoe foot orthotics utilized ongoing care diabetic insensate foot , limited scientific literature quantify actual effect . If early use orthotic device able decrease risk delay onset foot ulceration , could essential treatment strategy individual diabetes peripheral vascular . To evaluate orthotic device repeat measure within subject study design purpose . There forty two diabetic subject rat Category 1 UTHSCSA Podiatry Scale ( Peripheral neuropathy , history ulceration ) . Each subject receive three set foot orthotics pair extra-depth athletic shoe . The subject receive wear orthotics randomize order . The orthotics test vary material morphology . They custom mold trilaminar insert , prefabricate trilaminar insert without modification , over-the-counter contour shoe insert Plastazote polyurethane . Plantar pressure measurement acquire baseline four week accommodation set foot orthoses . It anticipate participant 's involvement study require five month . This study help determine efficacy three different type foot orthotics help establish good guideline health care practitioner regard optimal foot care diabetes assist collect data future grant .</detailed_description>
