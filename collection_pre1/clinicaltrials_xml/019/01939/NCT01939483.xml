	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Irinotecan Patients With Breast Cancer CNS Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ; I . To evaluate safety efficacy irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) breast cancer patient brain metastasis progress radiation therapy . II . To estimate central nervous system ( CNS ) objective response clinical benefit rate patient breast cancer brain metastasis treat irinotecan . III . To estimate progression free survival . IV . To estimate overall survival . V. To assess toxicity Irinotecan . OUTLINE : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 24 month .</detailed_description>
