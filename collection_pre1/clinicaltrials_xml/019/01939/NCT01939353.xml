	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 exploratory study conduct evaluate efficacy safety EB-1020 SR treat adult male patient meet DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criterion ADHD M.I.N.I.-Plus . Evaluations include determine effectiveness signal ADHD relate symptom explore dosing , tolerability , onset action , duration effect .

	<brief_title>An Exploratory , Single-Blind Pilot Study Of Flexible Doses Triple Reuptake Inhibitor EB-1020 SR Treatment Adult Males With Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , flexible-dosage , single-blind study consist Screening Phase ( 28 day [ Visit 1 ] ) , 5-week Treatment Phase ( 1 week treatment placebo [ Baseline-1/Visit 2 Baseline-2/Visit 3 ] follow 4 week treatment EB-1020 SR [ Weeks 1 4/Visits 4 7 ] ) , 2-week Discontinuation Phase , start time Week 4/Visit 7 include Follow-up Visit ( Week 6/Visit 7 ) . Approximately 40 patient planned enter treatment period . At Baseline-1 , patient must score great equal 28 ADHD-RS-IV eligible continue participation study . At end single-blind placebo treatment ( i.e. , Baseline-2 ) , ADHD-RS-IV adult prompt re-administered . Patients show improvement great equal 30 % baseline value score less 28 ADHD-RS-IV withdrawn study prior receive active drug . Those show le 30 % improvement Baseline-1 Baseline-2 score continue study . The consent form phrase patient inform exact time EB-1020 SR vs. placebo treatment order maintain blind nature placebo treatment reduce potential placebo effect . Dosing flexible , target maximum dosage 500 mg daily divide dos ( morning afternoon , approximately 5 hour later ) achieve possible Week 2 EB-1020 SR treatment . The patient take start dose 100 mg EB-1020 SR daily ; dose titrate 100 mg increment maximum dosage 500 mg daily . The treat physician escalate dose maximum dose patient achieve remission ADHD his/her judgment , EB-1020 SR still well tolerate . If physician 's judgment patient could tolerate dose escalation , tolerate current dose well , dose may maintain reduce , goal re-assessing dose response subsequent visit possible increase dose , study completion .</detailed_description>
