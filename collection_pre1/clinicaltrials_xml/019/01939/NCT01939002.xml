	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine proportion participant relapse multiple sclerosis experience new and/or increase flu-like symptom ( FLS ) transition nonpegylated IFN-β therapy peginterferon beta-1a ( BIIB017 ) . Secondary objective : determine severity frequency ( measure flu-like symptom score [ FLS-S ] ) FLS participant ; determine duration ( measure number hour ) FLS participant ; determine effect BIIB017 participant-reported outcome , include treatment satisfaction ( measure Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Medication [ TSQM ] ) disability status ( measure Patient Determined Disease Steps [ PDDS ] ) 56-week period ; determine whether interferon-related FLS result miss day work/daily activity ( e.g. , absenteeism ) ; ass use additional medication ( addition current medication use treat FLS ) relieve BIIB017-related FLS ; determine incidence adverse event throughout study period ; characterize immunogenicity profile participant switch prior IFN-β therapy BIIB017 .</brief_summary>
