	<brief_summary>This single-center , open-label , single arm study explore whether potential image biomarkers correlate efficacy bevacizumab combine conventional therapy newly diagnose glioblastoma . Despite increase therapy available , median survival patient glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) remain less 15 month . The phase III pivotal study newly diagnose GBM also meet co-primary endpoint progression-free survival ( PFS ) confirm efficacy bevacizumab GBM . Early predict efficacy bevacizumab combine conventional therapy newly diagnose glioblastoma could help u identify suitable patient receive suitable treatment GBM . Thus , characterize blood flow blood volume tumor change therapy might provide information vasculature growth collapse , edema formation , tumor growth , and/or cell death ( necrosis ) .We decide investigate whether estimation blood circulation tumor , use MRI , PET could use surrogate marker predict early response GBM bevacizumab . Several previous study demonstrate relative cerebral blood volume ( rCBV ) correlate histologic grade glioma investigate prognostic value tumor CBV survival.In current study , We hypothesize , temporal change anti-angiogenesis therapy specific region high low perfusion glioblastoma might predict efficacy bevacizumab.Since mature PET tracer directly image Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) China , use 18F-Galacto-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD ) —— new tracer PET image αvβ3 test Standardized uptake value mean ( SUVmean ) , Standardized uptake value max ( SUVmax ) tumor non-tumor tissue ratio ( T/NT ) indirectly reflect VEGF expression . The integrin αvβ3 important receptor affect tumor growth , local invasiveness , metastatic potential . Specifically , αvβ3 highly express activate endothelial cell angiogenesis . Therefore , pilot study , use dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) , dynamic susceptibility-contrast magnetic resonance imaging ( DSC-MRI ) 18F-Galacto-RGD PET explore potential image biomarkers bevacizumab use newly diagnose glioblastoma .</brief_summary>
