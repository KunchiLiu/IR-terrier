	<brief_title>Metabolic Clock Genes During Fasting After Food Intake Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most metabolic function control metabolic clock gene regulate glucose , lipid metabolism several circadian metabolic pathway involve insulin resistance obesity type 2 diabetes . The main group clock gene resides SCN nuclei synchronize light/dark signal . However similar clock oscillator call peripheral clock find almost tissue , include liver , heart , kidney , intestine , skeletal muscle , adipocytes peripheral blood cell ( PBC ) . The peripheral clock , specially metabolic clock gene , seem control mainly food cue . The time food intake synchronize simultaneously parallel way almost peripheral metabolic clock gene include expressed peripheral blood cell ( PBC ) i.e . leucocyte , monocyte ; allow explore oscillation metabolic clock gene expression whole body assess expression PBC . Impaired oscillation metabolic clock gene mRNA expression find diabetic animal model patient type 2 diabetes inversely correlate HbA1c . In support finding report high calorie breakfast reduce dinner improved insulin sensitivity weight loss rate among obese subject , type 2 diabetic patient high calorie breakfast associated improvement HbA1c . Moreover , recently show short time ( 120 min ) food intake breakfast , sufficient reset expression circadian clock gene . This study undertake explore whether compare extension overnight fast lunch versus breakfast consumption influence oscillation metabolic clock gene expression peripheral blood cell ( PBC ) , noon isocaloric lunch type 2 diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
