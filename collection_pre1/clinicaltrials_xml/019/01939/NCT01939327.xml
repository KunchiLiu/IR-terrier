	<brief_summary>The incidence non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) steadily increase worldwide . At present , sixth commonly diagnosed cancer France , 10 000 estimate new case 5200 death annually . An increase NHL incidence rate 3-4 % per year observe 1970s 1980s . This stabilize 1990s , nevertheless still annual rise 1-2 % , result almost double NHL incidence last 40 year . This rise note worldwide , particularly elderly person &gt; 55 year . Increases high-grade NHL extranodal disease predominant . There 80 % B-cell histology , approximately 90 % follicular lymphomas 70 % aggressive lymphoma patient present disseminated disease diagnosis . The prognosis NHL depend histological type , stage treatment . Indolent lymphoma relatively good prognosis survival time long 10 year , usually incurable advanced stage . Aggressive NHL constitute 50 % case NHL Western Europe . Approximately 50 - 60 % patient cure immuno-chemotherapy regiment . Subsequently , almost 50 % patient eventually relapse become refractory treatment . The prognosis patient refractory relapse aggressive NHL generally poor . The response rate salvage therapy regimen range 20 40 % . Patients present refractory disease bad prognosis , median survival less six month . Only minority patient give high dose chemotherapy , majority ineligible due disease progression . By modulate immune system dendritic cell NK cell , change cytokine milieu , anti-angiogenic effect , IMiDs combination mabthera ( rituximab ) result augmented vitro vivo antitumor effect B-cell lymphoma . As concern time administration dos medication , phase I/II study ongoing R-CHOP combination Revlimid ( Lenalidomide ) DLBCL . The late presentation Nowakowski et al . ASCO meeting June 2010 . This study determine maximum tolerate dose Revlimid ( Lenalidomide ) administer day 1-10 standard R-CHOP ( R2-CHOP ) . NO DLT find 25 mg Revlimid ( Lenalidomide ) recommend dose phase II enrollment 32 patient . These encouraging result permit introduce much less toxic protocol 25 mg Revlimid ( Lenalidomide ) initial dose , progressive reduction case toxicity . As regard dose time Mabthera ( Rituximab ) , DLBCL traditionally use single 375 mg/m2 injection/cycle . Pre-clinical data suggest optimal NK enhancement Revlimid ( Lenalidomide ) must administrate several day ( approx . 7 day ) Mabthera ( Rituximab ) injection . So , protocol provide Mabthera ( Rituximab ) IV administration day 7 Revlimid ( Lenalidomide ) . Performed parallel biological investigation NK status permit confirm hypothesis possible correction time number administration Mabthera ( Rituximab ) par cycle .</brief_summary>
