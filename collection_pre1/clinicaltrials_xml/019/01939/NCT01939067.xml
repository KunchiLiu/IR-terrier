	<brief_title>Infant Pulmonary Mechanics : High Flow Nasal Cannula Versus Nasal CPAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory distress need respiratory support continue common problem preterm infant . Presence breathe tube duration respirator provide breath show associate increase risk secondary lung injury subsequent development chronic lung disease prematurity . Early application noninvasive nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( NCPAP ) show effective , non-invasive , mode respiratory support preterm infant associate low incidence chronic lung disease . A recently publish large randomize multicenter study conclude , among infant bear 28 week long gestation , heat humidified high flow nasal cannula ( HHHFNC ) similar clinical efficacy safety compare NCPAP . Both NCPAP HHHFNC currently use assist infant breathe problem . This study design evaluate effect HHHFNC compare NCPAP lung function measure lung injury preterm infant bear 28 37 week gestation require continue respiratory support . In study , infant remain assigned treatment either NCPAP HHHFNC require support provide respirator treatment cross-over NCPAP HHHFNC , reverse , decide attend physician . The infant 's respiratory support manage accord his/her attend doctor per accept standard care . A pulmonary function test perform twice weekly enrol infant receive either NCPAP HHHFNC support , followed-up weekly lung function measurement post respiratory support infant breathe room air discharge .</detailed_description>
