	<detailed_description>After complete transurethral resection primary high risk non-muscle invasive bladder tumor ( stage pTa , pT1 , carcinoma situ high grade urothelial carcinoma ) , patient induction course intravesical BCG low urinary tract symptom unresponsive standard therapy enrol . The patient supply write informed consent document describe investigational nature protocol . Induction treatment consist initial 6 intravesical BCG treatment weekly interval commence approximately 3 week transurethral resection procedure . The BCG instillation consist 81 mg wet weight ( 10•2±9•0 x 108 colony-forming unit ) BCG Connaught substrain . Lyophilised ( ie , freeze-dried ) BCG suspend 50 mL bacteriostatic-free solution 0•9 % sodium chloride . After drain bladder , suspension infuse intravesically Foley catheter . The solution retain bladder 120 min , follow empty bladder removal catheter . During BCG treatment patient persistent low urinary tract symptom unresponsive standard therapy ( anticholinergic , alpha-blocker , antibiotic , analgesic anti-inflammatory drug ) treat intravesical instillation 50 ml sterile Baobab natural oil ( Baotrophic , Physion Srl , Mirandola , Italy ) . After drain bladder , suspension infuse intravesically Foley catheter . The solution retain bladder 60 min , follow empty bladder removal catheter . Lower urinary tract symptom self-recorded patient baobab oil instillation classify investigator accord classification grid consider account duration intensity . The classification symptom class 0= none , class I = mild , class II = moderate , class III = severe , accord severity .
