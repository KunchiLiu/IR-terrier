	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study copper Cu 64 ( 64Cu ) tetra-azacyclododecanetetra-acetic acid ( DOTA ) -trastuzumab positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) study patient gastric , stomach cancer . Diagnostic procedure , copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab PET/CT , may help doctor study characteristic tumor choose best treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>64Cu DOTA-Trastuzumab PET/CT Studying Patients With Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare tumor uptake 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab ( copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab ) gastric cancer patient pathologic evaluation tumor human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) /neu expression . II . To compare copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab-PET-CT scan standard radiographic image stag patient gastric cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 undergo PET/CT scan day 2 3 . After completion study , patient follow 15 day periodically 6 month .</detailed_description>
