	<detailed_description>Dietary fiber consist mainly carbohydrate digest human small intestine . A high intake dietary fiber associate many health benefit include , limited , improved bowel function reduce risk weight gain , cardiovascular disease diabetes . Therefore , great interest food industry produce product enrich dietary fiber promote health . One way achieve use whole grain ( wheat , rice , oat , barley ) ingredient product breakfast cereal , bread food bar . However , use whole grain result product different taste and/or texture usual product make refined grain . Thus , type high-fiber ingredient develop incorporate food product less effect taste and/or texture . Examples ingredient inulin ( oligosaccharide contain fructose ) resistant starch . Resistant starch , define starch digest human small intestine , present small amount ( 2-5 % total starch ) many normal food . Starch abundant energy contain nutrient human diet ; consist 2 type polysaccharide : amylose , linear polymer consist long chain glucose molecule join 1-4 linkage ; amylopectin , highly branch polymer consist long chain glucose molecule join 1-4 linkage numerous 1-6 linkage branch point . Most ( 70-80 % ) starch normal starchy food ( eg . cereal potato ) amylopectin . Amylopectin highly digestible branched structure make readily able gelatinize , process whereby adjacent starch molecule swell separate influence moist heat ( ie . cooking ) . By contrast amylose less digestible linear structure allow adjacent molecule associate hydrogen bonding reduces ability gelatinize . Some type commercially available resistant starch come strain corn produce starch contain 70 100 % amylose . The digestibility starch usually determine in-vitro use method involve digestion starch α-amylase pH temperature condition think mimick digestion human small intestine . However , evidence method may overestimate amount resistant starch much 100 % . Methods used estimate starch digestibility in-vivo include breath hydrogen method measurement amount carbohydrate ileal effluent subject ileostomy . The latter consider best in-vivo method involve preparation subject polysaccharide-free diet day consumption test carbohydrate breakfast . Subjects collect ileal effluent day time consume polysaccharide-free diet . There evidence resistant starch consume breakfast completely recover ileal effluent 8-10hr consumption . The objective study determine amount carbohydrates 3 commercially available starch ( Hi-Maize® 260 , Hylon® VII Amioca corn starch ) escape digestion human small intestine .</detailed_description>
