	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomized trial compare outcome Prontosan versus normal saline solution negative pressure wound therapy instillation ( NWPTi ) . Negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) well establish method treatment acute chronic wound . The combination negative pressure instillation solution relatively novel concept gain popularity currently use nationally internationally . NPWTi standard care division . Despite grow use , limited information regard selection ideal instillation solution . This single site , investigator initiate , NPWTi study compare use Prontosan normal saline adjunctive treatment acutely infect wound require hospital admission . A total 100 subject include 50 subject treatment arm . The outcome measure 1 ) number operation , 2 ) length hospital stay , 3 ) % wound close prior discharge , 4 ) time closure prior discharge , 5 ) % remain closed 30 day follow-up , 6 ) reduction qualitative bacterial culture . The result study good characterize appropriate use NPWTi .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Outcomes Prontosan Versus Normal Saline Negative Pressure Wound Therapy With Instillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overview This prospective , randomize , comparative trial examine 2 different instillation solution NPWTi . All wound type meet eligibility criterion enrol study . After enrollment , subject randomize either Prontosan NPWTi group ( n=50 ) normal saline NPWTi group ( n=50 ) . Data collect inpatient hospital record . Outline Study Procedures 1 . Patients meet eligibility criterion require hospital admission infect wound identify . Demographic information obtain . 2 . Informed consent obtain . 3 . Subjects take operate room wound debridement within 72 hour admission per standard care ( SOC ) . Further , antibiotic therapy medical management perform per SOC . 4 . Randomization Prontosan normal saline instillation group conduct informed consent sign , first operation . 5 . For first operating room visit follow conduct : 1 . Pre- post debridement qualitative culture 2 . Debridement perform SOC fashion 3 . Post debridement measurement 4 . Application NPWTi 6 . For subsequent operating room visit follow conduct : a. Pre- post debridement qualitative culture b. Debridement perform SOC fashion c. Post debridement measurement d. Application NPWTi closure . The decision close wound determine clinician per SOC . ii . The technique utilized closure determine clinician per SOC . 7 . Subjects discharge hospital . Criteria discharge per judgment investigator per SOC 8 . After hospital discharge , subject follow outpatient wound clinic per SOC . Information one month follow-up period collect . Subjects exit study point . Subject Recruitment No active recruitment strategy employ . Patients meet eligibility criterion approach participate study . Participation Completion Discontinuation : Subjects may elect discontinue participation time reason . Investigators may elect remove subject participate time reason . Surgical Technique : Surgical debridement perform SOC manner discretion investigator . Postoperative Care : Will conduct customary SOC fashion discretion investigator . The 30 day follow-up visit part SOC Application Devices/Dressing : The device utilize V.A.C . Ulta Veraflo Technology ( Kinetic Concepts Inc. , San Antonio , TX ) . This FDA approve device indicate wound care . The investigator currently use device SOC inpatient management acutely infect wound . The device consist foam sponge apply wound surface adhesive drape keep place . This device apply subatmospheric pressure -125mmHg wind surface . The instillation component include delivery topical solution prescribe fashion wound surface . This solution dwell ( negative pressure interval ) sponge specific duration evacuate . Negative Pressure Wound Therapy : The set negative pressure -125mmHg , continuous setting , moderate intensity . The application foam drape conduct customary fashion . The negative pressure duration 2 hour . Prontosan : Prontosan ( B Braun , Bethlehem , PA ) 0.1 % polyhexanide , 0.1 % betaine , sodium hydroxide , purified water . The polyhexanide antiseptic betaine surfactant . This solution FDA approve device indicate topical irrigation . This solution high tolerability robust antimicrobial activity . Polyhexanide utilized instillation solution NPWTi positive clinical result . Prontosan currently use instillation solution NPWTi facility SOC . The dwell set solution 20 minute . The volume solution use dependent size wound hence varies . Normal Saline : Normal saline ( 0.9 % NaCl ) isotonic solution widely use intravenous application also use SOC wound irrigation . This solution high tolerability . Normal saline use instillation solution NPWTi . The dwell set solution 20 minute . The volume solution use dependent size wound hence varies .</detailed_description>
