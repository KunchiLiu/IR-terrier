	<brief_summary>Artemisinin combination therapy ( ACT ) artemether lumefantrine ( AL ) currently first line treatment policy Kenya . AL efficacious drug also capacity reduce malaria transmission mosquito . Nevertheless , concern development parasite resistance AL . Clinical trial Asia show mefloquine-artesunate ( MQ-AS ) may efficacious AL may pronounce beneficial effect post-treatment malaria transmission . MQ-AS register used Kenya report direct comparison AL MQ-AS clinical transmission endpoint ( i.e . adequately clear parasite prevent transmission mosquito ) . Screening molecular marker relate parasite susceptibility ACT drug post-ACT treatment malaria transmission assist strategy prevent development spread ACT resistance . In current study , compare AL MQ-AS treatment uncomplicated malaria . Our endpoint ) clinical efficacy , ii ) post-treatment gametocytaemia molecular technique . In current study , investigator compare AL MQ-AS treatment uncomplicated malaria . The investigator endpoints clinical efficacy post-treatment gametocytaemia molecular technique</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Efficacy Malaria TRANSmission After Artemisinin Combination Therapy 2 ( TRANSACT2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accurate diagnosis follow prompt efficacious treatment backbone malaria control programme . However , malaria treatment face huge challenge recent year . A number affordable antimalarial drug use cure malaria since 1940s : include chloroquine ( CQ ) , sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ; Fansidar® ) , mefloquine ( MQ ) , amodiaquine ( AQ ) quinine . The emergence spread resistance commonly-used drug largely responsible worsen malaria situation observe past decade . Across African continent , guideline recently change . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend falciparum malaria use combination therapy , preferably contain artemisinin derivative ( ACT , artemisinin-based combination therapy ) . Artemisinin derivative , e.g . artesunate , artemether dihydroartemisinin , extremely potent antimalarial agent ideal partner combination antimalarial . ACTs three demonstrable advantage conventional therapy , ) efficacious clear asexual parasite , ii ) substantially reduce post-treatment gametocyte carriage iii ) `` protect '' partner drug select resistant parasite . In Kenya , CQ SP lose clinical efficacy . CQ replace SP 1998 year 2006 , SP effectively replace Artemether-Lumefantrine ( AL : Coartem® ) . The policy change artemisinin-based drug AL line WHO recommendations shift ACT first line antimalarial treatment.The efficacious ACT , however , need local comparison term treatment efficacy transmission-reducing activity .</detailed_description>
