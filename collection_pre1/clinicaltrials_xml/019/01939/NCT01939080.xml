	<brief_summary>Many condition cardiovascular disease ( include stroke ) well manage regular exercise training . The expected effect partial reversal adverse effect heart blood vessel structure function , improve glycemic , tension weight control . Physiologically , aorta maintains low leave ventricular after-load , promote optimal sub-endocardial coronary blood flow , transforms pulsatile laminar blood flow . Increased aortic stiffness may ultimately contribute leave ventricular dysfunction . Regular exercise training likely decrease pulse wave velocity ( measure aortic compliance ) . Some subject seem responsive others , may expect benefit exercise training . To best knowledge , explain yet .</brief_summary>
