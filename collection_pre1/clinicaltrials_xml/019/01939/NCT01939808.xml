	<brief_summary>Hand flexor tendon bend finger towards palm , cut sharp penetrating injury ( e.g . knife saw ) . Damaged flexor tendon repair surgically suture ( stitch ) . After repair , splint apply finger , hand wrist six twelve week protect repair tendon heals regains normal strength . Most rehabilitation protocol use splint wrist position keep straight ( neutral ) bent ( flex ) . Some group describe splint wrist cock back ( extend ) make argument may improve outcome , experimental data suggest splint hand wrist extend increase range movement repair flexor tendon ( excursion ) , therefore reduces chance tendon stick surround tissue ( adhesion ) . Previous study show adverse effect splint hand wrist extend , evidence tell u wrist splint position well ( state clinical equipoise apparently equivalent outcome ) . This randomised trial aim produce evidence , therefore improve functional outcome patient future . We propose carry study compare outcome ( grip strength range movement ) flexor tendon repair two group patient : one wrist splint neutral position splint extended position postoperative rehabilitation . No change make patient assessment management , surgery undertaken rehabilitation regime splint position . Previous work suggest position safe effective . Informed consent obtain patient enrolled trial , aim find extend splint position produce good functional result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Primary inclusion criterion study patient 100 % division sharp laceration Flexor Digitorum Profundus ( FDP+ ) /Flexor Digitorum Superficialis ( FDS ) within zone I II undergone repair cruciate epitendinous suture . Patients multiple digit involvement include study . All repair perform 3/0 prolene suture cruciate repair 6/0 prolene epitendinous repair per departmental protocol . Patients digital nerve repair along injury include study Patients associate phalangeal fracture , skin soft tissue loss vascular compromise exclude study . Patients tendon repair cruciate exclude study</criteria>
