	<brief_title>IMAGE Study : Personalized Molecular Profiling Cancer Treatment Johns Hopkins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal research study determine possible obtain personalized genetic information subject 's tumor see physician use information make treatment suggestion . The investigator hope identify gene important cancer cell could potentially identify educated way recommend therapy . It known suggestion treatment base genetic information correct treatment choice . Subjects treat doctor choice treatment receive decide treat suggestion study . In case possible make suggestion . For example , suggestion treatment possible technical issue , gene sequence process take longer plan , gene identify could help identify treatment suggestion . The investigator also plan collect information treatment subject receive cancer respond treatment . This may help u understand personalize suggestion improve amount time disease progress . In addition , blood sample collect research study . These sample collect learn breast cancer study cell , gene , gene product include pattern change blood tissue help learn cancer develop respond therapy . Any man woman see Johns Hopkins treatment metastatic triple negative ( behave triple negative ) breast cancer may eligible . Upon conclusion tissue study order gain experience assess feasibility receive blood-based result use blood sample kit , enroll additional cohort patient recent Foundation Medicine test clinical purpose collect blood sample research test . The primary objective analysis new cohort proceed similarly original tissue-based cohort .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>MOLECULAR PROFILING IN TISSUE : Male Female 18 year age old Metastatic breast cancer treatment prior chemotherapy ( either adjuvant , neoadjuvant metastatic setting ) Triple negative clinical phenotype ( ER , PR , HER2 ) . For HER2 assessment , negative result immunohistochemical ( IHC stain 0 1+ , FISH result le 4.0 HER2 gene copy per nucleus , FISH ratio less 1.8 . ER/PR assess IHC define positive/negative use American Society Clinical Oncology/College American Pathologists ( ASCOCAP ) Guidelines . Estrogen receptor ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PR ) assay consider positive least 1 % positive tumor nuclei sample test presence expect reactivity internal ( normal epithelial element ) external control . NOTE : A triple negative clinical phenotype base upon patient 's clinical course may also eligible determined discretion Study Chair ( ie , patient behave clinically ER/PR negative meet strict criterion outline . ) Patients must tumor suitable biopsy deem medically appropriate undergo biopsy Able voluntarily provide informed consent MOLECULAR PROFILING IN BLOOD : Male Female 18 year age old Metastatic breast cancer Any phenotype breast cancer eligible enrollment ( i.e. , ER , PR , HER2 status ) . Able voluntarily provide informed consent</criteria>
