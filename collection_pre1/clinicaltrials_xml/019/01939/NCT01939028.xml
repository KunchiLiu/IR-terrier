	<brief_title>Lymph Node Mapping Patients With Newly Diagnosed Endometrial Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine detection rate , sensitivity , negative predictive value sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) biopsy endometrial cancer patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare different surgical modality ( open procedure , minimally invasive procedure , single-site technology ) different injectant ( isosulfan blue indocyanine green ) SLN biopsy . II . To determine total operate room time ( time patient enters room time patient leaf room ) well console time ( robotic ) /operating time minimally invasive procedure . OUTLINE : Patients undergo SLN map use isosulfan blue and/or indocyanine green solution inject directly cervix . Following SLN identification biopsy , patient undergo hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , and/or complete pelvic lymphadenectomy . Patients express SLN positive metastasis undergo para-aortic lymphadenectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2-4 week .</detailed_description>
