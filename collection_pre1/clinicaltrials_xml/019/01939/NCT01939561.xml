	<brief_summary>Myotonia functional limiting symptom muscle stiffen action lead arrest movement . Pharmacological treatment may make difference physically restrict normal life . Today , patient myotonia treat Mexiletine medication result adverse event 40 % expensive difficult obtain . Our clinic , force problem related Mexiletine , treat patient drug Lamotrigine pronounce positive effect . Lamotrigine belong category drug Mexiletine few milder side effect . Based similarity 2 drug pharmacological action positive experience investigator convince Lamotrigine show positive effect evaluate broad scale . Due advantage Lamotrigine compare Mexiletine investigator find outmost importance patient drug assess formally establish Lamotrigine treatment choice myotonia . Investigators believe potentially make huge difference life quality person myotonia . Investigators aim investigate efficacy tolerability Lamotrigine treatment myotonia randomize doublet blind placebo control crossover study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order document Lamotrigine effective treatment myotonia investigator choose 20-weeks double-blind randomize placebo-controlled cross-over design . Participants randomize receive either Lamotrigine placebo first period ( 8 week ) opposite second period ( 8 week ) . Between two period , drug free period minimum two week include ensure participant receive Lamotrigine first period , longer affected drug begin second period . Participants schedule six evaluation clinic , three period . At evaluation , degree myotonia determine blood sample take analyzed , study closure , determine Lamotrigine level . Before evaluation participant evaluate myotonia home Myotonia Behavior Scale ( MBS ) . Furthermore , participant complete validate life quality questionnaire SF-36 , first period , drug free period , second period . Treatment : Participants treat escalate dosage ( 25/50/150/300 mg ) Lamotrigine/placebo daily two period eight week . Patients prior study receive treatment , drug potentially influence myotonia , must stop treatment study . Participants , experience severe myotonia define MBS , allow use escape medicine ( Mexiletine ) 60 hour evaluation . Any use Mexiletine note assessed part efficacy estimation . If Mexiletine take 60 hour evaluation blood concentration Mexiletine measure , exclude data blood concentration therapeutic level . Disadvantage , Side effect Safety : During study participant take usual medication myotonia . This cause symptoms myotonia , nuisance patient 's everyday life . Side effect Lamotrigine treatment usually mild . The common headache skin rash ( 2 ) . All event inconvenience register side effect report Health Authorities accordance current regulation . The study stop suspicion previously unknown side effect Lamotrigine impact participant 's life feasibility .</detailed_description>
