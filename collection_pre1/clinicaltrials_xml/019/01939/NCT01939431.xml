	<brief_summary>Background : - Podoconiosis disease lymph vessel legs foot . It cause long-term barefoot exposure irritant soil , volcanic area . It cause severe swell disfigurement , well infection chronic pain . It mostly affect people live tropical Africa , Central South America , India . The reason people develop disease others well understood . Researchers want study people disease healthy volunteer Ethiopia . They collect skin blood sample study genetic aspect disease . Objectives : - To collect skin blood sample study genetic aspect podoconiosis . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age podoconiosis ( early stage advanced stage ) . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . - Participants recruit study clinic hospital Ethiopia . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Blood sample collect . A skin biopsy perform collect tissue study . People podoconiosis provide affect unaffected tissue . Healthy volunteer provide single skin biopsy sample . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research protocol design study gene expression differential immunologic profile histopatologic presentation podoconiosis compare case control Ethiopia . Podoconiosis geochemical lymphedema lower limb result long term barefoot exposure irritant red clay soil volcanic origin . The disease impose huge social economic burden affect 4 million individual tropical Africa , Central South America , North India . The pathologic change podoconiosis still know histopathologic feature disease well study . Our recent genome-wide association study reveal variant HLA class II gene ( HLA-DRB1 , -DQB1 , -DQA1 ) associate podoconiosis , suggest disease may Tcell mediated inflammatory condition ( New Eng J Med 2012 ) . The objective present study investigate immunologic profile gene expression difference podoconiosis patient healthy control . The study include 150 subject consist 100 case ( 50 early stage 50 advanced stage ) , 50 control Ethiopia . Anonymized discard skin tissue sample obtain excised nodule 50 advanced stage patient undergo nodulectomy ( surgical excision nodule ) Bahir Dar Hospital . Punch biopsy obtain affected skin tissue ( epidermis dermis ) 50 early stage podoconiosis patient attend routine treatment Dur-Bete Podoconiosis Center , normal skin tissue ( epidermis dermis ) 50 control subject undergo orthopedic surgery lower leg Bahir Dar Hospital . We also obtain 6 mm skin tissue punch biopsy unaffected area low limbs podoconiosis patient peripheral blood sample ( PBS ) study subject . RNA PBS T cell separate cell extract Armauer Hansen Research Institute Ethiopia ( AHRI ) ship along skin biopsy keep liquid nitrogen CRGGH/NHGRI . We use RNA-seq , high throughput RNA sequence technology , characterize transcriptome sequence complementary DNAs ( cDNAs ) follow map sequence read genome . Generation double-stranded cDNA mRNA quantitation cDNA concentration do lab NIH . Sequencing do commercial high throughput sequence company , SeqWright ( Houston , TX ) Illumina certify service provider . Immunologic profile do use FACSCalibur type flow cytometry . Analysis data do use appropriate statistical program pipeline suit describe . This study expect reveal differential gene expression podoconiosis patient control . Furthermore , chart evolution gene expression signature podoconiosis patient different clinical stage disease . The finding could potentially lead biomarkers complement clinical genetic characteristic disease . The histopathological study provide rich description cutaneous immunologic response across spectrum disease . The integration clinical , immunological , genetic , cellular molecular characteristic disease facilitate development model natural history pathogenesis neglect tropical disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All individual include study adult ( great equal 18 year ) average age onset disease third decade life . In addition , Ethiopia legal age give independent consent research 18 year old . Previous study show diagnosis podoconiosis use physical diagnostic criterion endemic highland area highly accurate . To rule filarial elephantiasis , rapid ICT card test do . Advanced stage podoconiosis case include study base prior assessment experience surgeon ( Dr Wendemagegn Enbiale Yeshanehe ) assure eligibility nodulectomy patient clinical stage III , IV V podoconiosis fibrotic nodule . Early clinical stage podoconiosis patient individual negative filarial test clinical stage I II . Controls individual past current history , sign symptoms podoconiosis family history podoconiosis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : In addition clinical criterion make patient control noneligible undergo surgery , also exclude individual skin infection , skin lesion prospective biopsy site , medical contradiction biopsy , history adenolymphangitis previous 2 week , topical steroid treatment previous 2 week , biologically relate family member include study , recent infection , use systemic antibiotic use systemic steroid . Attempts make enroll equal number men woman . No prisoner , pregnant woman fetus include study .</criteria>
