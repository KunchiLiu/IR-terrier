	<brief_summary>Robot-assisted training ( RT ) device develop date significant impact stroke rehabilitation . Several research group develop robotic device examine efficacy improve UL function stroke . All robotic device apply stroke rehabilitation efficacy evaluate , scientific evidence mechanisms RT-induced recovery , relative treatment effect unilateral vs bilateral robotic training , impact physiological response still lack . The primary purpose study examine ( 1 ) relative immediate treatment effect unilateral vs bilateral RT motor impairments/performance daily function patient subacute stroke ; ( 2 ) long-term benefit unilateral vs bilateral RT conduct 6-month follow evaluation ; ( 3 ) effect RT movement reorganization well physiological marker inflammation , oxidative stress , erythrocyte deformability , blood glucose . These overall finding help well understand efficacy RT functional outcome , movement reorganization , physiological marker . The investigator would additionally explore possible differential treatment effect patient different level motor severity ( i.e. , moderate vs. severe ) . The investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) unilateral ( InMotion3 ) bilateral ( Bi-Manu-Track ) robot-assisted training would bring large benefit motor performance daily function control treatment ; ( 2 ) benefit would retain follow-up ; ( 3 ) would differential immediate retention effect unilateral ( InMotion3 ) bilateral ( Bi-Manu-Track ) robot-assisted training different outcome measure ; ( 4 ) well movement reorganization well physiological marker expression would find robotic group compare control group ; ( 5 ) would differential effect robotic therapy participant moderate vs. severe motor impairment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Unilateral Versus Bilateral Approach Robot-Assisted Rehabilitation Patients With Subacute Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subacute stroke participant recruit Chang Gung Memorial Hospital randomly assign 1 3 group : RT InMotion3 ( unilateral ) robot group , RT Bi-Manu-Track ( bilateral ) robot group , conventional intervention group . Assessments motor impairments/performance ( Fugl Mayer Assessment , Modified Ashworth Scale , MyotonePRO , Medical Research Council scale , Jamar dynamometer , Action Research Arm Test ) daily function ( Motor Activity Log , ABILHAND Questionnaire , accelerometer , Adelaide Activities Profile ) take 40 minute complete . Kinematic evaluation take 1 hour . Blood sample patient ( 12 ml . ) collect examine physiological marker ( ie , inflammation-related marker , oxidative stress marker , erythrocyte deformability , blood glucose ) intervention . A total 24 ml blood collect study . Except blood taking , examination non-invasive . Analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , control pretest difference , separately perform outcome measure test effect different intervention group .</detailed_description>
