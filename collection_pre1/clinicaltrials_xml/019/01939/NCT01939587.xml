	<brief_summary>This single-center , double-blind , randomize trial utilize three-period , balanced block design , period comprise unique study product administration . The treatment study PBF-680 5 mg , PBF-680 20 mg placebo , orally administer capsule . The study include screen visit , selection visit , three visit randomize treatment sequence , end-of-study follow-up visit , span 65-day maximum study duration . The study conduct 18 male female adult age ³18 year , diagnosis stable , mild moderate asthma per GINA guideline , smoke less 5 packs-years smoke history history , responsive AMP airway challenge determine selection visit . The primary efficacy variable PC20 yield AMP airway challenge test three treatment visit . FeNO , sample three time point treatment period visit , exploratory variable . Safety assessment include monitor adverse event , physical examination , vital sign , EKGs , spirometry , serum urine pregnancy test , laboratory determination . Blood sample time-point series provide pharmacokinetics data . The primary variable study PC20 , mg×mL-1 . The PC 20 distribution analyze treatment use ANOVA repeat measurement , follow post hoc pairwise comparison appropriate . Other analysis comprise FeNO , pharmacokinetics , data set generate baseline characteristic safety assessment , discretionary expiratory analysis evaluate influence baseline clinical covariates primary variable .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female adult age 18 , sign informed consent form prior initiation study procedure . Subjects mild moderate asthma , diagnose per Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA ) guideline . Subjects must body mass index 18 35 kg/m² . Subjects must able perform acceptable spirometry accordance ATS/ERS criterion acceptability repeatability . Subjects must baseline FEV1 60 % predict normal , great 1 L absolute value , Visit 2 . On Visit 2 , eligible subject must show airway hyperresponsiveness AMP , determine PC20 thresholding ( AMP provocative concentration elicit 20 % drop baseline FEV1 value , AMP challenge test per ERS Task Force Indirect Airway Challenges ) . Current smoker , smoker within six month prior Visit 1 , subject smoke history great 5 packyears . Asthmatics treatment Step 5 per GINA guideline , include oral corticosteroid and/or omalizumab , immunosuppressive medication whether asthmarelated indicated concomitant morbidity . Subjects history lifethreatening asthma attack ( i.e . require ICU admission , orotracheal intubation ) . Subjects history respiratory tract infection asthma crisis require use antibiotic and/or systemic corticosteroid within 4 week prior Visit 1 , develop respiratory tract infection asthma crisis screen period . In latter case , subject rescreened four week last dose systemic corticosteroid antibiotic . Subjects receive bronchial thermoplastic treatment . Subjects concomitant pulmonary thoracic disease asthma could interfere safety efficacy per site investigator assessment . This include , limited , COPD attributable tobacco alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency , cystic fibrosis , sarcoidosis , interstitial lung disease , pulmonary hypertension , active pulmonary tuberculosis , prior condition lead pulmonary resection surgery lung transplantation . Noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis without clinically significant morbidity , moderate alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency without evidence emphysema relate COPD , past pulmonary tuberculosis receive proper medical treatment , acceptable provide condition expect interfere pulmonary function test per site investigator assessment . Subjects symptoms angina pectoris history confirm coronary disease cardiomyopathy . Subjects AV block degree , sinus bradycardia , tachyarrhythmia , unstable atrial fibrillation , long QT syndrome , QTc ( F ) interval great 450 m screening ( Visit 2 ) , EKG abnormality deem clinically significant investigator . Subjects clinically significant laboratory abnormality screening ( Visit 2 ) . Subjects current uncontrolled arterial hypertension . Women childbearing potential , unless surgically sterile ( i.e . bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , complete hysterectomy ) , least 2 year postmenopausal , practice abstinence , agree employ effective contraception Visit 1 Visit 6 . Acceptable contraception procedure oral , transdermal , implanted contraceptive , intrauterine device , female condom spermicide , diaphragm spermicide , use condom spermicide sexual partner . Women supply lactation . Receipt investigational drug therapy biologicals within 3 month randomization study , within 5 halflives investigational agent biologic , whichever longer . History known immunodeficiency disorder . Subjects history malignancy within past five year , exception localize basal cell carcinoma skin . History treatment alcohol drug abuse within past year . Subjects comorbidity could affect safety efficacy per site investigator assessment .</criteria>
