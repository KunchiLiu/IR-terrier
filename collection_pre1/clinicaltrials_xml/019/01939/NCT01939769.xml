	<brief_summary>Background : - Research show one exercise session may improve person ability recall information learn exercise . Knowing exercise change brain activity improve memory help researcher understand memory work improve people memory problem . This study compare two kind exercise stationary bike ability temporarily improve memory certain test . Researchers look effect exercise body chemistry draw blood collect saliva . Objectives : - To understand single session exercise affect memory test healthy people people traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 45 TBI . - Healthy adult volunteer , age 18 45 . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . This take 1 hour . - Participants TBI also screen test memory . This take another hour . - Visit 1 take 3 hour . Participants : &lt; TAB &gt; - Have tube insert arm drawing blood test . &lt; TAB &gt; - Take memory test . They look picture , symbol , word , answer question . &lt; TAB &gt; - Give saliva sample chew small sponge 2 minute . &lt; TAB &gt; - Exercise stationary bike . &lt; TAB &gt; - Take memory test . - Visit 2 take place 1 week later . Participants take memory test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The goal study 1. replicate finding exercise exposure image enhances subsequent recall , 2. extend question word logical rule , 3. examine mechanism effect use exercise biomarkers fMRI 4. explore usefulness aid memory individual traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Study population : Healthy adult volunteer individual TBI . Design : The main , clinical , experiment parallel , repeated-measures design , four group ( two healthy subject participant TBI ) encode picture , word rule exercise either high low ( placebo ) intensity . Recall test one hour seven day exercise . Blood saliva collect immediately exercise assayed biomarkers exercise , think possible mediator memory effect . In parallel-design fMRI experiment , intend explore brain basis effect exercise memory , healthy volunteer view picture , exercise high low intensity , perform recall task scanner . The analysis look difference location extent evoke brain activation evoke picture recall low high intensity exercise . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure recall visual material one hour exercise . Secondary measure recall word list letter/digit symbol matching ( logical memory ) activation fMRI . The blood saliva biomarkers include exploratory outcome .</detailed_description>
