	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To determine rate downstaging resectability patient borderline resectable pancreatic cancer receive FOLFIRINOX SBRT preoperative therapy . Secondary Objective ( ) : 1 . To assess disease-free-survival , overall survival , time recurrence site recurrence patient borderline resectable pancreatic cancer receive preoperative FOLFIRINOX follow SBRT 2 . To investigate safety tolerability FOLFIRINOX SBRT patient resectable pancreatic cancer 3 . To determine radiologic pathological response associate preoperative SBRT FOLFIRINOX therapy 4 . To assess quality life treatment use FACT-Hep questionnaire</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Borderline Pancreas Study : FOLFIRINOX +SBRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study investigator hypothesize neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX safely efficaciously deliver use sequential regimen SBRT alternative standard neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Standard care neoadjuvant treatment typically require six week treatment sub-systemic dosing chemotherapy . The feasibility sequential delivery FOLFIRINOX follow SBRT evaluate capture prevalence grade 3 toxicity treatment delay rate . In study , SBRT plan sequentially follow cycle 4 chemotherapy treatment , provide toxicity resolve grade 2 less . Thus , allow resolution chemotherapy toxicity prior initiation radiation therapy . This interval fact concurrent delivery chemo-RT , base previously discuss experience , include approach SBRT safely follow intense chemotherapy regimen ( see Polistina et al Chuong [ 35,36 ] ) make study feasible without establish toxicity profile . The propose regimen 4 cycle FOLFIRINOX follow 30 Gy/5 fraction use SBRT safely tolerate improve resectability rate borderline resectable PDAC patient . In addition , regimen compromise ability achieve successful Whipple resection . This regimen improve local control rate overall disease free survival patient population . The investigator hypothesize early administration FOLFIRNOX provide optimal systemic therapy control clinically occult micrometastases .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>≥ 18 year diagnosis . Biopsy proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Borderline resectable per NCCN criterion ( No distant metastases , venous involvement portal vein/SMV , demonstrate tumor abutment narrow lumen , encasement portal vein/SMV without encasement nearby artery , shortsegment venous occlusion result either tumor thrombus encasement suitable vessel proximal distal area vessel involvement , allow safe resection reconstruction ; gastroduodenal artery encasement hepatic artery either short segment encasement direct abutment hepatic artery , without extension celiac axis ; tumor abutment SMA exceed 180 degree circumference vessel wall. ) . Radiologically measurable clinically evaluable disease . Pancreas protocol CT and/or MRI require clarification disease tissue plane within 4 week registration . ECOG PS 02 . Able get Whipple resection per surgeon assessment perform within 4 week registration . The following laboratory value obtain ≤ 28 day prior registration : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mm3 . Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 . Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dL . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . SGOT ( AST ) ≤ 2 x ULN . SGPT ( ALT ) ≤ 2 x ULN . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN . CA 199 level ( establish baseline ) . A negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior registration woman childbearing potential . In addition , male female participant must commit adequate contraception study . Able provide write informed consent . Willing return require study assessment . Neurological assessment preexist peripheral neuropathy . Documentation preexist hear deficit . Any pancreatic adenocarcinoma meet criterion borderline resectable disease . Prior history abdominal radiation therapy . History autoimmune disease scleroderma , lupus , inflammatory bowel disease . Patients tumorcaused symptomatic bowel obstruction . Chemotherapy ( include hormonal therapy ) within past 5 year date registration . Other invasive malignancy within past 5 year date registration . Pregnant nursing woman woman childbearing age unwilling employ adequate contraception . Other comorbid condition , base judgment physician obtain informed consent , would make patient inappropriate study .</criteria>
