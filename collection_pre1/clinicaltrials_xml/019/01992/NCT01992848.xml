	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) remain leading cause mortality UK estimate 80,000 fatality 2010 . Coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) associate atherosclerotic plaque burden cardiovascular mortality . Mechanisms underlie isolated CAC yet fully explain . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) , know act regulator gene expression , also emerge powerful biomarkers diagnosis prognosis cardiovascular disorder may use detection CAC . We aim investigate potential `` microRNA-signature '' patient CAC perform prospective , case-controlled study identify pathway associate CAC human . Previous research demonstrate inverse relationship CAC bone mineral density ( BMD ) , suggest process may link . In substudy plan define relationship CAC BMD well number marker bone metabolism .</brief_summary>
