	<brief_summary>This two stage study , initial dose escalation phase I study subsequent double blind randomise phase II control trial . Eligible patient post-menopausal woman metastatic ER+ breast cancer suitable surgical resection . Patients suitable endocrine treatment , receive 3 previous line endocrine treatment 1 line chemotherapy metastatic disease . They also progressive disease treatment aromatase inhibitor . Following dose-escalation stage 1 , patient randomise receive fulvestrant plus either placebo 480mg ( maximum tolerate dose ) AZD5363 oral capsule tablet take daily . Patients receive fulvestrant combination either placebo AZD5363 disease progression . Patients may continue receive fulvestrant AZD5363/placebo treatment even last trial visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase 1 ( n=9-12 ) As fulvestrant AZD5363 previously administer population , incorporate initial phase I dose escalation : - 3 patient receive fulvestrant 500mg day 1 400mg AZD5363 oral capsule tablet bd 4 day 3 day . They assess dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) day 1 , 15 28 cycle 1 . The safety review committee ( SRC ) meet review DLT report third patient finish cycle 1 . - If 400mg tolerable ( 0/3-6 1-6 DLT ) dose AZD5363 escalate 480mg . - If 480mg tolerable cohort 6 patient 480mg Maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . - If 480mg tolerable ( 2/6 patient DLT ) , 400mg dose MTD . - If 400mg tolerable ( 2 patient DLT ) dose reduce 320mg next cohort 6 patient . - 320mg tolerable cohort 6 patient , 320mg MTD . - 320mg tolerable , trial proceed . If patient withdraw reason toxicity Stage 1 DLT assessment replace . Phase 2 ( n=136 ) Recruitment Phase 2 commence 6 patient Stage 1 complete least 1 cycle therapy SRC give go-ahead . Patients randomise one two arm : Arm A ( control arm ) : Fulvestrant + placebo The control arm consist continuous 28 day cycle fulvestrant 500mg day 1 , plus placebo capsule tablet bd 4 day 3 day . Arm B ( experimental arm ) : Fulvestrant + AZD5363 The experimental arm consist continuous 28 day cycle fulvestrant 500mg day 1 , plus AZD5363 capsule tablet bd 4 day 3 day . A safety assessment make 20 patient randomise receive AZD5363 placebo least 1 cycle protocol treatment stage 2 . Phase 2 3 stage , want investigate whether tumour certain characteristic likely respond AZD5363 . As mentioned , test tumour tissue presence PIK3CA mutation ( gene encode catalytic subunit class 1 PI3K ) low level phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) . Laboratory research show tumour characteristic may respond good AZD5363 . Tumours characteristic call wild-type , want make sure n't recruit many patient might benefit treatment . We start recruit eligible patient . However , know 40 patient wild-type tumour , trial treatment eight week , stop recruit patient wild-type tumour . This mean blood test confirm tumour PIK3CA mutation patient enter onto study . We perform review tumour measurement wild-type group determine whether tumour patient receive AZD5363 shrunk patient receive placebo . If evidence tumour shrunk AZD5363 group compare placebo , recruit patient wild-type tumour . If evidence tumour shrink AZD5363 group , start recruit patient wild-type tumour .</detailed_description>
