	<brief_title>Extension Study XLHED-Affected Male Subjects Treated With EDI200 Protocol ECP-002</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia ( XLHED ) disorder ectoderm development sweat secretory gland hypoplasia predispose affect infant serious potentially life-threatening hyperthermia pneumonia . Those XLHED patient survive infancy face host ectoderm-related clinical condition include failure thrive , oligodontia misshapen teeth , mid-face hypoplasia , eczema , chronic dry eye , asthma , respiratory infection , sinusitis chronic nosebleed . XLHED cause inherited defect ectodysplasin gene ( EDA , www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim ) result deficiency ectoderm signal protein EDA-A1 . As general case X-linked disorder , hemizygous XLHED male consistently severely affected , heterozygous XLHED female variable phenotype . In normal development , EDA-A1 act ectoderm signal molecule bind specifically EDA-A1 receptor ( EDAR ) trigger initiation maturation ectodermal appendage sweat secretory gland , tooth buds hair follicle . In case XLHED , EDA-A1 deficiency result absence functional hypoplasia ectoderm appendage . There therapy currently available XLHED prevent correct underlie ectodermal abnormality . EDI200 fully humanize EDA-A1 replacement molecule development novel therapeutic XLHED . EDI200 comprise human IgG1 Fc domain link human EDA-A1 receptor-binding domain . On-target EDI200 activation EDA-A1/EDAR signal pathway vivo evidence remarkable phenotypic response preclinical model . In XLHED-affected animal , EDA-A1 deficiency correct single course EDI200 therapy , administer either prenatally ( mouse ) postnatally ( newborn mouse dog ) , result significant sustain improvement health treat animal . Postnatal study mice dog demonstrate consistent restrict window efficacy . These result support clinical development EDI200 therapeutic administer XLHED-affected patient neonatal period earlier . ECP-002 , Phase 2 , international , first-in-neonate EDI200 study enrol treatment-na√Øve , XLHED-affected male newborn first two week life . All subject meet entry criterion include documentation EDA mutation associate XLHED . Following Baseline evaluation , EDI200 dose initiate day-of-life 2 14 , study subject receive single course study drug administer 2 doses/week total 5 dos . The treatment study protocol incorporate comprehensive safety , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , immunogenetic , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) /efficacy evaluation continue age 6 month . The goal ECP-002e extension study continue evaluation EDI200-treated ECP-002 subject age 10 yr . No additional study drug administration plan . The efficacy evaluation incorporate growth development parameter , frequency infection hospitalization , age-appropriate assessment ectoderm-derived organ function . The safety evaluation include physical examination , adverse event concomitant medication documentation , laboratory testing .</detailed_description>
