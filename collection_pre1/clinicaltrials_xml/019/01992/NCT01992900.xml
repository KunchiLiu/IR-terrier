	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Study Eurartesim Dispersible Formulation Infants With P.Falciparum Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although significant advance make last decade control malaria Africa , morbidity mortality sub-Saharan country remain substantial . It estimate around 655.000 death year still occur due malaria infection majority death occur among young African child . In response emergence spread classical drug-resistant Plasmodia strain , WHO recommend since 2004 use artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) treatment uncomplicated malaria episode . The artemisinin derivative currently rapidly act potent antimalarial drug . Eurartesim fixed-dose combination product compose dihydroartemisinin ( DHA ) piperaquine phosphate ( PQP ) . This second compound assure long-term efficacy eurartesim complete whole body clean parasite . Eurartesim appear offer benefit exist license malaria treatment line current WHO treatment policy recommendation . Eurartesim obtain centralized marketing authorization European Union film coat tablet contain 160 mg PQP/20 mg DHA 320 mg PQP/40 mg DHA . The drug , license use child ( 6 month age ) adult administer infant ( 6 month ) young child crush tablet administer small amount water . According Guidelines Clinical Investigation Medicinal Products Paediatric Population ( EMA ICH Topic E 11 ) , need paediatric formulation permit accurate dosing enhance patient compliance . However , treatment malaria , scarce paediatric-friendly formulation available market , particularly blatant problem young child carry brunt malaria burden . Thus , new water dispersible formulation eurartesim develop oral administration , since liquid formulation may need desirable paediatric patient small age due inability swallow tablet . Moreover , order increase paediatric compliance treatment , new formulation prepare acceptable flavour sweetener child . Eurartesim promise effective ACT treatment malaria . It provide simple dose scheme ( single daily dose 3 day ) need concomitant administration food improve absorption . Moreover , eurartesim offer interest post-treatment prophylactic effect follow therapy , reduce risk new infection , issue particular relevance highly endemic malaria country .</detailed_description>
