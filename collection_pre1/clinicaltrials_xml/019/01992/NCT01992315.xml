	<brief_summary>Soft tissue injury lead significant deformity size , shape body contour . Adipose tissue , continue tissue choice repair soft tissue defect due traumatic defect . Current autologous fat transfer technique , however , number limitation include significant donor site morbidity , unpredictable resorption , potential require revision . Thus , `` off-the-shelf '' material retain mechanical biological property adipose tissue would ideal reconstruction . Extracellular matrix ( ECM ) -based biomaterials potential non-immunogenic biological scaffold adipose tissue engineering repair soft tissue defect . Our collaborator recently generate novel tissue-derived material improve soft tissue reconstruction . The final , process adipose tissue contain cellular component , yet retain native architecture bioactivity original adipose tissue . The tissue process particle create injectable implant . In preclinical model , demonstrate human adipose tissue decellularized mechanical processing preservation matrix ultrastructure . Histologic analysis two-weeks implantation rat show minimal inflammatory reaction good tissue integration decellularized , dilipidized , adipose derived-ECM . The goal study 1 ) evaluate safety compatibility soft tissue implant , 2 ) determine efficacy ECM replacement soft tissue injury 6 week . Specifically , volume soft tissue defect determine implantation multiple time point follow 6 week . We hypothesize decellularized adipose ECM retain least 50 % volume surface area 6 week . If result promise , decellularized adipose derived-ECM may viable alternative autologous tissue transplantation correction soft tissue deformity .</brief_summary>
