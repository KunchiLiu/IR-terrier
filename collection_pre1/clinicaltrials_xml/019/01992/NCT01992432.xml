	<detailed_description>Breast cancer lead cancer diagnose among woman US second lead cause cancer death . Adjuvant chemotherapy proven decrease risk relapse mortality breast cancer . However , old adult increase risk chemotherapy toxicity , include increase risk treatment-related mortality . At present , preliminary evidence regard brain structure function affect chemotherapy toxicity breast cancer patient . However , prior research specifically study old woman . Thus , need establish sensitive test reproducible biomarkers , identify old breast cancer patient high risk chemotherapy toxicity Our long term goal identify highly sensitive reproducible brain MRI biomarkers associate chemotherapy toxicity age cancer patient . Toward goal , objective study define change occur brain MRI determine relationship brain MRI change chemotherapy toxicity old adult breast cancer . We aim 1 ) define structural functional change occur brain MRI old woman breast cancer receive adjuvant chemotherapy ; 2 ) determine relationship severity structural functional change brain MRI chemotherapy toxicity . We expect severity structural functional change brain MRI patient correlate severity chemotherapy toxicity . The propose study significant focus unknown relationship brain MRI change chemotherapy toxicity old woman breast cancer . It innovative proposes advance MRI technique study identify novel potential biomarkers chemotherapy toxicity old adult breast cancer . It positive impact help clarify underlying pathophysiology cognitive decline cause chemotherapy toxicity . The data generate pilot study also help serve foundation future large scale study cognition chemotherapy old adult .</detailed_description>
