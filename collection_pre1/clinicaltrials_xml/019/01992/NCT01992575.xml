	<brief_summary>Retinal blood vessel disease encompass wide variety vision-threatening condition . Of condition , retinal vein occlusion common . Vision loss occur result macular ischemia ( loss blood flow macula ) macular edema ( fluid build-up macula ) . OCT image technology perform non-contact cross-sectional image retinal choroidal tissue structure real time . It similar ultrasound imaging , except OCT measure intensity reflect light rather sound wave . The purpose study see non-invasive OCT technology change due retinal vein occlusion well invasive fluorescein angiography , require injection dye vein arm patient . The study also compare map blood vessel ( angiography ) loss blood flow ( ischemia ) fluorescein angiography OCT . These study evaluate see relate vision loss .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis branch central retinal vein occlusion Inability give inform consent Inability complete study test within 30 day period date enrollment Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant A prior history reaction fluorescein dye . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , subject become eligible . Systemic antiVEGF proVEGF treatment within 4 month prior treatment . Women childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 12 month due unknown safety fluorescein angiography . Prior PRP focal laser would alter macular perfusion retinovascular feature . Inability maintain fixation OCT imaging . Other ocular condition present , opinion investigator , may alter retinal perfusion . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , might affect alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , cataract ) . Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) . Media opacity otherwise would prevent either fixation ability obtain adequate image determine examiner . History major ocular surgery ( include vitrectomy , cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within 4 month prior enrollment .</criteria>
