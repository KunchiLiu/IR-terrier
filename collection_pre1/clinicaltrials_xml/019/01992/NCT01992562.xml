	<brief_summary>This phase 4 study conduct Ohio State University Department Neurology Multiple Sclerosis Research Program . The purpose study administer single shot intrathecal ( injection space surround spinal cord via lumbar puncture spinal tap ) ziconotide test dose patient chronic painful myelopathy ( pain spinal cord damage ) painful peripheral neuropathy ( pain nerve damage ) respond pain medicine . Study Hypothesis : We intend determine single shot trial ( SST ) intrathecal ( IT ) ziconotide temporarily reduce pain patient . In proposed study , patient receive two injection , one ziconotide one placebo . They blind know order receive treatment versus placebo . The result clinical trial provide focus examination ziconotide efficacy safety patient painful neuropathy myelopathies effectively treat pain medication . Moreover , use single shot trial ( SST ) IT injection outpatient set provide evidence application technique outpatient neurological clinical practice , thereby improve access specific patient population . Ziconotide currently FDA approve indication route administration . Therefore , study design improve feasibility ziconotide trialing specifically neurology clinic ( , single shot administration ) use order ensure broad use neurologist routinely care neuropathy myelopathy patient . Information study also inform future study predictor long term efficacy pump placement .</brief_summary>
