	<brief_title>Outcomes Following Neuropsychological Intervention Acquired Brain Injury Outpatients With Executive Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Executive function ( EF ) higher-order cognitive process use particularly novel complex condition ( Shallice , 1990 ) comprise various ability include devise goal , elucidate alternative solution , implement goal-directed behavior , self-monitoring , behavior modification perseverance ( Snyder , Nussbaum , &amp; Robins , 2009 ) . According Sohlberg Mateer ( 2001 ; p.234 ) , EF may describe cognitive ability `` require complete goal-directed [ behavior ] overlearned , automatic , routine . '' As result , executive dysfunction impair one 's ability function independently ( Bolognani et al. , 2007 ) . Research identify positive relationship functional ability EF ( Hanks , Rapport , Millis , &amp; Deshpande , 1999 ) . Additionally , differential decline EF observe normal age age 60 year ( Treitz , Heyder , &amp; Daum , 2007 ) . As well , profile cognitive impairment Parkinson 's disease mark predominance executive dysfunction , follow memory deficit ( Emre , 2003 ; Emre , 2004 ; Verbaan et al , 2007 ) . In addition traumatic acquire brain injury , executive dysfunction functional deficit observe individual psychiatric illness ADHD ( Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ; e.g. , Willcutt , Doyle , Nigg , Faraone , &amp; Pennington , 2005 ) , psychostimulant opioid abuse ( e.g. , Verdejo-Garcıa , Lopez-Torrecillas , Aguilar de Arcos , &amp; Perez-Garcıa , 2005 ; Fernández-Serranoa , Pérez-García , &amp; Verdejo-García , 2011 ) , bipolar disorder ( e.g. , Frangou , Donaldson , Hadjulis , Landay , &amp; Goldstein , 2005 ; Maalouf et al. , 2010 ) , geriatric depression ( Lockwood , Alexopoulos , van Gorp , 2002 ) . The prominence executive dysfunction individual acquire brain injury mental illness , associate cost healthcare system , highlight role cognitive rehabilitation . Cognitive rehabilitation refers intervention aim enhance support cognitive ability follow brain injury , emphasis achieve functional change . It structure , goal-oriented , collaborative process therapist patient ( , possible , caregivers/family ) inform medical neuropsychological data ( Sohlberg &amp; Mateer , 2001 ) . A recent meta-analysis effectiveness cognitive rehabilitation follow acquire brain injury reveal significant effect global cognitive functioning , time-since-injury act moderate variable . Attention train follow traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) language visuospatial training aphasia identify effective treatment ( Rohling , Faust , Beverly , &amp; Damaskis , 2009 ) . In review intervention approach executive dysfunction , Boelen , Spikman , Fasotti ( 2011 ) describe three approach use previous study . First , compensatory strategy emphasize teach patient cognitive strategy offset cognitive deficit . Second , restorative strategy aim repair cognitive function . Third , behavioral therapy intervention seek modify behavior mean token economy . An example compensatory approach executive dysfunction Goal Management Training ( GMT ) . GMT cognitive rehabilitation strategy base Duncan 's ( 1986 ) theory goal neglect result disorganized behavior follow frontal lobe injury . It emphasize strategy self-monitoring self-evaluation everyday life , include pausing , identify task hand , outline goal list required step , complete task , evaluate successful completion task . Given relationship disorganize behavior functional dependence , use GMT patient executive dysfunction highly relevant . Levine et al . ( 2000 ) compare effectiveness GMT motor skill training ( MST ) patient TBI live independently community . The GMT group exhibit improved performance paper pencil task ( e.g. , proofread ) slow speed task completion suggest increased attention task demand . Improvements MST train task note MST group . Fish colleague ( 2007 ) evaluate effect `` content-free '' cue strategy ( i.e. , text message read STOP ! ) , first stage GMT , compensate goal-neglect follow brain injury . The author report significant improvement goal-directed behavior addition `` content free '' cue conclude provision cue improve goal management increase self-monitoring . GMT also evaluate normal aging , give relationship reduce executive functioning , functional difficulty , age . Van Hooren colleague ( 2007 ) evaluate 69 Dutch adult age 55 year old impact structure 12-session GMT program cognitive functioning , self-reported mood , self-reported cognitive complaint failure . Their GMT program include psychoeducation regard cognitive functioning functional difficulty study design utilized randomized wait-list control group . The result reveal reduced annoyance , improved management cognitive failure , decrease anxiety treatment group , relative control . No improvement objective measure cognitive functioning note . In another wait-list control study evaluate GMT normal aging , Levine colleague ( 2007 ) report decreased self-report executive failure improve performance simulate real-life task 49 healthy old adult . In addition group study , GMT evaluate single case study . Schweizer et al ( 2008 ) provide seven , weekly , two-hour session GMT patient focal damage cerebellum . Evaluation treatment include pre- , post- , long-term ( i.e. , 4 month post-intervention ) administration attention , executive functioning , self-report measure . Although modest improvement objective measure executive function observe , patient endorse significant improvement functional ability ( i.e. , return work ) . Similarly , Levine colleague ( 2000 ) observe improvement meal preparation , follow two session GMT , patient chronic stage recovery meningo-encephalitis . The GMT session focus five stage GMT use patient 's recipe train example . The effect GMT meal preparation maintain six-month follow-up evaluation . Recently , first control , partially randomize , study GMT complete patient chronic stage recovery focal brain injury exhibit persistent executive dysfunction ( Levine et al. , 2011 ) . Significant improvement sustain attention , behavioral consistency , problem-solving report GMT group , significant effect find control group . However , contrast previous study ( Levine et al. , 2007 ; van Hooren et al. , 2007 ) , change self-report measure everyday executive functioning observe . The author attribute lack change subjective report two possible factor : 1 ) absence collateral rating 2 ) reduce insight due executive dysfunction improve insight result increased item endorsement . The author conclude GMT effective intervention executive dysfunction , produce improvement train untrained behavior . Goal management training describe unique cognitive rehabilitation technique , give theoretical basis goal neglect follow frontal lobe damage emphasis real-life behavior ( Levine et al. , 2000 ) . The author also reveal , rehabilitation strategy generalize behavior , generalization must component intervention . This conclusion consistent Sohlberg Mateer 's ( 2001 ) suggestion clinicians `` program generalization '' train overlearning general strategy various location task , emphasize individual difficulty , incorporate significant others rehabilitation process , plan obstacle . It recommend rehabilitation executive dysfunction emphasize achievement independence functional activity generalization everyday activity ( Boelen , Spikman , &amp; Fasotti , 2011 ) . Given goal-oriented emphasis , focus individual everyday difficulty , report improvement self-reported executive failure mood , GMT appear ideal intervention individual functional executive function impairment . OBJECTIVES The purpose propose study evaluate effectiveness GMT group , emphasize compensatory strategy executive dysfunction ( e.g. , goal neglect attentional lapse ) , well relaxation train psychoeducation regard brain injury , sample adult outpatient identify executive dysfunction associate functional deficit . Specific objective include : 1 . Evaluation short-term efficacy GMT self- collateral-report everyday functioning . 2 . Evaluation short-term efficacy GMT neuropsychological outcome measure . 3 . Evaluation long-term ( i.e. , 1 year ) efficacy GMT self- collateral-report everyday functioning . 4 . Identification neuropsychological measure sensitive cognitive change follow GMT , use extensive battery neuropsychological test , compare previous study . 5 . Evaluation long-term ( i.e. , 1 year ) efficacy GMT neuropsychological outcome measure . 6 . Identify primary mediator change GMT compare control group receive two session relaxation train psychoeducation relative treatment group receive complete GMT program ( include relaxation training psychoeducation ) . HYPOTHESES Given emphasis goal-oriented rehabilitation reduce impact cognitive impairment daily functioning , rather attempt restore cognitive ability , reduction subjective report psychological distress anticipate . This hypothesis consistent exist literature reveal reduce report annoyance executive difficulty self-report inventory ( van Hooren et al. , 2007 ; Levine et al. , 2007 ) . Previous research identify improvement sustain attention visuospatial problem-solving task follow GMT ( Levine et al. , 2011 ) . The propose battery neuropsychological test include great number neuropsychological measure evaluate different neuropsychological function . Improvements test sustain attention visuospatial problem-solving , well small effect additional measure planning , also anticipate . METHODOLOGY Participants Group Assignment Participants randomly assign GMT Treatment Control Group . The GMT cognitive rehabilitation intervention program administer group format , consist 8 session , include structure psychoeducation , relaxation training , stepwise learning GMT . The Control Group program also administer group format , consist two session , include structure psychoeducation relaxation training . Participants assign Control condition offer opportunity complete full GMT program follow completion study . Intake : A screen interview patient significant conduct gather essential background demographic medical information , include self- collateral-report cognitive , emotional , functional status . Participants refer without baseline neuropsychological assessment undergo standardize neuropsychological battery . For patient referred brief cognitive screen , additional neuropsychological measure administer . GMT Treatment Group : A modify ( i.e. , include psychoeducation relaxation training ) GMT cognitive rehabilitation intervention program administer group format . Each group consist six participant ensure sufficient time address group individual functional difficulty . Although cost-effective , large group patient executive dysfunction plan , give prominence organizational attention deficit among patient executive dysfunction . The modified GMT intervention consist seven group session , similar van Hooren et al ( 2007 ) , individual session neuropsychologist Session 5 . Sessions hold twice weekly . The manualized group session include : ( 1 ) structure psychoeducation introduce participant brain executive functioning , relationship stress cognitive functioning , relaxation training ; ( 2 ) stepwise learn GMT , include education regard attentional lapse goal neglect , well in-session practice target individual everyday functional deficit goal maximize generalization . Homework assignment target individual functional deficit assign follow session . Control Group : Participants randomly assign Control condition participate two group session emphasize psychoeducation relaxation training . The propose Control condition go beyond current standard care , include cognitive psychological intervention beyond neuropsychological medical assessment . In keep GMT Treatment group , Control group consist six participant . Sessions schedule along side GMT Treatment session ( i.e. , two session one week )</detailed_description>
