	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) one main neurodegenerative disease incidence 3 % patient old 65 year . Anesthesia PD patient focus several study concern interactive reaction anesthetic anti-Parkinsonian medication Parkinsonian symptom . However , previous experience show patient undergo pulse generator placement prone involve delay emergence recovery room , report yet . We speculate PD patient might special population abnormal pharmacodynamic character anesthetic , though related evidence could find support hypothesis . Therefore , project investigate whether remifentanl requirement inhibit patient ' response trachea intubation skin insertion PD patient undergo DBS pulse generator placement different non-PD patient undergo intracranial surgery reason PD .</brief_summary>
