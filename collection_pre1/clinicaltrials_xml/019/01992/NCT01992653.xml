	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , anti-tumor activity polatuzumab vedotin combination rituximab obinutuzumab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , prednisone ( CHP chemotherapy ) participants non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) . Participants receive escalate dos polatuzumab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) every 3 week combination standard dose rituximab plus CHP chemotherapy ( R-CHP ) obinutuzumab plus CHP chemotherapy ( G-CHP ) . Participants treat total six eight cycle accordance local institutional practice . Two parallel treatment arm explore dos polatuzumab vedotin combination R-CHP G-CHP . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) polatuzumab vedotin combination R-CHP identify combined G-CHP . Once MTD RP2D determine , polatuzumab vedotin dose MTD RP2D -1 combination G-CHP start dose escalation combination .</brief_summary>
