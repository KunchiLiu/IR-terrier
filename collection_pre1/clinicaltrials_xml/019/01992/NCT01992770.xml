	<detailed_description>STEP-UP : An innovative stepped-care model tailor behavioral medicine treatment management musculoskeletal pain primary care Background : Multimodal rehabilitation tailor behavioral medicine treatment provide patient suffer persistent activity limit pain accord current state-of-science . There also evidence simple specific 'stay-active advice ' produce effect comparable effect comprehensive treatment package . Nevertheless , gap knowledge regard individual benefit modality pain treatment , time point , high cost-effectiveness . Accordingly , set innovative stepped-care protocol management musculoskeletal pain primary care , evaluate randomize control trial . The intervention two core feature : theory-driven include systematic tailor treatment content . The tailor base combination empirically support behavioural medical determinant pain-related disability patient ' individual perception personal goal , facilitator barrier HBC . In application , intervention label tailored behavioural medicine intervention ( TBM ) . Main objectives 1 . To compare short- ( post-treatment ) long-term effect ( 12 24 month follow-up ) TBM physical exercise treatment everyday life activity , health relate quality life , pain severity , sick leave ( main analysis ) . 2 . To study whether TBM tailor accord two pre-defined patient risk profile : `` catastrophising/fear-avoidance profile '' `` moderate high disability profile '' effective compare physical exercise treatment ( sub- group analysis ) . 3 . To characterize patient benefit/do benefit ( 1 ) minimal intervention include advice , ( 2 ) TBM physical exercise treatment respectively 4 . To identify potential moderator ( e.g . pain duration , sex , outcome expectation ) mediator ( e.g . catastrophising , fear movement , self-efficacy ) treatment effect . 5 . To study cost-effectiveness within experimental trial i.e . TBM versus physical exercise treatment entire study period ( 24-month follow- ) . Methods : A stratified randomized step care design apply . Stratification base primary care center patient risk profile . A consecutive selection perform primary care center southern , central northern Sweden . According power analysis , 364 participant recruit allow sub-group analysis . After receive minimal intervention ( step 1 ) comprise 'stay-active advice ' , participant score &gt; 90 Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire ( ÖMPQ ) randomly allocate eight-week treatment step 2 . The experimental condition include supervised physical exercise integrate either ( ) grade activity , ( b ) hierarchical grade exposure depend risk profile , i.e . absence presence pain catastrophizing fear-avoidance belief . The comparison condition include supervised physical exercise irrespective risk profile . Primary outcome pain-related disability complement comprehensive set secondary outcome adhere IMMPACT recommendation . Assessments make personnel blind treatment condition baseline , step 1 2 respectively , 12- 24-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
