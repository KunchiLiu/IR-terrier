	<detailed_description>1. . Justification The performance phone-guided chest compression recommend minimize No Flow risk ( 1 ) . Pre-arrival instruction dispatch-assisted chest compression first link chain survival , determine effectiveness subsequent link . This first link possible prior detection cardiac arrest make . The Dispatch Center Fire Brigade Paris receive 7,000 call per day , include 8-10 call cardiac arrest . The establishment specific train experience feedback emergency dispatcher improve detection cardiac arrest ( CA ) dispatcher . 2. . Objectives The main objective measure improvement detection rate CA Dispatch Center result debriefing repeat training non-medical operator receive emergency call . The secondary objective identify risk factor CA non-detection emergency dispatcher . 3. . Materials Methods Experimental design : Observational prospective non-randomized control study . Type `` '' study . Three observation period define total period 20 month . Different action period : Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Algorithm available emergency dispatcher + + + New algorithm - - + Basic train new operator - + + Daily brief +/- +/- + Systematic Debreafing - - + Specific course period - - + Table leader train - - + Heads room train - - + Period 1 precede accompany diffusion decision algorithm available emergency dispatcher Period 2 accompany : - Short briefing , twice daily , presence operator duty day - Debriefing immediately call operator ( systematically , depend availability ) . Period 3 precede information Dispatch Center manager ( head room table leader ) short course detection CA ( 1 hour ) operator . During period , daily briefing operator establish . The study base three CA call period ' audio recording For period , call related CA field listen evaluated . Each call double audition : - one audition instructor , responsible manage call Dispatch Center , - one audition two emergency physician experience management emergency call . The second listening physician help verify , correct , complete variable collect first listen The variable collect listening : - `` detectability CA '' - detection CA - cause non-detection - occurrence dispatch-assisted chest compression - time start call time operator pronounces word `` cardiopulmonary Resuscitation '' `` CPR '' `` chest compression '' - time start call first real chest compression - cause non-realization chest compression - presence absence public defibrillator Other variable collect - Variables correspond Utstein style : - Epidemiological variable ( age , sex , location , background ) - Specific backup system variable : time alert - use AED - Specific first aid medical management variable : - type rhythm detect AED arrival rescuer - Success first AED 's shock ( loss ventricular fibrillaton ( VF ) 5 second shock ) - Number shock administer AED first 10 minute support rescuer - Recovery palpable pulse presence rescuer , arrival medical team - Resuscitation undertaken medical team YES/NO - Injection adrenaline : YES/NO - Transport hospital beat heart : YES/NO - Released resuscitation YES/NO - Survival one year CA - Quality survival ( CPC score ) 6 month , 1 year Main judgment criterion : - Detection CA emergency dispatcher : - Detection consider positive dispatcher formalize presence CA , either software , orally word `` CPR '' `` chest compression '' time record call . - It consider negative dispatcher never suggest , neither orally write , possibility presence CA . - Secondary endpoint : - Median time start emergency call pronunciation word `` chest compression , '' dispatcher - Median time elapsed start emergency call actual start chest compression caller - Evaluation ventilation mode ( hand abdomen YES/NO , count interval two ventilatory movement YES/NO ) 4. . Statistics Sample size We need 100 patient period group observe absolute 20 % difference rate CA detection , compare detection rate control group ( period 1 ) estimate 60 % , alpha risk = 0.05 80 % power bilateral situation . For period : - Description patient characteristic outcome Comparison period : - Comparison detection rate reference period ( P1 ) period - The number subject include period allows realization χ² test alpha risk retain 5 % - Adjust detection rate significantly different variable group ( age , sex , flow , time rescuer arrival ) - The period 1 2 grouped compare period 3 . In period : - Search variable associate successful detection - Multivariate logistic regression analysis type - Survival analysis . - Description evolution detection rate time</detailed_description>
