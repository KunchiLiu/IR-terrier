	<brief_summary>There grow evidence exercise-based rehabilitation result improvement mobility participation person multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . However , vast majority scientific evidence support view base person MS minimal mobility impairment . This partially due lack accessible exercise equipment facility available person severe mobility limitation . One option available person severe mobility limitation body weight support treadmill training . Indeed , rehabilitation approach utilized success various clinical population , stroke spinal cord injury , believe target neuroplasticity . Specific person MS , body weight support treadmill train show great promise improve quality life , symptoms functional mobility two small ( n=4 n=6 ) pilot investigation . However , previous research hamper methodological limitation include small sample size , lack control group limit training session . Consequently , firm conclusion regard benefit body weight supported treadmill train person MS drawn . The propose project seek determine twenty-weeks body weight support treadmill train lead improvement physiological function , mobility quality life person MS severe mobility limitation . The outcome project potential lead new rehabilitation approach capable improve function quality life person advance MS .</brief_summary>
