	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) image predictive treatment response patient stage IB-IVA cervical cancer . MRI procedure radio wave powerful magnet link computer use create detailed picture area inside body . PET procedure small amount radioactive glucose ( sugar ) inject vein , scanner use make detailed , computerized picture area inside body glucose take . Comparing result diagnostic procedure , MRI PET , do , radiation chemotherapy may help doctor predict patient 's response treatment help plan best treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI PET Imaging Predicting Treatment Response Patients With Stage IB-IVA Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess value MRI PET non-invasive predictive assay therapy outcome cervical cancer . OUTLINE : Patients undergo radiation therapy receive chemotherapy per standard care . Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE ) MRI , diffusion-weighted ( DW ) MRI , magnetic resonance ( MR ) spectroscopy baseline , 2-2.5 week , 4-5 week , 1 month follow radiation therapy completion , fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) PET/computed tomography ( CT ) baseline , 2-2.5 week , 4-5 week . After completion study , patient follow least every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
