	<brief_summary>The primary objective propose study determine multi-modality teach curriculum utilize high-fidelity simulation didactic lecture result sustain improvement internal medicine resident write knowledge clinical performance compare resident receive curriculum utilize didactic lecture . The investigator hypothesis addition high-fidelity simulation traditional didactic lecture curriculum result sustain superior write knowledge practical performance compare group receive didactic lecture topic . Specifically , investigator assess internal medicine resident knowledge performance area sepsis hospitalize patient , shape investigator teach curriculum around focus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utility High-Fidelity Simulation In Education Assessment Residents Recognition Management Sepsis Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized prospective single-blinded pilot study . Residents internal medicine residency program assign unique number de-identify , randomize , stratify post-graduate year ( PGY ) level , random number generator intervention control group . Only de-identified information use subsequent analysis , individual result use . Residents know group randomize . Both intervention control group take pre-course survey assess level training , area specialty/interest , level confidence recognition management sepsis . Both intervention control group put 2-4 simulated scenario use high-fidelity simulation . In intervention group , scenario sepsis syndrome scenario . In control group , non-sepsis scenario administer . Immediately follow scenario , write knowledge quiz focus recognition management sepsis administer subject group . Following quiz , debrief session subject group simulation scenario , point do correctly . There brief didactic teaching session focus recognition management sepsis administer subject group . 2-4 month later , subject group bring back simulation lab test new identical set simulate sepsis scenario . This videotape scored impartial volunteer score performance accord check-list critical action . Following simulated scenario , write quiz administer first visit give . Subjects group get debriefed performance . Data compare control intervention group term write practical performance . Other potential analysis include performance intervention group , comparison intervention control group , well subanalysis PGY level . Student 's pair unpaired t-test model statistical analysis , investigator utilize statistician data analysis . In develop implement multi-modality sepsis teach curriculum , demonstrate superiority didactic-only curriculum , investigator hope justify permanent implementation multi-modality teaching module educate resident ( healthcare personnel ) lead improve recognition management sepsis improve patient outcome .</detailed_description>
