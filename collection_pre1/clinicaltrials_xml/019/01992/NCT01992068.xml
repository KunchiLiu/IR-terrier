	<brief_title>Pilot Study : Utilizing Manometry Assess Radiation-Induced Changes Esophageal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As standard care evaluate/visualize effect radiation therapy ( RT ) -induced esophageal injury , routinely assess patient report account , symptom manage supportively ( e.g . pain medicine , parenteral nutrition , feed tube etc ) . Manometry frequently use study effect RT gastrointestinal function set numerous malignancy , include colorectal , cervical prostate cancer . What often see RT decrease sphincter function anorectal region lead problem continence fecal urgency , however rigorous evaluation esophageal function RT . One study perform 15 year ago include 4 patient lung cancer conclude mucosal irritation likely primary cause RT-associated esophageal injury abnormality motility see . Radiation know cause long-term esophageal injury include stricture , manometric evidence impaired motility long-term RT . The recent introduction high-resolution manometry permit extensive evaluation effect RT esophageal function .</detailed_description>
