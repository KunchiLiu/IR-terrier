	<detailed_description>Retention patient HIV care follow diagnosis enrollment chronic challenge resource rich resource poor setting ( Rosen , Fox et al . 2007 ; WHO 2009 ; Fox Rosen 2010 ) , critical long-term success HIV care treatment scale-up . Most research retention care focus person eligible initiated antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , generally examine demographic clinical determinant . However , large proportion patient enrol HIV care ( e.g. , 45 % , accord data 722 sub-Saharan African clinic ) determine ART-eligible yet initiate ART ; among individual , even less known magnitude determinant non-retention care . Retention HIV care prior ART initiation pre-requisite : 1 ) optimal prophylaxis , diagnosis , treatment opportunistic illness ( OIs ) ; 2 ) effective secondary prevention HIV transmission , patient counseling education , early diagnosis infect family member sexual partner , prevention mother child transmission ( PMTCT ) ; 3 ) timely ART initiation . Retention care among patient earlier disease stage also increasingly important give WHO-recommended expansion ART eligibility guideline resource-limited setting ( WHO 2009 ) . Objective : The goal study well understand barrier enablers retention engagement HIV care among adult patient enrol HIV care yet eligible ART . The specific objective : 1 . To describe theme barrier enablers retention engagement HIV care ; 2 . To conduct structured interview gather relevant baseline information potential determinant non-retention non-engagement HIV care ; 3 . To estimate incidence short-term outcome ( miss visit lose follow-up ( LTF ) ) , include rate proportion LTF longer engage HIV care ; 4 . To identify determinant miss visit , LTF , non-engagement care among ART-ineligible patient . Methods : This study conduct use qualitative quantitative method four HIV care treatment clinic ( CTCs ) Kagera Region , Tanzania . 1 . Qualitative : in-depth interview two CTCs 20 adult patient ( ART naïve , ineligible indeterminate ART ) 4 health care worker ; focus group discussion ( 4 group 6-10 persons/group ) adult patient ( ART naïve , ineligible indeterminate ART ) . 2 . Quantitative : 1 ) structure baseline interview four CTCs ( n= approximately 900 adult patient ART naïve , ineligible indeterminate ART ) ; 2 ) prospective monitoring 900 patient use routine CTC patient data ass miss visit LTF ; 4 ) brief structured survey patient become LTF reach defaulter trace effort .</detailed_description>
