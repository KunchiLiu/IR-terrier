	<brief_summary>Gut microbiota increasingly recognize important factor fat distribution , insulin sensitivity glucose lipid metabolism . Accordingly , intestinal microbiota could play important role development obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus . The role gut-derived short-chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) , formation enhance microbial fermentation fiber , still controversial . One study find increase formation SCFA stimulate energy extraction diet , subsequent weight gain . In contrast , supplementation non-fermentable carbohydrate , lead increase SCFA formation , beneficial effect body weight control insulin sensitivity . Of note , study show butyrate supplementation mouse prevent diet-induced obesity insulin resistance . At present time , understanding effect SCFA human metabolism ( gut systemically ) still limit . Yet , light health claim certain dietary fiber ( prebiotics ) , detailed picture physiology human SCFA metabolism interaction microbiome pivotal importance . We hypothesize differential availability SCFA impact human metabolism differently . To determine whether rectal administration SCFA good model study metabolic effect SCFA first perform pilot study ( METC 11-3-079 ) . In pilot study determine rectal administration sodium acetate effect substrate energy metabolism compare proximal administration . Our result indicate primary outcome parameter fat oxidation significantly change post-absorptive condition , sodium acetate concentration 180mM administer distal part colon . In contrast , effect energy expenditure substrate oxidation see sodium acetate administer proximal colon . Consequently , distal part colon seem good model determine effect gut-derived SCFA human substrate energy metabolism . Therefore , administer study SCFA rectally use enema . We administer different combination SCFA healthy , overweight male volunteer examine effect metabolism . This study important part Gastrointestinal Health TIFN project ( GH003 WP 1.2 ) , provide insight increase availability beneficial SCFA mixture might serve basis rational nutritional strategy prevention treatment obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus . To obtain rational nutritional strategy , next step TIFN project focus dietary ingredient modulate intestinal microbiota subsequent SCFA production .</brief_summary>
