	<brief_summary>The Cerebellum contains ten percent total volume brain receives brain , spinal cord vestibular sensory input . The organization vestibular somato-sensory afferent information also report impaired patient cerebellum dysfunction . Ataxia impaired balance control common symptom individual spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCA ) . Previous study show patient cerebellar damage usually agonist antagonist muscle coordination problem . Past study also find regulation reciprocal Ia inhibition impair patient spinaocerebellar ataxia . In chronic phase , weakness might develop due deconditioned . All deficit mention might lead decrease functional ability . Therefore , increase somato-sensory vestibular input , normalize modulation recriprocal inhibition , improve muscle strength might able improve functional ability individual SCA . Recently , whole body vibration ( WBV ) train health group . Studies show WBV train able improve muscle strength , balance control , functional ability . However , evidence show whether whole body vibration train affect brain spinal cord regulation neural circuit . Whether also affect maximal voluntary contraction improve central fatigue . No previous study whole body vibration training SCA . Therefore , purpose research investigate intracortical facilitation inhibition , reciprocal Ia inhibition , low frequency depression , maximal voluntary contraction , interpolated twitch technique compare different SCA health subject . Also investigate short term long term effect WBV .</brief_summary>
