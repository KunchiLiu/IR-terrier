	<brief_summary>This clinical validation study aim establish birch pollen challenge Fraunhofer ECC patient allergic birch pollen . The symptom record validated symptom score Total Nasal Symptom Score ( TNSS ) , allow determine whether challenge dose dependent reproducible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monocenter 6-period Study Patients With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Birch Pollen Establish Challenge Model With Natural Birch Pollen Environmental Challenge Chamber ( ECC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This mono-center , single-blind , placebo control study assess nasal symptom patient allergic rhinitis upon exposure birch pollen environmental challenge chamber 4 hour challenge period different concentration birch pollen versus placebo . Subjects allergic rhinitis birch pollen recruit Fraunhofer ITEM database surround community . After screen evaluation eligible subject undergo six challenge session environmental challenge chamber interval least one week . In order determine dose response , concentration birch pollen atmosphere challenge chamber varied 1000 birch pollen/m³ first period , 2000 birch pollen/m³ second period , 4000 birch pollen/m³ third period , 8000 birch pollen/m³in fourth period 0 birch pollen/m³ ( air ) fifth period . In order investigate reproducibility addition dose response , challenge one concentration previously use repeated period six . The dose chosen Investigator accord observe nasal symptom . According previous experience grass pollen ( Dactylis glomerata ) target symptom level TNSS around 6 . Therefore , dose study reproducibility choose average mean TNSS last two hour closest six . If two dos equally close , high dose chosen allow optimize particle monitoring technique . In regard , good high particle concentration order separate specific particle unspecific particle ( originate subject ) .</detailed_description>
