	<brief_summary>Repetitive negative thinking ( RNT ) play important role different psychiatric disorder , depressive anxiety disorder , complicate grief , anorexia nervosa . RNT see vulnerability factor onset , duration , severity relapse disorder . Although lot theoretical research , un- known training program address RNT surplus effect Treatment Usual ( TAU ) . Our hypothesis training intervention show significant effect decline RNT activity , reduce identification worrying/rumination , reduce score metacognitions questionnaire , compare TAU ( medication , psychotherapy combination treatment ) . Further expect effect RNT temporary beneficial effect remain present long time ( 6 month ) . Our third hypothesis claim reduce RNT effect Quality Life , self-esteem depressive anxiety score ( measure BDI-II STAI ) . Fourth hypothesis concern effect train function neurobiological level . Here expect ruminative patient beneficial effect RNT increase top-down prefrontal ( dorsolateral ) cortical control overactive bottom-up limbic system . To examine neurobiological effect , apply multimodal approach combine rest state fMRI , structural MRI diffuse tensor imaging ( DTI ) , anterior spin labelling ( ASL ) . Further , department develop audio critique task participant hear different kind critique amongst negative valence especially problematic ruminative patient reflect difficulty difference top-down/bottom-up process compare healthy control group baseline . Further , hypothesize RNT successful neuronal process normalize . We expect change wait list group . To examine clinical neuronal effect , people suffer GAD and/or depression allocate randomisation active treatment condition ( ATC ) wait list control group WLC ) . All participant patient treat general practitioner , psychologist psychiatrist . Training exist 8 session group ( max 12 participant ) weekly basis , except last session , take place one month ) . During train people get information RNT , train focus attention , receive basic idea become aware dysfunctional thinking learn cop strategy stimulus control engaging activity . Measurement take place treatment ATC . The WLC measure start ATC 12 week . Measurement take place mean questionnaire fMRI . During fMRI people undergo rest state paradigm task trigger RNT . After three 6 month , time interval 3 6 month , participant evaluate RNT mean questionnaire . At end training , 8th session , two participant per run ask cooperate qualitative in-depth interview . We interested link result train factor quantity session , degree active participation session . We also interest define intervention perceive useful link disorder usefulness intervention .</brief_summary>
