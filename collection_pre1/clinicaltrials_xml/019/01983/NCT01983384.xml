	<brief_summary>There recent , limited evidence suggest anesthetic depth associate poor postoperative cognitive outcome . Specifically , several study suggest deep level anesthesia associate increased incidence postoperative delirium longer-term cognitive decline . In fact , suggest old patient undergo surgery routinely monitor anesthetic depth monitor allow titration anesthetic sedation medication light level promote well postoperative cognitive outcome . However , practice never validate proven feasible safe . Accordingly , investigator plan exploratory study determine feasibility safety randomize patient undergo major surgery receive deep vs. light anesthetic level surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anesthesia Depth And Postoperative Delirium Trial 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In exploratory grant , investigator aim determine whether two different anesthetic depth measure anesthetic depth monitor practice uniformly number anesthesia provider safety across large group old surgical patient . The investigator use randomize control trial design randomize 232 patient receive `` light '' v `` deep '' anesthesia measure anesthetic depth monitor . Postoperative outcome include delirium cognitive measurement .</detailed_description>
