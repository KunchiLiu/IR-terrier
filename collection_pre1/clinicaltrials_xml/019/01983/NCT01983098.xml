	<detailed_description>Description Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) real public health problem world . In Western country , CRC third common cancer second leading cause cancer death . The prognosis CRC closely associate tumor stage diagnosis . Despite widespread screen program , CRC diagnose metastatic stage approximately 35 % case , 20 % 50 % patient diagnose early stage ( stage II III ) develop distant metastasis subsequently . For patient metastatic CRC , improve surgical technique , advance cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen ( fluoropyrimidin , oxaliplatin irinotecan ) progress target therapy ( antiangiogenic anti-EGFR therapy ) increase survival improve quality life . These patient usually treat every 2 week chemotherapy regimens tumor response evaluate every 2 month compute tomography ( CT ) scan use RECIST criterion ( Therasse P , J Natl Cancer Inst 92:205-216 , 2000 ) . These morphological criterion determine several tumor response : complete remission ( CR ) disappearance lesion , partial response ( PR ) reduction least 30 % sum large diameter lesion target , progression disease ( PD ) increase least 20 % sum large diameter target lesion appearance new lesion , stable disease ( SD ) correspond low decrease 30 % high 20 % sum target lesion ( P Therasse , J Natl Cancer Inst 92:205-216 , 2000 ) . Treatment change case PD , usually continue case objective tumor response control disease . Moreover , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) carbohydrate antigen ( CA ) 19-9 serum biomarkers clinically useful evaluate efficacy treatment patient metastatic CRC sensitivity 50 70 % . Therefore , case early tumor resistance treatment , PD objectify CT scan 2 month treatment , expose patient unnecessary toxicity could sometimes severe . Early biomarkers tumor response need well management treatment patient metastatic CRC . CRC characterize highly specific genetic alteration . Some molecular alteration may predictive ( tailor protocol chemotherapy ) prognostic ( evaluate severity disease ) biomarkers useful therapeutic management patient . For example , KRAS tumor mutation associate lack response anti-EGFR target therapy ( Lievre A , J Clin Oncol 2008 , 26:374-9 ; Lievre A , Cancer Res 2006,66:3992-5 ) , BRAF mutation prognostic ( Van Cutsem E , J Clin Oncol 2011 , 29:2011-19 ) . Specific genetic alteration tumor also detect circulate tumor DNA patient CRC ( Lecomte T , Int J Cancer 2002 , 100:543-8 ) . Indeed , circulate DNA fragment carry tumor specific sequence alteration ( circulate tumor DNA ) find fraction blood , represent variable generally small fraction total circulating DNA . Recently , study show circulate tumor DNA informative , inherently specific , highly sensitive biomarker monitoring metastatic breast cancer treatment ( N Engl J Med . 2013 ; 368:1199-209 ) . However , knowledge , analysis circulate tumor DNA monitor metastatic CRC perform yet . The aim study determine biomarker evaluate precociously response chemotherapy monitoring circulate tumor DNA . Patients Methods Results CT imaging , level CEA CA 19-9 , serial whole-blood sample collect prospectively patient undergo therapy metastatic CRC . DNA extract archival tumor tissue sample analyse identify somatic genomic alteration ( KRAS , NRAS , BRAF , TP53 , PI3KCA , APC , SMAD4 â€¦ ) . Blood sample collect EDTA tube every two week cycle chemotherapy . Blood sample process within 2 hour collection centrifuge separate plasma peripheral-blood cell . DNA extract plasma . To measure DNA carry specific somatic genomic alteration plasma , investigator carry microfluidic digital polymerase-chain-reaction ( PCR ) assay ( Taly V , Clin Chem 2013 ) . The investigator compare monitor circulate tumor DNA result CT scan accord RECIST criterion blood level CEA CA 19-9 .</detailed_description>
