	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Evaluation Treatment Repetetive Behaviors Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project 3-week double blind cross-over trial adolescent adults meet criterion autism clinically prominent repetitive behavior . The investigator apply low frequency rTMS 20 minute 5 time week 3 week target area brain involve repetitive behavior . The investigator obtain clinical measure repetitive behavior well social function pre post treatment . As control cross-over condition , stimulate area brain nothing repetitive behavior may improve social function autism spectrum disorder . In addition r TMS perform pre post treatment perfusion functional MRI obtain TMS measure excitability brain .</detailed_description>
