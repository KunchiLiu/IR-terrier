	<brief_summary>Beachchair position use many orthopaedic surgeon shoulder surgery . Most patient undergo surgery position complication . However , report case postoperative neurological deficit highlight risk cerebral spinal cord ischemia . The etiology complication remain unclear . The plausible explanation event would intraoperative hypotension follow cerebral hypoperfusion . General anesthesia commonly use shoulder surgery conjunction interscalene brachial plexus blockade . During block , local anesthetic 's spread frequently observe leading block sympathetic fibre . Since nerve locate head neck area go stellate ganglion , block cause sympathetic denervation decrease peripheral vascular resistance , thus increase circulation cerebral blood vessel . In normal situation , vasoconstriction cerebral blood vessel response sympathetic stimulation vasodilation sympathetic fibre block . Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) non-invasive examination provide reliable evaluation intracranial blood flow real-time . It help detect sudden change perfusion identify potential embolic event . Some study use TCD show increase ipsilateral cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) secondary reduce vascular tone associate stellate ganglion block . Others show reduction contralateral CBF could theoretically increase risk ischemia affect area . This study assess role interscalene nerve blockade protection cerebral ischemia preservation cerebral autoregulation . This study also aim identify change contralateral CBF . The investigator hypothesize : 1 . Interscalene nerve block increase CBF 2 . Interscalene nerve block decrease contralateral CBF 3 . Cerebral autoregulation preserve general anesthesia conjunction interscalene nerve block setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior surgery , patient undergo baseline bilateral TCD examination supine position . If Doppler 's result satisfactory , patient randomize proceed next step . In case inadequate result , patient 's participation study terminate . The interscalene nerve block insertion interscalene catheter perform accord randomization . In interscalene nerve block catheter group , attend anaesthesiologist ass success block record presence absence Horner 's syndrome . The transcranial Doppler operator blind observation . Following insertion interscalene catheter , patient undergo second bilateral TCD supine position induction anesthesia . The anesthetic technique monitoring standardize . After induction anesthesia , bilateral TCD perform patient supine position . Another examination perform general anesthesia immediately 30 minute follow installation patient beachchair position . A last TCD perform reduction end-tidal carbon dioxide 30 mm Hg . For examination , arterial blood pressure must stabilize least 5 minute Doppler initiate . Arterial blood pressure measure examination . Type , duration surgery beachchair position record . Vasopressor therapy note . Body temperature , end-tidal carbon dioxide minimum alveolar concentration desflurane collect examination perform general anesthesia .</detailed_description>
