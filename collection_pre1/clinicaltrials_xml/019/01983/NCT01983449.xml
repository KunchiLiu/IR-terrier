	<brief_summary>To assess safety effectiveness adventitial deposition Study Drug reduce inflammation restenosis patient clinical evidence claudication critical limb ischemia angiographically significant lesion superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery . Study Drug Dose : Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection , USP , 4 mg/ml , dilute contrast ( 17 % ) administer adventitia dose 1.6 mg per cm desire vessel treatment length .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Adventitial Dexamethasone Peripheral Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial examine ability adventitial dexamethasone safely delay restenosis patient least 18 year age , peripheral atherosclerotic lesion involve superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery . These patient current therapeutic alternative beyond procedure use open , revascularize , superficial femoral and/or popliteal artery . Metal stent potential fracture implant artery segment due continual flexion bend knee . It desirable improve patency artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) and/or atherectomy-based revascularization .</detailed_description>
