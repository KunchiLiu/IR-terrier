	<detailed_description>Children live life-limiting condition always part health care system . Although dramatic improvement medical care , hundred child continue die annually . In Switzerland , approximately 400 child ( 0 14 year age ) die year , three quarter due medical condition . Infant death account approximately half death childhood mostly due perinatal condition . Complex chronic condition congenital chromosomal abnormality , diseases nervous system , cancer cardiac condition constitute important group disease-related death childhood . This underlines rationale include child die due oncological , cardiological neurological disease neonatal period ( birth four week life ) study . Characteristics End-of-Life ( EOL ) Care death childhood When burden disease poor quality life outweigh potential benefit disease related treatment , focus care shift towards prepare anticipate death manage end stage terminal medical condition . Through process literature review , clinician parent survey interview , six domain high-quality , family-centred EOL care identify : 1 ) support family unit [ unit care child family , whereas family define provide comfort child , regardless genetic relationship ] ; 2 ) communication child family treatment goal plan ; 3 ) ethic share decision making ; 4 ) relief pain symptom ; 5 ) continuity care ; 6 ) grief bereavement support . Nonetheless , question best provide EOL care die child remain inadequately answer , systematic study EOL care child . Apart , lack interventional study , difficult perform ethical sensitive field care . Dying home often associate good quality EOL care `` good death '' view patient prefer die home commonly accept . In reality , paediatric home death rate , although grow , remain low 20 % 1999-2003 United States . There evidence parent whose child die home cancer show low level grief-related symptom psychological distress . However recent study Dussel et al . show opportunity plan place death associate outcomes consistent high-quality EOL care , thus may represent relevant outcome actual place death . Neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) play particular important role EOL care place high percentage paediatric patient die . For newborn , rarely exist valuable alternative NICU . It important know , circumstance child die , know impact characteristic death overall satisfaction parent EOL care . No data current practice EOL care characteristic child 's death exists Switzerland . Parents ' perspective EOL care die child EOL care vulnerable patient family demand comprehensive approach include need health care professional understand illness experience perspective die child family . Guidelines EOL care child focus effective symptom management clear communication , yet parent ' value EOL care still partly unknown . There overwhelming evidence communication central concern parent principle determinant high-quality care . Professional support last four week life significant factor associate worked grief parent lose child cancer . Recently , qualitative study conduct Switzerland explore perception need family care child life-limiting disease . Shortcomings demonstrate basic need affected family psychosocial support , coordination care bereavement support outline . To get comprehensive picture parental perspectives population-based assessment need quantify explain experience needs . This achievable questionnaire survey interview parent . As showcased systematic literature review , tool exist assess need parent whose child die ( i.e. , PICU ) . Questionnaires use field EOL care , none fit unique requirement PELICAN research programme cover four distinct diagnostic group . Perspectives health care professional Several study report barrier provision paediatric palliative care ( PPC ) EOL care . To develop successful program PPC EOL care Switzerland , barrier gap knowledge , professional attitude , skill structural precondition need perceive . In Germany , recent study reveal significant shortcoming finance specialist nursing home care necessarily include funding coordination case-management . Another issue require openness towards PPC EOL care professional , particularly physicians prerequisite family-centred EOL care . There article describe assess attitudinal , educational institutional issue professional . One study Australia develop questionnaire measure barrier facilitator palliative care neonatal nursing . From 645 neonatal nurse 57 % report staff adequate support palliative care practice , 57 % report environment unit conducive provide palliative care die infant , 62 % felt often go beyond estimate comfortable provide technological life support die new-borns . A study United States describe barrier EOL care child family , perceive paediatric health care provider . An important finding , perceive barrier paediatric EOL care differ impede adult EOL care . Commonly perceive barrier paediatric EOL care involve uncertainty prognosis discrepancy treatment goal staff member family member . Improved staff education may help overcome obstacle ; however , effective method improve nurse ' physician ' competence PPC EOL care remain establish . In Switzerland , recent study 76 paediatric health care professional explore expectation specialise PPC team . From perspective non-specialised care provider task would particularly encompass coach attend team , coordination care , symptom control , direct support affect family beyond illness child . More systematic data specific knowledge situation Switzerland urgently need meet need health care professional provide adequate knowledge best provide EOL care . Rationale The field paediatric palliative care ( PPC ) EOL care base principle interdisciplinary team care patient family . However , evidence provide optimal PPC EOL care cover need child family scarce lag substantially behind adult world . Few know EOL care - define last four week life study - presently provide Swiss health setting . Generalizability study result country limit . In contrast many country , paediatric hospice Switzerland . EOL care challenge health professional . Being aware current practice parent ' perspective help show difference good quality EOL care support make family lose child . To meet parent ' value care , important ass need vulnerable group directly . Diverse medical condition imply different need . This circumstance demand development survey instrument match specific diagnosis specific illness . In addition parent ' , evaluation perspective need health professional important development service use non-specialized care provider . The combination qualitative quantitative approach enhances comprehensive discovery existentially high subjective human experience .
