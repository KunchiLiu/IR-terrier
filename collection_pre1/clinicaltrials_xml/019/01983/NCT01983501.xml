	<brief_title>A Phase 1b Study ONT-380 Combined With Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine ( T-DM1 ) Patients With HER2+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b , open-label study ONT-380 give combination ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) patient HER2+ breast cancer . Phase 1 use 3+3 dose escalation design evaluate four dose level ONT-380 order identify maximal tolerate dose/recommended dose ( MTD/RD ) ONT-380 combination T-DM1 . T-DM1 administer intravenously day 1 cycle ( except cycle 1 , administer day 2 allow PK assessments ONT-380 alone ) . ONT-380 administer orally , twice per day day 1-21 cycle . There 3-6 evaluable patient enrol cohort dose escalation phase , unless dose find intolerable prior completion enrollment . At least 6 evaluable patient treat dose level order MTD/RD declare . Once MTD/RD declare , additional 24 evaluable patient enrol MTD/RD expansion cohort total 30 evaluable patient treat MTD/RD . In addition MTD/RD expansion cohort , optional additional cohort 15 evaluable patient either untreated , asymptomatic CNS metastasis need immediate local therapy progressive CNS metastasis follow local therapy may also enrol treated MTD/RD . Up 63 evaluable patient may treat study .</detailed_description>
