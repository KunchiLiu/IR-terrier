	<brief_summary>The objective study determine systemically infused allogeneic bone marrow derive mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) home site prostate cancer men localize adenocarcinoma prostate planning undergo prostatectomy . Investigators plan systemically infuse MSCs 4 , 6 8 day prior enrolled subject ' plan prostatectomy . Investigators quantify relative amount donor MSC DNA recipient DNA present patient ' explanted prostate specimen . This accomplished via BEAMing digital PCR . This trial provide foundation future study aim engineering MSCs deliver toxin sit metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
