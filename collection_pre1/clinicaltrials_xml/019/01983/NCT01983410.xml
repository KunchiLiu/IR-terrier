	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand pancreatic cancer develop people know carrier gene mutation ( abnormality ) call BRCA , close relative PALB2 . The investigator hope establish BRCA/PALB2 mutation carrier Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ( common form pancreatic cancer ) Registry . A registry database information .</brief_summary>

Ashkenazi Jewish Descent ( least one parent Ashkenazi Jewish origin ) . Histologic proof primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . May either potentially curable ( resectable ) primary PDAC , localize unresectable primary PDAC , metastatic ( stage IV ) PDAC . Prior personal history malignancy ; either prior currently active , include breast , ovarian prostate cancer allow . Both previously treat previously untreated patient eligible . Previous treatment may include surgical resection , regional radiation therapy , systemic therapy . Patient may receive active therapy . Willing provide blood specimen correlative study . Willing provide permission obtain banked tumor tissue analysis ( previous biopsy surgical material ) . New tumor biopsy require entrance Registry . BRCA mutation carrier , relative BRCA PDAC patient , without PDAC BRCAmut related malignancy : ( Control Cohort 1 ) Known BRCA mutation carrier .
