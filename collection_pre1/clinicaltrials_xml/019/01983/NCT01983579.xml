	<brief_summary>This prospective , open label study assess 24-hour IOP pattern use TF patient undergo anti-VEGF injection treatment neovascular AMD ( age relate macular degeneration ) . The study propose patient AMD patient AMD concomitant open angle glaucoma ( OAG ) . The study conduct two stage . In stage , patient remain ambulatory encourage follow schedule close usual lifestyle possible , exception particular activity caffeine intake , play wind instrument , yoga strenuous exercise . A patient diary distribute capture patient activity TF pattern record . Upon completion session , CLS ( contact lens sensor ) remove final ophthalmic examination conduct . In first stage study , 20 patient neovascular AMD IOP normal range concomitant glaucoma recruit . After sign dated patient inform consent form , patient undergo initial ophthalmic examination . One eye select study . If eye eligible , study eye select random manner . All 20 AMD patient receive two 24-hour record session ( S ) TF CLS , monthly interval . In first session ( S1 ) anti-VEGF injection carry accord study center standard protocol . For second 24-hour TF recording session ( S2 ) , patient randomly distribute three group . Group A , consist 5 patient , receive anti-VEGF injection different anti-VEGF substance compare S1 . Group B , also consist 5 patient , receive anti-VEGF without sclerotomy occlusion injection compare S1 . Finally , group C , include 10 patient , receive anti-VEGF different dose ( injection volume ) compare S1 . The randomization ratio group A , B C 1:1:2 . The overall study duration eligible patient first stage study limit 5 week . If first stage study injection protocol identify provokes significantly less elevation TF pattern , alternative injection protocol evaluate current standard protocol . For second stage , 30 patient 15 neovascular AMD 15 neovascular AMD concomitant OAG recruit . After give informed consent confirmation eligibility , patient receive two 24-hour TF CLS record session ( S3 S4 ) monthly interval , anti-VEGF injection accord standard alternative protocol carry random sequence . The overall study duration patient second stage study limit 5 week . The study plan recruit 20 eligible patient first stage within 12 week date initiation . The second stage recruit 30 patient within 16 week . Hence overall study duration first patient accrue study last patient equate 33 week . Allowing database lock within 4 week study completion , preliminary statistical report primary efficacy endpoint foreseen within 2 week thereafter .</brief_summary>
