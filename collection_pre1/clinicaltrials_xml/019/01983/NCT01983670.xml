	<brief_summary>In individual spino-cerebellar atrophy ( SCA ) , delay onset antagonist muscle firing report cause hypermetria . Hypermetria common deficit individual spino-cerebellar atrophy SCA perform ballistic goal-directed movement . Based previous study , ballistic goal-directed movement control triphasic pattern agonistic antagonistic muscle activation . The origin EMG pattern central program , whereas delay onset antagonistic muscle firing report cause hypermetria . To develop therapy method , difference temporal pattern intensity supraspinal excitability agonist antagonist burst healthy adult individual SCA perform rapid slow goal-directed movement investigate . Traditional rehabilitation individual cerebellum lesion limit improve functional performance movement . Since deficit goal-directed movement pre-movement programming , feedforward train possible re-establish appropriate program . Previous show peripheral stimulation result facilitation motor cortex . Our group also find facilitation individual SCA similar one without SCA . Therefore , possible adjust control pattern supraspinal excitability agonist antagonist bust SCA patient passively provide electrical stimulation contain normal control pattern healthy human . The present study seek investigate difference temporal pattern intensity supraspinal excitability agonist antagonist burst healthy adult individual SCA perform rapid slow goal-directed movement .</brief_summary>
