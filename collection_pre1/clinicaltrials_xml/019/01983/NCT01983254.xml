	<brief_title>Improving Psychological Distress Among Critical Illness Survivors Their Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Public Summary Research Project Why important ? Nearly 800,000 Americans receive mechanical ventilation acute respiratory failure ICU year . Afterward , half patient family caregiver suffer psychological distress ( depression , anxiety , post-traumatic stress [ `` PTSD '' ] ) 1 year discharge . Patients family tell u need help distress worsens quality life . More specifically , patient say learning adapt ( , cope ) physical emotional change critical illness would helpful . In fact , ICU survivor use cop skill infrequently , worsen psychological distress . But patient also tell u want information critical illness , recovery , expect . A lack information increase PTSD symptom . However , treatment distress overcome ICU survivor ' physical disability , great distance expert medical center , concern much treatment would cost . Therefore , develop two treatment address cop lack information . What main goal ? We aim compare two treatment effective reduce psychological distress improve quality life . One cop skill train ( CST ) program provide telephone . The education program critical illness access primarily online . Also , determine unique group people special characteristic especially good improvementâ€”and , personal factor explain response . How know treatment well ? We determine treatment helpful compare participant ' level psychological distress quality life survey take 6 month . We 'll also record patient ' description treatment impacted daily life . The study take 3 year would perform 5 medical center across US treat patient diverse background illness . 200 ICU survivor-family member pair randomly assign ( like coin flip ) receive either CST program education program . Treatments consist 6 weekly telephone call trained staff member , web-based module , handout . How help others future ? This research important aim improve long-term recovery entire family focus devastating , common , yet inadequately addressed problem . These treatment develop direct input patient family . These treatment represent new direction treat critical illness deliver inexpensively phone , easily adapt future technology , overcome barrier care common ICU survivor , share easily phone computer others need across world .</detailed_description>
