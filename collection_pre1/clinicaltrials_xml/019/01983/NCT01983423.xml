	<brief_summary>Animal clinical study suggest local tissue trauma promote process embryo implant uterine cavity . The clinical study perform patient history previously fail treatment use vitro fertilization ; process stimulate many egg woman remove body , allow fertilisation sperm occur laboratory setting . The embryo replace uterine cavity . This study question whether endometrial biopsy ( place small straw like catheter cervix uterine cavity take sample tissue via suction bore catheter ) , within 5-10 day start cycle vitro fertilization , improve pregnancy outcome patient first second cycle treatment . The hypothesis endometrial biopsy improve pregnancy outcome . The study randomize multicentre study involve 3 Canadian fertility centre .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although data preliminary , study suggest mild endometrial trauma cycle precede IVF increase pregnancy rate , least woman recurrent implantation failure . Whether endometrial biopsy could promote implantation improve pregnancy rate large population woman undergo IVF yet explore . The present study address question examine impact endometrial biopsy IVF outcomes context randomize controlled trial . The optimal timing endometrial biopsy cycle precede IVF determine , majority study include biopsy mid-luteal phase precede cycle . In order allow adjuvant therapy IVF would consider tolerable subject , applicable large infertile woman population , determine single endometrial biopsy , perform approximately 1 week prior start control ovarian hyperstimulation ( COH ) IVF cycle , would simplest , flexible , generalizable intervention study effect pregnancy rate . All component IVF treatment remain constant approximately 8-12 day ovarian stimulation , human chorionic gonadotrophin ( HCG ) trigger administer time frame oocyte retrieval occur 36 hour later trigger . The embryo transfer take place either day 3 day 5 oocyte retrieval .</detailed_description>
