	<brief_title>A Structured Early Palliative Care Intervention Patients With Advanced Cancer - Randomized Controlled Trial With Nested Qualitative Study ( SENS Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Intervention ( perform specialist palliative care team ) : The structured approach intervention base NCCN Practice Guidelines Palliative Care , part Gold Standard Framework ( GSF ) WHO definition Palliative Care . It support assessment area complexity concern patient perspective , determine priority structure support need . SENS stand : Symptom-management , instruction self administration medication etc . End life decision-making : explicit definition goal priority ; Network organization include anticipatory planning emergency situation Support carers : implementation support system care family member The standardized intervention ( base prepare educational tool kit include patient prompt sheet ) perform palliative care physician nurse collaboratively randomization consent . The intervention undertaken ( baseline questionnaire first follow-up questionnaire ) . There total 4 questionnaire first 6 month . In addition , patient receive usual oncology care throughout study period ( see ) . Usual Oncology care ( performed oncological out- inpatient clinic ) : Usual care incorporate routine assessment accord national protocol , assess overall symptom current complaint domain . Participants assign usual care may meet palliative care service request accord establish practice without follow SENS approach ( subgroup analysis perform ) . Main eligibility criterion Patients &gt; /= 18 year age sign informed consent understand study procedure investigational nature study one follow cancer type : - Diagnosed within last 16 week - Metastatic locally advance , amenable curative treatment , non- small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , - Metastatic locally advance , amenable curative treatment , colorectal cancer , - Metastatic locally advance , amenable curative treatment , prostate cancer , - Metastatic locally advance , amenable curative treatment , breast cancer visceral and/or brain metastasis , - Metastatic locally advance , amenable curative treatment , bladder/ urothelium cancer , - Metastatic locally advance , amenable curative treatment , pancreatic cancer - Diagnosis histologically confirm - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 , 1 2 Exclusion criterion - Presence delirium dementia reason lack ability give inform consent - Inability communicate adequately German - Patient 's lack accountability , inability appreciate nature , mean consequence study formulate his/her wish correspondingly - Patients already receive care inpatient palliative care service Outcomes Primary outcomes - Distress six month measure National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) Distress thermometer Secondary outcomes - Quality life measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - General ( FACT-G ) - Palliative Outcome Scale ( POS ) - Overall survival - Location death - Health care utilization Objective The primary objective trial determine effectiveness early palliative care structure SENS ( systematic , problem-based assessment system ) addition standard oncology care compare standard oncology care alone relieve distress patient advance cancer end life . The secondary objective determine whether introduction SENS improve quality life prolongs overall survival patient , reduce health care cost medical resource utilization . The primary objective nest qualitative study identify characteristic reason add value well failure compulsory problem-based assessment system ( SENS ) advance cancer patient . Methods Design Multicenter , two-arm , parallel-group , randomized-controlled trial nest qualitative study ( content analysis ) Experimental arm : Palliative care structure approach ( SENS model ) base bio-psycho-social-spiritual model care . The approach support assessment area complexity concern patient perspective , determine priority structure support need . The intervention perform palliative care physician nurse collaboratively . Control arm : Patients usual care group receive routine oncology care throughout study .</detailed_description>
