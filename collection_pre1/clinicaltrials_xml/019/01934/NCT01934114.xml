	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether experimental alternative imaging method , Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( abbreviate NIR ) , use control respiratory system examine breast cancer . The NIR system use light beam produce image picture inside breast . The respiratory system help researcher get information breast tissue change amount oxygen tissue receive NIR imaging .</brief_summary>
