	<brief_title>Telomere Length Predicting Toxicity Older Patients With Stage III-IV Colorectal Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine relationship pre-treatment telomere length ( TL ) rate grade 3 high adverse event occur front line leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ) -based chemotherapy among patient age 70 early stage metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate impact FOLFOX-based chemotherapy treatment peripheral blood lymphocyte telomere length . II . To evaluate association pre-treatment geriatric assessment tool score , telomere length , incidence chemotherapy related adverse event among old early stage metastatic CRC patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate association pre-treatment level serum interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) D-dimer incidence chemotherapy related adverse event . II . To evaluate correlation pre-treatment telomere length , level biomarkers age ( IL6 , CRP , D-dimer ) , rate adverse event FOLFOX-based chemotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo blood sample collection analysis via real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) baseline , 3 month , 6 month . After completion study , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
