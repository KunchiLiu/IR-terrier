	<brief_summary>Background : - Cardiometabolic diseases combination medical disorder , occur together , increase risk heart disease diabetes . Researchers want learn relationship diseases inflammation ( redness , swell , pain ) . Inflammation affect entire body . Researchers study relationship people heart disease diabetes , compare healthy people . Objectives : - To learn link inflammation cardiometabolic disease . Eligibility : - Adults 18 year age old heart disease diabetes . - Healthy volunteer 18 year age old . Design : - Participants six study visit . There first visit , optional visit 12 month first visit . - At study visit : - Blood take needle arm . - An electrocardiogram . Small patch stick chest limb . A machine measure electrical signal heart . - Completed number questionnaire . - A body scan call FDG PET/CT . A substance inject tube arm . They lie special bed move PET/CT scanner . The PET/CT scanner take picture body . The scan last 30 minute . - Some participant body scan ( FDG PET/MRI ) . The procedure similar FDG PET/CT scan . These scan last 30 minute total . - Some participant also CT scan heart . A substance inject tube arm . They lie table large , donut-shaped machine . An X-ray tube move around body , take many picture . This procedure last 2 hour . - Some participant test measure blood pressure blood move body . - Some participant small sample skin fat tissue take .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over past two decade , number subject cardiometabolic disease ( CMD ) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , dyslipidemia , insulin resistance diabetes rise . Characterizing disease state reveal inflammation common feature CMD ; however , mechanistic link inflammation disease state human remain poorly understood . In protocol , aim characterize inflammation within blood vessel , blood , fat skin diabetes coronary artery disease compare without disease . We hypothesize diabetes coronary disease systemic inflammatory state provide important frame reference parameter find novel image technique another ongoing protocol try understand skin inflammation affect risk CMD CVD ( 13-H-0065 ) .</detailed_description>
