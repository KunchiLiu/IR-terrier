	<brief_summary>Task-oriented exercise combine strengthen show effective improve walk function patient chronic stroke . However , similar approach therapeutic exercise apply subacute stroke long-term follow-up , use outcome measure across three level function ( body functions/structure , activity , participation ) International Classification Functioning , Disability , Health ( ICF ) model . Therefore , study conduct fulfill three purpose : 1 . To investigate long-term effect four-week task-oriented low extremity strengthen training ( TOLEST ) program patient subacute stroke ; 2 . To investigate interrelationship among functional connectivity brain , low extremity motor function , physical activity level , quality life patient stroke receive four-week TOLEST program subacute phase stroke ; 3 . To identify prognostic factor recovery functional connectivity brain , low extremity motor function , physical activity level , quality life patient stroke receive four-week TOLEST program subacute phase stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct meta-analysis examine effect task-oriented approach patient sub-acute stroke preliminary study assessor-blind randomize control trial total 3 patient sub-acute stroke ( experimental group : E1 ; control group : C1 C2 ) . The participant randomly assign experimental group control group . All participant receive 4 week exercise training , 4 session per week 60 minute session . The experimental group receive task-oriented circuit training improve low extremity motor function . The control group receive stretch exercise upper extremity activity sit posture . Both group receive clinical asessments low extremity motor function ( primary outcome ) , structural integrity CST use diffusion spectrum imaging , cortical activation pattern SMC use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( secondary outcome ) baseline , post-training ( week 4 ) , 1 month follow-up ( week 8 ) . Because small number subject , also include one subject ( E2 ) receive train program experimental group pilot study one subject train group result . Training effect descriptively analyze individual subject . The meta-analysis result show task-oriented training lead significantly great improvement train 6-minute walking distance ( mean difference = 82.49 meter ; 95 % confidence interval : 27.59-137.38 ) comfortable gait speed ( standardized mean difference = 0.27 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.03-0.52 ) patient subacute stroke . Our preliminary result show experimental group achieve meaningful improvement primary outcome control group . In addition , different brain reorganization pattern observe two group . The result meta-analysis provide relevant clinical evidence effect task-oriented train low extremity motor function , preliminary study provide pilot result effect task-oriented circuit train low extremity motor function , brain structural functional plasticity patient sub-acute stroke .</detailed_description>
