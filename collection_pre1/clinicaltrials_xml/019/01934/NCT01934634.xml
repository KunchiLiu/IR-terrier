	<brief_title>Phase I Trial LCL161 Gemcitabine Plus Nab-Paclitaxel Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improved therapeutic option advance pancreatic adenocarcinoma treatment need continue investigate . Since 1997 , gemcitabine agent choice first-line therapy advance pancreatic cancer , median survival 5.7 month , 20 % 1-year survival ( Eli Lilly 1996 ) . Combination therapy use gemcitabine backbone investigate , none superior gemcitabine monotherapy , except modest increase overall survival ( OS ) erlotinib gemcitabine ( Moore et al 2007 ) . In study FOLFIRINOX compare gemcitabine first-line therapy 342 metastatic pancreatic cancer patient , median OS 11.1 month FOLFIRINOX group 6.8 month gemcitabine group ; however , FOLFIRINOX group experience adverse event particularly febrile neutropenia ( Conroy et al 2011 ) . LCL161 biostable , cell-permeable , small molecular weight Smac-mimetic compound . It orally bioavailable pan-IAP inhibitor demonstrate anti-tumor efficacy single agent small subset cell line , many cell line xenograft model give combination paclitaxel . Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel ( nab-paclitaxel ) formulation readily soluble saline , eliminate need lipid-based solvent ( ie , Cremophor EL ) corticosteroid antihistamine premedications hypersensitivity reaction require traditional unbound paclitaxel . nab-paclitaxel also show actively bind secreted protein acidic rich cysteine ( SPARC ) tumor stroma , highly express pancreatic cancer actively bind albumin nab-paclitaxel concentrate drug tumor . SPARC expression stroma tumor cell associate poor survival . In Phase I/II trial ( Von Hoff et al 2011 ) involve 67 patient metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma , regimen nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine tolerable adverse effect substantial antitumor activity , warrant Phase III evaluation . The Phase III study ( MPACT ) large , international study determine survival nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine superior gemcitabine alone . nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine new standard treatment patient metastatic pancreatic cancer ( Von Hoff et al 2013 ) . However , although study show promise substantially improve OS patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma , insensitivity agent likely occur due resistance apoptosis , observed laboratory study occur cytotoxic agent use treat pancreatic cancer past ( Westphal Kaltoff 2003 ) . Exploitation apoptosis pathway may ultimately provide effective , less toxic anticancer therapy selectively circumvent treatment-resistant pathway . Based , high likelihood LCL161 combination nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine determine safe well tolerate , show substantial antitumor activity , warrant Phase II evaluation . Up 24 patient enrolled Part A - Phase I Safety study . If combination therapy determine safe well tolerate show substantial antitumor activity , safety expansion cohort 12 additional patient enrol Part B - Efficacy study confirm tolerability efficacy LCL161 endpoint complete response ( CR ) .</detailed_description>
