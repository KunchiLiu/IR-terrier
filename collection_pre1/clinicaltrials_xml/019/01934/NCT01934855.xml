	<brief_title>Tumor Motion Management Radiotherapy Using 4D-MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiration-induced patient motion become major obstacle achieve high-precision radiotherapy cancer especially thorax upper abdomen . As target continuously move , additional margin add clinical target volume compensate uncertainty tumor organ motion , cause toxicity normal tissue limit dose deliver target . To account tumor motion , surrogate track method commonly use clinic radiotherapy . However , relationship surrogate tumor motion hard generalize depend individual patient , tumor location , treatment fraction , sometimes show complex pattern transient , unpredictable change . Hence , urgent need good scrutinize current surrogate-based motion management strategy . Moreover , robust motion management strategy give patient determine pre-treatment setting investigator currently lack sufficient tool provide information . 4D-CT typically used characterize tumor motion course radiotherapy . However , 4D-CT oversimplify snapshot representation single-breathing cycle low soft tissue contrast impart considerable amount radiation dose patient . Consequently , limitation 4D-CT prevent applicability acquire information timescales represent treatment session . MRI highly advantageous non-ionizing provide excellent soft tissue contrast . Although real-time 3D dynamic MRI limit low image quality temporal resolution , 2D dynamic MRI technique high fidelity spatio-temporal resolution requisite real-time track move target . Furthermore , respiration-correlated 4D-MRI reconstruct multi-slice 2D dynamic MR image , enable volumetric image processing analysis . Therefore , 4D-MRI attractive solution address breathe motion tumor track obstacle radiotherapy . The main goal research characterize patient-specific respiration-induced tumor surrogate motion evaluate accuracy effectiveness surrogate-based motion management strategy currently use clinic . Specifically , investigator hypothesize dynamic MRI obtain temporal duration consistent radiotherapy treatment provide spatio-temporal information tumor surrogate , therefore serve mean assess quality tumor motion track surrogate . To test hypothesis , investigator specifically propose 1 ) track characterize tumor surrogate motion 4D-MRI 2 ) evaluate surrogate-based motion track cohort patient thoracic tumor . External internal surrogate-based strategy commonly use clinic appropriately validate . With increase adaptation surrogate method motion management , propose research address urgent issue clinical radiotherapy provide mean achieve patient-specific motion management .</detailed_description>
