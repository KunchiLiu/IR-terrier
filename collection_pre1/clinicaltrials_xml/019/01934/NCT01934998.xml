	<brief_summary>The spinocerebellar ataxia ( SCAs ) genetically heterogeneous group dominantly inherit progressive ataxia disorder . More 30 different gene locus identify far . The common SCAs , together account half affected family , SCA1 , SCA2 , SCA3 , SCA6 . Each disorder cause translated CAG repeat expansion mutation . SCA1 , SCA2 , SCA3 usually onset 30 40 , SCA6 usually begin age 50 60 . In addition progressive ataxia , SCA1 , SCA2 , SCA3 frequently present additional non-ataxic symptom , include parkinsonism . Carbidopa/levodopa find good therapeutic effect parkinsonism . The SCA6 use consider pure cerebellar disorder . However , recent large study natural history SCAs find patient SCA6 often nonataxia symptom , observation challenge view SCA6 purely cerebellar disorder . Parkinsonism SCA6 rarely report , except case serial , small size study Korean patient . Dopamine transporter ( DAT ) reliable dopaminergic neuronal marker . Reduction DAT density detect I123 SPECT DaTscanTM dopaminergic neuron terminal striatum report one small size study consist eight SCA6 patient Korea . There also PET study use different radioligand DAT small group SCA6 patient Germany , find sub-clinical change DAT density patient SCA6 . There study far US parkinsonism non-ataxia spectrum striatal dopaminergic damage SCA6 , probably non-ataxia feature SCA6 n't receive much attention , also DaTscanTM n't clinically available US recently . The two publish study SCA6 DAT Korea Germany , small subject size . There treatment available SCA6 far . Our hypothesis parkinsonism non-ataxia spectrum striatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration part SCA6 disease spectrum .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specifically , would expect see 1 . Parkinsonism non-ataxia symptom commonly present SCA6 patient use think . 2 . Parkinsonism associate loss DAT striatum . 3 . Parkinsonism non-ataxia symptom also associate expand allele repeat number , disease duration , severity ataxia , addition DAT loss .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 year old old progressive ataxia positive genetic test SCA6 recruit . Those take medication know affect DAT binding , Ritalin , Cocaine , Adderall exclude . Those take SSRIs depression ask stop medication least 24 hour DaTscanTM . All study patient decision make capability understand study requirement consent . The agematched control likely patient ' spouse . However friends family member may also serve control need . Control subject ataxia , parkinsonism , myoclonus focal neurological symptom deficit . Subjects n't meet inclusion criterion .</criteria>
