	<brief_title>Zinc HIV Disease Among Alcohol Users - RCT Russia ARCH Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination heavy alcohol consumption HIV infection associate increased mortality , HIV disease progression , acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) proinflammatory state characterize increase biomarker level inflammation . Heavy alcohol use HIV infection cause microbial translocation , process bacterial product gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract leak across GI membrane portal circulation . Microbial translocation cause immune activation lead end organ damage . Alcohol cause microbial translocation via zinc deficiency . Zinc deficiency common among HIV-infected heavy drinker link high mortality rate . Zinc supplementation affordable , available , interfere ART , minimal adverse drug reaction . In animal model zinc reduces ethanol associate microbial translocation . In human study zinc slow HIV disease progression reduce level inflammatory biomarkers strongly link mortality . Given zinc 's potential efficacy propose conduct Zinc INflammation Chronic disease HIV ( ZINC HIV ) , double-blinded randomize controlled trial ass efficacy zinc supplementation vs. placebo among 250 HIV+ Russians , ART-naive enrollment recent history heavy drinking . We recruit participant Russia cohort within Uganda Russia Boston Alcohol Network Alcohol Research Collaboration HIV/AIDS ( URBAN ARCH ) Consortium study . Our specific aim test efficacy zinc supplementation , compare placebo ( 1 ) improve marker mortality measure VACS index ; ( 2 ) slow HIV disease progression measure CD4 cell count ; ( 3 ) improve marker AMI risk measure Reynolds risk score ; ( 4 ) low level microbial translocation inflammation measure serum biomarkers . We hypothesize compare placebo , patient receive zinc supplementation significantly low AMI mortality risk measure VACS index Reynolds risk score ; high CD4 cell count ; low level biomarkers microbial translocation inflammation . Importantly , hypotheses true , zinc supplementation could ultimately become standard adjunctive therapy complement alcohol intervention among HIV-infected person even resource limited environment . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE : The combination heavy alcohol consumption HIV infection result serious health problem increase risk death . Although exactly clear alcohol HIV , inflammation appear play important role . Zinc supplementation anti-inflammatory property . This study design see give zinc supplementation HIV infect people heavy drinker reduces risk serious health problem death .</detailed_description>
