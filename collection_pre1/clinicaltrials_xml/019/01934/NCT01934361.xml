	<brief_summary>This multi-center , phase Ib/ II study ( two part ) patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . The first part ( phase Ib ) investigate maximum tolerate dose/Recommended phase dose ( MTD/RP2D ) daily buparlisib combination every-three-week carboplatin buparlisib daily combination every-six-week lomustine ( CCNU ) use Bayesian model . Once MTD/ RP2D establish either 2 arm , correspond phase II portion study start . Phase II ass treatment effect buparlisib combination carboplatin term Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) compare treatment effect buparlisib lomustine versus lomustine plus placebo term PFS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib/II Study Buparlisib Plus Carboplatin Lomustine Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A preliminary assessment combination ( buparlisib plus carboplatin lomustine ) demonstrate enough antitumor activity compare historical data single agent carboplatin lomustine . Based overall safety profile , preliminary anti-tumor activity observe study , Novartis decide additional patient would enrol study . As consequence , Phase II part study conduct .</detailed_description>
