	<brief_summary>Proper growth child complex process regulate combination genetic , nutritional , environmental , hormonal , others . Growth hormone ( GH ) main hormone regulate growth childhood adulthood . Despite great progress field , development recombinant GH treatment growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) , still reliable method test GHD . Physical exertion one significant physiologic stimulus GH secretion , reliable test identification GHD . It use clinic complexity . Recently GH secretion follow short anaerobic exercise young adult test also demonstrate significant growth hormone secretion In contrast adult child 's exercise characterize anaerobic nature . There data secretion growth hormone response anaerobic exercise child . Purpose experiment : The purpose study evaluate secretion growth hormone response anaerobic exercise child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>40 child ( 20 boys 20 girl ) age 6-16 year , follow endocrinology unit short stature clinic need assessment growth hormone axis evaluate parallel accord currently accept pharmacological GH testing accept also follow anaerobic physical test . After explanation patient parent obtain informed consent , child instruct pedal maximum speed 15 second x 10 sprint ( 1 minute recovery sprint ) resistance adjust accord body mass index . The test perform similarity GH provocative protocol mean perform morning night 's sleep overnight fasting . The patient remain fasting test . They ask exercise day test . Thirty minute test , Venflon insert child receive explanation rest begin test . blood GH , IGF-1 , cortisol take begin exercise ( time 0 ) , end exercise , 30 minute , 45 minute 60 minute customary accord criterion set pharmacological inventory growth hormone . The test result compare pharmacological test child .</detailed_description>
