	<brief_summary>Antimicrobial penetration assess evaluation antimicrobial concentration various lung compartment , include bronchial mucosal tissue , epithelial lining fluid ( ELF ) , alveolar macrophage ( AM ) . Antimicrobial concentration determine ELF alveolar macrophage represent ideal estimate concentration site infection access via bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) . However sample antimicrobial concentration via BAL routine clinical practice due complex methodology poor patient tolerability . This study evaluate intrapulmonary plasma pharmacokinetics GSK2140944 single IV dose adult healthy volunteer . This Phase I , open-label study evaluate plasma pulmonary pharmacokinetics follow intravenous administration GSK2140944 healthy adult participant . Part A evaluate single dose PK profile . Part B optional conduct necessary . Each part consist maximum 6 cohort . In Part A , 4 6 cohort dose initially ; cohorts 5 6 optional dose additional time-points necessary adequately model pulmonary pharmacokinetic profile .</brief_summary>
