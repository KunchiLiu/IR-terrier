	<brief_summary>Working hypothesis aim : Biotin conjugate covalently several protein use co-factor . Conjugation biotin non-targeted , unspecific protein ( e.g . immunoglobulin ) lead breakage immune tolerance formation anti-biotin antibody . Anti-biotin antibody find correlation progression present autoimmune disease . In research correlation immune response biotin formation autoimmune disease , study : A . Assessment possibility biotin elicit immune response involve developmental stage autoimmune disease . B . Assessment possibility anti-biotin antibody indicate developmental stage autoimmune disease therefore serve disease early stage marker . Methods : A . Patient recruitment . Gathering participant 's medical record blood sample . B . Records clinical biochemical measure . C. Serum patient test correlation biotin level , biotin bound antibodies anti-biotin antibody liver function test . D. Controlled test repeatedly inject mouse biotinilated self-antibodies . Level anti-biotin test influence mouse . E. Determination correlation biotinilated antibody anti-biotin antibody disease eruption severance autoimmune disease . Expected result : Serum biotin-protein level Anti biotin antibody level increase patient active autoimmune liver disease . Importance : The proof connection biotin-carrying immunoglobulin , anti biotin antibody autoimmune disease open new research direction possible factor cause autoimmune disease . Probable implication Medicine : Identification correlation reaction biotine autoimmune diseases enable usage biomarkers autoimmune disease , severity disease personalization treatment .</brief_summary>
