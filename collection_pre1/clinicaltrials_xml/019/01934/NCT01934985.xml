	<brief_summary>The investigator propose 4 year prospective , observational study 40 patient yearly , compare conventional clinically indicated SPECT PET perfusion dynamic rest/stress MPI study coronary angiography , case perform quantitative coronary anatomy flow well quantitative 13N-ammonia PET MPI . Methods also assess ability determine myocardial viability compare regional wall motion ( WM ) clinically indicate serial ventriculography , echocardiography gate SPECT MPI protocol patient WM abnormality subsequently undergo revascularization . Patient study begin first study year base method already develop integrate new advance become evident .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients clinically indicate stress MPI low pretest likelihood ( 0 15 % ) coronary disease base criterion Diamond Forrester . Patients already clinically indicated stress MPI last three year low likelihood active coronary disease significantly narrow coronary artery . Patients whose clinically indicated stress MPI demonstrate clear abnormality likely go SCA clinical indication . If , conventional dynamic MPI patient SCA , still follow event 3 year follow participation protocol . To avoid delay unnecessary procedure among patient Group II dynamic image protocol study SCA , patient select protocol enlistment decision make patient 's physician , base totally clinical social factor , consider revascularization intervention would perform day diagnostic SCA perform electively , least 4 7 day later . Patients find SCA lesion `` borderline '' clinical significance , preferably absence associate lesion . Can give informed consent Unable unwilling return second stress image study Can cooperate adequate SPECT PET supine and/or prone image Pregnant female Patients 21 year old Active bronchospasm No theophylline 48 hour prior study Heart block severe Wenckebach block Patients uncomplicated infarction include exercise test later 8 week event vasodilator pharmacologic stress test least 24 hour event Coronary bypass surgery within 8 week Symptoms congestive heart failure rest Has event change drug regimen since initial stress test . Has serious response side effect initial clinical stress test induce ST elevation , hypotension , prolong arrhythmia , bronchospasm . Has clinical event since last coronary angiogram , angioplasty , coronary surgery . Has 201Tl rest SPECT MPI prior dynamic imaging</criteria>
