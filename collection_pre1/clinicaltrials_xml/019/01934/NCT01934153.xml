	<criteria>Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring ( include screen ECG screen Holter monitoring ) . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator considers find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Subjects significant lab value outside normal range always exclude enrolment . The subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction likely complete study plan . Subject willing provide inform consent . Axilla palm size must able accommodate one 40 centimeter square ( cm^2 ) templates , relevant cohort , protective device . Axilla palm must free tattoo , scar tissue tissue damage could affect drug absorption subject safety . Males 30 55 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) within range 1827 kilogram per meter square ( kg/m^2 ) ( inclusive ) . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method list Protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication followup visit . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) bilirubin &lt; =1.5xupper limit normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Corrected QT interval use Fridericia formula ( QTcF ) &lt; 450 msec ; QTcF &lt; 480 millisecond ( msec ) subject Bundle Branch Block Subject mentally legally incapacitate . History current significant medical illness include cardiovascular thrombotic event , myocardial infarction , stroke cardiac disease , hypertension , peptic ulcer disease gastrointestinal bleeding , skin disorder , hematological disease , bronchospastic respiratory disease , asthma , diabetes mellitus , renal hepatic insufficiency , illness investigator deem clinically significant exclusion subject study . Diagnosis narrowangle glaucoma , prostatic hypertrophy bladder neck obstruction opinion study investigator GSK medical monitor would prevent use anticholinergic therefore study participation . A mean QTcF value screen &gt; 450msec , QTcF 3 screen ECGs within 10 % mean , ECG suitable QT measurement ( e.g . poorly define termination T wave ) . A history elevate rest blood pressure mean blood pressure equal high 139/89 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) screen prior dosing . A mean heart rate outside range 40100 beat per minute ( bpm ) screen prior dosing . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug significant allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Unable unwilling avoid use underarm deodorant topical creams/lotions etc . axilla palm ( depend subject 's cohort ) admission Day 1 discharge unit ( note wash soap water permit daily basis topical agent remove application site ) . The radiation exposure previous 3 year period 10 millisievert ( mSv ) subject expose ionize radiation background level result work radiation Category A ( classify ) worker result research study may involve . An occupation require monitor radiation exposure , nuclear medicine procedure excessive xrays within past 12 month . Participation clinical trial involve administration 14Clabelled compound ( ) within last 12 month . Each subject 's previous effective dose review medical investigator ensure risk contamination / carryover current study . Subjects received total body radiation dose great 0.7 mSv exposure significant radiation ( e.g . compute tomography [ CT ] scan ) diagnostic reason ( except dental Xrays plain Xrays thorax bony skeleton ( exclude spinal column ) work participation medical trial previous year . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 60 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen A positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody . History smoke &gt; = 5 cigarettes/day within last year smoker unwilling unable refrain smoke participate clinical trial . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study . Unable refrain consumption red wine , Seville oranges , kumquat , satsuma , ugli , tangerine , tangelo , sprite , cassis , grapefruit grapefruit juice and/or pummelo , citrus fruit , grapefruit hybrid fruit juice contain product 7 day prior first dose study medication . Unable refrain use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( available , whichever long ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 milliliter ( mL ) within 60 day period . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia .</criteria>
