	<brief_summary>The hypothesis treatment low back pain ( LBP ) radiate leg , long term result prolotherapy effective current conventional treatment : epidural steroid injection ( ESI ) . This research examine efficacy prolotherapy injection versus epidural steroid injection treatment low back pain radiating leg . This randomized , unblinded study , patient see principle investigator 's pain clinic randomly divide receive treatment either experimental , prolotherapy group , active control , ESI group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prolotherapy Versus Epidural Steroid Injections ( ESI ) Lumbar Pain Radiating Leg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal study investigate long term efficacy prolotherapy patient LBP refer leg . The secondary goal compare efficacy epidural steroid . The reason explore option ESI latter prove disappointing . Comprehensive review write interlaminar transforaminal epidural basically show poor long term result longer 3 month . In addition , ESI carry risk neurological damage , epidural hematoma infection . However , ESI continue widely use treatment worldwide . Research also show increase age , increase incidence ligament laxity , spondylolisthesis angulation may turn lead nerve impingement deterioration function time . Sprained strained ligament capable refer pain leg even far ankle . Research show much pain refer leg impinge nerve root soft tissue , mention ligament ; must address treated treat pain order improve function . The term prolotherapy otherwise know proliferative regeneration therapy aim opposite cortisone , namely , strengthen structure inject , usually ligament . Prolotherapy solution also use treat partially torn tendon , case partial rotator cuff tear . Research prolotherapy show treatment mode produce vary result treatment low back pain carry few risk epidural . One infer may provide safe good long term treatment method ESI . Yelland 's review show prolotherapy work treatment LBP treatment method combine measure exercise manipulation . In study , patient low back pain radiating leg randomize receive either epidural steroid injection prolotherapy injection use solution make 20 % dextrose . In light result research quote , decide give exercise instruction tailor every patient 's condition . Both patient experimental control group receive instruction order avoid presence another confound variable . A precondition include trial either CT MRI lumbar spine within previous 18 month exclusion criterion sit . Once included trial patient randomize study control group . All epidural injection perform fluoroscopy , radiocontrast dye inject verify injectate give correct place . Patients group receive 3 interlaminar epidural steroid injection approximately 4 week apart . The solution inject make 80mg methylprednisolone acetate bupivicaine . The level inject depend clinical picture . All prolotherapy dextrose injection perform ultrasound guidance . Prolotherapy patient receive 5 session approximately 4 week apart . In session , 6 injection different area lumbosacral spine , sacroiliac ligament inject 20 % dextrose solution use 25 gauge needle . The targeted structure include follow : facet joint capsular ligament , interspinous ligament , sacroiliac ligament , depend clinical assessment . The clinical picture determine level inject session . As described , patient assess prior study study regard pain function .</detailed_description>
