	<brief_summary>Individuals bipolar suffer problem basic cognitive skill memory concentration . Unfortunately , current treatment show improve cognitive skill among individual bipolar disorder . Computerized cognitive remediation ( CR ) treatment show improve cognitive skill among individual serious mental illness bipolar disorder , schizophrenia . This treatment involve complete series activity computer show improve cognitive skill . D-cycloserine ( DCS ) antibiotic traditionally use treatment tuberculosis . Recent study suggest drug may also improve individual ' ability learn . Thus , goal study examine whether receipt d-cycloserine increase benefit individual receive participation cognitive remediation . To test hypothesis , approximately forty subject randomize one two study arm : [ ] CR + DCS [ ii ] CR + placebo . We examine whether d-cycloserine increase benefit individual bipolar disorder receive participation cognitive remediation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Cognitive Remediation D-cycloserine Individuals With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals bipolar disorder suffer broad array cognitive deficit may hinder ability achieve successful community functioning . Consequently , great attention recently direct toward development strategy ameliorate cognitive deficit . One strategy show successful endeavor cognitive remediation ( CR ) . This intervention , recognize `` best practice '' treatment serious mental illness , typically comprised series repeat exercise deliver clinician via computer design improve performance cognitive functioning . Yet , despite promise cognitive remediation , benefit intervention among individual bipolar disorder yet investigate . Recently , study demonstrate d-cycloserine ( DCS ) , N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) agonist , may facilitate learn process emotional non-emotional information human animal . These result raise possibility DCS may increase benefit associate receipt cognitive remediation among individual bipolar disorder . To date , unaware study examine whether concurrent receipt DCS may increase benefit produce cognitive remediation among individual severe mental illness . Thus , propose complete exploratory investigation augment cognitive remediation DCS among individual bipolar disorder . Approximately forty subject randomize one two study arm : [ ] CR + DCS ; [ ii ] CR + placebo . The primary outcome interest change cognitive function receipt cognitive remediation intervention . Secondary outcomes interest change symptomatology , social vocational functioning , performance task everyday living .</detailed_description>
