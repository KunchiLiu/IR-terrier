	<brief_summary>1 . Primary Objectives : - To characterize cardiometabolic risk factor profile patient enter cardiac rehab use traditional approach ( eg LDL-C ) well comprehensive panel cardiovascular metabolic biomarkers . It hypothesize comprehensive panel identify increase risk would detect use traditional approach . Specifically , hypothesize great percentage cohort identify `` high risk '' level LDL-P ( &gt; 1100 nmol/L ) and/or apoB ( &gt; 80 mg/dL ) LDL-C ( &gt; 100 mg/dL ) . It hypothesize prevalence elevate Lp ( ) elevate level inflammatory insulin resistance marker higher cohort compare population norm ( HDL , inc reference data ) . - To assess improvement laboratory lifestyle risk factor rate goal attainment completion rehab ( eg 3 month ) . This objective primarily descriptive , improvement traditional risk factor ( eg LDL-C ) compare exist publish data . Improvements non-traditional risk factor ( eg LDL-P , insulin resistance marker ) cardiac rehab population extensively investigate . - To determine attribute baseline best predict recurrent event re-hospitalizations assess one year later . 2 . Secondary/Developmental Objective : - To inform guide development subsequent study protocol design compare outcomes associate biomarker-guided personalize treatment plan vs. standard care cardiac rehab setting .</brief_summary>
