	<brief_summary>The purpose ISCHEMIA-CKD trial determine best management strategy patient stable ischemic heart disease ( SIHD ) , least moderate ischemia advance chronic kidney disease ( CKD ; estimate glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] &lt; 30 dialysis ) . This multicenter randomize control trial target randomization ~1000 patient advanced CKD least moderate ischemia stress test . Participants assign random routine invasive strategy ( INV ) cardiac catheterization ( cath ) follow revascularization plus optimal medical therapy ( OMT ) conservative strategy ( CON ) OMT , cath revascularization reserve fail OMT . The trial design run seamlessly parallel main ISCHEMIA trial companion ancillary trial . SPECIFIC AIMS A . Primary Aim . The primary aim ISCHEMIA-CKD trial determine whether invasive strategy routine early catheterization follow optimal revascularization , addition OMT , reduce primary composite endpoint death nonfatal myocardial infarction SIHD patient advance CKD least moderate ischemia average follow-up approximately 4 year compare initial conservative strategy OMT alone catheterization reserve fail OMT . The primary endpoint time centrally adjudicate death nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) . B . Secondary Aims . Major : To compare angina-related quality life INV CON strategy . Other secondary aim include : compare incidence composite cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , resuscitate cardiac arrest , hospitalization unstable angina heart failure ; composite cardiovascular death nonfatal myocardial infarction ; cardiovascular death ; non-fatal myocardial infarction ; all-cause death ; stroke ; hospitalization heart failure unstable angina Condition : Coronary Disease Procedure : Cardiac catheterization Phase : Phase III Condition : Cardiovascular Diseases Procedure : Angioplasty , Transluminal , Percutaneous Coronary , catheter-based intervention Phase : Phase III Condition : Heart Diseases Procedure : Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Phase : Phase III</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Among patient advanced CKD , cardiovascular disease lead cause death,15-30 time higher age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate general population . The projected 4-year mortality &gt; 50 % patient advanced CKD worse patient general population cancer , heart failure , stroke MI . Participants advance CKD 5-10 time likely die reach end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Despite , ~80 % contemporary coronary artery disease ( CAD ) trial exclude participant advance CKD . Most treatment aim reduce cardiovascular event advance CKD therefore extrapolate cohort without advanced CKD . Participants advance CKD cardiovascular disease undertreated less frequent use statins revascularization therapy , optimal management approach patient unknown . Participants advance CKD notably underrepresented contemporary trial compare revascularization medical therapy SIHD patient , Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes ( BARI 2D ) trial Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization Aggressive Drug Evaluation ( COURAGE ) trial , make assessment efficacy revascularization plus medical therapy vs. initial medical therapy alone cohort problematic . Participants advance CKD increase risk complication assign invasive procedure , specifically contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , dialysis , major bleed short-term risk death . However , controversy medical literature regard incidence ( &lt; 1 % &gt; 30 % ) , effective treatment ( saline hydration , N-acetyl cysteine , sodium bicarbonate ) prognosis contrast induce AKI ( &lt; 0.5 % &gt; 5 % require dialysis ) . In addition although contrast induced AKI associate increase short-term mortality residual confounding study make interpretation difficulty . Moreover unknown short-term increased risk offset long-term benefit . Limited observational study CKD cohort suggest survival benefit revascularization compare medical therapy alone long-term , despite increase short-term risk . However , medical therapy trial optimize , drug elute stent rarely use undoubtedly inherent selection ascertainment bias observational study . The resulted substantial clinical equipoise management patient rate revascularization around 10-45 % . The result ISCHEMIA-CKD profound implication guideline , health policy , clinical practice .</detailed_description>
