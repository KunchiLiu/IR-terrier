	<brief_summary>Bacterial resistance antimicrobial increase problem . Doctors occasionally face genuine therapeutic dead-ends , attempt cure nosocomial infection , frequently , community-acquired infection . Mastering antimicrobial resistance diffusion nowadays major Public Health issue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Digestive Carriage Integrons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Struggling bacterial resistance antimicrobial lay three main measure : - individual collective hygiene . - proper antibiotic practice , could help reduce antibiotic selective pressure . - well understanding bacterial resistance mechanism resistance gene transfer bacteria . Integrons , gene capture expression system , recognise major player resistance gene transfer , account great part resistance emergence dissemination . Integrons typically describe Gram negative bacteria , isolated man , environmental setting animal . They encode resistance nearly every class antimicrobial . A strong link integrons resistance multiple antibiotic compound describe integron detection relevant indicator resistance multiple antibiotic . The investigator project offer study impact antibiotic frequency integron intestinal carriage Limousin region genetic community two group . This study use innovative real-time PCR technique detect integrons directly sample without use traditional culture-based technique . The investigator hope detect new integron-carriers , notably patient integrons bear non poorly cultivable bacteria . Stool sample take two group subject : 246 intensive-care unit patient high antibiotic selective pressure , compare 246 healthy individual representative community , usual selective pressure . In group , antibiotic consumption fully document .</detailed_description>
