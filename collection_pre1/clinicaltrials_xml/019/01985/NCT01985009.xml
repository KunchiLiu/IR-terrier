	<brief_summary>The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) represent common cause liver disease western world . It progress steatosis non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , onto cirrhosis concomitant risk develop hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The prevalence hepatic steatosis high , range 16 31 % general population , 80 % obese populationand 96 % severely obese patient . Liver biopsy ( LB ) traditionally regard gold standard assessment patient NAFLD , although several limitation . LB potential sampling error , invasive often painful procedure . The natural history patient NAFLD generally determine extent liver fibrosis , hence non-invasive assessment fibrosis FibroScan® often sufficient . For patient proven NASH , change hepatic steatosis serum ALT level may provide information patient 's course and/or response treatment . Several clinical study show benefit measure hepatic stiffness FibroScan® machine use M+ probe . The ability identify significant fibrosis cirrhosis demonstrate normal overweight patient affect chronic hepatitis B C , biliary disease , alcohol relate liver disease ( ALD ) NAFLD . Recently , Echosens also develop novel ultrasonic control attenuation parameter ( CAP ) design quantify hepatic steatosis use process base vibration control transient elastography ( VCTE™ ) . Studies compare CAP liver biopsy multi-aetiology case patient Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) show good correlation steatosis assess histologically use CAP . The main objective prospective study evaluate diagnosis accuracy Controlled attenuation Parameter ( CAP ) measure FibroScan® ( either M+ XL+ ) patient NAFLD ass liver steatosis use biopsy reference . The study involve adult ' patient suspect NAFLD schedule liver biopsy within 2 week fibroscan examination follow Hepatology service four center United Kingdom . Approximately 450 patient ( 350 evaluable ) enrol study : Around 100 patient measure M+ probe around 250 XL+ probe . The inclusion period 18 24 month . Starting date : January 2014 . End recruitment : June 2017 . The duration study patient 1 7 day , depend exam calendar .</brief_summary>
