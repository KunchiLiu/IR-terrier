	<detailed_description>Mortality lose follow-up ( LTFU ) rate amongst adult African HIV-infected patient antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) high , especially first 12 month treatment . Although risk factor death LTFU patient elucidate , specific care intervention reduce death LTFU report . Therefore , urgent need evidence-based knowledge care intervention reduce early mortality LTFU HIV-infected patient ART sub-Saharan Africa . By inform decision-making process resource allocation , treatment care emphasis-areas planned strategy , knowledge would provide treatment program great opportunity lower HIV-related mortality increase benefit ART . The USAID-AMPATH Partnership ( AMPATH ) enrol &gt; 118,000 HIV-infected patient across 60 urban rural care sit western Kenya , &gt; 65,000 initiated ART . To date , &gt; 9,000 patient confirm dead , half ART . Many LTFU , unknown whether still alive . AMPATH uniquely place perform care intervention trial target reduction mortality LTFU : 1 . There sufficient study subject ; 2 . It protocol-driven care program enable establishment control group care standard fashion ; 3 . The AMPATH Medical Record System ( AMRS ) , fully computerized system contain &gt; 80 million observation collect prospectively &gt; 3.0 million visit provide easy data storage retrieval ; 4 . Experienced investigator Moi Indiana University Schools Medicine World Bank ensure study execute within acceptable clinical trial standard timely fashion ; 5 . It effective community outreach program increase chance study 's acceptability community , hence success . We propose perform randomize clinical trial compare effectiveness home-based modify directly observed ART treatment strategy clinic-based standard care reduce mortality LTFU soon ART initiate . A similar cadre clinician use home-based clinic-based care order enhance comparability outcomes . A cost effectiveness analysis intervention perform . The patient ' quality life perceive HIV stigma assess study enrollment , 24 48 week . We perform study two remote AMPATH care sit high HIV-prevalence hope study 's result , positive , impact care community need . 2 . Specific Aims High mortality LTFU rate soon HIV-infected patient initiate ART two major challenge face HIV treatment care program sub-Saharan Africa . In first year ART , mortality African patient high 26 % despite appropriate treatment . The majority death occur first six month . This mortality rate 5 - 8 time high similar patient develop world . The risk factor mortality African patient initiate ART well elucidate . These risk factor include : late patient presentation severe immune degradation clinically advance HIV disease ; active latent infection tuberculosis , invasive bacterial fungal ; anaemia ; malnutrition ; care low level fee-for-service center ; male gender ; poor adherence ART . Similarly , LTFU rate high . Some care program report LTFU rate high 40 % first 12 month ART . The risk factor LTFU also report mirror death . Recently publish data indicate unreported death might big reason LTFU . With abundant knowledge risk factor death LTFU ART initiation , require development , implementation evaluation novel treatment care strategy target specific risk factor aim mitigate twin challenge . The United States Agency International Development - Academic Model Providing Access Healthcare ( USAID-AMPATH Partnership ) one large public HIV treatment care program sub-Saharan Africa . With care center Western , Nyanza North Rift Valley province Kenya , AMPATH enrol 118,000 HIV-infected patient 60 urban rural care site . Of patient , &gt; 65,000 initiated ART . To date , 9,000 &gt; 118,000 AMPATH-enrolled HIV-infected patient confirm dead , include 5,000 ART . Current AMPATH 's annual LTFU rate estimate 8 % patient ART 13 % ART . AMPATH 's long-term objective improve ART outcomes HIV-infected African patient development replicable , sustainable , cost-effective treatment care strategy prevent mortality prolong survival . Through propose research , would like study usefulness intensive , nurse-directed , home-centered , modify ( three time per week ) treatment follow-up strategy newly enrol , HIV-infected , ART-naïve patient high risk die initiate ART . The central hypothesis application vast majority death HIV-infected African patient ART prevent early identification aggressive management HIV- ART-related complication close patient monitoring . The rationale behind proposal intervention interrupt early death HIV-infected patient ART likely succeed HIV ART-related complication identify early appropriate intervention institute promptly . Furthermore , solution HIV care treatment challenge sub-Saharan Africa likely attain research conduct address region 's specific healthcare need result research translate local practice . We plan accomplish objective pursuing follow three specific aim : 1 . To develop implement intensive , nurse-directed , home-centered , modify directly observed antiretroviral therapy ( M-DART ) care strategy high-risk HIV-infected patient initiate ART remote location western Kenya compare current AMPATH standard care ( High-Risk Express Care ) . - Hypothesis 1a : It feasible implement M-DART remote , poverty stricken , high-HIV prevalence rural community western Kenya . - Hypothesis 1b : M-DART effective strategy standard care ( High-Risk Express Care ) reduce mortality LTFU patient high risk die follow ART initiation . 2 . To determine cost effectiveness M-DART • Hypothesis 2 : M-DART cost effective 48-week study period 3 . To determine patient ' perception quality life stigma follow implementation M-DART . - Hypothesis 3a : Patients enrol M-DART high quality life score 24 48 week compare control patient . - Hypothesis 3b : Patients enrol M-DART low HIV related stigma score 24 48-weeks compare control patient .</detailed_description>
