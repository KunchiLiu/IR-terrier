	<brief_summary>Investigators hypothesize old HIV-infected individual ( i.e. , &gt; 50 year old ) efavirenz ( EFV ) -containing antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) significantly worse neurocognitive function old individual non-EFV-containing ART .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurocognitive Effects Tolerability Efavirenz Aging HIV-infected Individuals ( `` SHAC Neuro Study '' )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With age HIV-infected population United States elsewhere , neurocognitive dysfunction likely become increasingly common problem . Older individual could increase risk efavirenz-associated adverse effect due impaired metabolism , increase drug-drug interaction , low physiologic reserve , data long-term safety efavirenz ( antiretrovirals ) old individual HIV . The Stanford HIV Aging Cohort ( SHAC ) ideal set study potential neurologic effect antiretrovirals age patient . SHAC ongoing longitudinal study initiate 2008 evaluate age virologically-suppressed HIV-infected individual . The cohort support multiple grant include grant State California 's HIV Research Program well NIH supplemental grant . As September 2013 , approximately 150 virologically-suppressed HIV-infected adult enrol . In addition enrol patient good adherence ART , cohort purposefully exclude subject active substance abuse , unstable medical condition , psychiatric illness limit potential confounding study end point . Recently , NIH supplemental grant ( AI069556 ) receive expand SHAC 300 HIV-infected subject . The median age subject cohort mid-50 's allow ample number old subject plan study .</detailed_description>
