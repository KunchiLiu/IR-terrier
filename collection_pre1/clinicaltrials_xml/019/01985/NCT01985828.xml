	<brief_summary>The primary objective study document effectiveness Cyberknife stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) treatment intermediate high-risk localized prostate cancer define biochemical Disease-Free Survival ( bDFS ) , use Phoenix American Society Therapeutic Radiation Oncology ( ASTRO ) definition , 5 year . During prostate-specific antigen era , ever-increasing percentage men prostate cancer present clinically localize , potentially curable disease . Although conventional treatment option potentially curative select patient , treatment also drawback , include risk negative long-term quality life consequence serious complication . The CyberKnife® system type radiation machine use special system precisely focus large dos x-rays tumor . The device design concentrate large dos radiation onto tumor injury radiation nearby normal tissue minimal . Intermediate risk patient treat either CyberKnife® Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) monotherapy CyberKnife® SBRT boost follow Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) . High risk patient treat CyberKnife® SBRT boost follow IMRT . Treatment last 4-7 day . Patients complete QOL questionnaires treatment . Questionnaires also complete follow-up visit 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 36 month every 12 month year 5 .</brief_summary>
