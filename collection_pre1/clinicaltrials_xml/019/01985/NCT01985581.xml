	<brief_title>Efficacy GXR Adjunctive Therapy With Psycho-stimulant Executive Function Children With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although stimulant medication show positive impact executive function ( EF ) ( Findling et al , 2009 ; Hale et al . 2011 ) , little documented effect INTUNIV extend release EF child . The manifestation clinical symptom relate impairment EF often lead search additional treatment option many case adjunct therapy traditional stimulant medication treatment regimen . Demonstrating addition INTUNIV extend release usual stimulant therapy effective symptom control well improve EF may influence clinical treatment algorithm need health care resource effectively manage patient . Since EF deficit negatively impact academic achievement behavior school child spend large number daytime hour school , concordance report improvement school home environment examine . Overall improvement quality life addition INTUNIV extend release also evaluate .</detailed_description>
