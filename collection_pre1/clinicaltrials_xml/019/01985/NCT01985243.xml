All households infant 0-12 mo age village invite enrolled . We continue enroll household reach sample size 1500 household . If necessary , expand number sampled community . 3 . All households adolescent 10-15 age village , part infant cohort , invite enrolled . We continue enroll household reach sample size 1500 household . Enrollment The survey carry one day community .
