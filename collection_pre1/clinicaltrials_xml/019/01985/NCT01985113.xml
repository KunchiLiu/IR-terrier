	<brief_summary>In pre-clinical study investigator find thioredoxin reductase activity serum harbour huge difference cancer patient non-cancer patient , enzyme activity elevate remarkably among cancer patient , investigator hypothesis due tumor cell load patient , enzyme activity may harbour huge difference carcinoma tissue para-carcinoma tissue early stag non-small cell lung cancer , surgery , enzyme activity may fall normal level remove tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This cooperative research project Thoracic Surgery Department Medical Oncology Department Affiliated Cancer Hospital xiangya School Medicine Central South University , State Key Laboratory Natural Medicine Biomimetic Drugs Perking University . The primary objective measure thioredoxin reductase activity use blood lung cancer tissue measure thioredoxin reductase messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) protein expression use lung cancer pericarcinomatous tissue early stag ( Ⅰ~ⅢA ) non-small lung cancer , study correlation thioredoxin reductase blood tissue . The secondary objective measure thioredoxin reductase activity non small lung cancer lung benign lesion patient identify difference tumor lung benign mass .</detailed_description>
