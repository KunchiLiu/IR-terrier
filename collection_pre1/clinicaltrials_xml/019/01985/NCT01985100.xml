	<brief_summary>To confirm refute recently publish data regard reduction post-stroke ischemic penumbra , use SPECT/CT , use precise tool PET/MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Hyperbaric Oxygen Increase Blood Supply Injured , But Still Alive Tissue , Around Old Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patient suffer acute ischemic stroke improve immediately ensue 30-90 day . However , many patient improve beyond initial period spite continue intensive physical therapy supportive care . A prospective , randomized trial use hyperbaric oxygen treatment 59 patient publish January 2012 . That study use 40 hyperbaric oxygen treatment , indicate significant clinical neurological improvement residual motor deficit patient sustain stroke year previously . An increase brain activity region immediately surround stroke ( penumbra ) report basis SPECT study . Regions live cell determine CT. Because SPECT primarily measure perfusion metabolic activity CT poor measure cell life , investigator plan assess area physiologic/anatomic mismatch similar patient follow hyperbaric oxygen treatment use appropriate precise tool , PET MRI .</detailed_description>
