	<brief_summary>Dyspnoea uncomfortable shortness breath debilitates million patient lung disease , heart failure cancer . It often difficult treat . The sensation dyspnoea process brain , believe psychological factor modify amplify sensation , frequently exacerbate symptom . This study aim identify importance learn brain mechanism dyspnoea investigate cohort patient chronic breathlessness undergo pulmonary rehabilitation . Pulmonary rehabilitation six-week course exercise , education group therapy improve dyspnoea improve lung function . This lead u hypothesise beneficial effect PR maybe due change brain processing , potentially relate learn effect . Therefore probe whether learn important beneficial effect pulmonary rehabilitation , intend modify learning drug d-cycloserine . D-cycloserine antibiotic enhances learn due effect N-methyl D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor hippocampus . Our previous study similar group patient demonstrate importance hippocampus breathlessness perception , wish investigate depth . The study involve collect physiological , psychological clinical measure conjunction brain scanning , , pulmonary rehabilitation . Subjects either receive d-cyloserine placebo first four pulmonary rehabilitation session .</brief_summary>

Any commonly accept contraindication MRI scanning , example , severe claustrophobia , presence metallic implant , pacemaker etc . Pregnancy . The risk foetus radiofrequency energy MRI scan unknown . Inadequate understanding verbal write information English , sufficient complete MRI safety screening . Unable lie flat still 1/2 hour Requirements oxygen therapy Significant cardiac , neurological , psychiatric metabolic disease Contraindications dcycloserine : Alcoholism , know hypersensitivity , severe renal failure Regular therapy prescribe opioid analgesic Antidepressant therapy ( may alter hippocampal plasticity ) Previous pulmonary rehabilitation ( learn may different repeat pulmonary rehabilitation treatment )</criteria>
