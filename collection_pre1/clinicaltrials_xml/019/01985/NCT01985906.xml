	<detailed_description>The traditional endovascular treatment aneurysm base utilization stent-grafts create mechanical barrier aneurysmal sac normal blood flow . Problems endoleak occlusion collateral artery impede application complex aneurysms adjacent involve vital branch . Advanced branched/fenestrated endografts apply many experienced center , application technique limit less-experienced center due complicate cumbersome nature procedure . The concept use bare metal stent occlude aneurysm firstly describe two decade ago . Geremia et al suggest metallic stent bridge saccular aneurysm would alter local flow pattern , promote thrombus formation , thereby lead aneurysm occlusion . Optimal flow modulation effect reach mean stent porosity 65 % . To achieve low mesh porosity maintain flexibility stent , investigator apply multiple stent overlap fashion . Computational simulation study demonstrate 3 4 bare metal stent deploy , mesh porosity could decrease effective value , slow flow velocity within sac . The use overlap stent report treatment peripheral aneurysm satisfactory clinical outcome . The primary purpose study evaluate safety , feasibility , efficacy multiple overlapping uncovered stent treat aortic aneurysm preserve major visceral branch , include celiac artery ( CA ) , superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) renal artery ( RA ) .</detailed_description>
