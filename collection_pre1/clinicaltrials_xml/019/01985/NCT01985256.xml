	<brief_summary>This multicenter study evaluate safety tolerability Toca 511 administer intravenously patient recurrent progressive Grade III Grade IV Gliomas elect undergo surgical removal tumor . Subjects meet inclusion none exclusion criterion receive portion total dose Toca 511 administer intravenous , bolus injection , follow approximately 11 day later remainder dose inject wall resection cavity time plan tumor resection . Approximately 6 week later , subject begin treatment oral Toca FC take every 8 hour 7 day , repeat every 4 week . All subject enrol study encourage participate continuation protocol enable additional 5-FC administration collection long-term safety response data .</brief_summary>
