	<brief_summary>Investigators propose study efficacy Bevacizumab plus systemic chemotherapy prior surgery order make locally advanced tumor operable . Treatment thus expect induce maximum tumor shrinkage within short period ( usually 3-6 month ) . In addition Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) administer early possible disease stage . The primary aim study evaluate preliminary antitumor activity term pathological complete response ( pCR ) bevacizumab combination chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Combination With Chemotherapy Neo-adjuvant Setting HER2 ( - ) Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim administer systemic therapy prior surgery make locally advanced tumor operable allow conservative surgery case T2-T3 tumor . Therefore , treatment expect induce maximum tumor shrinkage within short period . In addition base anti-angiogenic MoA , bevacizumab ( Avastin ) administer early possible disease stage . Bevacizumab already test neoadjuvant set encouraging result . In first trial patient inoperable locally advanced breast cancer receive docetaxel without bevacizumab five clinical Complete Responses 24 Partial Responses . In second trial also report result combination bevacizumab doxorubicin docetaxel treatment inflammatory breast cancer . Then , set study primary therapy explore activity different regimen confirm role baseline pathological feature tumor predict responsiveness primary therapy . A 22 % pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate achieve study combine bevacizumab together Xeloda Taxotere suggest bevacizumab addition chemotherapy neoadjuvant treatment feasible show promising activity unexpected toxicity report . Thus , high interest exists clinicians mostly within cooperative group cover large national oncology center involve run study .</detailed_description>
