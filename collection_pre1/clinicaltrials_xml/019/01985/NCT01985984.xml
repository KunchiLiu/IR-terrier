	<brief_title>Outcome Prediction Head &amp; Neck Cancer Patients After Radiotherapy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) , radiation therapy one mainstays therapy either definitive therapy alone combination systemic therapy follow surgical resection postoperative treatment . Nowadays 's great attention personalize medicine aim offer patient treatment best suit individual patient tumor characteristic . To apply personalized therapy , need accurate outcome prediction model disease control , treatment related toxicity quality life . The main factor use predictive/prognostic nomograms clinical factor , like patient- , tumor- treatment related factor ( 1 ) . Standard example include age , gender , co-morbidity , smoke history , hemoglobin level , tumor site , TNM stage , tumor volume , HPV-status , others . For larynx cancer nomogram make publicly available www.predictcancer.org . However , anticipate factor contribute ( improvement ) prediction model . These factor may include genomic analysis tumor specimen , quantitative image analysis ( radiomics ) , blood biomarkers , and/or tumor-tissue marker ( 2 ) . In addition , treatment-related parameter also need consider include factor like overall treatment time , use systemic therapy , prescribe radiation dose fraction dose . With new technique use EPID dosimetry , possible measure deliver radiation dose compare prescribe dose ( 3,4 ) . This offer potential apply Dose Guide RadioTherapy ( DGRT ) , especially HNSCC may large impact , anatomical change fractionate therapy know occur lead dose change target organ risk ( 5,6 ) . The final objective study integrate potential prognostic factor develop reliable nomograms tumor control well complication .</detailed_description>
