	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Daratumumab Patients With Multiple Myeloma Who Have Received Least 3 Prior Lines Therapy ( Including Proteasome Inhibitor PI Immunomodulatory Drug IMiD ) Are Double Refractory PI IMiD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) study daratumumab treatment participant multiple myeloma receive least 3 prior line therapy include PI IMiD whose disease double refractory PI IMiD . Up approximately 150 participant enrol . The study include screening , treatment , follow-up phase . Participants receive daratumumab intravenous infusion ( 28-day cycle ) disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , protocol-defined reason . For study drug administration , participant receive pre- post-infusion medication prevention infusion relate reaction . Follow-up continue death , loss follow , consent withdrawal study participation , study end , whichever occur first . The study consist 2 sequential part ( Part 1 Part 2 ) . The purpose Part 1 select dose schedule Part 2 study . Assessment tumor response disease progression conduct accord IMWG response criterion . Serial pharmacokinetic blood sample pharmacogenomic blood sample collect . Safety monitor throughout study .
