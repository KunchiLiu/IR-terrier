	<brief_summary>Disturbances hedonic motivational process play major role pathophysiology obesity . To date , experimental approach study emotional motivational processing rely subjective assessment scale . We therefore develop two novel computer-generated task challenge respectively visual temporal discrimination capacity quantitative objective measurement hedonic motivational state human . According task , subject ask view compare two stimulus , appetitive one ( food picture ) devalue counterpart ( food picture greyscale ) , trial , assess either size ( task A ) duration presentation ( task B ) . From consideration , present project aim use novel tool : ) ass hedonic motivational state subject obesity , ii ) compare responses healthy volunteer , iii ) establish relationship biological marker know highly involved regulation emotional motivational process , endocannabinoids . The present project demonstrate behavioral test validate laboratory relevant experimental tool diagnostic/clinical assessment phenotypic characterization obese patient . The application test therapeutic context could add information efficacy relevance choose therapy . Finally , project provide information biological substrates hedonic motivational impairment might become target therapy obesity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Disturbances hedonic motivational process play major role pathophysiology reward-related disease , obesity . To date , experimental approach study emotional motivational processing rely subjective assessment scale . We therefore developed validate novel computer-generated test challenge visual temporal discrimination capacity human . The subject ask view compare two stimulus , appetitive one ( food picture ; F ) devalue counterpart ( food picture greyscale ; D ) , trial , assess either size ( task A ) duration presentation ( task B ) . Geometric figure use control present color ( C ) greyscale ( D ) . Both task register French agency protection computer software . Here , propose use novel test : ) ass hedonic motivational state subject suffer obesity , ii ) compare responses healthy volunteer , iii ) establish relationship biological marker know highly involved regulation emotional motivational process , endocannabinoids . Responses test obese patient evaluate two separate experimental session either fast satiety condition . The present study expect begin mid-November 2013 total duration 24 consecutive month . A sample 25 patient suffer obesity recruit compare 25 healthy normal volunteer free previous current metabolic psychiatric disorder . They match age sex . They screen use `` Association pour la Méthodologie et la Documentation en Psychiatrie '' questionnaire obtain series information , comprise marital status , number child , number sibling , education training , professional qualification , significant life events… They evaluate Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview order determine presence mood disorder associate psychopathology . The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire employ measure three separate aspect eat behavior : cognitive restraint , uncontrolled eating , emotional eating . This complete Multidimensional Body Self-Relations Questionnaire State-Trait Anxiety Inventory order ass body satisfaction anxiety level , respectively . Beyond assessment , two separate experimental session conduct , one satiety fasting . During session , participant ask perform two validated instrumental task front screen computer . Plasma level endocannabinoids monitered collect blood sample prior consumption calorically-defined meal carry computer-generated task satiety . Blood withdraw time-points session fasting . Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) assess hunger level complete blood collect . A VAS also use global assessment appetitive property view food image end second experimental session .</detailed_description>
