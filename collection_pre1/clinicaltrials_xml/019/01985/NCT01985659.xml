	<brief_title>Nodal Upstaging VATS Anatomical Resections NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vats lobectomy become standard care early stage lung cancer . Several study show feasibility safety dedicate centre . Compared thoracotomy procedure believe achieve equal oncologic result survival , perhaps well . Publications show mediastianal lymph node dissection VATS similar . However , two recent report show potential low N1 ( hilar intrapulmonary ) upstage VATS surgery After optimal stag percentage unforeseen N+ percentage unforeseen positive node reach 15 % Nodal upstaging final pathology dependent quality : - pretreatment staging , good , less upstaging - surgery , ie mediastinal , hilar intrapulmonary lymphadenectomy - pathologic examination If accept pretreatment stag pathologic examination equal two comparable surgical cohort , find unforeseen N+ nodal upstage quality marker surgery . When surgical technique change , important look marker . In absence randomize trial , believe cohort analysis useful . By include patient , open vat , compare cohort instead surgical technique use , selection bias absent . We compare three cohort . In first ( 20007-2009 ) almost patient operated thoracotomy . In second cohort , ( 2010-2011 ) experience vat early . In third period ( 2012-2013 ) , standardized vat technique extensive intrapulmonary mediastinal lymphadenectomy use .</detailed_description>
