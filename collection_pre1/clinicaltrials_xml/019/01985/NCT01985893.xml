	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Lapatinib Plus Trastuzumab Lapatinib Plus Capecitabine Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , randomize , explorative phase II trial lapatinib plus trastuzumab lapatinib plus capecitabine patient HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer . The trial design obtain evidence wether chemotherapy-free combined HER2-directed therapy lapatinib trastuzumab provide similar efficacy establish combination lapatinib capecitabine favourable toxicity profile . This study also assess relationship anticipate anti-tumour activity treatment regimens biological characteristic subject ' tumour baseline . The purpose study estimate clinical benefit lapatinib plus trastuzumab compare lapatinib plus capecitabine measure investigator-assessed progression-free survival , tumour response overall survival . The purpose study ist - characterize safety tolerability lapatinib plus trastuzumab population . - identify predictor sensitivity lapatinib trastuzumab therapy . - compare difference health-related quality life ( HRQL ) pain symptoms patient treatment assignment .</detailed_description>
