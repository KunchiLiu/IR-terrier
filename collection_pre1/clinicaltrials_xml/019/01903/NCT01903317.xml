	<brief_title>Evaluation Vitamin D Levels Psoriasis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design Subjects recruit outpatient population subject psoriasis Dr. Jennifer Soung 's clinic Gottschalk Medical Plaza University California , Irvine . Subjects requisite diagnosis psoriasis start new form therapy candidate enrollment . Subjects choose participate study receive standard care treatment without monitor vitamin D level . The protocol study follow . Subjects screen consent . Upon entry study , study subject 's severity disease evaluate investigator , use Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) , Body Surface Area ( BSA ) , Physician 's Global Assessment ( PGA ) . These assessment repeat future study visit . Subjects receive whichever standard care treatment psoriasis participate study . Subjects disease severity evaluate vitamin D level drawn Baseline ( prior initiate treatment ) , Week 12 , Week 24 , Week 52 . Study Procedures : All study procedure take place UCI Dermatology Research Center Institute Clinical Translational Research ( ICTS ) locate 843 Health Sciences Road , Irvine , CA 92697 . The subject inform vitamin D level result time . Should level dangerously low ( per laboratory reference point ) , subject treat vitamin D deficiency necessary per standard care . Subjects categorize start topical therapy , phototherapy systemic therapy , biologic therapy . For Vitamin D level test protocol , Vitamin D 25-hydroxy level drawn , involve 0.5mL blood per draw . Screening Baseline : This visit take approximately 30 minute . Written informed consent must obtain prior performance protocol-specific procedure . The following procedure perform Screening : - Informed consent first Screening visit . - Subjects allocate sequential identification number . After assignment , subject include drop-outs account fully document withdrawal study completion . - Assessment psoriasis diagnosis confirmation inclusion exclusion criterion . - Review concomitant medication therapy - PASI , BSA , PGA assessment - Laboratory testing : Vitamin D level - Pregnancy assessment Week 12 : This visit take approximately 15 minute . - PASI , BSA , PGA assessment - Laboratory testing : Vitamin D level - Review concomitant medication therapy - Pregnancy assessment Week 24 : This visit take approximately 15 minute . - PASI , BSA , PGA assessment - Laboratory testing : Vitamin D level - Review concomitant medication therapy - Pregnancy assessment Week 52 : This visit take approximately 15 minute . - PASI , BSA , PGA assessment - Laboratory testing : Vitamin D level - Review concomitant medication therapy - Pregnancy assessment Further description study procedure Clinical Assessments : Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) The Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) quantify severity subject 's psoriasis base lesion severity percent body surface area ( BSA ) affect . PASI composite scoring investigator degree erythema , induration , scale ( score separately ) four body region , adjustment percent BSA involve body region proportion body region whole body . Body Surface Area ( BSA ) Assessment body surface area psoriasis perform separately four body region : head neck , upper limb , trunk ( include axillae groin ) , low limb ( include buttock ) . The percent surface area psoriasis estimate mean handprint method , full palmar hand subject . Physician 's Global Assessment ( PGA ) The Physician 's Global Assessment psoriasis score 5-point scale , reflect global consideration erythema , induration scale across psoriatic lesion . Average erythema , induration scaling score separately whole body accord 5-point severity scale ( 0 4 ) define morphologic descriptor . Clinical Laboratory Tests Blood sample collect timepoints indicate . All test perform UCI Pathology Services . Pregnancy Assessment Female subject child-bearing potential ask pregnant . As risk pregnant woman participate study minimal ( blood draw breach confidentiality ) , pregnancy test do . However , female subject declare pregnant , withdrawn study .</detailed_description>
