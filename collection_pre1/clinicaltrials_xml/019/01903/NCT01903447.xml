	<brief_summary>Internalizing psychopathology ( IPs ) involve depression anxiety among prevalent , costly disable illness . Treatments IPs available extent individual patient respond quite heterogeneous . Little information exists , particularly biological domain , help explain individual difference treatment response . IPs share similar pattern dysfunction within Fronto-Limbic Affect Regulation Emotional Salience ( FLARES ) brain circuit , two commonly use , 'gold standard ' treatment - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBTs ) - equally effective anxiety depressive disorder , appear change brain activity area within FLARES circuit . The overarch goal project delineate common versus specific FLARE brain target SSRI CBT identify specific aspect FLARE dysfunction might better predict response specific modality treatment . This experiment integrate emotion interaction cognition across several stage emotional experience , encompass study probe sensitivity acute potential threat automatic volitional form affect regulation relation FLARES brain network . We enroll 200 patient present Mood Anxiety Disorders Program seek treatment disable 'anxiety , worry , depress mood ' ( IPs , include characterize Not Otherwise Specified ) randomize 12-week course SSRI CBT . Dimensional , transdiagnostic negative valence system ( NVS ) construct , include FLARES function , measure treatment . Specifically , project examine 2 Specific Aims : 1 ) Where SSRI CBT treatment exert effect NVS construct ? ; 2 ) Which NVS construct predict likelihood success SSRI CBT treatment ? Such finding use guide right patient right treatment high likelihood success . They also elucidate pathophysiologically-driven mechanistic model treatment work brain thus hasten development new treatment target underlying pathophysiology across internalize condition .</brief_summary>
