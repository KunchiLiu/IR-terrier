	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label , randomize study evaluate efficacy safety Atezolizumab compare docetaxel participant advance metastatic non-small cell lung cancer platinum failure . Participants randomize receive either Atezolizumab 1200 milligram ( mg ) intravenously every 3 week docetaxel 75 milligram per meter square ( mg/m^2 ) intravenously every 3 week . Treatment Atezolizumab may continue long participant experience clinical benefit assess investigator , i.e. , absence unacceptable toxicity symptomatic deterioration attribute disease progression .</brief_summary>
