	<brief_summary>Trachoma lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) two 'Neglected Tropical Diseases ' ( NTDs ) , infectious disease affect million poor people country develop world . Trachoma eye infection lead painful scar eyelid blindness later life . LF lead swell usually limb ( elephantiasis ) . Trachoma LF preventable treatable disease . One important treatment strategy annual Mass Drug Administration ( MDA ) : Communities receive drug treatment year . Azithromycin give trachoma . Ivermectin albendazole give LF . Trachoma MDA LF MDA currently separate campaign . Combined MDA campaign trachoma LF , three drug would give one time , would reduce cost decrease burden health system . Before combined MDA three drug ( azithromycin , ivermectin albendazole ) could recommend , would demonstrate safety profile treatment three drug acceptable . An early study Mali 2010 ( AZIVAL ) compare standard MDA ( one week space two MDA campaign ) combine MDA ( trachoma LF MDA day ) show safety profile comparable ; result study statistically significant could use make official recommendation . The AZIVAL 2 study design answer question remain AZIVAL study perform Mali 2010 . If safety result AZIVAL 2 study acceptable , official recommendation combine MDA azithromycin , ivermectin albendazole draft . We conduct AZIVAL 2 study Mozambique . The target population ( inclusion exclusion criterion ) AZIVAL study Mali . Main criterion : Age ≥ 5 year ≤ 65 year , height ≥ 90 cm , female , pregnant breast-feeding . Important difference AZIVAL study AZIVAL 2 study ) small cluster sufficient power ( average household size 5 people ) , b ) placebo double-blind participant study staff azithromycin , c ) study area undergone few previous round MDA LF none trachoma , ) smartphones data entry .</brief_summary>
