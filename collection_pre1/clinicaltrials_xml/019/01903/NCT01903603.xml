	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Study Movement Participation Patients With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) may lead various motor deficit , influence activity participation . It would ideal characterize neural network motor control model patient CP underlies clinical behavior identifying alter neural network motor control associate behavioral improvement . The aim study investigate brain image motor control patient CP evaluate multimodal imaging study utilize multi-modal technique kinematic analysis . This study include prospective longitudinal study patient CP one-year . This study execute 3 phase within 3 year : 1st phase ( 1st year ) : establish multimodal brain image motor control , clinical outcome protocol prospective one-year follow-up study healthy subject ; 2nd phase ( 2nd year ) : establish brain image motor control , clinical outcome prospective one-year follow-up study old patient CP ; 3rd phase ( 3rd year ) : establish brain image motor control , clinical outcome prospective one-year follow-up study young patient CP . In prospective longitudinal study , participant receive 3-times measurement : beginning , 6 month later , one year first data collection point</detailed_description>
