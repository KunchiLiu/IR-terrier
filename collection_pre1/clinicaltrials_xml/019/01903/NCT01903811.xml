	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial compare well two different dos carfilzomib work give dexamethasone treat patient multiple myeloma come back period improvement respond treatment . Carfilzomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving carfilzomib together dexamethasone may kill cancer cell . It yet know whether high low dose carfilzomib work well give dexamethasone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate compare progression free survival ( PFS ) two different dos carfilzomib dexamethasone multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient relapse and/or refractory disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate compare response rate ( RR ) arm . II . To evaluate response rate ( RR ) patient relapse low dose carfilzomib subsequently cross-over high dose carfilzomib . III . To evaluate safety combination patient population . IV . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore molecular variability MM cell obtain extramedullary bone marrow relapse site . II . To explore role positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan assess disease burden tool assess treatment response . III . To explore change leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma treat low dose carfilzomib high dose carfilzomib plus dexamethasone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously ( IV ) low-dose carfilzomib IV 2-10 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Patients progression cross-over Arm II . ARM II : Patients receive dexamethasone IV high-dose carfilzomib IV 30 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Note first course treatment arm carfilzomib give reduced rate ass toxicity . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year initial registration .</detailed_description>
