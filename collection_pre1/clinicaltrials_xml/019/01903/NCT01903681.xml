	<brief_summary>There increase evidence chronic sleep disorder child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , Angelman Syndrome ( AS ) Smith-Magenis syndrome ( SMS ) associate disturbed melatonin secretion melatonin administration show effective population . For child difficulty swallow tablet , Neurim develop age-appropriate Melatonin formulation form mini-tablets dissolution profile Circadin速 tablet product , thus produce melatonin concentration-time profile effect . This study concern pharmacokinetic study . The purpose study : - Establish 24 hour baseline profile endogenous saliva melatonin concentration urine 6-SMT excretion child age 2 include 17 year neurodevelopmental disorder sleep disturbance . - Establish concentration-time profile saliva melatonin concentration 24 hour 6-SMT urine excretion 2 10 mg Circadin速 mini-tablets single dose administration child age 2 include 17 year neurodevelopmental disorder sleep disturbance . - Evaluate adverse event profile single dose 2 10 mg Circadin速 mini-tablets child age 2 include 17 year neurodevelopmental disorder sleep disturbance .</brief_summary>
