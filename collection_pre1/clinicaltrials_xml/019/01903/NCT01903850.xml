	<brief_title>TruFreezeâ„¢ Airway Obstruction : TAO STUDY</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center prospective feasibility study enroll 6 clinical site total 30 subject . Enrollment criterion include subject clinically significant benign malignant obstruction central airway , require treatment intervention candidate surgical resection . The central airway define include trachea , leave right main bronchus , bronchus intermedius right . Spray cryotherapy ( SCT ) use truFreeze system use conjunction mechanical intervention ( balloon/rigid dilation debridement tumor ) improve airway patency . Subjects receive 4 , 5-second spray cycle prior mechanical intervention ( balloon/rigid dilation debridement tumor ) , follow 4 , 5-second additional spray cycle immediately follow mechanical intervention . The degree airway narrow estimate treat physician treatment use grade scale . Digital endoscopic image obstruction take treatment , also assess neutral assessor blind treatment . Subjects contact Day 1 follow treatment assess treatment related adverse event . Subjects may undergo repeat bronchoscopy two week ( 14 day +/- 2 day ) follow initial SCT treatment clinically indicate routine practice treat physician . A SCT treatment NORMAL flow setting may perform 14 day bronchoscopy deem clinically indicate . If subject treat SCT 14-day treatment , contact Day 1 follow treatment assess treatment related adverse event . A follow-up bronchoscopy reassess luminal patency treatment site heal response perform 30 day ( +/- 5 day ) follow last SCT treatment . The last SCT treatment may initial treatment day 14-day treatment perform . , degree airway narrow estimate treat physician use graded scale digital endoscopic image obstruction take assessed neutral assessor blind treatment . The primary efficacy endpoint statistical analysis study power proportion subject exhibit adequate ( minimum 25 % ) improvement airway patency . Based prior clinical experience liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy ablation technique , response rate approximately 80 % anticipate . This study power detect 20 % low response rate ( i.e . 60 % low ) compare expect rate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects symptomatic , clinically significant central airway obstruction require treatment intervention candidate surgical resection . The central airway obstruction must consequence following : 1 . Benign airway strictures 2 . Primary secondary endobronchial tumor locate central airway 3 . Airway stent complicate significant granulation tissue 2 . Subjects ( designated proxy ) able provide write informed consent 3 . Subjects age 18 year great 4 . Subjects Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 3 less 5 . Subjects deem eligible candidate spray cryotherapy base medical history physical exam 1 . Subjects undergoing treatment investigational therapy within month precede cryotherapy plan within 1 month follow treatment . Subjects malignant stricture require chemotherapy/radiation therapy ( include investigational therapy ) within 30 day allow participation study . 2 . Subjects extraluminal cause airway obstruction bulky mediastinal adenopathy , central mediastinal tumor cause compression airway 3 . Subjects less 3 month expect survival 4 . Subjects anticipated require stent placement initial treatment 5 . Subjects pregnant nursing , per device instruction use 6 . Subjects ( designate proxy ) unwilling provide write informed consent 7 . Subjects ECOG performance status great 3 8 . Subjects likely difficulty comply study visit followup schedule 9 . Known history unresolved drug alcohol dependency would limit ability comprehend follow instruction relate informed consent , posttreatment instruction , followup 10 . Subjects uncontrolled coagulopathy bleeding disorder</criteria>
