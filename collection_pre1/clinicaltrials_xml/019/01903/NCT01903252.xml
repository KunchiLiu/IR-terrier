	<brief_title>TP05 Treatment Mild Moderate Active UC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , randomise , double-blind , active-controlled , multi-centre , non-inferiority trial evaluate safety efficacy 3.2 g TP05/day compare 3.2 g/day Asacol™ open label extension ass long-term safety tolerability TP05 administer 26 week period . A total 800 subject mildly moderately active UC evaluate . Eligible subject randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive 3.2 g/day TP05 ( administer daily ) 3.2 g/day Asacol™ . The primary efficacy outcome assess Week 8 . All subject respond TP05/Asacol™ ( response remission ) continue receive blind study treatment 12 week . After , subject enroll Open Label Extension ( OLE ) 26 week duration receive TP05 . Subjects fail respond study drug Week 8 visit enroll OLE week 8 receive 4.8 g/day TP05 .</detailed_description>
