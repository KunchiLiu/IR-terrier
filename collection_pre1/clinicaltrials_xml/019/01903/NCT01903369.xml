	<brief_summary>The investigator would like compare stiffness inside outside nerve use special type ultrasound image call shear wave elastography . Shear wave elastography special form ultrasound picture take colour . An ultrasound machine different way take picture inside body : one measure brightness different body part ( often refer B-Mode scan ) , picture take way may see unborn baby inside mum 's tummy ; another way measure stiffness different body structure shear wave elastography work . The investigator hope new technology help doctor see part body important .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Intraneural Extraneural Young 's Modulus Using Shear Wave Elastography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shear wave elastography quantitative ultrasound modality increasingly use differentiate `` hard '' breast cancer mass `` soft '' normal tissue . Unlike strain elastography , shear wave elastography applies non-compressive longitudinal acoustic radiation force underlie tissue , induce transverse shear wave . Studies Thiel embalm human cadaver show significant difference Young 's modulus intraneural extraneural tissue , ready colour differentiation tissue . The investigator pilot study show 3-fold great Young 's modulus within nerve Thiel embalm cadaver human volunteer . The investigator hypothesis shear wave elastography differentiate nerve adjacent tissue patient nerve block surgery . If , technology potential reduce incidence complication UGRA encourage parallel application cancer node biopsy .</detailed_description>
