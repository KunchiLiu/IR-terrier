	<brief_summary>In recent year , medium attention focus long-term sequela repeat concussive episode professional athlete . The grow understanding damage do consider `` ding '' game match , neurologic consequence `` play '' return play soon lead additional interest concern pediatric athlete ( 18 ) experience sports-related concussion game practice play . Because recent year full scope damage do repeat concussive episode come light , little research do treatment concussion either adults child . Brain injuries child especially problematic , brain may continue develop child reach age 24 old , concussion time development may particularly damage . Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) omega-3 fatty acid commonly find fish oil algae . DHA know improve development eye brain young child . It think effective anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant , since occur naturally cause harmful side effect , may useful compound treatment pediatric concussion . This feasibility trial DHA treatment sport concussion pediatric population . The investigator ' primary aim determine acceptability randomization compound well rate enrollment give clinical population . The investigator ' secondary aim examine preliminary outcome . The investigator hypothesize subject take 2 g DHA daily 3 month see short time full recovery return play short time resolve balance disturbance . These good , albeit unvalidated , clinical indicator concussive recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DHA For The Treatment Pediatric Concussion Related Sports Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled feasibility trial DHA treatment pediatric concussion relate sports-injury . The definition use concussion Consensus Statement Concussion Sport : 3rd International Conference Concussion Sport ( Br J Sports Med 2009 ; 43 : Suppl 1 i76-i84 doi:10.1136/bjsm.2009.058248 ) meet follow criterion : 1 . Direct blow head , face , neck blow elsewhere body `` impulsive '' force transmit head . 2 . Rapid onset short-lived impairment neurologic function one follow clinical domain resolve spontaneously : 1. symptom : somatic ( eg , headache ) , cognitive ( eg , feel like fog ) and/or emotional symptom ( eg , lability ) . 2. physical sign ( eg , loss consciousness , amnesia ) . 3. behavioural change ( eg , irritability ) . 4. cognitive impairment ( eg , slow reaction time ) . 5. sleep disturbance ( eg , drowsiness ) . 3 . No abnormality standard structural neuroimaging study , neuroimaging study complete clinically-indicated reason . Note : neuroimaging part study protocol . Study participant undergo neuroimaging part study . Subjects randomize 1:1 fashion . DHA omega-3 fatty acid occur naturally fish oil algae . There many dietary supplement contain DHA available marketplace . Martek Biosciences provide algae-based DHA compound minimize side effect `` fishiness '' flavor `` fish burp . '' The DHA produce Martek Biosciences also use many infant formula company US . DHA identical placebo provide Martek Biosciences . The DHASCO capsule supply 950 mg capsule effective dose 500 mg DHA per capsule . The placebo capsule supply 950 mg capsule consist 475 mg corn oil 475 mg soy oil . Both DHA placebo flavor sweet orange flavor mask agent . They supply seal white plastic bottle contain 100-200 capsule per bottle , depend dose . Each bottle lot number stamp . The capsule store dry , locked compartment room temperature ( 60 75 F ) . Martek 's Quality Assurance department complete regularly schedule chemical long-term stability analyse lot capsule . If shipment occur warm month , arrangement make capsule ship ice pack temporary refrigeration . Capsules dispense subject separate bottle quantity sufficient last next appointment . Any unused capsule return PI research staff send pharmacy destruction compliance Children 's regulation . Subjects randomize 2 g DHA match placebo 12 week . In order achieve dose DHA , subject receive 2 950 mg capsule twice day . Subjects tolerate divide dose 2000 mg per day discontinue study . Although much knowledge pathophysiology concussion come animal model , believe mechanical trauma brain cause sudden disruption ionic balance , lead increase calcium increase glucose metabolism cell try compensate potassium/calcium imbalance . This follow period decrease glucose metabolism may last 4 week human , result continue high level calcium interfere mitochondrial oxidative metabolism . This decrease mitochondrial oxidative metabolism appear biphasic , improvement see 2 , follow decrease bottom day 5 recovers around day 10 . Other important aspect concussive trauma include free radical production , initiation inflammatory response , alter neurotransmission . DHA several important function brain relatively side effect , make good option concussion treatment . DHA helpful modulate ion channel ; high level DHA associate high level sodium pump activity , possible provide DHA post-injury may help cell reduce calcium balance quickly efficiently . DHA also apparent anti-inflammatory action . DHA interfere inflammatory arachidonic acid cascade reduce affinity platelet TxA2/PGH2 receptor ligand . Additionally , high level DHA cerebral cortex cause significantly high level anti-oxidant enzyme catalase , glutathione glutathione peroxidase -- result decreased cerebral level lipid peroxide . DHA reduce formation peroxynitrite free radical reduces formation pro-inflammatory cytokine inhibit transcription factor NF−κB inducible nitric oxide synthetase . Finally , DHA highly concentrate synapsis , indicate role synaptic signal transduction . DHA appear address many different aspect believe concussive injury affect brain . The primary outcome feasibility trial determine willingness patient randomize , expect rate enrollment base clinic population , protocol adherence enrol study participant . We anticipate result study provide data inform large randomize trial DHA treatment pediatric sport concussion . Secondary outcome time clearance return play ( day ) improvement balance , assess Balance Error Scoring System ( BESS ) component Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 ( SCAT-3 ) . Time clearance return play choose clinically significant measurement medical professional sport medicine field . The investigator determine clearance return full competitive game play ( Stage 6 graduate return play protocol ) accord Consensus Statement guideline follow law Texas , House Bill 2038 . Criteria return play include complete clinical recovery concussion include return baseline symptom , exam neurocognitive function successful completion gradual return play progression . The BESS chosen relatively simple assessment note investigator good predictor neurological recovery . In addition time return play BESS , SCAT-3 Immediate Post Concussion Assessment Cognitive Testing ( ImPACT ) computerize neurocognitive testing program use evaluate recovery . The SCAT-3 standardized method evaluate injured athlete concussion use athlete age 10 year old . The ImPACT program computerize exam help quantify degree symptom , injury , dysfunction occurs sport related concussion . Although test utilize many professional , college , high school sport program throughout country , unclear use contributes safer expedited return activity . Finally , information side effect collect every visit order track rate severity side effect patient population . We plan enroll 40 subject study , consist 20 subject treat DHA 20 subject treat placebo . In order achieve enrollment 40 total subject , anticipate screen 80 subject order consent 40 . Because pilot study , information early withdrawal important u extra subject consent due . We anticipate take approximately 12 month complete enrollment , additional 3 month patient follow-up last patient enrol . We anticipate take approximately 6-9 month complete data clean-up , analysis , manuscript submission total study duration 2 year . Subjects non-compliant protocol either keep appointment take study pill direct may discontinue study . Subjects tolerate minimum dose 2000 mg DHA per day experience intolerable side effect discontinue . Subjects choose withdraw consent discontinue early .</detailed_description>
