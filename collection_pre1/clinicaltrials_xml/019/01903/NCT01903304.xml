	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize control nutrition intervention trial determine immunological impact high olive oil consumption elderly . Aging associate impaired immune response contribute high incidence infection elderly . Previously show type fatty acid diet influence immune response . In particular , reduce consumption fat high n-6 fatty acid show improve immune response age . Very study evaluate role olive oil , main oil consume part Mediterranean diet immune response elderly . We hypothesize high olive oil consumption improve immune function elderly . In addition , investigate effect high olive oil consumption gene expression relevant pathway circulate mononuclear cell , well cognitive function . Subject recruitment enrollment conduct USDA HNRCA . Following screening , 40 eligible overweight obese participant age 65 randomized one two nutrition intervention group period 12 week : [ 1 ] Control Typical American Diet A , ( N=20 ) [ 2 ] Experimental Diet B ( N=20 ) . Participants Control Diet A consume low-fiber , high-fat typical American Diet . Those Diet B consume similar diet typical American diet , ask replace oil intake extra virgin olive oil . Dietary counseling provide study dietitian Metabolic Research Kitchen Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center Aging ( HNRCA ) Tufts University study oil replace oil subject ' diet . Subjects follow regularly study dietitian throughout intervention period provide support ensure compliance study protocol . Data collection take place baseline , subject study diet period three month . Data collection study outcome measure interest comprise blood drawing , anthropometric measurement , cellular immune factor . Specifically , measure include : 1. vivo index T cell-mediated function [ delay type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) ] , 2. plasma inflammation marker ( IL-1b , IL-6 , TNF-a , CRP , MCP-1 , sICAM-1 , sVCAM-1 ) , 3. ability T cell subset ( CD4 CD8 , naïve memory ) proliferate , 4 . Ex vivo production cytokine PGE2 immune cell . 5 . Gene expression relevant pathways use transcriptomics analysis circulate mononuclear cell . 6 . The CANTAB ( Cambridge Cognition Ltd , Tunbridge Court , Tunbridge Lane , Bottisham , Cambridge , CB25 9TU , UK ) computerize cognitive assessment , 7 . Beck Depression Inventory . This study conduct Nutritional Immunology Lab , Dr. Simin Meydani PI Drs . Barnett ( Project director ) , Wu ( Lab Director ) , Dallal ( Biostatistician ) , Saltzman ( Study Physician ) , Sen , Scott , Ordovas Co-Investigators . Dr. Ascension Marcos Scientific National Research Council ( CSIC ) also Co-I study .</detailed_description>
