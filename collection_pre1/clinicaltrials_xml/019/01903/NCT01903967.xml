	<brief_summary>Recent study estimate prevalence pituitary adenoma approximately 1/1500 person . Pituitary tumour usually consider benign . However , local invasion report 35-40 % pituitary adenoma ; resistance medical treatment recurrence lead multimodal therapy report 15 % case . These tumour consider aggressive pituitary tumour present distinct biological clinical entity continue growth despite multimodal therapy , include surgery radiotherapy ( McCormack et al. , 2011 ) . Whilst tumours malignant potential , term pituitary carcinoma strictly reserve rare tumour ( 0.2 % ) demonstrate craniospinal systemic metastasis ( Heaney , 2011 ) . Pituitary aggressive malignant tumour difficult control ultimately prove lethal . It suggest early aggressive treatment ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy ) may control progression occurrence metastasis . However , therapeutic option associate important side effect limit use prediction pituitary tumor behaviour remain challenge . At diagnosis , clinical sign specific result concern proliferative factor ( Ki-67 P53 ) , putative oncogene ( PTTG ) conflict one series another . In case-control retrospective study cohort 410 patient ( HYPOPRONOS ) , validate prognostic pathological classification base histological radiological data ( J. Trouillas 2012 preparation ) . Tumours classify 3 grade : grade 1= non-invasive tumour , grade 2= invasive tumour grade 3 = aggressive-invasive tumor combination radiological sign invasion 2 3 sign increase proliferation ( Ki-67 index &gt; 3 % , number mitoses &gt; 2 per 10 field 400X , P53 nuclear detection ) . It widely accept cancer clonal disease , arise single normal cell progress thanks accumulation DNA alteration ( Sanson et al. , 2011 ) . To identify role DNA alteration , conduct array CGH analysis limit 13 prolactin pituitary tumour , frozen fragment , identify allelic loss chromosome 11 associated aggressiveness malignancy ( Wierinckx et al. , 2011 ) . To confirm encouraging result propose conduct study large series tumour , fix embed , correlate result clinical data .</brief_summary>
