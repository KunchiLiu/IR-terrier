	<brief_summary>Robotic surgery hold potential overcome many ergonomic challenge pose laparoscopic surgery . In study , propose quantify potential ergonomic benefit measure electromyography ( EMG ) instrument motion analysis subject perform surgical task use robotic assistance versus standard laparoscopic instrumentation . Hypothesis : We hypothesize surgeon experience significant , measurable ergonomic advantage perform task use robotic surgery compare conventional laparoscopic tool . Study design : Subjects study include three group vary degree train - ( 1 ) novice laparoscopists/novice roboticists , ( 2 ) expert laparoscopists/novice roboticists , ( 3 ) expert laparoscopsts/expert roboticists . Subjects perform follow task ( choose base reliability validity previous study ) . Each task perform standard laparoscopic instrumentation da Vinci Surgical System . - Inanimate ( dry lab ) : Fundamentals Laparoscopic ( FLS ) peg transfer , pattern cutting , intracorporeal suturing . - Animate ( porcine lab ) : laparoscopic bowel resection anastomosis , robotic bowel resection anastomosis . - Human ( clinical case ) : laparoscopic robotic procedure ( preferably laparoscopic bowel resection anastomosis , robotic bowel resection anastomosis ) . Outcome measure : - Time completion task - EMG : peak amplitude , % maximum voluntary contraction frequency analysis - NASA Task Load Index score - Subject-Reported Qualitative Data survey - Quality analysis task ( e.g. , pattern cut accuracy , % knot tie securely ) dry lab animate lab task ) - Instrument motion analysis task ( dry lab animate lab task )</brief_summary>

Those subject meet inclusion criterion yet disqualify exclusion criterion prospectively enrol informed consent process one three experimental group study , define subject 's degree expertise Minimally Invasive Surgery : Inclusion Criteria : 1. age &gt; 18 year 2. medical student , resident , fellow , attend Surgery , Urology , Obstetrics-Gynecology Washington University School Medicine 3 . Inclusion Novice Laparoscopist/Novice Roboticist Group : performance &lt; 100 laparoscopic case &lt; 50 robotic case primary surgeon first assistant surgeon one 's career 4 . Inclusion Expert Laparoscopist/Novice Roboticist Group : performance = &gt; 100 laparoscopic case &lt; 50 robotic case primary surgeon first assistant surgeon one 's career 5 . Inclusion Expert Laparoscopist/Expert Roboticist Group : performance = &gt; 100 laparoscopic case = &gt; 50 robotic case primary surgeon first assistant surgeon one 's career Exclusion Criteria : 1. age &lt; 18 year 2. know severe skin sensitivity allergies adhesive Screening , recruitment , inform consent process may conduct Principal Investigator approve study member list IRB protocol . To eliminate potential conflict interest , recruitment consent medical student resident study perform study investigator supervisory role medical student resident , Principal Investigator . To ensure subject adequately inform study , informed consent process include limited discussion research procedure ; anticipate frequency type participant interaction ; length study period ; potential risk benefit participant ; practice protect privacy confidentiality participant ; alternative participate clinical study ; mean ask question , report concern , withdraw study time . Each subject inform decision participate participate study way impact health care decision health care provider , clinical academic performance evaluation evaluator . This information also include `` Informed Consent Document '' `` Notice Privacy Practices '' , content document review subject time informed consent discussion . Each subject opportunity review document leisure decision participate study , subject receive time inform consent discussion sign copy `` Informed Consent Document '' `` Notice Privacy Practices '' keep personal record . Each subject enrol informed consent discussion private environment facilitate subject comfort discuss detail study ask question . During subject enrollment attempt , opportunity provide subject meet individually approve study member list IRB protocol address private question concern . Private environment may include private office , private conference room , private laboratory room . The subject able discus study family , friend , and/or others decide participation . The subject end study enrollment period consider study participation . Each subject respond invitation participate study time inform consent discussion receive copy `` Informed Consent Document '' `` Notice Privacy Practices '' sign approve study member list IRB protocol inform consent discuss , stamp envelope address Principal Investigator event subject wish consent study later time within enrollment period . There follow-up contact regard study subject wish respond invitation participate study . Capacity consent subject enrol study determine approve study member list IRB protocol conduct informed consent . Capacity consent assess variety way explain study subject ask answer basic question study procedure , risk benefit , option skip question , withdraw study . The document entitle `` Evaluation Sign Informed Consent '' provide IRB may resource use assist assessment . If time approve study member list IRB protocol reason believe subject incompetent incapacitate make decision , consent process abort , subject enrol study .</detailed_description>
