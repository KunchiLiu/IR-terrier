	<brief_summary>This study look method hormonal birth control , call NuvaRing , specific anti-HIV medication , call antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) . Some study woman use hormonal birth control method ( specifically oral pill , patch , injection ) take ARVs show ARVs interact hormone release birth control medication . These interaction may cause birth control less effective preventing pregnancy . There also concern hormonal birth control increase HIV spread others , study need determine true . The investigator know whether NuvaRing ARVs interact use together , study look see certain ARVs ( efavirenz atazanavir/ritonavir ) interact two hormone release NuvaRing . This help u determine NuvaRing safe effective woman HIV infection take ARVs . The study also include HIV-infected woman ARVs use NuvaRing show u hormone level like similar group woman ARVs . Vaginal ring also currently study deliver anti-HIV medication may prevent HIV acquisition , provide birth control long period time ( 1 month ) . Since vaginal ring become commonly used administer medication , investigator want good understand potential drug interaction drug give vaginally . This study also help u understand potential drug interaction ARVs give orally , drug give vaginal ring , like NuvaRing . Additionally , study help u understand hormone release vaginal ring affect amount HIV virus genital tract , bacterial make-up ( microbiome ) female genital track , immune system within genital tract , may affect chance spread HIV .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Documented HIV1 infection . Participants must receive either 1 ) EFV 600 mg daily 2 NRTIs , 2 ) ATV/r 300 mg/ 100 mg daily TDF 300 mg 1 additional NRTIs , 3 ) ART . ART regimens stable 30 day prior study entry plan change therapy first 28 day study . Participants receive ART plan initiate ART first 28 day study . NOTE : Participants must access ART regimens primary care provider . ART medication supply study . For participant ART , documentation plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; /= 400 copies/mL obtain within 60 day prior study entry . For participant ART , CD4+ cell count must ≥350 cells/mm3 , obtain within 60 day prior study entry . Laboratory value within 60 day prior study entry : Platelet count ≥50,000 platelets/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL Aspartate transaminase ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( SGPT ) &lt; 5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤2.0 x ULN Last menstrual period &lt; /=6 month prior study entry . If last menstrual period &gt; 6 month prior study entry without another cause amenorrhea , recent pregnancy , serum folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) must check &lt; /= 40 mIU/mL eligible enrollment . Premenopausal females least one function ovary . Documentation Pap smear within 1 year prior study entry . Negative serum urineHCG pregnancy test sensitivity ≤25 mIU/mL within 60 day prior study entry within 24 hour prior study entry All participant must agree participate conception process ( eg , active attempt become pregnant vitro fertilization ) duration study . Because unknown ARVs adversely affect efficacy NuvaRing contraceptive method , participant reproductive potential , participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , must agree use additional reliable form contraception study . Acceptable additional method contraception include : Condoms ( male female ) without spermicidal agent Nonhormonal intrauterine device ( IUD ) Other hormonal form contraception allow study period . Condoms use prevent transmission HIV sexually transmit disease sexual partner . NOTE : Participants bilateral tubal ligation nonhormonal IUD may enrol . Received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate ( DMPA ) within 4 month prior study entry . Received hormonal therapy ( eg , oral contraceptive agent , hormone contain vaginal ring , contraceptive patch , hormone replacement therapy , anabolic therapy , include nandrolone decanoate megestrol acetate ) within 30 day prior study entry . Breastfeeding . Less 6 week postpartum study entry . Use prohibit medication within 30 day prior study entry .
