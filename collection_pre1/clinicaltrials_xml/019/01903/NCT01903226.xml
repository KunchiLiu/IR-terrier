	<brief_title>Intervention Study Assess Effects Moderate High Intensity Aerobic Training Physical Capacity Activity Level Persons With Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Randomized controlled trial . Participants : 45 subject , 18 65 year age , recruit follow inclusion criterion : Traumatic spinal cord injury , incomplete lesion ( classified ASIA D ) , admit Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital primary rehabilitation , able walk 5 minute treadmill ( without assistive aid ) 4 km/hour . Subjects cardiovascular disease , progressive disease severe psychiatric condition exclude . Procedures : The participant include medical approval ( specialist physical medicine rehabilitation ) discharge primary rehabilitation . During last week hospital , usually 3 6 month post injury , pre-test examine physical capacity perform ; maximal exercise test treadmill six-minute walk test ( Fig . 1 ) . After pre-test participant randomize one three group ; Intervention Group I ( high intensity training ) , Intervention Group II ( medium intensity training ) , Control Group ( treatment usual , additional training ) . To achieve balance randomization ( compare group size ) , use block randomization . A computer random number generator use , block size 15 allocation ratio 1:1 . The subject train group practical train hospital perform moderate high intensity training . They teach apply heart rate monitor use training session . At discharge primary rehabilitation , start-up 12 week training program , physical activity level ( energy expenditure ; kilo joule ( kJ ) · min -1 ) monitor wear SWA seven day home situation . After completed training program , participant ( include control group ) wear SWA 7 day return Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital repeat physical capacity test ( post-test ) . This procedure also repeat follow-up one year discharge primary rehabilitation ( 12-months follow-up ) . All test perform supervision physiotherapist , several year experience exercise test . This physiotherapist unaware three group patient patient recruit ( blind control trail ) . Interventions : Subjects two intervention group perform 12 week individual training program , 15 subject perform high intensity train 15 subject perform train program moderate intensity training . Since literature indicate SCI patient , group level , improve physical capacity discharge , subject perform train program home situation . To verify intensity level training session , participant wear heart rate monitor . The heart rate store later analysis . Subjects train group contact , telephone , first sixth week training program , evaluate training . A training log fill subject ( include control group ) week 2-13 . When compare two training program , one must sure total amount energy expend ( total oxygen uptake ) equal . The calculation total oxygen uptake different training program base relationship % HRmax % VO2max , establish American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) . Intervention group I - High intensity train The training program high intensity consist two high intensity training session per week , use treadmill outdoor walking/running . During session subject walk/run 4 time 4 minute intensity 85-95 % HRmax ( interval training ) . Between interval , subject active resting period ( 3 minute ) , walk intensity 70 % HRmax . The subject free choose day week conduct training session , however , must least one ( rest ) day . Intervention group II - Moderate intensity train The training program moderate intensity consist three moderate intensity training session per week , use treadmill walk outdoor . During session subject walk 45 minute 70 % HRmax . The subject free choose day week conduct training session Control group The subject control group ( n=15 ) additional training program , leave treatment usual . They , however , offer individual training program one year follow-up test . Outcome measure Primary outcome measure : - Difference VO2peak ( change pre-test post-test 1 ) intervention group control group . Healthy , untrained subject show 0.5 % increase VO2peak every ( high intensity ) training session . Assuming person incomplete SCI show increase , need 15 subject detect mean difference 12 % VO2peak . Sample size calculation base standard deviation 10 % significance level 0.05 power output 80 % . Secondary outcome measure : - Difference VO2peak intervention group 1 ( high intensity ) 2 ( moderate intensity ) , complete training program ( post-test 1 ) - Changes VO2peak ( change pre-test , post-test 1 post-test 2 ) intervention group control group . - Difference VO2peak intervention group I ( high intensity ) II ( moderate intensity ) , one year discharge ( post-test 2 ) . - Difference daily energy expenditure ( kilo joule ( kJ ) · min -1 ) pre-test , posttest 1 post-test 2 - Difference daily energy expenditure ( kilo joule ( kJ ) · min -1 ) intervention group I ( high intensity ) II ( moderate intensity ) , one year discharge ( post-test 2 ) . Data analyse statistic : Oxygen uptake last 30 second maximal exercise test use estimate peak oxygen uptake ( VO2peak ) . VO2peak pre- post test ( 1 , 2 3 ) compare evaluate possible training effect . From SWA data , daily energy expenditure ( energy expend one week divide 7 day ) train program , train program one year discharge , compare evaluate possible effect training program subject ' physical activity level .</detailed_description>
