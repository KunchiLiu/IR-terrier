	<brief_summary>There 3 specific study purpose . First , examine treatment effect RT combine dCIT ( RT + dCIT ) compare RT , dCIT , dose-matched control therapy ( DMCT ) stroke patient . Outcome domains include motor , sensory , muscle function , amount arm activity real-life situation , patient-reported outcome daily performance quality life , kinematic performance . Additionally , potential adverse effect include fatigue , pain , biomarker oxidative stress examine . Second , investigate demographical clinical characteristic stroke patient may predict probability achieve clinically important change treatment outcomes . Thirdly , study examine whether improvement treatment reach clinically important ass clinimetric property outcome measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research project investigate efficacy RT sequential combination dCIT relative therapy give alone study factor relevant outcome prediction inform clinical practice . There 3 primary purpose comprehensive research : Ⅰ . We examine effect RT combine dCIT ( RT + dCIT ) compare RT , dCIT , dose-matched control therapy ( DMCT ) stroke patient . Outcome domains include motor , sensory , muscle function , amount arm activity real-life situation , patient-reported outcome daily performance quality life , kinematic performance treatment , midterm assessment , treatment . In addition , potential adverse effect include post-exertional fatigue , post-exertional pain , biomarker oxidative stress examine . We hypothesize therapeutic regimen combine RT dCIT contribute significantly reduction impairment disability stroke patient intervention group . Ⅱ . We investigate demographical clinical characteristic stroke patient may significantly predict probability achieve clinically significant change treatment outcomes . The proposed candidate predictor chronicity , side lesion , muscle tone , finger extension , motor function distal upper limb ( UL ) , amount real-life arm activity . Ⅲ . We examine whether improvement treatment clinically important ass clinimetric property outcome measure establish clinical significance relevant individualize stroke rehabilitation . We also assess compare clinimetric property ( e.g. , validity , responsiveness , minimal detectable change , minimal clinically important difference ) rehabilitation outcome inform selection instrument .</detailed_description>
