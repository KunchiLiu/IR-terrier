	<brief_summary>To examine whether breathe test ( methacholine challenge use impulse oscillometry ) use tell difference two different dos inhale drug , salmeterol , deliver Advair child asthma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Response Salmeterol Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During study subject attend 4 study visit : 2 screen visit 2 treatment visit . Before study visit , subject stop use certain asthma medication . At Screening Visit 1a , parent/guardian read sign inform consent form allow subject take part study . The subject , appropriate , ask sign last page indicate his/her assent study . The study coordinator conduct interview find subject 's medical history , diseases asthma , previous medication medication subject take his/her participation study . Vital sign , i.e . blood pressure , heart rate , respiration , height weight measure , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) test measure electrical activity subject 's heart , perform . The subject examine Pediatric Pulmonary physician teach proper way use Diskus® inhaler . The subject able show he/she correctly . At Screening Visit 1b , test appropriate range subject take 2 puff Flovent Diskus® . One hour later , subject perform breathe test call impulse oscillometry . Essentially , sound send lung computer convert return sound number . Then subject begin breathe test methacholine , drug make airways small . He/she begin inhale low dose nebulizer perform oscillometry . After 5 minute interval he/she breathe increase dos , 6 time his/her breathe test increase 40 % . Albuterol administer immediately end challenge subject monitor his/her breathing return within 20 % challenge . If methacholine test result within appropriate range subject eligible treatment phase schedule Visit No . 2 . At treatment visit , subject take 2 puff study drug two Diskus® inhaler , either 1 puff Flovent 1 puff Advair , 1 puff Advair two different inhaler . This do blind manner study coordinator know treatment use time . There 1 hour wait time medication administer methacholine challenge start . Albuterol administer immediately end challenge subject monitor his/her breathing return within 20 % challenge .</detailed_description>
