	<brief_title>The Role Spreader Flaps Preventing Nasal Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhinoplasty common facial plastic surgery procedure , one complication nasal vault narrow consequent nasal obstruction . Recently , researcher pay much attention nasal valve area especially role upper lateral cartilage ( ULC ) preserve nasal patency , since possible consequence destructive technique permanent functional problem patient . In addition functional problem , cause aesthetic problem inverted-V deformity . Accordingly , reconstruction midvault dorsal reduction advocate widely adopt . The gold standard midvault reconstruction dorsal reduction spreader graft , first advocate Sheen . Subsequently , usage widen include repair valve unoperated nose , efficacy well-documented . However , time-consuming procedure require harvest septal cartilage . Therefore , author propose spreader flap alternative technique . While result mention article propose efficacy spreader flap , none randomize trial subjective method use measurement nasal breathe rhinoplasty . Nasal obstruction evaluate different method , quantitative subjective , validity debate . For example , numeric form Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) commonly use , ultimately related patient ' subjective perception . Alternatively , objective evaluation nasal patency also common interest many researcher , various method objective measurement exist . Among different method , acoustic rhinomanometry effective tool . However , researcher debate reliability result . Herein examine efficacy spreader flap prevent nasal obstruction dorsal reduction use randomize trial objective subjective measure .</detailed_description>
