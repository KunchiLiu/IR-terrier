Behavioral extinction train form learning may modulate NMDA receptor mediate glutamate transmission . The study 's main hypothesis partial NMDA receptor agonist D-cycloserine ( DCS ) facilitate cue exposure training may prevent relapse smoking . The aim propose study ass whether DCS-facilitation cue-exposure therapy improve abstinence among smoker nicotine patch seek treatment .
