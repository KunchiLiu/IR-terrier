	<brief_title>The Role Rapid Diagnostic Tests Malaria Targeting ACTs Community Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many setting majority people malaria particularly poor access formal care access anti-malarials informal community level . ACTs previously unaffordable group change introduction AMFm . To avoid miss alternative cause illness , reduce cost delay spread resistance ACTs , need target really need . Studies formal healthcare setting Ghana show microscopy available , impact Rapid Diagnostic Tests ( RDTs ) substantial . RDTs relatively simple use , require fairly minimal training master mechanic test preparation interpretation Whether deploy RDTs part AMFm unclear time.Even absence AMFm question best target antimalarial community important one , get malaria incidence many country decrease , make presumptive treatment febrile illness malaria increasingly ineffective . Locally chemical seller closest equivalent provide majority treatment , especially poor . It difficult predict whether RDTs would make chemical seller commonly access ( patient prefer diagnosis ) , less accessed ( patient like choice restricted/do want blood test etc ) . Studies settings suggest intervention improve diagnosis shop-keepers effective cost-effective .</detailed_description>
