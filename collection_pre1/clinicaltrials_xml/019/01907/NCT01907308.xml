	<criteria>1 . Subjects must histologically confirm urothelial carcinoma . At least 50 % tumor must demonstrate transitional cell histology . 2 . Measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion 3 . CT MRI chest , abdomen , pelvis , without contrast , within 28 day registration . A whole body bone scan may perform discretion treat physician . 4 . Only clinically indicate , CT MRI ( MRI prefer ) scan brain within 28 day registration . 5 . Progressive disease platinumcontaining regimen ( cisplatin carboplatin ) intolerance platinumbased therapy urothelial carcinoma . Subjects receive adjuvant cisplatin carboplatinbased chemotherapy urothelial carcinoma currently recurrent progressive disease eligible . 6 . Men woman &gt; 18 year old 7 . Generally wellcontrolled blood pressure systolic blood pressure ≤ 140 mmHg AND diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg prior enrolment randomization . The use antihypertensive medication control hypertension permit 8 . Adequate organ hematological function evidence follow laboratory study : a. Hematological function , follow : . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ii . Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L iii . Hemoglobin ≥= 9 g/dL b. Hepatic function , follow : i. Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , ii . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN iii . Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.0 x ULN iv . Total bilirubin within normal limit ( WNL ) c. Hemostatic function , follow : . International normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 ii . Activated Partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN d. Renal function , follow : . Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40 cc/min accord CockcroftGault formula : Creatinine Clearance calculator ( CrCl ) ( mL/min ) = ( 140age ) x actual body weight ( kg ) ( x 0.85 female ) 72 x serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) ii . Urinary protein quantitative value ≤ 30 mg urinalysis ≤ 1+ dipstick , unless quantitative protein ≤ 1000 mg 24 hour urine sample e. Cardiac function , follow ( known history cardiac dysfunction symptom indicative cardiac dysfunction ) : . Normal sinus rhythm clinically stable arrhythmia well controlled outpatient medication . ii . Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ low limit normal ( LLN ) per institutional laboratory range , determine echocardiogram multi gate acquisition scan ( MUGA ) scan within 28 day prior enrollment . If clear institutional standard , ejection fraction must ≥ 50 % . 9 . All baseline laboratory result must within 14 day registration 10 . Competent comprehend , sign , date institutional review board ( IRB ) approve informed consent form 11 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 . 12 . Subject plan begin protocoldirected therapy within 7 day registration 13 . All patient offer enrollment correlative biomarkers study 1 . Three previous systemic therapy combination regimens urothelial carcinoma ( e.g . cisplatin give gemcitabine consider one regimen ) recurrent metastatic setting . 2 . Grade 2 great neuropathy 3 .
