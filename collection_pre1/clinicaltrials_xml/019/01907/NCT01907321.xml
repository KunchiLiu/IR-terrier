	<brief_summary>Stroke lead case neurologic swallow dysfunction , dysphagia . Post stroke dysphagia associate approximately 50 % increase rate pneumonia diagnose ; aspiration pneumonia common respiratory complication stroke death , account three-fold increase 30-day post stroke death rate . The long-term goal systematic line research decrease morbidity , mortality , health care cost associate disordered airway protection follow stroke . The overall hypothesis central proposal ability protect airway dependent upon continuum multiple behavior , include swallow cough . Safe , efficient swallow prevents material enter larynx low airway , effective cough ejects aspirate mucus material . Currently , one end continuum , swallow , rigorously assessed stroke patient . However , ineffective disorder cough indicative inability eject aspirate material clear mucus secretion low airway . Ineffective clearance subsequent accumulation material lower airway increase risk chest infection . Hence , patient great risk chest infection would disorder swallowing ( dysphagia ) also disorder cough ( dystussia ) , mean likely aspirate material effectively eject aspirate airway . There high likelihood swallow cough simultaneously disorder follow stroke . To date , treatment target swallow cough function stroke patient . Expiratory muscle strength training ( EMST ) increase expiratory muscle strength ( Baker et al. , 2005 ) evidence support use improve swallow cough function patient Parkinson 's disease ( Troche et al. , press ) . This cross-system , device-driven approach rehabilitate multiple contributor airway protection deficit highly desirable stroke population due likelihood co-occurrence swallow cough disorder . To date , EMST test stroke patient . We propose include cough screening , evaluation treatment process disorder airway protection , able good identify treat patient risk airway compromise associate sequela .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods This pilot study include twenty acute ( 1-14 day post-ictus ) subacute ( 14 day - 6 month post-ictus ) ischemic stroke patient age 50 80 participant . Once enrol , participant complete battery pre-training baseline measure ( 'measures ' subheading ) randomize one two group : experimental EMST group , control group . The training ( EMST group ) control period last 5 week , post-training assessment consist measure take initial baseline visit . Once informed consent obtain , medical record review confirmation patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Cognitive status : Cognitive status stroke brain injured patient know impact recovery relate dysphagia , risk aspiration , cough . We use National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) ass stroke severity ( Appendix 1 ) . The NIHSS treat independent predictor cough and/or swallow dysfunction . Measures Maximum Expiratory Pressure : Maximum expiratory ( MEP ) pressure indirect measure expiratory muscle strength . The measurement apparatus consist mouthpiece connected pressure manometer 50 cm 2 mm i.d . tube 14-gauge-needle air-leak . In order measure MEP , participant seat nose occlude nose clip . After inhale total lung capacity , participant place lip around mouthpiece blow forcefully possible . Repeated measure take one two minute rest trial , three measurement obtain within 5 % . The average three value record . Lung function test : Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) Force Expiratory Volume one second ( FEV1 ) : The participant ask breathe total lung capacity . The participant ask blow forcefully possible computerized spirometer . FEV1 measure expiratory volume first second expiration force vital capacity maneuver . Alternatively , subject unable perform cognitive voluntary spirometric task , upper airway respiratory resistance ( R5 ) measure impulse oscillometry ( IOS , Jaeger Instruments ) . Impulse oscillometry require participant breath mouthpiece connect computer . The mouthpiece apparatus delivers small puff air whose reverberation provide measure upper low airway resistance . This take approximately 5-10 minute complete . Cough : Participants instrument measurement respiratory airflow pattern spontaneous breathing , voluntary cough capsaicin induce reflex cough . A facemask connect pneumotachograph use record airflow expiratory muscle activity measure surface electromyography ( sEMG ) , electrodes place rectus abdominous muscle , 8th intercostal space . The mouth airflow signal sEMG signal digitize record desktop computer ( Chart , ADInstruments , Inc ) . The computer signal analyze determine timing duration inspiratory , expiratory compression phase , well peak mean expiratory airflow cough ( Figure 4 ) , associate sEMG amplitude measure . Because recently report acute stroke relate brain injury differentially affect motor pattern voluntary reflex elicit cough ( Ward et al. , 2010 ) , hence essential elicit cough peripheral afferent stimulation ( capsaicin ; 'reflexive ' cough ) voluntary induce cough . Voluntary cough : Participants seat facemask connect pneumotachograph . They instruct produce strong cough three time facemask . They rest one minute trial . This take 5 - 10 minute complete . Reflexive cough / capsaicin administration : After participant instrument facemask , he/she seat comfortably chair front airflow fume hood . The airflow fume hood prevents exposure participant experimenter nebulized solution except participant inhales capsaicin challenge . Participants inspire deeply nebulizer ( contain capsaicin vehicle solution ) couple facemask pneumotachograph . The outflow nebulizer gas pass isopropyl alcohol solution remove capsaicin air vent fume hood . Dr. Davenport hold FDA IND # 76866 use capsaicin study cough motor pattern . This take 10 minute complete . Swallowing Evaluation : Videofluoroscopic measure : Swallowing assess use high resolution , dual modality videofluoroscopic ( VFS ) record device signal acquisition ( digitize 250 Hz ) digital storage retrieval respiratory swallow data ( Digital Swallowing Workstation , model 7100 , Lincoln Park , NJ : Kay Elemetrics ) . The clinical swallow examination comprises : brief swallow history , oral motor examination , 3 oz swallow test , Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Examination ( VFSE ) . The oral motor examination assess strength , time tone jaw , lip , face , larynx velopharynx structure contribute safe , adequate swallowing . Their impairment predictive swallowing abnormality . The 3 oz swallow test , require person swallow three ounce water . It also strongly associate aspiration instrumental testing . The VFSE include videotape participant radiologic suite ( Shands radiology department ) use standard fluoroscopic system remote monitor standard lateral view oropharynx . This lateral view allow visualization critical oral pharyngeal structure , include jaw , lip , tongue , soft palate , larynx pharynx . A video counter imprint time code examination aid subsequent analysis . Each examination consist 6 , 5-ml 10-ml thin liquid swallow , 3 , 15-ml thin liquid swallow , 6 , 5-ml 10-ml swallow barium pudding , one , 3oz thin liquid . Standardized `` bail-out '' criterion use eliminate serious aspiration . The Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile ( MBSImpâ„¢ ) use analyze VFS recording determine presence oral and/or pharyngeal swallow impairment . The MBSImp validate tool ( B. Martin-Harris et al. , 2008 ) assess swallow impairment . Six objective component oral pharyngeal impairment include score form , thus give overall impression swallow performance . The penetration-aspiration scale ( PAS ) ( Rosenbek , Robbins , Roecker , Coyle , &amp; Wood , 1996 ) use assess penetration aspiration ; PAS 8-point scale range 1 ( penetration/aspiration ) 8 ( aspiration cough response ) . EMST training procedure As indicated Informed Consent Form , completion baseline testing , participant randomize either experimental EMST group , control group . Participants group follow compensatory strategy , include diet modification and/or postural adjustment recommend safe swallowing base initial swallow examination . In addition , EMST group receive 5 week EMST . 1 . The EMST group give expiratory pressure threshold trainer , consist plexiglas tube variable tension spring control `` pop-off '' valve . The threshold training device use study modification commercially available device manufacture HealthScan , Inc . The modification device allow pressure threshold set 160 cmH20 . The current device allow pressure threshold setting 20 cmH20 . The high pressure-threshold setting necessary allow threshold set 75 % participant 's MEP . 2 . The training protocol consist five set five breath , five day per week 5 week pressure threshold set 75 % participant 's recently acquire MEP . The EMST participant provide write ( Appendix 2 ) verbal instruction completion training protocol . Participants mark completion train set log sheet ( Appendix 3 ) week . 3 . Each EMST participant visit home train therapist week week 5 week training period . The participant 's MEP measure time . Three trial complete . The maximum value use dataset . Any participant concern regard train program address time . 4 . Following training period , baseline measure describe breathing , cough , swallow re-evaluated . This constitute post-training baseline measure occur within one follow 5-week intervention Control group procedure : As indicate Informed Consent Form , completion baseline testing , participant randomize either experimental EMST group , control group . Participants randomize control group involve EMST treatment paradigm exercise treatment paradigm , EMST group , participant may use compensatory strategy per standard care . This ensure able safely maintain adequate nutritional status . Participants group assess pre-training post-training visit use identical protocol EMST group . They receive weekly home visit .</detailed_description>
