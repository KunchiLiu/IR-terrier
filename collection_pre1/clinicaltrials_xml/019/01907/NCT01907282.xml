	<detailed_description>The goal research conduct multisite randomize trial determine efficacy 6-month Family-Focused Treatment ( FFT ) comparison Enhanced Care ( EC ) , treatment-as-usual intervention , reduce symptom , enhance functional outcome , prevent delay onset full psychosis youth age 12-35 year meet criterion prodromal risk syndrome accord Structured Interview Prodromal Syndromes ( SIPS ) . Our primary , secondary , tertiary hypothesis , respectively , at-risk probands respond good FFT EC 6- 12-month follow-up , term symptom trajectory ( SIPS score ) , social/family function , first onset full psychosis . Subjects drawn participant prospective , longitudinal study elucidate predictor mechanisms conversion psychosis ( North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study , NAPLS ) , sit collaborate . Subjects interview every 6 month 1 year assess positive negative symptom , academic social functioning , family functioning , conversion psychosis . Recent progress risk ascertainment methodology enable reliable identification person prodromal `` clinical high-risk '' syndrome , 35 % develop psychosis within 2 Â½ year . This paradigm provide opportunity develop test intervention prodromal phase , onset full psychosis accumulation substantial functional disability . Psychosocial intervention appear well suited address issue motivational deficit functional disability psychosis prodrome . Given present state knowledge regard mechanism psychosis onset , give initial study antipsychotic drug prodromal patient produce discourage result term prevention , short term reduction symptom severity functional disability may represent achievable target reduction psychosis incidence . We develop pilot version FFT clinical high risk youth ( FFT-CHR ) consist psychoeducation , communication training , problem-solving skill train . In randomized trial , adult adolescent bipolar disorder child at-risk bipolar disorder undergo FFT improve symptomatically functionally compare patient brief psychoeducational control condition . Further , open trial family psychoeducation youth risk psychosis demonstrate symptomatic functional improvement relative baseline score . However , randomize control study examine efficacy FFT reduce symptom functional disability youth risk psychosis . In view improvement quality life reduction cost care occur preventive approach cardiovascular disease , diabetes , certain form cancer , field psychiatry need major commitment early detection/prevention framework debilitate syndrome - psychotic disorder . The prodromal risk syndrome criterion result clinical algorithm highly effective predicting onset full psychosis . However , knowledge limited utility lack mean intervene pre-onset phase way either reduces likelihood progression full psychosis , accumulation functional disability , . There currently cost-effective , evidence-based psychosocial approach psychosis prevention . Preventing neurotoxic effect early episode , illnesses become chronic , minimize psychosocial sequela early episode , may much prevent long-term disability cause psychosis thereby major impact public health . Our study take critical next step perform initial efficacy test highly promise family-focused intervention design stabilize symptom improve social role function risk youth .</detailed_description>
