	<detailed_description>This trial pilot study determine feasibility randomize clinical trial compare treatment algorithm consist limited number clinical parameter , rapid molecular viral diagnostics , serum procalcitonin test standard care direct antibiotic use patient non-pneumonic low respiratory tract infection . The reduction antibiotic use subject randomize treatment algorithm compare randomized standard care determine . In addition , add benefit viral diagnosis serum procalcitonin alone reduce antibiotic determine . Lastly , antibiotic related complication clinical outcome determine safety approach 30 day 3 month standard care intervention group evaluate . Analysis composite adverse event outcome ( death , intensive care unit transfer , disease specific complication recurrent respiratory tract infection require hospitalization ) serve principle safety analysis study . In addition , adverse outcome examine individually well less adverse outcome include antibiotic prescription , time return baseline health , patient report outcome functional status 30 day 3 month . Physicians queried determine factor drive antibiotic prescription potential barrier implement antibiotic reduction algorithm . These data use design phase III clinical trial intent demonstrate physician US respond appropriately information antibiotic use significantly safely curtail .</detailed_description>
