	<brief_summary>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , high blood pressure lung , rare condition shorten life . Although cause disease usually unknown , 70 % heritable 15-20 % idiopathic case change gene ( mutation ) control blood vessel grow function . The gene call bone morphogenetic protein type receptor 2 ( BMPR2 ) . Although mutation BMPR2 risk factor PAH , everyone mutation get disease . Additional genetic environmental factor likely contribute . The investigator suspect mutation gene responsible case PAH . In study investigator aim recruit patient PAH relatives follow several year . The investigator hope discover new mutation disease determine factor lead poor outcome , understand trigger disease patient mutation . Who participate ? Adults PAH , relatives control ( one blood sample )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>National Cohort Study Idiopathic Heritable Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>What study involve ? PAH patient see local centre service team additional blood urine sample take . Relatives PAH patient see every 6 month nearest PAH centre . Tests include : - Epidemiology Questionnaire ass factor affect health - An echocardiogram ( ECHO ) ass size , shape , pump action extent damage heart . - Lung function test include blow measurement ass gas volume within lung well assessment lung exchange gas . - Optional right heart catheterisation ( RHC ) determine much blood heart pump rest exercise . Optional Cardiac Magnetic Resonance test . To measure heart function . ( do ) - 6 minute walk test . To measure exercise capacity - Cardiopulmonary exercise test . A bicycle exercise test , indicate much blood heart pump rest different level exercise . - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , test measure electrical activity heart - Blood test - Urine Controls : Blood sample medical data collect</detailed_description>
