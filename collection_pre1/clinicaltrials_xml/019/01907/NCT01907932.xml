	<brief_summary>In internal medicine , assessment spleen size physical examination extremely important part overall evaluation patient many illness . Examination spleen also one core competency investigator expect student resident learn part training . Unfortunately , sensitivity specificity examination spleen bedside good . The investigator wish determine medical resident teach use hand carry ultrasound accurately assess spleen size . Doing would make physical examination spleen obsolete transform training objective medical trainee .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Estimation Spleen Residents With VScan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis splenomegaly extremely important manage patient blood disorder medical condition , cirrhosis . The ability recognize enlarged spleen timely manner impact patient outcomes . Although physical exam confidently use diagnosis massive enlargement spleen , evaluate less degree splenomegaly bedside prof difficult . In current practice , gold standard diagnosis splenomegaly conventional abdominal ultrasound . The prevalence splenomegaly patient blood condition medical disorder relatively high . Therefore , demand abdominal ultrasound grow similarly cost caring patient condition . In addition , examination spleen one core competency investigator expect student resident learn part training . This physical diagnosis maneuver frequently use examine resident Royal College level determine fitness practice . Unfortunately , sensitivity specificity examination spleen bedside good . With introduction hand carry ultrasound ( HCU ) device , rapid bedside assessment patient possible . The Visual scan ( VScan ) ( GE Healthcare , USA ) allow 2D image 3.5 inch display show comparable image quality standard ultrasound application . The VScan HCU use point care evaluate number condition greatly impact treatment decision medical patient bedside . The ability recognize splenomegaly timely manner impact patient outcome . In addition , use technology could significantly impact training standard student resident . It remain unclear whether bedside evaluation VScan able accurately measure spleen size . The investigator conduct extensive literature review investigator unable find study attempt accurately assess spleen size HCU . The investigator recently demonstrate trained ultrasonographers reliably assess spleen size bedside use VScan . The current study aim determine diagnostic accuracy VScan use medical resident train use , patient vary degree splenomegaly , include normal spleen size . If investigator show medical resident accurately characterize spleen size bedside hand carry device , next stage study determine investigator integrate HCU physical examination bedside ass spleen size . Design , Specification Endpoints , Procedures : The investigator propose validation study 50 patient medical condition may result vary degree splenomegaly ( include normal spleen size ) look hematology clinic Vancouver General Hospital ( VGH ) . Patients recruit base information provide chart private office hematologists VGH . The investigator also enroll 20 first year medical resident . First year resident send letter email describing study . Each medical resident undergo one hour training session ultrasonographer regard use HCU ass spleen size . At end session , evaluate sonographer make sure know use HCU acquire image spleen . If proficient undergo subsequent one hour training session . On separate day , train ultrasonographer perform conventional ultrasound patient accurately measure spleen size . This information provide patient hematologist . Subsequently resident attempt measure size patient 's spleen use VScan . Each patient scan 5 time 5 different resident . Each resident blind patient 's underlying medical condition result previous scan . Variables interest include : adequacy study , finding 2D imaging , overall diagnosis presence splenomegaly , confidence level diagnosis time complete test . The goal determine medical resident use hand carry ultrasound device accurately assess spleen size .</detailed_description>
