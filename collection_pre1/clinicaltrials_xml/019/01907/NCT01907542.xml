	<brief_summary>Background Stapled skin closure frequently perform follow open colectomies . However , pain cosmetic outcome suboptimal . Monocryl suture skin closure show cosmetically superior require removal suture . But association wound infection question Aims This study aim compare outcome use skin stapler Monocryl suture skin closure follow open colectomy . Hypotheses We believe Monocryl suture associate reduce pain well cosmesis . Methodology Inclusion criterion : All patient underwent elective open colectomy various etiology Exclusion criterion : ) Emergency laparotomies ii ) Patient require creation stoma After consent trial , patient randomize either skin stapler Monocryl suture group . Randomization perform use computer model . To minimize confounders , pre-operative preparation antibiotic regime standardize . The closure fascia skin also perform least Registrar . The wound cover thick sterile dress blind patient research assistant . The wound review POD 3 . The patient schedule return POD 14 , POD 30 , 3 6 month post operatively upon discharge . Some variable collect study include : 1 . Time take skin closure 2 . Superficial surgical site infection 3 . Pain score 4 . Cosmesis We aim enrol 72 participant group . Importance/Impact Medicine This study validate role Monocryl suture effective method skin closure follow open colectomy . We believe Monocryl suture closure potentially change practice surgeon worldwide benefit patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Comparing Stapled Versus Monocryl Sutured Skin Closure Elective Open Colectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology All consecutive patient schedule undergo elective open laparotomy colecotomies cancer/diverticular disease would invite participate study write consent . These patient would randomize 2 arm , stapler skin closure ( n= 72 ) continuous absorbable skin closure ( n= 72 ) . Patients involve study would skin closure do adequately trained surgeon . Inclusion criteria 1 . Patients preoperative diagnosis require abdominal surgery single incision , open laparotomy technique , determine preoperatively attend surgeon . 2 . Age 21 , able understand information regard study . 3 . Agreeable randomization sign consent form . 4 . All elective open colonic resection level peritoneal reflection . Exclusion criteria 1 . Patients know allergy product . 2 . Pregnant woman breast-feeding mother . 3 . No signed consent form . 4 . Patients undergo Low Anterior Resection distal resection margin low mid rectum . 5 . Patients require stoma fashion . 6 . Patients previous midline laparotomy . Randomization If patient fulfils selection criterion , surgical team must explain nature study provide patient Patient Information Sheet Consent Form . The patient must sign Patient Information Sheet Consent Form . A copy Patient Information Sheet give patient sign copy Patient Information Sheet Consent Form must return Principal Investigator filing . Randomization perform use computer model generator skin closure technique would elude surgeon time closure . The operating surgeon would contact designate research assistant reveal allocation . Pre-operative preparation All patient participate trial would comply keep Nil By Mouth 12midnight day surgery . Bowel preparation per preference individual surgeon . Preparation Wound Closure Instruments product require technique closure prepare operating theatre nurse prior operation . The stapling device use would PROXIMATE PLUS MD Skin Staple速 . Absorbable 4-0 Monocryl速 1/2-circle curve needle suture would use skin closure . Both product Ethicon , Johnson &amp; Johnson routinely use hospital . Surgical Technique Surgery perform consistent manner : 1 . Prophylactic antibiotic give patient per hospital protocol . 2 . Clean drape chlorhexidine Povidone 3 . Manner skin incision , dissection , entry abdominal cavity ensue procedure abdominal surgery leave operating surgeon . 4 . Peritoneal cavity irrigate warm water prior closure . 5 . Abdominal fascia close use mass closure technique continuous 1-0 PDS . 6 . The wound close fascia must lavaged adequately chlorhexidine solution . 7 . According randomization skin closure perform use either skin staple Monocryl速 follow way : 1 . For staple skin closure , staple place 1.0cm apart appose entire length wound . 2 . For continuous absorbable suture skin closure , 4-0 Monocryl速 use , initial anchor stitch . Subsequently stitch make within dermis layer skin , catch subcutaenous fat process . 8. local anaethesia use completion closure . For technique , complete apposition throughout entire length wound achieve , check registrar another assistant . No drain place subcutaneous fat layer wound . Time wound closure define time stapler stitch contact patient 's skin till time last staple fire final cut make suture technique . Time wound closure record . All surgical wound would dress Opsite dress mask 2 layer sterile gauze adequately cover entire length wound POD 3 . All patient receive PCA morphine post operative analgesia . additional oral paracetamol administer PCA morphine adequately control pain . Post-operative Assessment The post-operative assessment wound carry independent assessor , single train wound nurse , accord data entry form . This dress would remove till POD3 wound inspection dress change ward nurse immediately type dress patient view wound . Staples would remove POD10-14 uncomplicated . If participant study cohort require form re-operation within study period , he/she would exclude analysis minimise confounders study 's outcome . Wound assessment include : 1 . Superficial Surgical Site Infection ( SSI ) ( within POD30 ) 2 . Rates wind dehiscence ( within POD30 ) 3 . Need re-intervention due Superficial SSI/dehiscence ( within POD30 , within 6/12 post-op ) 4 . Pain 1 . Amount duration ( opoid ) analgesia require 2 . Visual analog scale ( POD1 , 3 , 14 , 30 ) 3 . SF-8 4 week recall questionaire ( POD 30 ) 5 . Comesis . Patient scar assessment scale ( POD14 , POD30 , 3/12 , 6/12 ) Pain assessment would conduct double blinded manner POD1 3 assessor ( research assistant ) patient would know patient 's allocation . After staple remove POD10 wound dress remove POD3 , patient would know allocation assessor would still , thus , pain assessment POD14 POD 30 would single blind . Superficial SSI shall define infection occur within 30 day operation infection involve skin subcutaneous tissue incision least one following : 1 . Purulent drainage , without laboratory confirmation , superficial incision . 2 . Organisms isolate aseptically obtained culture fluid tissue superficial incision . 3 . At least one follow sign symptoms infection : pain tenderness , localize swelling , redness , heat superficial incision deliberately open surgeon , unless incision culture-negative . Upon discharge , study participant schedule return least two visit - first visit POD 14 , POD 30 , 3 month 6 month post operatively . The patient 's wound assess independent assessor visit .</detailed_description>
