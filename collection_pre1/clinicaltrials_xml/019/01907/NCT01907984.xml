	<brief_summary>Purpose : According proposal International Headache Society acute postcraniotomy headache ( PCH ) define headache variable intensity , serious site surgical intervention develop within 7 day craniotomy . Typically , pain resolve within 3 month surgery . According literature incidence acute PCH postoperative period 60 % among patient undergo elective craniotomy . No standardized international guideline available treatment PCH present day . Treatment method different base country institution use , even physicians individually distinct medication regime , sometimes happen habitual lack clinical evidence . The Department Anesthesiology Intensive Care Medicine University Debrecen give 100 mg diclofenac analgesic purpose , part premedication neurosurgical patient several year . It observe postoperative headache follow craniotomy milder compare data publish international literature . A pilot study carry similar setting find incidence PCH low less analgesic require without unwanted side-effects among patient receive 100 mg diclofenac part premedication . Hypothesis : 100 mg preoperatively give diclofenac significantly reduce incidence severity postcraniotomy headache .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before surgery , every patient 's previous history take routinely along , special attention pay history preoperative headache , severity analgesic use regularly prior surgery . In study 200 cooperative adult ( 18 year ) undergo elective craniotomy randomly assign two group : 100 patient receive 7.5 mg midazolam 100 mg diclofenac premedication , 100 member control group receive 7.5 mg midazolam one hour prior surgery . Envelop randomization use schedule patient diclofenac placebo group . Neither anesthetist , physician obtain postoperative VAS score aware actual patient 's grouping ( diclofenac placebo ) entire study . For induction anesthesia , use propofol ( 1-2,5 mg/kgBW ) , whereas maintenance anesthesia use combination fentanyl , rocuronium , sevoflurane . Craniotomy open dura occur always tissue saturation sevoflurane low-flow anesthetic technique apply sevoflurane concentration range 1.2 2.1 V % required maintenance adequate anesthesia . Fentanyl administer initial bolus 100-150 µg follow maintenance dose 2 µg/kgBW/h . The total dose fentanyl calculate offline procedure case . The surgical site infiltrate combination 2 % lidocaine epinephrine case . All patient admit neurosurgical ICU postoperative observation . A stepwise analgesic regimen decide prior study . Severity pain assess regularly ICU nurse additional analgesic use patient complain headache severity VAS &gt; 3 . In case additional paracetamol ( 1-2 g give intravenously ) administer . If effective , additional dose 100 mg diclofenac give patient . In case ineffectivity , tramadol administer dose 100 mg per o iv . At end study cumulative dose analgesic administer patient calculate . For sake clarity transform analgesic dos equianalgetic dos intramuscular morphine accord table Oxford Pain Site value use comparison analgesic requirement . Pain assessment occur bedrest state use 0-10 scaled visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Assessment actual VAS score regularly perform nurse neurosurgical ICU day 1-5 rescue analgesic give accord actual needs patient . An independent physician ( unaware randomization ) perform additional check VAS score ask patient , her/his bad pain day . As patient 's satisfaction consider dependent bad pain , VAS score use analysis . The investigator intend answer follow study question : - Our research intend examine whether 100 mg preoperatively give diclofenac reduces incidence severity PCH first fifth postoperative day . - Is difference incidence severity PCH patient underwent infra- supratentorial intervention ? - Does 100 mg preoperatively give diclofenac reduce intraoperative postoperative analgesic need ? - Does 100 mg preoperatively give diclofenac increase incidence postoperative hemorrhagic event ? Grouping patient : The anesthesiologist duty assign participant randomly control diclofenac group use envelope randomization technique day surgery . Members control group receive 7.5 mg midazolam , member diclofenac group receive 7.5 mg midazolam 100 mg diclofenac premedication . Gathering data : Since objective method exist measure pain patient ask rate headache subjectively help visual analog scale , 0 stand pain 10 intolerable pain . In order make interpretation data easier scale divide three part : 1 3 headache mild , 4 6 moderate , 7 great value represent particularly strong pain . The site surgical intervention , intra- postoperative analgesic need , postoperative complication record individually onto personal data sheet . Each data mention registered third pre-trained , independent ( blind ) member study team , unaware premedication group patient . Statistical method : Statistical analysis perform use Statistica Windows ( Statsoft , Tulsa , USA ) statistical program . A normality test reveal data VAS score analgesic requirement show non-normal distribution , therefore non-parametric Mann-Whitney test use comparison . A p-value &lt; 0.05 accept statistically significant analysis .</detailed_description>
