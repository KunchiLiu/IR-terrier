	<brief_summary>Cerebrovascular disease major cause disability worldwide . The catastrophic burden stroke dramatic low- middle- income country , scarcity evidence-based rehabilitation intervention represent major challenge global health care . Upper limb weakness frequent stroke , universally accept treatment effectively improve hand function patient moderate severe motor impairment . These patient deepest need rehabilitative intervention . This project address important issue , test effect novel approach . We non-invasively stimulate brain peripheral nerve order enhance effect motor train aid electrical stimulation device patient moderate severe hand weakness . Our hypothesis brain stimulation , add peripheral nerve stimulation , enhance effect motor train great extent brain stimulation alone , peripheral stimulation alone , stimulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Brain Peripheral Nerve Stimulation Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study compare effect FES close association either transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) alone , peripheral nerve stimulation ( PNS ) alone , tDCS + PNS sham tDCS + sham PNS , patient moderate severe upper limb weakness , cross-over design . The working hypothesis proof-of-principle study either tDCS PNS enhance effect functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) great extent placebo tDCS PNS , combination tDCS PNS improve motor outcome either tDCS PNS alone . The intervention consist outpatient motor training paretic wrist FES four experimental session separate two week . In session , either active tDCS + sham PNS , active PNS + sham tDCS , active tDCS + active PNS sham tDCS + sham PNS apply . PNS apply 2 hour tDCS apply last 20 minute completion PNS . The order session randomize across patient . Before first session , patient familiarize FES device .</detailed_description>
