	<brief_summary>As treatment liver disease availability liver transplantation progress , number patient end stage liver disease continue increase . This increase need risk-stratify patient cirrhosis well direct treatment provide accurate prognosis outcome . The traditional assessment liver patient limit imaging , static measure `` liver function test '' liver biopsy . This protocol design increase spectrum test evaluation patient end stage liver disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantitative Liver Function Tests Using Cholates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve use dual cholate test quantitative liver function test choice . Clearance oral cholate provide assessment portal blood flow . Clearance intravenous ( IV ) cholate provide assessment systemic blood flow . The ratio clearance indicate fraction cholate shunt systemic circulation , call cholate shunt fraction.2 This study measure cholate elimination rate constant ( cholate Kelim ) , clearance orally administer cholate , clearance intravenously administer cholate cholate shunt . This study compare presence extent cholate clearance shunt fraction presence extent hepatic fibrosis portal hypertension ( measure hepatic venous pressure gradient [ HVPG ] procedure . ) The patient enrol study may may undergo clinically indicate hepatic venous pressure gradient ( HVPG ) measurement Baylor University Medical Center , without liver biopsy . Patients HVPG measurement admit Baylor University Medical Center ( BUMC ) prepare routine clinical fashion clinically-indicated HVPG measurement . The cholate test , include blood draw , perform HVPG procedure . The cholate test may also perform Hepatology clinic</detailed_description>
