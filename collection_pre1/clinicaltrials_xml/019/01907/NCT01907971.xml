	<brief_summary>Ebstein anomaly rare congenital heart disease . It encompass abnormality tricuspid valve , right atrium right ventricle ( RV ) . Currently , cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) consider method choice assessment RV volume function . To evaluate right heart function VentriPoint method design assess RV fraction time , result well efficacy low cost . VentriPoint approve Tetralogy Fallot patient well patient systemic RV d-transposition great artery . This method use 2 dimensional standard ultrasound view link VentriPoint Medical Systems unit . After acquisition , physician identifies anatomical landmark dot number 2D ultrasound view heart . With sensor ( magnetic tracking system : GPS ) ultrasound probe know 2D plane 3D space . In way precise anatomical landmark locate 3D space . The aim present study assess feasibility , reliability accuracy echocardiographic knowledge-based 3D reconstruction method measure RV volume function patient Ebstein anomaly . The accuracy method assess comparison measurement obtain cardiac MRI . In addition right ventricle investigator want ass leave ventricular function patient Ebstein anomaly study . By use speckle track echocardiography investigator would like investigate leave ventricular contractility , rotation synchrony leave ventricle together RV . Not seldom left ventricle neglect patient Ebstein anomaly impressive finding right ventricle . Changes myocardial leave ventricular structure ( non compaction ) also describe may negative impact function . The investigator want analyze 25-30 patient Ebstein anomaly include child start 11 year age .</brief_summary>
