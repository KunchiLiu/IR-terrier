	<brief_title>Trametinib Akt Inhibitor GSK2141795 Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient achieve complete remission ( CR ) CR incomplete recovery platelet ( CRp ) best response within 4 cycle therapy trametinib combination GSK2141795 ( Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient rat sarcoma ( RAS ) mutation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine disease-free survival patient achieve CR/CRp . II . To determine duration response patient achieve CR/CRp . III . To determine toxicity profile trametinib combination GSK2141795 patient population . IV . To determine biologic effect trametinib combination GSK2141795 leukemia cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week .</detailed_description>
