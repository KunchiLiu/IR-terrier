	<brief_summary>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) abnormal dilatation aorta abdomen secondary hypertension atherosclerosis . Surgical treatment AAA increasingly replace endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) use stent-grafts ( SGs ) . However , efficacy less invasive approach often jeopardized incidence persistent flow within aneurysm , call endoleaks lead aneurysm rupture properly detect treat . Hence , life long annual CT-scan surveillance require increase cost EVAR , expose patient ionize radiation nephrotoxic contrast agent . The goal project adapt test new ultrasound technology call ultrasound elastography improve patient follow-up EVAR ultimately avoid use CT-scans . This technique measure deformation tissue secondary blood pressure variation ( quasi-static elastography ) shear wave generate ultrasound probe ( dynamic elastography ) . The investigator optimize 2 approach generate elastic map AAA . One approach quasi-static elastography ( QSE-LSME ) technique develop team give estimation deformation ( strain ) different component AAA blood pressure . The second dynamic elastography ( SSWI ) technique provide information elastic property AAA component .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental protocol : Optimization validation 2 technique complete 3 experimental phase : 1 . Preclinical validation : Abdominal aortic aneurysm EVAR without endoleak ( n=6 ) , type I ( n=6 ) type II ( n=6 ) endoleak create 18 mongrel dog . QSE-LSME SSWI acquisition acquire SG insertion 48H , 1 , 3 month sacrifice 6 month . The 2 technique optimize generate strain ( QSE-LSME ) elasticity ( SSWI ) measurement simulate thrombus vessel wall . CT-scan prospective gating acquire AAA least 6 different cardiac phase segment allow 2D/3D registration CT elastographic acquisition . Strain ( QSE-LSME ) elasticity ( SSWI ) measurement sac thrombus vessel wall compare three experimental group correlate sac pressure measurement , CT segmentation sac component pathologic evaluation . 2 . Clinical feasibility , reproducibility correlation CT-angiography . From EVAR database , 3 group 15 patient select base clinical CT-angiography evolution . Group 1 include patient without endoleak AAA volume decrease 20 % follow EVAR , group 2 patient without endoleak 10 % sac volume variation group 3 patient endoleak endotension 20 % sac volume increase . Ultrasound B-mode RF acquisition QSE-LSME SSWI technique acquire two independent investigator . We compare strain value different AAA component three group . Thresholds test detect endoleak . Then strain value correlate diameter , volume stretch index variation baseline contemporary CT scan . 3 . Prospective study validation strain elasticity threshold endoleak detection characterization thrombus organization . The goal second clinical feasibility study collect longitudinal strain elasticity measurement early post EVAR period ( one-year ) . We include 15 patient AAA schedule EVAR . These patient baseline CT baseline QSE-LSME SSWI examination . Doppler ultrasound QSE-LSME SSWI examination perform 3 12 month . The variation strain elastic value time frame analyze correlated volume progression endoleak occurrence CT scan .</detailed_description>
