	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare ovarian cancer screening , risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy ( RRSO ) , prophylactic salpingectomy delay oophorectomy ( PSDO ) . The safety RRSO PSDO also study . Ovarian cancer screen involve surgical procedure . Instead , physical exam , blood test , ultrasound use check ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer . The surgical procedure , RRSO PSDO , design low risk ovarian cancer . In RRSO , fallopian tube ovary remove time . In PSDO , fallopian tube remove ovary remain place patient go menopause . The ovary remove later date . The main goal study learn many patient actually ovaries remove later date . Researchers also want learn whether removal fallopian tube decrease risk ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Salpingectomy With Delayed Oophorectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 3 option : ovarian cancer screening , PSDO , RRSO . You may choose study group want take part . However , must let researcher know choice test study begin . The 3 study group describe detail . GROUP 1 : OVARIAN CANCER SCREENING : Study Visits : For group , test require start study . If agree Group 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - You transvaginal ultrasound ( ultrasound inside vagina ) look ovary fallopian tube . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw measure CA125 level . This test use screen ovarian cancer . - You complete questionnaire quality life . This take 15 minute . Every 6 month 3 year : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw CA-125 testing . - You transvaginal ultrasound look ovary fallopian tube . At end Years 1 , 2 , 3 , complete quality-of-life questionnaire . All test result discuss . If test result abnormal , study doctor may ask additional testing , may include CA-125 testing , ultrasound , and/or compute tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . If result show cancer , study doctor refer gynecologic oncologist ( doctor woman 's cancer ) and/or recommend ovary fallopian tube remove . Length Study : You may study visit 3 year . You take study early develop cancer unable follow study direction . At time preferably end 3 year , option cross choose one treatment option ( Group 2 3 ) . Follow-Up : One ( 1 ) time year last study visit long need , study staff contact phone , e-mail , letter ask change medical history . If call , call last 5 minute . GROUP 2 : FALLOPIAN TUBE REMOVAL WITH DELAYED OVARY REMOVAL ( PSDO ) : Salpingectomy : If find eligible take part study Group 2 , study doctor discus salpingectomy surgery detail , include risk possible benefit . You ask sign surgical consent form . After , salpingectomy schedule . Most patient salpingectomy performed outpatient procedure . This mean likely go home day surgery . If study doctor plan stay overnight hospital reason , discuss . During surgery , inside abdomen look fallopian tube remove . If study doctor find anything surgery may cancerous , tissue sample complete ovary remove surgery test . If cancer find , gynecologic oncologist would perform cancer surgery . Post-Salpingectomy Follow-Up : The study staff call 1 day 1 week surgery ask . The call last 5 minute . One ( 1 ) month surgery : - You physical exam , include exam surgical incision ( wound ) . - You complete quality-of-life questionnaire . The pathology ( tissue ) result surgery discuss either 1-week phone call 1-month visit . If result show cancer , study doctor refer gynecologic oncologist . Ovarian Cancer Screening Period : Every 6 month delay oophorectomy salpingectomy : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw CA-125 testing . - You transvaginal ultrasound look ovary . You complete quality-of-life questionnaire 1 time year 1 year delay oophorectomy . Pre-Oophorectomy Testing : After 3-year screening period , pre-oophorectomy visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test CA-125 testing . - You transvaginal ultrasound look ovary , do last 6 month . - You complete quality-of-life questionnaire , do last 6 month . - You may test perform study doctor think need . Oophorectomy : If pre-surgical test normal , study doctor discus plan surgery detail , include risk possible benefit . You ask sign surgical consent form . After , oophorectomy schedule . Most patient oophorectomy performed outpatient procedure . This mean likely go home day surgery . If study doctor plan stay overnight hospital reason , discuss . During surgery , inside abdomen look ovary remove . If study doctor find anything surgery may cancerous , tissue sample remove surgery test . Post-Oophorectomy Follow-Up : The study staff call 1 day 1 week surgery ask . One ( 1 ) month surgery : - You physical exam , include exam surgical incision . - You complete quality-of-life questionnaire . The pathology result surgery discuss either 1-week phone call 1-month visit . If result show cancer , study doctor refer gynecologic oncologist . At 6 month 1 year surgery , complete quality-of-life questionnaire . At 1 year surgery : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw CA-125 testing . All test result discuss . If test result abnormal , study doctor may ask additional testing , may include CA-125 testing , ultrasound , and/or CT scan MRI . If result show cancer , study doctor refer gynecologic oncologist . Length Study : You study visit 1 year oophorectomy . You take study early develop cancer unable follow study direction . Follow-Up : One ( 1 ) time year last study visit long need , study staff contact phone , e-mail , letter ask change medical history . GROUP 3 : REMOVAL OF FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES AT THE SAME TIME ( RRSO ) : RRSO : If find eligible take part study Group 3 , study doctor discus surgery detail , include risk possible benefit . You ask sign surgical consent form . After , RRSO schedule . Most patient RRSO perform outpatient procedure . This mean likely go home day surgery . If study doctor plan stay overnight hospital reason , discuss . During surgery , inside abdomen look ovary fallopian tube remove . If study doctor find anything surgery may cancerous , tissue sample remove surgery test . The pathology result surgery discuss either 1-week phone call 1-month visit . If result show cancer , study doctor refer gynecologic oncologist . Post-Surgery Follow-Up : The study staff call 1 day 1 week surgery ask . One ( 1 ) month surgery : - You physical exam , include exam surgical incision . - You complete quality-of-life questionnaire . The pathology result surgery discuss either 1-week phone call 1-month visit . If result show cancer , study doctor refer gynecologic oncologist . At 6 month 1 year surgery , complete quality-of-life questionnaire . At 1 year surgery : - You physical exam , include pelvic exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw measure CA-125 . All test result discuss . If test result abnormal , study doctor may ask additional testing , may include CA-125 testing , ultrasound , and/or CT scan MRI . If result show cancer , study doctor refer gynecologic oncologist . Length Study : You study visit 1 year surgery . You take study early develop cancer unable follow study direction . Follow-Up : One ( 1 ) time year last study visit long need , study staff contact phone , e-mail , letter ask change medical history . This investigational study . At time , know method may lower risk ovarian cancer ovary fallopian tube remove ( RRSO ) . Screening ovarian cancer low risk develop cancer . PSDO previously study may lower ovarian cancer risk . PSDO currently use research purpose . Up 80 woman take part multicenter study . Up 60 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
