	<brief_summary>In recent year become evident type antidepressant associate increase risk fall decrease bone mineral density . These factor predispose patient serious fracture hip fracture substantial morbidity mortality . The specific mechanism involve negative impact bone postural control fully elucidate . It well know Vitamin D play important role bone health well muscle function thus indirectly postural control . Furthermore , vitamin D deficiency observe among depressed patient . To knowledge study investigated involvement Vitamin D relation increase risk fracture associate antidepressant . Therefore , project investigate underlie mechanism lead skeletal impairment musculoskeletal symptom patient receive different type antidepressant . Moreover , effect vitamin D supplementation investigate among patient take antidepressant . 150 subject participate study : 50 diagnosed depression receive Citalopram ( SSRIs ) ; 50 depressed subject receive Mirtazapine ( NaSRI ) ; 50 control . Through randomisation half subject group receive daily Vitamin D supplementation period one year . Through period 150 subject follow different measurement include bone density , muscle function balance , nociception , quality life depression severity . It expect result study provide increase awareness knowledge side effect profile antidepressant bone metabolism . This may prompt clinician screen patient high risk drug-induced osteopenia osteoporosis accordingly provide treatment , may reduce incidence potentially avoidable fracture . Moreover , type antidepressant may show produce minimal even effect bone turnover , consider first line treatment group patient risk fracture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Antidepressants widespread use , 460.000 people Denmark receive type treatment ( `` Statens Serum Institut - Statistikker , '' 2012 ) . Despite advance medical treatment depression last decade , recent study show association antidepressant Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ( SSRIs ) increase risk fall decrease bone mineral density , result increased risk bone fracture . As SSRIs prescribe first line treatment depression , side effect could detrimental effect several patient . Residual symptoms tiredness , muscle weakness muscle pain observe patient treated antidepressant . It yet know residual symptom depression , negative effect skeleton may mediate via decreased level vitamin D. Any decrease vitamin D may mediate either antidepressant due depression per se ( decreased exposure sunlight poor dietary habit ) . The treatment antidepressant may improve depression , may correct vitamin D deficiency leave residual symptom , may interpret depression-related incomplete response antidepressant treatment . Treatment vitamin D may thus help alleviate symptom otherwise attribute depression lead treatment antidepressant ( confound indication ) . Alternatively , antidepressant may interfere biological process affect uptake metabolism Vitamin D result low level vitamin D may detrimental effect bone turnover muscle function . State-of-the-art For antidepressant difference observe SSRI new antidepressant . SSRI associate decreased bone mineral density increase risk fracture , whereas newer antidepressant increase risk fracture see , little known effect bone density bone turnover . This concern widespread use . The effect SSRI may mediate via direct serotoninergic effect bone cell SSRIs new antidepressant may affect cardiovascular system , may increase risk fall . The increase risk fall may perhaps also related muscle weakness stem vitamin D deficiency effect central nervous system affect postural balance . The risk fall may explain early increase risk fracture , whereas effect bone density may increase long-term risk fracture . In depressed patient reduce physical activity may also affect bone via disuse osteoporosis . It thus clear association previously observe antidepressant detrimental skeletal effect may mediate underlie disease ( depression ) , factor relate drug . Perspectives relevance community If cheap simple treatment vitamin D may improve quality life musculoskeletal status among depressed patient , may e.g . bring many patient back work thus contribute significantly public health . Moreover , information regard influence SSRIs bone turnover relative postural control contribute significantly unravelling mechanism affect negatively different SSRIs lead increase risk fracture . This finally contribute well understanding side effect profile drug hence enable good management clinic . This great value , since , state earlier , large group patient receive class drug . Formulation problem In recent year become evident type antidepressant deleterious effect bone metabolism serious clinical consequence increase risk fracture possibly subsequent complication . Moreover , majority patient treat antidepressant residual symptom include tiredness , muscle weakness muscle pain , similar symptom vitamin D deficiency . Increasing awareness knowledge side effect profile antidepressant bone metabolism may prompt clinician screen patient high risk drug-induced osteopenia osteoporosis accordingly provide treatment , may reduce incidence potentially avoidable fracture . Moreover , type antidepressant may show produce minimal even effect bone turnover , consider first line treatment group patient risk fracture . Therefore , study , consist cross-sectional longitudinal study design , address follow aims biochemical clinical characterisation : 1 ) unravel underlie mechanism lead skeletal impairment musculoskeletal symptom alteration sensory-motor interaction ( impaired balance ) patient receive different type antidepressant ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) new antidepressant 2 ) investigate effect co-administrating vitamin D bone status , sensory-motor interaction , parameter associate quality life depression randomise controlled clinical trial . Hypotheses : - Decreased level Vitamin D may cause depression behavioural change ( less time outdoors thus sun-exposure , poor dietary habit ) - Certain type antidepressant may alter level Vitamin D negative effect musculoskeletal system ( residual symptom ) measurable effect postural control bone mineral density ( BMD ) . - Decreased vitamin D level may lead musculoskeletal symptom correct treatment depression antidepressant ( Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ( SSRIs ) Noradrenergic specific serotonergic Antidepressants ( NaSSAs ) ) . - By supplement vitamin D musculoskeletal symptom disruption bone status may correct . - The increase risk fracture either cause SSRIs ' effect postural control thus fall incidence decrease BMD , result .</detailed_description>
