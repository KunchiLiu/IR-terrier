	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well radiation therapy docetaxel work treat patient human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -related oropharyngeal cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving radiation therapy docetaxel kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess cumulative incidence local/regional failure 2 year study registration . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize rate acute grade 3 high functional mucosal adverse event ( 1 month post-radiation therapy [ XRT ] ) associate adjuvant docetaxel + hyperfractionated radiotherapy ( key secondary endpoint ) . II . To assess change overall survival , disease-free survival , distant failure rate , quality life ( QOL ) associate adjuvant docetaxel hyperfractionated radiation . III . To characterize acute adverse event ( 1 month post-XRT ) late grade 3 high non-hematologic adverse event ( 2 year post-XRT ) associate adjuvant docetaxel + hyperfractionated radiotherapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine genetic alteration oropharynx tumor specimen detection rate correspond cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid ( cfDNA ) pre-surgical , post-surgical , post-radiation blood oropharynx cancer patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 8 undergo hyperfractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) twice daily ( BID ) 5 day week day 1-12 total 20 fraction . After completion study treatment , patient follow 14 day , 1 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
