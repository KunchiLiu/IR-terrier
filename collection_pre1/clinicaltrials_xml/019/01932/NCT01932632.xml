	<brief_title>Medication Minimization Long-term Care Residents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People live residential care typically elderly often complex co-morbid illness expect improve unable manage home . Many patient prescribed multiple medication : 1. treat individual condition 2. theoretically prevent unwanted sequela chronic condition and/or 3. treat side effect medication give ) b ) . Advancing age find significant factor adverse drug event polypharmacy find stand alone risk factor high mortality morbidity . However , British Columbia , average number medication take patient residential care 9 , range 0-55 ( hospital reporting data , specific reference pending ) . Frail elder often treat chronic disease use publish guideline symptom modification prevention despite fact guideline able include convince evidence efficacy frail elder population . Despite available knowledge possible harm adverse effect age , polypharmacy lack appropriate population-specific evidence , many residential care patient medication stop taper . The lack change may explain admit physician ' belief appropriate evidence reluctance stop medication start specialist . Other research also suggest little experience/education many physician medication address exactly stop/taper medication , and/or concern/belief patient family fear care provider `` give '' patient relegate her/him quicker death . Medication review point admission residential care facility typically result significant reduction number medication dose reduction . However , promise initial study look formalized approach medication discontinuation minimization well review ethic program ( 23 ) . In 2007 prospective cohort study , Garfinkel et al able demonstrate reduction 1-year mortality ( 45 % control 21 % study group , p &lt; 0.001 , chi-square test ) , few transfer acute care ( 30 % control 11.8 % study group , p &lt; 0.002 ) well reduction cost medication . I propose randomize control study medication minimization residential care patient . I use modified version `` GP-GP protocol '' develop Garfinkel , et al randomly assign patient either `` medication prescribe usual '' medication minimization protocol . To see reduce polypharmacy ( i.e . number dosage medication ) elder live residential care increase time admission death ( i.e . improve mortality ) reduce number transfer acute care ( i.e . improve morbidity ) .</detailed_description>
