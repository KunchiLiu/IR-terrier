	<brief_summary>Even center large experience , risk cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) leakage surgery microvascular decompression report 3 % . Prevention leakage important since meningitis may follow . Also , leakage usually mean long hospital stay increase cost . In case detect leakage extra suture may apply , placement lumbar drain may consider revision improved closure may attempt . With leakage subcutaneous tissue , skin , local accumulation cause local symptom may also occur . In addition burdensome associate longer hospital stay possible revision surgery , complication also costly . The best way reduce cost burden , improve patient care , prevent CSF leakage . The aim study determine prophylactic lumbar tap beneficial prevention cerebrospinal fluid leakage follow microvascular decompression , comparison surgical approach 3 geographical area Scandinavian health system . Hypothesis : There difference cerebrospinal fluid leakage group subject prophylactic spinal tap versus group without prophylactic spinal tap .</brief_summary>
