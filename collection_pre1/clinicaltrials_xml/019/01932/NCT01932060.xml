	<brief_title>Oxytocin Infusions Blood Loss Patients Undergoing Elective Cesarean Delivery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxytocin ( pitocin ) drug commonly use obstetric practice , drug effect increase muscular tone uterus reduce uterine bleed neonatal delivery . Pregnant patient undergo elective ( schedule ) Cesarean delivery routinely receive oxytocin delivery baby . Post-delivery , oxytocin commonly administer IV bolus and/or infusion . No previous study accurately assess difference oxytocin infusion delivery patient undergo elective cesarean delivery .
