	<brief_summary>Near infra-red spectroscopy ( NIRS ) use measure tissue perfusion cerebral cortex two noninvasive adhesive patch recent year . This study design compare regional tissue perfusion different body area patient receive coronary artery bypass surgery general anesthesia . The NIRS data also use compare routine physiological monitor surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Near Infra-red Spectroscopy Measure Tissue Perfusion Patients Receiving Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : Prospective observational study Target Number Participants : To recruit 50 patient study . Patient Selection : 1 . Patients schedule elective coronary artery bypass surgery . 2 . The American Society Anesthesiologists physical status classification system ( ASA ) Class I~III 3 . Age ≧20 y/o , ≦75 y/o Exclusion Criteria : 1 . ASA Class IV 2 . Current skin lesion sit NIRS patch design attach . 3 . Patients receive cardiopulmonary bypass surgery . 4 . Patients previous history allergy NIRS patch . Study Method : After induction anesthesia , four NIRS patch attach patient follow site : 1 . Biceps brachii muscle area 2 . Gastrocnemius muscle area 3 . Posterior side neck 4. central part forehead The four non-invasive NIRS patch measure tissue oxygen saturation physiological effect participant . The data collect every 5 minute surgery complete . The data routine monitor use surgery ( include hear rate , blood pressure , mixed venous saturation ) also use compare data NIRS .</detailed_description>
