	<brief_summary>A randomized , open-label single-center study investigate efficacy safety bilateral renal artery sympathetic denervation catheter-based radiofrequency ablation blood pressure disease progression control autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) . The total number study subject 100 . All diagnose ADPKD hypertension . Patients randomize 1:1 ( 50 radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , 50 drug ) . Change average office-based measurement systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , average 24-hour systolic blood pressure ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) , incidence office systolic blood pressure reduction ≥10 , ≥15 ≥20 mm Hg , office diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) , number dosage blood pressure tablet , total kidney volume ( TKV ) , total cyst volume ( TCV ) , pain related cystic kidney renal function , assess 12 month follow-up . The safety variable assess every visit follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients ADPKD . Having hypertension , define systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg , currently use 2 antihypertensive drug receive stable antihypertensive treatment regimen without change dose medication previous 30 day . Male female patient 20 year 60 year age . Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m2 , estimate serum creatinine use Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology collaboration ( CKDEPI ) equation . Have followedup kidney cyst volume least 6 month Shanghai Changzheng Hospital . Signed Informed Consent inform . Documented renal vascular disease . Congenital absence kidney . Systemic illness renal involvement . Spot urine albumintocreatinine ratio &gt; 0.5 g/g and/or finding suggestive kidney disease ADPKD . Exclusions specific MRI acquisition measurement : cardiac pacemaker , presence MRI incompatible metallic clip material , excessive body weight , untreatable claustrophobia . Contraindications catheterbased renal denervation procedure RFA , include allergy radioiodinated contrast agent . Anatomical abnormality renal artery preclude RFA : presence either kidney multiple main renal artery , main renal artery stenosis &gt; 50 % , main renal artery &lt; 4 mm diameter &lt; 20 mm length . Contraindications ethical ground . Women pregnant breast feeding . Intention become pregnant course study . Lack safe contraception : Female subject childbearing potential , use willing continue use medically reliable method contraception entire study duration , oral , injectable , implantable contraceptive , intrauterine contraceptive device , use method consider sufficiently reliable investigator individual case ( Female subject surgically sterilized/hysterectomized postmenopausal longer 2 year consider child bear potential ) . Other clinically significant concomitant disease state ( hepatic dysfunction , cardiovascular disease , metastatic cancer ) . Known suspected noncompliance , drug alcohol abuse . Inability follow procedure study , e.g . due language problem , psychological disorder , dementia confusional state subject .
