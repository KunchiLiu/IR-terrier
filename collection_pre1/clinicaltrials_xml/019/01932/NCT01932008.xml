	<brief_summary>The purpose study : ( 1 ) compare body composition , physical activity , physical function , quality life patient without CKD CABG ; ( 2 ) analyze relationship among body composition , physical activity , physical function population . It expect patient CABG CKD bad body composition , physical function , quality life patient CABG without CKD ; patient higher physical activity level well body composition , physical function , quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It report cardiac disease renal disease frequently coexist . Recently , term cardiorenal syndrome use describe interaction heart kidney . Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) become increasingly recognize independent risk factor cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular disease one severe complication patient CKD . Previous study show change body composition , physical inactivity , decrease physical function , poor quality life exist patient either cardiovascular disease CKD . Patients concomitant cardiovascular disease kidney insufficiency expect significantly increase physical dysfunction . However , study address alteration patient coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) CKD report .</detailed_description>
