	<brief_summary>There cure Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) always look new way stop disease process and/or promote repair . We hypothesise autologous bone marrow cellular therapy chronic MS offer durable benefit . The purpose study test safety repeat bone marrow stem cell infusion patient MS. We want find effect , good and/or bad , disability . You previously participate safety study bone marrow stem cell infusion patient MS . The result raise possibility early partial repair ; measurement speed neurological impulse brain spinal cord improve . The current study seek determine whether benefit persist whether repeat enhance repeating procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repeat Infusion Autologous Bone Marrow Cells Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On background others ' experimental BM stem cell study , recently complete phase 1 feasibility/safety trial BM cell therapy 6 patient longstanding progressive MS ( www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v87/n6/full/clpt201044a.html ) . Safety confirm , intensive serial neurophysiological test show statistically significant improvement 12 month . While highly preliminary entirely uncontrolled , result least raise possibility beneficial effect within damage central nervous system ( CNS ) . A phase 2 clinical trial formally assess efficacy intravenous infusion autologous bone marrow cell progressive MS commence near future ( ACTiMuS trial ) . This trial comprise programme translational clinical stem cell research , aim ( 1 ) continue translation phase two control trial autologous bone marrow cell ( BMCs ) chronic MS ; ( 2 ) explore parallel potential mechanism action study BM cell treat patient control , aim establish BM sub-population ( ) contribute ( ) efficacy , reparative mechanism ( ) important . It know whether repeat infusion autologous bone marrow offer additional benefit long improvement might expect last . The current proposal seek explore whether neurophysiological improvement observe phase I study persist several year initial single infusion whether either replicate augmented additional infusion autologous bone marrow cell . Hypothesis aim We hypothesise intravenously-delivered autologous bone marrow cellular therapy ( BMCT ) chronic MS offer significant benefit . We hypothesize also mechanisms multiple , include immunomodulation reparative and/or neuroprotective effect within CNS ; offer one BM stem cell sub-populations , jointly contribute therapeutic impact . Exploring understanding mechanism , biology cell responsible , allow development effective reparative cell therapy MS . The current study seek examine whether observed improvement note conduction time central nervous system pathways phase I 'Study Intravenous Autologous Marrow Multiple Sclerosis ( SIAMMS ) ' persist several year follow initial single infusion whether either replicate augmented additional infusion autologous bone marrow cell analysis research sample perform per sample include concurrent phase 2 clinical trial 'Assessment bone marrow-derived cellular therapy progressive multiple sclerosis ( ACTiMuS ) ' ( REC 12/SW/0358 , ISRCTN27232902 , NCT01815632 ) .</detailed_description>
