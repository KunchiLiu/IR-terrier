	<brief_title>Abciximab ( ReoPro ) Therapeutic Intervention Sickle Cell Vaso-Occlusive Pain Crisis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) one common genetic disease worldwide , affect approximately 1 500 African-Americans 1 1000 Hispanic-Americans . A single amino acid substitution decrease solubility deoxygenate hemoglobin , lead polymer formation subsequent distortion erythrocyte shape normal biconcave disc relatively rigid crescent sickle shape . Initially reversible , polymer formation shape distortion eventually become permanent . Clinical manifestation sickle cell disease relate increase clearance misshapen erythrocyte ( cause chronic hemolytic anemia ) well occlusion small ( sometimes large ) blood vessel . Vaso-occlusive phenomenon responsible much acute morbidity sickle cell disease , include episode pain result bone infarct , splenic infarction secondary increase risk infection , relatively high incidence ischemic stroke ( ~10 % first 2 decade life ) . In addition , chronic cumulative ischemic episode contribute long-term morbidity ( include avascular necrosis bone , retinopathy , renal insufficiency , pulmonary hypertension ) significantly shorten life span . Vaso-occlusive pain crisis often require hospitalization administration parenteral narcotic ; average duration hospitalization 4-5 day , significant proportion patient experience multiple crisis per year . In episode , pain continue intensify first 2-3 day begin abate , suggest ongoing extension tissue damage time follow initiation episode ; also , many patient develop additional focus pain even course hospitalization . While direct mechanical blockage small vessel sickled erythrocyte undoubtedly important factor vaso-occlusion , secondary phenomenon likely contribute episode , include increase erythrocyte adhesion endothelium post-capillary venule . SCD patient also exhibit chronic pro-coagulation change soluble clot factor , well increased platelet number activation . The relative contribution various change pathophysiology vaso-occlusive crisis unclear . One publish study show antiplatelet drug ticlopidine decrease frequency , duration , severity pain crisis SCD patient , suggest increase platelet activation indeed contribute vaso-occlusion . Current therapy vaso-occlusive pain crisis mostly supportive ( maintain adequate hydration oxygenation administer pain medication ) . With possible exception exchange transfusion—a procedure significant potential morbidity—there therapy directly target vaso-occlusion . Abciximab ( ReoPro ) Fab fragment chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody 7E3 . It avidly bind glycoprotein IIb/IIIa integrin αvβ3 , would potentially inhibit erythrocyte bind vascular endothelial well platelet adhesion , thus target two separate mechanism felt component vaso-occlusive phenomenon SCD . The relatively prolonged course pain crises—which typically involve increase intensity pain often development new area pain first days—suggests treatment early phase crisis might effective ameliorate course episode , result decrease acute morbidity possibly also less long-term tissue damage . The study hypothesis administration abciximab early course vaso-occlusive sickle cell pain crisis reduce median length hospitalization without accompany increase bleed serious complication . Participants randomize double blind fashion receive either abciximab ( ReoPro ) placebo intravenously 12 hour . Randomization stratify sickle cell genotype : Sickle Cell Anemia ( SS ) vs. Sickle-Hemoglobin C Disease ( SC ) . All patient receive standard supportive care , include hydration , supplemental oxygen need maintain oxygen saturation &gt; 92 % , schedule use NSAIDS , narcotic titrate effect .</detailed_description>
