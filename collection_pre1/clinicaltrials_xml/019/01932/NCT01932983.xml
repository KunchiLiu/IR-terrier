	<brief_summary>The study examine clinical application TOF ( train four test ) use anesthesiologist neurophysiologists instrument spine procedure , well certain associate parameter . 'Train four ' test test routinely use surgery , perform stimulation peripheral nerve purpose determine degree muscle relaxation interpretation muscle response . During spine surgery , helpful surgeon patient 's muscle relax possible least amount tone , especially expose . Anesthesiologists achieve level relaxation give neuromuscular blocking agent . If medication give fully left system time surgeon need start put screw rod , intraoperative monitoring adequately perform . If muscle relax , free run EMG screw stimulation , two monitoring method use , analyze correctly surgery may adversely affect . This study compare result 'train four ' test perform neurophysiologists anesthesiologist . Additionally , look difference , , compare stimulation foot nerve ( tibial n. ) hand nerve ( ulnar n. ) Performing TOF ( train four test ) low extremity relevant many reason . Train four test show presence four twitch arm leg may fully recover muscle relaxant give anesthesia . Also , train four test use subjective method interpretation anesthesiologist may present different result compare objective quantitative method train four test interpretation . Ultimately , goal study show importance 'TOF ' test ensure identifiable preventable intraoperative surgical complication appropriately identify .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TOF test perform two routinely used device , peripheral nerve stimulator intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring device . TOF monitor upper extremity include stimulation ulnar nerve . Negative surface electrode place wrist line small digit 1-2cm skin crease positive 2-3cm proximal negative electrode . Active surface record electrode place adductor pollicis muscle . TOF monitor low extremity include stimulation peripheral nerve , posterior tibial nerve . Surface stimulate electrode place , negative inferolateral aspect medial malleolus , positive electrode 2-3cm proximal negative electrode . Stimulation current 20-30 mA hand 30-60mA foot TOF group 0.2 millisecond pulse , space 500 millisecond apart , deliver four contraction . Surface record electrode use measure muscle response foot , active electrode locate Flexor hallucis brevis muscle reference big toe . Intraoperative monitoring device use , software TOF monitoring programe instal . EMG response calculate peak amplitude ( peak peak amplitude ) present quantitative value online measurement . Interpretation different , visual subjective . Peripheral nerve stimulator use subjective TOF test . Output current adjustable 0 70 mA . Repeat stimulation 4 pulses/0.2 millisecond repeat every 500 millisecond . Surface negative electrode place course ulnar nerve wrist , line small digit , 1-2cm proximal skin crease , positive electrode 2-3 cm proximal . Response follow adductor pollicis muscle . All data keep electronic medical record data complete subject include study . Results compare TOF method two different body site , upper low extremity , quantitative method comparison make subjective quantitative method TOF test locate method upper extremity .</detailed_description>
