	<brief_summary>Patients leukemia often low white blood cell count chemotherapy , put great risk infection . The standard care prevent infection give patient antibiotic , antifungal , antiviral drug time white blood cell count low . However , many patient still develop infection chemotherapy . Radiated white blood cell transfusion standard treatment patient develop severe infection . The goal clinical research study learn give white blood cell transfusion radiate early chemotherapy might delay prevent infection patient leukemia . Researchers also want learn type severity infection occur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study Prophylactic White Blood Cell Transfusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedures : During white blood cell transfusion , receive white blood cell volunteer donor needle vein . Each transfusion take anywhere 1 hour several hour , depend tolerate treatment . You receive transfusion approximately every 3-4 day ( 2 week ) 6 week . Before white blood cell transfusion , vital sign ( temperature , heart rate , breathe rate , blood pressure ) record accord standard evaluation patient fever look underlie infectious cause . During 1 hour transfusion , monitor side effect . You may give drug help reduce side effect . Your doctor tell drug may give side effect . If point develop fever study , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect check infection accord standard evaluation patient fever look underlie infectious cause . You may also chest x-ray . If abnormal symptom ( cough , shortness breath , nasal congestion ) , may need compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest and/or sinus . That do within 3 day develop fever . If doctor think need , another CT scan 2 week later point doctor think need check infection . Length Study : You continue transfusion doctor think infection control white blood cell count stay certain level least 2 day row . If point discharge hospital doctor want continue receive white blood cell transfusion , able receive outpatient . You monitor side effect sign infection 6 week . You take study intolerable side effect . This investigational study . Radiated white blood cell transfusion consider standard procedure treatment serious infection . It investigational give unirradiated white blood cell transfusion way prevent infection . Up 50 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Patients undergo initial therapy disease undergo first salvage treatment , i.e . patient fail therapy , respond relapse initial therapy . 3 . Patients free sign symptom infection time enter study , importantly , encourage sufficient donor administer prophylactic white cell transfusion twice week six week order ass effectiveness . 1 .
