	<brief_summary>A feasibility Study Evaluate Safety Initial Effectiveness ExAblate Transcranial MR Guided Focused Ultrasound Unilateral Thalamotomy Treatment Tremor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ExAblate ( Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery ) Treatment Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The non-invasive high-intensity focus ultrasound couple high resolution MRI provide precise , consistent treatment monitor real-time . The development phase array transducer allow tightly focus treatment volume ability compensate distortion tissue inhomogeneity . The landmark advance MRgFUS neurosurgeon occur ability sonicate intact cranium achieve phased array transducer acoustic model use CT reconstruction skull . By couple HIFU MRI , detail treatment plan generate intra-procedure real-time monitoring available . Standard MR sequence show reliably predict tissue damage thermal lesioning ultrasound . The precision technology already demonstrate animal model currently investigate human brain tumor neuropathic pain syndrome . Unlike stereotactic radiosurgery , treatment monitor continuously real time MRI MR-thermography . We anticipate MRgFUS non-invasive thermal lesioning similarly safe DBS ( current procedure provide several year benefit reduction contralateral motor symptom potential medication side effect ET , still permit subsequent treatment DBS become clinically desirable .</detailed_description>
