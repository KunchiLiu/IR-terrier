	<brief_summary>This study quantify motion occur socket interface transhumeral prosthesis user common task . Participants study use body powered prosthesis hosmer hook terminal device . A motion analysis system novel optical sensor embed socket wall record amount movement residual limb socket prosthesis . Participants complete range motion functional task . The range motion task include shoulder flexion , abduction rotation well elbow flexion . The functional task include bilateral lift weight basket , unilateral lift weight handle , box block test , walk carry gallon milk , fold towel . It expect weight terminal device rotation interface , well slip residual limb device . It also expect soft tissue residual limb model nonlinear spring amount movement interface predict base force system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participation study begin socket duplication stage/initial test phase end week later second collection day complete . Subjects meet individually PI lab test day one socket duplicate initial testing . Socket duplication consist fill inside volume socket plaster mixture form positive mold . Once set , positive mold remove used contractor form clear thermoplastic socket . After mold make , subject perform series task record 8 camera Vicon motion analysis system 2 digital video camera . Thirty reflective marker place subject use adhesive collar . There slight risk skin irritation due adhesive tape , similar wear Band-Aid . Some discomfort may arise remove marker . A tight fitting shirt worn participant limit undesired motion marker due loose clothing . Subjects complete : - Range Motion Trials ( without prosthesis ) The Range Motion ( ROM ) trial include shoulder flexion/extension , shoulder abduction/adduction , shoulder rotation . Each RoM task repeat three time . - Trinity Amputation Prosthesis Experience Scales ( TAPES ) - This questionnaire look different aspect use prosthesis . - Results questionnaire compare performance laboratory set see correlation user rate device perform . The first collection day last 1-2 hour . For second collection day , subject randomize group A B determine order socket test data collection second day . Subjects group A use original prosthesis first collection group B subject use duplicate socket prosthesis . Subjects switch socket second collection session . The second day expect last 3-4 hour . Each session consist follow : - Range Motion Trials ( prosthesis ) The RoM trial include shoulder flexion/extension , shoulder abduction/adduction , shoulder rotation , elbow flexion/extension . Each RoM task repeat three time . - Functional Tasks - Unilateral lift - Subject pick place series weight one spot 3 ' high shelf another spot 3 ' away shelf . The participant must hold object shelf ( drag object ) transfer weight object vary 5 25lbs 5lbs increment . - Amount movement socket interface time complete transfer evaluate use task . We expect socket interface movement - Bilateral lift - Subject lift basket contain series weight floor 3 ' high shelf , back original position . The weight basket vary 10 50lbs 10lbs increment . - Maximum load transfer , time complete transfer evaluate use task . We expect time complete task translate ability appropriately position devise . Weight lift serve strength control unilateral lift . - Walk Carry - Participants walk treadmill 1 minute carry 15 pound bag . - The amount slip socket rotation record . - Cut play-dough knife fork - Participants sit front table plate play-dough . Participants allow pick use knife fork however desire , must cut play dough three roughly even piece . This task repeat 3 time . - The time complete task , hand use hold knife , use determine capability dexterous manipulation . - Folding towel - Participants stand bath towel lay flat table . Subjects fold towel half lengthwise , half widthwise , half lengthwise . This task repeat 3 time . - The time complete task use determine capability dexterous manipulation . - Modified Box Blocks Test - 16 block place 4 row one side box partition middle . The objective move one block time side go partition . Participants instructed start low right corner complete row move next . Subjects move block match spot opposite half box . Participants 1 minute move many block . Participants repeat task 4 time . The box start place block start side participant prosthesis . - Outcomes test include number block move allotted time time require move 16 block , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
