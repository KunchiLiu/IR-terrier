	<brief_title>Preventing Health Disparities During Pregnancy Through Vitamin D Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project , comprise discrete study , expert evaluation translation public health campaign , promote racial health equity pregnant woman . A strong racial disparity US surround vitamin D status : African American woman 20-fold Hispanic woman 2.4-fold great risk deficiency Caucasian woman . In South Carolina , great 70 % African American , 33 % Hispanic 12 % Caucasian pregnant woman meet Institute Medicine 's ( IOM 's ) 2010 definition vitamin D deficiency ( 1-3 ) . Such disparity basis race/ethnicity represent serious public health issue . Yet , some—including IOM—argue vitamin D deficiency minimally affect maternal fetal health vitamin D supplementation study show improved pregnancy outcome ( 3 , 4 ) . Results two recently complete vitamin D trial involve 510 pregnant woman throughout pregnancy suggest otherwise ( 5-7 ) . In NICHD trial , woman supplement 400 IU vitamin D/day ( amount prenatal vitamin ) vs. 2000 4000 IU/day bad vitamin D status throughout pregnancy , combine high risk comorbidities pregnancy ( gestational diabetes , hypertensive disorder , infection , preterm labor/birth periodontal inflammation ) ( 7 ) . In trial 2 , woman two South Carolina community health center supplement vitamin D , high vitamin D status associate low comorbidities pregnancy risk ( 6 , 8 ) . A novel finding NICHD trial serum level active , hormonal vitamin D ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ) pregnancy optimize twice level normally observe non-pregnant woman , level would consider toxic nonpregnant individual . At time life relationship exist . Is hormone level drive vital process pregnancy ? If , process ? There hint 1,25 ( OH ) 2D elevate pregnant woman . During pregnancy , maternal immune system undergoes drastic change fetal protection . For example , solid organ compose 50 % mismatch cell marker ( antigen ) transplant new host , would reject within hour ; however , fetus 50 % mismatch paternal antigen protect immune destruction process know immune privilege . During pregnancy body increase immune suppressive cell , reduces highly activate natural killer cytotoxic T-cells capacity destroy fetus still capacity fight foreign pathogen . While mechanisms orchestrate complex balance unknown , hypothesize due vitamin D 's ability regulate immune cell , vitamin D responsible many immune alteration associate fetal immune privilege . We hypothesize correction vitamin D deficiency pregnancy protect immune-mediated disorder recurrent miscarriage , preterm birth , bacterial infection , periodontal inflammation gestational diabetes . This premise , test confirm project , lead public policy change equality vitamin D status pregnancy . To test validity hypothesis , goal project follow : The central goal project realize racial equity pregnant woman develop baby US . To achieve goal , 3 specific objective : 1 . Determine vitamin D deficiency lead immune imbalance subsequent disparity pregnancy health outcome ; 2 . Determine vitamin D supplementation prevents imbalance disparity ; 3 . Translate finding public health policy . By compare woman diverse racial/ethnic background receive current vitamin D IOM standard 400 IU/day compare 4000 IU/day [ daily dose show achieve optimal production active vitamin D hormone ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ) ] , clear effect vitamin D realize . Furthermore , effect sufficient vitamin D pregnancy transcend racial difference woman . Study Design : This randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial 450 pregnant woman enrol 10-14 week gestation follow delivery . Following write , informed consent , mother randomize receive either placebo 4000 IU/day vitamin D3 plus standard prenatal vitamin ( contain 400 IU vitamin D3 ) . She follow monthly total nine study visit . These visit include initial recruitment mother 10-14 week pregnancy , monthly study visit , delivery study visit , 18-month post-partum follow-up visit mother child . The primary outcome variable maternal neonatal health status function maternal infant vitamin D status . Secondary outcome variable analyze , function maternal vitamin D status pregnancy include : T-lymphocyte profile , immune function indicator , neonatal growth , inflammatory cytokine profile , methylation pattern DNA mother neonate , 1 . Subject Selection Criteria Recruitment : Any mother ( 18-45 year age ) present obstetrician midwife Medical University SC ( MUSC ) , Charleston , SC ; Our Lady Mercy , Johns Island , SC ; Franklin C. Fetter , Charleston , SC obstetrical facility within first 14 week last menstrual period ( LMP ) confirmation singleton pregnancy eligible enrollment study . Mothers diverse ethnic background ( African-American , Asian , Caucasian Hispanic ) actively recruit . A database generate weekly undelivered patient labor delivery staff continue alert staff impend admission . 2 . Exclusion Criteria : Mothers pre-existing calcium , uncontrolled thyroid disease , parathyroid condition , require chronic diuretic cardiac medication therapy include calcium channel blocker eligible enrollment study . Mothers pre-existing sickle cell disease ( trait ) , sarcoidosis , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis may participate study . In addition , potentially confound effect multiple fetus , mother multiple gestation eligible participation study . A sub-group approximately 100 subject know diabetes , hypertension , HIV , morbid obesity ( body mass index &gt; 49 ) participate study . 3 . Subject Enrollment : The potential study subject 's primary care provider make first contact behalf study refer interested mother study personnel information invitation . Upon enrollment study , expectant mother approximately 10-14 week ' gestation randomize receive one two treatment regimen vitamin D3 . They randomize 1 2 group : ( 1 ) Group A : 400 IU vitamin D3/day—Standard dose treatment placebo ( 0 IU vitamin D3 ) plus prenatal vitamin ( 400 IU/day ) ; ( 2 ) Group B : 4,400 IU/day ( 4,000 IU/2 gummies/day + 400 IU/day prenatal ) . If , 3 month vitamin D supplementation , mother still frankly vitamin D deficient ( le 15 ng/ml ) , receive open label active vitamin D gummies remainder pregnancy . To attain equal group number ( n=150 ) balance number racial/ethnic group ( African-American , Caucasian Hispanic , represent predominant group deliver MUSC ) , stratify block randomization use . 4 . Race/Ethnicity Defined : Each mother ask define racial/ethnic group belongs : ( ) African-American , ( b ) Caucasian , ( c ) Hispanic , ( ) American Indian , ( e ) Asian , ( f ) . Because mother American Indian ( 0.08 % delivery ) Asian ( 1 % delivery ) descent deliver MUSC , insufficient power include group study . In addition , mother , self-report , ask define race/ethnicity parent father baby parent . 5 . Study Site Population : The Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) urban medical university Charleston , SC serve patient predominantly Charleston Tri-County area ( 80 % ) 20 % surround region South Carolina . We perform 2000 delivery year . The ethnic composition obstetrical population 57 % African American , 36 % Caucasian , 6 % Hispanic 1 % Asian . Franklin C. Fetter Our Lady Mercy Clinics primarily see Hispanic patient prenatal care . These Hispanics prenatal care coverage provide Roper Hospital , Roper St. Francis Healthcare , Charleston , SC grant include approximately 150 delivery per year Roper Hospital . MUSC provide care woman present labor require routine care refer outlying hospital due high-risk pregnancy delivery Regional Perinatal Center ( RPC ) appropriate , regardless ability pay . 6 .

Conduct ongoing monitor interventional trial appropriate expertise accomplish trial 's mission : The MUSC clinical lab require notify PI critical lab value . The Study Coordinators responsible check laboratory woman within 72 hour report enter laboratory data computer . They provide set normative laboratory value reference . The Clinical PI review value weekly study meeting notify value fall outside referent value range . All data verify independently Data Processing Center direction Dr. Hulsey . The DSMC notify via telephone fax source document adverse report sheet subject 's value fall outside referent value range . In addition , adverse event review quarterly DSMC , whose report forward Kellogg Foundation quarterly basis IRB yearly . The Investigators report Serious Adverse Events telephone IRB DSMC ; addition , IRB , DSMC , Kellogg Foundation receive write report within 10 day Clinical Investigators ' knowledge Event . In addition , investigator generate quarterly report DSMC regard subject enrollment , subject completion , adverse event serious adverse event . The DSMC review report summary letter finding send IRB . Interim Data Analyses &amp; Monitoring : Interim analysis evaluation safety efficacy conduct base recommendation Data Safety &amp; Monitoring Board . The DSMC serve monitor safety efficacy . DSMB report produce Dr. Hulsey 's team include summary statistic : mother recruitment ( expect vs. actual ) , data form quality ( completion timeliness form ) ; track data edit ; demographic randomize mother ; aggregate safety ; aggregate efficacy ; relate information . The DSMB also monitor trial standpoint futility use technique Lan Wittes ( 119 ) . First , differences loss follow-up miss visit compare six comparison group detect potential bias ( 400 IU group stratify race : African American , Hispanic Caucasian ; 4000 IU group also stratify race ) . The big problem unbalanced loss loss statistical power . We aggressively attempt avoid loss monitor adherence visit . In event differential loss ethnic group supplementation group , conduct statistical test ascertain whether random bias . Random loss report affect outcome . Biased , non-random , loss assess potential impact difference outcomes . If necessary , conduct propensity score analysis control statistically significant difference non-random loss . Following , difference compliance supplementation compare 'intent-to-treat ' design . Any significant deviation protocol consider subsequent analysis . In section , report : ( 1 ) deviation protocol ; ( 2 ) outcome comparison use efficacy design test true difference associate subject adhere protocol ; , ( 3 ) outcome comparison use intent treat ( effectiveness ) design test actual difference might expect non-controlled intervention . This help determine whether type supplementation could expect effective apply general population . Next , vitamin D level study entrance ( 10-14 week ' gestational age ) establish baseline supplementation group . It expect baseline difference group . Because expect difference ethnic group ( account stratification ) , mean vitamin D baseline compare two-way analysis variance ( ethnicity experimental group ) . In step 3 , use repeat measure analysis variance , change vitamin D describe separately ethnic group within supplement group . This depict separately ethnic group change vitamin D time function level supplementation . This method reveal soon supplementation change blood ( baseline ) detect , linear change blood vitamin D time , peak level ( plateau ) attain . Adjusted difference examine use multiple regression without inclusion covariates . Regression coefficient provide formula linear association vitamin D blood time , separately ethnic group . In event non-linear change time , appropriate data transformation occur necessary . This step also provide information magnitude importance covariates play change vitamin D time within ethnic group . As example , may find seasonality play significant role change vitamin D Caucasian woman association strong African American woman . Further , association may become similarly unimportant high level supplementation . The next series analysis compare difference vitamin D supplement group time ethnic group . This accomplished use two-way ( ethnicity supplementation group ) repeat measure analysis variance . This technique detect significant difference main effect ( ethnic group supplementation group ) interaction effect ( ethnicity supplementation ) change vitamin D time . Multiple regression also use examine change without use potential confounders . In secondary analysis , multi-level mixed-effects model use estimate average individual monthly rate change 25 ( OH ) D , compare rate dose group , explore effect covariates rate change . These model include fix effect dose group , time , group-time interaction , random intercept effect , additional covariate effect require . Time consider continuous variable , measured month rather assume structure visit occurrence . An unstructured covariance matrix assume . The multi-level modeling approach also use evaluate longitudinal association 25 ( OH ) D safety parameter calcium , iPTH ( log-transformed ) , phosphorus , urinary calcium , creatinine , calcium : creatinine level . The cumulative occurrence pregnancy complication preterm labor infection compare dose group level use logistic regression . All analysis perform use SAS ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary NC ) . Participant attrition miss data : Because primary endpoint study change 25 ( OH ) D baseline delivery , primary analysis restrict participant remain study delivery provide blood sample within 6 week prior delivery , delivery , post-delivery visit ( completers-only analysis ) . Typically , multiple imputation would use impute miss value support favor intention-to-treat analytic approach . Because multiple imputation model analysis would require variable also measure final blood sample , however , use impute case miss final blood sample . Thus , assess primary finding ' robustness assumption miss data , perform sensitivity analysis . Missing data impute following condition : case miss endpoint experienced change group ; experience group-specific median change observe completers ; experience change 400 IU group minimal change 4000 IU group . In secondary analysis use multi-level mixed-effects model longitudinal modeling , available data point use , necessary delete case miss timepoints use approach .</detailed_description>
