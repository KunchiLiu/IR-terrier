	<brief_summary>■ Unmet medical need Refractory cancer Conquest - Many advanced cancer still detect Despite remarkable technological advance early diagnosis cancer field last 20 year . In type progressive carcinoma high malignancy despite variety therapeutic target treatment refractory cancer . The refractory cancer patient main focus research define adult solid tumor patient fail standard therapy accord criterion NCCN / ASCO ( American Society imsangam ) / KCSG ( Study Group chemotherapy ) . The survival rate refractory cancer patient estimate 30-40 % total patient metastatic solid tumor refractory cancer difficult deal control conventional treatment show almost close 100 % mortality . Therefore new development therapy conquer refractory cancer urgently require . ■ Preclinical translational research Unmet Needs Bio-new drug development conquer refractory cancer - The stage preclinical translational research ( Translational Research ) connect early stage development clinical trial stage drug development . The establishment foundation base translational research necessary must prove ability treat refractory cancer . The anti-cancer drug develop exist preclinical test method actually show remarkable effect many case clinical trial , even show remarkable inhibitory cancer effect animal testing . The exact molecular diagnosis treat target paradigm development new drug time require target treatment . The tailor cell line patient proven technology animal model unmet need preclinical translational research increase</brief_summary>
