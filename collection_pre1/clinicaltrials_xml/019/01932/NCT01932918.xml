	<detailed_description>Our team focus study reperfusion injury liver transplantation , lung resection open heart surgery need cardiopulmonary bypass . Previous clinical observation show increase lung water liver transplant recipient . Some patient may even develop pulmonary edema lengthen intensive care unit stay hospital stay , also increase morbidity mortality . In hepatic ischemia reperfusion animal model , prove release large amount reactive oxygen specie play important part remote lung injury . If propofol , possess free radical scavenger property , give adequately , production reactive oxygen specie decrease thus reduce extent remote lung injury . In another clinical study , find resume two lung ventilation one lung ventilation induces massive superoxide production , also could reduce use propofol maintenance anesthesia . Postoperative pain cause surgery-associated tissue injury major concern clinical practitioner . Because affect multiple system induces physiological , immunological psychological change . Previous literature show surgical injury induces systemic inflammatory metabolic-endocrine response proportional severity surgical stress . In surgery liver transplantation , patient suffer postoperative pain also additional oxidative stress cause ischemia reperfusion . Previous report prove adequate postoperative pain control improve recovery reduces inflammatory cascade suppression physiological psychological stress . However , effect postoperative pain management ischemia reperfusion injury unclear far . In three year study , plan continue previous study test follow two hypothesis : ( 1 ) postoperative pain exacerbate remote organ injury cause ischemia reperfusion , ( 2 ) interaction different antinociceptive modality ischemia reperfusion injury . In first part , plan use animal model already establish test analgesic reduce inflammatory response remote lung injury cause hepatic ischemia study different antinociceptive modality result different consequence . In second part , recruit patient receive liver transplantation , lung resection open heart surgery need cardiopulmonary bypass study interaction nociception various antinociceptive modality ischemia reperfusion injury .</detailed_description>
