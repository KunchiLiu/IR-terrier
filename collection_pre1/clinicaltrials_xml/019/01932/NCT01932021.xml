	<brief_summary>The hypertensive leg ulcer painful leg relate acute skin microangiopathy . It occur patient old 60 year follow hypertension . Clinical diagnosis require eliminate cause arterial ulcer , cryoglobulinemia , thrombophilia , cholesterol crystal embolus , vasculitis associate hepatitis C , myeloproliferative disorder ulcer associate Hydrea ® outlet . There treatment ulcer conventional treatment ineffective . The pain subside analgesic III . Other treatment effective outside skin graft repeat necrotic regularly . In prospective uncontrolled study , 11 patient heal autohemotherapy . Ineffective treatment painful condition efficiency cell damage tissue , due secretion many bioactive molecule , lead u propose subcutaneous injection autologous fat change wound bed , promote heal eliminate pain . This treatment help avoid long-term hospitalization ( 15 day ) lead physical psychological degradation elderly patient . The investigator propose open clinical study 10 patient single-center recruitment ( CHU Caen ) . The study take place period 18 month 12-month recruitment follow-up 6 month patient . The purpose study evaluate one hand , tolerance , term pain side effect , , hand , effectiveness therapeutic approach , term heal ulcer assume decrease size estimate least 40 % 3 month wound . The measure effectiveness also focus change appearance wound , include relative area fibrin , necrosis budding . These efficiency measure ( area ratio ) do computer program ( CANVAS ® ) photograph take assessment time . Eventually , study demonstrate effectiveness treatment lipofilling , would possible perform multicenter study large number patient demonstrate effectiveness , term wind heal pain cause offer short hospital stay , parallel , approach improve pathophysiology ulceration ( translational research ) .</brief_summary>
