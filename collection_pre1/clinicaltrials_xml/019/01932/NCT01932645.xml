	<detailed_description>Prostatitis widespread disease affect people youths senior , approximately third experience remission symptom year follow-up . Although etiology prostatitis still clear , mainly think due infection bacteria microorganism . Traditional technique identify bacteria ( e.g . agar petri plate ) limit identify . Although HMP ( Human Microbiome Project ) turn many mystery common sense , little do relationship bacteria prostate prostatitis . Up , still research do microbiome ( bacterial specie ) prostate . The objective study look etiology chronic prostatitis ( bacteria non-bacteria prostatitis ) , mainly focus effect bacteria prostate . Modern sequence method , 16 rRNA amplification , clone sequence use evaluate role bacteria prostatitis . The basic idea survey microbe present express prostatic fluid use 16 sequence compare healthy men prostatitis patient small cohort see correlation microbes find symptom .</detailed_description>
