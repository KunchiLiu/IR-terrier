	<brief_title>Acute Kidney Injury Septic Critically Ill Patients : Are Aminoglycosides Really Harmful ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis septic shock despite recent advance survive sepsis campaign remain encumbered high mortality rate close 30 % . One cornerstone management patient remain early appropriate antibiotic administration , , must also active site infection . Aminoglycosides often administer combination beta lactams context . According progress pharmacokinetic management achieve past decade , safety efficiency tend increase many uncertainty remain . The purpose present study determine whether administration aminoglycosides septic critically ill patient risk factor acute kidney injury . Study design : This open retrospective monocentric cohort study include septic critically ill patient november 2008 january 2010 . To determine incidence specific risk nephrotoxicity aminoglycosides , hospitalize patient without initial acute kidney injury rapidly improve kidney function three first day included.Primary outcome occurrence acute kidney injury assess RIFLE classification ( Risk , Injury , Failure , Loss , End-stage kidney disease ) day 4 day 15 . Patients receive aminoglycosides compare control group , i.e . receive . We estimate hazard ratio ( HR ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) adjust propensity score ( PS ) -matched Cox-proportional hazard model .</detailed_description>
