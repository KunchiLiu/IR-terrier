	<brief_summary>After first cardiovascular event , considerable risk develop subsequent event . Only recently , risk prediction model develop group patient . Imaging technique coronary artery calcium score contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CT ) coronary carotid artery could able add improve model . Imaging may improve prediction future manifestation arterial disease personalize disease monitoring treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The SMART-ORACLE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients prior cardiovascular event exhibit elevate risk subsequent cardiovascular event . The Second Manifestation Arterial Disease Study ( SMART ) recruit 10,000 patient since 1996 clinically manifest cardiovascular disease multidisciplinary single center study involve primary care physician , cardiologist , neurologist , vascular surgeon , vascular medicine specialist radiologist . Within study prediction model develop accurately estimate risk new cardiovascular event . It possible acquire high-quality motion-free compute tomography ( CT ) image coronary carotid artery . Imaging biomarkers extract image may improve prediction future manifestation arterial disease personalize disease monitor medical care . The SMART-ORACLE study prospective , single center , observational cohort study aim include 1500 patient . The primary aim identify predictor future cardiovascular event . Eligible patient select via recruitment original SMART study . Patients participate SMART-ORACLE study undergo calcium score multiple cardiovascular bed contrast-enhanced CT-scans coronary carotid artery addition regular SMART investigation . Patients renal dysfunction either exclude study receive pre-hydration ( depend eGFR ) minimize risk contrast nephropathy . Follow-up questionnaire-based assessment take place every 26 week death participant end SMART study , ask participant possible new cardiovascular event . Endpoints adjudicate committee three expert . The aim collect 170 future event . The main analysis consist Cox proportional hazard analysis . Imaging biomarkers add exist prediction model ass ( independent ) discriminatory capacity future event . The c-statistic used measure discrimination model . Net reclassification improvement table construct evaluate add value image marker term reclassification . Based one-year-occurrence rate subsequent cardiovascular event current SMART population database 2.6 % , 6500 person year follow-up need obtain adequate number endpoint .</detailed_description>
