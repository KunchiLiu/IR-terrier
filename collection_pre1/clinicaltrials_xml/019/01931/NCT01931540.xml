	<brief_summary>The prevalence obesity develop world increase markedly last 20 year . Considering prevalence obese overweight adult subject , fact pregnancy induces state insulin resistance inflammation , maternal obesity may common health risk develop fetus . It well establish eat major impact health . However , grow evidence suggest diet pregnancy lactation may particularly important influence health mother , may permanent effect health child even grandchild . The concept environmental factor , nutrition early development , influence health span lifespan term developmental origin health disease hypothesis . The objective study : - compare subject frailty ( condition develop age ) control characterize unhealthy age condition measurement describe - examine sign frailty reverse lifestyle induced modification ( exercise training programme ) primary component ( IR , sarcopenia , psychological profile ) offspring overweight/obese ( OOM ) vs lean mother ( OLM ) . The study consist 37 frail old subject , age â‰¥ 65 sub-grouped 17 OOM , 20 OLM 11 non frail control . These subject study positron emission tomography ( PET ) , compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) spectroscopy ( MRS ) ultra sound ( US ) . In addition functional MRI ( fMRI ) perform . Adipose tissue biopsy take . Subjects undergo characterization biohumoral marker , 75 g oral glucose tolerance test , image biomarkers ( PET/CT , US , fMRI-MRS ) , genetic biomarkers ( DNA telomere damage ) inflammatory biomarkers ( macrophage infiltration ) 4-month lifestyle intervention period ( physical exercise ) . By PET/CT measure tissue-specific IR skeletal muscle , adipose tissue , liver , myocardium target brain region . MRS use measure organ steatosis skeletal muscle liver , MRI use measure fat mass abdominal area , fMRI perform assess activation brain region regulate cognition appetite/energy control . US use assess cardiovascular marker ( IMT , strain function ) .</brief_summary>
