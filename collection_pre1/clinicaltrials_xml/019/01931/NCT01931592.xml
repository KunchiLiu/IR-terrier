	<brief_title>Controling Intestinal Colonization With Extended Spectrum ß-Lactamase Producing Enterobacteriaceae ESBL-E</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bloodstream infection ( BSI ) multi-drug resistant ( MDR ) bacteria extended- spectrum betalactamase produce Enterobacteriaceae ( ESBL-E ) associate significant morbidity mortality , particularly immunocompromised patient . In recent year , rapid spread ESBL-E global level observe . While guideline effective infection control treatment measure urgently need , require basis evidence yet generate . Particularly data interventional trial lack . From October 2011 December 2012 , multicenter cohort study ESBL-E colonization infection haematology/oncology patient conduct within Deutsches Zentrum für Infektionsforschung ( DZIF ) allow detailed description epidemiology ESBL-E patient population . Based result , sample size calculation study carry . Rapid rational health-care intervention great importance efficiently combat emergence resistant virulent bacteria . In recent year , spread ESBL-E global level observe . In 2012 , KRINKO ( Kommission für Krankenhaushygiene und Infektionsprävention ) Robert Koch Institute Berlin , German , publish new recommendation management colonization infection Gram-negative MDR bacteria , include ESBL-E . In high-risk setting , e.g . haematology/oncology ward intensive care unit , contact isolation recommend patient colonize infected ESBL-E . While recommendation KRINKO legally bind , many institution integrate suggestion standard care , give recent increase prevalence ESBL-E . This development put considerable strain patient treat physician . Firstly , previous study demonstrate negative impact long-term isolation patient ' frequency contact health care worker , decrease score self-esteem increase score anxiety depression.Secondly , proper contact isolation require treatment single room . Many hospital , however , equip sufficient number single room , accommodate patient carry MDR bacteria . Apart problem associate contact isolation , immunocompromised patient colonize ESBL-E increase risk subsequent bloodstream infection ( BSI ) . Medical care provider use face similar problem deal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) . However , nowadays , eradication regimen offer possibility remove MRSA skin mucosa colonize patient , thus interrupt spread considerable extent . For ESBL-E , effective eradication regimens yet available . The current study therefore aim assess new approach ESBL-E eradication . To avoid administration eradication regimen patient low risk subsequent BSI ESBL-E , study population restrict immunocompromised high-risk patient . The human intestinal tract know colonized hundred different bacterial specie microbes . Based experience fecal microbiota therapy treatment recurrent Clostridium difficile infection , hypothesize intestinal microbiome may influence success failure present study intervention . Thus , select site , metagenomic analysis intestinal microbiome perform explore possible association certain microbiome pattern successful eradication ESBL-E . There ongoing discussion whether antibiotic regimen use eradication selective digestive tract decontamination ( SDD ) might lead emergence multi-drug resistant bacteria.11 Emergence resistance long-term administration SDD ICU patient previously reported.12 However , recently publish meta-analysis , include 64 study ICUs , 47 randomize control trial 35 include data detection antimicrobial resistance , relation use SDD development antimicrobial resistance could detected.13 Even without information , risk emergence resistance classify low , consider patient receive eradication treatment duration seven day . Nevertheless , possible emergence non-ESBL multi-drug resistant bacteria intestine assess study intervention . Concerning choice antibiotic regimen high chance effectively eradicate ESBL-E gut , data previous study take account . Most previous study concept base idea SDD.14-16 SDD aim eradicate abnormal aerobic gram-negative bacteria , preserve anaerobic bacteria . In set , problem adverse event cause systemic effect antibiotic use discard . However , locally active antibiotic use achieve eradication , patient less likely clear concurrent ESBL-E colonization throat , skin urinary bladder . These body site may serve source intestinal re-colonization ESBL-E . Therefore , current pilot study use combination non-absorbable enterally administer antibiotic systemic antibiotic . To facilitate choice optimum non-absorbable antibiotic , antimicrobial susceptibility test clinical isolates ESBL-E haematological high-risk patient carry University Hospital Cologne 2012 . Virtually resistance towards colistin could detect ( data publish ) , colistin choose non-absorbable component . As previous study show promising result combination colistin gentamicin , latter add eradication regimen . Concerning choice systemically active antibiotic , promise data clinical efficacy fosfomycin ESBL-E infection reduction ESBL-E intestinal flora publish . Given additional convenience available oral formulation - prerequisite give ESBL-E active treatment - fosfomycin choose combination oral colistin gentamicin . For treatment urinary tract infection , oral fosfomycin usually administer single dose 3g . However , several study assess treatment complicate chronic urinary tract infection repetitive administration 3g fosfomycin . Since single dose may suffice reduce intestinal ESBL-E burden limit detection , schedule 3g p.o . every 72h chosen study .</detailed_description>
