	<brief_summary>Partial nephrectomy ( kidney removal ) standard therapy clinical T1 renal ( kidney ) tumor . The goal surgery accurately remove tumor cancer cell edge remain tissue , limit blood loss , preserve kidney function . The common technique clamp blood supply entire kidney removal surgically repair tumor bed suture agent stop bleeding . This stop blood supply entire kidney include healthy tissue , cause damage remain tissue due shortage oxygen leave clamp long . This study use microwave pre-coagulation technique use Certus 140™ facilitate bloodless area near tumor accurate tumor removal repair , avoid clamp blood supply , effect function kidney adjacent tumor unknown . If adequate stoppage bleed achieve use Certus 140™ minimal heat spread remain tissue , clamp shortage oxygen avoid . The hypothesis microwave pre-coagulation safe method provide stoppage bleed partial kidney removal .</brief_summary>
