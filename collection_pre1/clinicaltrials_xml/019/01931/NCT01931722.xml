	<brief_summary>Likely , branch chain amino acid ( BCAA ) requirement increase old strength-trained ( ST ) individual . If , supplementation group maximize muscle protein synthesis ( MPS ) minimize loss muscle age ( sarcopenia ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Branched Chain Amino Acids ( BCAA ) Requirements Older Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize dietary requirement branch chain amino acid ( BCAA ) old strength-trained ( ST ) population great current recommendation ( RDA ) . If , great intake BCAA together ST necessary one aim maximize muscle protein synthesis ( MPS ) . Currently , BCAA requirement ST old population ( 55-65 ) unknown . This critical information especially give value ST overall health .</detailed_description>
