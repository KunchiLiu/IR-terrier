	<brief_title>Oral Pazopanib Plus Oral Topotecan Metronomic Antiangiogenic Therapy Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme ( A ) Without Prior Bevacizumab Exposure ( B ) After Failing Prior Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Glioblastoma ( GBM ) common primary brain tumor . With optimal treatment , consist focal radiotherapy concurrent chemotherapy , follow adjuvant chemotherapy , median survival 14.6 month . Most patient evidence tumor progression within one year diagnosis despite treatment . At progression , treatment option limit mostly ineffective . - Recently , bevacizumab approve recurrent GBM patient fail bevacizumab indicate short survival , order 10 week , approximate PFS 3 6 month 0 % . - Pazopanib oral angiogenesis inhibitor target VEGFR , PDGFR , c-Kit , recently FDA approve advanced renal cell carcinoma . - Topotecan orally bioavailable topoisomerase I HIF-1 alpha inhibitor reasonably high CNS/CSF penetration - Recent pre-clinical report begin argue clinical test metronomic chemotherapy administration various cancer . The theory improve activity Pazopanib + Topotecan administer metronomically base target tumor vasculature ( exist capillary endothelial cell circulate bone marrow derive endothelial cell precursor ) , immune modulation , well tumor cell HIF-1 alpha inhibition , induction DNA damage . Further support combination come recent data tie drug-induced VEGF inhibition induction HIF-1 alpha activity GBM suggest possible synergy Pazopanib Topotecan - The combination Topotecan Pazopanib directly demonstrate active animal model Objectives - 6 month progression free survival rate recurrent glioblastoma ( rGBM ) patient prior bevacizumab exposure treat pazopanib topotecan ( Group A ) . - 3 month progression free survival rate rGBM patient prior bevacizumab exposure treat pazopanib topotecan ( Group B ) . Eligibility - Histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) gliosarcoma ( GS ) evidence progression MRI CT scan . - Patient must fail prior chemoradiation temozolomide therapy except BEV ( group A ) , must fail primary chemoradiation BEVincorporating treatment ( group B ) . - Patients must great 12 week follow completion chemoradiation . - Archived tumor tissue must available confirmation diagnosis - Patients must &gt; 18 year old . - Patients must Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 . - Patients must adequate organ function . - No pregnancy lactation . - Patients must significant medical illness investigator opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient ability tolerate therapy . - No history cancer ( except non-melanoma skin cancer carcinoma in-situ cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year eligible . - No clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may increase risk gastrointestinal bleeding include , absorption medication . - No prior major surgery trauma within 28 day and/or presence non-healing wound , fracture , ulcer ( procedure catheter placement consider major ) . - No evidence active bleeding bleed diathesis . - No known endobronchial lesion and/or lesion infiltrate major pulmonary vessel . - No serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical , psychiatric , condition could interfere subject safety , provision inform consent , compliance study procedure . .. No ongoing toxicity prior anti-cancer therapy &gt; Grade 1 and/or progress severity , except alopecia . - No ongoing use enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic agent ( EIAEDs ) , unless 2 week washout elapse form last dose EIAED . - No known hypersensitivity pazopanib topotecan excipients . - No total daily dose dexamethasone great 16 mg/day . - No prior therapy topotecan , pazopanib , relate drug tyrosine kinase inhibitor , VEGF inhibitor ( except bevacizumab ) . Prior treatment TKIs impact VEGFR -1 , -2 , -3 , PDGFR , -b cKIT could allow . Design This 2 arm phase II trial combination topotecan pazopanib patient recurrent GBM GS . Patients enrol one follow group : ( A ) Glioblastoma gliosarcoma prior bevacizumab exposure : ( B ) Glioblastoma gliosarcoma prior bevacizumab exposure . Topotecan pazopanib administer orally daily . The primary efficacy endpoint progression free survival ( PFS ) six month patient registration bevacizumab na ( SqrRoot ) patient PFS 3 month patient prior bevacizumab treatment .</detailed_description>
