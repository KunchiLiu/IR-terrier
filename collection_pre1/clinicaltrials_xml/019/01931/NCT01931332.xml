	<brief_summary>Primary total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) commonly associate moderate severe early post-operative pain . The primary aim study investigate impact either single-shot femoral nerve block ( FNB ) intrathecal diamorphine ( ID ) post-operative pain TKA The Null Hypothesis difference post operative pain relief provide TKA single-shot femoral nerve block ( FNB ) compare intrathecal diamorphine ( ID ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In 2008 , Prospect Working Group , multidisciplinary expert panel , publish consensus guideline relative merit different anaesthetic analgesic technique TKA base review available publish literature 2005 . These guideline support use general anaesthesia combine femoral nerve block surgery postoperative analgesia , alternatively spinal anaesthesia local anaesthetic combine spinal morphine . The preference femoral nerve block favour intrathecal opiate consequence great potential side effect latter technique . The author concede lack well-conducted study subject , grade recommendation level D ( expert opinion ) , conclude research need . Consequently debate around conclusion draw clinician universally accept recommendation . Most researcher date focus short-term outcome static pain score and/or opiate consumption . It also important however investigate dynamic pain score , patient report outcome , attainment rehabilitation goal , length stay long term functional outcome . In addition , use total pain relief score ( TOTPAR ) describe Cooper Beaver , assess cumulative response treatment . This well validated area time-analgesic effect curve ( AUC ) derivation pain relief commonly use meta-analyses analgesic intervention . The aim study investigate endpoint patient receive single-shot femoral nerve block ( FNB ) TKA compare intrathecal diamorphine ( ID ) , commonly use spinal opiate United Kingdom anaesthetic practice .</detailed_description>
