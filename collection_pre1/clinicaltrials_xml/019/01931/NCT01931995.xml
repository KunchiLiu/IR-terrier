	<brief_summary>This research study do gain well understand brain network may involve depression . The investigator plan examine network change brain stimulate `` Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation '' ( TMS ) . TMS way stimulate brain order mildly activate mildly suppress different brain area , use treat form depression . It hop study facilitate learning structure function different brain area way interconnect form network , depressed people people without depression . In research study , effect TMS measure obtain `` picture '' brain `` Magnetic Resonance Imaging '' ( MRI ) `` Positron Emission Tomography '' ( PET ) . More specifically , accomplish combined MRI PET scanner , capable simultaneously obtain MRI PET image brain . This scan paradigm allow assessment local metabolic change result TMS ( PET image ) brain network change result TMS ( fMRI ) . Changes result TMS 20 subject depression 20 healthy volunteer calculate form main outcome measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , deliver dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) clinically effective treatment major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Network model MDD increasingly gain acceptance , functional connectivity MRI ( fcMRI ) reveal topographically specific aberration functional network architecture MDD . And yet , despite hint therapeutic effect rTMS actuate distributed impact upon cortical subcortical limbic center , network effect rTMS remain mysterious . This study seek investigate way rTMS DLPFC modulate network functional connectivity site stimulation critical limbic region , subgenual cingulate ( sgACC ) , sgACC limbic region . In study , high frequency rTMS use stimulate leave DLPFC ( recapitulate therapeutic methodology ) , specifically , region DLPFC functionally correlate anti-correlated sgACC . This accomplished group patient MDD , group carefully match control . These subject scan rTMS deliver , way gauge effect . The feasibility design recently demonstrate group ( Eldaief et al . PNAS 2011 ) . Changes induce stimulation chart novel combine MRI-PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scanner MGH Martinos Center , capable simultaneously record fcMRI BOLD ( Blood oxygenation level-dependent ) 18Flurodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) PET data . This permit cortico-limbic network characterize dynamically ( 1 ) examination differential effect stimulate two network DLPFC , ( 2 ) track dynamic interplay rTMS induce change local glucose metabolism DLPFC sgACC one hand , change distribute connectivity region . In exploratory aim , MDD patient return three month later ( undergone non-specific treatment intervention psychiatric provider ) identical rTMS/fcMRI/FDG-PET procedure . This aim establish , proof principle , treatment MDD associate change cortico-limbic functional network architecture , cortico-limbic dynamic . Eventually , hop work lead emergence aberrant cortical dynamic biomarker MDD . In addition , work might pollinate future study use aberrant cortical dynamic novel therapeutic target upon neuromodulatory intervention might intervene .</detailed_description>
