	<detailed_description>Pain `` unpleasant sensory emotional experience associate actual potential tissue damage '' . Evaluation pain neonate difficult due subjective nature pain inability neonates verbally express pain . Surrogate measure use describe pain neonate include motor response , facial expression , cry change physiologic parameter like heart rate , blood pressure , oxygen saturation respiratory rate . Various change compile create various score . Validated score assessment pain include Neonatal Facial Coding System , Neonatal Infant Pain Scale Premature Infant Pain Profile . These reaction pain may contribute development hypoxia , hypercarbia , acidosis , ventilator asynchrony , pneumothoraces , reperfusion injury venous congestion subsequent late intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) late extension early intraventricular hemorrhage periventricular leukomalacia . These behavioral change may also disrupt postnatal adaptation , parent-infant bond feeding schedule . Newborn infant routinely undergo painful invasive procedure , even uncomplicated birth . Evidence show neonate feel pain may even increase sensitivity pain long term effect compare old infant . Treating procedural pain become crucial part neonatal care . In healthy infant , common painful procedure heel lance venipuncture . Though minimally invasive , lance painful procedure activate cortical area brain .Repetitive procedural pain lead change pain sensitivity threshold therefore , adequate analgesic control need . Pharmacological treatment rarely use procedure concern effectiveness ( topical local anesthetic paracetamol heel prick ) potential adverse effect ( central analgesic ) . Therefore , non-pharmacological intervention valuable alternative . Recent intervention sweet oral solution ( sucrose glucose ) non-nutritive sucking use frequently alleviate pain . Use sucrose preterm neonate advocate uniformly pain relief . However , recently report raise concern safety effect neurodevelopment . Glucose use pain relief neonates therapeutic efficacy comparison oral sucrose direct adequately power RCT pain assessment tool evaluate Indian subcontinent . The present study plan evaluate efficacy 25 % glucose solution 24 % sucrose solution analgesia heel lance preterm neonate . LACUNAE IN EXISTING KNOWLEDGE Existing literature efficacy glucose vs. sucrose inconclusive superiority either . When Medline search carry return limited result result return Indian subcontinent compare two solution use multidimensional pain assessment tool . There need efficacious cheap substitute readily available NICU setting sterile . Hence , role 25 % Glucose neonatal pain relief safety associate use need evaluate .</detailed_description>
