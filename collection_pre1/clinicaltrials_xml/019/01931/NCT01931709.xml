	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE ) -magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) predict response treatment patient breast cancer . Comparing result diagnostic procedure do , , chemotherapy may help doctor predict patient 's response treatment help plan best treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FDG PET DCE-MRI Predicting Response Treatment Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether detailed kinetic analysis FDG PET magnetic resonance ( MR ) image study measure tumor metabolism blood perfusion predict response outcome breast cancer patient undergo neo-adjuvant therapy . II . To compare vivo tumor biology associate responsive resistant tumor measure kinetic change FDG PET MR image parameter tumor subtypes analyze assay pre-therapy biopsy post-therapy surgical tissue . OUTLINE : Patients undergo FDG PET DCE-MRI 1-2 week prior chemotherapy initiation , 1-12 week initiation first course chemotherapy , completion chemotherapy ( within 4 week prior surgery ) .</detailed_description>
