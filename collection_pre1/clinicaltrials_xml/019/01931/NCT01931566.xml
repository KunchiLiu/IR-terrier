	<brief_title>Biomarker Qualification Risk Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) Due Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) Safety Efficacy Evaluation Pioglitazone Delaying Its Onset</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study two goal . One goal see new genetic test determine participant risk develop Mild Cognitive Impairment due Alzheimer 's Disease ( MCI-AD ) within next five year . The goal evaluate study drug call pioglitazone . Pioglitazone test delay onset MCI-AD . This study look effectiveness pioglitazone delay onset MCI-AD cognitively-normal people high-risk develop MCI-AD , idenfitied biomarker non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasian participant . In addition , approximately 300 cognitively normal elderly participant participate volumetric magnetic resonance imaging ( vMRI ) substudy select site . In vMRI substudy , high-risk participant randomize ( 5:4 ) receive either pioglitazone placebo . This multi-centre trial conduct worldwide . The study enroll approximately 3500 subject . Participants assign high low risk group develop MCI- AD within next five year , base result biomarker risk algorithm . Participants high risk group randomly assign one two treatment groups—which remain unknown participant study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Pioglitazone tablet - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet look like study drug active ingredient . Participants low risk group assign placebo . The assignment participant high low risk group , well participant 's treatment assignment , remain undisclosed participant study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) . All participant ask take one tablet time day throughout study . The overall time participate study approximately 5 year . Participants make 14 visit clinic , contact telephone 3 month treatment visit follow-up assessment , 2 week final visit .</detailed_description>
