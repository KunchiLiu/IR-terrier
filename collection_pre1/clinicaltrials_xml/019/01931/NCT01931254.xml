	<brief_summary>In past 70 year antibiotic serve first line defense infectious disease . However , antibiotic effective bacterial infection solution infection cause virus common cold flu . Despite contribution healthcare , antibiotic currently recognize misuse drug world global overuse estimate 40 % -70 % , mostly due ineffectiveness current diagnostic solution distinguish bacterial viral infection . Antibiotics misuse often cause preventable adverse event impact patient care lead emergence antibiotic-resistant bacteria , one major threat global health today . To address challenge , MeMed develop ImmunoDx™ , novel technology relies best available detection system differentiate virus bacteria - body 's immune system . The ImmunoDx™ technology employ simple blood test provide physician , within two-hours , information need decide whether treat patient antibiotic . This technology test 1000 patient different age disease find highly accurate safe . The current study non-interventional study participant receive investigational drug experimental examination procedure . Therefore , collect data study affect diagnosis , prognosis , treatment participant . Participation include collection teaspoon blood collection specimen use nasal swab . These procedure common clinical practice widely perform possess significant risk . By participate study , subject impact development ImmunoDx™ technology , expect enable future faster accurate diagnosis infectious disease well appropriate prescription antibiotic . This open way improve treatment decision million patient around world .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective clinical validation study novel in-vitro diagnostic ( IVD ) assay enroll 830 pediatric patient . The study conduct two stage : In stage A 50 patient enrol aim verify proper protocol execution include proper collection patient sample , accurate data retrieval precise etiology determination . In stage B 780 patient enrol aim blind validation host-response base diagnostics use fresh independent cohort patient . Patients enrol study manage accord current standard care ( GCP ) per standard institutional procedure . Participation study require collection additional blood sample nasal swab sampling . The investigated assay require measurement three host-related , blood-based , protein biomarkers integrate use logistic regression formula single score . Based score , patient classify one three category : ( ) bacterial immune response ( i.e. , pure bacterial infection mixed bacterial viral co-infection ) , ( ii ) viral immune response , ( iii ) marginal immune response ( inconclusive non-infectious ) . It estimate 10-20 % infected patient marginal immune response . A composite reference standard use order determine diagnosis patient . Specifically , clinical , radiological , microbiological laboratory data patient , record dedicate eCRF . Based data , diagnosis patient determine panel three independent pediatrician . Each pediatrician blind diagnosis peer assay result . In current study , unanimous agreement expert ( `` consensus agreement '' ) consider true diagnosis purpose compute assay performance .</detailed_description>
