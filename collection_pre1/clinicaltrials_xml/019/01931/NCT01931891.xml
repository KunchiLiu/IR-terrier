	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia multi-systemic disorder . Despite seriousness , aetyology remain unknown . Current theory include abnormal placentation , cardiovascular maladaptation pregnancy , genetic immune mechanism , angiogenic factor enhance systemic inflammatory response . Poor placental perfusion lead wide spread maternal endothelial dysfunction accept major mechanism . The trophoblastic invasion maternal vessel result many change extracellular matrix , give rise high uteroplacental vessel distensibility accommodate increase blood flow . So , İn normal pregnancy , wide spread vasodilatation , increase arterial compliance reduce peripheral vascular resistance.In preeclampsia , however , trophoblastic invasion reduce , lead incomplete modification maternal spiral artery therefore decrease placental perfusion . Pre-eclampsia accompany extensive remodelling ECM umbilical cord placenta . Pre-eclamptic Wharton 's jelly contain high amount glycosaminoglycans comparison control tissue . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) family proteolytic enzyme degrade various component extracellularmatrix ( ECM ) . These enzyme play essential role physiological state tissue remodel , morphogenesis wound heal anda lso pathological process tumor cell invasion metastasis . A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinases ( ADAMs ) ADAMs Thrombospondin motif ( ADAMTS ) proteinases closely related Matrix Metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . Dysregulation ADAMsexpression beenreported differenttypes pathology cancer , osteoarthritis , neurodegenerative inflammation asthma . Some author suggestted ADAM-8 , -9 , -10 , -12 , -15 , -17 , ADAMTS-1 might play role uterus remodel periimplantation period ADAMTS-12 , independent proteolytic activity , play critical role human trophoblastic cell invasion vitro . Human umbilical cord extra-embryonic structure link mother fetus pregnancy In umbilical cord two artery one vein surround collagen-rich , myxomatous substance , call Wharton 's jelly ( WJ ) protect umbilical vessel extension , bending , twist compression . The extracellular matrix ( ECM ) WJ copious contains significant amount hyaluronic acid sulphated glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) . İts interest Wharton 's jelly contain low number cell large amount collagen GAGs . Wharton 's jelly play also important role storage compound , growth factor . Previous study demonstrate human umbilical cord serum tissue contain large amount IGF-I IGF-binding protein ( BPs ) , mainly BP-1 BP-3 . Structural alteration human umbilical cord cause adverse fetal consequence . ECM dynamic result change ECM composition , example , alter synthesis degradation one ECM component , architecture alter organization . Pre-eclampsia accompany extensive remodelling ECM umbilical cord . İt find significant increase collagen content umbilical cord artery vein premature replacement hyaluronic acid sulfate GAGs UCAs Wharton 's jelly preeclampsia . Pre-eclamptic Wharton 's jelly contain high amount glycosaminoglycans comparison control tissue . The role ADAMTS pathology pre-eclampsia study . We therefore decide compare ADAMTS composition umbilical cord placenta newborns mother pre-eclampsia normal pregnancy .</detailed_description>
