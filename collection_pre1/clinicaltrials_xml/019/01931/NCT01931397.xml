	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation treatment choice kidney failure child . Kidney transplant recipient need take immunosuppression rest live transplantation prevent rejection graft . One important medication call Tacrolimus prevent rejection kidney graft time toxic kidney . Therefore , repeat blood level Tacrolimus test kidney function help physician prescribe best dose therapy prevent kidney rejection kidney toxicity . Failure compliance take Tacrolimus also important cause graft failure especially among teenager , repeat blood Tacrolimus level necessary detect patient fail take medication regular basis . We develop lab assay measure Tacrolimus blood level creatinine ( kidney function ) use one dried blood spot ( DBS ) filter paper similar filter paper use new born screen . We plan teach patient test home month mail filter paper back OHSU analysis Tacrolimus creatinine . The advantage method less painful child regular blood dray vein , do easily home , cost effective save family day work school detect Tacrolimus level kidney function time . We assess effect simple finger prick home compliance , Tacrolimus level kidney function study period one year . We also assess satisfied patient method instead go lab hospital blood test . All subject continue regular clinic visit continue routine blood draw intravenous method lab study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DBS Home Monitoring Children With Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To validate DBS method home monitoring device use home parent patient 30 pediatric kidney transplant recipient . We validate TAC creatinine ( Cr ) blood level obtain DBS method comparison blood TAC serum creatinine level use standard laboratory assay CLIA approve clinical laboratory . Specific Aim 2 : The use DBS filter paper associate good adherence monthly blood test medication intake . This aim test assess number DBS filter paper return OHSU every month . Adherence medication intake assess measure variability TAC trough level , individual reporting . We calculate percent return DBS filter paper OHSU monthly basis well percent collect properly home successfully utilized TAC Cr analysis . Specific Aim 3 : This aim explore patient family satisfaction self management use DBS method vs. standard method schedule clinic laboratory visit . Design : This pilot study evaluate validate novel use DBS filter paper home monitoring method . This study involve within-subjects , repeat measure design test specific hypothesis . Participants : The pediatric kidney transplant program Doernbecher Children 's Hospital/OHSU follow approximately 120 active renal transplant recipient 2-21 year . Thirty patient gender participate study follow one year . Inclusion criterion : 1 . On Tacrolimus immunosuppression therapy 2 . At least six month post kidney transplantation</detailed_description>
