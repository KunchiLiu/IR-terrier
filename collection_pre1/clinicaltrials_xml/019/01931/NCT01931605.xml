	<brief_summary>Background : Patients indwell urinary catheter chronic retention due obstructive BPH refractory medical therapy candidate prostatectomy still consider gold standard treatment . Urinary tract infection , stricture , postoperative pain , incontinence , sexual dysfunction , anesthesiologist risk blood loss complication associate surgery . Minimally invasive treatment originally conceive attempt offer equivalent efficacy without burden risk operative morbidity . Recently , suggest prostatic arterial embolization ( PAE ) treat BPH might follow uterine artery embolization uterine leiomyoma . Animal study pig dog show PAE safe induce prostatic volume reduction . The first report technique management BPH humans DeMeritt et al , report single case BPH obstructive symptom blood loss refractory treatment successfully manage PAE polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) particle . Objective : We investigate whether PAE might feasible procedure alternative treatment option treat urinary retention due obstructive BPH . The primary objective evaluate success rate procedure define selective prostatic arterial catheterization embolization achieve patient able urinate urinary catheter remove . Patients method : A monocentric prospective study undertaken 25 patient age 50-85 year present indwell urinary catheter due obstructive BPH refractory medical treatment clinical indication surgery agree undergo PAE . The study approve hospital ethical committee inform consent form PAE alternative treatment sign participant . Statistical analysis : The sample size calculate order estimate probability success ( correspond primary objective ) 50 % ( bad case ) 95 % confidence interval 30 70 . The two-sample t-test ( Wilcoxon rank-sum test ) use compare mean change variable baseline 10 , 30 90 day . Finally , Chi-square test use test adverse event end follow-up . P ≤ 0.05 indicative statistically significant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Results Selective Prostatic Arterial Embolization Patients With Indwelling Urinary Catheter Due Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Refractory Medical Treatment .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Embolization perform local anesthesia one day surgery unit unilateral approach , usually right femoral artery . Initially , pelvic angiography perform evaluate iliac prostatic artery . Then , 5-F catheter introduce right femoral artery catheterize leave hypogastric artery reach anterior division . The inferior vesical artery finally prostatic vessel selectively catheterize 3-F coaxial microcatheter . For embolization , nonspherical 100-300 μm PVA particle use . The endpoint choose embolization slow flow near-stasis prostatic vessel interruption arterial flow prostatic gland opacification . When embolization leave prostatic artery finish , right prostatic artery embolized way . Urinary catheter remove 10 day embolization procedure . Voiding trial perform successfull urination urethral catheter removal define three consecutive spontaneous micturition postvoid residual less 100 % micturition volume . If patient unable urinate , urethral catheter replace hospitalization discharge patient return outpatient clinic another void trial end protocol . Assessments carry 10 , 30 90 day initial embolization allocation .</detailed_description>

Prostate cancer ( evaluate PSA , physical examination , patient prostatic biopsy suspicious case ) . History relevant neurological disease ( e.g . multiple sclerosis , spinal cord injury , parkinson 's disease ) . Patients urodynamic investigation evidence atonic bladder . Urethral stricture Chronic persistent local pathology may cause urinary symptom ( e.g . interstitial cystitis , tumor , bladder stone ) . Renal insufficiency stade 3 4 ( creatinine clearance &lt; 35 mL/min ) Any allergy contraindication ciprofloxacin drug use protocole ( xylocaine , Atarax , paracetamol , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ) Any allergy intravenous contrast agent iodine Thyrotoxicosis Concomitant use tizanidine Patients participate another research protocol</criteria>
