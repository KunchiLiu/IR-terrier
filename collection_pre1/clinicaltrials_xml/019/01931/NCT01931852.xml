	<detailed_description>In evaluation patient possible acute coronary syndrome , serum troponin measurement critical determinant myocardial necrosis . The recent implementation high-sensitivity troponin assay allow detection low level serum troponin possible less sensitive predecessor . As result , 30 % patient diagnose myocardial injury optimal management patient unclear . Guidelines American Heart Association American College Cardiology recommend invasive management strategy ( Class 1a ) acknowledge data support invasive strategy base less sensitive troponin assay available today . Clinical trial invasive strategy patient detectable minimally elevate troponin value demonstrate conflict result . Observational data suggest aggressive medical therapy rather increase use revascularization drive improve outcomes patient . Meanwhile , patient minimally elevate serum troponin value experience near double rate invasive angiography . In short , uncertain whether patient detectable minimally elevate troponin result benefit current invasive-based care strategy . As alternative , cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) image highly accurate detect significant coronary disease need coronary revascularization . Objectives : The broad , long-term objective improve outcome optimize healthcare delivery process patient detectable elevated serum troponin . To achieve goal , propose clinical trial ( n=312 ) involve emergency department patient intermediate high-risk chest pain detectable minimally elevate serum troponin within 6 hour evaluation . Methods : Participants randomize one two care strategy : ) invasive-based guideline-adherent strategy , b ) CMR-guided . Outcomes assess average 2.3 year . The specific aim proposal 1 ) Test whether CMR-guided strategy ( versus invasive-based guideline-adherent strategy ) reduce composite death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , cardiac-related hospital readmission study duration , 2 ) Test whether CMR-guided strategy ( versus invasive-based guideline-adherent strategy ) reduce invasive angiography , coronary revascularization , recurrent cardiac testing , cardiac-related emergency department visit .</detailed_description>
