Infection dengue virus lead cause hospitalization death child least 8 tropical Asian country . There 4 type dengue virus ( DENV-1 , DENV-2 , DENV-3 , DENV-4 ) , cause dengue illness range mild illness life-threatening disease . This study evaluate experimental rDEN2Î”30-7169 vaccine prevention illness due DENV-2 . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity vaccine healthy adult history previous flavivirus infection . At study entry , participant randomly assign receive either dengue virus vaccine placebo . They remain clinic 30 minute receive injection monitoring .

Confirmation obtain repeat test ensure abnormal value due aberrancy . Any condition opinion investigator would jeopardize safety right participant trial would render participant unable comply protocol Any significant alcohol drug abuse past 12 month cause medical , occupational , family problem , indicate participant history History severe allergic reaction anaphylaxis Severe asthma ( emergency room visit hospitalization within last 6 month ) HIV infection , screen confirmatory assay Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , screen confirmatory assay Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) screen Any known immunodeficiency syndrome Use anticoagulant medication Use corticosteroid ( exclude topical nasal ) immunosuppressive drug within 28 day prior follow vaccination . Immunosuppressive dose corticosteroid define great equal 10 mg prednisone equivalent per day great equal 14 day . Receipt live vaccine within 28 day kill vaccine within 14 day prior vaccination anticipate receipt vaccine 28 day follow vaccination Asplenia Receipt blood product within past 6 month , include transfusion immunoglobulin anticipate receipt blood product immunoglobulin 28 day follow vaccination History serologic evidence previous dengue virus infection flavivirus infection ( e.g. , yellow fever virus , St. Louis encephalitis virus , West Nile virus ) Previous receipt flavivirus vaccine ( licensed experimental ) Anticipated receipt investigational agent 28 day vaccination Has definite plan travel dengue endemic area study Refusal allow storage specimens future research Other Treatments Ongoing The following criterion review Days 28 56 follow vaccination . If become applicable study , participant include immunogenicity evaluation , exclusionary visit . The participant , however , encourage remain study safety evaluation duration study . Ongoing Use investigational drug investigational vaccine study vaccine 28day period post vaccination Chronic administration ( great equal 14 day ) steroid ( define prednisone equivalent great equal 10 mg per day ) , immunosuppressant , immunemodifying drug initiate 28day period post vaccination ( topical nasal steroid allow ) Receipt license vaccine 28day period post vaccination Receipt immunoglobulins and/or blood product 28day period post vaccination Pregnancy</criteria>
