	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe dose-limiting toxicity , maximally tolerate dose , identify recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) combination BKM120 ( buparlisib ) , gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) , cisplatin patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe safety tolerability combination BKM120 , gemcitabine , cisplatin patient advance solid tumor . II . To describe preliminary evidence efficacy combination . III . To describe pharmacokinetic ( PK ) effect gemcitabine cisplatin plasma concentration BKM120 . IV . To evaluate phosphatidylinositol-4 , 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) mutation predictive biomarkers efficacy combination . V. To evaluate PIK3CA polymorphisms polymorphism BKM120 transport metabolism predictor toxicity and/or efficacy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive buparlisib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 , cisplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
