	<brief_title>Early Serum Infliximab Levels Severe Ulcerative Colitis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Gastroenterology Association ( AGA ) recommend infliximab , chimeric monoclonal antibody human tumor necrosis factor ( anti-TNF ) , treatment patient ulcerative colitis ( UC ) n't achieve adequate clinical response despite treatment conventional therapy . Infliximab FDA approve therapy ulcerative colitis base two large randomize trial , ACT I ACT II . For patient respond induction therapy , schedule maintenance therapy demonstrate durable safe . However , trial include hospitalized patient . Severe flare , fulminant ulcerative colitis , remain highly morbid potentially fatal presentation disease . Traditionally , hospitalize patient fail high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy require life-saving colectomy . Although advent infliximab present alternative rescue therapy , patient severe ulcerative colitis non-responders anti-TNF induction therapy proceed colectomy . In ACT I II trial , outpatient moderate severe ulcerative colitis randomize placebo , 5mg/kg infliximab therapy , 10mg/kg infliximab therapy . At 54 week follow-up , patient receive infliximab 41 % reduce risk colectomy compare placebo group . Although infliximab 5mg/kg associate reduce risk colectomy , 10mg/kg infliximab dose yield statistically significant risk reduction . There differences safety 5mg/kg 10mg/kg infliximab group ; similar rate serious adverse event , infection , infusion reaction report . Thus , institution ( University California San Francisco ) , standard care administer infliximab 10mg/kg IV patient hospitalize severe ulcerative colitis . Dose escalation 5mg/kg 10mg/kg routinely prescribed recapture clinical response subset patient inflammatory bowel disease experience loss response maintenance therapy support FDA label Crohn 's disease . Loss response infliximab maintenance therapy well-recognized phenomenon , abundant literature suggest durable efficacious infliximab therapy dependent upon optimize serum infliximab level . Specifically , high serum infliximab trough level predict clinical response , low serum trough level presence infliximab antibody associate loss response . However , serum infliximab level dependent upon drug dose pharmacokinetics alone . Concurrent immunomodulator use may reduce immunogenicity monoclonal antibody therapy , recently , increase recognition importance patient factor well . Specifically , variability drug metabolism clearance associate body-mass index , sex , severity inflammation - measure C-reactive protein , serum albumin , tumor necrosis factor alpha level . It demonstrate patient higher serum albumin level maintain high infliximab concentration , low clearance , long drug half-lives patient low serum albumin level ; low serum albumin correlate poor clinical response . Severe colonic disease associate high early fecal infliximab concentration , inversely associate serum infliximab level response therapy . Moreover , high serum tumor necrosis factor alpha level prior infliximab infusion predict poor clinical outcome need dose escalation patient Crohn 's disease rheumatoid arthritis . Patients hospitalize severe ulcerative colitis least afford suboptimal infliximab therapy , high risk give malnutrition uncontrolled inflammation . There grow trend towards use high dose infliximab first line therapy severe , hospitalize patient one infusion ( dose ) demonstrate clinical response refer colectomy . However , currently pharmacokinetic data support practice . There small body literature serum infliximab trough level may predict clinical outcome acute ulcerative colitis . To knowledge , study regard use early infliximab level - within first 72 hour - predict clinical response vulnerable subset patient hospitalize severe ulcerative colitis . We propose pilot study investigate treatment severe ulcerative colitis high-dose infliximab ( 10mg/kg infusion ) , standard care UCSF severe , hospitalize ulcerative colitis . This prospective , multi-site study consecutively enroll hospitalize ulcerative colitis patient meet inclusion criterion anyone four UCSF-affiliated hospital . Per routine care , enrol subject undergo infectious work-up , receive intravenous corticosteroid addition supportive care , undergo evaluation Colorectal Surgeon . Subjects eligible anti-TNF therapy routine screen begin infliximab induction therapy hospital day 3 10mg/kg . We perform standardized pre- post-treatment assessment disease activity ( Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index - UCDAI ) , include acquisition biochemical endoscopic data . We measure serum level tumor necrosis factor alpha , infliximab , infliximab antibody throughout course treatment . The primary outcome avoidance colectomy . This study first knowledge examine empiric use high-dose infliximab combine early therapeutic drug monitoring guide care patient hospitalize severe ulcerative colitis . Our ultimate goal develop rational approach maximize infliximab therapy set severe ulcerative colitis minimize predict primary non-response infliximab induction therapy . Aside draw infliximab tumor necrosis factor alpha level , procedures treatment provide patient part routine care patient severe ulcerative colitis . Routine care patient hospitalize severe ulcerative colitis summarize follow protocol : On hospital day 1-2 , hospitalize patient severe ulcerative colitis undergo diagnostic evaluation include bloodwork ( complete blood count , C-reactive protein , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , serum albumin ) , infectious work-up ( Clostridium difficile , stool culture , stool ovum parasite , cytomegalovirus ) , standardized assessment disease activity ( flexible sigmoidoscopy calculation UCDAI score ) . Patients start corticosteroid therapy ( Solumedrol 40mg intravenous daily ) , screen eligibility anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy ( hepatitis B surface antibody , hepatitis B core antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen , tuberculin skin test , Quantiferon gold test , chest radiograph ) . The Quantiferon gold test order inpatient . Intravenous antibiotic give therapeutically event document infection clinical toxicity , prophylactically administer . Subcutaneous heparin administer deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis per standard care . On hospital day 3 , positive negative response intravenous corticosteroid determine prior initiation high-dose infliximab . Responders medical therapy continue infliximab induction regimen ( week 0 , 2 , 6 infusion ) . After complete induction regimen , patient undergo repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy calculation UCDAI score week 8 . Eligible study subject receive first induction dose infliximab ( 10mg/kg intravenous infusion ) hospital day 3 . A pre-infusion tumor necrosis factor alpha level immediate post-infusion serum infliximab check . On hospital day 4 , serum tumor necrosis factor alpha 24 hour serum infliximab level measure . On hospital day 5 , serum tumor necrosis factor alpha 48 hour serum infliximab level measure . On hospital day 6 , serum tumor necrosis factor alpha 72 hour serum infliximab level measure . One week initial infusion , serum tumor necrosis factor alpha serum infliximab level measure . Two week initial infusion , serum tumor necrosis factor alpha serum infliximab level measure .</detailed_description>
