	<brief_summary>Premenopausal Women age 18-42 undergo laparoscopic myomectomy . Prior myomectomy , adhesion assess use modify AFS score technique . All investigator provide usual customary care research subject first look laparoscopy . This include use standard practice anti-adhesive agent heparinized irrigation fluids.V-Loc 180 suture utilized patient . All patient evaluate mean second look laparoscopy ( SLL ) 6-12 week initial surgery reevaluate via modified American Fertility Society score technique . An independent reviewer also score adhesion utilize video record make second look laparoscopic surgery . Patients contact 1 4 week post -op assess complication . It expectation patient show great post-operative adhesion formation &lt; 1 % complication rate . Time ease suture also evaluate . It expect V-Loc suture technique show significantly reduce suturing time , easy use , associate minimal adhesion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This post-market , control , single-center study evaluate V-Loc suture . 10 subject include study . Premenopausal woman age 18-42 undergo laparoscopic myomectomy . Adhesion score do prior myomectomy use modified American Fertility Society score technique . V-loc 180 suture utilized patient closure uterine defect . All patient evaluate mean second look laparoscopy ( SLL ) 6-12 week initial surgery evaluate via modified American Fertility Society score technique . An independent reviewer also score adhesion utilize video recording make second look laparoscopic surgery , use score technique employ PI.. Patients undergo routine preoperative blood test accordance Primary Investigators ' usual standard practice . All patient meet inclusion criterion consider . Patients consent prior entry operate room . Surgical time measure start procedure , start myomectomy , start finish time individual uterine closure . All investigator provide usual customary care research subject first look laparoscopy . This include use standard practice anti-adhesive agent heparinized irrigation fluid . Physicians survey ease use problem occur V-Loc suture . All patient treat post-operative antibiotic per Primary Investigator 's usual standard care . Patients contact one 4 week post surgery evaluate complication use phone survey pain bowel functioning . The patient also standard post operative exam physician 4-6 week post-operatively . A second look laparoscopy perform 6-12 week follow initial myomectomy . Adhesions evaluate use modified American Fertility Society evaluation tool . Any adhesion see time SLL treat use physician 's preferred method adhesiolysis . A recording obtain second look laparoscopy review scored independent reviewer level adhesion see .</detailed_description>
