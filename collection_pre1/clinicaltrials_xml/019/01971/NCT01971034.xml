	<brief_summary>In Brazil pancreatic adenocarcinoma represent 2 % tumor , 4 % mortality uncommon disease , however aggressive.Only 20 % case indicate curative surgery , 20 % alive within 5 year . For locally , advance metastatic disease , since 1997 , single chemotherapy gemcitabine standard treatment first line , survival around 6 month approximately.There standard treatment regimen second-line , however Paclitaxel demonstrate effect second-line phase II study . Metformin oral hypoglycemic drug use treatment diabetes mellitus . There grow number preclinical study show antitumor effect pancreatic adenocarcinoma , probably due effect anti-insulin growth factor ( IGF-1 ) . This study add metformin standard treatment second line locally advance metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma ICESP previously treat gemcitabine . The objective evaluate whether metformin improve efficacy standard treatment paclitaxel clinical radiological evaluation .</brief_summary>
