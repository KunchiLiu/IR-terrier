	<detailed_description>The prevalence overweight Spanish child puberty age among high world increase quickly . Our group do far two intervention base after-school program recreational physical activity control obesity cardiovascular risk factor primary school child ( 8-to-11 year ) Cuenca , Spain . The first edition , call MOVI , show moderate effect reduce adiposity improve lipid profile , significantly improve overall cardiometabolic risk , mainly reduce blood insulin level . A second edition ( MOVI-2 ) , increased duration intensity session focus increased muscle strength . Preliminary analysis also show decrease body fat , reduction global cardiometabolic decrease insulin level . Our project integrate multidimensional intervention promote physical activity , mixed design ( cross-over randomize trial , qualitative study ) consist two sub-projects share study population : `` Effectiveness intervention physical activity promotion schoolchildren prevent obesity adiposity rebound period : cross-over randomized cluster trial '' `` Effectiveness physical activity intervention prevent obesity improve academic performance child without ADHD risk '' . The two intervention base cross-over randomized trial aim test effectiveness intervention promote physical activity school environment ( MOVI-KIDS ) two-years 22 school ( 20 public two private school ) province Cuenca Ciudad Real , Spain .
