	<detailed_description>The number diagnose renal cell carcinoma increase past two decade incidental detection small renal tumour result increase use compute tomography [ 1,2 ] . There distinct subtypes renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , biological aggressiveness prognosis subtypes document . Clear-cell RCC common RCC subtype , follow papillary RCC , chromophobe RCC unclassified RCC . Collecting duct carcinoma rare highly malignant type RCC . Although enhance renal mass adult RCC , significant percentage benign ( commonly oncocytoma ) , benign tumour distinguish malignant tumour base standard image technology alone . Benign primary renal mass include simple renal cyst , psuedotumours , angiomyolipomas , oncocytomas , juxtaglomerular tumour , multilocular cystic nephromas , mesoblastic nephromas papillary adenoma . In recent surgical series 228 patient underwent partial radical nephrectomy lesion ≤4 cm , 26.3 % benign [ 3 ] . The relatively high percentage patient benign renal cortical neoplasm undergo surgery highlight importance new diagnostic technology avoid over-treatment . Ultrasound ( US ) CT scan guide biopsy commonly use method diagnosis RCC . The sensitivity biopsy small mass ( ≤3 cm ) low large mass [ 4 ] . Sensitivity limit false-negative result , due failure properly target small mass presence impossible-to-differentiate benign malignant cell due insufficient cell , morphological overlap cellular heterogeneity . Non diagnostic biopsy necessary benign , repeat biopsy reveals malignancy diagnosis majority [ 5 ] . There radiologic criterion consistent oncocytoma lack sensitivity specificity [ 6 ] . MR-scanning CT-scanning feasible diagnostic methodology oncocytoma possibility overlap result oncocytoma RCC [ 7 ] . Hypotheses : To investigate ability perfusion CT/US-scanning facilitate recognition different tumour sub-types small renal mass le 7 cm non-invasive imagining technology . Purpose : To recognize different subtype 's renal tumor non invasive scanning . Design : A descriptive study</detailed_description>
