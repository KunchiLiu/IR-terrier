	<detailed_description>A deficit cognitive suppression trait patient schizophrenia . Cognitive suppression ability control suppress irrelevant information adopt relevant response instead . This ability basic skill essential maintain normal well-adjusted life . We need suppress distract information order focus attention , suppress irrelevant cue order retrieve particular memory , suppress habitual response order make adaptive choice ( Dillon &amp; Pizzagalli , 2007 ) . The purpose study investigate effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) information suppression schizophrenic patient . This noninvasive technique brain stimulation induces prolong functional change cerebral cortex application weak direct current scalp ( Nitsche &amp; Paulus , 2001 ; Nitsche et al. , 2003 , 2004 ; Antal et al. , 2004 ) . The aim study test whether anodal cathodal tDCS differentially modify performance several cognitive task apply left/right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) . Sixty patient divide four group : 1 ) 15 schizophrenic subject tDCS treatment group ; 2 ) 15 schizophrenic subject sham tDCS group ; 3 ) 15 healthy subject tDCS treatment group ; 4 ) 15 healthy subject sham tDCS group . All participant complete baseline test include n-back test , Hayling test metaphoric comprehension test . The schizophrenic subject , complete bank cognitive test baseline ( MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery ( MCCB ) . The first meeting schizophrenic subject use determine best stimulation area ( right/left DLPFC ) type ( anodal/ cathodal ) . Schizophrenic subject treatment control group undergo six treatment session total . The cognitive test give participant end study . In order evaluate improvement pre-test post-test , difference reaction time error rate calculate participant . This study important reason . First , study focus difficulty suppress irrelevant information , executive function ability essential lead normal life . Special population , specifically people schizophrenia , difficulty suppress irrelevant information , correlation note characteristic weak executive functioning capability . In study evaluate potential minimizing difficulty use tDCS . This particular tool choose study easy use , non-invasive , painless . Research show tDCS stimulation DLPFC improve performance cognitive task , result mirror use medication . Second , recognition heterogeneity schizophrenic patient ( substantiate fact success treatment vary patient patient ) , study perform test identify preferred stimulation region , DLPFC left/right . The result help determine specifically degree heterogeneity term region responsible suppress irrelevant information . Related , able assess impact stimulation , include whether stimulation benefit schizophrenic patient , alternatively , unknown variable involve determine relative success treatment amongst individual . In addition , able explore difference correlation healthy subject ' verbal ability relation various test conduct , assess impact test healthy subject ' cognitive inhibition work memory . Finally , study critical treatment method prove successful , would able extend study population difficulty executive functioning , addition , examine effect electrical stimulation cognitive ability .</detailed_description>
