	<brief_title>Safety Feasibility Effect TTFields ( 150 kHz ) Concomitant With Gemcitabine Concomitant With Gemcitabine Plus Nab-paclitaxel Front-line Therapy Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma ( PANOVA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAST PRE CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE : The effect electric field generate NovoTTF-100L device ( TTFields , TTF ) demonstrate significant activity vitro vivo pancreatic adenocarcinoma pre-clinical model single modality treatment , combination gemcitabine combination paclitaxel . TTFields therapy also show inhibit metastatic spread malignant melanoma vivo experiment . In small scale pilot study , patient stage IIIB- IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) tumor progression least one line prior chemotherapy receive Pemetrexed together TTFields apply chest upper abdomen disease progression . Efficacy endpoints remarkably high compare historical data Pemetrexed alone . In large prospective , randomized trial , recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) . The outcome subject treat TTFields compare treat effective best standard care chemotherapy ( include bevacizumab ) . TTFields treat subject comparable overall survival subject receive best available chemotherapy US today . Similar result show comparability TTFields best standard care ( BSC ) chemotherapy see secondary endpoint . Recurrent GBM patient treat TTFields trial experience few side effect general , significantly few treatment related side effect , significantly low gastrointestinal , hematological infectious adverse event compare control . The device-related adverse event see mild moderate skin irritation beneath device electrode . Finally , quality life measure well TTFields treated subject group compare subject receive effective best standard care chemotherapy . In large prospective , randomized trial , newly diagnose GBM , TTFields combination standard-of-care temozolomide chemotherapy extend progression-free survival overall survival compare temozolomide alone . There significant increase serious adverse event TTFields combination temozolomide versus temozolomide alone . The common adverse reaction TTFields treatment mild moderate skin irritation . DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL : All patient include trial diagnose unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma . In addition , patient must meet eligibility criterion . Eligible patient enrol , baseline test perform patient treat continuously device concomitant gemcitabine concomitant gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel disease progression . TTFields treatment consist wear four electrically insulated electrode array torso . Electrode array placement require shave abdomen/back necessary treatment . After initial short visit clinic training monitoring , patient release continue treatment home maintain regular daily routine . During trial , patient need return every 4 week clinic examination physician routine laboratory examination do . These routine visit continue long patient 's disease progressing . During monthly follow visit clinic patient examine physically . Additionally , routine blood test perform . A routine CT chest abdomen perform baseline every 8 week thereafter , disease progression . After follow plan , patient contact per month telephone answer basic question health status . SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : Electric field exert force electric charge similar way magnet exerts force metallic particle within magnetic field . These force cause movement rotation electrically charge biological building block , much like alignment metallic particle see along line force radiate outwards magnet . Electric field also cause muscle twitch strong enough may heat tissue . TTFields alternate electric field low intensity . This mean change direction repetitively many time second . Since change direction rapidly ( 150 thousand time second ) , cause muscle twitch , effect electrically activate tissue body ( brain , nerve heart ) . Since intensity TTFields body low , cause heating . The breakthrough finding make Novocure finely tune alternate field low intensity , term TTFields ( Tumor Treating Fields ) , cause significant slow growth cancer cell . Due unique geometric shape cancer cell multiply , TTFields cause building block cell move pile way cell physically explode . In addition , cancer cell also contain miniature building block act tiny motor move essential part cell place place . TTFields cause tiny motor fall apart since special type electric charge . As result two effect , cancer tumor growth slow even reverse continuous exposure TTFields . Other cell body ( normal healthy tissue ) affect much less cancer cell since multiply much slow rate . In addition TTFields direct certain part body , leave sensitive area reach . In conclusion , TTField hold promise serve brand new cancer treatment side effect promise affectivity slow reverse disease .</detailed_description>
