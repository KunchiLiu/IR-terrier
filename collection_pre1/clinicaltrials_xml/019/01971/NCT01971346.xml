	<brief_title>The Immunological Basis Treatment Resistance Anti-TNF Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : The balance type I IFN TNF determine response anti-TNF treatment . The goal propose study address hypothesis demonstrate strength type I IFN signature psoriatic skin major determinant clinical response anti-TNF treatment . Purpose : Determine strength type I interferon TNF signal psoriatic skin prior treatment etanercept correlate degree clinical improvement . Study Population : 50 subject , men woman age 18 clinically stable plaque psoriasis , meet wash requirement exclusion criterion Psoriatic patient receive 100 mg etanercept per week ( 2 separate single-use pre-filled 50 mg subcutaneous injection take two separate day ) 3 month . Procedures : Urine pregnancy test , TB test , photography , Physical Examinations , Skin Examinations , Study Drug , Peripheral blood biopsy Anticipated Results : We expect patient strong IFN-α signature psoriatic skin along weak TNF-α signature minimal response anti-TNF treatment , patient opposite pattern , weak IFN strong TNF signature , significant clinical improvement .</detailed_description>
