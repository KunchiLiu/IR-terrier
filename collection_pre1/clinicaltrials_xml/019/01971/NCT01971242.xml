	<brief_summary>This study clinical trial patient Parkinson 's disease , drug call Exenatide already license treatment patient Type 2 Diabetes . There several group confirm Exenatide beneficial effect nerve cell test laboratory , raise possibility Exenatide may slow stop degenerative process Parkinson 's disease . In open label trial patient Parkinson 's disease self administer drug 1 year , previously show drug well tolerate show encourage effect movement non-movement aspect disease , even 2 month patient stop administer drug . The next step therefore formally evaluate whether Exenatide really potential `` neuroprotective '' drug , i.e . stop nerve cell die Parkinson 's disease , conduct double blind , placebo control trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial aim generate data explore whether 48 week exposure Exenatide advantage placebo base standard validated assessment Parkinson 's disease severity ( MDS UPDRS part 3 motor subscale ) . This measure `` practically define OFF medication state '' i.e . patient withhold conventional PD medication overnight . The hypothesis Exenatide associate reduced MDS UPDRS part 3 score study end . To examine safety tolerability 48 week exposure Exenatide patient moderate severity PD . To collect Pharmacokinetic data regard degree penetration Exenatide across blood brain barrier . We hypothesise central effect Exenatide mediate penetration Exenatide across blood brain barrier . Data obtain rodent suggest blood brain barrier penetration excellent . We propose use simple parallel group randomise control trial design . No double blind data support use Exenatide currently available therefore equipoise exists . The null hypothesis Exenatide ( Bydureon ) effect disease progression . Initial identification potential participants- patient attend routine follow appointment inform trial neurologist give participant information sheet . Participants wish consider inclusion trial screen eligibility National Hospital Neurology Neurosurgery , accord inclusion exclusion criterion . A narrative trial participation entail together participant information sheet use educate potential participant . Each patient aware 50 % chance allocate active drug placebo . They confirm willingness attend clinic overnight period without conventional PD medication . As part inform consent , contact detail research team give patient . Written inform consent obtain patient prior enrollment trial . All potential patient properly inform purpose trial potential risks/ benefit know , reasonably predict expect , Investigator train Good Clinical Practice . The investigator retain original copy Informed Consent Form sign patient , duplicate give patient , third copy file patient 's hospital note . Only consent form approve relevant trial ethic committee use . Randomisation Eligible consenting patient randomly allocate 2 group receive either ; Bydureon 2mg subcutaneous injection weekly 48 week n=30 , Bydureon placebo subcutaneous injection weekly 48 week n=30 . Randomisation list sufficiently long enable continued randomisation patient drop within first 12 week study ( prior first follow visit ) . Withdrawal medication All patient continue optimal conventional PD medication administer throughout trial period exception `` medication assessment perform 0,12,24,26,48 60 week . Detailed evaluation patient take place time point National Hospital Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery ( NHNN ) . At assessment patient attend research clinic overnight withdrawal conventional PD medication allow objective measurement PD disability . Patients unable tolerate medication undergo randomisation . Blood test perform visit . At baseline , Blood test include full blood count , urea electrolyte , liver function test , thyroid function test , glucose , HBA1c , amylase save serum . At follow visit , urea electrolyte , thyroid function , serum amylase check serum store . These sample check safety allow measurement Exenatide level perform trial completion . Urine test A urine sample collect visit allow measurement exenatide level trial completion . A pregnancy test also perform female child bear potential baseline visit . Clinical scale Clinical assessment perform visit use validated scale assess movement non movement aspect PD . Vital sign weight measure visit . The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( MDS UPDRS ) . Part 3 scale ( motor subscore ) score absence presence conventional PD medication . Part 1,2 &amp; 4 scale also evaluate presence conventional PD medication ( ON state ) evaluate change non-motor symptom PD , activity daily live complication chronic PD treatment . Unified Dyskinesia Rating scale . This consider useful objective way quantify dyskinesia severity . 3 day Hauser diary PD state ( Time- On , Off , Troublesome Dyskinesia , Non-troublesome dyskinesia , Asleep ) . Diary data allow quantification amount time 7 day period patient spend vary state movement ability . Patients bring diary quantify PD control precede 3 day . Mattis Dementia Rating scale ( DRS-2 ) . This scale validate global measure cognitive ability . Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . This scale allow physician quantification Depression severity . The PDQ39 ( Parkinson 's disease questionnaire-39 ) . This standard disease specific measure quality life PD comprise 39 question . It extensively validate previous study . Non-Motor Symptoms ( NMS ) severity scale . This validated scale tool collect data frequency severity 30 non-motor symptom sometimes experience PD patient . EQ5D ( standardise instrument use measure health outcome ) . This simple 5 question form visual analogue scale allow calculation quality adjust life year ( QALY ) enable health economic analysis perform Timed motor test Patients ask perform Sit-stand-walk time test time keyboard tap leave right hand separately , OFF medication ON medication condition . The timed Sit-stand-walk test incorporate time take seated position stand walk 10 metre , turn return original seat position . Timed keyboard tap use online website Braintaptest.com quantify number alternate tap key `` S '' key `` ; '' use conventional QWERTY ( keyboard layout ) keyboard 30 second period hand turn . The software validate record number key stroke , dwell time , accuracy &amp; rhythmicity automate fashion , freely available online , allow cod repeatable assessment pseudo-anonymised , date/time stamp . Lumbar puncture A lumbar puncture perform 12 week 48 week allow measurement exenatide level trial completion . DaTSCAN A nuclear medicine scan ( DaTSCAN ) perform baseline final visit . Teaching injection Patients teach self administer injection use online teach video support train member trial team . Concomitant treatment Trial participant permit use license PD medication throughout course trial recommend refer neurologist . Analyses Adverse event review quarterly trial management group ( TMG ) meeting 6 monthly independent Data Monitoring committee ( iDMC ) meeting . An interim analysis perform last patient reach 24 week follow result present iDMC make recommendation TMG .</detailed_description>
