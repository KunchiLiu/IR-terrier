	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Exposure vivo therapy aim reduce pain-related fear - key maintain factor chronic low back pain- increase level daily functioning , despite pain . This do exposing patient fear activities/movements , behavioral experiment perform serve correct catastrophic ( erroneous ) belief pain . Yet , perform exposure exercise might threaten patient might encourage build subtle safety-seeking behavior . Whether safety-seeking behavior allow therapy heavily debate . Whereas argue interfere therapeutic progress prevents disconfirming experience exposure try offer , argue facilitate therapeutic progress enhance one 's sense control , use judiciously . So far ( clinical- ) experimental study provide mixed evidence lead clinical recommendation . Hence , replicate single-case experiment , compare exposure therapy versus exposure without safety-seeking behavior versus exposure . STUDY POPULATION : Participants chronic low back pain patient seek treatment , fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion participate voluntarily . INTERVENTION : All participant receive exposure therapy rehabilitation department academic hospital Maastricht , different recommendation use safety-seeking behavior . We assess : 1 ) daily measure fear , pain intensity self-reported achievement goal 2 ) non-daily measure pain disability , pain-related fear , pain catastrophizing , pain solution , need control safety-seeking behavior . To measure influence safety-seeking behavior actual level functioning , two behavioral performance task also present , ie . bag carry task personalize task . BURDEN AND RISKS : There risk associate participation study otherwise relate rehabilitation movement general participation completely voluntary . Participants request fill questionnaire daily basis home ( computerized possible ) , well different time point study follow perform two behavioral performance task . This study could help improve beneficial long-term effect exposure .</brief_summary>
