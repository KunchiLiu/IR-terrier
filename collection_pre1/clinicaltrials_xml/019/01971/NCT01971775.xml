	<brief_summary>Surgery first standard treatment stomach cancer , still negative factor bleed , leakage , closure , surgery part infection cardiovascular lung complication general anesthesia . electric cautery use extensively surgery room due utility simultaneous severance hemostasis . In case , electric current vitality electrode may unexpectedly stimulate damage nearby muscle nerve . Ultrasonically activated shear ( UAS ) device transform protein organ organ incision hemostasis . General advantage possibly include shorten operating time , decrease operative blood loss , relatively less damage normal organ . UAS commonly use operation room , consider secure useful medical device tissue dissection coagulation . Also , expect low risk surgery reduce operating time blood loss . However , clinical evidence sufficient device . Therefore , study , 1 . Evaluate utility , efficacy , safety energy base device , case open gastrectomy 2 . Would like compare follow two kind energy base device . A . For conventional monopolar electrosurgery group : dissection seal conduct conventional monopolar electrocautery device B . For UAS group : dissection seal conduct UAS</brief_summary>
