This intervention , first edition show moderate effect reduce adiposity improve lipid profile , significantly improve overall cardiometabolic risk reduce blood insulin . In second edition ( MOVI-2 ) , increased duration intensity session work development muscle strength . Preliminary analysis also show decrease body fat , reduction global cardiometabolic decrease insulin level . Our project integrate multidimensional intervention promote physical activity , mixed design ( cross-over randomize trial , qualitative study ) two sub-projects share study population , `` Effectiveness intervention physical activity promotion schoolchildren prevent obesity adiposity rebound period : cross-over randomized cluster trial '' `` Effectiveness physical activity intervention prevent obesity improve academic performance child without ADHD risk '' . The two intervention base cross-over randomized trial test effectiveness intervention promote physical activity school environment ( MOVI-KIDS ) , two-year 22 school ( 20 public two private school ) province Cuenca Ciudad Real , Spain . This subproject ( subproject-2 ) ass effectiveness intervention MOVI-KIDS Program improve attention cognition student risk ADHD . Furthermore , project evaluate effectiveness MOVI-KIDS Program improving motor skill academic achievement overall sample , impact change year amount physical activity student sample perform recess . The hypothesis third edition multidimensional intervention promote physical activity child adiposity rebound period ( 4-7 year ) , school environment ( MOVI-KIDS ) , last two-years , : 1 . Reduce body fat percentage intervention group versus control group 2 % child adiposity rebound age ( 4-7 year ) , 2 . Improve academic performance motor skill child without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , 3 .
