	<brief_summary>Urinary symptom must frequent Scleroderma . In one hand , mobility limitation joint stiffness skin sclerosis , force diuresis due heart involvement ( cardiomyopathy pulmonary hypertension ) , diuretic use corticoid-induced hyperglycaemia , well narcotic medication use , put patient high risk secondary bladder fill void dysfunction . In another hand , case report small sample observational study identify specific sclerosis urinary tract . Those two mechanism must frequent diffuse cutaneous form scleroderma ( dcSSc ) compare limited one ( lcSSc ) . But prevalence incidence unknown . Urinary symptom seldom report suffer rarely part systemic evaluation . In threaten disease , urinary symptom assessment might seem priority . But LUTS real impact many aspect everyday living . Furthermore urinary tract involvement might predispose urinary tract infection due flow limitation stagnation . Since inner fibrosis might associate aggressive form disease confer great loss physical function , high risk hospital admission death . Thus , identify urinary symptom would permit address specific rehabilitation medication therapy , order minimize consequence bothersome symptom identify subject high risk urinary infection , aggressive disease/loss function death . This study also give basement build interventional study direct toward LUTS treatment population . In prospective cohort would like : - Compare prevalence low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) diffuse limit form systemic sclerosis . - Determine prevalence ( inclusion ) incidence ( two year period ) LUTS among patient suffer systemic sclerosis . - Evaluate impact LUTS symptom Quality life . - Compare discrimination ability Cochin-hand score HAQ score predict incontinence population . - Evaluate association LUTS symptom , hospital admission rate , urinary tract infection , mortality loss autonomy .</brief_summary>
