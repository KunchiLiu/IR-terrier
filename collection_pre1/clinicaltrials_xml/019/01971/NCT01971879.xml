	<brief_title>Protection Arteritic Patients Remote Preconditioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients screen amongst arteritic patient undergone positive treadmill test Angers University Hospital , define premature test stop cause muscular pain associate trans-cutaneous pressure oxygen ( TCPO2 ) drop . After sign informed consent , patient take two treadmill test week-span . According randomization , patient undergo `` remote preconditioning '' procedure `` control '' procedure first treadmill test . The following week , respect cross-over strategy patient undergo procedure second treadmill test . Only study nurse advise procedure . Investigators inform allocated procedure . Patients informed procedure suppose beneficial effect . The treadmill test run accord calibrate protocol . After 2-minute stand-up resting period , treadmill progressively speed 3.2km/h one minute . This stage maintain 10 % slope 14 minute . Then , treadmill 's slope speed increase progressively every minute accord calibrate protocol . The test duration measure start walk patient 's request stop pain low limb . TCPO2 measure test gluteus leg . Tissue oxygenation lower limb measure Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy ( NIRO-200NX system ) . Oxygen consumption analyse throughout test . A blood sample drawn start test , 5 minute end last cuff deflation . A second blood sample drawn 2 minute patient 's request stop walking . These blood sample compose one 3ml tube measure blood lactate level , one 6ml ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) tube 5ml plain tube . These two last tube centrifuge subsampled build bio-collection store local Biological Resources Center .</detailed_description>
