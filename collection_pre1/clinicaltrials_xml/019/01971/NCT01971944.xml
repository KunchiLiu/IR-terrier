	<brief_summary>Purpose : To compare hemodynamic effect dobutamine milrinone hospitalize patient receive Beta Blocker Participants : Patients admit General Cardiology Heart Failure Services University North Carolina Hospitals acute decompensated heart failure , maintain steady state concentration beta blocker therapy ( carvedilol metoprolol ) , deem health care team require pulmonary artery catheter placement inotropic therapy dobutamine milrinone continuous infusion . Patients currently receive beta blocker therapy enrol comparative purpose ; however , patient steady state ( beta blocker therapy ) enrol . Procedures : After obtain informed consent , patient assign appropriate sub-study group base beta blocker use ( Study A : patient stable dos metoprolol Study B : patient stable dos carvedilol ) . All patient receive dobutamine follow milrinone outline dose algorithm ( see inotrope dose algorithm attach , part usual standard practice ) . Baseline pulmonary artery catheter hemodynamic parameter collect prior administration inotrope trial dobutamine follow milrinone . Hemodynamic parameter record per dose algorithm follow initiation dose titration . Dose titration determine health care team base upon patient response lack thereof tolerability . Changes hemodynamic parameter response dobutamine milrinone compare within study group . Additionally , data continue collect patient receive beta blocker therapy comparative purpose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence Beta Blocker Therapy Hemodynamic Response Inotrope Infusion Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : First-line management chronic heart failure include beta blocker angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , agent show significant benefit morbidity mortality large clinical trial . Therefore , substantial number patient chronic heart failure receive chronic beta blocker therapy , commonly metoprolol succinate carvedilol . However , despite significant advancement treatment chronic heart failure , natural history disease remain progressive many patient develop acute decompensations require hospitalization . In set acute decompensated heart failure , use inotropic agent may require hemodynamic support . The two widely use inotropes dobutamine milrinone . Dobutamine primarily act beta-1 receptor agonist effect beta-2 alpha-1 receptor . Milrinone phosphodiesterase III inhibitor , thus inhibit breakdown cyclic adenosine monophosphate . As , milrinone work site distal beta receptor may less influenced chronic beta blocker therapy . As , one may speculate presence beta blocker would influence hemodynamic response dobutamine , much less extent milrinone , . Two small study assess hemodynamic response dobutamine presence absence beta blocker therapy patient chronic heart failure . In addition , one study assess response enoximone , another phosphodiesterase III inhibitor . Both study demonstrate metoprolol significantly affect hemodynamic response dobutamine infusion , include effect cardiac index , heart rate , stroke volume , systemic vascular resistance . Conversely , carvedilol show significant inhibitory effect cardiac index , heart rate , stroke volume dobutamine infusion . In addition , carvedilol appear increase mean arterial pressure high dos dobutamine . In set enoximone infusion , metoprolol increase cardiac index stroke volume response , maintain hemodynamic parameter . There significant difference hemodynamic response enoximone infusion presence carvedilol . Why This Study Needed : Published study assess hemodynamic response inotropes presence absence beta blocker include less 50 patient combine . As , replication result warrant order use data drive change clinical practice . Additionally , equally important , study publish , best knowledge , assess hemodynamic response milrinone presence metoprolol . . Although enoximone phosphodiesterase III inhibitor theoretically similar milrinone , approve use United States , thus make difficult extrapolate finding milrinone . Lastly , severity illness patient include current literature reflect individual receive benefit therapy i.e . patient acute decompensated heart failure .</detailed_description>
