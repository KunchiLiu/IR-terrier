	<brief_summary>Poor Ecuadorian old people suffer chronic dietary deficiency zinc , iron , copper , vitamins C , B6 , B12 , D , folic acid . The investigator previously show deficiency associate impaired immune function increase incidence respiratory infection ( RI ) . The hypothesis correction specific nutrient deficiency improve immune response thereby enhance resistance respiratory infection . To test hypothesis study evaluate effect supplementation specific vitamins mineral find deficient poor elderly Ecuadorians marker immune function incidence RI . A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial 320 old people ( ≥65 ) carry Quito , Ecuador . Participants receive multivitamin mineral supplement placebo tablet daily 12 month . Nutrients provide US Recommended Daily Allowance ( RDA ) level , except vitamin C zinc dos , 5 time 1.25 time higher RDA , respectively . Incidence respiratory infection ( primary outcome ) assess weekly field nurse physician study team . Secondary outcome include delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) skin test , cathelicidin production mucosa respiratory cell , serum C-reactive protein ( CRP ) measure immune function . Blood micronutrient level haemoglobin status collect measure adherence trial regimen . Incidence rate RI rate ratio ( RR ) calculate quantify effect intervention incidence respiratory infection . This first trial kind conduct specifically population old people know poor micronutrient status . The finding study may important similar population low- middle-income country .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Even `` subtle subclinical deficiency micronutrient inadequate macronutrient intake contribute decline immune function elderly '' [ 1 ] . `` The impaired regulation immune system age contributes higher morbidity mortality infection , autoimmune , neoplastic disease '' [ 1 ] . Some study show either vitamin mineral supplement may improve immune function old subject [ 2-5 ] . Therefore , plausible assume improvement nutritional status MVM supplement may benefit ability fight infection . The hormonal physiological deregulation age might also benefit MVM add body effectiveness deal common pathogens age . A previous systematic review meta-analysis randomise control trial ( RCT ) , include paper publish January 2004 , find evidence effect MVM supplementation infection rate [ 6 ] duration [ 7 ] old people . However , considerable clinical methodological heterogeneity present study include earlier review . The investigator update earlier systematically review evidence MVM supplementation effective reduce incidence infection old people . Sub-group analysis explore effect site residence ( nurse home dwelling ) study participant , primary outcome measure ( self report clinical evaluation ) , baseline micronutrient status enrol subject [ 8 ] . The investigator find evidence benefit multivitamin mineral supplementation rate infection odds ratio infection age subject . The investigator also find benefit intervention subgroup analyse . Sensitivity analysis study evaluate free bias substantially alter conclusion . The included trial heterogeneous sample size ( range 33 2799 ) , duration ( range 4 24 month ) , outcome measure . The lack benefit intervention study find variable percent subject micronutrient deficiency enrolment could relate characteristic included trial : All study Avenell [ 9 ] determine micronutrient status target population enrolment . Therefore , formula multivitamin mineral supplement use aim correct pre-specified deficiency . Moreover , study different consideration define formula , explain large variability supplement across study . Finally , assessment micronutrient status also variable across study : dietary intake evaluation and/or micronutrient blood concentration , affect consistency subgroup meta-analysis . It noteworthy study except one [ 10 ] carry developed country nutritional status age population seem well report study carry develop country . In fact , although variability assessment method allow draw clear conclusion baseline nutritional status subject include analysed study , prevalence deficiency number micronutrient find deficient evidently low referred study develop country carry Ecuador [ 11 ] . The remain study carry middle-income country although data baseline nutritional status enrol subject publish , presumably micronutrient status somehow similar find developed country . Based consideration , would novel find evidence support hypothesis benefit improve vitamin mineral consumption , enhance immune function decrease infectious disease episodes elderly suffer extent multiple micronutrient deficiency develop country . Our research group first study nutritional , immunological , health status Ecuadorian old people , live poor peri-urban neighbourhood Quito , city Andean Region . The investigator carry preliminary study 145 old people ( age ≥65 year ) , reveal inadequate intake protein multiple micronutrient well high prevalence recall infectious disease assess physician hospital visit [ 12 ] . To good define finding , investigator perform large adequately power cross-sectional study Quito 352 old people ( 225 woman ) , whose result publish two article . [ 1 , 11 ] Substantial deficiency ( &gt; 30 % subject ) serum/blood concentration find vitamin C ( 47 % ) , folate ( 32 % ) , zinc ( 43 % ) [ 1 ] . More 20 % subject also vitamins B6 , B12 deficient [ 1 ] . Severe vitamin D deficiency find &lt; 15 % subject moderate deficiency find 65 % male , 87 % female [ 11 ] . Moreover , 30 % men 40 % woman anaemic base altitude-adjusted haemoglobin value [ 1 , 13 ] . When dietary intake assess percent deficient subject even high [ 11 ] . There correlation dietary intake blood concentration micronutrient [ 11 ] . Therefore , old Ecuadorians suffer multiple micronutrient deficiency due mainly dietary restriction . This situation make amenable MVM intervention aim correct nutritional status . Blood deficiency one follow micronutrient vitamin C , vitamin E , pyridoxal5-phosphate ( PLP ) , folate , iron , zinc strongly associate history RI ( OR 4.0 ; 1.76 , 9.06 ) [ 1 ] . Delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) considerably low observe US elderly especially Trichophyton tetanus toxoid [ 1 ] DTH vivo indicator cellular immune response status . Vitamin C zinc concentration significantly associate Interferon gamma ( IFN-γ ) concentration [ 1 ] . Serum iron zinc significantly associate Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) level [ 1 ] . Since IFN-γ IL-2 T-dependent cytokine correlation suggest deficiency micronutrient may explain impaired cellular immune response assess DTH . High plasma CRP ( &gt; 3 mg/l ) present 49 % participant , could proxy increase pro-inflammatory cytokine [ 11 ] . There correlation protein , carbohydrate , lipid intake immune response infection . Taken together , data previous study Ecuador suggest risk infection impair immune function associate deficiency critical vitamin mineral Ecuadorian old people . Although important cautious conclude study due cross-sectional design , seem necessary evaluate nutritional intervention intend provide micronutrient find deficient improve immune health status elderly Ecuadorians . This approach different previous trial carry developed country evaluate micronutrient status target population enrolment , consequence , define MVM formula aim correct specific deficiency . Moreover , micronutrient deficiency find Ecuadorian old subject appear affect largely high percent subject include micronutrient find enrolment subject include study carry developed country . Therefore , hypothesis provision MVM supplement poor Ecuadorian subject aim correct specific micronutrient deficiency may prove beneficial reduce incidence respiratory infection via improvement immune response assess DTH test , decrease CRP concentration proxy regulation pro-inflammatory cytokine . Since cathelicidin , antimicrobial peptide produce neutrophil , seem increase vitamin D status [ 14 ] , measure peptide supernatant culture cell upper respiratory mucosa include . Thus , DTH cathelicidin would provide assessment innate adaptive immunity . This study first undertaken age population develop country .</detailed_description>
