	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers want know certain type antibody blood affect whether people get influenza ( flu ) . They study 2 different group different level anti-HA antibody expose flu virus . They study flu develops healthy person . This may lead future study develop new vaccine treatment flu . Objective : - To study people protect flu infection . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 50 year age . Design : - Participants screen use medical history , physical exam , laboratory test . - Groups 7 participant stay isolation unit hospital least 9 day visitor . - Participants screen upon admission . They also : - ECG : soft electrode stuck skin . A machine record heart electrical signal . - Echocardiogram : small probe hold chest take picture heart . - Lung test : participant blow machine . - They also nasal fluid collect . This do either swab tube water wash nose . This do every day . - The flu virus spray participant nose . This do . - Participants complete questionnaire day 1 twice day 14 day . - A medical team watch participant 24 hour day . They go home 2 day negative flu test . - Participants 4 follow-up visit 8 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Anti-Hemagglutinin ( Anti-HA ) Antibodies Protection From Flu Healthy People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high morbidity mortality associate pandemic seasonal influenza , threat new pandemic strain emerge , continue keep influenza forefront infectious disease public health research . Mean annual estimate influenza death due seasonal influenza alone , attribute 36,000 death US 250,000 500,000 death industrialized country influenza . Pandemics even devastate effect , must continue prepared make attempt reduce public health impact important virus . Currently , influenza vaccination cornerstone prophylaxis effective method available reduce impact influenza world population year . Data 2013 influenza season suggest current seasonal vaccine hold standard greatly underperform especially really need protection elderly , young , infirmed . Multiple factor could play role define true correlate protection influenza infection disease many factor yet clearly define . In influenza challenge study , protocol 12-I-0077 , clearly see evidence everyone low HAI titer susceptible influenza , must factor protect certain individual . There many example like demonstrate may much immune protection influenza anti-HA antibody . Live virus challenge study play important role define correlate protection influenza past , believe continue future . Since last time wild-type influenza challenge perform investigate correlate protection 20 year ago , many new scientific tool significant increase knowledge immune system develop . In study enroll participant different hemagglutinin inhibition titer level evaluate correlate protection 2009 H1N1 explore possible correlate protection may identify . This study represent first opportunity examine correlate protection influenza fully validate described wild-type virus challenge model . We believe study like ideal use wild-type influenza challenge study lead intelligent universal vaccine design well basis begin evaluate novel vaccine strategy wild-type challenge study future .</detailed_description>
