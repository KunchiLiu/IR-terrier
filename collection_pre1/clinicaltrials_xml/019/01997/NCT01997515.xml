	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic surgery gastric reduction frequently associate high level postoperative pain . Postoperative pain often treat opioids . However large dos opioids result respiratory depression hypoxemia especially high risk patient obstructive sleep apnea . since large group patient undergo surgery gastric reduction surgery also obstructive sleep apnea , expect patient also high risk postoperative respiratory depression hypoxemia . Intraoperative ketamine use effective multimodal agent reduce postoperative pain . However , ketamine alone examine improve postoperative pain outcome patient undergo gastric reduction surgery . More importantly , unknown use intraoperative ketamine lead well overall quality recovery patient population . In addition , ketamine show improve ventilation remain determined intraoperative use ketamine result less postoperative hypoxemic event . The main objective current investigation examine effect intraoperative ketamine postoperative quality recovery gastric reduction surgery . The investigator hypothesize subject receive ketamine great global quality recovery score one receive saline . The investigator also seek determine intraoperative ketamine would decrease incidence postoperative hypoxemic event patient population .</brief_summary>
