	<brief_summary>The availability HIV care treatment program increase sub-Saharan Africa . However half patient need HIV treatment still receive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . This lead early death AIDS . Additionally , many patient start ART late HIV disease advance . This result high death rate soon start ART . The factor contribute late ART initiation still unclear . This study identify factor help patient enroll prevent enrol HIV care start ART time . We examine characteristic patient initiate ART study site . We also look potential risk factor among patient initiate ART late ( case ) compare patient initiate earlier ( control ) 6 HIV care treatment clinic Ethiopia . Data collect use 2 method : 1 . Face-to-face interview participant use questionnaire 2 . Obtaining clinical data electronic patient-level database Identifying factor help patient start prevent start ART time help direct intervention , program policy reduce early death .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-level Determinants Starting ART Late : Aim 3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Although HIV care treatment program scale sub-Saharan Africa , 50 % patient need ART receive still significant mortality AIDS . One major challenge high rate late ART initiation ( i.e. , advance stage HIV disease ) result high rate mortality soon initiation ART . The individual-level factor contribute late ART initiation still unclear . Objective : As 3rd part 3-phase NIH-sponsored project , study aim identify individual-level enablers barrier timely enrollment HIV care ART initiation . Methods : We recruit patient newly initiate ART study site descriptive analysis ( approximately 1,200 ) . As sub-analysis , utilize case-control approach examine potential individual risk factor ( e.g . knowledge behavior around HIV care treatment , experience stigma , perceive barrier enablers earlier HIV diagnosis , enrollment care , ART initiation ) among 360 patient initiated ART late ( CD4 count &lt; 150 cells/µL compare 360 patient initiate earlier ( CD4≥200 ) 6 HIV care treatment clinic Ethiopia . For descriptive study case-control study , data collect use 2 method : 1 . Face-to-face interview participant use structured questionnaire 2 . Abstraction clinical data electronic patient-level database capture patient information baseline , 6 12 month enrollment study Expected use result : Identifying individual-level enablers barrier timely ART initiation facilitate implementation intervention , program policy mitigate problem late ART initiation .</detailed_description>
