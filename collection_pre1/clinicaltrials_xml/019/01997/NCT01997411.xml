	<brief_title>Assessment Intranasal Glucagon Children Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucagon , treatment choice severe hypoglycemia outside hospital setting , currently available powder must mix diluent immediately prior administration injection . Although simple procedure insulin-using individual , subject experience severe hypoglycemia inject glucagon disable effect severe neuroglycopenia . For non-medical person confront emergency situation patient diabetes hypoglycemic coma suffer hypoglycemia-related convulsion , reconstitution injection current injectable glucagon complex daunt procedure . When use recommend dose 1 mg injection , glucagon often cause substantial , although transient , hyperglycemia often accompany nausea vomiting . The data generate date AMG504-1 suggest result glucagon pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , although less observed injected glucagon , result therapeutic blood glucose increment low incidence gastrointestinal adverse effect . Caregivers child adolescent type 1 diabetes call upon treat episode severe hypoglycemia may want use AMG504-1 . This study conduct permit determination appropriate dose level ( ) pediatric use base safety observation result glucagon glucose assay . Each participant 12.0 less 17.0 year age underwent two visit random order receive AMG504-1 one visit commercially available glucagon ( GlucaGen , Novo Nordisk ) IM injection visit . Participants 4.0 less 12.0 year randomly assign either 1 visit commercially available glucagon ( GlucaGen , Novo Nordisk ) IM injection OR 2 visit 2.0 mg dose AMG504-1 administer one visit 3.0 mg dose AMG504-1 administer visit . For randomized complete two research dose visit , dose intranasal glucagon give visit mask participant study personnel . Each dose visit consist reduce plasma glucose level 80 mg/dL increase basal insulin infusion rate insulin pump intravenous ( IV ) infusion regular insulin dilute normal saline . The insulin infusion stop plasma glucose &lt; 80 mg/dL . Five minute stop insulin infusion , participant treat either glucagon give intranasally ( either 2.0 mg 3.0 mg participant 4.0 less 12.0 year age 3.0 mg 12.0 less 17.0 year age ) intramuscular ( IM ) injection ( 1 mg constitute 1 mL dilute solution 55 lb 0.5 mg constitute 1 mL dilute solution weigh less 55 lb ) quadriceps muscle leg . Blood glucose level adverse event carefully monitor 90 minute post-dosing . After wash-out period 7 day , participant 12.0 less 17.0 year age return clinic procedure repeat participant cross treatment . Participants 4.0 less 12.0 year assign 2 dose visit return clinic repeated procedure different dose intranasal glucagon give . Participants 4.0 less 12.0 year assign single dose visit return second dose visit .</detailed_description>
