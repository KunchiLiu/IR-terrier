	<brief_title>Colonic Stenting With Elective Surgery Versus Emergency Surgery Management Acute Malignant Colonic Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer one commonly diagnosed malignancy worldwide , estimate 10 million new case 6 million death . Around 8 % -29 % patient colorectal cancer present acute colonic obstruction , 70 % malignant obstruction occur left-sided colon . It report 15 % -20 % patient colorectal cancer present acute obstructive symptom time diagnosis . Conventionally , patient treat emergency surgery restore luminal continuity , include variety strategy so-called two-stage surgery involve primary resection colostomy ( i.e. , Hartmann 's procedure ) proximal colostomy follow resection , one-stage surgery involve primary resection anastomosis . Whatever strategy choose , emergency surgery associate high risk morbidity mortality , two-thirds patient end permanent stoma , cause low health-related quality life cost associate stoma care . Since 1991 , colonic stenting applied palliative treatment patient unresectable colorectal cancer . In 1993 , Tejero et al . report use colonic stenting bridge definitive surgery . Recently , Zhang et al . conduct meta-analysis 8 study ( 6 retrospective 2 randomized trial ) indicate stent placement elective surgery , also know bridge surgery , lead reduction need intensive care ( risk ratio [ RR ] , 0.42 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.19-0.93 ) , stoma creation ( RR , 0.70 ; 0.50-0.99 ) , overall complication ( RR , 0.42 ; 0.24-0.71 ) compare emergency surgery cohort , meanwhile , colonic stenting elective surgery achieve high primary anastomosis rate ( RR , 1.62 ; 1.21-2.16 ) , adversely affect mortality long-term survival . The common complication colonic stenting re-obstruction ( 12 % ) , migration ( 11 % ) , perforation ( 4.5 % ) . However , available body literature address benefit colonic stenting elective surgery contradictory , limited lack prospective randomise controlled trial . Therefore , plan conduct multicenter , prospective , open label , cohort study , determine efficacy safety colonic stenting elective surgery versus emergency surgery management acute malignant colonic obstruction .</detailed_description>
