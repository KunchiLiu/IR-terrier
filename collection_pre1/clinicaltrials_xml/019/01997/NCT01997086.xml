	<brief_title>Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy v Microendoscopic Discectomy Treatment Lumbar Disc Herniation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumbar disc herniation ( LDH ) common pathological process lead spinal surgery . Open discectomy use widespread procedure surgical treatment symptomatic LDH . Currently , rapid progress endoscopic technique , several minimal invasive endoscopic surgery develop perform discectomy . Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy ( PTED ) microendoscopic discectomy ( MED ) two widely use minimal invasive surgical procedure , effectiveness prove comparable conventional open discectomy . As difference operative approach iatrogenic injury , clinical outcome might dramatically different . In study , single center randomize control trial perform evaluate effectiveness two minimal invasive endoscopic discectomy , PTED MED , treatment symptomatic LDH . We conduct study 3rd affiliated hospital Sun Yat-Sen University . Two group patient investigate ; 1 ) patient diagnose lumbar disc herniation undergo PTED , 2 ) patient diagnose lumbar disc herniation undergoing MED . The primary endpoint study change Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) measure pre- post-operation , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , annually thereafter . Secondary outcome include Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , SF-36 Health Survey , well post-operative radiological assessment . Treatment effect define difference mean change baseline two group . Lumbar intervertebral disc tissue would obtain surgery histological analysis , order evaluate disc degeneration find risk factor . On basis result trial , first time , scientific evidence relative effectiveness PTED versus MED minimal invasive surgical treatment symptomatic lumbar disc herniation .</detailed_description>
