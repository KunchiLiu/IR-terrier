	<brief_summary>The propose protocol involve replacement trachea use synthetic bioengineered scaffold seed autologous mononuclear cell intraoperative solution patient benign malignant laryngo-tracheal disease terminal condition trachea . Tracheal transplant indicate therapeutic alternative case instrumental , endoscopic evaluation show length residual healthy airway ( 6 cm longer 50 % airway length ) localization extension obstruction make impossible perform surgical resection pathological segment . In addition tracheal surgical transplant technique , protocol require knowledge experience autologous cell preparation well scaffold seed procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before transplantation patient laboratory instrumental evaluation . Three day transplantation patient underwent bone marrow aspiration . The bone marrow mononuclear cell ( MNC ) isolate red blood cell ( RBC ) totally enclosed FDA approve automatic system ( Sepax , BioSafe America , Inc. ) . The final product , re-suspended cell culture medium ( DMEM+10 % albumin 10 % autologous plasma ) volume 200 mL , place 600 mL transfer bag . 2 mL product take bag clinical use test sterility use culture medium immunofluorescent cytometry characterize cell type viability . Two day transplant , patient begin `` boosting '' therapy mobilize cell mean systemic injection analogous recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( GCSF ) ( Granocyte , 1 M IU/kg ( max . 15 M IU ) Erythropoietin , 400 IU/kg ( max.6,000IU ) . These injected two day prior surgery . InBreath Bioreactor ( special bioreactor cultivate trachea ) The work current protocol involve bioreactor design previously utilized Macchiarini P. ang college successful first-in-man implantation tissue-engineered large airway replacement . The device , commercialize name , InBreath 3D Organ Bioreactor ( Harvard Bioscience , Inc. ) design placement within tissue culture incubator consist modular polysulphone organ chamber , motor unit remote controller . The chamber easily detachable motor unit polysulphone construction permit sterilization standard gas plasma sterilization process readily available operate room Peoria . The motor unit provide consistent rotation tissue holder within chamber , ensure control application hydrodynamic shear force develop tracheal construct . A fully enclose motor housing protects brushless motor corrosive moisture within incubator . The remote control unit place outside incubator provide mean adjust rotational speed without disturb incubator environment . The seeded construct allow incubate bioreactor 96 hour prior removal implantation . Based five previous adult case use POSS-PCU ( Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-poly ( carbonate-urea ) urethane ) , PET ( Polyethylene terephthalate ) PET : PU ( Polyurethane ) synthetic scaffold , internal external surface scaffold seed freshly isolate bone marrow mononuclear cell fraction . The bioreactor start initial speed 0.5 cycles/min 18 hour ( stepwise increase 2.5 cycles/min ) . Incubation 48 hour precede transplant procedure . This incubation protocol work well previous case use three different synthetic nanocomposite tracheal scaffold . Cultivation step : The tracheal reseed procedure do aseptic culture GMP ( Good Manufacturing Practice ) facility establish fully functional . 1 . Isolated MNC prepared accord Sepax 2 protocol bone marrow separation resuspend 300ml bag contain 0.9 % Normal saline solution ( 10 % human albumin ) . 2 . The sterilized scaffold ( gamma irradiation sterilization ) , bioreactor ( plasma sterilization ) surgical instrument ( autoclave ) place laminar hood . 3 . All person manipulate cells/bioreactor scaffold fully train GMP grade standard , namely sterile glove , specific overall , etc . 4 . The bioreactor open inside hood sterile condition place sterile tissue . The scaffold mount organ hold fixture place bioreactor . Once scaffold transfer fix bioreactor MNC ( +DMEM plus albumin autologous plasma ) seed scaffold´s surface . Medium ( include autologous plasma human albumin ) add bioreactor chamber total volume 200 ml . 5 . The factor add medium : 39.3 ng/mL ( 100 nmol/L ) dexamethasone , 10 μg/mL insulin . 6 . Then bioreactor chamber ( include scaffold , MNC + 200 ml medium ) place incubator mount onto motor unit bioreactor ( previously place inside incubator ) . 7 . The bioreactor start initial speed 0.5 cycle/min 18h ( stepwise increase 2.5 cycles/min ) . 8 . After 24h , additional 50ml prementioned medium added total volume 250ml inside chamber . At time small aliquot chamber fluid test gram stain injected culture medium check contamination . 9 . After 48 hour chamber open aliquot harvested culture Gram stain . A small biopsy neotrachea take MTT viability test . Once determined cell viable sign medium contamination ( Gram stain interim reading direct inoculation culture ) trachea deem ready implantation patient place anesthesia surgical procedure start . Day transplantation : Intra-operative Surgical Procedure The morning transplant graft test cell growth ( MTT test sterility gram stain analysis interim culture result ) . Once graft deem ready implantation , patient place general endotracheal anesthesia . Thoracic abdominal procedure Having perform resection airway 's damage segment , airway construct seed intraoperatively respiratory cell biopsy internal surface . The graft inject ( condition ) growth factor include 10 ng/mL recombinant human transform growth factor-β 3 , 10 nmol/L recombinant parathyroid hormone-related peptide , 100 nmol/L dexamethasone , 10 µg/mL insulin , GCSF ( 10 µg/kg ) Erythropoietin ( 40,000 UI ) ( stimulate mobilization peripheral hematopoietic cell ) . The implant anastomose proximally distally reconstruct airway defect use suture . It cover wrap omentum major flap ( adipose vascularize tissue detach large bend stomach , harvest right left gastroepiploic artery carry mediastinum trans-diaphragmatically sub-sternally ) , guarantee long-term protection graft anastomosis obtain indirect graft 's neovascularisation . After transplantation : Post-operative treatment To boost regenerative process , patient ( current weight 13 Kg ) treat pharmacologically post-op period systemic injection : 1 . Analogous recombinant GCSF ( Granocyte , 10 million IU/kg maximum 30 million IU ) 2 . Analogous synthetic Erythropoietin ( Epoetin alpha beta 40,000 IU ) Both factor administer suitable concentration stimulate mobilization/recruitment hematopoietic cell , `` regenerative '' dos associate side-effects . Every second day plasma Erythropoietin level blood count ( include haemoglobin white blood cell count ) monitor . Haemoglobin level great 15 g/dl raise concern hyper-viscosity prompt removal 10-20 cc/kg blood may prompt addition continuous infusion heparin keep Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( APTT ) level 40-60 second . White blood cell level 50-60,000/μl consider `` toxic '' result reduction/suspension GCSF therapy number fall 30,000 . Treatment GCSF Erythropoietin carry every day 2 week follow transplant accord follow table : Follow-up The follow-up carried Cardiothoracic Surgery Department Krasnodar Regional Hospital , include : 1 . Endoscopic evaluation ( flexible and/or rigid bronchoscopy ) transplant airway every day first week every day second week , month first six month , every 6 month thereafter first 5 year . 2 . Evaluation blood count white blood cell formula daily first two week . 3 . Evaluation mobilize progenitor cell peripheral blood every second day 2 week . 4 . Immunogenic evaluation . After 3 , 7 30 day transplant , blood sample take make study histocompatibility evaluate antibody . The immunogenic follow-up also carry 3 , 6 12 month transplant . 5 . Post-operative Tobramycin inhalation ( 2x5ml/day 30 day ) prevent pneumonia graft bacterial contamination . 6 . Computerized tomography neck chest three-dimensional reconstruction transplant airway do month 1 , month 3 month 6 follow-up , every 6 month thereafter first 5 year .</detailed_description>
