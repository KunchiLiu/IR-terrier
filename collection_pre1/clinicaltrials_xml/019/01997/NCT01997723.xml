	<brief_summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) under-diagnosed associate increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Laboratory-based overnight polysomnography ( PSG ) gold standard clinical practice diagnose OSA availability , cost , resource limitation . In last decade , alternative diagnostic strategy , Portable Monitoring ( PM ) emerge goal reduce expense delay clinical management . In contrast PSG , PM maybe perform unattended home , utilize different neurophysiologic cardiorespiratory parameter , may synthesize data differently . PM feasible approve Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) United States . However , diagnostic utility PM minority underserved population define . African-Americans severely affected hypertension cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) ethnic group OSA common population . OSA treatable cause hypertension . Despite impact timely intervention OSA health outcome risk reduction specific African Americans unknown . Purpose research : In view vulnerability population potential improvement healthcare access OSA home-based diagnosis , study aim establish feasibility identify potential advantage limitation home-based diagnosis OSA high-risk urban African-American population include veteran frequently limit access healthcare . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize home-based PM inferior standard laboratory-based PSG effectively diagnose OSA urban African Americans .</brief_summary>
