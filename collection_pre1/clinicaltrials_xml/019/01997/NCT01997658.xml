	<brief_summary>Background : Reducing postoperative complication remain dominant challenge clinician . By minimize incidence adverse outcome , health care cost patient recovery improve . A number study document few postoperative adverse event occur preoperative use glucocorticoid ( GC ) . Two small manuscript support use GC particular reference liver resection . Major hepatectomy associate numerous adverse outcome ( hemorrhage , bile leak , liver failure , wound infection infectious complication ) . This rate approach 54 % trial . Additionally , liver responsible numerous metabolic function actively participate acute phase response via generation inflammatory mediator cytokine . Glucocorticoids play important role suppress over-synthesis pro-inflammatory cytokine therefore may assist reduce postoperative complication . These pro-inflammatory cytokine recruit leukocytes site injury , lead hepatic parenchymal cell damage . Decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine ratio may therefore reduce hepatic damage . Methods : The investigator complete randomize controlled trial evaluate incidence postoperative complication overall hospital length stay adult patient follow preoperative vs. administration 500 mg methylprednisolone ( MP ) within 30 minute start hepatectomy . This trial employ block randomization intention treat protocol . Four HPB surgeon University Calgary participate trial plan inclusion patient schedule undergo hepatectomy period 2 year .

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Major hepatectomy lead significant postoperative anatomical physiological change . The liver dictate systemic metabolic environment help maintain homeostasis . When segment liver remove , challenge regenerate restore cellular volume , well continue perform mandate metabolic function . Major hepatectomy result multiple complication ( hemorrhage , biliary fistula , wound infection , liver failure ) overall complication rate 54 % study . Recent study purport preoperative administration GC may suppress acute phase response early postoperative period . GCs steroid hormone variety immunological biochemical function ( anti-inflammatory attenuation acute phase response bind intra-cytoplasmic GC receptor therefore increase transcription anti-inflammatory protein interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , IL-1-receptor antagonist ( IL-Ra ) , lipocortin-1 neutral endopeptidase , direct inhibition activate transcription factor ( nuclear factor kB , activator protein-1 ) ) . GC also suppress gene expression alter chromatin structure tighten DNA coil . The acute phase response neuro-humoral time-limited defensive mechanism , aim restore homeostasis . It characterize fever , leukocytosis , gluconeogenesis , well change lipid , carbohydrate protein metabolism . Activation hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis , coagulation compliment pathway also one salient feature acute phase response . It regulate cytokine receptor antagonist ( IL-1Ra ) soluble cytokine receptor . Cytokines soluble , low molecular weight glycoprotein act inflammatory mediator broadly divide pro anti-inflammatory cytokine . At low concentration , paracrine effect , high concentration act systemically . These pro-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-6 tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha ) remain plasma least 24 hour generation . They also attract leukocyte ( neutrophils macrophage ) site injury detrimental produce large amount . Oka et al demonstrate increase level IL-6 directly relate increased rate postoperative complication . In low dos , GC reduce short term mortality , reverse shock process improve hemodynamics septic shock patient . In meta-analysis 17 RCTs , Annane et al find 28-day mortality low-dose dexamethasone ( DXA ) group , versus control group 35.3 % vs. 38.5 % . Shock reversal also increase DXA group ( 66.9 % vs. 58.6 % ) ICU stay decrease 4.49 day . Preoperative use GC improve cardiac function coronary artery bypass grafting . The likely underlying mechanism cardio-protective effect reduce release pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-alpha concurrent increase release anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 . In case laparoscopic cholecystectomy , 50 % 75 % patient express nausea vomit early postoperative period . In meta-analysis , Karanicolas et al find absolute risk nausea low risk patient . Similarly DXA decrease absolute risk vomit 12 % 5 % low risk 30 % 12 % high risk group compare placebo . Although quality evidence low regard postoperative pain post-cholecystectomy patient , researcher find less postoperative pain DXA group . Gomez-Hernandez et al also suggest preoperative single dose DXA decrease postoperative nausea , vomit pain patient undergo mastectomy ( 28.6 % vs. 60 % early postoperative period ) . The patient placebo group require anti-emetic medication . DXA reduce postoperative pain significantly few patient request analgesia ( 10 vs. 21 ) . Additionally increase adverse event , morbidity mortality steroid group . Preoperative use DXA significantly improve postoperative pain , nausea , vomit vocal function within first 48 hour thyroid surgery . Subclinical renal dysfunction frequently note follow liver transplantation . This occur mainly due hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury . Turner et al suggest GC decrease incidence renal tubular dysfunction give time induction anesthesia . The main difference serum creatinine level note postoperative day 3 ( 164.8 mumol/L saline group vs. 88.5 mumol/L MP group ) . Additionally , patient saline group suffer complication ( 47 % vs. 12 % ) . Studies suggest GC limit peritoneal inflammatory response therefore help recovery fatigue early postoperative period . Low level IL-6 IL-13 find peritoneal fluid patient receive GC postoperative day 1 . Schulze et al observe improved pulmonary function early mobilization MP group , compare placebo , colon surgery patient . Furthermore , note significant decrease IL-6 , C reactive protein pain score . The appetite increase significantly patient GC , however difference wound heal infectious complication ( include anastomotic leak ) . In colorectal surgery , GC appear increase postoperative complication . A double blind , randomize clinical trial consist 30 patient undergoing colonic surgery , show significant difference postoperative IL-6 , C reactive protein , pain score , bowel function , mobilization , hospital length stay , complication readmission rate two group single 8 mg preoperative dose DXA give interventional group . A recent systematic review meta-analysis 11 moderate quality RCTs suggest decreased postoperative complication hospital length stay patient undergo major abdominal surgery follow preoperative use GC . In case liver resection surgery , Aldrighetti et al find decreased serum ALT , AST , total bilirubin , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , hospital length stay postoperative complication follow single preoperative GC dose . The dominant clinical rationale use preoperative steroid avoid related side effect . A substantial number study document few adverse event MP group compare placebo , suggest need reconsider steroid-free protocol preoperative period . Further appropriately design well-powered study urgently need evaluate effect preoperative GC use . As result , plan prospective RCT University Calgary determine role GC reduce postoperative complication hospital length stay patient undergo partial hepatectomy . Recruitment : Contact information study candidate obtain project 's research staff office four participate surgeon . Patients contact prior surgery research staff provide information regard study . Patients consent participate randomize ( clinic time consent completion operative schedule ) . Data collection : Patients track postoperatively development complication overall length hospital stay . Information collect chart review operative report patient record research staff . Data element collect include , limited : - Date birth , Gender - Surgeon , procedure , surgery duration - Antibiotic prophylaxis - Estimated blood loss , Transfusion - Wound closure technique , peroperative drain , Wound infection disruption - Hepatic failure - Acute kidney injury - Intraperitoneal abscess , surgical site infection - Pneumonia , Blood stream infection , Pulmonary embolism , Deep venous thrombosis - Hypoglycemic incident - Bile leak ( require percutaneous drainage via operatively place drain ) - Anastomotic gastrointestinal leak ( combine colorectal / hepatic resection ) - Preparation type ( ETOH base , chlorhexidine iodine base ) - Time oral intake Patient record : - Preoperative chemotherapy - Preoperative albumin level - Preoperative PVE /or TACE - Underlying liver disease ( cirrhosis ) - ASA score - Length ( ) hepatic inflow occlusion , - Length hospital stay &amp; mortality - Co-morbidities ( smoking , diabetes , hypertension , COPD , Ischemic heart disease , arrhythmia , metastatic cancer , AIDS , obesity , alcohol abuse , psychosis , anemias etc . ) - Glucocorticoids - methylprednisolone give , dose , route administration time start surgery . The investigator also track IL-6 C-Reactive protein ( CRP ) level postoperative day 1 ( daily blood work ) marker global immune function . Definition complication find appendix 2 . Power calculation determine sample size : The large surgical trial date recruit total 73 patient . There 5 small hepatic resection RCTs available analysis ( trial utilize MP ) . The large study note decrease overall complication 54 % 14 % GC use . With consistent volume hepatectomies ( 100+ per year FMC ) , planned inclusion/capture group 's resection nearly 100 % , expect randomize 100 patient arm 2 full year . With alpha = 0.5 , probability = 80 % , predict effect size 0.30 ( 2-tailed test ) , sample size require would 84 patient . Additional comment : Methylprednisolone ( MP ) best choice GC : ( 1 ) 5-fold high anti-inflammatory action compare cortisol , ( 2 ) reduce effect electrolyte , ( 3 ) duration MP biologic action 36 hr ( half life = 2.8 hr ) phase ischemia-reperfusion injury cover , ( 4 ) 500 mg MP result define predictable response &gt; 1 ug/ml blood &gt; 10 ug/ml liver tissue .
