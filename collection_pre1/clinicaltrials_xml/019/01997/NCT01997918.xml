We describe quantify specific patient , donor , treatment , graft outcome characteristic associated course treatment . To assess control bias associate retrospective nature study , emphasize collect clearly state reason decision use haploidentical transplant , e.g . oppose drug therapy second transplant original alternative HLA identical donor .
