	<brief_summary>Tooth loss address different rehabilitative strategy . Implant-supported crowns conventional bridge ( fix dental prosthesis [ FDPs ] ) well establish treatment alternative . Implant therapy sometimes impossible , however , patient-related risk factor economic issue . In case therapy FDP require extensive removal tooth structure provide enough space restoration ensure mechanical retention abutment teeth sound . Alternatives rehabilitation require minor preparation anchor teeth desirable . Resin-bonded bridge meet demand minimal invasiveness use clinically successfully . Sometimes , however , patient choose conventional FDP resin-bonded one ( RBFDP ) esthetic reason since adhesive wing , traditionally make cobalt-chromium alloy , might expose speak smile account colour change abutment teeth . Such patient profit all-ceramic RBFDP . Today , clinical performance metal-based all-ceramic RBFDPs yet evaluate randomize controlled condition . The aim pilot study calculate sample size allow u accept hypothesis metal- all-ceramic RBFDPs similar regard clinical performance adequate statistical power .</brief_summary>
