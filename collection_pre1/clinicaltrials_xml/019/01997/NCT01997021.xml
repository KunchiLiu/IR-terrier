	<brief_summary>Increasing physical activity old adult important implication treat obesity relate metabolic condition , however interaction aging- obesity-related decline physical function may make add structured exercise particularly challenge group . Given challenge , alternative prescription traditional structured exercise , may short bout intermittent walking scatter throughout day - may effective strategy increase physical activity , reduce sedentary behavior , improve glycemic control overweight/obese old adult . The purpose project determine interrupt sedentary time short bout moderate intensity walk affect important metabolic outcome old , overweight adult . It would also interest compare effect short , frequent interruption sedentary behavior traditional exercise prescription ( continuous 30 min walk bout ) metabolic outcome ( e.g. , glycemic control , insulin sensitivity , 24 h fat oxidation ) . Thus , overall aim propose research 1 ) Determine effect perform short bout moderate-intensity intermittent walking ( IW ) glucose insulin metabolism compare uninterrupted sitting ( US ) old overweight obese adult . 2 ) To compare effect interrupt sedentary time ( IW ) vs. traditional exercise prescription ( continuous 30 walk ( CW ) ) metabolism . The investigator hypothesize interrupt sedentary time intermittent walk improve glucose insulin metabolism compare uninterrupted sit effective improve metabolism single continuous 30 min walk .</brief_summary>
