	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one commonly malignant tumor around world cause death 600000~1000000 people year . Since 1990s , hepatic carcinoma become second carcinoma killer China . Surgical resection liver transplantation method possibly able cure hepatic carcinoma . However , due multiple tumor poor hepatic function reserve cirrhosis , surgical treatment suitable small portion patient ( 11.9 % -30.1 % ) . Therefore , clinical practice , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) transarterial embolization ( TAE ) preferential standard treatment unresectable advanced hepatic carcinoma notable advantage control local tumor liver . Hepatic arterial infusion oxaliplatin TACE significantly increase local dos chemotherapeutic agent liver , kill micrometastases residual foci embolization demonstrate outstanding efficacy treat concomitant portal hepatic vein tumor thrombus . S-1 chemotherapeutic agent convenient use definite efficacy , use concomitantly TACE , theoretically effectively control intrahepatic focus also prevent control extrahepatic metastatic focus . However , n't verify clinical application . This study intend investigate efficacy safety combination treatment provide effective safety way treat patient advanced hepatic carcinoma ( Barcelona stage-C patient concomitant portal vein tumor thrombi extrahepatic metastasis ) .</brief_summary>
