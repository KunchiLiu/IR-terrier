	<detailed_description>A total 30 subject least 83 year age recruit use advertisement newspaper , magazine , public place personal contact . After information write ethical consent ( accordance Declaration Helsinki II ) health status evaluate medical doctor include blood screening , screen dementia routine objective evaluation . If reason exclude subject ( see exclusion criterion ) , whole-body DXA-scanned ( Dual X-ray Absorptiometry ) MR-scanned ( Magnetic resonance imaging ) ( dominant knee femur ) functional measure ( 30 chair-stand , 10m 8m gait speed , DEMMI-test ) strength measure ( isometric isokinetic leg power , power rig , grip strength ) tendon stiffness measure . At least 4 day first muscle biopsy dominant m. vastus lateralis take . Hereafter subject randomize one two group : Group one ( n=15 ) exercise nutrition group ( HRT ) . Subjects group conduct supervise center-based heavy resistance exercise lower extremity three time weekly 12 week . As group two , group receive nutritional supplementation twice daily throughout 12 week period . Supplementation contain 20g milk protein carbohydrate lipid . Group two ( n=15 ) nutrition group ( PRO ) . Subjects group receive nutritional supplementation describe . After 12 week intervention strength- functional measure make , DXA- MR-scans second biopsy make along tendon stiffness measurement . Data collect analyzed staff blind randomization . Personal data lock , anonymized data analyze . Differences primary ( m. quadriceps femoris cross sectional area ) secondary outcome ( functional measure , strength measure , muscle cell- fiber type count , mRNA expression , muscle collagen content distribution ) evaluate use two-way anova repeat measure , allow , post-hoc test . Analysis make intention-to-treat . Power : With expect 10 % increase quadriceps CSA ( cross-sectional area ) ( 4500 square mm baseline ) SD 600 square mm , power 82 % alfa 0.05 inclusion 15 subject group . In case systematic health-issues response intervention , trial end immediately .</detailed_description>
