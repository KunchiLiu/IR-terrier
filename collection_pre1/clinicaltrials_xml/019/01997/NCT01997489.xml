	<detailed_description>Fabry disease recessively inherited disorder due systemic storage abnormal metabolite ( ceramide trihexocide , particular ) cause lack lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase . Though X-linked , patient series often equal number male ( hemizygotes ) female ( heterozygote , probably cause mutation one allele inactivation allele X chromosome ) , many clinical feature share ( Cox 2005 ) . Abnormal storage endothelial smooth muscle cell explain morbidity , include shortened life expectancy ( Frost &amp; Tanaka 1966 ; Desnick et al . 1976 ; deVeber et al.1992 ; Hughes &amp; Mehta 2005 ; Nguyen et al . 2005 ; Sodi et al . 2007 ) . This due age dependent ischaemic manifestation affect heart , kidney brain . Angiofibroma early cutaneous manifestation , painful acro-paresthesias express juvenile neuropathy ( Cox 2005 ; Cleary et al . 2005 ) . Cornea verticillata almost obligate ophthalmic finding . The brown-yellow Bowman membrane related corneal deposit teleangiectatic conjunctival vessel early ophthalmic slit-lamp marker disorder ; subtle lens opacity . Fundus vessel tortuosity observe many patient , particular retinal venule , best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) usually normal ( Ballantyne &amp; Michaelson 1970 ; Lou et al . 1970 ; Sher et al . 1979 ; Utsumi et al . 2009 ) . After introduction enzyme substitution therapy 2001 , ophthalmic examination schedule regular part general evaluation Fabry patient Rigshospitalet , Denmark . A 10-year ophthalmic state art part oral presentation Copenhagen conference December 2011 . In contrast common occurrence systemic vascular sequel , one patient series suffer severe visual loss ; unilateral occurred year institution enzyme therapy ( Andersen et al . 1994 ) . In 2013 , however , another young male present similar retinal event . Sporadic case visual loss report literature ( Sher et al . 1978,1979 ; Tuupurainen et al . 1981 ; Sakkuraba et al . 1986 ; Utsumi et al . 2009 ) , large Fabry series ocular vascular catastrophe appear exception rule ( Orssaud et al . 2003 ; Hughes &amp; Mehta 2005 ; Nguyen et al . 2005 ; Sodi et al . 2007 ; Utsumi et al . 2009 ) ) .
