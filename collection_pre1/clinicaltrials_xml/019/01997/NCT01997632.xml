	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate study vaccine , m-IPV2 HD ( vaccine contain polio serotype 2 high dose ) , safe standard IPV Imovax ( contain 3 serotypes polio ) . This safety evaluation do young adult . If study vaccine appear safe , test later stage target group ( infant child ) evaluate immunogenicity vaccine . After , purpose use study vaccine future protect young child Polio serotype 2 . Disease Polio type 2 indeed recently re-appeared , vaccination young child come complete eradication Polio need . The standard use Imovax protect Polio serotype 2 would expensive . Therefore , monovalent Polio vaccine contain serotype 2 ( = vaccine evaluate study ) , develop . The duration study approximately 6 month . 120 subject 18 45 year age participate Belgium . During study 2 group subject . Subjects assign chance one group . One group receive one single injection study vaccine m-IPV2 HD ( contain serotype 2 ) , group receive one single injection standard polio vaccine IPV , Imovax ( contain 3 serotypes ) . After vaccination , follow-up period 6 month . Subjects ask come study centre one time second visit ( Day 8 , 7 day first visit ) . They also receive 2 follow-up phone call approximately one month 6 month vaccination .</brief_summary>
