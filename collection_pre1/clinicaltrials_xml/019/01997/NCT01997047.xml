	<brief_summary>Pneumonia common cause death child worldwide , kill 1.5 million child age 5 year , every year . This number child die AIDS , malaria tuberculosis combine . The current diagnostic management protocol manage serious respiratory disease child 30 year old greatly need update . The successful establishment useful clinical management criterion child respiratory diseases benefit child low resource region around world . The goal study : - To determine child respiratory distress reliably diagnose low-resource condition . - To identify clinical test best differentiate pneumonia wheezy disease . These used establish updated diagnostic criterion common pediatric lung disease broaden current pneumonia algorithm add another wheezy illnesses . - The ultimate objective improve management outcome acute respiratory condition child . - Investigators also wish test efficacy locally develop cell phone oximeter probe low resource setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study organisation . This prospective observational study run simultaneously four Indian public hospital ( King George Medical University , Lucknow ; Regency Hospital , Kanpur ; Vanivilas Hospital , Bangalore ; Bowring Lady Curzon Hospital , Bangalore ) . The study start Oct 2012 cover Indian respiratory viral season . In order maintain high standard data collection , post-graduate research coordinator employ hospital . Because use standardise score system need accurate clinical data collection , member Canadian team spend week centre familiarise local research team member study protocol standardise score system . This follow one week trial period data collection electronic transmission file Canada . Diagnostic definition standardise score . The primary problem facing study pneumonia accurate diagnosis . The overlap clinical radiological finding severe viral infection , asthma bacterial pneumonia make difficult determine febrile tachypneic child wheezy disease one would benefit antibiotic treatment . In many low-resource area , complicate infectious disease , malaria dengue , similar presentation . Early WHO tachypnea-based diagnostic protocol intentionally over-sensitive ensure child bacterial pneumonia receive antibiotic . Later attempt make improve detection wheezy disease , add audible wheeze acute bronchodilator response basic criterion . However , show imprecise , particularly amongst sick child . Investigators choose formalize diagnostic method describe Sachdev et al classified patient four group ( pneumonia , wheezy disease , mixed non-respiratory ) base consultant review detail history examination plus chest radiograph ( CXR ) . Investigators record 29 item protocol include history , examination , CXR oximetry ( see table ) . In order combine result data collection centre , standardise score system conscious level auscultation finding use . For chest radiograph , modification recently update system recommend WHO use . During one week preparatory period , system explain involved ER physician pediatrician use example practice interpretation . Study protocol . All child 5 year age present emergency room study hospital cough difficulty breathe less 5 day , identify . If initial respiratory rate meet WHO criteria pneumonia , study explain native speaker primary language invite enter study . Families pay enrol study cover cost CXR every child plus travel expense outpatient return review day four . After enrolment , twenty nine feature child 's history , examination CXR assess ER physician record study coordinator ( Table 2 ) . After review data , ER physician ask place child one four diagnostic category : pneumonia , wheezy disease ( asthma bronchiolitis ) , mixed ( evidence pneumonia wheeze ) non-respiratory ( malaria , dengue etc ) . The ER physician solely responsible subsequent management decision . All study patient review four day later qualify pediatrician blind ER physician 's CXR interpretation diagnosis . Based review clinical data presentation , plus subsequent course 4 day second examination , pediatrician place patient one four diagnostic category . This consider child 's final diagnosis analysis . Statistical analysis . Logistic regression analysis use determine initial clinical variable best predictive power pneumonia asthma . The best cut-off value continuous variable establish use receiver operate curve analysis . For predictive variable , sensitivity , specificity plus positive negative predictive value calculate conventional table use standard equation . When predictive value combine variable test , investigator link ' A and/or B ' . This increase sensitivity decrease specificity , compare use ' A B . ' Continuous variable display mean +/- one standard deviation . Categorical variable display box whisker plot whisker represent full range . Table investigation perform ER presentation . History Recorded detail Cough yes/no Difficulty Breathing yes/no Lethargy yes/no Reduced feeding yes/no Fever yes/no Previous similar episode number Vaccinations number type Examination Recorded detail Age month Weight weight age ' z ' score Temperature ‚Å∞ Celsius Heart rate beats/minute Respiratory rate breaths/minute Indrawing present/absent Responsiveness score : A fully alert V respond voice P respond pain U unconscious Auscultation score : Chest clear normal vesicular breath sound Crackles coarse fine inspiratory crackles/rattles Wheeze high pitch whistle noise , inspiratory expiratory Crackles wheeze sound present Bronchial breathing tracheal breath sound heard lung Investigations Recorded detail CXR score : one : Normal ) Hyperinflation ) Minor patchy change ) definition , see table 3 Major patchy change ) Lobar change ) Pleural fluid ) Oximetry % oxygen saturation</detailed_description>
