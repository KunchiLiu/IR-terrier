	<brief_title>The Clinical Effects Korean Adapted APD Automated Peritoneal Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well know efficiency peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) vary duration dwell prescribe fill volume . Short dwell ensure adequate UF osmotic gradient maintain prolong dwell allow solute clearance dialysate-to-plasma ratio ( D/P ) uremic toxin creatinine phosphate enhances . In term intraperitoneal fill volume , large fill volume improve removal uremic toxin two reason : large volume drain therefore clearance achieve great , peritoneal surface area available exchange increase . Conversely , small fill volume promote process UF potentially low intraperitoneal pressure ( IPP ) . Overall , choose optimal dwell time exchange volume promote UF increase removal uremic toxins—urea particular—to dialysate . Thus , study propose new way give PD , use modify version conventional prescription firstly use 2 cycle short dwell time small fill volume promote UF subsequently use 2 cycle longer dwell time large fill volume promote removal uremic toxin blood . Although already evaluate efficiency modify prescription Fischbach et al , prescription currently prescribe Korean hospital show difference dwell time , fill volume exchange cycling . The aim study assess clinical effect `` Korean Adapted APD '' ( KAPD-A ) compare `` Korean Conventional APD '' ( KAPD-C ) . This multicenter , randomize , open-label , parallel control study . Patients meet inclusion criterion randomize group ratio 1:1 . For incident patient , stable APD peritonitis-free least 4 week , call `` run-in period '' , group 1 start 8 week KAPD-C treatment cross 8 week treatment KAPD-A group 2 perform contrary KAPD-A KAPD-C treatment . Each patient receive total amount dialysate ( 8000 mL ) , give 8-hour duration . First inclusion visit call `` baseline '' , visit take place every 4 week total 16 week .</detailed_description>
