	<brief_summary>The purpose study , develop standard care protocol use combination EUS , ePFT , sEUS one endoscopic session ( instead three separate endoscopic session ) . The desired outcome diagnose CP establish acceptable protocol perform combine technique . It expect combine procedure eliminate redundant portion procedure , reduce repeat visit hospital , reduce total recovery time patient , decrease associate cost separate procedure . Chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) irreversible , disease pancreas become fibrotic ( thicken scar ) . Symptoms almost always include pain , pancreas becomes progressively fibrosed ( thicken ) , pancreatic hormonal function compromise diarrhea weight loss . However , physician readily diagnose patient severe CP , early CP `` minimal-change '' CP difficult detect , often due lack radiologic finding , laboratory test classic symptom . As result , clinician search diagnostic tool allow earlier , accurate detection disease , hope appropriate therapy initiate extensive thickening scar pancreas occurs . Diagnostic tool evaluate pancreas include Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) , hormone-stimulated endoscopic pancreatic function test ( ePFT ) Secretin stimulate Endoscopic Pancreas Function Test ( sPFT ) use pancreatic fluid ( contain bicarbonate ) obtain duodenum ( part intestine stomach open small bowel ) . EUS increasingly use diagnostic treatment tool pancreatic disease . Currently , hormone-stimulated ePFT consider best way diagnose chronic pancreatitis ( long-lasting inflammation scar pancreas ) , remove need biopsy surgery . It also sensitive detect mild disease . These procedure standard care ( normal care would receive ) evaluation CP . The purpose study , develop standard care protocol use combination EUS , ePFT , sEUS one endoscopic session , instead three separate endoscopic procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Combined EUS , e-PFT sEUS Testing : The endoscopic procedure study perform single endoscopist center . It expect combined EUS , ePFT sEUS complete less 75 minute . Patient sedation accomplish via standard conscious ( Midazolam , Fentanyl and/or Meperidine ) sedation monitor ( Propofol ) sedation per study investigator America Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ASGE ) American Society Anesthesiology ( ASA ) guideline . A mechanical-radial EUS echoendoscope color Doppler assessment capability pass via standard technique pancreas examine gastric duodenal station . Representative EUS image record digital videotape/digital snapshot head , body tail per CRF . See Appendix B . These image become part patient 's electronic medical record . The echoendoscope use measure specific parenchymal ( hyperechoic focus shadowing , hyperechoic strand shadow , lobular contour , cyst , calculus ) ductal ( main ductal diameter , irregularity , hyperechoic margin , stone presence visible side branch ) abnormality . It expect evaluation complete approximately 10 minute . Prior secretin administration ( baseline MPD diameter ) , pancreatic duct diameter measure head , body , tail use endosonographic caliper . The investigator provide initial assessment presence absence chronic pancreatitis prior secretin administration . Next , echoendoscope use aspirate gastric duodenal lumen dry . The gastric duodenal sample discard . Once gastric duodenal lumen aspirate dry , patient give test dose human secretin 0.2 mcg ( 0.1mL ) indwelling catheter peripheral vein ass possible allergic response . Patients monitor time evaluation hemodynamic instability . If one minute evidence allergic reaction , remain full dose secretin 0.2 mcg/kg IV give one minute . Beginning time 4 minute completion secretin intravenous infusion , pancreatic duct diameter measure head , body , tail use endosonographic caliper . Measurements pancreatic duct occur sequentially 4 , 8 , 12 minute follow conclusion secretin administration . Representative image also obtain measurement time point . The echoendoscope use measure specific parenchymal ( hyperechoic focus shadowing , hyperechoic strand shadow , lobular contour , cyst , calculus ) ductal abnormality . The investigator perform follow-up assessment chronic pancreatitis use additional data post-secretin administration . The ePFT portion examination commence . The echoendoscope remove forward-viewing gastroscope place stomach . Stomach content aspirate dry . The forward-viewing gastroscope place across pylorus distal duodenum . Beginning time 15 minute follow completion secretin infusion , duodenal sample ( 5-10 mL ) collect suction channel echoendoscope . The sample collect standard endoscopic collection container place ice . At time 30 45 minute completion secretin administation , sample obtain similar fashion place separate container ice . The procedure complete patient bring day recovery suite . At conclusion procedure , sample bring immediately hospital chemistry laboratory evaluate bicarbonate concentration use hospital autoanalyzer frozen -70 degree Celsius analysis delayed . Using autoanalyzer technique generally require three-fold dilution fluid content . The high bicarbonate concentration 3 sample consider peak concentration . The diagnostic cut-off pancreatic exocrine disease set &lt; 80 mEq/L ( 80 mEq/L great indicate normal function ) . Patient participation study complete time completion combine function test . A telephone call occur PI designee patient within 3-7 day study drug administration serve follow-up complete CRF .</detailed_description>
