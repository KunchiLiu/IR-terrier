	<brief_title>DBS Under General Anesthesia : Comparison To The Standard Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) establish therapy Parkinson 's disease tremor . The therapy first introduce late 1980s , FDA approve 1997 . Over 100,000 patient treated DBS , benefit confirm multicenter randomize controlled trial . Traditional DBS perform patient awake . Parkinson 's patient require Parkinson 's medicine awake DBS , single-unit cellular recording perform map intend target . Electrophysiological mapping require multiple brain penetration . The surgery last 4-6 hour . The surgeon use local anesthetic numb tissue incision make , mild sedative administer ward anxiety . The prospect awake operate table brain surgery concern patient , requirement medicine . There grow interest perform DBS general anesthesia , whereby target select anatomically ( i.e. , MRI ) rather physiologically . So-called `` asleep DBS '' perform patient general anesthesia , use intraoperative CT image target verify accurate placement DBS electrodes time surgery . Asleep DBS eliminate need patient kept awake medicine . The goal Asleep DBS accurately place electrode target select surgeon preoperatively , goal accomplish intraoperative imaging . Electrophysiological mapping perform . The Asleep DBS program Barrow Neurological Institute / SJHMC start March 2012 ; second institution world-wide adopt asleep technique develop Dr. Kim Burchiel . Other institution perform asleep DBS within MRI magnet visualize placement electrode . The `` Burchiel technique '' relies upon MRI-CT fusion algorithm superimpose lead , see CT , MRI use planning . While asleep DBS improve patient experience , incumbent upon u demonstrate functional outcome equivalent report traditional `` awake '' DBS . Further , despite common use MRI-CT fusion , available neuronavigation system , evidence support modality come 1990s , primarily Gamma Knife literature . This study include functional outcome use establish metric Parkinson 's , capture motor function ( Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ) quality life ( Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire-39 ) . In addition , follow-up MRI imaging allow u verify true position DBS lead match think lead base intraoperative CT scan fuse preoperative MRI . In word , error placement see time surgery ( inaccuracy 2 mm , reposition DBS lead ) . There also inherent inaccuracy CT-MRI fusion . If inaccuracy compound think time surgery far actually ( see follow-up MRI brain ) , CT-MRI fusion reliable use verify lead placement .</detailed_description>
