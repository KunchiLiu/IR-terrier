Recurrent hospitalization frequently due significant part lack viable therapeutic option severe HF . During hospital admission , medication drip give vein ( intravenous therapy ) , require improve heart pump capacity ( milrinone ) .They frequently use many case prolong treatment period intravenous therapy require . In grow number case , need continue treatment home , however particularly costly often complicate intravenous line infection . As expand need therapeutic option patient advanced HF . Over 20 year ago , study potential utility rapid release form oral milrinone examine , however study demonstrate adverse effect due quick release . This study aim determine safety tolerability slow release oral milrinone advance HF patient clinical option evaluate effect HF status .</brief_summary>
