	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) one lead cause serious , life-long disability among adolescent young adult . Especially cognitive , emotional , motor deficit cause TBI often impair everyday psychosocial functioning , quality life ( QoL ) ability work dramatically , thereby bring lot suffer burden patient family well substantial social economic cost society . Early rehabilitation highly important restore lose skill function , often difficult give severity extent TBI symptom high strain available rehabilitation method put patient . Music therapy highly motivate , versatile , applicable form TBI rehabilitation , currently little scientific evidence efficacy mechanism TBI population . The purpose present project determine long-term effect Music-based Neurological Rehabilitation ( MBNR ) cognitive , motor , emotional , social recovery TBI adolescent young adult , study neural mechanism underlie behavioural recovery efficacy music . The study single-blind , cross-over randomize control trial ( RCT ) involve 60 adolescent young adult subacute moderate / severe TBI . During 18-month follow-up , patient receive MBNR ( 30 session , 3 x week , 1 hour session ) and/or Standard Care ( SC ) . The MBNR intervention utilizes structure cognitive-motor training drum creative musical expression ( music playing , song write ) piano gear towards engage train attention , executive function , work memory , upper-extremity function enhance emotional self-expression , adjustment , mood TBI . The SC consist type conventional rehabilitation ( e.g. , physical therapy , neuropsychological rehabilitation ) medical care TBI provide private public health care . Half patient receive MBNR intervention first 10-week period half second 10-week period ( addition , patient receive SC whole follow-up period ) . Outcome measure comprise neuropsychological test ( measure executive function , attention , reason , work memory learn ) , neurological scale ( measure neurological symptom , functional outcome , adjustment , participation ) , motor test ( measure motor dexterity , coordination , upper limb functioning ) , structural functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI/fMRI , measure gray white matter structure integrity auditory-motor neural processing ) perform start study ( baseline ) , first 10-week period ( 3-month stage ) second 10-week period ( 6-month stage ) . At time point well 12 month later ( 18-month stage ) , patient caregiver also give questionnaire measure executive function , depression symptom , quality life , caregiver well-being burden .</detailed_description>
