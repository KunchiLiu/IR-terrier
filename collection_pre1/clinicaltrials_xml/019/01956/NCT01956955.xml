	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction 1.1 . Background Acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) common often fatal disease , approximately 30 % mortality rate without treatment [ 1 ] . Treatment important reduce mortality recurrence acute pulmonary embolism . Anticoagulation mainstay therapy acute PE . It decrease mortality rate 3 8 percent , effective therapy institute quickly possible [ 2 , 3 ] . In case , therapeutic option include subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin ( SC LMWH ) , intravenous unfractionated heparin ( IV UFH ) , subcutaneous unfractionated heparin subcutaneous fondaparinux without thrombolysis [ 3 ] . In treatment acute PE , SC LMWH least effective safe IV UFH [ 4 ] . In general , compare IV UFH , SC LMWH associate low mortality , few recurrent thrombotic event less major bleed [ 5 ] . Current guideline recommend use SC LMWH haemodynamically stable patient PE say SC LMWH test set hypotension shock [ 3 , 6 ] . However , seem feasible use advantage easy administration route , i.e . SC . We use SC LMWHs case acute PE without requirement thrombolysis clinical practice since available , advantage practical use use primary secondary care setting patient PE suspicion admission hospital . In 10 year ' clinical experience , observe comparable hemorrhage risk ( 3.7 % vs 0.7 % 12.1 % vs 3.8 % , major minor hemorrhage risk , respectively ) use LMWH plus thrombolysis case massive PE , even compare case treat LMWH alone without massive PE ( 7 ) . Yet , head head study compare LMWH UFH treatment massive PE . The study evaluate safety LMWH use thrombolytic treatment management acute PE . 1.2 . Purpose The purpose study , practical use need monitoring , demonstrate SC LMWH , enoxaparin , safe alternative IV UFH management acute PE case , require thrombolytic treatment , combination thrombolytic treatment . 2 . Study Objectives 2.1 . Primary aim The primary aim study compare major hemorrhage risk use LMWH plus thrombolytic treatment UFH plus thrombolytic treatment acute massive PE . 2.2 . Secondary Aim The secondary aim study compare minor hemorrhage risk mortality ( five day one year mortality ) use LMWH plus thrombolytic treatment UFH plus thrombolytic treatment acute massive PE . 3 . Investigational plan 3.1 . Study design This single-center randomized study acute PE patient require thrombolytic treatment contraindication use anticoagulation , compare safety SC LMWH versus IV UFH use thrombolytic treatment . After baseline evaluation diagnostic procedure provide informed consent , eligible patient diagnose acute PE require thrombolytic treatment contraindication use study drug include alteplase , LMWH ( enoxaparin ) heparin include study . 3.2 . Study set A tertiary care , university , hospital , big hospital eastern part Turkey serve 7 city . 3.3 . Study period Between January 2011 December 2013 3.4 . Rationale study design LMWHs use treatment PE use become popular many center practical administration route , SC versus infusion , need monitor close follow . However , previous data use LMWHs case require thrombolytic , reason , recommendation use current guideline . Because case administer LMWH admission hospital thrombolytic treatment require immediate administration thrombolytic treatment , use thrombolytic likely although recommendation use . Because adverse event associate use LMWH thrombolytic treatment case require thrombolytic comparable even case use LMWH alone require thrombolytic ( 7 ) , plan compare LMWH UFH case require thrombolytic treatment latter choice case accord current guideline . This study provide data compare safety LMWH versus UFH treatment acute PE case require thrombolytic treatment . The randomized study select make head head comparison evaluate safety LMWH versus UFH treatment acute PE case require thrombolytic treatment . No stratification apply randomization . 3.5 . Randomization method The randomization order determine use computer-generated list random number . 3.6 . Ethical consideration Local ethical committee approve protocol study . 4 . Population 4.1 . Study population : The study population consist approximately 120 adult case clinical diagnosis acute PE require thrombolytic treatment contraindication use anticoagulation single center , tertiary university hospital . It anticipate approximately 150 patient need screen order randomize 2 treatment arm study randomization ratio 1:1 ; therefore , approximately 60 patient assigned treatment group . 4.3 . Screening eligibility All patient clinical suspicion PE ( major risk factor , clinical manifestation ) underwent chest X-ray , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , echocardiographic evaluation computerize thorax ( CT ) angiography 16-slice multidetector CT ( contraindication ) . 4.4 . Inclusion criterion : Key inclusion criterion patient must fulfill eligible study include : - Adults , age ≥ 18 year - Patients sign study inform consent form prior initiation study-related procedure . - Acute massive PE patient require thrombolytic treatment . 4.5 . Exclusion criterion Patients fulfil follow criterion eligible inclusion study . No additional exclusion may apply investigator , order ensure study population representative eligible patient . - Patients contraindication use anticoagulation thrombolysis , active bleeding , stroke , cranial trauma , neurologic surgery within precede 6 month , current pregnancy , major surgery , biopsy within precede 7 day , major trauma within precede 10 day , gastrointestinal bleeding within precede 1 month admission . - Patients receive anticoagulation medication prior admission hospital . 5 . Treatment 5.1 . Investigational control treatment ( Exposure ) Investigational treatment : LMWH , enoxaparin , plus alteplase Control treatment : UFH plus alteplase 5.2 . Treatment arm After provide informed consent , patient assign 1 follow 2 treatment arm ratio 1:1 . - Fixed dose SC LMWH ( enoxaparin ) - Weight adjust dose UFH . In treatment arm , patient also receive thrombolytic treatment , bolus 10 mg alteplase follow 90 mg 2-h infusion . 5.3 . Treatment monitoring After thrombolytic treatment , bolus 10 mg alteplase follow 90 mg 2-h infusion , patient either administered constant heparin infusion ( 18 U/Kg per hour ) adjust maintain activate partial thromboplastin time 46-70 SC LMWH receive enoxaparin . After fibrinolytic therapy ( FT ) , 4-6 hour later , activate partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) check . According initial SC LMWH use time , fix dose SC LMWH , enoxaparin , administer subcutaneous every 12 hour . Both group overlap warfarin 1st day 5th day day achieve targeted international normalize ratio ( INR ) level . The patient keep warfarin , aim INR 2.0 3.0 3 month , depend presence major risk factor . 5.4 . Schedule measurements The clinical evaluation ( physical exam , blood pressure , pulse rate &amp; oxygen saturation ) perform start fibrinolytic treatment . The echocardiographic examination interpretation perform start fibrinolytic treatment . 5 . 5 . Data collection follow-up Data collection perform admission , hospitalization discharge . At least year-follow plan . 6 . Definitions 6.1 . Adverse Events Major hemorrhage ; stroke ( confirm compute tomography ) , hematoma &gt; 5 cm , oral gastrointestinal bleeding another bleeding concomitant hypotension require treatment intravenous fluid , blood transfusion , surgical control , discontinuation FT regimen , decrease &gt; 15 % point hematocrit &gt; 5 g/dl reduction hemoglobin [ 9 ] . Minor hemorrhage ; decrease 10-15 % point hematocrit 3-5 g/dl reduction hemoglobin [ 9 ] . Mortality : Hospital mortality day 5 one year mortality . 6.2 . Other definition Massive PE ; define acute PE sustain hypotension ( systolic arterial pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg drop systolic arterial pressure least 40 mm Hg least 15 minute ) cardiogenic shock ( include alter level consciousness , oliguria , cool , clammy extremity ) [ 8 ] . Recurrent PE ; clinical suspicion new PE symptom , new sign electrocardiogram in-hospital without clinical instability , death . 7 . Statistical Analysis Plan 7.1 . Sample size power : 120 acute massive PE patient . We &gt; 80 % power ( 2-sided test significance level &lt; 0.05 ) detect 20 % absolute bleeding risk increase . 7.2 . Statistical method Statistical analysis perform SPSS Windows version 17.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , USA ) . Data express percent , mean standard deviation , odds ratio 95 % confident interval . We use two-tailed Student test comparison continuous variable patient SC LMWH plus thrombolytic UFH plus thrombolytic Pearson Chi square test comparison categorical variable . Survival estimation do Kaplan-Meier Survival Probability estimate Cox regression . Findings consider statistically significant P value &lt; 0.05 obtain .</detailed_description>
