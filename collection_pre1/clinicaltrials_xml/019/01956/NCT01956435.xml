	<brief_title>Excimer Light Treatment Idiopathic Guttate Hypomelanosis : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : This pilot study consist 10 adult subject symmetric IGH low leg . After enrollment , 5 lesion IGH leg select either Dr. Jennifer Gordon Dr. Ammar Ahmed mark . Subjects randomize extremity ( right left ) treat . Treatments Xtrac Excimer laser ( wavelength 308nm ) perform twice weekly 12 week use typical vitiligo protocol ( see Appendix C ) . Photographs extremities take prior initial treatment every 4 week . The photographs analyze two separate , blinded dermatologist rat improvement baseline use follow scale : 1= worsen IGH ; 2= improvement ( IGH remain stable ) ; 3= mild improvement IGH ( repigmentation &lt; 50 % IGH ) ; 4= moderate improvement ( repigmentation &gt; 50 % full repigmentation &lt; 75 % IGH ) ; 5= full repigmentation &gt; 75 % IGH ( see Appendix A ) . Subjects also ask complete survey subjectively every 4 week . Internal control represent marked lesion non-treated extremity patient . Control versus treatment group statistically compare ; however , due limit number patient pilot study , descriptive trend analysis likely complete . Subjects compensate $ 10 per visit ( total $ 250 ) . If subject withdraw early study , compensate every complete visit . The 25th visit consist final photograph survey , include treatment . Statistical Analysis : The main outcome collect improvement IGH baseline week 4 , 8 12 blinded dermatologist subject . Subjects stratify Fitzpatrick skin type analysis well .</detailed_description>
