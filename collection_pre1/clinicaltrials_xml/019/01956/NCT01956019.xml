	<brief_summary>This study use diffusion weight MRI ( DWI MRI ) dynamic-contrast enhance MRI ( DCE MRI ) techniques detect change sarcoma tumour vasculature . The main aim study correlate histological response soft tissue sarcoma pre-operative radiotherapy several pre-treatment DCE DWI MRI parameter assess impact early response prediction . Detected change may reflect sensitivity tumour radiotherapy may associate long term outcomes treatment . 15 patient normally pre-operative radiotherapy part sarcoma treatment recruit study . Patients additional three specialise MRI scan : one prior start radiotherapy , one second week radiotherapy treatment one scan week surgery completion radiotherapy . Post-operatively , result histological examination sarcoma correlate MRI scan data outcome treatment</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis intermediate/high grade soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) Patients must suitable treatment preoperative radiotherapy radical surgery Standard radiological assessment ( CT MRI ) may already perform must do within 4 week start radiotherapy Patient must measurable disease CT/MRI image ECOG performance status 02 Adequate pretreatment haematological biochemical parameter Age great equal 18 year No significant comorbidity thereby exclude patient radical treatment . No previous treatment diagnosis STS include neoadjuvant chemotherapy Women child bear age MUST negative pregnancy test prior study entry use adequate contraception method unless child bear potential terminate surgery/radical radiotherapy Patients must give write informed consent Patients cardiac pacemaker , cochlear implant , intraocular foreign body MRI incompatibility factor ( e.g . recent surgery ) . Patients known history anaphylactic reaction contrast material MRI Previous administration gadoxetic acid contrast material 24hr prior MRI Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , view investigator , make undesirable patient participate trial Evidence significant clinical disorder laboratory finding , opinion investigator make undesirable patient participate trial Any serious uncontrolled medical condition Clinical evidence metastatic disease Any pregnant lactate woman Any patient medical psychiatric condition impairs ability give inform consent Evidence impair renal function , serum creatinine &gt; 1.5x upper limit normal</criteria>
