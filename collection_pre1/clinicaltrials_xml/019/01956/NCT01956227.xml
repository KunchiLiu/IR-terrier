	<detailed_description>Falls serious health concern person multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Over 50 % person MS suffer fall 6-month periodwith majority fall result medical attention injury ( i.e. , laceration , bone fracture , &amp; head injury ) . The effect fall often compounded lead activity curtailment , physiological deconditioning , institutionalization . Despite importance fall person MS , appropriate prevention strategy ( i.e . rehabilitation approach ) clear . It well know cause fall multifactorial 400 risk factor identify . However , believe factor divide two main class : intrinsic ( e.g . physiological factor ) extrinsic factor . For instance balance dysfunction , spasticity muscle weakness physiological risk factor fall MS . Behavioral fall risk factor MS include choose appropriate footwear , light utilizing appropriate assistive device . There evidence type risk factor minimize appropriately design intervention person MS show reduce fall risk incidence clinical population . This lead call combination exercise train program target specific , modifiable physiological risk factor educational intervention target modifiable behavioral risk factor person MS . However , minimal evidence intervention isolation combination actually reduce fall incidence risk person MS . This proposal seek determine effectiveness combine exercise educational rehabilitation strategy prevent fall person MS .</detailed_description>
