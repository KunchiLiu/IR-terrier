	<detailed_description>1 . Ethical consideration : - The study conduct accordance requirement express Declaration Helsinki ( Hong Kong revision , September 1989 ) follow recommendation Good Clinical Practice Clinical Trials ( document 111/3976/88 , July 1990 ) Spanish legislation ( Royal Decree 561/1993 , publish April 16th Official State Bulletin `` BOE '' ; May 13th , 1993 ) laying requirement conduct clinical drug trial . - Every subject receive write document call `` Patient Information Sheet '' contain information follow aspect clinical trial : ) Aim study , methodology , study treatment alternative therapy , expect benefit society , risk study possible adverse event , number visit additional test . b ) Voluntary nature participation ability withdraw time , without thereby alter doctor-patient relationship . c ) People access data volunteer maintain confidentiality data . ) How contact investigator necessary . - The investigator obtain informed consent subject , failing , legal representative . The subject preferably express write consent , alternatively , orally research team independent witness declare write responsibility . - The person participate clinical trial representative may revoke consent time . 2 . Data Access : - In order ensure confidentiality trial data , access , researcher team , test monitor Clinical Research Ethics Committee correspond center purpose test relevant health authority . - Protection data : The content data collection form document generate study , protect unauthorized us people outside research , therefore , consider strictly confidential disclose third party except specify precede paragraph . 3 . Data Collection : - Data colection form date signed authorize principal investigator . - Unknown data collect `` NA '' ( available ) . - Unusual extreme result , match expect sequence check corrected initialing , sign provide explanation . - Laboratory result exceed normal limit establish laboratory center , check researcher significance note next data , initial signing . 4 . Statistical Analysis : - Baseline data analyze use descriptive statistic demographic ( mean , median , standard deviation , minimum , maximum , number valid case ) quantitative variable absolute relative frequency categorical variable . - The primary efficacy objective determine response rate graft versus host disease ( confidence interval 95 % ) . - The primary safety objective determine incidence adverse event toxicity relate administration CSM ( confidence interval 95 % ) . - Secondary objective : analyze overall survival disease-free survival Kaplan-Meier method .</detailed_description>
