	<brief_summary>This study investigate treatment protocol hold potential significantly improve communication quality life individual affect Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Disorders emotional communication widely report PD negatively impact quality life increase social isolation decrease independence . Individuals emotional prosodic communication disorder often perceive depressed unconcerned others . This seem negativity cause difficulty relationship , increase feeling stress burden caregiver may result early placement institutional care set . This innovative treatment program could improve care individual PD , well individual may affect disorder emotional prosodic communication ( e.g. , stroke traumatic brain injury ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) present variety motor symptom include rest tremor , difficulty initiate movement/slowed movement , rigidity . While motor sign symptom hallmark feature , individual PD also often demonstrate change communication ability , estimate prevalence 89 percent individual PD affect . These disorder communication report individual PD caregiver one difficult aspects live disorder . The commonly diagnosed communicative disorder PD hypokinetic dysarthria result change prosody , respiratory control , voice quality , articulation . Of , disorder prosody judged prominent deficit . Prosody include pitch , loudness , rate speech utterance produce used communicate emotional connotation ( e.g . angry versus sad ) . Impairments speech prosody reduce ability communicate emotional feeling intention well reduce intelligibility speak message . While pharmacological treatment show effective improve motor function , medication show greatly mitigate speech production disorder include prosody , suggest therapy dopaminergic agent need address prosody deficits PD . Despite negative impact quality life reduce independence individual affect emotional prosodic disorder , publish study available test therapy improve production emotional prosody PD . The primary goal proposal compare treatment protocol show effective treat emotional prosodic deficit stroke TBI ( Leon et al. , 2005 ; Rosenbek et al. , 2006 ) standard clinical treatment prosody deficit target emotional aspect disorder individual PD . The experimental treatment target increase pitch loudness variability , control speech rate , core characteristic prosodic insufficiency PD , emphasis emotional component disorder . The primary aim study determine treatment effect size measure difference experimental protocol versus standard clinical care prosodic deficit individual PD via change acoustic perceptual measure , well provide psychometric validation test-retest reliability outcome measure .</detailed_description>
