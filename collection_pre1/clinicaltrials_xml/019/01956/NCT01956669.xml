	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good bad , pazopanib ( GW786034 ) , National Service Center ( NSC ) # 737754 , child , adolescent young adult 12 month less equal 18 year age relapse refractory rhabdomyosarcoma , non rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcoma , Ewing sarcoma , relapse refractory osteosarcoma , neuroblastoma ( measurable and/or evaluable ) , hepatoblastoma . This two-stage open label phase II trial pazopanib child , adolescent young adult recurrent refractory solid tumor . Eligible subject receive pazopanib daily oral tablet ( 450 mg/m^2/dose ) powder suspension ( 225 mg/m^2/dose ) 28 day cycle . The maximum dose administer daily tablet 800 mg suspension 400 mg . Subjects closely monitored clinical laboratory observation side effect . Response treatment evaluate use appropriate imaging study . In absence severe toxicity progressive disease , subject may continue receive pazopanib .</brief_summary>
