	<brief_summary>Because Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma ( PCNSL ) mainly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma activate B cell ( ABC ) type , investigator hypothesize synergy lenalidomide rituximab show systemic non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) could observe PCNSL . This study assess efficiency combination lenalidomide rituximab relapsed/refractory PCNSL , efficiency maintenance treatment lenalidomide alone maintain response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Lenalidomide With Rituximab Refractory Relapse Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator use two-stage Fleming 's design base following hypothesis treatment : 10 % ( null hypothesis , minimal clinical benefit rate ) , 30 % ( alternative hypothesis , acceptable clinical benefit rate ) , 3 % type I error rate , 5 % type II error rate . Under hypothesis , total 45 assessable patient necessary : 22 first stage + 23 second stage . Stage 1 : follow inclusion first 22 assessable patient , 0 1 patient objective response ( CR , Complete Response + uCR , unconfirmed Complete Response + PR , Partial Response ) end induction treatment , study would terminate early treatment consider ineffective . If 2 patient objective response end induction treatment , treatment consider effective indication . Otherwise , second group 23 patient recruit . Stage 2 : end recruitment , 8 less patient objective response , investigator conclude inefficacy , 9 patient objective response , treatment consider effective need exploration .</detailed_description>
