	<brief_summary>In study , investigator try see LMP specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) prevent treat disease call Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) Disorder include either Hodgkin Lymphoma non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Lymphoepithelioma severe chronic active EBV infection syndrome ( SCAEBV ) Leiomyosarcoma come back go away treatment , include best treatment . Investigators use special immune system cell call third party LMP specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , new experimental therapy . Some patient Lymphoma SCAEBV Leiomyosarcoma show evidence infection virus cause infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) time diagnosis . EBV find cancer cell half patient Hodgkin 's non-Hodgkin Lymphoma , suggest may play role cause Lymphoma . The cancer cell ( lymphoma ) B cell ( SCAEBV ) infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape destruction . The investigator want see special white blood cell , call T cell , train kill EBV infected cell survive patient 's blood affect tumor infection . Investigators use sort therapy treat different type cancer occur bone marrow solid organ transplant call post transplant lymphoma . In type cancer tumor cell 9 protein make EBV surface . They grow T cell laboratory recognize 9 protein able successfully prevent treat post transplant lymphoma . However Hodgkin Lymphoma , tumor cell B cell express 2 EBV protein . In previous study make T cell recognize 9 protein give patient Hodgkin Lymphoma . Some patient partial response therapy patient complete response . They think one reason may many T cell react protein tumor cell . In present study investigator try find investigator improve treatment grow T cell recognize protein express EBV infect Lymphoma cell B cell call LMP-1 LMP2 . These special T cell call third party LMP 1/2 -specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( CTLs ) . These LMP-specific cytotoxic T cell investigational product approve Food Drug Administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators first test biopsy tumor lymph node already do see tumor tissue cell EBV positive . If patient eligible , investigator take 60 mL ( 12 teaspoon ) blood patient donor one two occasion . They use blood grow T cell . First grow special type cell call dendritic cell monocytes stimulate T cell . Next put specially produce human virus carry LMP gene dendritic cell monocyte . They use stimulate T cell . This stimulation train T cell kill cell LMP surface . Investigators grow LMP specific CTLs stimulation EBV infect cell . These EBV infect cell treat radiation grow . Once sufficient number T cell make , investigator test make sure kill cell LMP surface . If count low may need obtain additional blood sample make cell . Prior give patient CTLs , cell test make sure n't attack tissue . The cell thaw injected patient 10 minute . Initially , two dos T cell give two week apart . If second infusion reduction size lymphoma CT MRI scan assess radiologist , patient receive six additional dos T cell patient wish . This dose escalation study mean patient second dose may large first . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Methodist Hospital . For follow-up CTL infusion , patient see every 3 month first year . Then patient either see clinic contact research nurse yearly 5 year .</detailed_description>
