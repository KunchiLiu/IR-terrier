	<brief_title>Association Kisspeptin Levels With Insulin Secretion Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Since discovery kisspeptin `` gate-keeper '' hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis , tremendous interest molecule . Kisspeptins group peptides derive kiss gene , share common C-terminal decapeptide arginine-phenylalanine residue amino terminal . ( 1 , 2 ) These peptide target receptor GPR54 highly express hypothalamus , anterior pituitary , islet langerhans , gonad . ( 2-5 ) The relevance kisspeptin regulatory molecule reproductive system well document significant number trial . ( 6 , 7 ) This lead possibility kisspeptin could involve equally pivotal role site , locate , namely pancreas . Investigators demonstrate kisspeptin play role regulate beta cell activity . ( 8 ) Despite previous conflict result suggest glucose mediate insulin secretion insulin inhibition different study , ( 9 , 10 ) current evidence favour role kisspeptin glucose mediate insulin secretion . ( 11 ) One early evidence relation insulin resistance fall kisspeptin level demonstrate Panidis et al 2006 . While various animal experiment suggest kisspeptins regulate insulin secretion , know also true human . The investigator hypothesize kisspeptin level significantly low individual low endogenous insulin secretion . Thus investigator plan study understand link endogenous insulin secretion kisspeptin level among individual various level insulin secretory defect see diabetic . We believe help understand physiologic mechanism , kisspeptin base insulin regulation among individual diabetes mellitus . Researchers also note mechanism stimulate glucose induced insulin release , similar GLP1 ( Glucagon like peptide ) action . ( 10 ) It would interest ascertain correlation two peptide potentially similar action insulin physiology . Leptin show alter kiss-1 expression animal model . Establishing link leptin level kisspeptin human would help u identify potential therapeutic target involve multisystem manifestation diabetes . ( 12 ) AIMS AND OBJECTIVES : 1 : To explore association level fast insulin kisspeptin level , diabetes mellitus . 2 . To explore association Obesity Kisspeptin level . 3 . To explore association kisspeptin GLP-1 level . 4 . To explore association leptin kisspeptin level . RESEARCH QUESTION : In population adult attend outpatient diabetes medicine clinic tertiary care hospital , Do diabetes mellitus compare without diabetes mellitus , progressively low kisspeptin level , gradient Kisspeptin level relate fast endogenous insulin secretion . Investigators hypothesize low Kisspeptin level associate low insulin secretion . STUDY TYPE- STUDY DESIGN : Cross-sectional study Ethical approval trial protocol obtain institute 's ethic committee Care Hospital , Nagpur , India Subjects Methods The study conduct CARE Hospital , Nagpur 1 September 2013- 31 November 2013 . Patients select enter study , way every patient present diabetes medicine clinic screen study patient fulfil inclusion criterion recruit study . Study population : Total 60 patient include study . Investigators plan include Diabetics without exogenous insulin supplementation , Diabetics exogenous insulin supplementation normal healthy cohort , 20 group . Methods : The investigator screen patient refer fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion study . Written inform consent obtain participant . The patient include study administer standardized questionnaire record socio-demographic characteristic , detail diabetes management , history PCOD ( Polycystic Ovarian Disease ) , history hypogonadism obvious sexual dysfunction drug history . A general examination BMI ( Body mass index ) , waist hip ratio Blood pressure would perform . Blood sample withdraw ( 8 ml : 2ml fluoride tube , 2ml EDTA ( ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ) , 4 ml plain tube ) overnight fast creatinine , fast blood glucose , fast insulin , C-peptide level , HbA1C ( glycosylated haemoglobin ) , LH ( luteinizing hormone ) , FSH ( Follicle stimulate hormone ) , kisspeptin level . In female patient sample collect day 3 day 6 normal menstrual cycle . After usual meal regularly take patient , sample ( 8ml : 2ml fluoride , 4ml EDTA 2 ml plain tube ) post-prandial blood glucose level , insulin level , leptin level , GLP-1 level kisspeptin level collect . The blood sample creatinine , glucose ( pre post ) , insulin level , HbA1C , LH FSH analyse immediately laboratory . The blood sample kisspeptin level , GLP-1 , leptin level collect separate EDTA tube , centrifuge 15 min 4 degree plasma store separately deep freezer -70 degree . The concentration kisspeptin measure use KissÂ¬peptin-10 ( Metastin [ 45-54 ] -Amide ) competitive enzyme immunoassay ( Kit # EK-048-56 , Phoenix Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , Burlingame , CA , USA ) . Leptin ( Human ) ELISA Kit Protocol ( Cat . No . : EK-003-12 , Phoenix Pharmaceuticals ) use serum leptin level . GLP-1 ( 7-36 ) -Amide ( Human , Rat , Mouse ) EIA ( enzymeimmunoassay ) Kit ( Catalog # EK-028-11 , Phoenix Pharmaceuticals ) use test GLP 1 level . The method give product insert use assay . Power analysis There similar study do help u predict power study . As investigator previous estimate formal power calculation undertaken . The investigator randomly decide take 60 patient study , 20 arm . Data analysis All data enter use MS excel . Researchers perform descriptive statistical analysis baseline data . The analyst , blind laboratory result , compare outcome measure use Pearsons coefficient correlation . All statistical analysis do use SPSS software ( v.16.0 SPSS , Inc. , Chicago , IL ) Dissemination The result trial expect provide evidence clinically relevant information relation kisspeptin diabetes . Risks participation The investigator believe additional risk participant include study . Competing interest The author declare compete interest .</detailed_description>
