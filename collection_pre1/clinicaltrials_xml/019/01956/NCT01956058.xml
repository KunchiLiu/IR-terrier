	<brief_summary>After curative treatment radiotherapy localize prostate cancer , 20 % 50 % patient may biological relapse progressive -rise PSA . After prostate brachytherapy low flow , rate 2 % 6 % . Depending risk factor initially present , patient micro metastatic disease time re-rise , others true local recurrence purely intra-prostate . Local recurrence radiotherapy associate high incidence distant metastatic relapse poor overall survival . For reason , possibility offer local treatment select population patient major therapeutic interest allow change situation often consider palliative possibility second curative treatment . Currently , consensus regard optimal management patient purely local recurrence prostate irradiation first intention . When external radiotherapy brachytherapy perform first choice patient prostate cancer , several remedial treatment propose , controversial result decision-making clinician difficult patient . These main therapeutic option remedial ( surgery , cryotherapy brachytherapy ) potential complication rectal injury , impotence incontinence Brachytherapy new salvage treatment evaluate United States ( Phase II study Radiation Therapy Oncology Group No . 0526 ) . Several retrospective trial show encouraging result term acute toxicity biochemical control short term . Thus , team Mount Sinai New York recently publish first time 10 year retrospective result approach . In experience treatment failures external beam radiotherapy brachytherapy , dose 122 Gy deliver 90 % prostate gland . Doing observed biochemical control rate survival specific 54 % 96 % , respectively 10 year , hormone treatment associate ( median 6 month ) 84 % case . Four patient grade 3 toxicity high ( 11 % ) . To reduce rate late toxicity team University Of California San Francisco ( UCSF ) , test focal brachytherapy guide functional MRI ( MRI spectroscopy ) re-treat local recurrence initial brachytherapy monotherapy boost . By deliver 144 Gy recidivism objectify MRI , author observe minimal dose 37Gy cover 90 % prostate gland treat risk microscopic disease . Doing , rate observe toxicity biochemical control appear encouraging , median follow-up 2 year , since grade 3 toxicity observe 74 % patient achieve PSA nadir &lt; 0.5 ng / mL without associate hormone . In case external radiation brachytherapy , several attempt propose associate injection hyaluronic acid gel prostate - rectum interface spare healthy tissue irradiate thus reduce rate radiation proctitis . The feasibility implement gel demonstrate patient non- irradiated tissue . No inherent toxicity injection hyaluronic acid gel describe prostate brachytherapy first line . The feasibility injection remain unproven date patient previously irradiate externally brachytherapy . We hypothesize risk radiation proctitis fistula front prostate could reduce use technique indication . We propose carry French prospective multicenter phase II trial combine brachytherapy remedial injection hyaluronic acid surgery reduce risk radiation proctitis / recto -urinary fistula patient population hyper- select high probability isolate local recurrence .</brief_summary>
