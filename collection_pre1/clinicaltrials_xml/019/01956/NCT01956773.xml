	<brief_summary>The outcome research demonstration family health history ( FHH ) risk data use efficiently deliver effective healthcare geographically ethnically diverse clinical care environment . Although FHH standard component medical interview widespread adoption hinder three major barrier : ( 1 ) dearth standard collection method ; ( 2 ) absence health care provider access complete FHH information ; ( 3 ) need clinical guidance interpretation use FHH . In addition , time constraint busy provider poor integration FHH paper medical record electronic medical record ( EMR ) impede widespread use . The investigator hypothesize patient-driven electronic collection FHH risk stratification promote inform decision-making patient provider , improve adherence risk-stratified preventive care guideline . The study team use implementation science approach integrate innovative FHH system collect FHH patient . Intermountain Healthcare provide information technology expertise EMR design develop innovative solution storage model standard FHH data well centralize standards-compliant open clinical decision support ( OpenCDS ) rule development architecture analyze FHH generate evidence-based , individualized , disease risk , preventive care recommendation patient provider .</brief_summary>
