	<brief_summary>The feasibility study involve mixed method , mean interview well assessment treatment inspiratory muscle training therapy ( IMT ) . There two pathway within study depend whether people want inspiratory muscle training . People accept inspiratory muscle training assessment training , 8 week train 6 month follow addition interview study ( 6 month ) . For choose inspiratory muscle training investigator offer interview investigator find might make study appeal treatment would prefer . The investigator also ask wish follow baseline assessment study period investigator access health record . Interviews Semi-structured interview last approximately hour perform begin study participant accept IMT pathway decline IMT know theme raise . These interview use provide information reason decline pulmonary rehabilitation , attitude exercise , attitude IMT , treatment preference opinion regard study design outcome measure ( see Interview Topic guide ) . The interview tap transcribed verbatim . A follow interview study participant receive IMT conduct 6 month address attitude IMT study design whether decide wish engage service ( pulmonary rehabilitation smoke cessation ) . Inspiratory Muscle Training ( IMT ) method Participants perform 8 week IMT strength training use Powerbreathe Kinetic device ( Powerbreathe ) . Training progress 60 % maximum inspiratory pressure ( PiMax ) . This mean breath device set 60 % maximum force able create breathe rather full force . 30 breath perform high velocity ( pace initially period 15 minute allow recovery breath device ) . Once establish anticipated training session take five minute . Training performed twice day , 5 day per week first 8 week . Training titrate ( set level suitable participant ) supervise weekly first 8 week physiotherapist . After 8 week train participant advise continue training unsupervised , twice day , 3 time per week 18 week .</brief_summary>
