	<detailed_description>Both strength training endurance exercise training commonly prescribe improve strength function patient physical limitation cause chronic disease disability include chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Individuals CKD often low physical function due progressive decline performance kidney . The low physical function lead physical inactivity , exacerbate functional decline promote cardiovascular disease bone disorder . In addition , severe functional limitation patient prevent exercise great enough intensity provide significant benefit . As result , alternative strategy need maximize benefit exercise decrease injury risk . A new form exercise , functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) -enhanced cycle show increase muscle size strength patient severe disability , particularly spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . It base application electrical stimulation nerve innervate paralyze weak muscle order generate muscle contraction . FES use stimulate leg muscle pedal cycle enable partial weight-supported walking activity base rehabilitation therapy . FES cycle involves exercise use motor-assisted cycle couple electrical stimulation five muscle leg . There well-documented benefit FES-induced exercise SCI patient include clinically significant increase muscle mass , blood flow , bone density , bowel bladder function . A pilot study also demonstrate FES therapy potential improve function disabled population , include chronic heart failure stroke patient . However , effect population significant physical impairment , include CKD patient , yet establish . The objective propose research evaluate effect FES-cycling training measure related physical function , quality life ( QOL ) , heart disease , bone health patient renal failure receive dialysis therapy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Age 3185 year 2 . Must receive hemodialysis treatment least 3 day per week 3 . Must willing randomize control FEScycle group 4 . Must receive medical clearance Nephrologist dialysis clinic participate 5 . Must evidence impair mobility FES Screening Form , attach . The FES Screening Form inclusion criterion consist questionnaire five task relative difficulty scale completion task . Participants include study indicate `` '' difficulty task questionnaire . 1 . On dialysis treatment le 3 month . 2 . Body weight great 400 pound . ( weight limitation DXA table ) 3 . Unstable angina , recent ( less 3 month ) myocardial infarction stroke ( condition may enable patient tolerate propose exercise training ) . 4 . Implanted electronic pace defibrillation device , vagus nerve stimulator , unstable vital sign . ( safety electrical stimulation condition know ) . 5 . Metal implant underneath near muscle group stimulate . 6 . Pregnancy ( safety stimulation pregnancy know ) section ICD create woman initial indicate NOT pregnant plan become pregnant course study . 7 . Lower limb amputation . On PARQ form , participant answer YES question : `` Has doctor ever say heart condition physical activity recommend doctor ? `` , exclude study . We also use answer Medical History Form help u evaluate exclusion criterion . Answers follow question either exclusionary , require followup physician prior allow participate : Question 1 : `` Do ever get chest pain rest and/or exertion ? `` , Question 4 : `` â€¦was heart attack within last year ? '' An answer YES either question require individual obtain comprehensive physical exam physician prior allow participate . Question 10 : Has physician ever specifically tell `` heavy '' `` hard '' exercise ? An answer YES require physical exam . Under `` Medical History '' ( top page 2 Medical History Form ) , `` Present Symptoms Review '' ( top page 3 ) check `` chest pain pressure '' require physical exam . Under `` Present Symptoms Review ( top page 3 ) , check follow lead exclusion : Implanted electronic pace defibrillation device ; vagus nerve stimulator ; metal implant legs ; unstable vital sign .</criteria>
