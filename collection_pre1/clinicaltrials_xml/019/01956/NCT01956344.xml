	<brief_summary>The purpose research measure change brain activity functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) cognitive-behavioral therapy compulsive hoarding . Cognitive-behavioral therapy aim help people change thought behavior maintain symptom hoard . The investigator intend enroll approximately 80 people hoard disorder 40 people psychiatric disorder , age 20 60 , study . The investigator believe treatment change brain activity individual compulsive hoarding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long-term goal propose research improve clinical outcome Hoarding Disorder ( HD ) , common potentially debilitating condition pose severe public health burden . The PI develop test cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) appear moderately effective , although clear room improvement . In present study , investigator propose merge line research PI 's recent NIH-supported neuroimaging research point specific functional abnormality region interest ( ROIs ) relate cognitive affective decisionmaking process . Patients HD n = 80 ) randomize CBT wait list ( WL ) . At pre-treatment , mid-treatment , post-treatment , patient undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) acquire discard decision-making task use successfully investigator ' previous work . In addition , patient complete number laboratory task design assess decision-making capacity impairment . A group healthy control ( HC ) participant ( n = 40 ) also complete measure normative control group . The primary aim propose study determine extent observe patterns neural activity HD change follow CBT . Under aim , investigator predict HD patient ( vs.HCs ) show great hemodynamic activity ROIs associate cognitive affective aspect decision-making . The investigator predict HD patient receive CBT ( vs. WL ) show decreased activity ROIs , long differ HCs follow CBT . A secondary aim propose study determine relationship change activity brain region interest hoarding-related symptom impairment . The investigator expect , hemodynamic activity target ROIs correlate symptom HD performance decision-making task ; change brain activity correspond symptom mechanism change course treatment . Finally , exploratory aim explore , use data-driven model-constrained approach , pattern pre-treatment neural activity predict response CBT . The investigator predict among treated HD patient , pre-treatment activity target ROIs correlate significantly HD symptom change pre- posttreatment . Results propose study expect elucidate neural mechanism successful response CBT treatment hoard patient , set stage treatment development possible improvement outcome disorder .</detailed_description>
