	<brief_summary>Oral cancer represent sixth common cancer worldwide whilst Pakistan rank second common cancer either gender . Histologically , 90 % oral cancer lesion squamous cell carcinoma diagnose basis histopathological analysis . However , proliferation kinetics nucleolar status clearly delineate routine H &amp; E examination ; thus make use various proliferation marker imperative purpose . Nuclear organizer region ( AgNORs ) associate proliferative activity represent diagnostic aid oral malignancy . Similarly , methyl green pyronin ( MGP ) stain also valuable complement routine histopathological study several neoplastic entity . Morphometric technique offer opportunity quantify nuclear change associate malignancy may provide objective basis grade tumor . The present study plan analyze morphometric parameter MGP stain oral squamous cell carcinoma , various histological grade , ass MGP stain parameter could give information aggressiveness malignant lesion oral cavity . Sections thirty case squamous cell carcinoma along thirty case normal oral mucosa evaluate methyl green pyronin ( MGP ) AgNOR stain . Morphometric analysis various MGP stain AgNOR parameter would perform use micrometer . Statistical analysis result carry use SPSS . Quantitative variable express mean Â± Standard Deviation . Frequencies percentages give qualitative variable . It hypothesize oral squamous cell carcinoma exhibit significantly high MGP stain AgNOR stain parameter normal mucosa oral cavity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oral cancer , major global health problem hold sixth position worldwide mark variation geographic distribution . It rank third frequent cancer develop world stomach cervical cancer . Amongst oral cancer , oral squamous cell carcinoma account 90 % case . Out develop county , Indo-Pak subcontinent amount one third global oral cancer burden . Carcinoma oral cavity Pakistan , one high-risk country second frequent cancer either gender . With differential distribution among sub-populations , represent 8.8 % report cancer case . The predominant risk factor include tobacco smoking , betel chew alcohol . Screening specific diagnostic tool two innovative approach early detection oral cancer . Conventional oral examination clinical evaluation remain foundation screen approach whereas surgical biopsy follow histological analysis attribute gold standard diagnose malignant oral lesion . Furthermore , adjunctive technique may contribute diagnosis oral cancer . Of vital staining , DNA analysis , chemiluminescence , tissue fluorescence , light-based detection system biomarkers forefront . Biomarkers valuable reveal additional information tumor pathology , include inactivation tumor suppressor gene , angiogenesis , apoptosis cell proliferation . Aberrations proliferation kinetics imperative factor tumor progression . Three main category cell proliferation marker include growth fraction marker like Ki67 , cycle-specific marker like PCNA ( Proliferating Cellular Nuclear Antigen ) , cell cycle time marker like AgNOR . During malignancy , proliferation protein synthesis mainly control nucleus . Nucleolar Organizer Regions ( NORs ) loop DNA short arm acrocentric chromosome presumably associate cell proliferation . Some NOR associate protein argyrophilic demonstrate black dot silver stain technique structure thus demonstrate known AgNORs . The AgNOR quantitative parameter provide information velocity cell proliferation cell cycle . Neoplastic progression affect rate cell proliferation , rather proliferative activity per se . Although AgNOR stain AgNOR quantification valuable method histopathological evaluation malignancy , certain limitation also associate technique . Such AgNOR associate shortcoming include nucleolar affinity silver stain obscure individual AgNORs case intense staining , overlap variable degree high low grade tumor , difficulty discern doublet cluster light microscopy , misinterpret stain deposition proliferative activity along technical problem stain fixation . Methyl Green Pyronin ( MGP ) stain differential stain use selective stain DNA RNA . Methyl green bind specifically deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) , stain nucleus green , pyronin specific ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , stain nucleoli red . Methyl green pyronin stain also use distinguish proliferating dedifferentiate non-proliferating cell nucleus . Similarly assess degradation DNA thyroid follicular epithelial cell , stain also proven useful . Morphometry significant advancement delineate sequence event responsible cancer progression . Variations nuclear cellular size shape great implication assessment neoplastic lesion . Methyl Green Pyronin ( MGP ) stain attract attention recent time use evaluate various nuclear morphometric parameter breast neoplasm . By use methyl green-pyronin staining , inadequacy associate AgNOR staining lessen also morphometric parameter evaluate change nucleus nucleolus carcinogenesis accomplish . So far AgNOR stain appear useful diagnostic tool oral squamous cell carcinoma examination nucleolar structure variation nucleolar activity . On hand , MGP stain use assess cancerous lesion breast thyroid gland recently extend oral lesion . However , study undertake yet evaluate compare morphometric parameter use two stain within normal oral epithelium oral squamous cell carcinoma . Similarly , study undertake regard application methyl green pyronin stain oral pathology . Hence current study plan evaluate morphometric parameter among normal oral epithelium oral squamous cell carcinoma use methyl green pyronin staining ; moreover finding also compare AgNOR stain . In current scenario , methyl green pyronin stain morphometric analysis may go hand hand provide good diagnosis early detection oral cancer .</detailed_description>
