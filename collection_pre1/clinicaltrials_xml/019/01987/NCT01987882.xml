	<brief_title>Cerebral Palsy Hip Outcomes Project - International Multi-centre Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Children severe cerebral palsy ( CP ) high risk dislocate hip . These hip associate contracture pain , interfere care-giving , seating , positioning , mobility quality life . The primary purpose project ( Aim 2 ) evaluate effectiveness different intervention strategy prevent relieve symptom associate hip instability child severe non-ambulatory CP , use validate Caregiver Priorities Child Health Index Life Disabilities ( CPCHILD© ) questionnaire primary outcome measure health relate quality life ( HRQL ) population . Secondarily , project also measure impact hip displacement HRQL child . This project first kind scale , systematically study impact hip instability management child severe CP , use meaningful outcome measure develop specifically purpose . The international network investigators/sites infrastructure establish project facilitate long term follow-up participant study , well conduct multi-centre clinical trial cohort study evaluate effectiveness current future intervention aim improve quality life child severe disability . Study Design &amp; Participants : International multi-centre prospective longitudinal cohort study child severe ( non-ambulant ) cerebral palsy ( GMFCS level IV &amp; V ) age 3 18 radiographic evidence hip displacement [ Reimer 's Migration Percentage ( MP ) ≥ 30 % ] . Measures : Detailed demographic information , prognostic factor , include co-morbid condition record baseline , addition self-administered parental report HRQL measure CPCHILD . Hip status classify use standardized radiographic measure Reimer 's MP acetabular index ( AI ) . The primary outcome measure CPCHILD , well MP &amp; AI measure 6 , 12 24 month follow initial intervention . Aim 1 : Measure impact increase hip displacement child severe ( non-ambulant ) CP HRQL measure CPCHILD questionnaire . Aim 2 : ( Primary Purpose ) : Measure effectiveness different strategy intervention hip displacement child severe ( non-ambulant ) CP prospective longitudinal comparative cohort study use CPCHILD primary outcome measure HRQL . Aim 3 : Compare type rate adverse event complication associate treatment cohort . Methods : Observational study usual ( site/surgeon specific ) clinical practice . Investigators site enroll eligible participant assign one follow 5 cohort base individual treat doctor 's &amp; /or parental preference : A . `` Natural '' history watchful waiting ( N=100 ) B . Serial botulinum toxin injection +/- abduction bracing ( N=100 ) C. Adductor ( +/- psoas ) muscle release alone ( N=100 ) D. Hip reconstructive surgery ( N=100 ) E. Salvage hip surgery ( N=100 ) The baseline MP CPCHILD score participant analyze cross-sectionally evaluate correlation hip displacement CPCHILD score serve Aim 1 . For Aim 2 , child undergo intervention hip instability ( Groups B , C , D , &amp; E ) compare well respective match counterpart untreated child ( Group A ) , use repeat measure analysis covariance ( ANOCOVA ) measure mean change score baseline 6 , 12 24 month intervention . Timelines : 500 participant recruit 24 month , follow 24 month . The analysis , report result , manuscript development knowledge transfer take 12 month . In total , study take 5 year complete .</detailed_description>
