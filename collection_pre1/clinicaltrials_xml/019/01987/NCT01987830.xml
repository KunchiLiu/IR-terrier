	<brief_summary>This research study explore blood vessel participant 's tumor change treatment bevacizumab , change affect way tumor absorbs temozolomide ( TMZ ) . The pilot part study evaluate use [ 11C ] temozolomide PET ( TMZ-PET ) scan MRI scan tell investigator standard treatment bevacizumab affect blood vessel participant 's tumor , change affect way participant 's tumor absorb temozolomide . `` Investigational '' mean role TMZ-PET scan still study research doctor try find . Bevacizumab approve U.S. Food Drug Administration use people participant 's type cancer . It work block signal specific protein call vascular endothelial growth hormone ( VEGF ) , play role promote growth spread tumor blood vessel . Bevacizumab `` anti-VEGF ' agent design slow growth participant 's cancer . Since anti-VEGF agent also affect normal blood vessel brain , inhibit way drug use combination bevacizumab deliver tumor . Researchers look bevacizumab affect delivery chemotherapy , case temozolomide . In PET scan , radioactive substance inject body . The scan machine find radioactive substance , tend go cancer cell . For PET scan research study , investigator use radioactive substance call [ 11C ] temozolomide , chemically identical prescription drug TMZ . TMZ FDA approve chemotherapeutic agent cancer [ 11C ] temozolomide investigational agent . In research study , participant receive standard treatment bevacizumab oral temozolomide well standard MRI scan . In addition , participant undergo TMZ-PET scan treatment bevacizumab . The first TMZ-PET scan occur 7-13 day start treatment oral temozolomide begin treatment bevacizumab , day 1 start treatment bevacizumab 1 month start bevacizumab . TMZ-PET scan give time vascular MRI , evaluate change tumor blood flow , blood volume , receptive blood vessel also measure much TMZ brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before research start ( screen ) : After sign consent form , participant ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn participant take part research study . If participant test procedure recently , may may repeat . - A medical history , include question participant 's health , current medication , allergy . - Physical Exam include measure participant 's height , weight , vital sign - Performance status , evaluate participant able carry usual activity . - Blood test . - Blood pregnancy test woman childbearing potential - Urine test . If test show participant eligible participate research study , participant begin study treatment . If participant meet eligibility criterion , participant able participate research study . After screen procedure confirm participant eligible participate research study : Please note study add additional treatment participant type cancer . There change treatment bevacizumab daily temozolomide base result procedure test carry part study . Before set scan participant follow test procedure : - Routine blood test check participant 's overall health - Creatinine clearance blood test check proper kidney function - Blood pregnancy test woman childbearing potential After participant take oral TMZ 7-13 day , participant : - An assessment tumor DCE-MRI ( Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) scan PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scan MRI-PET Scan Procedure : The participant scan perform Charlestown , MA Martinos Center . The participant inject two separate intravenous ( IV ) line : - [ 11C ] temozolomide PET scan contrast dye MRI scan - Drawing blood ass radioactivity [ 11C ] temozolomide [ 11C ] temozolomide PET Scans ( TMZ PET Scan ) : - The PET scan take approximately 90 minute . The participant receive one injection [ 11C ] temozolomide . Following injection radioactive substance , blood sample take second IV line . MRI Scan : - MRI scan last 60-75 minute . This occur time PET scan . The participant inject contrast dye twice MRI scan . The MR-PET scan ( ) perform Day 1 initiation bevacizumab ( Day 15 initiation temozolomide ) Day 30 inititiation bevacizumab ( Day 45 initiation temozolomide ) . Blood sample collect scan order measure blood vessel process radiotracer [ 11C ] temozolomide well delivered tumor tissue . Blood sample draw 2.5 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 75 , 90 minute [ 11C ] temozolomide injection . The participant assess side effect via clinic visit phone call 24 hour visit . - Planned Follow-up : The investigator would like call participant every 3 month three year second MR-PET scan see participant experience side effect . If participant remove study due unacceptable side effect , participant follow resolve .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must histologically confirm glioblastoma evidence recurrence &gt; 2 month since last cycle temozolomide . Patients lowgrade tumor progress glioblastoma eligible . Patients must receive least 6 month monthly temozolomide previously . Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 10 mm . See section 10 evaluation measureable disease . Only patient neurooncologist plan give bevacizumab temozolomide 50mg/m2/day part treatment eligible study Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use radiolabeled temozolomide participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric trial . Life expectancy great 3 month . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 ( see Appendix A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mcL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal . Patient must able undergo MRI PET scan . Patients must maintain stable corticosteroid regimen 5 day prior MRPET scan . The effect radiolabed temozolomide develop human fetus unknown . For reason radiopharmaceutical agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition temozolomide . Participants already receive antiVEGF experimental antiangiogenic therapy glioblastoma . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study radiolabeled temozolomide radiopharmaceutical agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother radiopharmaceutical agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treated radiopharmaceutical agent . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction radiolabeled temozolomide . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patients suitable undergo MRI use gadolinium contrast due : Claustrophobia Presence metallic object implant medical device body ( i.e . cardiac pacemaker , aneurysm clip , surgical clip , prosthesis , artificial heart , valve steel part , metal fragment , shrapnel , tattoo near eye , steel implant ) Sickle cell disease Renal failure Reduced renal function , determine creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min base serum creatinine level obtain within 28 day prior registration</criteria>
