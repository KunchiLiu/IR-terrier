	<brief_summary>Dendritic cell key component inflammatory response see psoriasis . Several current psoriasis therapy show reduce number dendritic cell patient psoriasis , lead researcher believe therapy specifically target dendritic cell may lead improvement psoriasis . Research recently conduct Dr. Gallo 's lab University California San Diego show transgenic mouse overexpressing enzyme hyaluronidase significant decrease number dendritic cell dermal component skin compare wild type mouse . If hyaluronidase overexpression human also decrease number dendritic cell dermis , hyaluronidase therapy may improve clinical presentation psoriasis . In order test hypothesis , recombinant human hyaluronidase ( Hylenex® ) inject subcutaneously psoriatic plaque human psoriasis patient every week total 4 week . Each week clinical appearance plaque document . At final visit skin biopsy treat plaque take visualize histology plaque look change expression different inflammatory marker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participation study consist total 5 visit UCSD Dermatology Clinic approximately one-month period . At first visit , two psoriatic plaque 2-cm 5-cm diameter study trial agree upon patient well blind unblinded investigator . Preference give plaque elbow since elbow common place psoriatic plaque , since scar elbow usually acceptable scar part skin since skin elbow naturally hyperpigmented people . For remainder study , grade measurement psoriatic plaque complete blind investigator unaware plaque receive treatment . An unblinded investigator complete portion study visit , include digital photography , inject plaque , complete biopsy . The subject also blind plaque inject treatment . During first 4 visit , plaque inject 1-mL Hylenex® 1-mL sterile ( pharmaceutical grade ) normal saline ( NS ) . 1-mL Hylenex® contain 150 Units recombinant hyaluronidase . This standard dose drug approve FDA , therefore dose consider safe use adult . If inject subcutaneously center psoriatic plaque 2 5 centimeter diameter , 1-mL dose able diffuse throughout entire area beneath plaque . The exact pharmacokinetics Hylenex® difficult study due rapid inactivation intravenous injection . According Hylenex® package insert , though , disruption dermal barrier occur response subcutaneous Hylenex® injection persist 24 hour injection , barrier completely restore 48 hour . Cutaneous dendritic cell reside epidermis think migrate away epidermis either lymphatic vascular channel Hylenex® inject . This process take hour . Since cutaneous dendritic cell think turnover every several week , new dendritic cell populate epidermis patient receive next injection Hylenex® . Since dendritic cell activation initiate inflammatory cascade think result psoriasis , prevent dendritic cell harbor epidermis essentially prevent inflammatory cascade result psoriasis . Therefore , month-long period patient receive Hylenex® injection , inflammatory cascade trigger psoriasis potentially turn , allow affected plaque heal without propagation psoriasis . If true , difference Hylenex®-treated versus NS-treated plaque morphologically histologically upon completion final set biopsy Visit 5 .</detailed_description>
