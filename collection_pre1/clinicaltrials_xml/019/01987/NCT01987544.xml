	<brief_summary>Home ergometer training combine online monitoring regular telephone support could prove cost-effective method improve physical performance quality life COPD patient . The primary objective study demonstrate significantly high daily workout time patient monitor home ergometer train telephone support compare conventional home ergometer training . Consequently expect increase quality life relate illness decrease BODE-Index . A post-interventional low BODE-Index correlate reduce risk hospitalisation mortality .</brief_summary>
