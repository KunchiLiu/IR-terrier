	<brief_summary>APD356-A001-402 multicenter , double-blind , randomize , parallel-group pilot study 12-week duration overweight obese adult . Approximately 225 subject randomize one three treatment arm ratio 1:1:1 receive combination lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily ( BID ) plus immediate-release phentermine-HCl 15 mg BID 15 mg daily ( QD ) , lorcaserin alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter , Double-blind , Randomized , Parallel-group , Pilot Study 12-week Duration Assess Short-term Safety Tolerability Lorcaserin Plus Two Doses Immediate-Release Phentermine-HCl Compared With Lorcaserin Alone Overweight Obese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject take lorcaserin phentermine-HCl/placebo morning mid-afternoon . The dosing time help reduce potential insomnia due phentermine . Subjects Arm A take one tablet twice daily lorcaserin 10 mg combination one capsule twice daily phentermine placebo . Subjects Arm B take one tablet twice daily lorcaserin 10 mg , one capsule phentermine-HCl 15 mg daily morning , one capsule phentermine placebo daily mid-afternoon . Subjects Arm C take one tablet twice daily lorcaserin 10 mg combination one capsule twice daily phentermine-HCl 15 mg . Subjects instruct take lorcaserin tablet phentermine/placebo capsule concurrently attempt remain consistent daily schedule . The study recruit obese ( body mass index [ BMI ] great equal 30 kg/m2 ) subject without weight-related comorbid condition ( e.g. , hypertension , dyslipidemia , sleep apnea ) overweight ( BMI great equal 27 29.9 kg/m2 ) subject least one weight-related co-morbid condition . At least one third subject BMI 40 kg/m2 great , high likelihood combination therapy use subject medical practice . A lifestyle intervention program , use 12-week adaptation Arena Healthy Lifestyles Program , include diet exercise counseling , implement obesity/overweight . Blood sample perform evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) lorcaserin phentermine use population PK model well potential relationship exposure lorcaserin/phentermine measure safety change baseline body weight , use population PK/PD ( pharmacodynamics ) modeling .</detailed_description>
