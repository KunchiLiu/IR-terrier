	<brief_summary>The goal propose study explore feasibility use PID ( Proportional-Integral-Derivative ) controller versus MPC ( Model Predictive Control ) controller algorithm artificial pancreas system , component study design equal . The study consist evaluation either type control algorithm part Artificial Pancreas ( AP ) device two period 27.5-hour closed-loop control clinic environment ( Sansum Diabetes Research Institute , Santa Barbara , CA ) separate minimum 5 day maximum 2 week . The 27.5-hour period include : 2 announce meal ( dinner breakfast 65g 50g CHO respectively ) precede dose rapid-acting insulin equivalent 100 % bolus base subject 's Insulin Carbohydrate ( I : C ) ratio 1 unannounced meal ( lunch 65g carbohydrate , meal content dinner ) ; complete night 12:00 7:00 . The goal demonstrate AP device able maintain subject blood glucose within safe range time .</brief_summary>

Age 21 65 year For female , currently know pregnant nursing HbA1c 5 10 % , measure DCA2000 equivalent device Willing perform calibration study CGMs use finger stick willing follow instruction insulin pump CGM wear . Willing use study CGM study insulin pump closedloop . Able agrees avoid follow medication start 24 hour sensor wear completion close loop study visit : acetaminophen , prednisone , pseudoephedrine . An understanding willingness follow protocol sign inform consent . Exhibit hypoglycemia unawareness . Indications cardiac arrhythmia . Pregnancy ( determine positive blood pregnancy test perform female childbearing capacity screen visit urine test time admission inpatient visit ) nursing mother . Females sexually active able conceive use contraception . Diabetic ketoacidosis past 6 month prior enrollment require emergency room visit hospitalization Severe hypoglycemia result seizure loss consciousness 12 month prior enrollment Current treatment seizure disorder ; Subjects history seizure may include study receive write clearance neurologist Active infection A known medical condition judgment investigator might interfere completion protocol cognitive deficit . Mental incapacity , unwillingness language barrier preclude adequate understanding cooperation , include subject able read write . Coronary artery disease heart failure . Subjects history coronary artery disease may include study receive write clearance cardiologist Presence know adrenal disorder Active gastroparesis If antihypertensive , thyroid , antidepressant lipid lower medication , lack stability medication past 2 month prior enrollment study Uncontrolled thyroid disease ; Adequately treat thyroid disease celiac disease exclude subject enrollment Abuse alcohol Current use beta blocker medication Laboratory result : 1 . Hematocrit &lt; 30 % &gt; 55 % 2 . A1C &gt; 10 % 3 . Abnormal liver renal function ( Transaminase &gt; 2 time upper limit normal , Creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ) 4 . Labs drawn screen visit within one month prior screen ( purpose ) suffice enrollment purpose related hematocrit Subject skin condition , determination investigator , would preclude wear study device ( infusion set sensor ) , abdomen . Examples include limited : psoriasis , burn , scar , eczema , tattoo , significant hypertrophy site device wear ; know allergy medical adhesive . Currently longterm treatment use prednisone . If subject short term treatment prednisone , defer enrollment underlying condition prednisone treatment resolve . Allergy study drug , food study material . Clinically significant screening ECG , physical examination , laboratory test , vital sign abnormality . Exposure investigational drug within 30 day . History malignancy within 5 year screen ( basal cell carcinoma ) . Currently smoke discontinue smoking ( include cigarette , cigar , pipe ) past 6 month . Current participation another investigational trial .</criteria>
