	<brief_title>T-cell And General Immune Response Seasonal Influenza Vaccine ( SLVP018 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan study immune response different influenza vaccine much broadly deeply across different age group different vaccine modality probe influence genetics response use monozygotic dizygotic twin . The investigator plan compare various immunological response , identify age-specific biomarkers cluster marker , quantify frequency influenza-specific T-cells pre- post-vaccination , determine effective breadth T-cell repertoire influenza vaccine within individual function age degree genetically determine . This work may help improve design new vaccine , influenza respiratory pathogen well .</detailed_description>
