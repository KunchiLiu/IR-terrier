	<brief_title>Multi-Center Study To Examine The Use Of Flex HD® And Strattice In The Repair Of Large Abdominal Wall Hernias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At least 100,000 ventral hernia repair perform U.S. year . Recently , biologically-based implant derive acellular human dermis , porcine small intestinal submucosa , porcine dermis report variety complex abdominal wall repair procedure . A variety surgical technique implant placement method describe , one standard technique achieve precedence . Biologic implant reinforcement myofascial closure mean component separation , minimum , three-layer fascial approximation possible , sublay placement ( i.e. , closure posterior rectus sheath implant ) describe strategy . These technique allow placement implant intact fascial layer may improve implant incorporation host tissue . However , current literature show , , prospective , randomize , head-to-head comparison human acellular dermal matrix ( HADM ) allograft porcine acellular dermal matrix ( PADM ) xenograft use reinforce material repair large abdominal hernia component separation technique . The Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation ( MTF ) manufacture process Flex HD Acellular Hydrated Dermis . This acellular dermis derive human skin . In complicated ventral hernia repair , type graft tissue necessary . Flex HD show reduce operative time , low operative cost provide minimal elasticity . The primary objective study examine compare outcomes associate use Flex HD® , human acellular dermal matrix ( HADM ) , Strattice™ , porcine acellular dermal matrix , ( PADM ) use reinforce material repair large complicate abdominal wall hernia .</detailed_description>
