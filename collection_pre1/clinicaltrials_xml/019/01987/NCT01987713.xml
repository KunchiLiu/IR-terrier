	<brief_summary>Methods : This study three-year mixed method study , include identification obesity issue among child chronic condition first phase study ( 2013/10/01-2014/07/31 ) , development intervention protocol second phase study ( 2014/08/01-2015/07/31 ) , conduction/evaluation intervention lifestyle intervention third phase study ( 2015/08/01-2016/07/31 ) . Firstly , anthropometry , healthy lifestyle questionnaire survey child age 7-12 school environment audit conduct . By use literature review , meta-analysis focus-research approach develop healthy lifestyle intervention protocol second year program . The protocol test sample school-age child asthma , develop school-based family-involved healthy lifestyle intervention . Finally , protocol undertaken child asthma age 10-15 , use experimental ( pretest-posttest ) design repeat follow-up . The research subject randomly assign condition receive intervention control ; measurement outcome across 4 observation , assess group difference ( experimental comparison ) , change within group . The intervention consist healthy diet ( X1 ) , regular exercise ( X2 ) , booster energy balance-related behavior ( BEBRB ) ( X3 ) . The observation start baseline ( O1 ) , three observation ( O2 , O3 , O4 ) 3-month interval respectively . Outcome indicator include height , body weight , waist circumference well healthy life style modification present diet record , exercise diary , healthy life environment . The research subject consist randomly sample school-age child father ( mother ) , school teacher school nurse . The approximate sample size estimate power analysis dropout rate , eligible sample size 200 160 pair child parent , school teacher nurse first third year respectively .</brief_summary>
