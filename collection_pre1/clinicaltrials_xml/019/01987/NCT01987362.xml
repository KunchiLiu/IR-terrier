	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 , non-randomized , dose-escalating , open label , multi-center study conduct two part ( Part A Part B ) . RO6870810 small molecule , non-covalent inhibitor bromodomain extra-terminal ( BET ) family bromodomains . This study design characterize safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics anti-tumor activity RO6870810 participant histologically confirm solid tumor progressive disease ( PD ) refractory intolerant standard/approved therapy . In Part A , RO6870810 administer subcutaneous ( SC ) injection daily either 21 consecutive day 28-day cycle 14 consecutive day 21-day treatment cycle participant advance solid tumor malignancy determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . In Part B , RO6870810 administer dose MTD characterize safety profile biological effect subset participant advance solid tumor malignancy . It anticipate total 84 participant enrol study ( 54 Part A 30 Part B ) . In addition , expect 20 participant histologically confirm nuclear protein testis ( NUT ) -midline carcinoma ( NMC ) progressive disease require therapy enrol sub-study Parts A B . In addition , 20 participant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) may enrol select study site .</brief_summary>
