	<brief_title>Allograft Reconstruction Massive Rotator Cuff Tears vs Partial Repair Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 30 patient enrol study . Subjects randomize two arm , either ( 1 ) Partial Repair/Debridement ( 2 ) Allograft Reconstruction . The patient complete structure clinical examination conduct sport medicine fellowship train orthopaedic consultant , Pre-operatively Post-operatively 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month .

The main benefit procedure patient currently irreparable massive , chronic rotator cuff tear may acquire mean cuff repair . This may aid improve function shoulder , restore ability complete activity daily live , decrease pain sleep disturbance . This would allow participant become functional rehabilitation . It belief study could provide new information help understand relationship , would turn lead future study area orthopaedic surgery .</detailed_description>
