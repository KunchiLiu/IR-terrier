	<brief_summary>Evaluate effect bronchodilator therapy respiratory function . Our overall goal determine whether , patient familial dysautonomia ( FD ) , component airway obstruction reversible . To end , evaluate airway resistance receive anti-cholinergic ipratropium ( Atrovent ® ) beta-2-agonist albuterol ( ProVentil®/Ventolin® ) . We predict response either drug depend underlie level sympathetic parasympathetic activity airway tone . We determine cardiovascular effect inhale ipratropium albuterol patient FD . Because patient FD few sympathetic neuron denervation supersenstivity , predict follow albuterol inhalation , non-selective activation alpha-1-adrenergic receptor . Furthermore , congenital defect afferent baroreceptor neuron sense blood pressure , suspect result vasoconstriction unopposed lead pressor effect . We hypothesize inhalation anti-cholinergic ipratopium produce little rise heart rate , due extent parasympathetic denervation heart .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Of Bronchodilator Therapy On Respiratory And Autonomic Function In Patients With Familial Dysautonomia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial dysautonomia ( FD ) rare fatal autosomal recessive disease cause deficiency protein IKAP.1 This result selective developmental defect affect mostly afferent ( sensory ) neuron include dorsal root ganglion cranial nerves.2 , 3 We show recently protein deficiency impairs development afferent baroreceptor pathway , leave sympathetic efferent neuron reduce number functionally active . This result complete failure detect buffer fluctuation blood pressure lead volatile hypertension . In addition afferent baroreflex pathway , deficiency IKAP embroyogenesis also affect function chemoreflex pathway . As result , patient fail increase ventilation adequately response hypoxia hypercapnia.4 As well impairment neurological mechanism regulate breathing , patient FD also combination obstructive , restrictive probably also neuromuscular lung disease . Failure coordinate swallowing result recurrent bout aspiration pneumonia occur birth.5 , 6 Imaging study show almost patient FD bronchial wall thickening , atelectasis almost 30 % bronchiectasis7 . Pulmonary function test show air flow limitation associate lung restriction reduction diffusion capacity12 . Sudden attack asthma like wheeze common 8 frequently associate emotional upset,5 time sympathetic outflow vasculature increase heightened.3 There also component restrictive lung disease , high incidence scoliosis , frequently begin early age . Complicating matter , many patient opt undergo spine fusion surgery , 9 could potentially worsen chest wall compliance.10 Patients FD also lack muscle spindle , 2 make likely neuromuscular abnormality arise absence proprioceptive feedback respiratory muscle involve coordination breathe . Severe respiratory disease lead cause death patient FD many treat empirically inhaled bronchodilator . It know , however , whether drug effective reversing increase airway resistance . Hence , urgent need understand short act beta-2-adrenergic agonist albuterol anticholinergic ipratropium , effective bronchodilator . Furthermore , treatment agent potential cardiovascular side effect , also analyze effect blood pressure , heart rate cardiac output .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis familial dysautonomia ( RileyDay syndrome , hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type III ) 2 . Ages 12 older : Bronchodilators routinely use young child FD therefore include study . The spirometry maneuver highly dependent patient cooperation effort , FD patient already limitation make spirometry maneuver problematic perform difficulty mouth closure drool . Therefore , believe age 12 suitable age FD patient include study , though general population reliable result obtain age 6 sometimes even young . 3 . Patients use Albuterol Ipratroprium include study instruct take 24 hour prior test . It common practice clinical medicine withhold inhalation drug prior perform pulmonary function test order evaluate response bronchodilator , integral part test . Patients acute respiratory exacerbation enrol , withhold bronchodilator would advisable . 4 . Patients take medication might affect autonomic function antihypertensive , betablockers , midodrine florinef include study record current medication regimen time medication take . 1 . Patients last use inhaled anticholinergic beta2agonists within 4half life drug . 2 . Patients acute respiratory illness 3 . Patients lobectomy . 4 . Patients use oxygen therapy throughout day . 5 . Patients unable comply study requirement .</criteria>
