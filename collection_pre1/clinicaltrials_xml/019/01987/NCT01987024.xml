	<brief_summary>It consist evaluate advantage routine detection phIGFBP-1 reduce total duration hospitalization patient risk preterm labor 32 week gestation without increase number preterm labour . Methods Patient risk preterm labor ( ultrasound cervical length &lt; 25 mm +/- described record uterine contraction ) 32 week gestation hospitalize receive tocolytic drug antenatal corticosteroid therapy accord gold standard protocol . After 48 hour , assessed examination , external tocodynamometry measure cervical length ultrasound . Stabilized patient include randomized 2 group 210 patient . The first group `` A '' benefit standard protocol ( extend hospitalization 2 4 day accord clinical ultrasound assessment ) ; whereas second group , `` B '' , benefit detection phIGFBP-1.If result prof negative , patient could discharge early day 2 . In case positive result , patient follow standard procedure low positive predictive value test . The main outcome total duration hospitalization . Study duration The trial period 36 month . Expected result The use detection IGFBP-1 would enable u select patient risk decrease duration hospitalization case negative result . Perspectives The negative predictive value phIGFBP-1 test could useful select patient stabilize risk preterm labor , could discharge early . Moreover could use , Perinat Sud network , decide patient risk preterm labor would benefit hospitalization level II III maternity ward .</brief_summary>
