	<brief_title>Comprehensive Gene Sequencing Guiding Treatment Recommendations Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility logistics associate clinical trial utilize Foundation Medicine Incorporated ( FMI ) test academic therapeutic setting . II . To determine proportion patient receive cancer-related therapy base result provide FMI test . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore report estimate progression free survival ( PFS ) regimen administer FMI test result reveal PFS recent regimen administer FMI test result receive . II . To determine feasibility perform Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) metastatic tumor tissue . III . To determine feasibility administer cancer-related drug propose result NGS Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved patient 's specific cancer diagnosis . IV . To collect report molecular alteration discover NGS advance breast colorectal cancer . V. To determine exploratory manner concordance genomic alteration detect FMI test circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) genomic alteration detect FMI test tumor tissue collect patient . OUTLINE : PART I : Within 10 week begin treatment regimen , tumor tissue sample CTCs patient collect NGS FMI testing , respectively . Patients remain current line therapy change treatment warrant . The physician 's treatment recommendation document prior release FMI result . PART II : Physicians furnish FMI test result patient become eligible change therapy new treatment recommendation document . Treatment dependent preference physician , patient , and/or result FMI test . After completion study , patient follow least 18 month .</detailed_description>
