	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine efficacy forearm rotation orthosis combine occupational therapy task-oriented approach functional performance person hemiparetic arm . Hypotheses study : 1. participant wear forearm rotation orthosis demonstrate significantly great improvement functional performance active range motion forearm rotators compare ; 2. participant receive occupational therapy task-oriented approach intervention demonstrate significant improvement functional performance ; 3. participant receive occupational therapy task-oriented approach intervention demonstrate improvement motor function upper extremity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Persons central nervous system ( CNS ) dysfunction often difficulty incorporate affected limb effectively efficiently functional task due muscle weakness and/or spasticity . This may interfere performance everyday activity restrict life role . Traditional rehabilitation intervention emphasize spasticity reduction . However , active movement muscle strength forearm supination find strongly relate motor function , rather spasticity . In contrast , task-oriented movement training trial demonstrate promising evidence person CNS dysfunction benefit training improvement motor function increase functional use affect limb . Orthotic intervention one therapeutic option population . Most orthotic design population static , develop sympton reduction deformity prevention , aim wrist hand . However , effect spasticity reduction remain controversial . Given static orthotics may interfere functional performance develop learn nonuse affected limb , dynamic mobilization orthosis would appropriate enhance functional performance . Moreover , orthosis assist forearm rotation speculate enhance functional performance . This study examine efficacy forearm rotation orthosis combine occupational therapy task-oriented approach functional performance person hemiparetic arm .</detailed_description>
