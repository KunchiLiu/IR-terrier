	<brief_summary>Mitral valve reconstruction commonly require use anuloplasty device assure long-term durability repair . Among mitral anuloplasty device , vary rigid complete flexible ring substitute , recent one aim restore natural saddle shape mitral annulus , order decrease stress tension mitral leaflet chordal attachment . So far , even flexible ring device , sustain flexibility device remain unproven , probably cicatricial fibrotic tissue ingrowth implantation . Due specific structural characteristic base nitinolstent carbofilm-coating , MEMO 3D ring device SORIN claim preservation ring flexibility cardiac cyclus . Consequently , mitral anuloplasty device expect decrease stress systolo-diastolic movement valve , , improve late durability repair . Echocardiography first-line technique mitral valve assessment surgical repair , intra-operative evaluation serial follow-up valve function . Recently , three-dimensional echocardiography introduce clinical practice , afford qualitative quantitative measurement mitral valve function size cardiac cycle.This method allow quantify precisely excursion mitral annulus systole diastole . The aim study analyse systolo-diastolic movement mitral annulus use anuloplasty SORIN MEMO 3D device , surgical implantation sustainability , 1 year implantation . This hypothesis test case-controlled comparison standard use rigid ring device . Therefore , 3-D echocardiography perform time surgical repair , 1 year , define size surface change mitral anuloplasty device cardiac cycle . Based sample size calculation , 10 patient comparison group include , suggest study cohort 20 patient eligible mitral valve repair .</brief_summary>
