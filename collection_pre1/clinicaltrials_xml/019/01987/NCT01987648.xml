	<detailed_description>Background Amongst many surgical subspecialties particularly field neurosurgery make major advancement last decade regard microsurgical technique continuously push boundary radical tumor resection ensure patient security functional integrity nonetheless mention one aspect . However , surgeon close patient transfer intensive care intermediate care unit observation crucial early postoperative hour brain tissue expose hemodynamic respirational change . Early postoperative bleeding brain swelling fear complication elective craniotomy neurosurgery . Unfortunately , bedside monitor diagnose complication early state . Patients become symptomatic clinical neurological deterioration early postoperative seizure . Therefore , much attention pay provide close monitoring observation patient usually critical care unit first hour brain surgery . Although substantiated hard evidence , major postoperative strategy follow : 1 . Parameter orient : Periods arterial hypertension , hypoventilation arterial CO2 increase , low oxygen saturation , extensive coughing , press , pain strictly avoid . In order achieve goal patient remain intubated sedate first hour postoperatively . 2 . Symptom orient : The awakened patient monitor clinically early possible deterioration consciousness , seizure development new neurological deficit . Thus , patient extubated timely fashion postoperatively . Evidently , strategy opposite , since strategy 1 require keep patient sedate intubated long period time wean artificial ventilation perform critical care unit . This hinder early diagnosis neurological deterioration timely action . On contrary , strategy 2 aim early extubation patient immediately complete surgical procedure , expose patient hemodynamic cardiopulmonary stress may lead high likelihood secondary neurological injury . Since , best investigator ' knowledge , prospective data , depend philosophy neurosurgeon , anesthetist neuro-intensivist one strategy prefer another . For clinical study , Department Neurosurgery Berne conduct prospective observational study show early tracheal extubation follow elective brain surgery feasible safe . Objective The investigator aim provide prospective data respect complication early extubation compare result exist data literature delay extubation strategy elective craniotomy . The investigator believe early extubation continuous clinical monitoring coincide high rate postoperative complication . Furthermore , strategy 2 might even superior strategy 1 respect . Also , conduct clinical trial investigator hope get profound insight improve postoperative patient management elective brain surgery . The primary endpoint incidence significant postoperative intracranial hemorrhage , brain swelling seizure lead either surgical intervention new , secondary neurological deficit , coma , palliative care death relate postoperative event . As secondary endpoint investigator assess role routine early postoperative CT imaging transfer ward surgical drain . Methods This clinical study design prospective monocenter observational trial . Data define case report form collect patient undergo elective craniotomy department neurosurgery University Hospitals Bern . Patient data collection begin admission end hospital discharge except mortality follow-up 30 day postoperatively . Statistical analysis perform define study protocol .</detailed_description>
