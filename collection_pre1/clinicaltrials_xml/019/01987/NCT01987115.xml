	<brief_summary>Trigger finger relatively common disorder affect hand . There limited evidence efficiency traditional physiotherapy treat condition . Fascial manipulation gain momentum manual therapy method . To knowledge efficiency fascial manipulation technique treatment trigger finger report . The purpose study investigate efficiency technique compare traditional physiotherapy treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Fascial Manipulation With Traditional Physiotherapy Treatment Trigger Fingers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All adult patient diagnose trigger finger primary investigator eligible study . Criteria diagnose condition history catch involve finger accompany pain A1 pulley volar aspect hand . Exclusion criterion include patient lock finger ( SST Grade IV Quinell classification modify Green ( 18 ) ) , age young 18 , traumatic trigger finger ( post-surgery fracture distal forearm hand ) , patient low pain tolerance ( hyperalgesia/allodinia etc . ) , trigger thumb , multiple ( 1 ) recurrent trigger finger patient receive additional treatment finger past year , motor vehicle work accident patient additional compensation claim , patient condition may cause secondary catch include tumor involve finger joint , inflammatory condition especially rheumathoid arthritis , patient osteoarthritis involve specific metacarpo-phalangeal joint . Patients commit attend plan therapeutic session also exclude study . All subject inform study consent obtain . The patient randomize two group base draw closed envelope box contain equal number note respective therapeutic protocol . Each patient undergo 8 session therapy period 6 week . Group A protocol include U.S. treatment deliver A1 pulley area ( 3 MHz , 1cm² , 5 minute ) , MP PIP joint mobilization ( 5 minute ) , eccentric stretching , self exercise home ( self-stretch self-massage ) . Group B protocol receive fascial manipulation include deep kneading muscular fascia 3 center coordination ( C.C ) : 1 . C.C pronator teres muscle . ( M.F unit INTRA-CUBITUS ) , 2 . C.C proximal part pronator quadratus muscle , palmaris longus flexor carpus radialis tendon ( M.F unit INTRA-CARPUS ) , 3 . C.C mid-palmar region metacarpus 3-4 ( M.F unit INTRA-DIGIT ) . Demographic data include age gender , previous medical history record . The duration symptoms finger involve noted . The patient undergo brief assessment include determination SST accord modify Quinell classification , determination number trigger event occur 10 active flexion/extension cycle . The grip power ( average 3 time ) pinch measure use dynamometer . An x-ray involved hand obtain rule concomitant condition hand . The patient ask fill Quick Dash questionnaire VAS chart . A similar assessment repeat 6 week independent assessor , blind protocol use . Six month end treatment mail survey conduct patient treatment succeed . The survey include information recurrence condition ( No recurrence , occasional pain catching , full recurrence ) VAS scale Quick DASH questionnaire . We consider difference 1.5 point VAS two treatment group 6 week clinically significant . Assuming 20 % decrease VAS traditional physiotherapy , consider α value 0.05 β value 0.2 obtain 80 % statistical power , allow 35 % lose follow-up , plan recruit 70 patient study , 35 patient treatment group . The data record statistical analysis perform use Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet .</detailed_description>
