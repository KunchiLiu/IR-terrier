	<brief_summary>This phase II , multicenter , open-label study evaluate safety efficacy MLN9708 combination Lenalidomide Dexamethasone patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma . The patient population consist adult men woman young 66 year , confirm diagnosis MM meet eligibility criterion . Following screening period , patient enrol treat , receive induction therapy ( 3 cycle ) , systematic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell harvest . After Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation , patient enter consolidation phase ( early late one ) 2 month transplantation . Finally , patient follow Maintenance therapy ( start 1 month last cycle consolidation ) 12 month .</brief_summary>
