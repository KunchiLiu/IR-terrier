	<brief_summary>Glaucoma world 's second leading cause irreversible blindness . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate incidence blindness due glaucoma 4.4 million people worldwide 2002 . Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) sole proven modifiable risk factor development progression glaucomatous optic neuropathy . Medical therapy aim lower IOP order prevent slow progression . Exfoliation syndrome ( XFS ) common identifiable cause open-angle glaucoma , affect estimate 60 70 million people worldwide . Approximately two-thirds patient disease one eye clinical examination ; however , XFS detectable eye conjunctival biopsy . XFS also systemic disease , effect cardiovascular cerebrovascular system . Patients XFS twice likely convert ocular hypertension glaucoma . Glaucoma XFS severe primary open angle glaucoma . There great diurnal IOP fluctuation , great visual field loss optic nerve head damage time diagnosis , poor response medication , rapid visual field progression frequent need surgery . Because meet eligibility criterion study , ask consent participate study describe . In brief , take investigational drug ( AR-12286 , rho-kinase Inhibitor ) either 0.5 % 0.7 % day 6 month . This drug currently test patient primary open-angle glaucoma , yet glaucoma exfoliation syndrome . Because mechanism glaucoma XFS mechanism action rho-kinase inhibitor , reason think would effective eye XFS glaucoma primary open-angle glaucoma ( ordinary glaucoma ) . There baseline study day 1 visit , week 1 visit , month 1 3 visit , week 13 visit , month 6 visit week 25 visit ; total 7 office visit .</brief_summary>
