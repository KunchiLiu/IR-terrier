	<brief_title>The Safety Efficacy Jobelyn Treatment Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer one frequent malignant tumor woman Nigeria . In Nigeria , among urban woman , number breast cancer patient increase annually , age population increase age-specific incidence . Case control study part country identify factor null parity , late age marriage , late age first pregnancy important risk factor . It also suggest western dietary influence change lifestyle urban woman could one major cause slowly rise incidence breast cancer Nigeria . Therefore early detection search potential anti-tumour compound important control breast cancer.Standard treatment modality improve overall outlook quality life woman breast cancer ; however , fact 50 % still succumb disease highlight need new therapeutic approach identification new therapeutic target . Jobelyn make Sorghum bicolor grow abundantly many part world . Major component analysis raw material finish product show herbal product contain oligomeric polymeric proanthocyanidin ( OPCs ) class flavonoid complex . They also refer condensed tannin . They first discover 1948 Jacques Masquelier , develop later patent technique extraction proanthocyanidin pine needle grape seed . They also find apple , coconut , cocoa bean , black currant , green tea , black tea . Cocoa bean contain high concentration . In preliminary research , proanthocyanidin report anti-mutagenic activity . Studies also show proanthocyanidin antioxidant capability 20 time powerful vitamin C 50 time potent vitamin E2 . They also work directly help strengthen blood vessel improve delivery oxygen cell . Having affinity cell membrane , provide nutritional support reduce capillary permeability fragility . These owe role stabilization collagen maintenance elastin . Oligomeric proanthocyanidin help cancer treatment inhibit initiation progress cancer cell . This accord study , find Jobelyn water extract strong effect increase Cluster Differentiation 69 expression Natural Killer cell ( high cytotoxic activity ) Jobelyn Ethyl Alcohol extract great effect increase Cluster Differentiation 69 expression Natural Killer T-cells , T-cells monocyte ( activation &amp; proliferation ) . In addition selective cytotoxicity property , oligomeric proanthocyanidin may up-regulate certain apoptosis promoter gene down-regulate apoptosis-inhibitor gene cancerous cell . 3-Deoxyanthocyanidins rare type flavonoid restrict plant specie . They major pigment flower sinningia ( Sinningia cardinalis ) find silk tissue certain maize line . Sorghum dietary source 3-deoxyanthocyanidins , present large quantity bran cultivar . Many plant use secondary metabolite protect pathogen attack . In sorghum , defense response active process result accumulation high level 3-deoxyanthocyanidin phytoalexins infect tissue . Luteolinidin apigeninidin two major 3-deoxyanthocyanidins . Flavonoids increasingly recognize range health benefit , reduce risk cardiovascular disease cancer due antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , chemoprotective property . In particular , anthocyanins anthocyanidins different source show suppress proliferation induce apoptosis cancer cell line . In recent study , 3-deoxyanthocyanidins find antioxidant property similar anthocyanins , stable power hydrogen , temperature , light change , suggest could serve alternative source natural pigment nutraceutical property . The unique property 3-deoxyanthocyanidins may extend biochemical activity well . For example , Shih et al . recently demonstrate major sorghum 3-deoxyanthocyanidins aglycons , apigeninidin luteolinidin , cytotoxic human cancer cell anthocyanidin analogue , cyanidin pelargonidin Recent research publication confirm variety Sorghum bicolor Jobelyn produce contain two unique compound report first time Sorghum nature compound test vitro anti-inflammatory property use Ibuprofen control . They show superior result Ibuprofen safety efficacy property . Hitherto , 3-deoxyanthocyanidins know contain two main compound , apigeninidin luteolinidin increase four compound , courtesy two new addition discover unique Sorghum variety main ingredient Jobelyn . Anaemia , commonly define haemoglobin level &lt; 14g/dl men &lt; 12g/dl woman , occur 30 % cancer patient point time , incidence increase treatment disease progression . This anaemia could relate patient ( haemoglobinopathy , gastrointestinal problem , thalassemia , etc . ) , related disease ( bone marrow infiltration , bowel resection , hypersplenism , diminish nutritional state ) relate therapy ( drug-induced haemolysis , hypoplasia bone marrow-bearing area pelvis secondary radiotherapy , bone marrow renal toxicity secondary chemotherapy , etc. ) . Inflammatory cytokine tumour necrotic factor-alpha interleukin-6 , among others , play major role pathophysiology anaemia cancer patient , complex mechanism purely inflammatory situation also genetic regulatory aspect erythropoiesis . Oxidative stress bring overwhelm body free radical disease ( cancer ) therapy contribute increase haemolysis immune depression , degrade cell lining disrupt many biochemical pathway . Jobelyn , contain majorly oligomeric proanthocyanidin , prevent cell membrane damage disrupt biochemical formation free radical , thus prevent release haemolytic inflammatory cytokine . In tandem , mop free radical , would find useful delay onset opportunistic infection cancer patient , provoke haemolysis . However , function still prove Human Clinical Trials far carry two research centre Nigeria , though primarily amongst sickle cell HIV/AIDS patients1 . However , experimental trial extend cancer patient assess usefulness condition .</detailed_description>
