	<brief_summary>The purpose study search hereditary ( genetic ) cause uterine fibroid . Some woman uterine fibroid may one gene make likely develop uterine fibroid . We try identify gene well understand uterine fibroid develop design well treatment option woman uterine fibroid . This information may also help u understand treat problem may cause gene .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biologic Predictors Leiomyoma Treatment Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There little information predict outcomes leiomyoma therapy . It clear environmental exposure genetic predisposition influence disease manifestation . Our work identify new area genetic linkage leiomyoma genome wide scan . We therefore propose prospectively collect biologic sample allow u analyze gene/environment interaction woman enrol leiomyoma clinical trial undergo leiomyoma clinical treatment use methodology use previously . Specifically collect serum aliquot , genomic DNA information use genetic epidemiology questionnaire . In short term also able use prospectively obtain information epidemiologic anthropomorphic data characterize woman undergo treatment .</detailed_description>
