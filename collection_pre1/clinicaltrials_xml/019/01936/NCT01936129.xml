	<brief_summary>This randomise controlled trial ass neuroprotective effect Cop-1 ( Copaxone ) patient acute primary angle closure ( APAC ) . The standardized management APAC include medical therapy reduce intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , follow laser peripheral iridotomy . Cop-1 administered addition standard therapy subcutaneous dose within 24 hour presentation , one week later ( total 2 injection ) . The control group placebo addition standard regimen . Subjects study visual field test perform Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer II , retinal nerve fibre layer ( RNFL ) thickness measure Stratus optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) Optic nerve head evaluate Heidelberg retinal tomography ( HRT ) . At least 2 baseline visual field test also perform first week . Subsequent visit week 4 , 8 , 12 16 . The outcome criterion difference visual field , RNFL thickness , optic nerve head structural change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim To assess neuroprotective effect Cop-1 ( Copaxone ) reduce functional structural damage acute primary angle closure ( APAC ) Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure point-wise linear regression visual field . The secondary outcome measure evaluation structural change , namely , RNFL thickness Optic disc change measure stratus OCT HRT respectively . Study population The study population ( n=196 ; 1:1 randomisation ) patient APAC attend Singapore National Eye Centre fulfil inclusion criterion willing take part study . Study design : The study design randomize , placebo control , double blind trial patient APAC randomize receive either Cop-1 ( Copaxone ) placebo addition standard medical therapy . An interim analysis conduct 40 patient complete trial . Routine examination do visit .</detailed_description>

Informed consent • evidence prior acute angle closure attack ( presence iris whorling , focal iris atrophy , glaucomflecken history acute red eye decrease vision ) . This include senile iris sphincter atrophy ) ; Preexisting chronic angle closure glaucoma eye APAC secondary cause angle closure like subluxed lens , uveitis , trauma neovascular glaucoma ; cataract deem significant enough require surgery course trial make field test optic disc image technically possible visual acuity le 6/36 due type cataract ; corneal abnormality , medium opacity , retinal abnormality would affect scan laser polarimetry ; previous intraocular surgery ; currently pregnant nurse woman , woman consider pregnancy ; Severe health problem preclude followup endstage heart disease , kidney disease , respiratory disease , cancer life expectancy le one year .
