	<brief_summary>Postoperative pulmonary complication uncommon liver transplantation . They prolong stay intensive care unit hospital also increase morbidity mortality rate . The underlying mechanisms multifactorial , however , oxidative stress follow hepatic ischemia reperfusion ensue pulmonary leukocyte infiltration play important part pulmonary complication . Various drug method ischemic preconditioning use lessen production oxidative free radical follow hepatic ischemia reperfusion . The choice different anesthetic agent could aslo change degree production oxygen specie antioxidant capacity operation . Volatile intravenous anesthetic agent decrease oxidative injury different mechanism , however , good prevent pulmonary leukocyte infiltration still unknown . We attempt compare oxidative stress cytokine level liver transplant recipient desflurane propofol anesthesia evaluate kind anesthetic agent well kind surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The occurrence postoperative pulmonary complication hepatic reperfusion , patient undergo liver transplantation , major concern intensive care unit . Not neutrophil infiltration , also oxidative injury , demonstrate intra-operative hepatic ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) management . Previous study show reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) paly major role ensue damage , although I/R-induced remote organ injury complex multifactorial process . Methods reduce ROS generation , ischemic preconditioning , attenuate liver lung damage hepatic I/R . Considering intra-operative ROS production occur hepatic reperfusion , choice anesthetic may alter magnitude ROS production antioxidant capacity . Volatile non-volatile anesthetic exert antioxidant capacity different mechanism . Propofol ( 2,6-diisopropylphenol ) report provide antioxidant capacity scavenge free radical . However , volatile anesthetic isoflurane , desflurane sevoflurane reduce oxidative damage anesthetic preconditioning . Several animal study demonstrate volatile anesthetic offer protection ischemia-reperfusion injury intravenous anesthetic . On contrary , intravenous anesthetic may protective sepsis-induced hepatic injury volatile anesthetic . However , investigation concern effect different anesthetic remote pulmonary injury clinical setting . In study , propofol desflurane use maintenance anesthesia liver transplantation . The heart function , respiratory function , liver function , kidney function , oxidative injury inflammatory mediator compare two group .</detailed_description>
