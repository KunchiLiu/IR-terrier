	<brief_summary>Isoniazid ( INH ) drug commonly use treat TB worldwide . Sometimes , bacteria cause TB become resistant INH . Resistance mean bacteria adapt drug able live presence drug . When TB become resistant INH , INH work well fight bacteria . This study treat people INH-resistant TB different dos INH see INH still fight bacteria increase dose . We compare well drug work high dos participant resistant TB well drug work regular dos participant TB resistant . The study also compare safety tolerability different dos INH . Tolerability well people put side effect drug . Using increased dos INH treat TB resistant INH experimental approve regulatory authority . While evidence approach work , yet prove . This study do two stage . Stage 1 pilot study determine feasibility enrol enough participant Stage 2 , large stage study . If Stage 1 successful , Stage 2 begin .</brief_summary>
