Incremental impact may gain structured , objective-specific MM programming service delivery . The MoMent ( MOther MENTor ) implementation research study evaluate impact structure vs routine peer support PMTCT outcomes Nigeria , focus two North-Central state , Federal Capital Territory Nasarawa . The intervention consist simple detailed standardize training curriculum MMs couple daily MM supervision dedicate personnel well standardize , user-friendly tool MMs supervisor use service delivery . These trained MM , along trained MM Supervisors , form basis Mentor Mother Intervention package .
