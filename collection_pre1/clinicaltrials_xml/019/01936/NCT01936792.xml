	<brief_summary>The purpose use Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging ( DKI ) , Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) rest state functional MRI examine tissue damage brain people concussion , acute 3 month accident . A secondary purpose examine whether result scan associated physical , cognitive emotional problem concussion . It hypothesize change diffusion signal measure DKI thalamus ( THA ) DTI corpus callosum ( CC ) , acute stage follow-up mTBI subject compare healthy control . Secondary expect change diffusion signal measure DKI DTI WM GM area acute stage follow mTBI subject compare healthy control . Also rs-fMRI marker secondary expect differ two group . Moreover secondarily MRI marker test correlation severity PCS acutely follow mTBI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pathology Brain After mTBI - A Multimodal MRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 25,000 people Denmark , year diagnose commotio cerebri result head trauma ( National Patient Registry , 1996 ) , foreign study report 5 15 % symptom persist beyond 3 month ( 5 ) . Post commotio symptom ( PCS ) typically divided physical , cognitive emotional symptom include headache , fatigue , memory loss , stress , etc.. It known previous study traumatic brain injury cost disable process failure intervene long term costly ( 11 ) . In Denmark date systematic consistent treatment people persistent symptom 3 month commotio cerebri , lack general knowledge pathology standardization regard diagnosis prognosis also miss . Commotio cerebri , also know mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) often define exogenous traumatic stimulus cause physiological disruption brain function ( American Congress Rehabilitation Medicine ) . This include biochemical cascade , edema , micro-haemorrhages , diffuse axonal injury ( DAI ) change activity internal network brain ( 12 , 13 ) . In severe trauma , conventional scan method Computer Tomography ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) detect bone rupture , edema micro-haemorrhages , mTBI , often difficult detect edema micro-hemorrhages , conventional method often sensitive enough show pathology especially beyond acute period , although patient continue physical symptom well cognitive emotional problem ( 6 , 12 ) . More MRI technique , routinely use clinic , verify DAI change cortical network compare healthy control ( 12 ) . One method Diffusional tensor imaging ( DTI ) use detect DAI white matter ( WM ) . DTI study confirm DAI several WM area mTBI ( 12 ) . Other study show DAI detect DTI several place WM correlate cognitive problem mTBI ( 1,2,6,13 ) . A recent less studied MRI method Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging ( DKI ) display DAI WM prove sensitive DTI detection damage gray matter ( GM ) ( 3 , 4 ) . A study human show significant difference individual mTBI healthy control , thalamus several WM area ( 3 ) . This study also show correlation DKI marker thalamus capsula interna cognitive problem multiple domain mTBI . DKI therefore suggest used addition DTI relation detect tissue damage WM GM . Another MRI method show promising result relation mTBI rest state functional MRI ( fMRI-rs ) . Rs-fMRI show difference brain network connectivity mTBI patient compare healthy control ( 9 ) . A study base theory Default Mode Network ( DMN ) also show high degree sensitivity specificity patient classification subacute phase ( 8 ) . Generally longitudinal study , large publication participant consensus area associate MRI verify pathology still miss . Also correlation MRI marker physical , cognitive emotional problem still solve . It purpose use three research base scan method detect tissue damage brain person concussion , acute 3 month accident . Moreover correlation MRI maker register physical , cognitive emotional symptom concussion examine . It hypothesize change Mean Kurtosis thalamus , corpus callosum hippo campus baseline follow-up . Secondary examine change Mean Diffusivity Fractional Anisotropy thalamus , corpus callosum hippo campus baseline follow-up DKI DTI examine difference mTBI subject healthy control acute stage follow-up . Moreover examine correlation MRI marker severity PCS acutely follow . Finally rs-fMRI default mode network expect differ two group Materials methods The study design control observational trial follow . 35 individual mTBI 35 match healthy control ( age sex ) examine . Persons mTBI scan within first 14 day mTBI follow-up 3 month . Controls scan . The MRI scan perform CE-approved MRI scanner Aarhus University Hospital , Noerrebrogade 44 , 8000 Aarhus C , Denmark . A standard protocol MRI use contain structural T1 , susceptibility weight image ( SWI ) T2 FLAIR sequence purpose visualize anatomy , micro hemorrhage edema . It expect finding standard protocol present acute stage follow-up . The novelty current study use optimize newly develop fast DKI scan sequence , make possible use DKI clinical setup . In addition , date provide follow-up 3 month mTBI DKI ( 9 month Grossman study ) . Symptom Questionnaires : Both baseline 3 month follow-up three questionnaire fill `` The Rivermead postconcussion symptom questionnaire '' , `` The Symptom Checklist '' ( SCL-8AD ) The Brief Illness Perception questionnaire '' ( BIPQ ) . Control Persons also fill questionnaire . Statistical consideration : Power calculation upcoming study base upon previous study Grossman et . al . ( 3 ) MK THA Baseline : 35 mTBI subject ( mean 0.74 , sd 0.08 ) , 35 healthy control ( mean 0.89 , sd 0.04 ) , power = 100 % MK THA Follow : 25 mTBI ( mean 0.78 , sd 0.06 ) , 25 healthy control ( mean 0.89 , sd 0.12 ) power = 96 % An ANOVA use test difference signal two time ( &lt; 14 day 3 month mTBI ) . Additionally , make pair comparison mTBI individual . Both primary secondary outcome show uncorrected Bonferroni correct . Regions parameter show significant difference , compare symptom score use Spearman rank correlation , control age sex . Risks , side effect disadvantage : MRI : All project participant review checklist compare contraindication . There evidence harmful effect MRI , precaution follow . Additionally subject provide earplug protect noise scanner . The clinical scan see neuroradiologist abnormality suspect , picture evaluate . If abnormality real subject get additional examine appropriate guidance conduct involved neuroradiologist . While image research part primarily use clinical use , make clinical diagnostic evaluation brain scan necessarily evaluate person clinical radiological competence . Research Ethics statement : The technique use non-invasive include method like intravascular catheter , injection contrast agent medication . There radiation danger , study associate significant side effect , risk disadvantage participant . The project involve competent subject participate voluntarily adequate verbal write information write consent . The participation may time leave study investigation without justify . The study involve treatment subject withdraws agreement , affect right present future treatment Recruitment : People concussion recruit Department Radiology Aarhus University Hospital . Controls recruit recruitment system Sona Systems posters contact information . Notification Data Protection Agency : The project register data inspectorate Region Midtjylland 's `` Health Scientific research Central Denmark Region '' . Personal information keep confidential destroyed study complete . The project progress accordance Act Processing Personal Data ( http : //www.datatilsynet.dk/borger/forskningsprojekter/ ) . Publication result : Publication result project coordinate Project Manager accordance guideline specify `` Guidelines Good Scientific Practice '' ( Committee Scientific Dishonesty , 1998 ) . Positive well negative , result conclude , publish international scientific journal . Financial support : The project initiate Hospital Hammel Neuro Center . There sponsorship secondary economic interest involve project .</detailed_description>
