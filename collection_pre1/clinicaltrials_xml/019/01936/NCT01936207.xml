The purpose study answer follow question : What frequency disease burden SARI ICU 's worldwide ? What aetiologies ICU SARI ? How SARI patient diagnose manage ICU ? What outcome SARI ICU ? Is difference outcome SARI depend aetiology disease ? Can identify high-risk category SARI could constitute defined population interventional study ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Care - GLObal Study Severe Acute Respiratory Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following recent outbreaks SARS H1N1 influenza infection , significant interest surveillance patient severe acute respiratory infection ( SARI ) , define World Health Organisation ( WHO ) acute respiratory illness recent onset ( within 7 day ) manifest fever ( ≥ 38°C ) , cough , dyspnea require overnight hospitalization . Whereas definition SARI may prove practical mount sentinel SARI surveillance system , unlikely provide relevant information intensive care physician regard nature infection , spectrum severity , diagnostic treatment strategy use subset patient ultimately admit intensive care unit . Only subset SARI patient define WHO require ICU admission oxygen therapy positive pressure ventilation ; small subset develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) even small proportion require adjunctive treatment nitric oxide , ECMO , use prone position high frequency oscillation ( HFO ) . Obtaining accurate information epidemiology ICU-SARI patient currently diagnose treat help u understand factor associate progression acute respiratory infection severe form critical illness ARDS , septic shock , multiple organ failure . We thus aim undertake prospective , observational , inception cohort study investigate epidemiology microbiology profile ICU-SARI , document commonly use treatment monitoring strategy , measure current outcomes identify potential topic multidisciplinary study range interventional clinical trial fundamental mechanisms disease . Fourteen day international inception cohort study adult ( ≥18 year ) patient present SARI admission ICU ( ICU-SARI ) . The study perform 4 week . Each centre include patient 2 week , one November January . First week : 3 - 9 Nov 2013 Second week : 10-17 Nov 2013 Third week : 13-19 Jan 2014 Fourth week : 20-26 Jan 2014 To eligible patient must ICU-SARI define follow 1 . Admitted Intensive Care Unit due respiratory tract infection 2 . Recent onset ( within 7 day prior ICU admission ) least one follow manifestation : - Dyspnea - Fever ( ≥ 38°C ) - Possible , probable microbiologically confirm respiratory tract infection The follow exclude study : Patients le 18 year age Patients pneumonia cough dyspnoea present seven day Any patient invasive ( endotracheal tube ) mechanical ventilation prior admission reason general anaesthesia surgical procedure . Any patient previously include study study period Data collection start admission ICU continue daily basis ICU maximum 28 day . The vital status day 60 record ( discharge , alive ICU , dead ) long patient still hospitalize . For subgroup investigator voluntary basis , end-point extend day 90 day 180 . This international study aim recruit many centre possible . A network national coordinator identify . It task group individual enrol site within country , ensure necessary regulatory approval place coordinate national communication . ICU define unit able provide positive pressure ventilation continuous monitor hemodynamic respiratory variable . Recruitment participate ICUs do advertising study ICUs register ERIC ; ICUs register ESICM database ( membership &amp; congress , H1N1 registry , EuSOS , Euro-BACT ; ICUs register SAPS 3 ; ICUs register VENTILA . We also plan seek participation ICUs research network may interested joint research effort topic ( Sepnet , Capnetz , GiVITI , ICNARC , CCCTG , ANZICS , SPCI ) .Through study specific web site . And advertise National international meeting .</detailed_description>
