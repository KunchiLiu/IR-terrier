	<brief_title>Optimal Fluid Management Adult Severe Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Fluid therapy severe malaria severe sepsis . Severe falciparum malaria cause multiple organ dysfunction include metabolic acidosis , coma , anemia , acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , pulmonary edema . The mortality rate disease still around 15-23 % despite optimal antimalarial therapy . Supportive therapy intensive care crucial element treatment multiple complication disease . Optimal fluid therapy however , one fundamental element supportive therapy , well define . A large randomize controlled trial fluid therapy shock African child ( FEAST study ) show fluid bolus resuscitation increase mortality severe malaria . A retrospective study adult patient severe malaria show fluid load effect acid-base status renal failure . A recent study group show liberal fluid management guide invasive monitoring associate improved renal function acid-base status , aggravate pulmonary edema patient develop pulmonary capillary leakage admission intensive care unit . The study find 38 % severe malaria patient develop clinical pulmonary edema , 80 % occur liberal fluid resuscitation . In study , plasma lactate crude measure tissue hypoperfusion correlate degree sequestration ( directly observe OPS image ) , volume fluid resuscitation . It conclude liberal fluid management indicate adult severe malaria . However , study show patient severe malaria present intravascular dehydration , often able maintain proper fluid intake considerable time . Failure give patient enough fluid therapy could therefore expect precipitate renal failure tissue hypoperfusion . Overall , evidence suggests severe malaria , liberal fluid resuscitation harmful despite patient often hypovolaemic admission . The minimum fluid therapy require prevent complication yet define . Currently , clinician guidance except general adage : `` keep dry '' . Evidence fluid therapy sepsis septic shock also limit . Goal-directed resuscitation first 6 hour recommend Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline ( SSCG ) , base two randomize control study . Fluid challenge one method use achieve goal , administration fluid boluses initial high volume intravenous fluid . Due inclusion guidelines1 , early goal-directed therapy ( EGDT ) fluid challenge become common clinical practice resource-rich country . On hand , efficacy large fluid bolus resuscitation question low level evidence physiological support lack clinical control trial compare fluid bolus therapy versus fluid bolus therapy . The variable availability mechanical ventilation must consider make recommendation fluid resuscitation . Since access mechanical ventilation often limited develop world setting , recommendation SSCG applicable context without additional evaluation . Recently , FEAST trial East African child compensate shock severe malaria sepsis reveal fluid bolus therapy 20 40 mL/kg body weight cause dramatic increase case fatality . Several study find positive fluid balance associate increased mortality sepsis septic shock . A retrospective study ( VASST study ) include 778 patient septic shock show significant correlation positive fluid balance time point 12 hour day 4 increase mortality . In SOAP study , multicenter prospective cohort study enrol 1177 patient sepsis , cumulative fluid balance within first 72 hour onset independent predictor mortality . Also , prospective observational study 164 patient septic shock report significant difference 90-days mortality patient higher fluid volume infuse ( &gt; 4.0 L ) low volume ( &lt; 4.0 L ) day 1 . They conclude initial fluid volume administer associated mortality patient septic shock . Optimal initial fluid volume strategy sepsis septic shock thus unclear . Especially resource-limited country , fluid overload dangerous resource-rich country , development pulmonary edema ALI/ARDS almost always fatal setting without access mechanical ventilation . The recommendation fluid bolus resuscitation therapy promote SSCG therefore evaluate cautiously resource-poor setting . Rationale As outline , optimum fluid management severe malaria sepsis yet establish , particularly resource poor setting access mechanical ventilation limit . Whilst liberal fluid resuscitation appear deleterious , clear minimum fluid requirement ; study aim address question . Procedures The investigator longitudinally monitor hemodynamic parameter along cumulative fluid administration fluid balance conventional fluid strategy , practice local physician . For monitoring , use transpulmonary thermodilution arterial pulse contour analysis ( PiCCO-plus , Pulsion Medical System , Germany ) . The PiCCO system routine use part standard clinical practice provide hemodynamic monitoring severely ill patient admit ICU . It use central venous arterial line provide continuous monitoring hemodynamic function . Overall , investigator believe monitor hemodynamics use PiCCO system give valuable new insight relationship fluid management renal function , pulmonary edema , acid-base status adult patient severe malaria . Patients severe sepsis recruit comparison group , volume status evaluate manner .</detailed_description>
