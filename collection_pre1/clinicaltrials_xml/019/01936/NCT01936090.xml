	<brief_title>Bortezomib , Melphalan , Total-Body Irradiation Before Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) bortezomib add high dose melphalan low dose total body irradiation part condition chemotherapy myeloma . ( Phase I ) II . To determine efficacy bortezomib add high dose melphalan low dose total-body irradiation ( TBI ) patient myeloma undergoing stem cell transplantation , define achievement complete response ( CR ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine toxicity associate addition bortezomib high dose melphalan TBI patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) . II . To determine progression free rate 1 2 year . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient achieve minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negative status . II . To assess HevyLite assay prior treatment . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study bortezomib follow phase II study . CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients receive bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) day -5 -2 , TBI twice daily ( BID ) day -5 -2 , melphalan IV 1 hour day -4 -3 . TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo autologous bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplant day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 100 day every 90 day 3 year .</detailed_description>
