	<detailed_description>I . Background Significance A . Historical Background Scientific Basis Background The common cause withdrawal restriction drug already market prolongation QT interval , consequent , potentially fatal , arrhythmia , torsade de pointes1 . First describe 1960s quinidine therapy2 , torsade de point occurs commonly antiarrhythmics3 , although sudden cardiac death risk increase 270 % use non-cardiac QT-prolonging medication4 . The QT interval electrocardiogram reflect ventricular myocardial repolarization , abnormality duration QT interval common indicator abnormal repolarization . Although number hypothesis exist abnormal repolarization , specifically QT prolongation , result ventricular arrhythmia , consistent finding appear prolonged depolarization sodium channel recover inactivation reactivate , cause term early afterdepolarizations . When combined heterogeneity repolarization well , early afterdepolarizations create favorable myocardial substrate reentry , result propagation intramyocardial reentry wave torsade de pointes5 . On cellular level , ion channel directly associate repolarization potassium-conducting , thus medication gene associate QT prolongation effect potassium current . Specifically , blockade HERG/KCNH2 ( IKr ) ion channel implicate majority drug-induced QT prolongation6 , although ion current involve congenital long QT syndrome , include IKs ( KCNQ1 KCNE1 ) , INa ( SCN5A ) , IK1 ( KCNJ2 ) . Sudden cardiac death result QT interval prolongation subsequent ventricular arrhythmia ( torsade de pointes ) devastate adverse effect many common medications7 , 8 . Drug-induced QT prolongation number one barrier new therapeutic agent make market . While number medication , environmental factor , genetic factor associate QT prolongation , ability predict individual basis develop QT prolongation , mention torsade de pointes , limited . Human genetics provide opportunity change paradigm enable discovery individual risk toxicity . The continuous QT interval heritable9 , multiple environmental genetic contributor . We use genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) identify 60 common polymorphism collectively explain QT interval know clinical factor combine . However , knowledge application information patient level incomplete . A personalized genetic approach toxicity prevention would important cardiotoxic drug response specific single class drug ; risk prediction arrhythmogenicity apply across medication use variety condition . Narrowly , research enable drug currently marginal risk/benefit profile bring market , spar at-risk provide access new therapy . From public health perspective , reduce potentially fatal toxicity thus improve human health identification particular at-risk individual . But broadly application human genetics require rigorous definition association well-powered -designed test pharmacogenetics broad application consider . B . Previous Studies In meta-analysis three prospective cohort -- Cardiovascular Health Study , Framingham Heart Study , Rotterdam Study -- 13,685 white people European descent part QTGEN consortium , Newton-Cheh colleague identify common variant association ( p &lt; 5x10-8 ) five locus previously associate QT interval : NOS1AP , KCNQ1 , KCNE1 , KCNH2 , SCN5A , well new association 5 locus previously unrecognized influence myocardial repolarization10 . At 10 locus , 14 independent variant explain 5.4 - 6.5 % variation QT interval , explain sex age , strong non-genetic clinical factors10 . A QT genotype score base variant associate 9.7 - 12.4ms long QTc top quintile compare bottom quintile meta-analysis sample , include heterogeneous age , risk factor drug exposure profiles10-12 . These effect consistent individual European African American ancestry . This QT score independently validate Finnish population sample complete medication ascertainment enable exclude QT-altering therapy , QT score associate 15.6ms QT interval difference top bottom quintiles13 . In analysis , correlation measure effect estimate original association study obtain 0.99 . The QT base genotype score significant predictor actual QT interval measure ( P &lt; 10-107 ) . This study important current proposal ) demonstrate consistency genetic effect estimate derive meta-analysis heterogeneous study apply independent sample b ) confirm exclude individual QT-altering drug therapy reduce noise non-genetic source QT variation improve genetic signal thereby increase power . Moxifloxacin well-suited study drug-induced QT prolongation , know cause transient mild QT prolongation . Compared placebo , 400mg oral moxifloxacin associate approximately 10 msec increase heart rate-corrected QT interval14 , 15 . Despite increase QT interval , report increase risk sudden death oral administration single dose moxifloxacin16 , safe well-validated drug use study cardiotoxic drug response healthy human subject . Moreover , widely use pharmaceutical industry positive control require FDA demonstrate sufficiently sensitive method detect QT prolongation . We demonstrate QT interval prolongation moxifloxacin pilot study 20 subject recruit Massachusetts General Hospital . Apparently healthy male female volunteer 18 50 year old eligible : free know cardiovascular , renal , hepatic disease , personal family history sudden cardiac death , use prescribe over-the-counter medication , bradycardia QTc prolongation electrocardiography , normal potassium magnesium . Subjects receive 400 mg oral moxifloxacin placebo different day exactly 9AM morning ( diurnal variation QT interval well recognized17 ) fast state ( avoid interference absorption ) six ten-second electrocardiogram minimum ten minute rest , record every half hour six hour . Mass spectrometric analysis moxifloxacin level plasma 2 6 hour administration closely match prior reports18 tight range consistent know high bioavailability ( 2hr : 2.8 ( SD 0.47 ) 6hr 2.64 ( SD 0.48 ) ng/μL ) . We observe 12.3 msec increase heart rate-adjusted QT interval average hour 2-6 compare baseline moxifloxacin exposure compare placebo exposure ( ΔΔQTc = +12.3 msec , SD 8.3 ; Noseworthy , manuscript preparation ) . C. Rationale Proposed Benefit Research Drug-induced QT prolongation significant public health risk major barrier drug development19-21 . For example , cisapride , esophageal motility agent use gastro-esophageal reflux , may result 80 death pull market22 . In addition identification culprit medication , also characteristic vulnerable patient , include female sex23 , bradycardia24 , hypokalemia25 , genetic predisposition rare mutations3 , 6 , 26 , place certain individual higher risk fatal arrhythmia . Identification at-risk individual use genetic marker would represent critical advance toward safe pharmacotherapy7 . The basis study expand use genetics beyond rare family mutation predispose risk QT prolongation large-scale screen general population genotyping ( assay specific variant ) relatively common polymorphism could increase risk QT prolongation , subsequent torsade de pointes . II . Specific Aim We hypothesize common genetic variant intermediate effect rest QT , examine aggregate , identify subgroup individual risk exaggerate prolongation QT interval response QT-prolonging medication . This hypothesis test follow specific aim : To assess ability common genetic variant aggregate predict drug-induced QT prolongation healthy subject . We recruit 80 healthy volunteer draw top bottom quintiles QT genotype score assessment QT response moxifloxacin compare placebo Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) . III . Subject Selection A. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : Through separate protocol , Dr. Newton-Cheh recruit date 1000 healthy volunteer age 18 40 consent re-contact basis genotype determine initial screen visit , undergone DNA extraction . From exist collection 1000 subject , approximately 75 % self-described European/Caucasian 8 % African Americans . These otherwise healthy individual age 18 older . For study , genotype 68 independent QT SNPs use Sequenom genotyping array MGH Center Human Genetic Research Sequenom core sample . The genotype score sum predict effect QT interval genotype . For example , SNP rs12143842 C/T SNP ; copy T allele QT interval 3.50 msec high individual TT genotype QT interval 7 msec high CC genotype individual CT genotype QT interval 3.5 msec high . These predicted effect determine 68 SNPs sum create single number , predict change QT interval basis genetic variant . From genotype score , determine set individual belong top bottom quintile QT genotype risk score eligible moxifloxacin study ( see detail genotype score calculation ) . Apparently healthy male female volunteer European African American ancestry , 18 50 year old , eligible free know cardiovascular , renal , hepatic disease , personal family history sudden cardiac death ; use prescribed over-the-counter medication well recreational drug ; bradycardia ( define rest heart rate &lt; 50 bpm ) , conduction disease ( QRS &gt; 100ms ) QTc prolongation electrocardiography ( QTc &gt; 500msec ) ; normal serum potassium ( K &gt; 3.3 ) magnesium ( Mg &gt; 1.8 ) , well renal liver function test . We exclude woman nursing , pregnant planning become pregnant study period , counsel importance use birth control study period , check serum HCG screen visit . We estimate 266 individual ( 133 high lowest quintiles , respectively ) eligible . IV . Subject Enrollment A . Methods Enrollment Procedures Informed Consent : See detail subject identification enrollment . Eligible individual invite come screening visit moxifloxacin study target enrollment 40 genotype group . We plan contact 266 individual upper low quintiles QT genotype score come screen visit . We anticipate invite approximately 160 individual screen visit , goal enrollment sample size 80 individual . These subject contact phone participation study , inform consent obtain arrival screen visit , verify subsequent visit eligible study protocol . V. Study Protocol A . Data Collection : Subjects bring MGH Clinical Research Center initial screen visit eligibility criterion review ( exclusion/inclusion applicable ) , give ECG record . Eligible individual study visit bring back later MGH Clinical Research Center two separate day separate least one week ( ensure washout ) . On visit , receive study drug ( either 400 mg oral moxifloxacin placebo ) allocate double blinded block randomization ( sex genotype group separately ) 10AM fast state ( statistician hold randomization key ; study personnel blind study closure ) . Women screen pregnancy use urine HCG time study visit . They undergo 6 ECGs time 0 30 min interval thereafter , seat position least 15 min rest use fix electrode placement total 6 hour follow administration study drug . At 2 , 4 6 hour draw blood sample plasma moxifloxacin determination mass spectrometry . All ECGs upload research partition GE MUSE 7 ECG database Massachusetts General Hospital , 12 SL algorithm apply interval measurement , use prior study group . We monitor QT every 30 minute throughout protocol identify subject mark QT prolongation . Any subject QTc &gt; 500 m keep HCRC observation , decision either follow-up HCRC every morning less 500ms admitted hospital telemetry base degree prolongation clinician 's judgment . B. Venipuncture : Venipuncture perform use standard technique obtain plasma quantification moxifloxacin level . We collect 10 mL blood 2hrs , 4hr 6hrs study drug administration ( Total 30mL ) . C. Genotyping : Genotyping perform Sequenom genotyping array MGH Center Human Genetic Research Sequenom core exist genomic DNA isolate . VI . Biostatistical Analysis : QT Genotype Score . We plan use modification QT genotype score previously established11 , 12 validate u separate Finnish cohort13 . The score construct use allele copy number effect estimate use follow formula ( Table 1 , next page ) : QTscore = [ ( SNP1 allele copy number ) * ( SNP1 effect estimate m ) ] + [ ( SNP2 allele copy number ) * ( SNP2 allele effect estimate m ) ] + … [ ( SNP68 allele copy number ) * ( SNP68 allele effect estimate m ) ] From genotype score , determine set individual belong top bottom quintile QT genotype risk score ( , expect 75 % ( n=133 per quintile ) ) eligible moxifloxacin study , base prior pilot work . We invite individual come screen visit ( see ) moxifloxacin study target enrollment 40 genotype group . Outcome assessment . Any individual sinus arrhythmia present 50 % ECGs two study visit drop analysis . ECGs premature ventricular atrial beat drop analysis ( uncommon healthy volunteer ) . The QTc use Fridericia 's heart rate correction ( QTc = QT/3√RR ) take average eligible ECGs time point . The ΔQTc calculate difference QTc baseline ( study drug/placebo administration ) time point . From ΔQTc , difference post-moxifloxacin post-placebo ΔQTc calculate time point ( ΔΔQTc ) well . The mean ΔΔQTc 180-300 minute time point ( pilot work publish report expect 10 msec ) compare two genotype group ( top bottom quintile ) use unpaired t-test . We estimate 40 people group need adequate power detect clinically meaningful ( 6.3 msec ) difference QT-prolongation two group base pilot data ( Table 2 ) . An increase 6 msec exposure drug compare placebo threshold FDA raise concern potential drug cause torsade de pointes thus clinically significant . Secondary analysis . We plan perform three secondary analysis . First , examine influence single SNPs strong effect QT response moxifloxacin . As power calculation , study enrollment base aggregate genotype score , expect secondary analysis underpowered . Second , observe significant difference QT response top bottom quintiles QT genotype score , examine influence decile observe result compare 9th ( 80-90 % ile ) 10th decile ( &gt; 90 % ile ) score bottom decile quintile , although give composite nature genotype score additive nature variant , expect threshold effect . Lastly , determine impact baseline QTc QT response test whether additional adjustment baseline QTc alters observe effect genotype score QT response moxifloxacin . Anticipated result . Successful completion primary analysis Specific Aim 1 would identify individual top quintile QT genotype score demonstrate great QT prolongation response exposure moxifloxacin bottom quintile . This would important implication use genetic predictor understand management drug-induced QT prolongation . For one , would demonstrate principle simple genetic test predictive risk drug-induced QT prolongation . Such analysis could perform patient prior use currently approve QT-prolonging medication . Second , would demonstrate gene associate QT prolongation baseline also associate risk drug-induced QT prolongation . This finding would implications risk-predictive level , , also physiological understand mechanisms drug-induced QT prolongation .</detailed_description>
