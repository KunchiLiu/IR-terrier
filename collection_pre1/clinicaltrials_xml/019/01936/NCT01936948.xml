	<brief_summary>The effectiveness colonoscopy reduce colorectal cancer mortality rely detection removal neoplastic polyp . Because risk prevalent cancer transition cancer increase polyp size , effective safe resection large polyp particularly important . Large polyp ≥20mm remove so-called endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) use electrocautery snare . Resection large polyp associate risk severe complication may require hospitalization additional intervention . The common risk delay bleed observed approximately 2-9 % patient . A recent retrospective study suggest closure large mucosal defect resection may decrease risk delay bleeding . However , significant uncertainty remain polypectomy technique optimize resection minimize risk . Important aspect may affect risk include clip mucosal defect electrocautery setting .</brief_summary>

The primary aim study compare rate delay bleed complication patient undergo endoscopic resection large polyp : - A ) Closing mucosal defect resection ( Clip group ) - B ) Not close mucosal defect resection ( No clip group ) . Aim 2 . The secondary aim study compare rate overall complication patient undergo endoscopic resection large polyp two cautery setting : - A ) Low power coagulation - B ) Endocut .</detailed_description>
