	<brief_summary>The ideal stimulation protocol ovarian stimulation constant debate , gain pharmacological control patient hormonal milieu . Specifically , debate focus around ideal LH level . The concept `` LH window '' suggest . The need threshold level LH clearly demonstrate hypogonado-tropic hypogonadism patient , also cycle patient receive high dos GnRH antagonist . The Ganirelix dose find study demonstrate low implantation rate high dose group ( 1 mg , 2 mg ) . The stimulation dynamic patient remarkable low E2 LH level day hCG . In fact , functional state hypogonadotropic hypogonadism achieve , explain poor clinical result ( 1.5 % implantation rate 2 mg Ganirelix ) . The protocol repeat added Luveris result excellent pregnancy rate . The recommended daily dose GnRH antagonist 0.25 mg average provide protection premature LH surge , moderate suppression LH . Therefore , patient need supplement LH antagonist initiate . However , subgroup patient hyper-respond antagonist ( 0.25 mg dose ) sharp decrease LH . This explain contradictory finding available study . The basic assumption background proposal wide range pituitary response GnRH antagonist . Obeying bell-shape curve , woman average response , however , hypo-respond might ovulate prematurely , others hyper-respond . In latter case , pituitary response behave expose high dose . How identify exposure presume high dose ? Below figure original paper . A close look indicate immediate response Ganirelix dose similar term LH drop , however , big difference lie pituitary recovery 24 hour post Ganirelix dose . While small dos allow quick recovery almost pre-treatment LH level , high dos result incomplete recovery . Hence , reasonable speculate high response 0.25 mg dose lead slow incomplete recovery LH level 24 hour post initial dose . It estimate 15 % patient antagonist hyper-responders . Efforts individualize patient protocol must target group candidate supplement LH . This estimate similar study finding : Huirne et al Human Reproduction 2005 , 20 : 359 .</brief_summary>
