	<brief_summary>The main clinical goal NAC down-stage primary tumor BCS , yet BCS NAC associate significantly high ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences.The accuracy breast tumor excision BCS dramatically reduce IBTR.The main reseason IBTR might uncertain shrinkage mode breast cancer NAC.This clinical trial firstly carry make clear shrinkage mode primary tumor 3 cycle whole cycle NAC , respectively , whole-mount serial section ( WMSS ) three-dimensional ( 3D ) pathological reconstruction residual tumor.The second objective investigate predictive value 3D MRI reconstruction shrinkage mode primary tumor NAC .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Female patient , locally advanced breast cancer , age ≥18 year . 2 . Histologically confirm invasive adenocarcinoma breast . 3 . Primary palpable disease confine breast axilla physical examination . For patient without clinically suspicious axillary adenopathy , primary tumor must large 2 cm diameter physical exam image study ( clinical T2T3 , N0N1 , M0 ) . For patient clinically suspicious axillary adenopathy , primary breast tumor size ( clinical T13 , N12 , M0 ) . ( T1N0M0 lesion exclude . ) 4 . Patients without clearly define palpable breast mass axillary lymph node radiographically measurable tumor mass acceptable . Accepted procedure measure breast disease mammography , MRI , breast ultrasound . This need reevaluate 3 cycle prior surgery . 5 . ECOG 0 2 6 . No distant metastasis , document complete stag workup ≤6 week prior initiation study treatment . 7 . No previous treatment breast cancer . 8 .
