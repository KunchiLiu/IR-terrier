	<brief_summary>The purpose research well understand calcium glucose may play role people develop diabetes . By study , investigator hope learn whether abnormal calcium glucose response skin biopsy healthy patient patient Type 2 diabetes identify predict patient great risk later complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Feasibility Study Fibroblast Calcium Glucoregulation Health Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal proposal establish pathophysiological index patient 's status image calcium glucose skin fibroblast . The investigator obtain skin sample patient Barnstable Brown Obesity Diabetes Center University Kentucky test hypothesis calcium glucose dysregulation present fibroblast patient Type 2 diabetes , exaggerate difficult-to-treat patient poor glucose control . The innovation project focus result potentially lead earlier treatment patient diabetes thereby reduce risk long-term complication . Three level analyse conducted ass relationship Ca2+ glucose homeostasis four patient group ( lean non-diabetics , obese non-diabetics , Type 2 Diabetics good glucose control , Type 2 Diabetics poor control . Participants require attend one study visit last approximately 2-3 hour . During study subject undergo following : 1 . Collection two 4 ml tubes blood adiponectin analysis , 2 . A skin biopsy , 3 . Collection review medical history current/past medication use 4 . Collection demographic information , 5 . Height weight measurement 6 . Body mass index evaluation , 7 . Vital sign assessment ( blood pressure , pulse ) . Follow-up enrol patient occur yearly basis phone interview . The punch biopsy perform local anesthesia .</detailed_description>
