	<brief_summary>This study evaluate gait individual Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) walk talk see walking change challenge perform functional cognitive task simultaneously . By look walk alone walk vary cognitive load investigator able determine motor cognitive factor vulnerable interference PD . Each important understand training address component walk become impaired someone distract common cognitive task intensity treatment match level task difficulty . Using initial data , investigator establish protocol improve walk take account unique feature PD , include bradykinesia , freeze gait , stiffness , problem memory attention . The investigator evaluate potential treatment improve walk improve maintain cognitive ability necessary multitask .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study participant ask participate training study examine whether new walk intervention combine cognitive training walk treadmill improves walk gait train cognitive training alone . Participants Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) come lab complete gait assessment use motion analysis system record leg motion muscle activity comfortable walking . During initial evaluation , participant also complete cognitive assessment survey community activity quality life relate PD . Participants divide one three train group ask come lab three time week four week intervention . One week one month training , participant return lab complete assessment perform initial visit . The result three test session ( initial , one week one month ) compare within group see intervention provide unique benefit health person PD .</detailed_description>
