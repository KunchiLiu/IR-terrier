	<brief_title>Multi-center Study Uphold LITE Versus Native Tissue Treatment Women With Anterior/Apical Pelvic Organ Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective evaluate clinical effectiveness transvaginal repair mesh ( Uphold LITE ) traditional native tissue repair woman surgically treat anterior and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse . Secondary objective evaluate Uphold LITE-related complication subject report outcome . The primary endpoint study achieve superiority transvaginal repair mesh ( Uphold LITE ) native tissue repair 36 month compare baseline . Success base composite objective subjective measure . Additionally , co-primary endpoint study achieve non-inferiority transvaginal repair mesh ( Uphold LITE ) native tissue repair safety compare rate serious device serious procedure relate complication baseline 36 month time point . The secondary endpoint study include assessment complication subject report outcome .</detailed_description>
