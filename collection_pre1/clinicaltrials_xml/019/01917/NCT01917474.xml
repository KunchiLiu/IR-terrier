	<brief_summary>Headache frequently disable disorder , occur 30 % adult population , particularly overweight/obese woman . Aim study modify nutritional habit patient evaluate effect low lipid intake vs. normal lipid diet incidence severity migraine crisis . Moreover vascular reactivity evaluate randomly select subgroup patient . This randomized , cross-over intervention trial perform 150 patient , affected migraine .

	<detailed_description>Headache common disease general population , affect adult woman frequently men . Among different factor might involve pathophysiology disease , eat drink particular food drink show act trigger acute attack . In particular food age cheese red wine may trigger acute migraine attack dietary habit excessive caffeine intake may increase headache frequency . Moreover close relationship detect overweight/obesity migraine severity even author show obesity baseline seem relate follow-up refractoriness preventive treatment . At first visit , patient undergo complete clinical examination body weight ( BW ) , height ( HT ) , blood pressure ( SBP/DBP ) heart rate ( HR ) also measure . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate BW/HT2 express kg/m2 . We consider overweight patient BMI &gt; 25 &lt; 30 whilst frankly obese BMI &gt; 30 . Patients followed-up two month treatment prevention headache ( usually calcium entry blocker flunarizine 5 mg/day ) add habitual dietary regimen . At end run-in period patient randomly attribute one follow two dietary regimen : low lipid diet lipid content &lt; 20 % total daily energy intake normal lipid diet lipid intake 25-30 % total daily energy intake . In diet lipid intake mostly represent monounsaturated fatty acid ( 14 % low lipid 19 % normal lipid diet ) low intake saturate fat ( &lt; 8 % total calorie , percentage usually recommend diet ) . Patients followed-up 2 month end switch alternative dietary regimen . At baseline observation period patient see Headache Outpatient Clinic department one month interval . At visit give form fill home , summarize number monthly headache attack , severity one grade 0.1 3 mild severe pain , many time assumed pill therapy attack last month . Headache attack severe pain consider receive score &gt; 2.5 . Moreover , visit patient fill-up food questionnaire , validate comparison 7-day food record ( 12 ) , help well trained dietician . Data express daily percent caloric intake macronutrient weekly number medium size serve . Main drug suggest pain relief attack selective serotonin receptor agonist ( triptans ) , abortive migraine medication , non steroidal anti-inflammatory agent . In randomly select subgroup patient evaluate baseline diet : 1 . Vascular dysfunction echography brachial artery level ischaemia ( Flow mediate dilatation ) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg ; 2 . Intimal-media thickness carotid artery level evaluate b-mode echography ; 3. central pressure pulse wave velocity tonometry applanation .</detailed_description>
