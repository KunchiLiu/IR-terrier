	<brief_summary>The purpose study define precision , accuracy variability NBM-200 system non invasive blood Hemoglobin ( Hb ) measurement relative laboratory blood analyzer compare two consecutive Hb value obtain NBM system venous value .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Evaluate Precision Accuracy NBM-200 Series When Used Continuous Prospective Mode</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject place comfortable position temperature regulate room . Participants two consecutive non invasive ( NBM ) measurements take involves insert thumb ring shape sensor . After non invasive measurement sensor remove . Each measurement take approximately 85 second involve finger cuff inflating ( systolic pressure ) deflate several time quick succession order measure calculate Hb value . The two non invasive measurement perform use finger . After NBM system test complete record , subject venous ( venipuncture ) blood sample collect order provide two blood test perform two different model routine automate complete blood count Hb blood analyzer . Addendum : Reproducibility Procedure ( optional ) Each subject measure one three operator , three NBM system unit , 3 time consecutively ( without removal ) right thumb right index finger . The order measurement sequence randomize ( thumb/index ) . There intermission 3 5 minute 3 measurement set take participant . In case long intermission , subject measure previous result exclude .</detailed_description>
