	<brief_summary>Despite importance , health-related behavior hard change . Among behavior , physical activity associate protection multiple disease . People physically active low risk heart disease , stroke , type 2 diabetes , depression , cancer associate dose-dependent reduction cardiovascular all-cause mortality . However , US adults meet CDC physical activity guideline . Sedentary work behavior industrialized nation likely contributor problem . Current low-technology strategy encourage lifestyle change disappointingly ineffective highly resource intensive . Systematic review literature show mixed evidence use activity tracker ( i.e. , pedometer ) limit body evidence text message preventive health care . However , prior study integrate digital activity track mobile phone text message feedback . Given 91 % adult United States use mobile phone , 56 % smartphone , represent potentially widely applicable avenue therapeutic intervention . There grow interest leverage mobile health ( mHealth ) technology improve health behavior general population . The investigator propose conduct blind , randomize mHealth trial digital activity track smart texting promote physical activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>mActive : A Blinded , Randomized mHealth Activity Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using innovative , convenient , mHealth trial design , pilot study aim test feasibility seamless model information flow integrate digital activity tracker information mobile phone texting system deliver technology-enhanced intervention require in-person follow-up . The investigator hypothesize : 1. individual overestimate physical activity , especially do work . 2. biofeedback activity tracker increase physical activity via increase self-awareness . 3 . `` smart '' text message feedback increase physical activity via personalize health coaching . Digitalized activity track use Fitbug Orb , syncs via Bluetooth one 's smartphone . It display-free triaxial accelerometer , allow one blind participant numeric feedback . Text messaging use Reify Health 's `` smart '' platform personalize , interactive texting automate repeatable algorithm . Texting informed real-time activity information . Potential advantage trial strategy include elimination attendance in-person session , personalization health coaching , continuous patient contact ; inexpensive intervention , ultimate ability scale intervention large target population . After initial pilot trial completion , additional study include long-term physical activity follow-up participant focus group .</detailed_description>
