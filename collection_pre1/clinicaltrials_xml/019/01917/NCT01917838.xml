	<detailed_description>The aim propose study develop theory-informed mobile health ( mHealth ) application urban caregiver attempt improve child 's oppositional conduct relate difficulty ( i.e. , disruptive behavior disorder ; DBDs ) . The majority evidence-based treatment ( EBTs ) target youth DBDs emphasize change specific parenting/family-level process empirically link maintenance DBDs . Existing EBTs frequently include at-home-practice-exercises ( i.e. , homework ; HW ) reinforce parent skill acquisition maximize use new skill child home . Poor quantity quality HW complete parent significantly attenuate effect EBTs . This significant limiting-factor many EBTs attain full public health impact . Given robust effect HW outcomes EBTs across range behavioral health difficulty population , call move beyond question whether HW important question process involved HW implementation best support process . Minimal investigation focus critical question . A model HW recently propose good understand process HW implementation , well guide critically need support at-home practice exercise . This model propose four HW process : 1 . Designing ; 2 . Assigning ; 3 . Doing , ; 4 . Reviewing . The DADR model propose specific social , cognitive behavioral factor relate HW task , well provider adult caregiver may affect quality phase ultimately quantity quality HW complete . Methods well understand , support , impact process essential advance theory offering solution HW completion . Through feature available smartphones ( e.g. , camera/video/voice recording ; simple message service ; internet-access ; global positioning system ) , novel method interface support client outside defined treatment session . Through use feature , mHealth application use engage , educate , connect , track , remind client . These application use push ( send communication ) pull ( client 's access tool ) mechanisms engage client behavioral change activity . mHealth application integrate push pull method offer significant opportunity enhance outcome across range health behavioral health challenge population . The goal two-year R34 treatment development grant response RFA-MH-13-061 ( Harnessing advance health technology drive mental health improvement ) develop mHealth application advance theory clinical practice guide DADR model HW implementation . Specifically aim utilize mHealth improve `` Design '' `` Do '' process HW within context Family Groups Youth Behavioral Difficulties ( MFG ) intervention , EBT DBDs youth family seek assistance outpatient mental health clinic urban community . To date , effort utilize mHealth within context HW minimal take systematic , theory-driven approach , thereby limit advance knowledge clinical application . Through utilizing self-determination theory guide framework integrate principle field `` gamification '' goal-setting , aim develop two-component MFG mHealth HW application ( My MFG ) . The first component focus deliver MFG HW via highly engage , multiplayer , interactive , cooperative , skill-building game platform aim improve `` Design '' `` Do '' process . The second component focus target factor putatively related poor HW implementation within `` Do '' process . The process development My MFG guide clinic community development model iterative software development process maximize feasibility sustainability My MFG within practice setting often characterize limited resource . The specific aim project : 1 . Develop My MFG iterative process inform perspective key stakeholder 2 . Determine impact MFG plus My MFG relative MFG-alone DADR process HW quantity quality . It hypothesize MFG plus My MFG result : 1 . Greater quality `` Design '' `` Do '' process rat therapist , parent , independent coder 2 . Greater quantity quality HW assignment rat therapist parent 3 . Greater quality `` Review '' process rat therapist , parent , independent coder function improve HW quantity quality 4 . Greater satisfaction treatment rat parent , target child , therapists NIMH specifically call acceleration research maximize ability current treatment reduce symptom , improve adherence function improve quality lower cost care . The mHealth application method propose herein serve systematic , theory-driven approach significantly advance understand best support HW process—a common element many EBTs across various disorder populations—ultimately result great effectiveness EBTs , maintenance generalization behavioral skill learn EBTs .</detailed_description>
