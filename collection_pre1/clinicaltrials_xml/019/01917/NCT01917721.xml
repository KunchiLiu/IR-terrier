	<brief_summary>Kawasaki disease ( KD ) affect infant young child cause inflammation skin blood vessel include coronary artery heart . Despite currently available therapy , one third child develop enlargement coronary artery lead serious complication coronary artery stenosis , heart attack even death . Kawasaki disease common heart disease child USA especially common among child Hawaii . Every year , 50-90 child diagnose KD Hawaii unfortunately medication available successfully prevent coronary artery damage subset case . During first week illness , cell immune system attack coronary artery release special substance ( MMP ) responsible coronary artery enlargement . There common antibiotic , doxycycline specifically block action special substance ( MMP ) . Research do animal KD show doxycycline able block special substance prevent enlargement coronary artery . Research adults enlargement main artery abdomen also show doxycycline may improve outcome . Based study doxycycline may promise therapy child KD , develop enlargement coronary artery . The investigator ' propose research study ass usefulness doxycycline prevent progressive enlargement coronary artery child KD . The investigator plan perform small ( pilot ) study evaluate good doxycycline prevent coronary artery enlargement . The investigator treat 25 child KD enlarge coronary artery two week doxycycline assess change coronary artery well blood level special substance ( MMP ) . If doxycycline prove beneficial small study , investigator go design large research study involve multiple institution Hawaii mainland recruit child certain value propose treatment . The investigator ' proposal may change treatment protocol KD could present possible treatment child enlarge coronary artery prevent potentially devastating consequence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxycycline Treatment Prevent Progressive Coronary Artery Dilation Children With Kawasaki Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study attempt reveal whether coronary artery dilation patient Kawasaki disease refractory standard therapy could prevent use matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor : doxycycline . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize oral administration doxycycline two week acute phase Kawasaki disease ( KD ) effectively block matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) activity coronary artery therefore prevents progression coronary artery dilation aneurysm formation child KD . Rationale There specific treatment child KD , develop coronary artery dilation aneurysm . Based animal study adult trial show beneficial effect doxycycline coronary artery dilation abdominal aneurysm , selective MMP-9 inhibitor offer promise therapeutic strategy prevent progressive coronary artery dilation child KD . Specific aim 1 . Measure serum MMP-9 activity , tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase 1 activity ( TIMP-1 ) , serum level degradation product due MMP-9 activity ( elastin gelatin degradation product ) treatment doxycycline child KD . 2 . Compare serum MMP-9 activity degradation product level child receive standard therapy KD ( IVIG , infliximab ) child receive standard therapy doxycycline treatment . 3 . Measure coronary artery diameter doxycycline treatment child KD . 4 . Compare coronary artery measurement child receive standard therapy KD ( IVIG , infliximab ) child receive standard therapy doxycycline treatment . 5 . Design multi-center prospective randomize blind placebo-controlled trial ass efficacy doxycycline prevent coronary artery dilation aneurysm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Treatment arm : Patients age 1 month 18 year confirm KD include study meet follow criterion : 1 . Patients dilation right leave anterior descend coronary artery beyond zscore +3 acute febrile phase KD . 2 . Patients aneurysms right leave main coronary artery acute febrile phase KD . 3 . Patients refractory KD initial treatment IVIG dilate coronary artery echocardiogram first month KD . Comparison arm : Patients age 1 month 18 year confirm KD , meet inclusion criterion include treatment group . 1.Patients right leave anterior descend coronary artery measurement zscore +3 acute febrile phase KD . The following patient exclude study : 1 . Patients clinically incomplete KD . 2 . Patients whose parent refuse administer doxycycline . 3 . Patients acute renal failure . 4 . Patients chronic liver kidney disease .</criteria>
