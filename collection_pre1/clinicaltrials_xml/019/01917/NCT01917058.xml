	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine receive sub-cutaneous injection medication call abatacept cause regrowth hair people alopecia areata . Among patient alopecia areata , patient bad disease unlikely satisfactory outcome current therapy . Our hypothesis Abatacept effective therapy moderate severe alopecia areata block re-activation special type immunecell call memory T-Cell ( CD8+NKG2D+ ) thereby block inflammatory response underlie alopecia areata .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Evaluate Efficacy Abatacept Moderate Severe Alopecia Areata</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alopecia areata ( AA ) common disease immune system , know `` autoimmune '' disease . In disease , immune system mistake destroy hair follicle , cause hair fall . Despite many people disease , research cause new , good way treat AA lag far behind similar disease immune system . Currently , Federal Drug Administration approve drug AA . Abatacept ( make Bristol-Myers Squibb ) safe intervention know effectively treat rheumatoid arthritis , another `` autoimmune '' disease , fight inflammation . There genetic chemical similarity active rheumatoid arthritis AA , suggest treatment drug likely effective . In mouse specially design test drug treatment human alopecia , medication work prevent disease AA start . To test Abatacept , go treat 60 patient moderate severe AA 6 month . To make study result meaningful , control `` placebo '' group receive study drug . Patients randomly assign either receive real inactive medication , neither patient doctor know . The effectiveness medication measure change hair re-growth determined physical exam photography , well patient physician scoring . Patients follow another 6 month drug see effect treatment last delayed response . Small scalp biopsy peripheral blood take begin study treatment 4,12 24 week . The chemical analysis skin sample blood help u understand disease happen , treatment work , even guide u good treatment future .</detailed_description>
