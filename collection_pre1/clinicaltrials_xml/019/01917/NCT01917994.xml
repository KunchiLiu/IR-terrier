	<brief_summary>Retention care virologic suppression key final step HIV treatment cascade . Poor intermittent retention associate later initiation antiretroviral therapy , virologic failure , death . Regular HIV care also associate decrease HIV transmission risk behavior . Despite proven health prevention benefit consistent HIV care , 40-50 % infected HIV United States estimate meet current retention care standard even few - 25 % - estimate virologically suppress . The Behavioral Model Vulnerable Populations provide useful framework understand broad area may impact adherence care treatment . Individual-level domain include vulnerable ( e.g. , depression , stigma ) , enable ( e.g. , social support , positive affect ) , need ( e.g. , co-morbidities ) factor , structural domain include , example , feature clinic provider-patient relationship . Short message service ( SMS ) technology represent new excite tool help retain HIV-infected patient care treatment . SMS intervention deploy successfully support antiretroviral adherence virologic suppression sub-Saharan Africa , two randomize trial show clear benefit . A pilot study conduct clinic suggests use SMS message promote adherence care treatment urban HIV-infected poor feasible acceptable . The investigator believe combine SMS technology content-specific message design impact factor highlight Behavioral Model Vulnerable Populations improve retention care virologic suppression urban public hospital population live HIV , thus investigator propose follow specific aim . Specific Aim 1 : Determine whether behavioral theory-based SMS intervention improve virologic suppression [ primary outcome ] retention care [ secondary outcome ] vulnerable urban HIV-infected population randomize trial technology compare SMS appointment reminder alone . Retention care also analyze mediator virologic suppression . Exploratory outcome include time virologic suppression , sustain virologic suppression , emergency department utilization antiretroviral adherence , well level depression , positive affect , social support empowerment . Specific Aim 2 : Examine patient experience SMS intervention , focus specifically : 1 ) satisfaction technology ; 2 ) identify barrier facilitator patient use technology , ; 3 ) prefer frequency content intervention message . Specific Aim 3 : Conduct cost cost-effectiveness analysis SMS intervention .</brief_summary>
