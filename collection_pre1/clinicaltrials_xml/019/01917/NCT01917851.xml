	<brief_title>Evaluate Accuracy NBM200 Noninvasive Hemoglobin Measurements Obstetric/Gynecological Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject place comfortable position temperature regulate room . Participants two consecutive non invasive ( NBM ) measurements take involves insert thumb ring shape sensor . After non invasive measurement sensor remove . Each measurement take approximately 85 second involve finger cuff inflating ( systolic pressure ) deflate several time quick succession order measure calculate Hb value . The two non invasive measurement perform use finger . After NBM system test complete record , subject venous ( venipuncture ) blood sample collect order provide two blood test perform two different model routine automate CBC Hb blood analyzer .</detailed_description>
