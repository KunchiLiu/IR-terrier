	<detailed_description>This clinical trial design basis unmet clinical need , well factor include : 1 ) ability identify subject high risk die early disease , 2 ) fact hormonal therapy already show improve survival apply early natural history , 3 ) availability chemotherapy cabazitaxel improve survival subject advance disease 4 ) chemotherapy ( docetaxel ) give concomitant hormone treatment proven prolong time progression . It investigators hypothesis appropriate group patient may benefit curative potential systemic chemo-hormonal modality minimal , detectable disease high probability develop metastatic disease , clinical symptom eventually death prostate cancer define time frame . The investigator hypothesize approach likely effective time minimal tumour burden , result minimization overall burden therapy well quality life treatment . This trial determine whether benefit gain add chemotherapy hormonal therapy hormonal therapy alone population subject metastatic high risk disease . Two therapeutic approach compare two-arm randomized clinical trial . The control Arm A provide hormonal therapy alone . The experimental Arm B involve treatment hormone therapy + Cabazitaxel 25 mg / m² / day day 1 every 3 week continue patient stable respond disease 10 cycle . For schematic representation study design please see Section 7.3.1 . Subjects primary metastatic N+ high risk disease ( PSA &gt; 100 ) eligible . The primary endpoint trial overall survival . Based yearly number prostate cancer patient diagnose metastatic high risk disease , approximately 1200 men per year ( +15 % improvement ) potential candidate approach Scandinavian country .</detailed_description>
