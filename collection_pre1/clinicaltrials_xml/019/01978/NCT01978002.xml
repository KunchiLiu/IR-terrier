	<brief_summary>Bladder pain discomfort , well urinary urgency frequency , bothersome symptom see frequently general population . Clinical diagnostic term use describe symptom include interstitial cystitis ( IC ) , bladder pain syndrome ( BPS ) , chronic prostatitis , overactive bladder ( OAB ) , tremendous overlap entity , distinction base eminence evidence . Pain and/or sensory sensitivity suspect play role pathogenesis bladder pain urinary urgency/frequency . However , previous study investigate whether entity IC/BPS OAB might merely represent different point continuum bladder sensory sensitivity . Moreover , know study directly compare sensory sensitivity bladder global ( i.e . CNS-mediated ) sensory sensitivity . In study , team investigator complementary expertise perform population-based study assess bladder overall sensory sensitivity , cohort woman representative population respect entire continuum bladder pain ( none severe ) , symptoms urgency/frequency . These individual undergo urodynamics measure sensory sensitivity bladder , well pressure pain auditory loudness threshold . The Specific Aims demonstrate : 1 ) sensory sensitivity bladder related sensory sensitivity elsewhere body , suggest CNS-driven mechanism , 2 ) individual population great global sensory sensitivity display : ) bladder pain , b ) urgency/frequency , c ) symptoms centrally-mediated pain state , pain region bladder , fatigue , insomnia .</brief_summary>
