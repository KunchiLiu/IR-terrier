	<detailed_description>With prevalence asthma increase decade , focus shift treatment understand pathogenesis asthma may develop method prevention . With advent new bacterial detection technique , opportunity examine infant microbiome ( collection genetic information organism live human pose threat ) prior development wheeze subsequent asthma . Based knowledge certain bacteria associate recurrent wheezing , believe increase pathogenic bacteria alters airway epithelium result airway inflammation . This chronic inflammation lead airway obstruction , result recurrent wheezing . By prospectively follow child two year opportunity determine change see early infancy establish early persist 2 year age . In addition , propose determine microbiome contribute airway obstruction episode wheeze respiratory illness . This study test hypothesis increase pathogenic bacteria within infant airway lead increase airway inflammation , decrease airway function ultimately airway obstruction throughout first two year life . Once enrol , study procedure consist non-sedated passive pulmonary function test Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography ( RIP ) test enrollment ; nasal swabs stool specimen collect enrollment , 3-5 month , 22-24 month ; blood draw 3-5 month ; spirometry perform infant pulmonary function test 3-5 month repeat 22-24 month age ; finally survey complete every three month start 4-6 month time point end 22-24 month time point .</detailed_description>
