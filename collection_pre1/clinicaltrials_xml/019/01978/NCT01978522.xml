The problem reduce effective sample size quality evidence robustness finding , undermine often substantial investment study . Researchers devote increase amount time resource understand participant decide take part research researcher make work appeal potential participant . We explore issue within NICOLA , knowledge , similar work conduct solely within 50 population . Establishing rapport participant mention another method increase response rate explore examine whether receive questionnaire face-to-face exchange increase likelihood completion - topic address aforementioned systematic review . Our randomised comparison online versus paper questionnaire gauge interest online method among 50 , effect different mode completion completeness . Embedding research begin large cohort study allow opportunity test different methodology discover work best regard delivery questionnaires The overall aim research examine impact differ time format self assessment questionnaire completion rate .
