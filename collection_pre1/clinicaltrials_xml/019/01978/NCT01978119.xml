Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status study enrolment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . After confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method ; childbearing potential abstinent agree use one contraception method appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) start dose sufficiently minimise risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception least 2 day post last dose study treatment ; abstinence penilevaginal intercourse must consistent preferred usual lifestyle subject . Severity disease : A best prebronchodilator FEV1 &gt; =40 % &lt; =85 % predict normal value Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) . Predicted value base upon National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) III . If subject record Hispanic Latino ethnicity , MexicanAmerican equation use ( irrespective race ) . If subject record AfricanAmerican/African heritage race , African American equation use . If subject record Asian race , Asian adjustment use . Otherwise , Caucasian equation use .
