	<brief_summary>This 3-arm randomised clinical enabling study , investigational product . Keloid patient schedule surgical excision one keloid scar ( nine ) recruit study . The aim investigate collagen synthesis within keloid scar affect current approved steroid treatment keloid , triamcinolone acetonide ( TAC ) . The primary endpoint fractional collagen synthesis keloid receive intra-lesional injection TAC , placebo treatment prior removal . Fractional collagen synthesis determine use establish isotope/mass spectrometric technique measure level deuterium incorporation collagen follow administration heavy water subject . In addition ; keloid tissue sample evaluate post surgery identify biomarkers extracellular matrix synthesis degradation application future clinical study . Subjects complete screen visit randomise receive three intra-lesional injection TAC placebo , treatment , interval 2-3 week . Subjects randomise different treatment sequence depend number keloid schedule surgery , way subject multiple keloid receive different arm study treatment different keloid . Planned surgery removal keloid ( ) perform week 6-8 . All subject receive daily heavy water ( Deuterium oxide ) administration ( twice daily thrice daily direct ) , first dose take Week 2 clinic visit final dose take day prior surgery . A follow-up visit conduct 1-4 week post-surgery .</brief_summary>
