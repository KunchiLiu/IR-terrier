	<criteria>Male female &gt; =40 &lt; =80 year age time sign informed consent . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone &gt; 40 milli international unit per milliliter ( mIU/mL ) oestradiol &lt; 40 picogram [ pg ] /mL [ &lt; 147 picomole per liter ( pmol/L ) ] confirmatory ) ; females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method ( i.e. , accordance approve product label instruction physician duration study Screening followup contact ) wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status study enrolment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . After confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method ; childbearing potential abstinent agree use one contraception method appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) start dose sufficiently minimise risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception least 2 day post last dose study treatment ; abstinence penilevaginal intercourse must consistent preferred usual lifestyle subject . COPD Diagnosis : An established clinical history COPD accordance follow definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society . Severity Disease : A measured pre postsalbutamol/albuterol FEV1/forced vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.70 Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) A measure presalbutamol/albuterol FEV1 &lt; 50 % predict normal value Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) . A measured postsalbutamol/albuterol FEV1 &gt; =30 % predict normal value Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) . Predicted value calculate use National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) III reference equation . Tobacco Use : Current prior history least 10 packyears cigarette smoking ( e.g. , 20 cigarettes/day 10 year ) . One packyear define 20 manufacture cigarette ( 1 pack ) smoke per day 1 year . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) . Former smoker eligible enter study provide least 10 packyears smoke history . Subjects make conscious decision stop smoking time study refrain smoke &gt; 4 week discontinue study . Additionally , subject start smoke study smoke least 7 consecutive day discontinue study . Dyspnoea : A score &gt; =2 Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale ( mMRC ) Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) Liver Safety Criteria : Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; =2 upper limit normal ( ULN ) , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; =1.5 ULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5 ULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Safety Criteria : The subject must ECG abnormality would , opinion investigator , compromise subject safety , significantly affect subject 's ability complete trial . As investigator determine clinical significance ECG abnormality determine subject preclude enter study . At Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) , ECG safety criterion must : QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) QT interval correct heart rate accord Fridericia formula ( QTcF ) &lt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) QTc &lt; 480 msec subject bundle branch block . Investigators responsible ensure appropriate clinical interpretation ECGs Able use inhaler device adequately train Capable give informed consent , include compliance study requirement restriction list consent form . A current diagnosis asthma Any clinically significant uncontrolled disease , include limited following : neurological , psychiatric , renal , immunological , endocrine/metabolic ( include uncontrolled diabetes , hypokalaemia thyroid disease ) , cardiovascular , neuromuscular , hepatic , gastric , haematological abnormality , peripheral vascular disease . Significant define disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk would affect efficacy analysis disease/condition exacerbate study A respiratory diagnosis COPD ( e.g. , lung cancer , bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , tuberculosis , lung fibrosis ) , include subject diagnosis alpha1antitrypsin deficiency . Allergic rhinitis exclusionary An abnormal clinically significant chest Xray film compute tomography scan believe result presence COPD . A chest Xray must take subject 1 within 6 month Visit 1 ( Screening Run Visit ) Lung resection surgery ( e.g. , lung volume reduction surgery , lobectomy ) within 1 year Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) A COPD exacerbation and/or infection upper low respiratory tract require treatment systemic ( oral parenteral ) corticosteroid and/or antibiotic resolve within 30 day Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) A COPD exacerbation result hospitalisation resolve within 3 month Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) Use nocturnalpositive pressure ( e.g. , continuous positive airway pressure bilevel positive airway pressure ) Oropharyngeal Examination : A subject eligible Runin Period he/she clinical visual evidence candidiasis Visit 1 ( Screening Runin Visit ) An abnormal clinically significant 12lead ECG result .
