	<brief_summary>Oxygen widely available gas cheap , easy get extensively used medicine . From animal study become apparent increase lower degree oxygen blood , inflammatory response alter . We investigate also true human increase , lower keep oxygen level normal give healthy subject short inflammatory stimulus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine effect hyperoxia hypoxia compare normoxia human endotoxemia model innate immune reponse healthy volunteer . A parallel , randomized study healthy male volunteer . The subject randomize hypoxia , hyperoxia , normoxia , undergo experimental human endotoxemia ( administration 2 ng/kg LPS iv ) . In hypoxia group : subject breathe individualized mix nitrogen room air 3.5 hour use air-tight respiratory helmet . The gas mixture adjust achieve saturation 80-85 % . In hyperoxia group , subject breathe 100 % oxygen 3.5 hour use respiratory helmet . In normoxia group , subject breathe room air ( 21 % oxygen , 79 % nitrogen ) also wear respiratory helmet . 1 hour oxygen status adjustment ( t=0 ) , subject administer intravenous bolus ( 2ng/kg ) LPS derive E coli O:113 . 2.5 hour LPS administration , helmet remove subject breathe ambient room air . The primary study endpoint difference plasma cytokine hypoxia normoxia group , hyperoxia normoxia group . Secondary objective include HIF-1α protein mRNA , aHIF mRNA expression circulate leukocyte , measure ROS , leukocyte phagocytosis , cytokine production leukocyte stimulate ex vivo various inflammatory stimulus , measurement basic hemodynamic ventilatory parameter temperature .</detailed_description>
