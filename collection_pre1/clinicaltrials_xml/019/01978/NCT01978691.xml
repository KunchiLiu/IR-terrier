At follow-up visit participant receive guidance exercise healthy diet . The primary variable study relative change baseline end-of-treatment body fat mass . Comparisons active group placebo group perform global P-value significant . Secondary variable analyze similar fashion . The relative absolute change body fat mass also analyze . To explore mechanism potential treatment benefit , post-hoc responder analysis may optionally perform . Also , correlation response variable may examine exploratory analysis . Post-hoc analysis may conduct compare e.g . different time point analyze difference end-of-treatment follow-up .</detailed_description>
