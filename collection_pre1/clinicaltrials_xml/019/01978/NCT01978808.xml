	<detailed_description>For diagnosis pancreatic tumor , endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) EUS-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) well establish technique clinical practice . In case EUS , ultrasonic transducer locate tip echoendoscope allow endoscopist visualize wall gastrointestinal tract series definable layer correspond histology , also enable detailed image area outside digestive tract . EUS significant clinical impact allow assessment submucosal GI lesion , loco-regional stag gastrointestinal malignancy , tissue diagnosis EUS-FNA staging pancreaticobiliary lesion , non-small-cell lung carcinoma , mediastinal disease . In prospective trial , EUS-FNA clearly establish important diagnostic tool excellent safety profile . Olympus recently make commercially available new 22 gauge FNA needle side port needle tip facilitate process FNA increase diagnostic yield . There preliminary unpublished retrospective data suggest yield might raise . However , prospective multicenter randomize controlled study ascertain validity assumption . The aim prospective randomize study determine whether difference diagnostic yield EZ-Shot 2 ( model : NA-220H-8022 ) EZ-Shot 2 side port ( NA-230H-8022 ) patient pancreatic mass evaluation . We hypothesize FNA needle side port could improve diagnostic yield .</detailed_description>
