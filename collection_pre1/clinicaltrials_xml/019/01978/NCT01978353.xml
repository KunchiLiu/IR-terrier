Yet conclusion study pharmacological treatment population still controversial , make imperative invest new efficient therapy non pharmacological intervention aim memory improvement . One training mode benefit elder association name face , compel clinical relevance consider one main complains among elder difficulty remember name . However , exact effect kind training elder ( i.e . eventual change cognition brain activation Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) still unclear . Therefore , study aim verify effect memory training ( name-face association ) compare control intervention - psychoeducation , 30 elder amnestic MCI . We request participant amnestic MCI submit Cerebrospinal Fluid ( CSF ) order improve accuracy diagnosis . Training psychoeducation conduct 4 session ( two per week ) .
