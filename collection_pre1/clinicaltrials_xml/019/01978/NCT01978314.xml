	<brief_title>FAST GFR : Pilot Study Evaluate Safety FAST GFR Test Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A rapid accurate measurement glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) important acute kidney injury ( AKI ) chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) assessment impairment , diagnosis , prompt treatment . FAST BioMedical emerge technology company whose mission quantify clinically mean ful physiological parameter difficult impossible measure . GFR clinically relevant metric understand renal function , rate kidney able filter waste product bloodstream . The FAST mGFR direct measurement GFR rely read ratio fluorescent marker attach different size dextran molecule introduce bloodstream . The test intend adjunct current method utilized assess kidney function .</detailed_description>
