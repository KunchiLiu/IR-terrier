	<brief_title>Are Serial Electrocardiograms Additive SeriAl Second-generations Troponins Predicting Acute CoronAry Syndromes PatienTs With Undifferentiated cHest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chest pain one common symptom evaluate Emergency Department ( ED ) . One primary diagnostic concern evaluation presentation whether evidence acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) ACS major risk factor short- long-term major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE , define acute myocardial infarction , revascularization , all-cause death ) . Two cornerstone guidelines-based evaluation patient group serial electrocardiogram ( ECG ) troponin measurement ( serological marker myocardial ischemia ) , show independently incrementally predictive ACS . Recently , second-generation troponin assay adopt clinical practice high sensitivity specificity ACS compare old assay . Given increase diagnostic accuracy novel second-generation assay , propose study 's research question investigate whether serial ECG change significantly increase diagnostic accuracy serial second-generation troponin change predict MACE patient present symptom consistent ACS . In order investigate question , originally propose observational pilot study ancillary HEART Pathway trial ( WFUHS IRB00021074 ) , fund randomize control trial investigate recently develop decision aid tool ( HEART score ) design identify patient evaluate chest pain safely forgo objective testing . We propose add collection two additional 12-lead ECGs protocol HEART Pathway trial , include serial second-generation troponin collection , order generate pilot data regard research question . As recruitment HEART Pathway trial end February 2014 , propose continue enrollment ASAP CATH study independently , prospective observational study evaluate additional prognostic value serial ECGs standard care patient chest pain evaluate acute coronary syndrome Emergency Department . Objective : The goal project produce preliminary data investigate whether presence absence serial ECG change suggestive myocardial ischemia aid reclassify participant ' risk MACE objective evidence ACS serial second-generation troponin test . Methods : Adult patient , 21 year old , present WFBMC ED chest pain symptom concern ACS , provider order cardiac biomarkers ECG eligible enrollment . We aim add serial ECG analysis ( one time study enrollment second time study blood draw ) protocol propose study . The primary outcome major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) 30 day evidence acute myocardial ischemia via objective cardiac testing perform index hospitalization .</detailed_description>
