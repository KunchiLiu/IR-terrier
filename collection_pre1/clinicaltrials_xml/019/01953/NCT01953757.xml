	<detailed_description>The following determination make baseline , mid-point , end 20-week study period , well one-year follow : General status , symptom , medication accounting . Participants ask report change health medication use . Disease Activity . The following assessment use measure pain change sensory perception relate diabetic neuropathy : Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument . The MNSI questionnaire consist 15 question follow single 8-point clinical examination involve inspection foot , assessment ankle reflex , semi-quantitative determination vibration perception . Norfolk Quality Life Questionnaire Norfolk QOL-DN 47-item questionnaire develop Eastern Virginia Medical School , Norfolk , VA , assess subject ' perception effect diabetes diabetic neuropathy . It consist 28 item pertain specifically small fiber , large fiber autonomic nerve function symptom , activity daily live ( ADL ) . Neuropathy Impairment Score Lower Limbs ( NIS-LL ) The NIS-LL low limb component full Neuropathy Impairment Score ( NIS ) 3 domain include : muscle weakness , reflex , sensation . The maximum score 88 point . Based experience data collect clinical trial , Peripheral Nerve Society consider 2 point change NIS-LL correspond meaningful change clinical status . Neuropathy Total Symptoms Score ( NTSS-6 ) Neuropathy total symptom score-6 ( NTSS-6 ) neuropathy sensory symptom scale design evaluate frequency intensity individual neuropathy sensory symptom identify frequently patient DPN . A total six question synthesize identify quantify specific positive negative symptom associate sensory deficit patient . Neuropathy Pain Scale In order ass differentiate quality pain , Galer Jensen develop Neuropathic Pain Scale ( NPS ) 1997 . The NPS compose 10 item assess two global pain domain include pain intensity unpleasantness , six pain quality , include sharp , hot , dull , cold , sensitive , itchy pain , two dimension ( internal cutaneous ) . McGill Pain Questionnaire The McGill Pain Questionnaire ( MPQ ) use specify subjective pain experience use sensory , affective evaluative word descriptor . The short form McGill Pain Questionnaire ( SF-MPQ ) contain 11 question refer sensory dimension pain experience four related affective dimension . Global Impression Scale Global impression scale ( GIS ) also term global rating change scale ( GRC ) develop assess patient ' overall improvement deterioration clinical setting , frequently use musculoskeletal chronic pain trial . Height . Height measure baseline ( ) participant stand barefoot back wall-mounted stadiometer heel wall , record near 0.5 cm . Body weight . With participant wear light , indoor clothing without shoe , body weight measure near 0.1 kg , use digital scale . Blood pressure . A digital blood pressure monitor cuff size appropriate participant 's arm use . The cuff size participant record consistency use visit . Participants ask remove clothing cover location cuff placement rest seat position 5 minute legs uncrossed , without talk reading . The back arm support middle cuff upper arm level right atrium ( mid-point sternum ) . Three measurement take 1-minute interval . The first measurement disregard , mean remain 2 measurement calculate . Serum cholesterol triacylglycerol concentration measure use Olympus Cholesterol Reagent Olympus Chemistry Analyzers . HDL-cholesterol measure directly use HDL-C plus 3rd generation test Roche direct HDL-cholesterol assay.Low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) concentration estimate use Friedewald equation . Plasma triglyceride level measure use Olympus Chemistry analyzer Quest Diagnostics . Comprehensive Metabolic Panel . These value evaluate baseline , 20 week , one-year follow-up . Hemoglobin A1c . Hemoglobin A1c measure whole blood use COBAS INTEGRA Roche clinical chemistry analyzer . Glucose . Plasma glucose measure use Olympus Chemistry Analyzer Quest Diagnostics , Baltimore , MD , USA . Urinary albumin creatinine assess spot urine sample . Samples albumin assay test use K-Assay High-Sensitive Microalbumin assay Quest Diagnostics . Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) : Participants consent aspect study genotyped ε2 , ε3 , ε4 alleles . A sample approximately 5 ml participant 's blood require drawn simultaneously 20-week health assessment lab . Individuals diabetes greatly increase risk develop Alzheimer 's disease , study suggest effect saturate fat intake Alzheimer 's risk may evident ( even limit ) carrier APOEε4 allele . The ApoE protein produce APOE gene major plasma apolipoprotein primary cholesterol carrier brain [ 62 ] . As group , individual higher plasma LDL concentration , compare APOEε3 homozygotes [ 63 ] Moreover , APOE status may influence relationship dietary intake plasma lipid concentration [ 63 ] . APOE determination may provide useful information benefit dietary change aim modify plasma lipid concentration , implication subsequent risk cardiovascular disease Alzheimer 's disease . The blood test drawn , 20-week health assessment . This test optional . If participant decide test , affect status study . The blood sample collect used APOE allele test study . All sample destroy analysis part specimen retain per policy Quest Diagnostics . Genotyping Taq1 A Taq1B polymorphism . Participants consent aspect study genotyped A1 B1 allele , use PCR method [ 64 ] A sample approximately 5 ml participant 's blood require drawn simultaneously 20-week health assessment lab . Studies suggest A1 allele Taq1A polymorphism ( rs1800497 ) , locate ≈10 kb downstream D2 dopamine receptor ( DRD2 ) gene , may influence dietary behavior response treatment . Individuals A1 allele generally lower-than-normal complement dopamine receptor ( DRD2 ) human brain , likely others engage smoking , substance abuse , compulsive gamble [ 65 ] . The prevalence A1 B1 alleles DRD2 gene strongly associate severe alcoholism [ 66 ] . Further , A1 allele also common among obese individual [ 67 ] . We identify allele approximately half individual type 2 diabetes participate research study [ 68 ] . The possibility genetic factor may influence dietary behavior may mean extended support essential facilitating dietary transition among many , , individual diabetes . In group setting , support engage cost effective . The blood test drawn , 20-week health assessment . This test optional . If participant decide test , affect status study . The blood sample collect used TaqA1 allele test study . All sample destroy analysis part specimen retain per policy The Biological Samples Processing Core Facility ( BSPC ) University California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) . All participant undergo assessment peripheral autonomic neuropathy via SUDOSCAN test . SUDOSCAN FDA clear device ass Galvanic Skin Response ( Sudoscan 510 ( k ) clearance , premarketing submission make FDA demonstrate device market safe effective , , substantially equivalent ( SE ) , legally market device subject premarket approval ) . Previous work show galvanic skin response promising , sensitive , simple tool detect diabetic neuropathy , production perspiration depend presence functional small nerve fiber . One study 83 diabetic patient 210 healthy control show Sudoscan measurement show sensitivity 78 % specificity 92 % , good well clinical evaluation methods.48 In addition , test-retest reliability high , especially feet.49 A study 167 type 1 type 2 diabetic show galvanic skin response improve 1 year intense insulin therapy.49 This method appropriate inclusion study non-invasive , objective way assess neurological function . Participants place palm sol large area stainless-steel electrode stand still 3-minute scan . A low voltage ( &lt; 4V ) apply incrementally electrode , generate current ( around 0.2mA ) proportional chloride ion sweat gland palm sol . The electrochemical skin conductance measure microSiemens foot hand record SUDOSCAN . 2-day dietary record : A 2-day dietary record use assess macro- micronutrient intake . Participants give option complete manual online version ( online : http : //riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/instruments/asa24/ ) collect calculate diet nutrient intake . Participants need Internet access choose online version . If necessary , digitized record analyze use Nutrition Data Systems Research software ( University Minnesota ) , register dietitian certified Nutrition Coordinating Center . 24-Hour Multi-Pass Dietary Recalls . At week 3 12 , register dietitian make unannounced telephone call participant administer 24-hour diet recall , use multi-pass approach ( Nutrition Coordinating Center , University Minnesota , Minneapolis , MN ) . These recall subject statistical analysis , allow investigator check poor adherence . The ASA-24 software tool develop National Cancer Institute . It enable automate self-administered 24-hour dietary recall . The format design ASA-24 base modified version interviewer-administered Automated Multiple Pass Method ( AMPM ) 24-hour recall develop U.S. Department Agriculture . Participants provide user name , password , link ASA-24 online diet recall Web site . The Eating Inventory highly reliable 51-item questionnaire provide quantitative measure dietary restraint , disinhibition , hunger . It serve gauge ease adapt intervention diet . The International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form assess recent physical activity pattern . The method highly reliable ; assessment test-retest repeatability produce correlation 0.8 . The Clinical Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised ( CESD-R ) assess mood . The CES-D 20-item self-report measure design originally use among general population . It measure frequency participant experience specific symptom within precede week , use four-point rating scale . The Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ) assess mood . It widely use instrument detect depression . The question BDI-II alignment DSM-IV criterion . Each item list four statement arrange increase severity particular symptom depression . Overall quality life assess use SF-36 , brief health survey 36 question . The SF-36 provide psychometrically-based physical mental health summary measure . The SF-36 general measure administer across various age group , disease spectrum , treatment regimen . Items SF-36 scored scale 0-100 , high score indicate good health-related quality life . Medications . Participants group ask keep medication constant add new nutritional supplement current medication regimen , except recommend personal physician . The intervention diet supplement group supplement-only group describe : The diet supplement group ask follow low-fat , vegan diet take daily vitamin B12 supplement 1000mcg methylcobalamin 20 week . According American Dietetic Association , vegan vegetarian diet meet nutritional requirement appropriately planned.The diet consist whole grain , vegetable , legume , fruit , restriction energy intake . Animal product , add oil , sugar exclude . In choose grain product starchy vegetable ( e.g. , bread , potato ) , participant encourage select retain natural fiber glycemic index &lt; 70 , use table standardize value 100 glucose . No meal provide . Participants handle food preparation purchase , guidance research team . Participants provide commercially available supplement contain vitamin B12 ask take daily study . Should wish continue diet thereafter , counsel use standard multivitamin reliable source vitamin B12 . The supplement-only group follow unrestricted diet , give identical vitamin B12 supplement 1000mcg methylcobalamin diet group . Before randomization , participant tell either assign diet supplement intervention group supplement-only group .
