	<brief_summary>PLEASE NOTE - THIS STUDY IS CURRENTLY ONLY RECRUITING PARTICIPANTS WITH OSTEOSARCOMA . The purpose study find large safe dose GD2-T cell ( also call iC9-GD2-CAR-VZV-CTLs ) , additionally evaluate VZV vaccine improve expansion persistence infuse T cell , learn side effect , see whether therapy might help patient advanced sarcoma . Because standard treatment recurrent/refractory sarcomas time currently use treatment work fully case , patient ask volunteer take part gene transfer research study use special immune cell . The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight cancer : antibody T cell . Antibodies type protein protect body infectious diseases possibly cancer . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include cell infected virus tumor cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer . They show promise , strong enough cure patient . Investigators find previous research new gene put T cell make recognize cancer cell kill . Investigators want see new gene put cell let T cell recognize kill sarcoma cell . The new gene call chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) consist antibody call 14g2a recognizes GD2 , protein find sarcoma cell ( GD2-CAR ) . In addition , contain part CD28 OX40 gene stimulate T cell make live long . Investigators find CAR-T cell kill tumor , n't last long body tumor eventually come back . T cell recognize virus cause chicken pox , varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) , remain bloodstream many year especially stimulate boosted VZV vaccine . Investigators therefore insert GD2-CAR gene T cell recognize VZV . These cell call iC9-GD2-CAR-VZV-specific T cell refer GD2-T cell simplicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients give blood make GD2-T cell grown frozen . To get GD2-CAR attach surface T-cell , gene insert T-cell . As described Brief Summary , gene contains GD2-CAR . This do use part virus ( know retrovirus ) put vector make study carry antibody gene T cell . This retrovirus vector also help identify T cell patient 's blood inject . Because patient receive cell new gene follow total 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . When enrolled study , patient assign one two group different dos GD2-T cell . The first group patient receive low dose GD2-T cell . Once dose schedule prove safe , next group patient start high dose . Before receive dose GD2-T cell , receive dose VZV vaccine . This give injection skin take less minute . Within two day later patient give injection GD2-T cell vein IV line assign dose . Before injection receive , dose Benadryl Tylenol may give . The injection take 1 25 minute . After injection patient follow clinic 4 hour . The treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital . The patient may need stay Houston 4 week infusion monitor side effect . We follow patient clinic communication primary doctor GD2-T-cell injection . Medical test treatment -- Before treated , patient receive series standard medical test : - Physical exam - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function - Measurements tumor routine imaging study . We use image study use follow patient 's tumor ( Computer Tomogram ( CT ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , Positron Emission Tomography ( PET/CT ) Medical test treatment -- Patients receive standard medical test get infusion afterwards : - Physical exam - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function - Measurements tumor routine imaging study 6 week infusion To learn way GD2-T cell work long last body , extra amount blood , base patient 's weight , maximum 60 ml ( 12 teaspoon ) blood take day GD2-T- cell infusion ( ) , ( end T-cell infusion ( ) ) , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 week GD2-T-cell infusion ( ) every 3 month 1 year , 15 month 18 month , every 6 month 4 year , yearly total 15 year . One additional blood sample might draw 3 4 day GD2-T-cell infusion ( ) ; optional . Blood may draw additional time point base patient 's response treatment . During time point list , Tcells find patient 's blood certain amount , extra 5ml blood may need collect additional testing . For child , total amount blood drawn 3 ml ( le 1 teaspoon ) per 2.2 lb body weight one day . This volume consider safe , may decrease patient anemic ( low red blood cell count ) .</detailed_description>
