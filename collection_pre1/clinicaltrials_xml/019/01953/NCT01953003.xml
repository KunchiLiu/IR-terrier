	<brief_summary>Options treatment patient progress anthracycline taxane limit . Capecitabine currently role setting , yet many 80 % patient respond treatment respond eventually develop clinical resistance . The antitumour activity vinflunine demonstrate patient breast cancer exposure anthracycline taxane . Vinflunine plus capecitabine show feasible combination patient previously treat anthracycline taxane . Each drug combination administer efficacious dos . This population therapeutic option establish clinical benefit . The development new regimen potential new standard care group important . - Primary objective : • compare patient advance breast cancer pretreated anthracycline taxane efficacy combination vinflunine capecitabine capecitabine alone , term progression-free survival . - Secondary objective : - evaluate response rate , time response duration response arm - compare disease control rate arm - evaluate duration disease control arm - evaluate overall survival arm - evaluate safety Methodology This multicentre , open-label , randomise , Phase III study enrol total 334 patient advanced breast cancer previously treat anthracycline taxane . Patients randomise 1:1 ratio receive VFL plus capecitabine ( Arm A ) capecitabine alone ( Arm B ) .</brief_summary>
