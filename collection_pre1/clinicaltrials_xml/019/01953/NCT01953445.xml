	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study effect paclitaxel combine phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor BKM120 patient stage II III breast cancer describe estrogen receptor-positive , human epidermal growth factor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative endocrine therapy resistant . Drugs paclitaxel stop growth tumor block cancer cell division . PI3K inhibitor BKM120 inhibit enzymes need cell growth may improve response endocrine resistant tumor treatment . Giving paclitaxel PI3K inhibitor BKM120 surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
