	<brief_summary>This study Phase I , two-part , open-label study design evaluate effect repeat dos GSK2586184 pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Simvastatin Rosuvastatin healthy volunteer ( Cohort A ) , evaluate pharmacokinetics new tablet formulation GSK2586184 healthy male volunteer ( Cohort B ) . Cohort A single sequence drug interaction study 28 subject ( 14 female 14 male subject ) enrol . Each subject receive single dos Simvastatin Rosuvastatin two occasion , alone follow administration repeat dos GSK2586184 . Cohort B 3-way crossover PK study 9 male subject randomize ( 3 subject treatment sequence ) . Each subject receive single dose standard formulation GSK2586184 food two dose new formulation GSK2586184 , food fast state , accord treatment sequence , 3-day wash dos . The primary aim study investigate effect GSK2586184 pharmacokinetics 2 statin assess impact dose without food new formulation GSK2586184 tablet .</brief_summary>

Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include Investigator consultation GSK Medical Monitor agree document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Subjects Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) , Hematocrit ( HCT ) , White blood cell ( WBC ) , neutrophil platelet value outside normal range always exclude enrolment . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) within range 18 30 Kilogram per meter square ( kg/m^2 ) ( inclusive ) . For Cohort A , female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential , define : Premenopausal female document tubal ligation , tubal occlusion procedure follow hysterosalpingogram confirm bilateral tubal occlusion , bilateral salpingectomy hysterectomy [ `` documented '' refers outcome investigator's/designee 's review subject 's medical history study eligibility , obtain via verbal interview subject subject 's medical record ] ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milliinternational unit per milliliter mIU/mL estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/milliliter ( pg/mL ) ( &lt; 147 picomole/liter confirmatory ] . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method : Condom plus partner use highly effective contraceptive abstinence , define sexual inactivity consistent preferred usual lifestyle subject . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication least 2 week last dose . Normal creatinine clearance value screen ( calculate serum creatinine predict equation use CockcroftGault formula ) , normal serum creatinine value define local reference laboratory , normal urine microscopy significant proteinuria dipstick test . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 x Upper Limit Normal [ ULN ] ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Based average QT duration correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) value triplicate ECGs obtain brief recording period : QTcF &lt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) ; QTcF &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Criteria Based Upon Medical Histories Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 g alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer , 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) 80 proof distil spirit . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Subjects take statin and/or Organic AnionTransporting Polypeptide ( OATP ) Breast Cancer Resistance Protein ( BCRP ) sensitive substrate ( e.g . rapaglinide ) 4 week prior screen . A live vaccination within 4 week first dose study medication , live vaccination plan course study ( completion followup visit ) . For Cohort A : Any subject receive allogeneic bone marrow transplant must exclude . Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessments A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen Urinary cotinine level indicative smoke history regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 6 month prior screen . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . Glycosylated Haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) result &gt; 6.5 % ( 48 mmol/mol ) A positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day .</criteria>
