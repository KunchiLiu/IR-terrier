	<brief_summary>The purpose study look difference way heart function people pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) near normal right ventricle ( RV ) function people pulmonary hypertension impair RV function . The right ventricle chamber heart pump blood pulmonary artery ( artery carry blood heart lung ) . Learning heart work people pulmonary hypertension may help researcher understand good treat pulmonary hypertension prevent disease get bad . To , use two image technique , MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) PET/CT ( Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography ) . MRI use strong magnet radio wave take picture heart . A PET/CT scan combine PET CT scan one machine . A CT scan use x-0rays take 3-day picture inside body , PET scan measure small amount radiation dye call `` tracer '' inject vein . You give two tracer part PET/CT scan . A tracer special type dye small amount radioactivity . The tracer use study call [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) [ 11C ] -acetate . In order take part study , must also agree take part companion study . In companion study , try learn whether drug ranolazine safe effective people PH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Look Way Heart Functions People With Pulmonary Hypertension ( PH ) Who Have Near Normal Right Ventricle ( RV ) Function People With Pulmonary Hypertension Who Have Impaired RV Function . Using Imaging Studies PET Scan Cardiac MRI .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically , RV failure describe stereotyped response hemodynamic overload . More recent large patient cohort data suggest RV , independently Pulmonary Arterial Pressure ( PAP ) , predict mortality . Thus , recent hypothesis suggest individual genetic difference dysregulate cardiomyocyte function , , predispose RV failure human , control patient-specific manifestation disease , thus would represent key diagnostic marker therapeutic target . In fact , multiple key metabolic regulatory factor find alter RV failure , one could contribute individual predisposition RV failure . Based established function leave ventricular injury metabolism19 know alteration right ventricular failure20 , propose evaluate metabolic dysfunction RV use positron emission topography ( PET ) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) .</detailed_description>
