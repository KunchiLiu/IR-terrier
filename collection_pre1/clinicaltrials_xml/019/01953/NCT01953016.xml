	<brief_summary>Background : - People primary immune deficiency disease ( PIDD ) weak immune system . This make hard body fight infection . The Immune Deficiency Foundation network collect data people PIDD . It call United States Immunodeficiency Network . It help doctor scientist well understand disorder . The goal get medical data everyone disorder U.S. Canada . Data store registry . Researchers use study disorder increase . They also learn disorder diagnose treat . Objectives : - To collect data people primary immune deficiency disorder . Eligibility : - People PIDD , carrier one . Design : - Data add record personal identity . - Data add identity kept separate . This data link registry code number . - Data registry include : - Family history - Disease treatment - Disease characteristic - Medical history - Laboratory data</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Participation Research Registry Immune Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol provide resource clinical laboratory research enrollment know immunodeficiency patient national registry , US Immunodeficiency Network ( USIDNET ) . The registry data expand NIH nation knowledge base immune deficiency disorder genetic mutation lead disorder . Additional registrant NIH protocol increase understand molecular basis disorder , also serve document track incidence progression complication . Objectives specific aim The purpose proposal create mechanism deposit NIH data USIDNET . The patient Registry design obtain longitudinal data large number patient primary immunodeficiency disease , genetic carrier defect order : - Learn phenotypic variation see large number individual patient rare molecular diagnosis . - Determine natural history genetic disorder immunity establish genotype-phenotype correlation . - Learn effect various treatment protocol use patient time , include unexpected side effect may unique particular diagnostic group . - To evaluate quality life use standard tool correlate genotype treatment history . - To promote collaborative research amongst interested investigator identify large pool potential research subject would available institution - To identify patient specific diagnosis potential participation multi-institutional clinical trial design diagnosis therapy specific disease .</detailed_description>
