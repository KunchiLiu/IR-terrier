	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess efficacy safety vintafolide alone compare vintafolide plus paclitaxel paclitaxel alone participants 100 % positive folate receptor ( FR ) triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . The primary hypothesis study vintafolide alone and/or vintafolide + paclitaxel improve progression free survival ( PFS ) participant FR ( 100 % ) TNBC compare paclitaxel alone .</brief_summary>
