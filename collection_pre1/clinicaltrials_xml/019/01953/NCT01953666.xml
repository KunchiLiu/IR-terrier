	<brief_summary>Computers play important role live individuals.Access computer crucial people disability may improve quality life . The use computer facilitate mainstreaming school , example , Internet may provide valuable mean communication . However , use computer require certain degree motor ability . People motor disability frequently experience difficulty use standard keyboard standard point input system mouse . Many solution exist facilitate computer access , depend person 's specific impairment purpose computer use . The common solution relies use virtual keyboard directly display computer screen . The selection desire key virtual keyboard handle large variety input device , microgravity mouse single switch device supplement process dynamic scan keyboard.Although assistive device render computer accessible people disability , actual inputting text slow . A method increase text input speed display word predict letter previously type . Word prediction reduces number necessary key stroke avoid type whole word . The effect text input speed , however uncertain result literature inconclusive . Indeed , word prediction software provide enhancement cognitive load decrease text input speed.The reduction cognitive load could therefore base part optimization setting software / achievement rehabilitation program.Our hypothesis people spinal cord injury : ) optimization setting word prediction software ii ) rehabilitation program could improve text input speed.The investigator propose study influence setting word prediction software text input speed influence rehabilitation program provide therapist , focus word prediction software help integrate . The aim increase performance people spinal cord injury satisfaction . The first phase research select word prediction software configuration provide best user support.The second phase corresponds objective evaluate efficiency rehabilitation program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficiency Word Prediction Software Text Input Speed Tetraplegia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PHASE 1 : The first phase study repeat measurement efficiency type text topic various situation . Each subject copy text different test random order . Similarly , word prediction software capacity self-improvement internal dictionary , disabled . investigator study one set configuration word prediction software . Are available length list proposal three option select : 1 , 3 5 word , accord literature result questionnaire.This questionnaire sent identify use people spinal cord injury professional word prediction software . The list word upper position screen base result questionnaire . Four combination test subject . Twelve Tetraplegics require group ( one group use virtual keyboard one group use physical keyboard ) Each combination try 10 minute . PHASE 2 : The second phase evaluate effeciency rehabilitation program reduce cognitive load generate software prediction word . The investigator propose evaluation effect 12 training session control , randomize , three parallel group ( experimental group : rehabilitation program , group : self-learning group : learning ) . Text input test perform training session people rehabilitation program . For two group , review one month first test . For evaluation , different text difficulty use . The order execution randomize . At end month three group evaluate accord procedure firts test .</detailed_description>
