	<brief_summary>Cocaine use disorder affect approximately 1.5 million Americans annually . Currently , US Food Drug Administration approve medication treatment cocaine dependence ; however , animal human study suggest medication affect noradrenergic system reduce cocaine craving use . The investigator study effect doxazosin , alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist , reduce cocaine use anxiety symptom among cocaine-dependent individual . In addition , investigator identify genetic subpopulation participant preferentially respond medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenetic Trial Doxazosin Treatment Cocaine Abuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The noradrenergic system , especially alpha 1-adrenergic receptor , may play important role cocaine addiction human . Doxazosin long-acting selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker , inhibit bind norepinephrine alpha receptor autonomic nervous system . This study evaluate efficacy doxazosin reduce cocaine-using behavior treatment seek cocaine-dependent individual , guide future pharmacotherapy trial use Doxazosin relate alpha 1 receptor antagonist treatment cocaine addiction . Additionally , study identify genetic subpopulation participant doxazosin preferentially effective , specifically examine R492C functional polymorphism ADRA1A gene . This 15-week double-blind , placebo control clinical trial provide treatment 100 cocaine-dependent patient include 13 week medication trial ( week 1-13 ) 2 week washout period ( week 14-15 ) . Qualifying subject randomize receive Doxazosin 8 mg/day , placebo study participation . Subjects receive 2 mg study medication/placebo capsule week 1 , 2mg/week induction rate 3 week , accord randomized assignment , maintain agent week 13 . During course trial , participant receive manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy . At end study ( week 14-15 ) , participant undergo discontinuation active/placebo medication 2-week period . Subjects wish transfer appropriate treatment program treatment-research program help referral 2 week period ( week 14-15 ) .</detailed_description>
