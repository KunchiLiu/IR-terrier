	<brief_summary>This research evaluate effectiveness new drug call belatacept ( Nulojix ) prevention acute rejection preservation kidney function transplant patient . Belatacept approve 2011 United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) market Nulojix . The pharmaceutical company sponsor study Bristol-Myers Squibb . Belatacept prescription medicine use adult prevent transplant rejection people receive kidney transplant . Transplant rejection happen body 's immune system sense new transplanted kidney different foreign , attack . Belatacept use corticosteroid certain medicine help prevent rejection new kidney . The purpose research understand whether new drug , belatacept , good anti-rejection drug , cyclosporine tacrolimus typically use treatment kidney rejection transplant patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Belatacept Effect Alloimmunity Antiviral Response After Kidney Transplantation ( BMS IM 103-309 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Hypothesis : Switching belatacept-based immunosuppression regimen kidney transplant significant impact antibody T cell-mediated immune response compare control patient measure peripheral blood 6 month belatacept switch comparable safety efficacy compare calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) base regimen . Primary Objective : To analyze effect switch CNI belatacept patient evidence CNI toxicity development maintenance immune memory response alloantigen viral antigen commonly encounter transplant , assess safety efficacy conversion belatacept maintenance immunosuppression combination prednisone mycophenolate mofetil . Study Design : Open label , single center clinical trial . Patients evidence CNI toxicity eligible switch belatacept-based regimen within first three month transplant . All enrolled subject also receive concomitant maintenance immunosuppression mycophenolate mofetil corticosteroid . Duration Study : 6 month , option extend 12 month belatacept treatment Number Subjects : 20 Study Population : Kidney transplant recipient within first three month first transplant evidence CNI toxicity . Criteria Evaluation : Primary Outcome Measures : - Donor specific antibody test Month 6 - Cell surface cytokine secretion response donor cell antigen direct indirect stimulation Month 6 - Cell surface cytokine secretion response CMV EBV antigens direct indirect stimulation Month 6 - Immunophenotyping determine overall immune profile Month 6 - Patient functional graft survival stable renal transplant recipient Secondary Outcome Measures : - Donor specific antibody testing Months 1 3 ( month 12 continue study ) - Cell surface cytokine secretion response donor cell antigen direct indirect stimulation Months 1 3 ( month 12 continue study ) - Cell surface cytokine secretion response CMV EBV antigens direct indirect stimulation Months 1 3 ( month 12 continue study ) Test Product , Dose Mode Administration , Duration Treatment : Study patient receive intravenous belatacept 5mg/kg every two week day 1 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , monthly month 3 , 4 , 5 . At month 6 patient may elect continue additional six month period belatacept administration . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) serum antibody test collected time study entry 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 week belatacept start , frozen bank center , analyzed batch fashion development humoral cell mediate immunity . Patients elect receive additional 6 month belatacept treatment undergo additional immunologic analysis 1 year study entry .</detailed_description>
