	<brief_summary>During period rehabilitation important select meaningful test ; measure want , responsive change patient 's condition , easy use clinical setting . With amputee test may help make sure rehabilitation programme prosthesis ( artificial leg ) provide tailor individual . New prosthetic technology continually develop active amputee demand artificial limb . Making sure get right rehabilitation programme appropriate prosthesis help perform best . Twenty low limb amputee artificial limb least one year recruit study . They ask complete 2 walking test 4 questionnaire measure different aspect condition comfort socket perceive ability undertake everyday task . Each test give score grade represent level ability , judge test , give time point . The test repeat second occasion seven ten day first . By measure change score two occasion hop index reliability establish particular test show widely use Health Professional involve rehabilitation amputee across UK . It also hop minimal detectable change ( MDC ) also calculated test . By understand MDC test anyone use able know whether change score detect real change due change patient 's ability chance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome Measures Lower Limb Amputees - A Repeatability Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Outcome Measures ( test ) use study identify survey Health Professionals across UK . The top 5 use : SIGAM Mobility Grades The Special Interest Group Amputee Medicine ( SIGAM ) Mobility Grades describe single-item scale amputee mobility . A self-reported questionnaire 21 yes/no item answer apply algorithm final grade assign . There 8 grade assign . Timed go ( TUAG ) The TUAG test standardise quantitative measure manoeuvre require 'basic mobility ' . The subject time stand chair , walk 3m , turn return chair . The score time , second , take complete circuit . 2 Minute Walk Test A time walk test often use measure functional exercise capacity . Participants instruct walk end end enclose quiet corridor , cover much ground possible two minute . The score distance walk metre . Locomotor Capability Index LCI-5 ) The Locomotor Capability Index ( LCI-5 ) self-administered scale specifically design use lower limb amputee . It 14 question locomotor activity . The answer require either yes question phrase : `` Would say able follow activity prosthesis ? '' The total score activity total possible maximum score 56 . Socket Comfort Score This score subjective measure comfortable amputee feel socket time score take . Amputees ask standard question : 'On 0 - 10 scale , 0 represent uncomfortable socket fit imagine , 10 represent comfortable socket fit , would score comfort socket fit artificial limb moment ? '' Their response 11 point scale record . Finally EQ-5D™ administer . The EQ-5D™ self-administered , standardised instrument measure health outcome . It provide simple descriptive profile single index participant health status time test . At first Test Visit ( TV1 ) write consent obtain amputee Researcher amputee enrol study participant . Baseline measurement test also take visit well basic demographic data record age , cause amputation , level amputation relevant concomitant medical history . This study utilise test-retest methodology Test Visit 2 ( TV2 ) occur within 7 10 day TV1 test repeat . Every effort make complete test time day participant 's study visit order measurement randomly assign visit .</detailed_description>
