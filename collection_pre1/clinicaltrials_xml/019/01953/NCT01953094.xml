	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine possibility compliance perform anal Pap smear Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) DNA test woman high grade low genital tract dysplasia cervical cancer determine prevalence anal dysplasia population use high-resolution anoscopy ( HRA ) . In addition , do potentially develop screening , diagnostic treatment protocol anal dysplasia woman high-grade low genital tract dysplasia cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Overlooked Population Risk AIN .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anal cancer incidence increase although woman compose half case HPV relate low genital tract dysplasia/malignancy even great risk screen currently recommend . We therefore propose perform prospective cohort study determine prevalence anal dysplasia woman high-grade low genital tract dysplasia use high-resolution anoscopy HRA . This potentially lead development screening , diagnosis treatment schema implement woman high-grade low genital tract dysplasia . This study potentially high impact health delivery woman high risk anal cancer transform current treatment anal cancer preventive screen program . This later implement throughout Ontario center treat woman cervical dysplasia . The incidence anal intraepithelial neoplasm ( AIN also know anal cancer ) increase Ontario last 20 year . Two-thirds case find woman . The average time diagnosis anal cancer previous cervical dysplasia cancer approximately 20 year . This study give opportunity detect treat pre-invasive lesion potentially prevent development anal cancer . Currently , screen , diagnosis treatment recommendation anal dysplasia find woman high-grade low genital tract dysplasia .</detailed_description>
