	<brief_summary>This research trial study gene expression patient prostate cancer spread place body receive cytochrome P450 17 alpha hydroxylase/17,20 lyase ( CYP-17 ) inhibition therapy . Studying sample tissue , blood , urine laboratory patient receive CYP-17 inhibition therapy may help doctor learn change occur deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Expression Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Receiving CYP-17 Inhibition Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether somatic tumor genome alteration identify tumor tissue initiation CYP-17 inhibition abiraterone acetate therapy associate 12-week composite progression free survival ( PFS ) endpoint . II . To use tumor tissue obtain prior initiation therapy 12 week biopsy develop tumor xenograft mechanistic functional study determine whether mutation identify tumor genome associate response drug target observe mutated gene and/or associate pathway . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether somatic tumor genome alteration identify initiate CYP-17 inhibition abiraterone acetate therapy associate overall survival . II . To determine whether somatic tumor genome alteration identify tumor tissue initiation CYP-17 inhibition abiraterone acetate therapy associate progression free survival ( PFS ) . III . To evaluate circulatory marker blood urine specimen response and/or resistance treatment . ( Exploratory correlative objective ) OUTLINE : Tissue , blood , urine sample collect baseline 12-14 week treatment assess circulate tumor cell , genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) , exome sequencing .</detailed_description>
