	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate safety muscle progenitor cell ( MPCs ) treatment urinary incontinence due incompetent outlet ( bladder neck/urethra ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscle Progenitor Cell Therapy Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subject diagnosis urinary incontinence give consent take part undergo biopsy muscle inner thigh anesthesia . The muscle sample culture expand approximately 6 week . The product , compose autologous , ex vivo-expanded muscle progenitor cell ( MPCs ) suspension , deliver via target injection bladder neck sphincter region use either endoscopic needle via cystoscope periurethral injection ultrasound guidance . All subject follow 1 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month post-injection .</detailed_description>
