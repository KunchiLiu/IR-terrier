	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study radiation therapy cisplatin without surgery treating patient stage III-IV oropharyngeal cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether radiation therapy cisplatin effective without surgery treating patient oropharyngeal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Cisplatin With Without Surgery Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine primary treatment transoral endoscopic head neck surgery improve progression free survival ( PFS ) patient human papilloma virus negative ( HPV- ) oropharyngeal cancer ( OPC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare patterns failure ( local-regional relapse versus distant ) survival ( overall progression-free ) . II . To determine safety efficacy ( rate positive surgical margin ) use transoral robotic surgery patient T3 tumor tonsil , tongue-base , glossopharyngeal sulcus . III . To compare head neck cancer-specific quality life ( QOL ) short-term ( &lt; 6 month ) long-term ( 2 year ) relate swallow function . IV . To compare subjective ( patient report ) objective ( physiologic ) measure swallow function short-term long-term . V. To assess effect neck dissection shoulder function use validated QOL instrument patient undergo neck dissection VI . To assess correlation physician derive clinical target volume ( CTV 's ) locoregional control failure . VII . To determine whether specific molecular profile associate overall progression-free survival clinical endpoint . VIII . To determine sensitivity specificity pre-treatment compute tomography ( CT ) scan detect presence lymph node extracapsular extension examine surgically dissect lymph node . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo transoral endoscopic head neck surgery ( eHNS ) . Depending post-operative pathology finding , patient may undergo intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) daily ( QD ) five day week 6 week . High-risk patient also receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 radiation therapy . ARM II : Patients undergo IMRT QD five day week 7 week . Patients also receive cisplatin IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 radiation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
