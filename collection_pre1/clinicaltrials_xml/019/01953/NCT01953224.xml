	<brief_title>STEP AND GO : A Study Technology-based Exercise Promotion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity reduce cardiometabolic risk factor . Unfortunately , majority adult meet activity recommendation . Though walking preferred method activity proven effectiveness , motivate sustained adherence activity goal difficult . `` Gamification '' use technology-based tool hold promise motivating increase adherence physical activity goal . Gamification occur element video game ( leaderboards , badge , progression virtual narrative ) integrate non-game application . Game element may motivate fast , long , and/or frequent walk make walk self-monitoring enjoyable . In proposed research investigator seek test feasibility acceptability technology-based intervention `` gamifies '' physical activity use technology . The investigator randomize 40 inactive overweight adult ( 20 woman , age 18 - 69 ) either intervention group wait-list control . ( Note : 10 additional participant recruit pre-pilot one-arm test intervention ensure mobile device , cellular service , game , etc . work correctly . ) The intervention consist primarily provision mobile device load narrative-based walking application ( `` app '' ) . Participants instruct use app achieve activity goal increase 60 150 minute per week . The app us global position system accelerometry track exercise duration intensity . Investigators call participant weekly brief counsel technical support . The intervention last 12 week . Primary outcome process measure feasibility acceptability , include attrition , reason drop-out , adherence use app , exposure call , adverse event . The investigator also compare behavioral ( physical activity ) , weight-related ( weight , body composition ) , health outcome ( fitness , blood pressure ) intervention group wait-list control . Finally , theory-based intermediate variable , self-efficacy , intrinsic motivation , self-regulation , also investigate . This study provide crucial information regard promise gamified apps lay foundation large research program technology-based cardiovascular health promotion .</detailed_description>
