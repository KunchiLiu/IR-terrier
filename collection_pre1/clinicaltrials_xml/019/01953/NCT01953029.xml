	<brief_title>Mechanisms Myocardial Infarction Women With Non Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause death woman . Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) usually characterize sudden erosion endothelial wall rupture plaque.However , woman ACS less likely men either classic symptom obstructive coronary artery disease paradoxically bad prognosis . Different data literature indicate may different pathophysiological mechanism , afflict men woman somewhat differently.Between 5 % 30 % patient ACS undergo coronary angiography find non visible non obstructive coronary disease ( NOCD ) . This 2-3 time common woman men . Several pathogenetic mechanism myocardial infarction ( MI ) absence obstructive coronary artery disease ( OCD ) postulate , include among others atherosclerosis plaque disruption lead luminal occlusion , endothelial dysfunction , vasospasm , distal microembolization microvascular dysfunction . However data extremely limited .</detailed_description>
