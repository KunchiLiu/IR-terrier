	<detailed_description>Background Altitude related medical problem gain importance attention ever increase number people travel high altitude work pleasure . Resort town Europe Western United States elevation 2000 3000 range attract million visitor annually . Many visit city South America Asia situate 3000 m. In addition , tens thousand traveler , trekker , skier worldwide ascend elevation range 3000 5500 m. An ever-increasing number recreational climber attempt ascent summit high ( 3500 5500 ) extreme ( &gt; 5500 ) altitude . The Nepalese Ministry Tourism Civil Aviation Nepal Mountaineering Association report issue permit 6032 climber peak high 6000 year 2010 alone . When consider number people reside high altitude bound increase , importance deepen understand physiologic change danger associate exposure high altitude . Oxygen homeostasis essential survival healthy human high altitude . Various physiological change involve different organ system occur exposition acclimatization hypobaric hypoxia context high altitude sojourn . These include marked adaptation pulmonary systemic vascular function , change cerebral perfusion metabolism , physiologic metabolic adaptation immune system innate defense mechanism infection . These change consequence tissue hypoxia per se mediate hypoxia induce activation sympathoadrenal pathway . An example important research activity recent year discovery hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha ( HIF1Î± ) role oxygen homoeostasis regulation multiple gene locus . Additionally , result hypoxia induce increase oxidative/reductive stress , enhance generation reactive oxygen ( ROS ) nitrogen specie ( RNS ) , altered activity antioxidant system , related oxidative damage lipid , protein , DNA occur well injury cellular , sub-cellular molecular level . These short-lived intermediate include among others superoxide anion ( O2 ) , hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) , hypochloride ( HOCI . In addition , hydroxyl radical ( OH ) , hydroxide ion ( OH ) superoxide radical ( O2- ) highly reactive member ROS family accumulate certain physiological pathophysiological condition . As consequence , prolong hypobaric hypoxia lead systemic oxidative stress similar severe inflammation . Tissue hypoxia increase oxidative stress well adaptive reactive change sympathoadrenal neuroendocrine process also occur various disease state . Hypoxia per se play important role pathogenesis major cause mortality , include cancer , cerebral myocardial ischemia , chronic heart lung disease . Global hypoxemia common problem critically ill patient : In patient pulmonary failure profound hypoxia occur due ventilation/perfusion mismatch impair diffusion capacity across alveolo-capillary membrane despite best medical support include mechanical ventilation . Oxygen delivery tissue might also impair due low cardiac output reduce oxygen carry capacity anemia . Microcirculatory dysfunction - occur context severe sepsis - lead local hypoxia cellular level even patient normal increase arterial oxygen content oxygen delivery . In critically ill patient cellular hypoxia induces oxidative stress deplete cellular antioxidative capacity lead impaired ability use available oxygen . Depleted level reduce glutathione , important intra-mitochondrial antioxidant , combination increase generation ROS RNS seem inhibit oxidative phosphorylation ATP generation . There increase interest ROS-intermediates role progression modulation vascular dysfunction remodelling see different chronic disease entity , diabetes mellitus , chronic heart failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) development pulmonary hypertension ( PHT ) . The mechanisms ROS-generation fully understand . ROS produce leukocyte , generation ROS might also occur disruption electron transport chain mitochondrion . The result mitochondrial dysfunction describe additional factor cause pulmonary vasoconstriction remodelling PHT . In hypoxic patient respiratory failure increase pulmonary vascular pressure frequently occur ( WHO Class III - pulmonary hypertension ) may worsen hypoxemia impair lung perfusion . If increase cause direct vasoconstrictive effect hypoxia pulmonary endothelial cell increase ROS still fully understood . Generally , mechanism lead adaptation prolong hypoxic condition healthy human critically ill patient well understood . In context critical illness mechanism difficult explore due heterogeneity patient precipitate illness . Furthermore , effect hypoxia concur disease related process difficult impossible distinguish . Animal model critical illness might substantial limitation often represent human patient . It suggest physiological pathophysiological response hypobaric hypoxia may similar response see critical illness . In context high altitude expedition human subject safely submit prolonged hypoxia oxidative stress result cerebral , cardiovascular pulmonary adaptation change mitochondrial function , inflammatory cascade , coagulatory activity explore controlled fashion . The study human response hypoxia occur hypobaric environment healthy volunteer ascend high altitude may therefore serve model isolate hypoxia might help improve understanding effect critically ill patient . Objective The aim project `` High Altitude Medical Research Expedition Himlung 2013 '' ( HiReach2013 ) comprehensively investigate cerebral , cardiovascular pulmonary adaptation reaction human coagulation system ascent extreme altitude 7000 m. Methods Cardiopulmonary exercise test do use test system bicycle use roller trainer standardization regulation work load . Static dynamic lung volume assess study site . The measurement include assessment DLCO use commercially available spirometer . Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography perform assessment systolic/diastolic cardiac function pulmonary artery pressure . Lung ultrasound apply subject study site quantify extravascular lung water ultrasound lung comet . Microparticle measurement perform use Annexin V base ELISA . Cerebral blood flow velocity measure middle cerebral artery use transcranial Doppler . Structural cerebral change cerebral volume assess MRI brain . At study site extensive coagulation study perform .</detailed_description>
