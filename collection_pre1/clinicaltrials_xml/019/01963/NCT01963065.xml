	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether baby expose significant level chemical stay neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . For example , research study show baby expose plasticizer ( bisphenol A , phthalates ) NICU . Plasticizers chemical use make plastic medical equipment soft flexible . The research team want find whether amount plasticizer chemical baby may expose NICU make difference grow perform neurologic test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Significance Premature newborn may particularly vulnerable effect toxic chemical environment small body size , immature hepatic renal clearance mechanism , rapid rate development . Approximately 8 % neonate United States require admission level II III NICU follow birth ; thus 300,000 infant annually expose chemical-intensive hospital environment developmentally vulnerable period . Neonates treat NICU elevate risk developmental delay , cognitive dysfunction , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , autism partially explain degree prematurity severity clinical disease . Lesions find neuroimaging relatively insensitive predictor long-term cognitive behavioral outcome . Moreover , many medical condition associate prematurity , chronic lung disease retinopathy prematurity , incompletely predict gestational age birth severity newborn illness . We hypothesize portion neurocognitive , social , somatic impairment see NICU graduate attributable potentially preventable NICU-based exposure . As NICU care mature , survival likely premature infant . Our research emphasis therefore shift survival develop method improve long term growth development patient . We believe research strategy must examine potential contribution chemical exposure occur NICU stay predictor neurodevelopmental outcome . All subject propose study care NICU - therefore comparison internally valid . While finding may generalizable non-NICU population , potential positive impact work thousand NICU graduate make work high impact public health priority . We focus low birth weight ( VLBW ) infants infant generally experience much third trimester developmental window ex utero NICU . Studies utero chemical exposure indicate vulnerability developmentally immature individual developmental window . It therefore logical ass whether ex utero exposure occur NICU act similarly . Additionally , small cross-sectional study indicate high exposure level face NICU inpatient . Both propose study continuation line research future study , plan characterize role hospital-based chemical exposure neurodevelopment NICU graduate . 2 . Preliminary Studies Innovation Substantial information health effect community-based early life exposure , well presence NICU environment , exist chemical interest study . Numerous material use NICU care , incubator , respiratory support device , intravenous ( IV ) enteral feeding supply , make plastic act vehicle chemical exposure . Phthalates - chemical use make plastic flexible resilient - common medical material . Bisphenol A ( BPA ) contaminate metal also present plastic material . Silver add plastic IV catheter component antimicrobial . Parenteral nutrition ( PN ) , frequently administer long duration NICU , contain Mn . Surprisingly , little evidence support safety total dose Mn add PN , grow body literature suggest Mn toxicity may occur among NICU patient . Exposure chemical may associate significant systemic neurodevelopmental impairment , however , impact neurodevelopment NICU graduate largely unstudied . 3 . Chemical Childhood Outcome Associated Early Life Exposure Evidence Exposure Evolving evidence suggest chemical non-chemical stressor NICU may impact infant neurodevelopment . The built environment , ambient noise , in-hospital parent-child interaction , parental stress NICU stay associate altered neurodevelopment among NICU graduate . Socioeconomic factor psychological functioning primary caregiver also link childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes generally . These factor must therefore consider confounders and/or modifier comprehensive NICU neurodevelopmental outcome association study . 4 . Study Goals Plan This study identify specific source chemical exposure among NICU inpatient explore association exposure neurodevelopmental outcomes . Overall , use research portion career development award identify chemical target neurodevelopmental assessment protocols PI 's subsequent R01 application ( ) . The propose study identify prevalence dose chemical NICU inpatient expose provide pilot data association neurodevelopmental outcome . In year four , PI use data basis first R01 application generate cohort NICU graduate exposure dose timing quantify neurophenotypes measure infancy childhood . We pick small number candidate chemical exposure know likely , negative neurodevelopmental impact community exposure document , health implication NICU-based exposure unknown . Prior study document numerous phthalate-containing material NICU elevate biomarkers phthalates BPA NICU inpatient . These study limit cross-sectional specimen sample , patient enrollment without attention factor likely affect chemical metabolism include gestational chronologic age severity illness , small sample size . To knowledge , biomarkers NICU-exposure Ag , Cd , Mn assess , despite document presence metal NICU know adverse health outcome relate early life exposure . No previous study NICU chemical exposure consider important potential confounders/modifiers chemical toxicant impact consider propose study . The propose study also develop novel clinical exposure assessment tool , NICU Exposure Checklist ( NICE-Check ) . Using detailed biomarker analysis couple prospective assessment contact medical material duration NICU hospitalization , hope define association intensity exposure specific medical material chemical biomarker level . This type association preliminarily note incompletely characterize Green et al . pilot study phthalate exposure NICU . ( 54 ) Development validation NICE-Check , novel , rapid , accurate , cost-effective chemical exposure assessment tool , would allow preliminary identification source chemical exposure could potentially remove , facilitate future large study hospital-based chemical exposure . This would particularly valuable screen tool field , exposure biomarker test large number chemical prohibitively expensive study . To knowledge , relationship biomarkers exposure chemical NICU specific care practice explore . Additionally , potential association NICU-based chemical exposure neurodevelopmental deficit evaluate . Two study assess outcomes related NICU phthalate exposure , neither used exposure biomarkers validate exposure assessment method characterize initial exposure consider important non-chemical confounders . The propose study address limitation comprehensive , longitudinal evaluation chemical exposure NICU design evaluate environmental chemical exposure clinical outcome vulnerable population . This study also assess psychosocial stressor NICU co-occur chemical exposure could modulate/confound outcome assessment . This study 's success aid interdisciplinary nature bring together neonatologists ( include PI ) NICU staff ( include RN leadership ) environmental health scientist ( mentor co-mentors ) .</detailed_description>
