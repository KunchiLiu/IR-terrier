	<detailed_description>SUMMARY OF STUDY PLAN The propose clinical study Phase II , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial adult 65-85 year age evidence cognitive impairment . A total 120 person randomize study , goal complete 100 evaluable subject . At screen assessment , participant complete informed consent ; questionnaire basic demographic information include personal medical history allergy drug compound ; mental ability test call Mini-Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) ; SF-12 Health survey ; Centers Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) distribute instruction form diet survey gastrointestinal questionnaire . At baseline/randomization assessment , study staff ( ) Confirm eligibility base screening test ; ( b ) collect complete diet gastrointestinal questionnaire survey form ; ( c ) collect blood CBC/CMP antioxidant biomarkers ; ( ) battery cognitive test include Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test , Educational Testing Service - Identical Pictures Test , Educational Testing Service - Number Comparison Test , Educational Testing Service - Vocabulary Test , Trailmaking A &amp; B , Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Digit Symbol Test , Wechsler Intelligence Scale - Digit Span , Letter Fluency , Category Fluency . Subjects equally randomize ( n=60 per arm ) blind treatment either NT-020 ( Natura Therapeutics Nutrastem ) match placebo , initial supply study drug dispense . Participants supply one-month supply blind treatment ( n=60/arm ) give study agent intake symptom log form . The planned intervention period 2 month . At specified interval ( week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ) , participant contact inquire correct administration supplement placebo well assess adverse event . At one month ( midpoint ) , participant return campus ( ) collect blood CBC/CMP antioxidant biomarkers , ( b ) collect unused nutritional supplement placebo complete study agent intake symptom log form ; ( c ) collect complete diet survey ; ( ) supply participant new one-month supply nutritional supplement placebo new study agent intake symptom log form . At end intervention ( 2 month ) , ( ) collect blood CBC/CMP antioxidant biomarkers ; ( b ) collect unused nutritional supplement placebo complete study agent intake symptom log form ; ( c ) collect complete diet survey ; ( ) battery cognitive test include Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test , Educational Testing Service - Identical Pictures Test , Educational Testing Service - Number Comparison Test , Educational Testing Service - Vocabulary Test , Trailmaking A &amp; B , Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Digit Symbol Test , Wechsler Intelligence Scale - Digit Span , Letter Fluency , Category Fluency ; ; ( e ) complete eyeblink condition paradigm ; ( f ) complete time interval tap paradigm ; ( g ) Memory Abilities Questionnaire ( MAQ-SR ) ; The primary endpoint study comparison delay eyeblink acquisition performance person placebo intervention arm . Other endpoint include : assessing safety NT-020 propose dose regimen ; investigate effect NT-020 additional measure cognitive performance . An additional exploratory endpoint examine result serum urine diagnostic marker ( C-reactive protein , IL-1B , TNFa ) 2 month intervention nutritional supplement vs. placebo . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Study Design/Endpoints The central hypothesis Phase II clinical trial adult receive NT-020 exhibit fast acquisition delay eyeblink conditioning , compare adult placebo . Sample Size/Accrual Rate We anticipate screen 120 person , randomize 100 , 88 person complete two-month study period . We power analysis repeat measure ANOVA eyeblink condition paradigm . Power estimate .80 ( Î± = .05 ) , assume six block trial acquisition CR , effect size f = .16 group X trial interaction , sample size 44 per group , assume attrition rate 12 % two month period . Randomization Stratification During baseline/randomization visit , subject randomize use stratified randomization method prior intervention utilize web-based randomization system . Primary Endpoints The primary efficacy endpoint compare acquisition delay eyeblink condition person treat NT-020 vs. placebo . The planned intervention period two month . Eyeblink condition outcome examine use 2 ( group ; NT-020 , placebo ) X 6 ( trial ) repeat measure ANOVA examine difference acquisition condition response eyeblink conditioning . Secondary Endpoint ( ) Is facilitation acquisition delay trace human eyeblink response nutritional supplementation group mediate change anti-oxidant marker ? In order examine mediation intervention group effect eyeblink acquisition , adopt Baron Kenny 's approach regression-based statistical mediation . In model , several requirement must satisfy order claim statistical mediation . We examine whether intervention group associate eyeblink acquisition , whether intervention group associate change biomarkers , well critical step whether influence intervention group eyeblink acquisition reduce make statistically significant inclusion change biomarker value regression analysis . Evaluate effect NT-020 treatment change paper pencil measure cognitive performance : A 2 ( time ; baseline , two-months ) X 2 ( group ; NT-020 , placebo ) ANOVA compute cognitive test score . The presence group X time interaction suggest two group exhibit differential change across two time point .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adults 6585 year age ( inclusive ) . Able understand sign inform consent . Native Englishspeaking . No evidence dementia ( MMSE &gt; =23 ) . Each subject must willing give consent inform experimental nature therapy , alternative , potential benefit , sideeffects , risk discomfort . All subject must willing monitor adequacy nutritional intake intervention , current standard clinical practice . Use high dose antioxidant supplement provide trial . History know allergy component study supplement . Mental illness judge PI preclude successful completion trial . Persons native English speaker exclude current proposal many cognitive test administer languagebased heavily influence first language . Other acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make subject inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
