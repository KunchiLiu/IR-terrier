	<brief_summary>Investigating effect non-invasive transcranial current stimulation auditory hallucination patient schizophrenia . Normal neuronal activity perturb schizophrenia , selective target abnormal activity could serve treatment schizophrenia alleviate symptom cause abnormal neuronal activity , auditory hallucination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Current Stimulation Treatment Auditory Hallucinations Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIM 1 : To evaluate effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) ( 2mA 20min five consecutive day ) auditory hallucination schizophrenia patient use change rating Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale ( AHRS ) patient stimulation . We hypothesize tDCS modulate abnormal neuronal activity find schizophrenic patient thereby decrease auditory hallucination measure stimulation . AIM 2 : To evaluate long term effect tDCS patient give rating AHRS one month pass since stimulation compare value baseline score score immediately stimulation . We hypothesize remain significant reduction auditory hallucination score participant receive tDCS one month .</detailed_description>
