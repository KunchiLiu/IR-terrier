	<brief_summary>The Gastric bypass ( GBP ) actually one perform bariatric procedure worldwide . Short term result report 67 % mean Excess Weight Loss ( EWL ) 2 year , 58 % EWL 5 year . Sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) restrictive procedure gain popularity technical simplicity efficiency ( 60 % EWL 1 year 48 % 4 year ) . However , failure observe insufficient weight loss early weight regain . Several hypothesis propose explain failure , size gastric pouch could correlate weight evolution . Purpose study Taking hypothesis progressive dilatation gastric pouch one main factor weight loss failure GBP SG due loss restrictive function , aim study measure gastric volume use gastric tomodensitometry gas , new reliable , precise 3 dimension radiological technique . The investigator try identify positive correlation gastric dilatation weight regain . Methods This 2 year interventional , prospective , monocentric study longitudinal follow-up . Forty-five obese patient ( BMI &gt; 40kg/m² ) eligible primary GBP ( n=25 ) SG ( n=20 ) include . Gastric volume measure gastric tomodensitometry gas 3 12 month surgery . In GBP group , investigator measure gastric pouch volume , candy cane Roux limb volume , neostomach volume ( = gastric pouch+candy cane Roux limb ) gastro-jejunal anastomosis diameter . In SG group , investigator measure volume gastric tube , non resectedantrum , whole residual stomach gastric tube diameter middle small curvature . Volume variation 3 12 month compare EWL clinical metabolic data ( HbA1c , Insulinemia , HOMA index , liver steatosis ) . A 30 % dilatation neostomach 12 month consider significant . Reinhold 's criterion use define surgical failure : EWL &lt; 50 % 12 month . Weight regain consider significant weight reach 12 month high minimum weight obtain . Gastric volume variation , EWL BMI evolution 3rd 12th month analyse whole population group ( GBP SG ) Wilcoxon test . Expected benefit If investigator valid hypothesis dilatation neostomach essential factor weight regain GBP SG , benefit patient dual : 1/ validate prognostic value gastric volumetry gastric tomodensitometry gas order explain weight regain , order use standard . 2/ identification specific risk factor related surgical procedure could result surgical technique improvement well good adaptation revisional procedure , order improve treatment recurrent obesity .</brief_summary>
