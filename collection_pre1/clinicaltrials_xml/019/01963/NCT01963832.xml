	<criteria>Motor criterion determination make subject sitting . The moreaffected forearm rest support surface ( e.g. , arm chair ) allow maximum wrist flexion gravity . The minimum motor criterion ( MMC ) inclusion Grade 5 ( severe impairment ) ability : initiate extension gravity wrist least one digit , initiate extension flexion elbow , actively move shoulder ≥ 30° flexion , abduction , scaption The MMC inclusion Grade 4 ( moderately severe impairment ) ability actively : extend least two finger 0° less &lt; 10° , extend abduct thumb ≥ 10° extend wrist ≥ 10° fully flexed start position , extend elbow ≥ 20° 90° flexed start position , flex abduct shoulder &gt; 45° . Stroke patient extend least two finger ≥ 10° metacarpophalangeal ( MCP ) joint either proximal distal interphalangeal ( PIP DIP ) joint exclude . Additional inclusion criterion : must score ≤ 4 Modified Ashworth Scale ( 23 ) 116 moreaffected arm joint meet follow passive range movement criterion : ≥ 90° shoulder flexion , ≥ 90° shoulder abduction , ≥ 45° shoulder external rotation , ≤ 30° short normal elbow extension , forearm supination least neutral , forearm pronation 45° neutral , ≤ 35° short normal wrist extension , ≤ 35° short normal MCP extension digit . Less 1 year poststroke . Frailty insufficient stamen carry requirement therapy ( base clinical judgment ) . Ferrous metal body medical complication psychological problem would prohibit receive MRI . Positive pregnancy test woman childbearing age since 3T MRI contraindicate pregnant woman . Other neurological musculoskeletal condition affect UE function . Medication exclusionary except follow case : a. participation experimental drug study , b. Botox injection moreaffected UE &lt; 3 month prior enrollment , c. Baclofen Dantrium take orally time study , d. fluoxetine antidepressant SSRIlike property take &lt; 3 month prior enrollment , e. agent would contraindicate concurrent fluoxetine . If subject medication , medication record possible effect treatment outcome analyze separately . Moderate great depressive symptom indicate score &gt; 30/63 Beck Depression Inventory ( 24,25 ) .117 , 118 Concurrent participation formal physical rehabilitation program clinical trial . Excessive pain joint moreaffected arm could limit ability cooperate intervention ( base clinical judgment ) . Serious cognitive deficit manifest Folstein MiniMental State Examination ( MMSE ) score ≤ 24 ( 26 ) .119 Inadequate ability follow test instruction indicate Token Test Multilingual Aphasia Examination score ≤ 36 ( 27 ) .120 Serious , uncontrolled medical problem judge Medical Director ( e.g. , severe rheumatoid arthritis , serious joint deformity arthritic origin , symptomatic cancer renal disease , endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease , senility deteriorate condition due age , uncontrolled epilepsy ) . Motor problem primarily unilateral . Poor motivation participate study ( person marginally interested , he/she bad risk subject ) . Less 40 year old . Previous CIMT .</criteria>
