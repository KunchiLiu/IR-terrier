	<brief_summary>Currently , direct , reliable , bed-side , non-invasive method assess change brain activity associate concussion . Event Related Potentials ( ERPs ) , temporal reflection neural mass electrical activity cell specific region brain occur response stimulus , may offer method , provide noninvasive portable measure brain function . The ERPs provide excellent temporal information , spatial resolution ERPs traditionally limit . However , use high-density electroencephalograph ( EEG ) record spatial resolution ERPs improve significantly . The paradigm current study combine neurophysiological knowledge mathematical signal processing pattern recognition method ( BNA™ ) temporally spatially map brain function , connectivity synchronization . The propose study provide additional evidence utility contribution BNA™ test ( reflect temporal spatial change brain activity well brain functional connectivity associate concussion ) concussion management . The BNA test basically divide 3 phase - first EEG data collect subject use EEG system subject perform cognitive task front computer . The EEG data analyze use advanced BNA™ technology . Finally , report BNA™ test generate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Investigator Initiated Study Evaluate Effectiveness Brain Network Activation ( BNA™ ) Technology Management Sport Related Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single center study evaluate effectiveness BNA technology objective tool sport relate concussion management youth athlete ' population . The study include 150 athlete Minnesota Youth Hockey Programs . Subjects enrol study undergo screen baseline pre season visit follow visit/s . 1 . Follow-up test concuss athlete - Concussed athlete complete series post concussion follow visit . Each consist BNA™ test , ImPACT™ test , exam neurologist neurology nurse practitioner . The first visit within 72 hour injury re-evaluations occur weekly BNA normalize AND subject asymptomatic . Subject may return play point subject final additional BNA™ test one week athlete return full activity . If participant still symptomatic and/or BNA still abnormal 6 week reevaluation go every 2 week three month clear symptom AND normal BNA™ . If back baseline three month , monthly reevaluation study completion . 2 . Follow visit non-concussed athlete - non-concussed athlete complete follow visit upon completion sport season .</detailed_description>
