	<brief_title>Natural History Study Children With Metachromatic Leukodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) inherit , autosomal recessive disorder lipid metabolism characterize deficient activity lysosomal enzyme , arylsulfatase A ( ASA ) . MLD rare genetic disease occur part world . The estimate overall incidence disease western world approximately 1 100,000 live birth . This study multicenter , observational , longitudinal study plan enroll 30 patient onset MLD-related sign symptom prior 30 month age less 12 year age . Patients participate study approximately 114 week ( Screening Follow-up ) assess define interval disease status .</detailed_description>
