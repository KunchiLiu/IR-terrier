	<brief_title>ASG-15ME Study Escalating Doses AGS15E Given Monotherapy Subjects With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject receive single intravenous infusion AGS15E weekly 3 week every 4 week . A cycle 4 week . Subjects continue treatment disease progression , intolerability AGS15E , investigator decision , consent withdrawal . In subject discontinue therapy without documented disease progression still consent study procedure , every effort make continue monitoring disease status radiographic image progression document , new anticancer therapy , death . All subject continue follow survival withdrawal consent study closure . If assessed complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) per local review confirmatory scan perform less 4 week previous scan preferably week 5 . Tumor image also perform whenever disease progression suspect . Images send central third party image vendor independent assessment per RECIST version 1.1 . Although image study review central third party image vendor retrospective fashion , clinical decision base interpretation investigator site treat subject . Post-Treatment Follow-up Progression Free Survival : Subjects discontinue study reason objective disease progression continue disease assessment radiologically confirm progression , initiate new anticancer therapy , death , loss follow-up withdraw consent follow-up , whichever event occur first . The purpose post-treatment follow-up ascertain duration progression-free survival subject enrol study . Overall survival : All subject follow telephone contact every 2 month death , loss follow-up , withdrawal consent , whichever event occur first . A standard care clinic visit use lieu telephone call , subject already come clinic .</detailed_description>
