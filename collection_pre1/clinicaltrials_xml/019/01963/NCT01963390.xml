	<brief_summary>One promising understudied area field testosterone ( T ) therapy effect metabolism development type II diabetes . Metabolomics powerful research tool detect early sign metabolic derangement may lead metabolic disease . In observational study , investigator aim apply metabolomics order well understand T therapy influence metabolism . In clinical population outpatient men T deficiency investigator perform comprehensive clinical evaluation also obtain blood metabolomics . This do prior T therapy 4-6 month T therapy . Investigators hypothesize detect metabolic derangement men T deficiency derangement improve T therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One promising understudied area field T therapy effect insulin resistance ( IR ) development type II diabetes cardiometabolic disease . Although several clinical study suggest T therapy improve metabolic parameter may prevent disease progression , mechanism understanding process lacking . Investigators propose use metabolomics shed light metabolic function change T therapy . Metabolomics establish investigative tool measure hundreds unique chemical marker ( metabolite ) involve normal diseased cellular process blood sample . Previous study use Metabolite Profiling Platform Broad Institute Harvard/Massachusetts Institute Technology apply tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS ) -based metabolomics large , population-based cohort . These study identify validated highly sensitive signature IR successfully predict occult risk type II diabetes clinically normal men . Investigators plan apply metabolomics clinical population order obtain new perspective biochemical metabolic change occur base man 's testosterone status . Investigators plan study men symptomatic testosterone deficiency identify Men 's Health Boston ( MHB ) , outpatient men 's health clinic . In pilot study involve 32 blood sample , investigator already identify specific metabolomic signature men undergo androgen deprivation therapy prostate cancer . Based preliminary result recent study , investigator hypothesize detect metabolic derangement men T deficiency derangement respond change T level . Investigators address hypothesis though follow specific aim : Aim 1 : To characterize metabolite profile evaluate metabolic dysfunction T deficient men To accomplish aim investigator study T deficient men present MHB . In addition metabolite profiling , men undergo comprehensive clinical evaluation MHB include : - Complete History Physical exam - Assessment symptom T deficiency sexual function use validated questionnaire - Comprehensive hormonal metabolic laboratory evaluation - Body composition ( include visceral subcutaneous adiposity ) dual x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) Investigators build reference dataset relate metabolite profile metabolic risk factor clinical population T deficient men . This include data relationship metabolite profile sexual symptom T deficiency . Investigators also compare concentration select metabolite T deficient men match eugonadal control previously study Framingham cohort . Aim 2 : To determine T therapy influence metabolite profile IR 1 . To identify metabolite change response raise serum T 2 . To determine change metabolite profile relate change IR 3 . To determine response term sexual function symptom low T relate response metabolite profile IR . Metabolite profile obtain clinical evaluation perform ( described Aim1 ) baseline 6 month therapy . Investigators study interaction change sexual function serum T , IR , body composition metabolite profile ( particular attention establish metabolite marker IR ) .</detailed_description>
