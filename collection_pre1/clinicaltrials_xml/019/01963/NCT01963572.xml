	<brief_summary>Background Purposes : Cancer lead cause mortality . It threaten people 's life quality life ( QOL ) . Although incidence cancer still rise , promotion cancer screen progression medical technology , survival rate improving . However , sequel cancer treatment side effect impact patient along life . Breast cancer incident cancer woman high survival rate , continue care diagnosis treatment much need . This study use breast cancer example establish continue service model . This study aim ( 1 ) establish tailor , continue care model emphasize breast cancer patient ' function . ( 2 ) To investigate effectiveness new care model compare control . ( 3 ) To find cutting point bioelectrical impedance identify late development lymphedema . Methods : This randomized-controlled trial expand 3 year . Women newly diagnose breast cancer first OPD visit operation National Taiwan University Hospital invite join surveillance care system . Exclusion criterion : young 20 year old , stage IV , recurrent side involve , cancer diagnosis , functional impairment previous injury operation affect upper extremity physical mental problem influence test filling questionnaire . It estimate 100 subject participate study every year . After initial evaluation , randomly allocate surveillance group ( SG ) general care group ( CG ) . Totally , three-year study , 200 subject ( 100/group ) , follow-up 0.5 2 year . SG health education brochure free class first visit post-operatively CG brochure . Moreover , SG screen every time visit clinic . If early sign impairment , professional advice counsel give additionally . In visit , CG raise health-related question , answer . Detailed physical examination identify impairment QOL 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month operation group . Patients ' characteristic , functional status , QOL present descriptive statistic . T-test/Mann-Whitney U test use compare difference patient two group . Survival analysis log-rank test use show prevalence various functional impairment test difference . ROC curve use find cut point prediction lymphedema . Expected Results : It expect ( 1 ) set education program brochure breast cancer patient . ( 2 ) establish continue surveillance care model breast cancer patient extend cancer . ( 3 ) Women new care model le impairment high QOL compare woman post-operative stage . ( 4 ) To find prevalence functional impairment data control group . ( 5 ) A cut point bioelectrical impedance identify late development lymphedema find . ( 6 ) To train team member cancer care research .</brief_summary>
