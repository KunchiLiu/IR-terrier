	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) represent spectrum disease range simple steatosis nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , progressive form liver disease lead cirrhosis liver-related mortality person drink little alcohol . NAFLD define presence hepatic steatosis evidence hepatocellular injury form ballooning hepatocytes . NASH define presence hepatic steatosis inflammation hepatocyte injury ( balloon ) without fibrosis . NASH benign many affected individual cause progressive liver injury , indeed , may major cause cryptogenic cirrhosis1 . Currently , FDA approve treatment NAFLD . Weight loss exercise recommend often difficult maintain lifestyle change long term therefore therapeutic agent investigate . In study , propose treat 50 patient NAFLD diabetes either sitagliptin placebo 24 week . After initial evaluation insulin sensitivity MRI liver fat distribution , patient receive either 100 mg/day sitagliptin placebo . Patients monitor regular interval symptoms liver disease , side effect sitagliptin serum biochemical metabolic index . At end 24-weeks , patient repeat medical evaluation , liver MRI optional liver biopsy . Pre post treatment MRI-derived liver fat content insulin sensitivity compare . The primary end point successful therapy improvement hepatic steatosis measure MRI . Secondary end point improvement insulin sensitivity liver biochemistry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sitagliptin Versus Placebo Treatment Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : 1 . To examine efficacy sitagliptin 100 mg orally daily versus placebo improve hepatic steatosis assess magnetic resonance imaging patient NAFLD . Secondary objective : 1 . To examine efficacy sitagliptin improve serum AST patient NAFLD . 2 . To examine efficacy sitagliptin improve serum ALT patient NAFLD . 3 . To examine efficacy sitagliptin improve serum LDL patient NAFLD . 4 . To examine efficacy sitagliptin improvement insulin sensitivity patient NAFLD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>44 patient NAFLD randomize either sitagliptin placebo 24weeks . Enrollment 50 patient need allow exclusion patient initial evaluation dropout small number patient intolerance sitagliptin . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Age entry least 18 year . 2 . Serum alanine ( ALT ) aspartate ( AST ) aminotransferase activity upper limit normal . 19 woman 30 men . 3 . Evidence hepatic steatosis liver fat ( ≥5 % ) MRI . 4 . Prediabetic patient control diabetic patient define ADA position statement diabetes mellitus . Prediabetics HbA1c 5.7 6.4 control diabetic patient HbA1c 6.4 8.0 . 5 . Written informed consent . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Uncontrolled diabetes define Hb A1c ≥ 8.0 . 2 . Evidence another form liver disease . Hepatitis B define presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . Hepatitis C define presence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) RNA serum . Autoimmune hepatitis define antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) 1:160 great liver histology consistent autoimmune hepatitis previous response immunosuppressive therapy . Autoimmune cholestatic liver disorder define elevation alkaline phosphatase antimitochondrial antibody great 1:80 liver histology consistent primary biliary cirrhosis elevation alkaline phosphatase liver histology consistent sclerosing cholangitis . Wilson disease define ceruloplasmin limit normal liver histology consistent Wilson disease . Alpha1antitrypsin deficiency define alpha1antitrypsin level less normal liver histology consistent alpha1antitrypsin deficiency . Hemochromatosis define presence 3+ 4+ stainable iron liver biopsy homozygosity C282Y compound heterozygosity C282Y/H63D . Druginduced liver disease define basis typical exposure history . Bile duct obstruction show imaging study . 3 . History excess alcohol ingestion , average 30 gm/day ( 3 drink per day ) previous 10 year , history alcohol intake average great 10 gm/day ( 1 drink per day : 7 drink per week ) previous one year . 4 . Advanced liver disease : platelet count &lt; 75,000/mm3 prothrombin time &gt; 16 second history bleed disorder 5 . Decompensated liver disease , ChildPugh score great equal 7 point 6 . History gastrointestinal bypass surgery ingestion drug know produce hepatic steatosis include corticosteroid , highdose estrogen , methotrexate , tetracycline amiodarone previous 6 month . 7 . Recent initiation change antidiabetic drug , include insulin , sulfonylurea , thiazolidinediones previous 90 day . 8 . Use sitagliptin agent class within 90 day prior randomization . 9 . Significant systemic major illness liver disease , include congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease , pulmonary disease hypoxia , renal failure , organ transplantation , serious psychiatric disease , malignancy , opinion investigator would preclude treatment Sitagliptin adequate follow . 10 . History acute pancreatitis within last 5 year exception gallstone pancreatitis . 11 . Positive test antiHIV . 12 . Active substance abuse , alcohol , inhale injection drug within previous one year . 13 . Pregnancy inability practice adequate contraception woman childbearing potential . 14 . Evidence hepatocellular carcinoma : alphafetoprotein level great 200 ng/ml and/or liver mass image study suggestive liver cancer . 15 . Any condition , , opinion investigator would impede competence compliance possibility hinder completion study . 16 . Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl . 17 . Contraindications Sitagliptin use : History allergic reaction Sitagliptin Patients acute liver injury unexplained persistent elevation ALT &gt; 500 U/L baseline . Women pregnant may become pregnant Nursing mother 18 . Contraindications MRI : The subject contraindication MR imaging , patient pacemaker , metallic cardiac valve , magnetic material surgical clip , implant electronic infusion pump condition would preclude proximity strong magnetic field . The subject history extreme claustrophobia The subject fit inside MR scanner cavity 11 . RECRUITMENT Enrollment patient may initiate IRB approval acquire continue June 2015 . Patients recruit follow population : Primary care internal medicine clinic Tertiary referral clinic Hillcrest Campus Perlman Clinics : GI/Liver clinic Liver transplant clinic Obesity clinic Bariatric surgery clinic Diabetes clinic Lipid disorder clinic Physicians take care patient would provide information regard study either refer patient clinic ask patient directly contact PI research assistant . Patient would give information regard possible study NAFLD liver clinic provider . We would ask patient call email PI research assistant discus study , interested .</criteria>
