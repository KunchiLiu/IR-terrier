	<brief_summary>15 % diabetic diabetic foot ( DF ) live associate risk amputation mortality two time great diabetic population without DF . Predicting occurrence DF limit occurrence diabetic wound involve assessment treatment . Our team behind discovery Pressure-Induced Vasodilation ( PIV ) first observe healthy subject local application gradual pressure skin lead cutaneous vasodilation application pressure . This gain blood flow delay onset ischemia . However involvement PIV DF , also pressure-induced skin lesion , remain demonstrated diabetic subject . The main objective study show PIV , functional examination cutaneous microcirculation develop , alter presence DF , take account influence age neuropathy .</brief_summary>
