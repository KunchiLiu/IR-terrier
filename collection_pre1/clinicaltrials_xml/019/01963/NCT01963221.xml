	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine relationship thoracic aortic inflammation arterial stiffness elderly patient . Vascular-aging accompany gradual remodel affect cardiac arterial wall . Arterial hypertension , establish cardiovascular risk factor , suggest exert pro-inflammatory action throw several biological mediator enhance arterial stiffness . Both effect age hypertension associate high level arterial stiffness , respective role well establish pathophysiology arterial stiffening . Few data available neither real anatomic aortic impact age hypertension aortic compliance ventricular function relationship arterial stiffness assess carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity , reliability cine phase contrast magnetic resonance image arterial stiffness measurement . Recent study use positron emission tomography imaging ( PET ) 18 F fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) advocate mean measure arterial wall inflammation various population refer oncology stag . FDG uptake correlate number cardiovascular risk factor even risk future cardiovascular event . This method , combine X-ray compute tomography ( CT ) , also demonstrate aortic calcification quantify CT local sign inflammation detect FDG uptake contribute arterial stiffness . A strong relationship large vessel stiffen assess carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity measurement , aortic calcification quantify CT inflammation evaluate FDG uptake demonstrate . Therefore , current study , use FDG PET associate CT characterize aortic inflammation aortic calcification couple pulse wave velocity measurement cardiac function elderly individual . In fact , vascular age promote local inflammatory process risk factor cardiovascular disease , vascular change assess non-invasive vascular imaging ( MRI , FDG PET ) could represent potential target treatment prevention Thirty individual â‰¥ 65 year age examine , 15 hypertensive subject 15 control . Pulse wave velocity , surrogate aortic stiffness , measure cine phase contrast magnetic resonance image applanation tonometry . Brachial pulse pressure , carotid calculate pulse pressure pulse pressure amplification ( brachial carotid ratio ) , predictor cardiovascular mortality also quantify . Thoracic aorta local inflammation calcification measure 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging . Moreover , biomarkers low grade inflammation ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , interleukin 6 also determine ) .</brief_summary>
