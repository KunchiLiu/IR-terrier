	<brief_summary>Introduction In recent year , client-centred task-oriented training emerge important method rehabilitation include rehabilitation person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The task-oriented intervention focus resolve , reduce prevent impairment , develop effective task-specific strategy adapt functional goal-oriented strategy change environmental condition . Currently , task-specific training mainly achieve constant practice ( i.e . repeat task without variation ) report improve performance train task , negative impact untrained task . Practice variability , however , report advantageous transfer training result daily live . This paradox pose challenge clinical practice , task-specific training essential deliver client-centred training order focus patient ' specific individual goal , practice variability important able transfer learn task daily practice . Questions regard effective element within rehabilitative intervention exact mechanism behind cerebral change may induce , remain . These question require research , ultra-high field fMRI technique use . Furthermore , compensation muscle function loss ( i.e . development new muscle synergy ) play important role improvement skill performance cervical SCI . Surface EMG allow study change muscle coordination , parallel change cerebral level . Aims This study aim 1. investigate basic neural mechanism motor learn underlie functional recovery arm hand skilled performance client-centred task-oriented training upper limb patient cervical spinal cord injury 2. investigate contribution 'practice variability ' contrast 'constant practice ' arm-hand skilled performance , motor control neural change . Study design This study feature multiple single-case experimental design ( A-B-C design ) baseline ( phase A ) ( 6 week ) , intervention B ( phase B ) ( 3 week ) intervention C ( phase C ) ( 3 week ) . Intervention B contain 'practice variability ' component . Intervention C feature 'constant practice ' component . The order phase B C randomly assign participant . Four measurement baseline intervention phase ( B C ) perform , thus produce time series , per measure , patient . Also , meta-analyses pool single-case data perform . Setting/population Six patient cervical SCI ( complete incomplete ) recruit Spinal cord unit Adelante Rehabilitation Centre ( sub ) acute phase . Intervention After therapy usual ( intervention A ) , Task-oriented Client-centred Upper Extremity Skill Training ( ToCUEST ) module ( Spooren et al. , 2011 ) provide . In program individual goal extract use Canadian Occupational Performance Measure ( COPM ) train program base task-analysis us principle train physiology motor learning . Intervention B consist ToCUEST program , include component 'practice variability ' ( ToCUEST variability ) . Intervention C consist modified ToCUEST program component 'practice variability ' replace 'constant practice ' ( ToCUEST constant ) order evaluate contribution component . Intervention A ' therapy usual . Measurements Measurements take level activity ( arm hand skilled performance , i.e . Van Lieshout Test , Spinal Cord Independence Measure , Goal Attainment Scale ) body function ( Upper Extremity Motor Score , Graded Redefined Assessment Strength Sensibility Prehension Test , Surface EMG ) , cerebral level , i.e . neural activity change ( mean ultra-high field fMRI ) . The fMRI measurement take intervention B C 4 patient ( 2 complete 2 incomplete lesion ) . Data-analyses Baseline data stability baseline trend regard outcome measure body function level activity level assess . To control , e.g. , spontaneous recovery effect , baseline data ( phase A ) use computer-based detrending model . For meta-analyses , mean data per outcome measure , per phase , per subject pool subsequently analyse use non-parametric statistic , i.e . Friedman analyse Wilcoxon test .</brief_summary>
