	<brief_summary>Regular physical activity one prominent health-protective behaviour might increase help self-regulatory strategy action planning . The aim randomise control trial examine change daily moderate physical activity couple follow ( ) dyadic plan intervention , ( b ) individual planning intervention ( c ) no-planning control condition . Changes daily physical activity examine period one year . It assume target person couple receive dyadic plan intervention show great increase daily physical activity target person couple receive individual planning intervention . For couple receive dyadic plan intervention individual planning intervention , hypothesize target person show high increase daily physical activity target person couple participate no-planning control condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Days Motion : A Planning Intervention Study With Couples Enhance Daily Physical Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular physical activity reduces risk number grave chronic disease , include many form cancer . Guidelines indicate increase moderate physical activity 30 60 minute least 5 day week already associate significant health benefit . However , recent epidemiologic information indicate 20 % German adult population fully meet important health behaviour goal . Despite relatively moderate recommend increase physical activity apparently high acceptance goal increase moderate daily physical activity , many people fall short goal achievement , implementation maintenance behaviour change often fail . Therefore , aside enhance motivational factor , intervention promote health-behaviour change ( e.g. , increase physical activity ) , commonly extend address volitional strategy , action planning . Action plan aid individual translate goal behaviour . By form action plan , individual link situational cue ( 'when ' 'where ' specification critical situation ) behavioural response ( 'what ' 'how act ' ) 'if-then'-format . Available finding suggest action planning aside direct effect behaviour change , include increase physical activity , also foster self-regulation strategy effective implementation maintenance change health-related behaviour . Research action plan far mainly focus benefit individual 's self-regulation behaviour . To date little evidence role close social environment plan health-behaviour change . However , marry cohabit individual often try succeed coregulating partner ' health behaviour , include partner ' level physical activity . Therefore , propose study , extension individual action plan level dyad , i.e. , dyadic planning , examine , along associate mechanism fit aid process increase physical activity . Dyadic plan refers create together partner if-then plan , individual target person implement new behaviour ( e.g. , physically active ) . We hypothesise dyadic planning lead high increase daily physical activity compare individual planning planning . In propose randomise controlled trial , compare change daily moderate physical activity N = 346 adult ( primary outcome ) partner receive general motivational treatment enhance daily physical activity randomly assign one three intervention condition : ( ) dyadic plan intervention , target person form action plan increase daily physical activity together partner , ( b ) individual planning intervention , target person form action plan individually partner receive distraction task , ( c ) no-planning control condition , target person receive instruction action planning , perform distraction task together partner . The study entail experimental longitudinal design baseline assessment ( T0 ) , intervention session one week follow baseline ( T1 ) follow-up assessment 1 week ( T2 ) , 6 ( T3 ; primary endpoint ) , 19 ( T4 ) , 26 ( T6 ) , 52 ( T7 ) week follow main intervention session . A booster intervention ( T5 ) take place 20 week main intervention session , i.e . 1 week follow T4 . Objective measurement daily physical activity include 4 one-week ( T0 , T2 , T3 , T7 ) accelerometer assessment . Additionally , objective measurement cardiorespiratory fitness , BMI , waist-to-hip ratio along self-report assessment target person partner collect . Proposed mechanism total intervention effect along covariates assess mostly via self-report . Results study contribute still limit understanding interplay individual dyadic regulation increase daily physical activity maintenance , person target intervention partner . Findings guide development economical dyadic plan intervention straightforwardly implement clinical setting support initiation maintenance preventive behaviour couple . Furthermore , theoretically-derived dyadic plan intervention easily extend domain health-behaviour change .</detailed_description>
