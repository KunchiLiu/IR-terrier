	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : We extend pilot study ( IRB STU27549 ) objective measurement skin pigmentation correlation self-reported skin reaction sun exposure large sample special emphasis people skin color compare result obtain spectrophotometry . We find forty-two percent ( 114 270 ) participant ' response burn tan question could classify use standard Fitzpatrick skin phototype ( FST ) definition . At present , seek determine accuracy adapt Skin Sun Sensitivity Scale individual pigmentation variety ( FST I VI ) compare spectrophotometric measurement assess FST . Fitzpatrick Skin Phototyping Skin phototyping usually determine subjectively trained investigator clinician use sun burn and/or sun tan response . In addition , subject self-report ease sunburn tan use survey determine risk develop skin cancer . ( Table 1 ) Responses Fitzpatrick Skin Phototype ( SPT ) question may unreliable due recall bias , subjective bias clinician subject , lack cultural sensitivity question , subject ' use sun protection behavior early childhood subject may experience sunburn . Table 1 . Skin type ; Erythema Tanning Reactions First Summer Exposure I Always burn , never tan ( painful burn 24 hrs tan 7d ) II Burn easy , develop light tan ( painful burn 24 hr light tan 7d ) III Burn moderately , develop light tan ( slightly tender burn 24 hr , moderate tan 7d ) IV Burn minimally-rarely , develop moderate tan ( burn 24 hr good tan 7d ) V Never burn , always develop dark tan VI Never burn , noticeable change appearance Unreliable Sunburning History A limitation 6 integer Roman numeral Fitzpatrick SPT reliance upon history sunburn first exposure summer . For reside region sun exposure year ( e.g . Arizona , Florida , California ) , sunburning-tanning question first exposure summer often irrelevant . Lastly , 1990s people begin use sunscreens prevent sunburn , thus , sun sensitive skin may never experience sunburn unable answer question ease sun burning . Multi-ethnic Populations There tendency group people similar ethnic group single category SPT , introduce potential bias subjective assessment SPT investigator . For example , Hispanic white often consider `` brown '' assign Skin Type IV ( Table 2 ) . The heterogeneity multi-ethnic background make difficult assess susceptibility skin cancer basis skin color , predominantly determine pigment hemoglobin , melanin , bilirubin , carotene . Skin Phototyping Sunburning Ability . Skin Phototype Appearance Sunburning ability I Very white freckle Always burn II White Usually burn III White Olive Sometimes burn IV Brown Rarely burn V Dark brown Very rarely burn VI Black Never burn Over last 3 decade , Fitzpatrick SPT evolve original purpose determine amount ultraviolet light ( UVL ) treatment psoriasis patient live New England become assessment tool skin cancer risk . As part evolution , original 4 skin type ( I-IV ) , assess sun reactivity standardize question ease sun burn tan reaction first summer sun exposure , modify add SPT V VI include brown black skin . Our research demonstrate SPT modification include people skin color neither culturally sensitive accurate people color unable respond question experience sunburn tanning . People skin color report become red pink rather experience `` irritation '' sun exposure . In recently report work , propose modification FST question allow people skin color able respond ( Survey question 1and 2 ) . We wish test response people self-report question compare response melanin index determine spectrophotometry . ( Survey question 9 ) Spectrophotometry The `` gold standard '' method assess skin pigmentation reflectance spectrophotometry ( RS ) . Pershing et al perform seminal research compare area curve obtain RS profile constitutive skin color clinician ' assessment SPT . For skin type I-III , Pershing et al ( 2008 ) find inconsistency clinician ' reflectance spectrophotometric ( RS ) assessments SPT . The clinician adjust patient ' SPT determine historical sun burn tan response factor observed hair eye color . For example , red-haired individual determine RS SPT III list SPT I clinical dermatologist . Subjective assessment SPT clinicians heavily influenced patient ' hair eye color . The Pershing study , accrue 125 subject accrue sufficient number subject skin color ( Skin type III-VI ) able report meaningful result . ( I 20 ; II 53 , III 21 , IV 10 , V 16 , VI 5 ) It note area curve obtain RS include red reflectance , thus , solely represent skin pigmentation . Skin pigmentation melanin provide photoprotection calculate melanin index , MI . ( see follow section Melanin Index ) Even early 1961 , potential confounding MI obtain RS dilatation superficial blood vessel recognize . The device , Mexameter MX 18 , internally correct red reflectance calculate melanin index . The melanin index derive multilayered skin model Lambert-Beer 's law . Significance : While risk develop skin cancer less melanin content ( skin type I ) low risk ( skin type VI ) , people skin phototypes mid-range ( III IV ) believe natural skin tone protective sunburn , thus , fail use sun protection . When people skin type III IV expose intense ultraviolet light southern latitude Chicago surprise sunburn experience . In proof principle research , people skin type III IV , view image skin computer screen , perceive `` color grainy '' make conclusion `` hole '' skin pigment make possible burn This study objectively measure MI people skin color . Thus , essential accrue representative sample people skin color ethnic group represent great range skin type self-identifying member group . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES : Our principal objective correlate melanin index usual condition spectrophotometry adapt Fitzpatrick SPT determine patient ' response adapt questionnaire .</detailed_description>
