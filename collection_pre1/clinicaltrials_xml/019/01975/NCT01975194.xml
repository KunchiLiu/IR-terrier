	<detailed_description>Background : Blacks twice risk stroke compare Whites recent analysis find stroke incidence decrease Whites Blacks . Identifying new avenue stroke prevention important African Americans . The Stroke Prevention Aggressive Reduction Cholesterol Levels ( SPARCL ) trial show treatment atorvastatin 80 mg/d reduce frequency stroke 16 % . In SPARCL trial , mean low density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C treatment group 73 mg/dl . On basis SPARCL trial , American Stroke Association recommend statins `` intensive lipid lowering effect '' secondary prevention 2008 guideline update . Achieving target level important secondary prevention stroke , patient annual risk stroke recurrence 3-15 % per year . Rosuvastatin well suit secondary prevention goal due potent lipid-lowering effect . Objectives The objective study establish following : 1 . That dose escalation regimen rosuvastatin 20-40 mg achieve 70 % success reach LDL-C target &lt; 100 mg/dl 2 . That dose escalation regimen rosuvastatin 20-40 mg achieve 50 % success reach LDL-C target &lt; 70 mg/dl individual high risk Design 60 patient identify inpatient outpatient setting two medical center . African American patient diagnosis ischemic stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within previous 12 month identify . Both patient already statins statin naïve patient recruit . For patient statin , washout period require due ethical reason . After provide informed consent , baseline lipid value obtain . Study subject initiate start dose rosuvastatin 20 mg . Subjects follow every six week 3 month period . A lipid profile LFT 's obtained 6 week 3 month . Patients intensive LDL-C target &lt; 70 mg/dl increase 40 mg , necessary . The final 3 month lipid profile use determine achievement target . Treatments Rosuvastatin 20 mg start dose . As described , patient may titrate 40 mg 6 week LDL cholesterol &gt; 70 mg/dl . Safety monitor Adverse Event An Adverse Event ( AE ) development undesirable medical condition deterioration pre-existing medical condition follow exposure pharmaceutical product , whether consider causally related product . An undesirable medical condition symptom ( eg , nausea , chest pain ) , sign ( eg , tachycardia , enlarge liver ) abnormal result investigation ( eg , laboratory finding , ECG ) . In clinical study , AE include undesirable medical condition occur time , include run-in washout period , even study treatment administer . Any detrimental change patient 's condition subsequent enter study follow-up period consider AE . When deterioration condition study treatment use , may uncertainty whether lack efficacy AE . In case , unless report physician considers study treatment contribute deterioration local regulation state contrary , deterioration consider lack efficacy . Signs symptoms disease progression therefore consider AEs .</detailed_description>
