	<criteria>Subject willing able give inform consent participation study . Male female subject age 18 year . Subject diagnose Stage III Stage IV HNSCC . Subject due undergo radiotherapy head and/or neck without concomitant chemotherapy likelihood ( investigator 's opinion ) develop mild , moderate severe oral mucositis . Subject able ( investigator 's opinion ) willing comply study requirement . Subject willing able communicate investigator . Subject acceptable haematological biochemical function , opinion investigator , demonstrate appropriate laboratory parameter level include liver renal function ( estimate glomerular filtration rate measure CockcroftGault formula &gt; 0.5 low limit normal , aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase &lt; 2.5 upper limit normal ( ULN ) bilirubin &lt; 1.5 ULN ) , opinion investigator , acceptable bone marrow reserve . Vital sign screen ( five minute rest measure supine position ) must within follow range : . Body temperature 35.037.5°C ii . Systolic blood pressure , 90150 mmHg iii . Diastolic blood pressure , 6090 mmHg iv . Pulse rate , 4099 beat per minute Blood pressure pulse rate take stand position . After two minute stand , shall 20 mmHg drop systolic 10 mmHg drop diastolic blood pressure , associate clinical manifestation postural hypotension . Subject Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 , 1 2 . Subject willing name notify responsible authority participation study , applicable individual country . Subject willing allow primary care practitioner consultant notify participation study . Subjects undergoing chemotherapy . Subjects cancer HNSCC primary tumour . Subjects undergone reconstructive oral surgery HNSCC ( within last eight week ) . Subjects RTOG Grade 4 oral mucositis ( necrosis deep ulceration , without bleed ) . Subjects require hospital admission extend hospitalisation total parenteral nutrition , intravenous analgesia and/or intravenous antibiotic treatment oral mucositis . Subjects aphthous stomatitis , herpetic mucositis , oral thrush , denture/oral trauma , gangrenous stomatitis , acute necrotising stomatitis oral condition may opinion investigator affect oromucosal absorption Sativex® absence oral mucositis . Any surgical medical condition , significant disease disorder find physical examination ( oral examination ) ( underlie condition ) might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug , opinion investigator , may put subject risk , influence result study , subject ' ability participate study . Clinical evidence acute chronic liver disease liver injury indicate clinically significant abnormal liver function test aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , gamma glutamyltranspeptidase , alkaline phosphatase , ( ≥2.5 ULN ) serum bilirubin ( ≥1.5 ULN ) unless another likely explanation ( e.g . Gilbert 's syndrome ) . Any change medication within 14 day prior dose throughout study might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) , opinion investigator . History drug abuse within 12 month prior dose evidence abuse indicate laboratory assay conduct screen baseline evaluation . Any known suspected hypersensitivity cannabinoids excipients IMP ( ) . Positive result presence hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C virus antibody , human immunodeficiency virus antibody . Currently use use cannabis , cannabinoidbased medication ( e.g . Marinol® , Nabilone® , Cannador® ) Acomplia® ( rimonabant ) taranabant within 30 day study entry unwilling abstain duration study . Any known suspected history family history schizophrenia , psychotic illness , history severe personality disorder severe significant psychiatric disorder depression associate underlying condition . Any history epilepsy evidence one seizure last 12 month . Significant cardiac disease , cardiac disorder opinion investigator would put subject risk clinically relevant arrhythmia myocardial infarction , secondary tertiary atrioventricular block , evidence clinically significant cardiac disease electrocardiogram screening .

Female subject pregnant , lactate plan pregnancy course study three month thereafter . Subjects receive IMP within 12 week prior screen visit . Any significant disease disorder , opinion investigator , may either put subject risk participation study , may influence result study , subject 's ability participate study . Following physical examination , subject abnormality , opinion investigator would prevent subject safe participation study . Unwilling abstain donation blood study .
