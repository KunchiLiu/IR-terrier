	<brief_summary>Rationale : Local radiotherapy apply treatment tumor change metabolic profile expose area and/or systemically specific radiation biomarkers identify respective matrix . Purpose : This pilot study verify human result obtain two animal model expose ionize gamma-radiation . The classification patient result treatment volume radiotherapy cancer disease . Two patient group different type cancer ( breast cancer endometrial cancer ) undergo high-dose radiotherapy select compare control group age match healthy woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Humans expose ionize radiation several source . Gamma-radiation exposure induce thereby short- long-term adverse effect . The radiation injury expect human acute stage ( day week radiation exposure ) correlate radiation dose individual receive . With high dos gastrointestinal syndrome lead death within day . The survival individual acute stage therefore dramatically dependent rapid application suitable therapy . It decisive identify short possible time person expose critical radiation dose estimate dose receive order apply adequate therapy . There satisfy test method available today , would enable mass screen radiation injury . Furthermore identify change local systemic human metabolic fingerprint , useful prediction individual sensitivity patient radiotherapy / lead well understanding molecular mechanism involve radiotherapy . Objective Primary : The primary endpoint affirm result animal model radiation metabolomics human radiotherapy treatment . Secondary : The secondary endpoint find new potential biomarkers radiation biodosimetry human identify change different sequence measure local ( sebum ) systemic ( blood , saliva urine ) material . Methods Gas chromatographic separation mass spectrometric detection metabolites present give matrix ( urine , saliva , plasma , sebum ) .</detailed_description>
