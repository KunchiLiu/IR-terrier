Children assign EMT group receive 24 , 1-hour session direct intervention home include teach parent implement EMT procedure across activity . Children assess 4 time point ( intervention , 6 month 12 month post-intervention ) allow description comparison individual language growth trajectory period 18 month . In addition , examine relation language growth emergent problem behavior social skill development determine whether early language intervention prevent difficulty frequently associate early language delay . Results study determine efficacy parent-plus-therapist implement EMT new population child , provide evidence potential preventing persistent language delay secondary social effect early language delay , expand developmental theory link persistent language delay specific risk factor behavioral outcome .
