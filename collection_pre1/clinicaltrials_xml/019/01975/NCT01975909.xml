	<brief_summary>Spinocerebellar Ataxia ( SCA ) refers family genetic disease cause progressive problem gait balance , well debilitate symptom . This randomize control pilot study test novel therapeutic intervention use noninvasive magnetic brain stimulation improve functional outcome patient SCA . The study include quantitative evaluation gait , balance , brain physiology examine possible objective end-points future , large multi-site clinical trial . The investigator anticipate patient receive real intervention show functional gain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spinocerebellar Ataxia ( SCA ) refers family genetic disease cause progressive problem gait balance , well debilitate symptom . There cure SCA lack effective symptomatic treatment . Investigators recruit 20 patient genetically-confirmed SCA use novel approach - noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) - improve balance , gait , posture patient SCA . Half randomly assign real intervention , half sham ( control ) intervention . The TMS intervention consist 20 stimulation session four week period . At baseline follow-up , patient undergo comprehensive assessment include several SCA rating scale , along sophisticated test balance ( ie . walking , stand , muscle coordination ) . Patients also complete series neurophysiologic test evaluate function cerebellum connection intervention . Investigators anticipate patient receive real TMS show good balance , few fall , improve mobility , undergo sham stimulation show benefit . If prediction correct , study provide evidence-based support new treatment improve live patient SCA .</detailed_description>

Ataxia derive cause geneticallyconfirmed SCA ( include limit alcoholism , head injury , Multiple Sclerosis , olivopontocerebellar atrophy multiple system atrophy ) . No medication absolute exclusion TMS . Medications review responsible MD decision inclusion make base following : 1 . The patient 's past medical history , drug dose , history recent medication change duration treatment , combination CNS active drug . 2 . The published TMS guideline review medication consider TMS . History seizure , diagnosis epilepsy , history abnormal ( epileptiform ) EEG . TMS MRISpecific exclusion criterion include : 1 . Known metal head ( surgical aneurysm clip ) history prior neurosurgical procedure . 2 . Ferromagnetic bioimplants activate electronic , mechanical magnetic mean , cochlear implant , pacemaker , medication pump , vagal stimulators , deep brain stimulators , neurostimulators , biostimulators , ventriculoperitoneal shunt . 3 . Subjects might bullet fragment shrapnel ( veterans worker expose metal work environment ) . 4 . Subjects metallic paint ( e.g . color contact lenses , tattoo , metallic eyeliner ) 5 .
