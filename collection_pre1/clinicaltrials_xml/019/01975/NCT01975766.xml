	<brief_title>Ketogenic Diet Phase 1 Head &amp; Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard treatment head &amp; neck cancer often include chemotherapy concurrent radiation therapy ( chemoradiation ) . This study phase I trial determine safety dietary manipulation chemoradiation head &amp; neck cancer . Specifically , pre-clinical data mouse study indicate ketogenic diet increase tumor cell kill . Participants : - Utilize specialized ketogenic diet design bionutritional service clinical research unit . This diet begin 2 day chemoradiation continue least 5 week chemoradiation . - Have blood draw research purpose weekly determine measurement oxidative stress - Have urine collect sporadically study determine measurement oxidative stress - Keep diary concomitant medication , side effect , blood sugar - Have follow-up monitor outcomes overall survival</detailed_description>
