	<detailed_description>This study enroll HIV-1-infected child less 12 year age naive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) ( never take ARV drug ) . Study participant assign 1 2 cohort base age . Cohort 1 include child least 6 year age less 12 year age . Cohort 2 include child least 2 year age less 6 year age . Each cohort consist two stage : Stage 1 Stage 2 . Stage 1 initial dose find stage . Participants begin treatment daily RPV 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) . The 2 NRTIs select site investigator provide study . This stage study involve intense pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample evaluate safety , tolerability , antiviral activity RPV , allow selection RPV dose use Stage 2 study . Participants cohort remain RPV-based therapy 48 week . Study enrollment begin Cohort 1 . Once data Cohort 1 review RPV dose approve , enrollment Cohort 2 begin . Study participation include least 12 study visit 48 week . Participants complete 48 week RPV treatment benefit drug continue study receive RPV part long-term safety follow-up minimum 4 additional year . Study visit stage study occur every 24 week . At visit , participant give medical history undergo physical exam , blood collection , urine collection . At visit , participant also undergo electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) stimulation test ( consist blood collection injection ACTH ) , determination participant 's stage sexual development .</detailed_description>
