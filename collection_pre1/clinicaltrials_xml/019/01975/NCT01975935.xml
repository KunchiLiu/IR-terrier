	<brief_summary>This study involve research investigational medicine call Amlexanox . The reason study find Amlexanox improve type 2 diabetes , insulin resistance , obesity non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . In study , Amlexanox consider investigational ( approve Food Drug Administration [ FDA ] ) type 2 diabetes , insulin resistance , obesity non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . This placebo control study . There 50-50 chance patient may either receive study drug , Amlexanox , placebo ( sugar pill ) . Neither patient study doctor know patient receive study drug placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal focus clinical proof concept study evaluate novel hypothesis . We propose overnutrition , lead obesity , represent state excessive energy storage promote insulin . The stress excessive energy storage initiate set homeostatic response include generation adipose tissue liver inflammation , involve secretion proinflammatory cytokine block energy storage fat liver induce insulin resistance , thus relieve stress adipocyte hepatocyte . However , recent data suggest inflammation counter secondary feedback loop , term `` counter-inflammation '' . We propose process keep inflammation check , ensure maintain low level . At time counter-inflammation also promote energy conservation via increase energy storage decrease utilization manner insulin-independent . We hypothesize noncanonical IkB kinases Ikke TBK1 `` counterinflammatory '' kinases feedback inhibit inflammatory pathway help support positive energy balance . How hypothesis address human subject ? A number clinical trial already initiate intention improve insulin resistance attenuate inflammation . Many focus blockade single cytokine receptor TNFa , IL1 MCP1 ( CCR2 antagonist ) . While record trial mixed , complexity inflammatory pathway elicit obesity suggest inhibition single cytokine likely sufficient . Additionally , numerous study implicate NFkB pathway obesity-induced inflammation , NFkB inhibitor contemplate . Salsalate originally resuscitate due perceive activity block NFkB hence block inflammation . However , although clinical study drug promising , precisely salsalate work , target , whether actually function NFkB inhibitor remain controversial ( recent data indicate may act via activation AMPK ) . We describe new potential therapeutic agent result academic collaborative drug discovery effort carry University Michigan . Our study elucidate role NFkB insulin resistance macrophage activation lead identification Ikke TBK1 potential target therapeutic intervention obesity type 2 diabetes . We perform high throughput screen search inhibitor kinase , evaluate group 175,000 compound included collection approve drug . Interestingly , potent specific inhibitor discover amlexanox ; old drug originally develop Japan treatment asthma allergic rhinitis , later US aphthous ulcer , without well understood mechanism action . It use since 1987 , favorable side effect profile . This protocol first proof concept study evaluate possible repurposing Amlexanox treatment type 2 diabetes obesity . At time , hope test hypothesis IKKe TBK1 may important player maintain positive energy balance , also support insulin resistance , prolong over-nutrition . Finally , study also provide valuable insight validity two protein kinase drug target future development new chemical entity useful treatment type 2 diabetes . Therefore specific aim 1 . Does amlexanox treatment improve measure type 2 diabetes , insulin resistance obesity ? To address question , intend treat patient clinical Type 2 diabetes Grade 1/2 obesity ( BMI 27 45 kg/m2 ) period 3 month double-blinded placebo control proof-of concept study . We enroll 40 patient without evidence severe end-organ damage chronic complication Type 2 diabetes also metformin and/or DPPIV inhibitor medication , also clear-cut evidence hyperglycemia ( HbA1c &gt; 6.5 % &lt; 10.0 % ) . These patient treat either placebo Amlexanox oral tablet start dose 25 mg PO tid 2 week titrate dose 50 mg PO tid ( dos use treat asthma human lead serum concentration comparable metabolically effective dos rodent study ) remainder therapy period . HbA1c target primary end-point study . Fasting lipid profile , plasma insulin , HOMA-IR , clinical marker inflammation adipocytokine profile measure parameter interest baseline , 6 week 12 week . Insulin secretion well insulin sensitivity probe use mixed meal test . Weight also important secondary end-point study . We determine rest energy expenditure indirect calorimetry total body composition use DEXA baseline 12 week . Safety monitoring CBC , comprehensive metabolic biochemistry , CPK urine analyse undertaken 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 week , urinary albumin baseline 12 week . Measures safety efficacy repeat 4 week drug discontinue well . 2 . Does amlexanox treatment improve measure NAFLD obese patient ? All participant clinical proof-of-concept study outline aim study degree steatosis liver use MRI MR spectroscopy baseline 3 month study . 3 . Development biomarkers treatment patient type 2 diabetes amlexanox . We evaluate phosphorylation protein know target IKKe TBK1 blood , adipose tissue sample . We use phospho-specific antibody evaluate regulation target play role energy metabolism , also feedback inhibition NFkB . These study pave way future evaluation probe metabolic relevance IKKe TBK1 human use agent potent one discover design .</detailed_description>
