	<brief_summary>Obtaining peripheral vascular access medical patient necessary procedure many healthcare provider . Peripheral vascular access traditionally perform use palpation visual inspection identify appropriate point entry vasculature needle catheter thread skin surround fascia vessel interest . This procedure , one common procedures medical field include artery vein access , 100 % successfully attempt . Operator skill heavily influence peripheral vascular cannulation . ( Frisch et al . 2013 ) However , certain patient population difficult peripheral vessel identify palpation visual inspection past operator would force perform procedure blind base anatomical landmark . Recently , aid vascular identification increase cannulation success , number alternative technique peripheral vascular access describe include ultrasound-guided . Ultrasound-guided vascular access utilized vascular access improve success rate . However , even ultrasound guidance first attempt success rate cannulation approximately 65 % . A proposed failure ultrasound guide peripheral vascular access likely due failure advance catheter vessel even vessel successfully puncture . The investigator propose specific technique positive `` Target Sign '' mean obtain almost 100 % successful peripheral vascular access . The investigator plan enroll 100 surgical patient study study procedure differ patient operating room care anesthesia faculty would receive . The study simply way identify step regard specific technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subject ( patient ) bring Main Operating Room time Day Surgery Admissions ( DOSA ) discretion attend physician surgical team . The patient require anything different standard anesthesia surgical practice hospital . Subjects come operating room suite usual monitor ( electrocardiogram , non-invasive blood pressure , oxygen saturation ) place . Prior routine induction anesthesia , peripheral vascular access usually obtain . In regard subject population , peripheral vascular access predict difficult due lack visualization peripheral vessel . The skin prepped chlorhexidine , drape , subsequent procedure perform sterile fashion . The attend physician and/or resident use L25x Sonosite transducer Sonosite Edge® ( Washington , US ) identify peripheral vessel upper extremity cannulation . After identification vessel , operator line L25x Sonosite transducer place vessel horizontally midline Sonosite Edge® screen give available view area . A BD Insyte® Autoguard® 16G shield IV catheter ( Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy Systems Inc. , Utah , US ) advance toward vessel approximately 10˚ angle . Once needle tip identify Sonosite Edge® monitor short axis view , follow step ensue : 1 . Advance needle toward vessel slowly , adjust ultrasound transducer position angle continue keep needle tip vessel identify Sonosite Edge® monitor . 2 . Puncture anterior wall vessel needle tip 3 . Confirm needle tip placement vessel 4 . Advance needle within vessel 5mm continuous visualization 5 . View record confirmation `` Target Sign '' ultrasound monitor 1 . Positive Target Sign=needle tip identify ultrasound monitor within vessel able move freely within vessel , similar circle target middle able move . This confirm needle unrestricted vessel . 2 . Negative Target Sign=needle identify ultrasound monitor within vessel , unable move freely within vessel without drag vessel wall needle movement . This confirm needle transfixed posterior wall vessel 6 . Thread catheter needle . 7 . At point , catheter could advance either without guidewire operator 's discretion Members research team available verbal assistance throughout procedure . Number attempts time successful vessel cannulation measure , start either operator 's finger ultrasound probe make contact patient 's skin . Successful vessel cannulation define flow IV bag saline connection confirmation flow via fluid agitation vessel identify via ultrasound . This procedure incorporate subject standard care extend time operation . At point , patient participation study surgical operation discretion surgical team . The video record Target Sign save give member research team unknowing success cannulation . The member research team decide , base ultrasound video record positive negative Target Sign , cannulation successful unsuccessful . The viewer record his/her answer compare actual result cannulation . Analysis unsuccessful successful cannulation compare Positive Negative Target Sign . No additional long-term followup occur .</detailed_description>
