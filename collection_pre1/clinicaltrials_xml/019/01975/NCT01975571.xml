	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine individual residual low-frequency hearing severe range develop improve speech perception combine residual acoustic hearing electrical processing cochlear implant design stimulate high-frequency basal middle turn cochlea preserve useful low-frequency acoustic hearing . To accomplish , propose implant individual severe hear Cochlear® Nucleus™ Hybrid L24 Implant Cochlear® Nucleus™ Hybrid S12 poorer ear . We believe device less damage Organ Corti structure , long , invasive standard cochlear implant electrode . Two different population study IDE . Population 1 : 15 Adults severe sensorineural hearing loss pure-tone average ( PTA ) 60-90 decibel ( dB ) hear level ( HL ) 125-1500 Hz profound loss high frequency implant Cochlear® Nucleus™ Hybrid L24 Implant . The potential subject present Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant ( CNC ) monosyllabic word score 0-35 % ear implant 60 % understanding contralateral ear best-aided condition . Population 2 : 30 Children ( age 5-12 year ) adolescent ( age 13-15 year ) sensorineural hearing loss pure-tone average ( PTA ) 60-90 dB HL 125-1500 Hz profound loss high frequency implant Cochlear® Nucleus™ Hybrid L24 Implant Cochlear® Nucleus™ Hybrid S12 Implant . Those hearing threshold 60-90 dB HL 1500 Hz would implant less invasive shorter 10 mm Hybrid S12 attempt well preserve middle frequency range . Those hear threshold &gt; 90 dB HL 1500 Hz would receive long 16 mm Hybrid L24 electrode . The potential subject present Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten ( PB-K ) monosyllabic word score 0-50 % ear implant 60 % understanding contralateral ear best-aided condition . Through preserve acoustic hearing , believe subject experience well signal noise ratio speech perception noise , good localization sound improvement music perception . Histological evidence patient implanted standard array experience short electrode array implantation individual significant residual hearing support assumption ( Nadol , Shiao , Burgess , Ketten , Eddington et al. , 2001 ) . The duration study 2 year ( 24 month ) adults 5 year ( 60 month ) child adolescent .</detailed_description>
