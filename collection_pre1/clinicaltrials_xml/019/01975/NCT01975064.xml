	<brief_title>Cancer Anesthesia : Survival After Radical Surgery - Comparison Between Propofol Sevoflurane Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study complete accordance Declaration Helsinki , Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) applicable regulatory requirement . The study include approximately 8,000 pt 10 site Sweden probably also one two international site . The population pt schedule radical breast- colorectal cancer surgery general anesthesia without additional regional anesthesia . A clinically relevant absolute difference five-year-survival would 5 % . Based data retrospective study , 80 % power detect difference 5 % P-value &lt; 0.05 include 7,378 pt ( see ) . By add 8.4 % inclusion , reasonable safety margin loss pt technical error . Breast cancer , expect 5-year survival 87 % vs 82 % : 1,650 pt Colon cancer , expect 5-year survival 60 % vs 55 % : 3,000 pt Rectal cancer , expect 5-year survival 70 % vs 65 % : 2,728 pt Margin loss patient technical error 622 pt Total 8,000 pt . During preoperative anesthetic procedure , pt screen consent study . Demographic data collect connection screening/enrolment . The pt randomize either propofol- sevoflurane anesthesia . The study specific procedure protocol randomization . The product use study well establish register since many year . The manufacturer product use responsible safety monitoring pharmacovigilance purpose accord regulation . It responsibility Investigator site pt , consider candidate study , list `` Screening Enrolment log '' . Pts receive consecutive screening number signing informed consent thereafter consider study patient . Once randomize , also get patient-specific randomization number consider enrolled study . It responsibility investigator keep patient identification list , identify individual study patient . Data collect normal clinic ( demographic , anesthesia- surgical relate data ) quality registry use within oncology ( tumor-specific survival data ) respectively . The source data pt ' Medical Records . The following variable note care pt record : - Demographic variable include habit general health - Age , Gender - Place residence , Zip code ( proxy socioeconomics ) - Length , Weight - Smoking ( pack year ; 1 pack year = 20 cigarettes/day year ) Alcohol ( standard drink ; 1 standard drink = 12 g pure ethanol ) - ASA-grades ( American Society Anesthesiologists ) - Co-morbidity - On-going medication - Other anesthetic last year ( date , duration , type ) - Study specific variable - Randomization , i.e . allocation propofol- sevoflurane-group confirmation hypnotic product use surgery - Anesthesia relate variable - Duration - Doses intraoperative opioids current anesthesia - Other adjuvant intraoperative treatment inotropic drug - Accumulated time mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) 65 130 mmHg - Accumulated hydration balance - Bleeding volume - Transfusions ( red blood cell , plasma ) - Pre-and postoperative laboratory-analyses - Complementary regional blockade ( kind block , type dos local anesthetic ) - Doses postoperative morphine - Re-anesthesia ( type ) - Surgical variable - Cancer location - Date surgery - Duration - The following complication collect 30 day post-surgery - Surgical complication ( intra- postoperative ) receive International Classification Diseases number ( ICD ) - Occurrence follow diagnosis 30 day surgery : myocardial infarction , stroke , pulmonary embolism , pneumonia renal failure The following tumor specific variable transfer cancer quality registries - Tumor data ( stage , proliferation , hormone status ) - Complementary therapy ( radiation , chemotherapy , anti-hormone , antibody , angiogenesis inhibitor ) - Recurrence/metastasis ( localization , time point ) - Re-surgery ( date , duration , indication ) - Date death cause death , applicable No cod perform complication add database ICD number . Uppsala Clinical Research Center ( UCR ) responsible Data Management clinical database write study specific Data Management Plan ( DMP ) detail specify . These activity make accordance Standard Operation Procedures ( SOP ) UCR . An electronic CRF ( eCRF ) use study also serve clinical database study . UCR responsible set-up , support management eCRF . All mention data collect database . This system also include handle Data Clarification Forms ( DCFs ) resolve inconsistency detect quality control procedure . In accordance principle GCP , monitor study arrange Sponsor . UCR appoint Sponsor monitor study . During study , Monitor regular contact study site , include visit ensure study conduct document properly compliance protocol , GCP applicable regulatory requirement . The Monitoring activity make accordance SOP UCR . Both centralized monitoring activity on-site monitoring activity use project . It decide major part monitor make centralized method together continuous telephone contact site limit on-site activity . This decision base nature study - observational study specific procedure randomization . Additionally , investigational product use well establish within clinical practice since many year document safety profile . Each site site initiation ( organize multi-center initiation meet web-based training ) focus provide information study objective , study procedure eCRF-training . Each site least one on-site visit study . Based outcome centralized monitoring activity , frequency on-site monitoring activity may increase . The Monitor review source document verification consistency data record eCRFs random sample pt . In addition , select key variable proofread . All inconsistency detect procedure resolve DCF 's , issue monitor investigational site personnel . Completed DCFs file entered database accordingly . The Monitor also provide information support Investigators . The centralized monitoring use detect siteÂ´s level compliance term completion eCRF generally also focus critical data ( e.g . compliance randomization propofol sevoflurane date surgery ) . The outcome statistical check use indicate whether increased monitoring activity need specific site . In term review complete informed consent , random sample pt check monitor connection on-site visit . Site log complete informed consent on-going basis . This log need distributed monitor on-going basis serve monitor tool consent-process . If sign site comply specify consent-process , extend site-specific training/ increase monitoring activity need . All monitoring procedure , include centralize method on-site activity , describe Monitoring Plan compile collaboration Sponsor . The study center may also subject quality assurance audit Sponsor well inspection Medical Procurement Agency . The Investigator responsible personnel must available monitoring visit , audit inspection devote sufficient time process . Generally , Medical Records/laboratory reports/anesthetic report serve source data . CRF also use source data . A site-specific Origin Source Data-log compile site verify source data . The follow minimum amount information record hospital record : - Clinical study number . - Subject identification . - Date patient information give sign Informed Consent obtain . - Diagnosis . - Fulfillment eligibility criterion . Tumor-specific variable include data survival part database transfer quality registry use within oncology . These quality registry routinely use within oncology part quality assurance care patient ( INCA-platform use ) . The registry handle six Regional Cancer Centers ( RCCs ) . Complete oncologic- outcome data available type cancer include study . In order able link information database , pt ' full personal identification number ( ID ) collect note . It delete data clean merge database ensure anonymity person . All analysis make ID removal . When pt complete ( i.e . completion follow-up 30 day post-surgery ) , data enter database , query solve , Database Closure procedures start . Decisions make classify pt analysis population , handle protocol violation deviate miss data . All decision date documented Database Closure document . After database lock . Any change database thereafter document . Statistical analysis The clinical database transfer Sponsor UCR . Tumor-specific data transfer Sponsor RCC quality register . Sponsor responsible linking database also statistical analysis . In present study endpoint evaluate descriptive method . All variable present aggregated data . Categorical variable summarize frequency table ( present frequency proportion ) type anesthesia . The quantitative variable summarize number observation ( n ) , mean , standard deviation ( SD ) , median , minimum ( min ) maximum ( max ) anesthesia . If applicable , separate summary present patient receive one , two anesthesia , well pooled summary . Graphical method may use wherever regard appropriate . Overall survival time progress present Kaplan-Meier curve together median survival time time progression , respectively . The estimate cumulative 1- 5-year overall survival compare pt give sevoflurane propofol . In next step , Cox Proportional hazard model calculate assess risk death adjust potential effect modifier confounders . There also stratification different type tumor , cardio-pulmonary status , ASA-class etc . Hazard ratios 95 % confidence interval present model .</detailed_description>
