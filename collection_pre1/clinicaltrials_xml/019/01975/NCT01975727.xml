	<brief_summary>Postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) frequent surgery anaesthesia . Dexamethasone widely use antiemetic prevention PONV . Little known efficacy antiemetic drug treatment establish PONV symptom . No single randomise trial publish far test efficacy dexamethasone treatment establish PONV symptom . In trial investigator want test antiemetic efficacy three different dos intravenous dexamethasone treatment establish PONV symptom .

	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Treatment Established Postoperative Nausea Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study divide main study three adjunct protocol : Main study : Postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) frequent adverse effect surgery anesthesia . Dexamethasone well establish prophylaxis PONV , efficacy dexamethasone treatment establish PONV symptom remain unknown . The primary objective main study test antiemetic efficacy dexamethasone treatment establish PONV adult undergo surgery general anaesthesia , test dose-responsiveness . The secondary objective evaluation potential adverse effect profile dexamethasone , No prophylactic antiemetic allow . Premedication , conduct anesthesia postoperative analgesia discretion responsible anesthesiologist . Patients receive assigned study drug continue experience PONV receive antiemetic rescue treatment ( ondansetron , droperidol ) . The minimum delay administration study drug rescue 60 min ( ensure dexamethasone scope show antiemetic efficacy ) . Primary efficacy endpoint : Complete absence nausea and/or vomit ( include retch ) previously nauseate vomit patient within 24 hour administration study treatment . Secondary endpoint : Time treatment failure ; quality sleep first postoperative night ( numerical rating scale range 0 = sleep 10 = excellent sleep ) ; blood glucose ( morning administration study drug ) ; minor major adverse effect 24h . Adjunct protocol 1 : In therapeutic PONV trial , efficacy usually quantify use dichotomous outcome , i.e . previously nauseous vomit patient stay totally PONV-free give period time ( instance , 24 hour ) . This outcome valid endpoint vomiting ( include retch ) : previously vomit patient stay completely vomiting-free treatment . For nausea , situation different . A patient may suffer severe nausea , , treatment , degree nausea may significantly decrease although nausea may disappear completely . Nevertheless , treatment may regard efficacious . A similar context find postoperative pain set efficacious analgesic may decrease degree pain significant extent although pain disappear completely . In analgesic trial , efficacy therefore express dichotomous outcome ( pain - pain ) continuum 0 100 mm visual analogue scale . Patients moderate severe postoperative pain ( VAS ≥3/10 ) would randomise receive experimental control ( placebo ) intervention relief would record time . Outcomes express maximum pain relief , area time-analgesic effect curve pain intensity ( i.e . sum pain intensity difference , SPID ) , sum pain relief ( TOTPAR ) . AIM : To apply methodology acute pain trial measurement anti-nausea efficacy antiemetic drug . To investigate variability response base measurement nausea intensity use visual analogue scale compare 4-point categorical scale . METHODS : Patients main study protocol ask rate degree `` baseline '' nausea 100 mm visually analogue scale range 0 mm = nausea 100 mm = worst possible nausea , 4-point categorical scale ( none , moderate , severe , intolerable ) . Subsequently , receive assigned study drug , patient ask score degree nausea VAS every 15 minute 60 minute administration study drug ( i.e . would receive rescue medication ) . Adjunct protocol 2 : Pharmacogenetics PONV . Knowledge mechanisms underlie inter-individual difference PONV need well identify patient risk PONV . Some variability see nausea vomit cancer migraine without aura may associate genetic variation either gene relate mechanism nausea/vomiting gene relate opioid action . In cancer patient receive opioids , inter-individual difference nausea vomit associate genetic marker represent single nucleotide polymorphism candidate opioid- nausea/vomiting signal pathway modulate neurotransmission metabolise catecholamine dopamine . A possible role suggest catechol-O-methyl-transferase ( COMT ) key modulator metabolism endogenous monoaminergic neurotransmitter , hence opioidergic neurotransmitter . The COMT enzyme possess frequent non-synonymous polymorphism encode substitution valine ( Val ) methionine ( Met ) codon 158 ( Val158Met ) . The SNP rs4680 ( c.472G &gt; A ) missense mutation lead four-fold reduction COMT enzyme . Individuals Val/Val genotype high activity COMT , Met/Met genotype low activity COMT , heterozygous individual intermediate.11,12 Pathways involve specific neurotransmitter receptor likely involved PONV , instance , dopamine , acetylcholine , histamine , cannabinoids , substance P , 5-hydroxytryptamine . The role dopamine pivotal nausea vomiting ; dopamine D2 receptor blockade , area postrema , antiemetic effect . In patient receive COMT inhibitor , enhance dopaminergic activity lead dose-dependently frequent severe nausea vomit . AIM : To compare COMT genotype patient PONV PONV-free control assess possible relationship genetic factor dexamethasone response . A great proportion COMT-deficient allele expect PONV patient compare PONV-free control . METHODS : The study population consist patient PONV include main study ( n=560 ) . The control group 560 consenting patient develop PONV . COMT genotyping : Genomic DNA extract 200 µl whole blood use QIAamp DNA blood mini kit ( QIAGEN , Hombrechtikon , Switzerland ) . The COMT Val158Met polymorphism ( rs4680 ) genotyped use commercially available TaqMan® SNP genotyping assay ( C_25746809_50 , Applied Biosystems , Warrington , UK ) . Twenty-five µl reaction perform use 50 ng template DNA , pre-designed PCR primer TaqMan® MGB probe ( FAMTM VIC® dye-labelled ) accord manufacturer 's instruction TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix use iCycler iQ detection system ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Analyses : The investigator analyse allele genotype frequency , Hardyweinberg equilibrium , linkage disequilibrium haplotype . The individual SNPs haplotypes association occurrence PONV categorize analyzed Fisher exact test Chi-square test regression analysis ( logistic , univariate multivariate ) . Gene-gene interaction relation PONV assess multivariate regression analysis . Analyses perform use Haploview software v1 . ( Broad Institute , Cambridge , USA ) SPSS ( version 19 ; SPSS Inc , Chicag0 , IL ) . Adjunct protocol 3 : Role non-smoking status predictive factor PONV . BACKGROUND : Non-smoking status consistently report independent predictive risk factor PONV . At first view , empirical observation interesting . However , two unresolved issue . Firstly , remain unclear , non-smoking patient increase risk PONV , consequently , smoke patient `` protect '' . For instance , investigator fail show benefit ( short-term ) perioperative transcutaneous nicotine administration prevention PONV . Secondly , PONV risk score show satisfactory sensitivity specificity , largely limit clinical applicability . It argue one weakness score non-smoking status ill define treat purely dichotomous fashion . For instance , remain unclear length abstinence formerly PONV-protective effect lose ex-smokers . Also , remain unknown whether `` heavy '' smoker '' protect . Finally , various way consume tobacco ; tobacco snuffing also show decrease risk PONV . AIMS : 1 . To test whether risk PONV differs non- , ex- current smoker . 2 . To test whether dose-effect relationship amount tobacco smoking , risk PONV . 3 . To test ex-smokers relationship duration smoke cessation risk PONV . METHODS : Patients participate main study ask , pre-operatively , fill questionnaire regard smoke habit . Patients classify non-smokers ( expose passive smoking ) , ex-smokers ( stop &gt; 1 month ; expose passive smoking ; substitute ) , smoker . Variables related PONV smoking ( potential confounders ) record .</detailed_description>
