Multiple study show mindfulness level increase response mindfulness training , increase mindfulness mediates effect mindfulness intervention health outcome . Consistent goal PA-11-329 `` determine influence complementary alternative medicine approach develop sustain healthy behavior habit child youth '' multi-PI application seek study role mindfulness train promote maintain healthy dietary physical activity habit .

Innovative aspect proposal include study effect mindfulness training health behavior among youth development new model link mindfulness , impulsivity behavioral change population .
