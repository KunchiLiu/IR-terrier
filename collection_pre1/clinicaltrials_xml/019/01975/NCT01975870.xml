	<detailed_description>Recent scientific research show prolonged sitting , also call sedentary behavior may adverse effect health . An increase negative association find cardio-metabolic risk factor , type 2 diabetes premature mortality . The occurrence adverse health effect even appear independently degree physical activity . There evidence interrupt prolong sit regularly . Until today still international scientific standard specifies often sit behavior interrupt . Moreover , also unclear long break take counter adverse health effect . Only study examine health effect intervention aim reduce sit behavior . Currently , great need intervention one make aware problem sedentarity , , one equally encourage change behavior short well long term . In proposed project investigator therefore contribute good method fight sedentary behavior innovative way . The investigator try achieve goal development implementation application smartphone . Recent figure show impossible ignore existence smartphone application . In 2011 40.4 % Flemish people own smartphone . In year 650 000 smartphones sell Belgium . In 2012 , accord projection number increase 250 % 1.625 000 . The smartphone popular tool use adoption healthy lifestyle . There meanwhile lot sport exercise apps measure physical activity ( eg Runkeeper Pro Fitness Builder ) give information around physical activity . Motion sensor , standard built-in smartphone , often use purpose . In development app associate process project , principles Self Determination Theory ( SDT ) take account . This theoretical framework make possible aim change behavior short long term . During development app , investigator respect sense autonomy , competence social connectedness user . Recent research show already application generate awareness regular interval supply reminder , autonomy trust competency respect , effective reduce sedentary behavior . The effectiveness application investigate mean control intervention study . In study , control- intervention group 30 participant include . At begin project , intervention group control group fill scientific questionnaire sedentary behavior ( pre-test ) . 1. st week : During one week , control- intervention group wear activity monitor ( ActivPal ) . In way , investigator determine degree physical activity sedentary behavior . 2. nd week : After week , control group ask change lifestyle . The person control group still wear activity monitor . The intervention group use app week time person intervention group carry activity monitor . They choose use application ( prefer , depend profile eg advice versus daily advice receive ) . After 2nd week , control intervention group invite fill questionnaire ( post-test ) . Data activity monitor retrieve . Now investigators examine sedentary behavior intervention group significantly decrease use app , compare sedentary behavior control group . Moreover , investigator also examine whether way use app ( cfr profile ) effect result .</detailed_description>
