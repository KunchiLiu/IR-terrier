	<brief_summary>Acute pain relief emergency set still public health priority . Pain primary reason emergency room use , situation `` oligo-analgesia '' persist country . Intravenous morphine titration become standard method severe acute pain management emergency department , still insufficiently implement . Deviations recommend protocol common : initial additional loading dos , unusually extended interval bolus , premature discontinuation . Several factor contribute difficulty : heaviness setting , especially overcrowd case , procedure rigidity , high consumption nursing time . This method require systematic intravenously route , several inconvenients : algogenic procedure , couple initial diagnostic venous sampling ( delay analgesia ) , excessive `` medicalization '' ambulatory patient ( risk infection less mobility emergency department ) . An alternative reduce analgesic latency emergency department , without lose benefit tolerance safety welcome . The inhaled route look promising , yet enough evaluated adult , even less emergency room . Aerosol technique change one study another ( molecule , material , dos , painful intensity include , judgment criterion assessment time ) . A morphine titration aerosol therapy could interest alternative standard method disadvantage , use faster , painless easy procedure , lead `` demedicalization '' . To need strong fundamental , additional study design healthy volunteer . The objective compare titration intravenous morphine titration aerosol moderate acute pain cause electrostimulation . To purchase aim , first need determine accurately small dose effective well tolerate inhaled morphine , provide `` bolus '' dose repeat titration , still currently unknown . This dose call ED50 , 's effective dose least 50 % healthy volunteer relieve . ED50 intravenous morphine also need establish , unknown indication . The determination two parallel ED50 would allow reliable conversion factor two route administration morphine `` bolus '' , test comparative titration . To validate induced pain model healthy volunteer , also choose fix condition ED50 fentanyl effective dose nebulization well know . This study would also describe pharmacokinetics inhaled morphine derivative single spray .</brief_summary>
