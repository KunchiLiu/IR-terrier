	<brief_summary>Most Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patient commonly live well adulthood , mean progressively accumulating damage insulin-secreting cell inside pancreas . This explain adult patient degree abnormal sugar regulation &amp; rate diabetes rise significantly age . CF related diabetes categorically different type diabetes &amp; development serious herald faster decline lung function &amp; reduced life expectancy . The hallmark abnormal sugar handle CF high glucose level meal damage pancreas responds abnormally slowly . Over 70 % initial response healthy pancreas induce , glucose alone , hormone release bowel know incretins . We want establish whether incretins important blood sugar handle CF specific drug enhance effect available . The study hypothesis incretin system function normally patient Cystic Fibrosis . To show measure much insulin secretion dependant incretin hormone CF patient compare level sugary drink test intravenous glucose drip test ( run rate mimic blood sugar level obtain first test make fair comparison ) - incretins produce first test sugar pass bowel extra insulin produce due hormone . To detect resistance incretin hormone separately measure response direct infusion hormone . We explore component meal cause incretin hormone release bowel wall measure blood level different type meal consume . Finally measure level enzyme break incretin hormone ( DPP-4 ) know deactivate quickly people CF . By describe incretin system CF considerably improve understand important condition well potentially highlight new way treat .</brief_summary>
