	<brief_summary>VATS anatomical lung resection provide effective minimally invasive treatment strategy stage I II lung cancer . VATS lobectomy associate significantly less postoperative atrial fibrillation , blood transfusion , renal failure , complication compare lobectomy via thoracotomy . Although VATS lobectomy proven effective safe experience hand , devoid risk . Intra-operative surgical complication time catastrophic . Currently , spite safe effective technique experience hand , minority anatomical pulmonary resection perform VATS . The technical difficulty increase actual perceived danger VATS lobectomy relate PA branch manipulation main limitation many thoracic surgeon regard adoption VATS lobectomy practise . Furthermore , majority VATS lobectomies perform high volume , academic medical center resultant disparity socioeconomic status undergo VATS versus open lobectomy . If find way decrease manipulation require surgeon PA branch , procedure safer , less stressful surgeon therefore prevalent anatomical pulmonary resection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intraoperative technique differ standard resection technique blood vessel ligation perform accord standard operative procedure either use endostaplers direct ligation pulmonary vessel . After resection removal resect specimen , specimen examine ex-vivo , operative field non-sterile field operative room . The lobar PA main segmental branch sharply dissect . Cannulation major segmental PA branch perform use pressurization monitoring device . The cannulation secure 2-0 silk suture . The vascular pressurization record device describe section E outline Figures 4 5 . All pressure measurement record graphed related time initial vascular pressurization PA bursting pressure . All distal segmental branch PA ligate maintain pressure throughout catheterized segmental branch . An initial pressure 25 mmHg obtain inflating vessel normal saline . The lobar PA main segmental branch ' diameter measure vascular adventitia adventitia . The lobar PA main segmental artery seal use Harmonic Scalpel Ace+ . The sealing perform intravascular pressure 25 mmHg order simulate normal human PA pressure . Following division PA , normal saline solution inject controlled pressure syringe pump order achieve intralumenal vascular pressure bursting pressure reach . Intralumenal pressure record frequency 10 time per second . The bursting pressure record . Ex-vivo experimentation take approximately 20 30 minute . Burst pressure in-vivo endo-stapled ( Endopath® ETS , 35mm , 2.5mm staple , white cartridge ; Ethicon , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA ) main lobar PA branch evaluate recorded ex-vivo specimen . Endo-stapled vessel utilized size-matched control energy seal vessel 1:2 ratio . Allotment staple energy seal group base vascular size measurement prior seal . Attempts make use in-vivo staple line control vessel possible case ( size permit ) order increase sample size energy seal vessel . Following vascular sealing , experimentation recording , specimen send pathological evaluation resect lesion . All specimen manipulation strictly perform proximal main PA branch , away resect tumour . Care take affect pathological integrity resect lesion surround tissue lymph node . Experimentation perform direct supervision attend thoracic surgeon order assure integrity specimen pathological analysis . Analysis consist group comparison efficacies burst pressure energy seal vessel ( experimental group ) endostapler-sealed vessel ( control group ) . Vessels stratify luminal diameter millimeter . Primary outcome analysis intergroup comparison mean PA burst pressure size vessel . Intergroup difference compare student 's t-test bursting pressure enter continuous variable . Statistical test normality data perform data non-normal , non-parametric method ( ex : Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test… ) use . Multivariable linear regression model employ order compare burst pressure group control potential confounders ( disease state , size vessel seal , age patient , sex , pulmonary lobe , laterality , immunosupression , diabetes , vascular disease… ) .</detailed_description>
