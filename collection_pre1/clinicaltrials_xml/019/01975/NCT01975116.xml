	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish whether adult recommend phase II dose 3x/week bolus infusion p28is safe pediatric patient recurrent/refractory central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor . II . To describe dose-limiting toxicity 3x/week bolus infusion p28 pediatric patient recurrent/refractory CNS tumor . III . To evaluate characterize plasma pharmacokinetics p28 child recurrent/ refractory CNS tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe context phase I trial observe antitumor activity p28 . II . To investigate level p53 clinical tumor specimens patient pediatric gliomas pediatric CNS tumor treat p28 . III . To document type/site ( ) p53 mutation tumor tissue specimen . IV . To evaluate characterize intratumoral pharmacokinetics p28 child recurrent/ refractory CNS tumor , available . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive azurin-derived cell-penetrating peptide p28 intravenously ( IV ) 15 minute thrice weekly 4 week . Treatment repeat every 6 week 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day .</detailed_description>
