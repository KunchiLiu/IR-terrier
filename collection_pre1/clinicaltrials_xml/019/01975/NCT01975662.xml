	<brief_summary>The aim study compare efficacy daptomycin treatment versus vancomycin treatment treatment methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) bloodstream infection ( BSI ) due isolates high vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) ( i.e . &gt; equal 1.5 ug/ml ) term reduce all-cause mortality . Our secondary aim compare clinical failure rate daptomycin treatment versus vancomycin treatment compare time microbiological clearance patient treat daptomycin versus treat vancomycin . Our primary hypothesis Daptomycin treatment superior vancomycin treatment reduce mortality BSIs due MRSA high vancomycin MIC 25 % 10 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vancomycin Versus Daptomycin Treatment Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) Bacteremia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction/Clinical Significance Vancomycin standard first-line treatment methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) bacteremia . In recent year however , increase number MRSA isolate high vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) . Recent consensus guideline recommend clinician consider use alternative agent daptomycin MRSA infection vancomycin MIC great 1 ug/ml . To date however , head head randomize trial compare safety efficacy daptomycin vancomycin treatment blood stream infection ( BSIs ) due MRSA high vancomycin MICs . Specific Aims : Our primary aim compare efficacy daptomycin treatment versus vancomycin treatment treatment MRSA BSIs due isolates high vancomycin MICs ( i.e . &gt; equal 1.5 ug/mL ) term reduce all-cause mortality . Our secondary aim compare clinical failure rate daptomycin treatment versus vancomycin treatment compare time microbiological clearance patient treat daptomycin versus treat vancomycin . Hypothesis : Daptomycin treatment superior vancomycin treatment reduce mortality BSIs due MRSA high vancomycin MIC 25 % 10 % . Methodology We conduct prospective open label randomize control phase 2B pilot study 3 major Singaporean hospital , balance treatment assignment within hospital achieve permuted block randomization . There 21 subject per arm , control arm receiving vancomycin experimental arm receiving daptomycin . The primary objective compare efficacy daptomycin treatment versus vancomycin treatment treatment MRSA BSIs due isolates high vancomycin MICs ( i.e . &gt; equal 1.5 ug/mL ) term reduce all-cause mortality 60 day positive index blood culture . Secondary outcome include rate clinical failure , time microbiological clearance , rate nephro- muscular toxicity arm . If pilot study prove hypothesis indeed , aim proceed large scale trial</detailed_description>
