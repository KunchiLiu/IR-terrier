	<brief_title>A Phase 1B Dose-escalation Phase 2a Study TRC105 Combination With Pazopanib Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pazopanib oral inhibitor multiple receptor tyrosine kinase , include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 therapeutic plasma concentration . These receptor implicate pathologic angiogenesis , tumor growth , cancer progression . Pazopanib approve treatment advance soft tissue sarcoma , follow progression one prior systemic therapy , base improved progression free survival . TRC105 antibody CD105 , important angiogenic target vascular endothelial cell distinct VEGFR . TRC105 inhibit angiogenesis , tumor growth metastases preclinical model complement activity bevacizumab multi-kinase inhibitor target VEGFR . In phase 1 study advance solid tumor , TRC105 therapy cause global reduction angiogenic biomarkers reduce tumor burden dose well-tolerated . In phase 1b study , combination TRC105 bevacizumab produce radiographic reduction tumor volume bevacizumab-refractory patient , well tolerate . TRC105 potentiate bevacizumab VEGFR tyrosine kinase ( VEGFR TKI ) preclinical model . By target non-VEGF pathway upregulated follow VEGF inhibition , TRC105 potential complement VEGFR TKIs could represent major advance cancer therapy . Together , use TRC105 pazopanib may result effective angiogenesis inhibition improve clinical efficacy see pazopanib alone .</detailed_description>
