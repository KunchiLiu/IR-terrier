	<brief_summary>Introduction : In United Kingdom ( UK ) , 838,000 men 394,000 woman myocardial infarction ( MI ) need secondary prevention medication . Longterm adherence secondary prevention therapy remain poor , nonadherence medication MI patient range 13-60 % ( 1 ) . Studies show approximately one fourth cardiac patient refill cardiac medication ( 2 ) . Strategies tackle burden non adherence could involve pharmacy care The New Medicine Service ( service provide community pharmacist help patient long term medication chronic disease ) motivational interview incorporate part counsel session community pharmacist . Communication health provider patient health provider could also important strategy improve adherence . Cardiovascular disease high ethnic group well general populationÍ¾ however South Asians high prevalence coronary heart disease ( CHD ) ( 3 ) . In addition , South Asians develop CHD young age , often age 40 year ( 3 ) . Aim study : This study investigate feasibility potential impact pharmacy care intervention involve motivational interview referral New Medicine Service coronary heart disease patient adherence secondary prevention medication outcomes coronary heart disease . Method : The study design prospective , control feasibility/pilot , intervention study . The study two phase . In intervention phase total 200 coronary heart disease patient discharge London Chest Hospital enrol study follow one year . Pharmacies six London Boroughs invite take place study . Pharmacies randomise use table random number intervention site control site . The pharmacist work intervention pharmacy invite train delivery intervention motivational interviewing . The intervention perform community pharmacist . Recruitment patient take place hospital . In interview phase 20 patient South Asian background invite telephone interview study effect belief cultural background regard adherence cardiac medication . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure self report adherence coronary artery disease medication employ standard validate measure .
