	<detailed_description>This small Phase I trial evaluate safety use skin test antigen immunologically active protein soluble/cytosol insoluble cell wall Mycobacterium leprae . The overall objective generate new leprosy skin-test antigen , equivalent tuberculin-PPD tuberculosis context , use ( I ) early diagnosis leprosy ; ( ii ) epidemiological tool measure incidence disease . Evaluating new leprosy skin test antigen may provide good way diagnose leprosy early stage infection . With early administration drug therapy , infected individual cure disease nerve damage occur nodule ( lepromas ) start develop skin . Ten healthy , leprosy-unexposed , tuberculin-negative volunteer , age 18-40 year old , within staff Mycobacteria Research Laboratories , Department Microbiology , Colorado State University , Fort Collins , Colorado , select study . The volunteer recruit direct contact place notice Department Microbiology Colorado State University . There approximately 40 faculty/staff/students population routinely test ( PPD skin-testing chest X-ray ) staff Hartshorn Health Service Center context Department 's tuberculosis research . Five individual select test MLSA-LAM five receive MLCwA . Each receive single 0.1 ml intracutaneous injection three titrate dos ( 1 , 10 25 ) lg/ml ) skin-test antigen , one mock antigen ( i.e. , physiological saline ) , one control antigen ( product use ; Rees MLSA , 10 ) lg ) , divide equally subject 's two arm . Results record 15 min , 48 h , 72 h , 28 day post-injection . The test dose administer sterile1 ml syringe calibrate tenth fit sterile , one-half inch , 26 27 gauge needle . The rubber stopper vial wipe sterile piece cotton moisten alcohol allow dry.It expect concentration two leprosy skin test antigen evoke similar negative response . If , three concentration use subsequent study . This protocol link study 98-202 .</detailed_description>
