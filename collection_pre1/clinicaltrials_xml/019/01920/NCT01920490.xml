	<brief_summary>The investigator show decouple brain network feel guilty first potential functional neuroimaging biomarker risk major depression . It remain detectable remission symptom ( Green et al. , 2012 ) . Decoupling neural network find people felt guilty functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) relative feel indignation . Guilt-selective brain decouple therefore excellent target intervention reduce largely increase risk recurrent episode people one episode currently remit . To knowledge , however , proof-of-concept study show self-blame-selective decoupling fMRI detect feed back participant short temporal delay real-time fMRI set whether couple increase neurofeedback training . This project aim develop first fMRI neurofeedback system treat self-blame-selective neural decouple test feasibility people major depressive disorder currently remit symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific aim 1 : Demonstrate anterior temporal lobe ( ATL ) -septal/subgenual cingulate ( SCSR ) couple guilt increase one session neurofeedback group see visual feedback base increase correlation guilt condition compare group see visual feedback base keep correlation level guilt condition . Specific aim 2 : Demonstrate increase couple selective guilt relative indignation . Specific aim 3 : Demonstrate mood negatively affect neurofeedback . Specific aim 4 : Explore whether short intervention decrease self-hate Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire ( Portuguese translation ) increase self-esteem Rosenberg scale ( show significant correlation SCSR-ATL couple across major depressive disorder control group Manchester study ) , measure available , decrease negative affect Positive Negative Affect Scale .</detailed_description>
