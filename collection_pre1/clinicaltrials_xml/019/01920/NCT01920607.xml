	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare 2 surgical treatment severe fecal incontinence ( defined major leak per week ) . The hypothesis `` non-inferiority '' trial magnetic anal sphincter clinically effective SNS , cost-effective manage fecal incontinence</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medical Economic Evaluation Magnetic Anal Sphincter Patients With Severe Anal Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe anal incontinence , define uncontrolled passing stool least week , problem serious impact quality life . In event failure conservative treatment , surgery help improve continence problem significant number case . Sacral nerve stimulation currently standard surgical treatment severe anal incontinence sphincter repair ( sphincteroplasty ) recommend . A new method treatment base sphincter reinforcement implant band magnetic beads* , prove reliable efficient small series case , particularly failure sacral nerve stimulation . The aim trial , compare `` magnetic anal sphincter* sacral nerve stimulation '' homogeneous population patient affect severe anal incontinence define position new approach treatment algorithm functional disorder , determine clinical medical/economic advantage compare current standard treatment . * FenixTM ( Torax Medical )</detailed_description>
