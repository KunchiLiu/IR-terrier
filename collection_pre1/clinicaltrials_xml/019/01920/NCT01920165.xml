	<brief_title>Smoking Ban Paediatric Hospital Admissions Respiratory Tract Infections England</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary research question : Has rate hospital admission acute respiratory tract infection ( RTIs ) among child age 14 year decrease follow 1 July 2007 introduction ban smoke public place England ? Study design : Interrupted time series design Study population : The population risk number child age 14 year live England time study period . The age restriction apply minimise potential effect self-smoking outcome . Intervention : The intervention study ban smoke enclose public place implement England 1 July 2007 . Study period : The study period 1 January 2001 31 December 2012 . This maximum time period surround ban 's introduction denominator ( population risk ) numerator ( number hospitalisation ) data available data source geographical area level require . Outcome : The primary outcome rate unplanned hospital admission acute RTIs . Secondary outcome include rate unplanned hospital admission acute upper RTIs ( URTIs ) , rate unplanned hospital admission acute low RTIs ( LRTIs ) . Admissions contain diagnosis URTI LRTI count LRTI . The secondary outcome thus mutually exclusive . The following International Classification Diseases ( ICD ) -10 code use identify acute RTIs : URTIs : A37 , H66-H67 , J02.0 , J00-J06 , J09-J11 ( exclude J10.0 , J11.0 ) LRTIs : J10.0 , J11.0 , J12-J18 , J20-J22 , J40-J42 Only unplanned hospitalisation either primary first secondary diagnosis acute RTI record , include . Admissions primary diagnosis asthma exclude prevent overlap previous study assess impact English smoking ban paediatric asthma hospitalisation . Transfers hospital follow initial admission include . As unique patient identifier available source database , possible distinguish first subsequent admission individual child . Data source : Data number unplanned hospital admission acute RTIs derive Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) database govern Health Social Care Information Centre ( HSCIC ) . HES contain individual-level data hospital admission National Health Services ( NHS ) hospital across England . Mid-year population estimate define population risk obtain Office National Statistics ( ONS ) . Data extraction handling : The number unplanned hospital admission acute RTIs among child age 0-14 year extract HES aggregate HSCIC stratum base possible combination follow covariates : age group ( 0-4 year ; 5-9 year ; 10-14 year ) , sex ( male ; female ) , Middle Super Output Area ( MSOA ) , admission month , admission year . MSOA geographical indicator area 5,000 15,000 inhabitant . A count variable indicate correspond number hospitalisation thus assign stratum . Mid-year population estimate accord stratum base possible combination covariates extract . Monthly population estimate calculate via linear extrapolation mid-year estimate . The following additional covariates obtain link specific indicator MSOA-level : region , urbanisation level , socioeconomic status ( SES ) . MSOA drop covariate count aggregate stratum base combination follow covariates : age group , sex , region , urbanisation level , SES , admission month , admission year . RTI hospitalisation rate calculate stratum . Sample size : Sample size calculation time-oriented analysis complicate give complexity model , way redundant give nationwide data use current study . No prior study specifically evaluate change number hospital admission respiratory infection among child follow introduction smoke-free legislation . In previous epidemiological evaluation Scottish smoking ban highly significant ( p &lt; 0.001 ) annual drop asthma hospitalisation 18 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 15-22 ) find among child &lt; 15 year age . Meta-analyses observational study indicate second-hand smoke exposure associate high risk respiratory tract infection infancy ( OR 1.54 ( 95 % CI 1.40-1.69 ) low respiratory tract infection infancy 1.62 ( 95 % CI 1.33-1.97 ) middle ear disease childhood ) compare incident current asthma child ( OR 1.21 ( 95 % CI 1.08-1.36 ) , 1.30 ( 95 % CI 1.22-1.39 ) , respectively . This indicate smoke-free legislation likely large effect acute respiratory infection asthma . Furthermore , paediatric hospital admission acute respiratory infection common asthma , study period current study longer compare previous asthma study . Therefore , current study expect ample power detect significant clinically relevant drop hospitalisation respiratory infection , present . Statistical analysis : Relevant population determinant describe pre postban period . Aggregated hospitalisation rate model study period use interrupted time series approach . Changes follow introduction smoke-free legislation study , take account seasonal pattern RTI rate potential effect relevant covariates ( age group , sex , region , urbanisation level , SES ) . Final model selection base correct Aikaike 's Information Criterion ( cAIC ) . On 4 September 2006 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine ( PCV ) introduce childhood immunisation schedule 2 , 4 , 13 month age , catch-up programme child bear 5 September 2004 . The relative contribution true pneumococcal infection total burden admission respiratory infection , majority likely viral aetiology , expect small . However , consider close temporal proximity PCV introduction smoke ban sensitivity analysis perform study potential effect impact estimation smoking ban . All analysis perform primary secondary outcome use Stata 12.0 .</detailed_description>
