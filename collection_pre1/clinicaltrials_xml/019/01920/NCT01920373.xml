	<brief_summary>1.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES 1.1 Osteoarthritis continuous entirely physiologic adaptive process occur every joint . These include replication cell produce matrix , enzymes , protease inhibitor , cytokine , peptide . Along synthesis new tissue release breakdown product synovial fluid . Enzymes phagocytes required clear breakdown product . Normal tissue turnover involve synthesis breakdown well-regulated balance . In degenerative state balance upset produce inflammation-derived alteration synovium , cartilage , capsule , tendon , bone . Common cause alteration include increased loading , physical stress , traumatic injury joint . 1.2 The rationale use corticosteroid temporomandibular joint therapy inhibit prostaglandin synthesis decrease activity collagenase enzymes degrade articular cartilage . Platelet rich plasma novel therapeutic agent several potential advantage corticosteroids treatment degenerative pathology temporomandibular joint . Platelet rich plasma show anti-inflammatory , analgesic , anti-bacterial property . It also restore intra-articular hyaluronic acid , increase glycosaminoglycan condrocyte synthesis , balance joint angiogenesis , provide scaffold stem cell migration . Autologous platelet rich plasma injection treatment knee cartilage degenerative lesion osteoarthritis show longer efficacy hyaluronic acid injection reduce pain recover articular function . Similarly , platelet rich plasma show well outcome corticosteroid injection management lateral epicondylitis , good outcome hyaluronic acid injection management osteochondral lesion talus . 1.3 Current treatment degeneration osteoarthritis temporomandibular joint focus primarily palliation reduce inflammation inflammatory mediator . This study seek validate therapeutic agent potential actively prevent progression degeneration addition reduce pain inflammation</brief_summary>
