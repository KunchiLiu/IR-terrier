	<brief_summary>Sleep disturbance posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) common condition return Veterans , condition know increase risk cardiovascular disease . Research suggest insomnia triple risk high blood pressure compare normal sleeper , insomnia short sleep increase risk five time normal sleeper . These research finding suggest recently deploy Veterans insomnia may increase risk develop high blood pressure , possibility consistent previous research . Vietnam era Veterans combat-related PTSD assess 1985 twice likely die early-onset heart disease relative non-PTSD counterpart reassess 2000 . Evidence impair cardiac function individual PTSD demonstrate across several study well . Compared individual without PTSD , PTSD seem less reaction stress term heart rate heart beat pattern . However , little research examine impact behavioral sleep intervention health outcome , even few specific PTSD Veteran population . The purpose study determine treat insomnia result improve blood pressure cardiac function recently deploy Veterans PTSD . The finding research serve pilot data future grant application test efficacy Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Insomnia ( CBTI ) reduce cardiovascular risk Veterans PTSD use full-scale randomized trial design . We hypothesize improved sleep significantly associate improved blood pressure increase heart rate variability ( improved autonomic function ) adult receive CBTI compare wait-list control condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance one common complaint recently deploy Veterans , many 64 % deploy Iraq Afghanistan return insomnia . The sleep complaint young Veterans military personnel likely explain combination factor , include : sleep schedule variability require military service ; vigilance necessary remain alert combat situation ; sleep disturbance stem directly traumatic combat experience ; name . Among deployed Operation Enduring Freedom Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OEF/OIF/OND ) , 30 % meet criterion posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) upon return shortly thereafter , Veterans ( 90 % ) likely endorse sleep maintenance problem . Indeed , PTSD often manifest combination insomnia , short sleep duration , nightmare . There burgeon literature show association insomnia hypertension , research suggest insomnia triple risk HTN relative normal sleeper , combination insomnia short sleep duration increase risk five time normal sleeper . These finding suggest recently deploy Veterans insomnia may increase risk develop HTN , research Veterans earlier eras military service consistent possibility . Vietnam era Veterans combat-related PTSD assess 1985 twice likely die early-onset heart disease relative non-PTSD counterpart reassess 2000 . In spite finding significant sleep disturbance young adult , historical evidence increase cardiovascular disease Vietnam-era Veterans PTSD , data sleep disturbance blood pressure young ever-increasing population recently deploy Veterans lack . Evidence impair cardiac function individual PTSD demonstrate across several study , include examine heart rate variability ( HRV ) . Individuals PTSD find low HRV high rest heart rate . The PI propose study conduct pilot research demonstrate intervention trauma-related sleep disturbance improve sleep Veterans PTSD . The purpose propose project line research determine treat sleep disturbance improve blood pressure heart rate variability young adult PTSD .</detailed_description>
