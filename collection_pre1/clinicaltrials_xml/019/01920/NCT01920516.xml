	<brief_summary>In-transit metastasis occur approximately 3 % melanoma patient , symptomatic survival group may prolong . In-transit melanoma metastasis often confine limb . In circumstance , treatment isolate limb perfusion isolate limb infusion remarkably effective regional treatment option . Isolated limb infusion ( ILI ) introduce 1992 technique use deliver regional chemotherapy treat advance melanoma confine limb . Regional chemotherapy melphalan deliver isolated limb perfusion ( ILP ) ILI effective treatment option in-transit melanoma generally well tolerate . ILI less invasive simpler alternative ILP . Complete response rate 45- 69 % ILP 23-44 % ILI . The limb often warm low temperature ILI compare ILP limb become progressively hypoxic acidotic ILI , parameter potentially effect outcome . ILP &amp; ILI use primarily palliative option excision in-transit metastasis unfeasible used adjunctive procedure surgery , tumour type merkel cell carcinoma , repeat indicated . For ILI correction melphalan dose ideal body weight show substantially decrease rate severe local toxicity maintain complete response rate , overall response rate reduce . Response ILI , moreover , different upper low limb . ILI Upper limbs disease associate similar complete response rate low toxicity ILI Lower limbs E disease different physiologic sequela despite comparable method . The Upper limb appear relatively resistant toxic effect melphalan-based ILI currently perform , suggest potential optimization drug dose Upper limb ILI . Regional therapy excellent therapeutic modality disease limit limb furthermore serve excellent model scientific investigation , clinical translational . In study want collect data isolate limb infusion chemotherapy monitor efficacy tolerability patient melanoma metastasis arm leg remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This observational study treatment related experience economical availability center . Study Design : Prospective observational study . Primary objective : To collect data tumor response progression free survival administration melphalan . Secondary objective : To collect data survival rate , time progression , morbidity tolerability treatment , number treatment require achieve objective response improvement quality life ( Edmonton questionnaire ) Treatment observation : Patients undergo fluoroscopic placement angiographic arterial venous catheter appropriate extremity order infuse drug ( artery ) stop flow ( venous balloon catheter ) . Melphalan 1mg/kgr rapidly infuse isolated limb via arterial catheter inflation venous balloon catheter . Then circulation limb block pneumatic cuff root limb . Patients little response 8 week may receive 2 additional treatment discretion treat physician . Patients follow 1-2 week , 3-4 week , 6-8 week , every 3-6 month thereafter deem necessary treating physician . Day -1 Melphalan 1mg/ Kgr prepare Pharmacy . Day 0 : prehydration , antibiotic prophylaxis set therapeutic scheme appropriate analgesic prophylaxis ( 3-day duration ) previously report ( 25 ) Day +1 : Upon admittance radiology room , 1 vial tropisetron ( diluted 100ml physiological solution ) administer slow drip . During infusion Melphalan artery , 1 vial morphine hydrochloride dilute 100 ml i.v . repeat one hour procedure necessary also 6 hour . Tropisetron i.v . need . Intra-arterial premedication 1 vial verapamil dilute 4 ml normal saline solution follow 4 ml lidocaine . Intra femoral infusion Melphalan Second ILI treatment could repeat side effect recovery ( follow oncologist ' planning cure ) . Day +30 : The procedure repeat . Day +90 : In case response , third administration follow procedure repeat . Evaluation response : Response must assess repeat follow examination Day 30 , Day 90 Day 120 start treatment : Limb-Chest-abdomen CAT scan without contrast medium ( refer Section 4 ) . Evaluation base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion [ 20-24 ] cancer marker ( CEA , cancer antigen ( CA ) 19.9 ) Assessment quality life The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System ( ESAS ) use monitor health condition quality life . Assessment quality life perform baseline visit Day 30 , Day 60 Day 120 start treatment .</detailed_description>
