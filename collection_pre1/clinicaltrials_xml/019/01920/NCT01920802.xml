	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot randomize clinical trial begin delineate pathophysiological change associate antipsychotic associate metabolic side effect . The study perform 36 healthy people age 18 30 , never take antipsychotic , undergo baseline laboratory test randomize 5mg BID olanzapine 6mg BID iloperidone placebo take 4 week . The primary outcome measure correlation early change leptin weight gain . We also record change food intake , rest metabolic rate , oral glucose tolerance fast insulin glucose level , lipid inflammation marker . Subjects follow closely monitor safety throughout 4-week study discontinue medically significant change metabolic status antipsychotic side effect . Metabolic assessment perform time discontinuation end 4-week period , change baseline two treatment group compare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study hypothesis : 1 . Early change ( baseline v day 3 ) leptin correlate later change weight ( study termination . ) 1 . Olanzapine cause great increase calorie consumption baseline multi-item meal compare iloperidone placebo . 2 . Olanzapine subject report great frequency/quantity eat food diary , report increase preference calorically dense food ( ie , high fat content ) compare iloperidone placebo . 3 . Early marker endocrine change cause olanzapine great cause iloperidone placebo , early change correlate weight gain . 2 . Olanzapine great effect glucose homeostasis iloperidone placebo , effect separate effect body weight composition . 1 . Early sign metabolic disturbance , include glucose intolerance ( great excursion OGTT ) insulin resistance ( high plasma insulin ) precede significant weight gain . 2 . Early evidence glucose intolerance and/or insulin resistance predict great metabolic derangement dose olanzapine , evidence exacerbate glucose intolerance OGTT high plasma glucose/insulin level . These effect may necessarily parallel weight gain . 3 . Olanzapine associate great marker inflammation iloperidone placebo .</detailed_description>
