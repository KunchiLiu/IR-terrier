	<brief_summary>Over 5 million Americans Alzheimer 's disease relate dementia , progressive irreversible neurodegenerative condition , affect also close 15 million family caregiver ( CG ) . Sleep efficiency AD patient severely impaired complicate frequent night awakening nocturnal restlessness . Untreated sleep disruption AD patient associate increased rate neuropsychiatric symptom , daytime napping , 'sundowning ' behavior , cognitive functional decline , morbidity mortality . The added strain sleep disruption primary reason family caregiver make decision institutionalize AD patient . The circadian abnormality sleep-wake cycle commonly observe AD patient occur often individual hypothalamic/ pituitary/adrenal ( HPA ) axis hyperactivity . HPA axis hyperactivity may influence diurnal sleep-wake activity diminish AD patient 's ability respond external zeitgebers , turn , propagate HPA axis dysfunction . Thus , intervention normalize diurnal HPA axis pattern may beneficial treat sleep-wake disturbance . Nonpharmacologic treatment first line therapy AD patient sleep wake problem , give ineffective potentially harmful effect pharmacologic agent . Current clinical sleep hygiene practice institutional ( e.g. , nursing home ) settings hold promise reduce disruptive sleep reestablish circadian pattern HPA functioning . These intervention include use time planned activity daylight hour create relax environment evening . However little systematic work do determine efficacy intervention home setting ( individual AD reside ) . We propose pilot study ( ) characterize objective sleep parameter behavioral symptom sleep-wake disturbance , biological indicator diurnal HPA axis activity sample community reside old adult AD : ( b ) examine effect time planned activity subjective objective characteristic sleep , behavioral symptom , HPA status ; ( c ) evaluate measurement approach home-dwelling AD patient . Subjective ( CG questionnaire ) objective ( wrist actigraphy ) characteristic sleep behavioral symptom measure fifty-four AD patient care home family . Patients CG randomize receive intervention time , planned activity ( TPA ) attention control ( AC ) condition . We also obtain diurnal measure HPA activity include salivary cortisol alpha amylase .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The inclusion/exclusion criterion design obtain sample moderate stage AD patient sleep disruption seek ass occur frequently stage . AD patient must : 1 ) diagnosis probable AD ( physician generate ) ; 2 ) age 60 ; 3 ) able provide saliva sample ; 4 ) able tolerate wrist actigraphy per caregiver report . Family caregiver must : 1 ) English speaking ; 2 ) provide care minimum 3 month ; 3 ) primary caregiver ( selfidentifies provide daytoday care ) . To minimize contribution extraneous variable , subject exclude follow : regular use medication substantial known effect measurement alpha amylase cortisol ( e.g . corticosteroid , interferon , betablockers , cytotoxic chemotherapy ) ; major surgery past 3 month ; history major psychiatric and/or personality disorder ; history heavy cigarette smoking ( e.g . &gt; 50 pack year ) ; loss love one past 3 month . Conditions know affect measurement sleep also exclude : use sedatives/ hypnotic , Huntington 's ' disease , normal pressure hydrocephalus , Parkinson 's disease , advanced heart failure ( New York Heart Stage 34 ) , morbid obesity ( BMI &gt; 35 ) , indication restless legs syndrome periodic limb movement disorder . We exclude subject screen positive sleep apnea ( actigraph/pulse oximetry oxygen desaturation index &gt; 15 ) .</criteria>
