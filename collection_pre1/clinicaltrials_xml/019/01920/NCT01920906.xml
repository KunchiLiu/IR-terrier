	<detailed_description>Psoriasis common chronic skin disorder estimate prevalence population approximately 2 % . Psoriatic skin lesion start initial pinhead-sized macule coalesce plaque vary sizes diameter one several centimeter . Despite great stride study psoriasis , still unclear psoriatic skin lesion start small macule spread peripherally . The occurrence psoriasis think pathological consequence exaggerate immune response activate T cell , monocyte , neutrophil , dendritic cell produce inflammatory cytokine drive additional recruitment inflammatory cell , elaboration proinflammatory mediator , proliferation keratinocytes . However , pathogenetic mechanism peripheral spread psoriasis need elucidate . To study peripheral spread psoriasis , investigator plan study `` small plaque psoriasis '' compare `` large plaque psoriasis '' Korean population . Psoriasis vulgaris , so-called `` large plaque psoriasis '' , common form psoriasis , see approximately 90 % psoriasis patient . Red , scaly , symmetrically distribute plaque usually large 5 cm diameter characteristically localize extensor aspect extremity , particularly elbow knee , along scalp , low lumbosacral , buttock , genital involvement . Approximately 1/4 1/3 large plaque psoriasis participant involvement 5 % body surface area ( BSA ) , disease extent frequently painful physically and/or socially debilitate degree comparable chronic medical condition . On hand , `` small plaque psoriasis '' common typical form psoriasis occur adult particularly Korea Asian country . Korean small plaque psoriasis , even chronic , remain &lt; 2 cm size widely distribute upper trunk proximal extremity . Small plaque psoriasis less severe large plaque psoriasis , usually respond phototherapy potent therapy rarely need . It also noteworthy well-known human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) difference Caucasians comparison Asian participant psoriasis , unique HLA haplotype describe Korean participant psoriasis . Furthermore , allele HLA-related gene , know major histocompatibility complex I chain-related gene A , know susceptibility marker Korean Chinese participant psoriasis , Spanish participant . For comprehensive analysis difference small large plaque psoriasis , investigator plan compare two different type psoriasis Korean population . The study genetically homogeneous cohort , characterize relatively high prevalence small plaque psoriasis Korean population , may filter spurious signal allow significant association emerge relatively low number participant . By compare Korean psoriasis participant two geographically separated location ( Seoul , Korea vs. New York , NY , USA ) , also interest understand interaction genetics environment still well define . It anticipate study could lead new understanding mechanism involve spread psoriatic plaque provide new insight psoriasis pathogenesis .</detailed_description>
