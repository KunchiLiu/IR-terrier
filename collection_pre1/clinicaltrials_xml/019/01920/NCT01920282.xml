	<brief_summary>Numerous anti-hypertensive drug report efficacious reduce central arterial stiffness effect may contribute improve outcomes hypertensive patient . However , result several study suggest beta-blockers may actually increase arterial stiffness . In contrast , limited evidence suggest nebivolol , third generation beta-blocker augments release vascular nitric oxide , reduce central arterial stiffness hypertensive individual . Unfortunately , study address issue study rely indirect , blood pressure dependent measure arterial stiffness . In addition , none study focus middle-aged older , obese hypertensive , population accelerate arterial stiffening risk cardiovascular disease . Thus , potential utility nebivolol therapy reduce large artery stiffness , particularly among latter population , remain unclear .</brief_summary>
