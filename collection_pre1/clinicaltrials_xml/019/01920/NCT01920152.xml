	<brief_title>Platelet Rich Plasma v Hyaluronic-Acid Hip OA ( Osteoarthritis )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common , painful condition affect adult cause mobility disability United States Europe . Unfortunately , agent available halt OA progression . Analgesics nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) suboptimal effectiveness , concern systemic side effect . A large challenge development appropriate effective therapy patient OA . Currently , suitable route administer OA therapy appear intra-articular injection allow accumulation critical dos drug within damage area also reduce risk systemic side effect . The primary objective study compare clinical efficacy intra-articular injection Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) vs. Hyaluronic Acid symptomatic early OA hip . Secondarily , study aim evaluate safety feasibility medication deliver . Patients , meet inclusion criterion , confirm eligible , agree enroll study , would randomize treat either three intra-articular PRP injection three intra-articular Hyaluronic Acid injection . If patient OA hip , randomize receive injection hip . The Primary investigator unblinded treatment subject randomize . The PI involve initial assessment patient actual injection . All follow visit , clinical assessment outcome score perform sub-investigator , also examine physician . The sub-investigator blind treatment throughout study . All study subject blind treatment assign . Physical exam perform assess range motion hip joint . The difference range motion statistically compare different time point two group determine difference improvement two compare baseline . The primary efficacy outcome define percentage patient 50 % decrease sum score WOMAC pain subscale baseline week 24 . We measure outcome applying WOMAC questionnaire compare baseline therapy . The secondary efficacy outcome also include IHOT Non Arthritic Hip Score . An anterior posterior hip radiograph perform 12 month 24 month ass Kellgren-Classification compare baseline .</detailed_description>
