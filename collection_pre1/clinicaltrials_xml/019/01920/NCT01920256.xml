	<brief_summary>Patients type 2 diabetes attain superior disease outcomes multiple therapy goal simultaneously achieve maintain . In reality , therapy goal seldom achieve , patient become susceptible devastating complication great health care expense . Studies show regular monitoring therapy adjustment prerequisite achieve maintain therapy goal . Unfortunately implementation regular monitoring therapy adjustment hinder high clinic workload shortage endocrinologist . Due shortage , endocrine care accessible le 20 % patient type 2 diabetes . The overwhelming majority manage provider may lack necessary expertise time deliver optimal disease management , particularly insulin prescribed . Objectives : We hypothesize type 2 diabetes endocrine clinic high-risk patient complement primary care , personalize frequency remote disease intervention employ infrequent face-to-face outpatient visit , achieve comparable clinical outcome patient satisfaction compare usual endocrine clinic care , reduce workload increase clinic capacity . The intervention clinic employ regular remote communication initiated endocrinologist , base tailor individual plan . Frequent remote monitoring intervention reinforce attainment therapy goal allow decrease frequency outpatient visit . In turn , clinic workload decrease able accommodate patient type 2 diabetes traditional endocrine clinic . The aim study test new endocrine clinic model clinical trial monitor clinical parameter , patient satisfaction clinical workload . The long-term objective modify current model endocrine care patient type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Emerging data suggest clinical intervention may implement successfully variety remote communication . Thus far regular monitoring treatment adjustment remote communication yet fully integrated endocrine practice scalable fashion readily disseminate . The PI propose test new endocrine model care clinic high-risk patient type 2 diabetes employ regular communication initiate provider , base tailor individual plan . Frequent monitoring intervention reinforce attainment prespecified therapy goal , enhance patient engagement , allow significant decrease frequency outpatient visit . In turn , clinic able accommodate patient type 2 diabetes traditional endocrine clinic . Data management day-to-day clinic operation computerize technology developed institution . The project highly significant since propose new model endocrine care high-risk patient type 2 diabetes may improve disease outcome patient reduce medical expense .</detailed_description>
