	<brief_summary>Physical activity powerful lifestyle factor average reduces risk development diabetes cardiovascular disease . Nevertheless , investigator demonstrate follow supervised endurance exercise training , 20 % subject show change fitness 30 % demonstrate improvement insulin sensitivity . Our concept use molecular profiling blood/muscle sample investigator develop personalised lifestyle intervention tool . Further , reveal biological basis variable metabolic cardiovascular response exercise enable u propose new target biomarkers drug discovery effort directly human . Using establish OMICS approach ( RNA , DNA Metabo- ) investigator generate classifier predict response exercise-therapy ( fitness insulin sensitivity ) . Classifier generation statistical strategy diagnosis prognosis . Critically , investigator large human tissue biobank , include subject insulin-resistance ; young elderly male female , well twin . Our SME partner significant intellectual property capacity field bio-prediction , proven track-record collaboration team product development . Investigators add diversity biobank carrying-out exercise intervention study use novel time-efficient strategy investigator recently proven effective reduce insulin resistance sedentary young people middle age obese subject . A time-efficient protocol critical lack-of-time key reason maintain physical activity level . Finally , investigator novel out-bred rodent model replicate high low exercise training response investigator establish suitability future drug screening purpose . Because substantial pre-existing resource investigator believe project high probability deliver goal improve healthcare European citizen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aerobic exercise capacity , prospective follow-up analysis , strong predictor morbidity mortality recognise risk factor hypertension . Furthermore , powerful lifestyle factor average reduces risk development Type II diabetes arguably increased physical activity . Investigators clearly demonstrate follow many week supervise aerobic exercise training ~20 % sedentary volunteer show almost change gold standard measurement fitness many demonstrate poor response . Furthermore least 25 % people demonstrate improvement insulin sensitivity response aerobic training . Critically , 15 % subject undergo supervised exercise intervention programme ( full compliance ) actually demonstrate decline insulin sensitivity exercise training . Extensive citation provide original grant application document . A major aim project identify genomic molecular predictor lack positive benefit ( 'non-responder ' ) , individualise health care strategies life style change produce fight prevent metabolic diseases obesity , diabetes cardiovascular disease . Identification 'high responder ' physical training form additional positive outcome research program . Understanding biological basis 'highest-responders ' provide enormous insight molecular basis positive exercise adaptation number important health industry related opportunity . For example , knowledge patient high-responder could use encourage cardiacfailure patient remain motivated rehabilitation . Knowledge patient low responder would enable clinician set proper expectation rehabilitation . Finally , part research plan investigator establish utility novel time-efficient lifestyle strategy high potential integrate modern life . Investigators bring together lead EU North American investigator study life-style determinant diabetes , obesity cardiovascular disease . In particular , workpackages focus boost capacity diagnose , develop drug-screening solution enable application personalise medicine field life-style determinant diabetes , obesity cardiovascular disease . Our deliverable include new validated product define high risk population . Investigators achieve identification validation molecular predictor quantify extent health benefit increase physical activity . Optimisation prescription physical activity treatment insulin resistance , contribute long term prevention diabetic complication .</detailed_description>
