Few study conduct preschool child . Obesity stunt childhood increase risk obesity adulthood lead chronic disease . If obesity establish adulthood , difficult reduce excess weight . Thus , prevention obesity stunt young child highly consider . Study dietary pattern reliable field method measure fat mass ( FM ) child may partly contribute primary prevention childhood obesity . The deuterium dilution technique accurate suitable method child population-based study . However , widely use child Thailand . Hence , study aim utilize deuterium dilution technique assess body composition determine quality quantity dietary intake among child 3-5 year age different nutritional status . We conduct cross-sectional study 15 daycare center Nakhon Pathom Samut Prakarn province . 120 preschooler purposively select accord nutritional status : stunt , thin , normal , overweight/obese . Anthropometric measurement conduct . Body composition determine base total body water use deuterium dilution technique . Dietary intake data obtain use 2-day 24 hr recall.We hypothesize stunt obese child fat mass compare normal child .</brief_summary>
