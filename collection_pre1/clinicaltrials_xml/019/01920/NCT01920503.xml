	<brief_summary>Cholangiocarcinoma rare aggressive neoplasm arises biliary epithelium , constitute approximately 2 % report cancer , account 3 % gastrointestinal malignancy . Up date , many modality diagnosis treat range sensitivity specificity , also advantage disadvantage modality . Cholangiocarcinoma poor prognosis . Surgical resection offer curative option usually require major hepatic resection addition resection cholangiocarcinoma . Unfortunately , curative resection possible 30 % patient due locally advanced disease , distant metastasis comorbidity elderly patient . Even resection , recurrence rate approximately 60 % , result low 5-year overall survival ( OS ) . Patients intra-hepatic Cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) limit benefit systemic chemotherapy , indeed , unresectable cholangiocarcinoma Overall Survival systemic chemotherapy less 1 year . Since cholangiocarcinoma patient develop distant metastasis late stage , locoregional therapy interest therapeutic strategy . Locoregional therapy study patient intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma employ radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) external well internal radiation therapy yield promising result last couple year . TACE safe may effective prolong survival patient nonresectable combined hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) -cholangiocarcinoma , compare historically report survival patient . Tumor vascularity highly associated tumor response . The patient survival period TACE combine HCC-cholangiocarcinoma significantly dependent tumor size , tumor vascularity , Child-Pugh class , presence absence portal vein invasion . Currently , center perform TACE therapy unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma . Several European study report efficacy safety TACE ICC . The establishment registry obtain majority Cholangiocarcinoma case treat locoregional approach within outside Europe help investigator evaluate large non-ambiguous sample population . This would help investigator evaluate technical success rate , clinical success rate , feasibility safety TACE ICC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Registry Cholangiocarcinoma Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : Prospective observational study Primary objective : This data collection study main purpose collect information treatment patient receive unresectable cholangiocarcinoma . Secondary objective : To create international Registry include patient undergoing locoregional treatment , correlate tumour characteristic outcome , survival prognosis ; identify criterion guide therapy include TACE , chemoinfusion locoregional treatment Treatment modality TACE Day -1 Doxorubicina 50-75 mg/mq charge onto 2 ml 70-150 µm M1 microspheres Pharmacy . Day -1 : prehydration , antibiotic prophylaxis set therapeutic scheme appropriate analgesic prophylaxis ( 3-day duration ) previously report 1 vial tropisetron ( diluted 100ml physiological solution ) administer slow drip Day 0 : Upon admittance radiology room , patient receive morphine hydrochloride 10 mgr dilute 100 ml salin solution i.v . ( repeated one hour procedure necessary also 6 hour ) . Tropisetron i.v . need . Intra-arterial premedication 2.5 mgr verapamil 2.5 mgr dilute 4 ml normal saline solution follow 4 ml lidocaine 2 % . Selected arterial Infusion ( consider tumor uptake dominant disease ) doxorubicina 50-75 mg preloaded 2 ml 70-150 µm M1 microspheres . Second infusion doxorubicin dose 2 ml 70-150 µm M1 microspheres administer TACE ( oncologist 's planning cure ) . Day +30 : The procedure repeat . Day +90 : In case response , third administration follow procedure repeat Evaluation response Response must assess repeat follow examination Day 30 , Day 90 Day 120 start treatment : Chest-abdomen CAT scan without contrast medium ( refer Section 4 ) . Evaluation base Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) cancer marker ( CEA ) , Cancer Antigen ( CA ) 19.9 ) Assessment quality life The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System ( ESAS ) use monitor health condition quality life . The questionnaire must fill patient unaided family member health care personnel , period 15 minute . Assessment quality life perform baseline visit Day 30 , Day 60 Day 120 start treatment .</detailed_description>
