	<brief_summary>This study test hypothesis GSK1278863 reduce neurologic , renal , and/or cardiac ischemia patient undergo elective descend thoracic aorta/thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm ( DTA/TAAA ) repair , population know high risk ischemic event underlie pathology surgical complexity require address disease . Approximately 160 subject stratify accord intervention type ( surgical endovascular repair , latter limit 50 % total study population ) randomize 1:1 fashion treatment GSK1278863 ( 300 milligram [ load dose ] follow 100 milligram [ mg ] /day x 4 day ) placebo start prior plan repair , postoperative day 3 . The duration participation study expect approximately 4 8 week screen follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Adults &gt; = 18 year age require follow type descend thoracic aorta thoracoabdominal aorta repair atherosclerotic aneurysm chronic dissection ( de novo Type B residual Type B [ follow Type A repair ] ) via open surgery endovascular stenting ( TEVAR ) per treat surgeon Open surgery : Extent I TAAA ( +/distal arch ) extend beyond renal ostia . Extent II TAAA ( +/distal arch ) . Extent III TAAA ( define proximal extent anastamosis superior inferior pulmonary vein ) . Extent IV TAAA prior TEVAR redo procedure ( set `` redo '' prior abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) open endovascular aortic repair ( EVAR ) , either proximal suture line disruption mesenteric segment aneurysm recurrence require redo Extent IV reconstruction ) . DTA repair one following : Safi extent C coverage . Subclavian diaphragm disease extent . &gt; 75 % total DTA length . TEVAR one following : Full DTA coverage previous abdominal EVAR open AAA . Full DTA coverage include Zone 2 celiac ( i.e. , distal arch plus full coverage DTA ) . Full DTA coverage celiac artery coverage without left subclavian artery coverage ( Zone 2 Zone 3 proximal landing ) , full DTA ( either Zone 2 Zone 3 ) extension distal celiac visceral debranching ( e.g. , abdominal hybrid Extent 2 TAAA ) . Note : Zone 2 define leave carotid coverage leave subclavian artery Zone 3 define first 3cm distal leave subclavian ( e.g. , leave subclavian ligamentum [ isthmus ] ) . Completed stag bypass procedure precede aortic repair least 48 hour prior repair . Expect placement lumbar CSF catheter procedure plan maintain least 48 hour per treat physician . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milli international unit /mililiter ( mL ) estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/mL ( &lt; 147 picomoles/Liter ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method screen completion Followup Visit . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method . This criterion must follow time Screening completion Followup Visit . Exclusion Criteria The subject traumatic aortic dissection . The subject baseline NIHSS &gt; 1 modified Rankin Scale &gt; 1 . The subject history myocardial infarction , stroke , spinal infarct within past 3 month . The subject active ulcer disease recent gastrointestinal bleeding within past 6 month . The subject history deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism past 12 month . The subject treat malignancy ( exclude nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) within past 12 month confirm disease free . The subject treatment retinal neovascularization ( e.g. , diabetic proliferative retinopathy age relate macular degeneration ) within 3 month randomization . The subject currently receive dialysis . The subject currently receive expect require treatment ( within study period ) erythropoiesis medication epoetin alfa ( Procrit , Epogen ) , darbepoetin alfa ( Aranesp ) . The subject follow screening : Hemoglobin &gt; 15.5 gram ( g ) /decilitre ( dL ) ( male subject postmenopausal female ) Hemoglobin &gt; 14.5 g/dL ( premenopausal female subject ) Single QTc &gt; =480 millisecond ( msec ) ; QTc &gt; =500 msec subject bundle branch block ( criterion apply subject predominately pace rhythm ) Aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase &gt; =2xupper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &gt; =1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; =1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen Lactation pregnancy ( determine positive serum urine hCG test ) The use prohibit medication History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 g alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer , 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) 80 proof distil spirit . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) .</criteria>
