	<brief_title>Study Endorectal Cooling During RARP Minimize Trauma Promote Earlier Return Continence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study ass use endorectal cooling device , UroCool , achieve control , local hypothermia pelvis . The study evaluate safety effectiveness device induce hypothermia neuromuscular tissue impact continence RARP . The UroCool system design apply targeted temperature control pelvic anatomy RARP . The pelvis cool transrectally via closed cycle recirculation chill sterile saline use single-use disposable balloon catheter connect via circulation IV set control console cover current 510 ( k ) commercially available . The UroCool polymeric catheter design insert within rectal cavity adjacent prostate prior surgery remove upon completion surgery . It use conjunction InnerCool Console circulate cold saline close loop within UroCool catheter allow therapeutic localized cooling prostate gland surround area prostate surgery .</detailed_description>
