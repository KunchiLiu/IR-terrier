	<brief_summary>This study look use telehealth version self management program individual new onset chronic traumatic spinal cord injury . The program call Health Mechanics . It mean enhance self management skill relate neurogenic bladder bowel management prevent associate problem improve Quality Life ( QOL ) . This program base need strengths individual SCI . It focus enhance skill , encourage positive health behavior , empower people within environment , recognize people differ resource ability . The skill part intervention : attitude , self-monitoring , problem-solving , communication , organization stress management . This study address skill context bladder bowel health , expectation skill useful area life well . The investigator hypothesize individual Health Mechanics intervention group : - show great improvement problem solve skill , healthy attitude disability knowledge SCI management skill control group - great adherence recommend bladder bowel management behavior control group - few bladder bowel complication control group - high level QOL control group In word , study investigate effectiveness telehealth version Health Mechanics enhance self-management skill relate neurogenic bladder bowel management attempt prevent associate complication improve QOL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Bowel Bladder Health Management Program Individuals With Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Overview This study evaluate efficacy newly develop self-management program , Health Mechanics , develop improve bladder bowel management skill among person new chronic SCI . Program participation expect prevent bladder bowel relate medical complication ( e.g. , constipation , leakage ) , lead enhance social participation QOL . Health Mechanics design study PI , Dr. Meade , 2007 2009 fund Paralyzed Veteran 's America Education Foundation assist person SCI develop transfer necessary skill keep body healthy manage many aspect SCI care . This study investigate effectiveness telehealth version Health Mechanics enhance self-management skill relate neurogenic bladder bowel management attempt prevent associate complication improve QOL . The study make unique contribution rehabilitation emphasize concept personal responsibility control one 's health life whole . By select telehealth approach ( defined telephone-based ) program implementation , investigator also attempt address high cost care delivery lack health care access underserved population SCI live remote area State Michigan . The Health Mechanics program design base need strengths individual SCI responsive identify gap challenge health care provision population . The program focus enhance skill , encourage positive health behavior empower people within environment , recognize people different resource ability . For study , Health Mechanics program adapt specifically focus bladder bowel management related concern administer via telephone , thus well address needs rural population transportation-related challenge . By teach skill well manage bladder bowel health , self-management program reduce occurrence complication also result high level social integration QOL . Since skill teach - attitude , self-monitoring , problem-solving , communication , organization stress management - address context performing behavior necessary enhance bladder bowel health , expect generalize area improvement skill result good overall health participation . Purpose Objectives The propose study 's overall purpose evaluate effect Health Mechanics prevent bladder bowel complication improve QOL . The program specifically target newly injure individual early prevention complication , well individual chronic injury later treatment prevention complication . Objectives : 1 ) improve self-management skill , include problem-solving , knowledge health behavior , attitude disability ; 2 ) increase adherence recommend bladder bowel management behavior ; 3 ) improve bladder bowel health related QOL ; 4 ) determine extent program improvement term skill acquire sustained time . Short-term refers 3 6 month assessment long-term refers 12 month assessment . All hypothesis posit , follow intervention , difference exist participant Health Mechanics program perform well control group ( assessment group difference ) difference sustain time ( assessment within group difference ) . It expect individual new injury improve time regardless group assignment , individual chronic injury stabilize prior admission study . Because naturally occur difference trajectory , examine within group difference . Research Hypotheses H1 : Program participant show great improvement problem solve skill , healthy attitude disability knowledge SCI management skill control group ; improvement sustain time within group . H2 : Program participant great adherence recommend bladder bowel management behavior control group ; improvement sustain time within group . H3 : Program participant few bladder bowel complication member control group ; difference maintain time within group . H4 : Program participant high level QOL control group ; difference sustain time within group .</detailed_description>
