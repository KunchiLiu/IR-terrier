	<detailed_description>Introduction : Angiogenesis , growth proliferation new blood vessel , important aspect vascular proliferation find tumor growth , wound repair , inflammatory state , ischemic sequel ocular angiogenetic disease . Intraocular neovascularization , major eventually complication diabetic mellitus , may result vitreous hemorrhage , tractional retinal detachment , neovascularization glaucoma eventually blindness . The involved factor include basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) , vascular endothelial cell growth factor ( VEGF ) , Connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) /Cysteine-rich protein ( Cyr61 ) /Nephroblastoma overexpressed gene ( CCN ) family . VEGF primary angiogenic factor mediate ischemic-induced retinal neovascularization . VEGF level elevate vitreous fluid patient proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) . The unselective anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab use treatment diabetic retinopathy . Problem : In spite potent anti-VEGF property , completely inhibit ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization . Several factor detect increase vitreous level PDR patient might participate angiogenic process diabetic retinopathy . One member CCN family , connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) , find involve angiogenesis fibrosis mechanism PDR . It unclear factor CCN family might also control development retinal angiogenesis fibrosis.We measure vitreous cysteine-rich 61 ( Cyr61 ) level PDR patient , non-diabetic patient , PDR patient pretreated bevacizumab . We correlate cysteine-rich 61 level different stage PDR . Concomitant VEGF level also measure good understand interaction different factor .</detailed_description>
