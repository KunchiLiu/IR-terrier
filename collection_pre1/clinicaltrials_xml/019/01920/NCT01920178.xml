	<detailed_description>This protocol design demonstrate PinPointe FootLaser treatment able produce clinical improvement treat onychomycosis patient previously take Terbinafine fail treatment . The duration enrollment subject 2 year , expectation time period yield 100 % reduction area involve nail . Enrollment competitive expect enroll 40 patient CHA . The medical device subject clinical trial PinPointe FootLaser , manufacture NuvoLase , Inc . It pulse Nd : Yag laser device use proprietary pulse train , operate 1064nm wavelength , 100 μsec pulse . It receive pre-market Section 510 ( k ) clearance FDA subsequent clearance treatment onychomycosis 2010 . Onychomycosis ( OM ) , fungal infection toe , major health problem around world . It estimate 40 million sufferer condition USA . A recent European study show prevalence onychomycosis may high 26.9 % . Importantly , particular problem disproportionately affect diabetic . The main causative agent varies accord climate . Dermatophyte infection common worldwide . Preliminary vitro vivo work demonstrate proof principle PinPointe FootLaser device kill microorganism , include dermatophytes fungi , infect toenail . Based preliminary result , study design demonstrate efficacy safety PinPointe FootLaser clearing toenail , include onychomycosis .</detailed_description>
