	<brief_summary>This study 's goal determine frequency severity acute graft versus host disease , evaluate incidence primary secondary graft rejection , assess event free survival overall survival , determine time neutrophil platelet engraftment , determine time immune reconstitution ( include normalization T , B natural killer ( NK ) cell repertoire Immunoglobulin G production ) , establish incidence infectious complication include bacterial , viral , fungal atypical mycobacterial infection follow CD34+ selection child , adolescent young adult receive allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant family member unrelated adult donor non-malignant disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CD34+ Stem Cell Selection Patients Receiving Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Non-Malignant Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) condition result reaction transplant donor T-lymphocytes body organs patient receive transplanted cell . There two form : acute ( early ) chronic ( late ) . Acute GVHD may produce skin rash , liver disease , diarrhea , increase risk infection . Chronic GVHD appear patient without prior acute GVHD . Chronic GVHD may also produce skin rash , liver disease , diarrhea increase risk infection . GVHD make patient sick , GVHD make likely patient survive transplant . In study investigator offer treat donor peripheral blood stem cell hope make less likely patient receive GVHD . Patients study offer experimental treatment involve use Miltenyi CliniMacs CD34+ selection device remove T-cells peripheral blood stem cell transplant order decrease risk acute chronic GVHD . CD34+ stem cell select donor 's peripheral blood stem cell . In , T-cells also remove . T-cells cell responsible graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . This study clinical trial patient diagnose non-malignant disease receive peripheral blood stem cell transplant . Patients follow type non-malignant disease participate study : Bone marrow failure syndrome ( include Severe Aplastic Anemia , Severe Congenital Neutropenia , Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia ( Kostman 's Syndrome ) , Diamond-Blackfan Anemia , Schwachman Diamond Syndrome , Primary Immunodeficiency Syndromes , Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndromes , Histiocytic Disorders ) Hemoglobinopathies ( include Sickle Cell Anemia Sickle/Beta Thalassemia ) . Patients study give standard transplant therapy either high dos chemotherapy drug low dos chemotherapy drug , depend disease . Diseases within disease group receive chemotherapy standard condition . Some patient study receive allogeneic stem cell transplant ( AlloSCT ) match related donor . If patient match related donor , bone marrow search do bone marrow bank world . The patient go receive AlloSCT either partially match family member unrelated adult stem cell transplant donor . The transplanted cell allow normal part patient 's blood system recover . The experimental portion treatment involve use Miltenyi CliniMacs CD34+ selection device remove T-cells peripheral blood stem cell transplant order decrease risk acute chronic GVHD . CD34+ stem cell selection AlloSCT study adult malignant non-malignant disease successful engraftment show improvement GVHD . It unknown CD34+ stem cell selection work prevent severe GVHD child adolescent .</detailed_description>
