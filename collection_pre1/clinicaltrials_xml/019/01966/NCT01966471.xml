	<brief_summary>This two-arm , randomize , open-label , multicenter study evaluate efficacy safety trastuzumab emtansine combination pertuzumab versus trastuzumab combination pertuzumab taxane adjuvant therapy participant human epidermal growth ( HER ) factor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive primary invasive breast cancer . Following surgery anthracycline-based chemotherapy , participant receive either trastuzumab emtansine dose 3.6 milligram per kilogram ( mg/kg ) pertuzumab dose 420 milligram ( mg ) intravenously ( IV ) every 3 week ( q3w ) trastuzumab dose 6 mg/kg pertuzumab dose 420 mg IV q3w combination taxane .</brief_summary>
