	<brief_summary>Nasogastric decompression routinely use major intra-abdominal operation . Nasogastric tube intubation think decrease postoperative ileus ( nausea , vomit , gastric distension ) . Wound respiratory complication , reduce incidence anastomotic leak gastrointestinal surgery . However , necessity nasogastric decompression follow elective abdominal surgery increasingly question last several year . Many clinical study suggest practice provide benefit could increase patient discomfort respiratory complication . Furthermore , meta-analyses conclude routine nasogastric decompression longer warrant elective abdominal surgery . Elective abdominal surgery without nasogastric decompression initially test widely use patient colorectal surgery . However , upper gastrointestinal operation gastrectomy , nasogastric consider necessary prevent consequence postoperative ileus ( anastomotic leakage leak duodenal stump . Therefore , study gastrectomy without nasogastric tube emerge later colectomy . In spite study report need nasogastric tube abdominal operation , paper report pancreaticoduodenectomy . Postulated cause lack study assess need nasogastric tube pancreaticoduodenectomy include anticipate prolonged postoperative paralytic ileus cause PD-related extensive destruction potential risk gastric stasis PD . However , pilot study retrospective analysis postoperative NG drainage amount 100 patient recently PD hospital show 90 % patient le 200cc/day NG drainage amount first three day operation . Theoretically , patient need nasogastric tube pancreaticoduodenectomy . Therefore , propose prospective multicenter randomize trial ass need nasogastric tube PD .

	<detailed_description>The study start approval Ethics Committee National Taiwan University Hospital consent sheet obtain include patient . Patients plan PD national Taiwan University Hospital include study obtain consent sheet . Patients emergency surgery , history abdominal irradiation operation exclude study . PD perform describe , include feed gastrostomy tube . The type surgery ( pylorus preserve standard PD ) type management pancreatic stump ( pancreaticojejunostomy pancreaticogastrostomy ) leave surgeon ' discretion . Included patient randomize tube group non-tube control group . Patients tube group 14- 16â€”French nasogastric tube insert operation . For patient tube non-tube group , enteral feeding routinely start within 24 h operation consist 480 mL ( 20 mL/h continuously ) commercially available enteral nutrition solution , calorie-to-milliliter ratio 1:1 glucose-to-lipid ratio 70:30 . The rate delivery progressively increase 10 mL/day goal full nutrition ( 25 kcal/kg ) reach . Enteral nutrition reduce subsequently stop patient able eat sufficient amount food . ( least 1,500 kcal/day ) without vomit . In patient , feed rate reduce stopped result significant abdominal symptom advancement full enteral support via jejunostomy tube first postoperative day . At time , many begin oral diet therefore jejunostomy feeding increase even stop . Patients could resume oral intake encourage daily maintain increase enteral feed level nutrition goal . For patient non-tube group , first flatus passage , patient allow drink 300-500 mL liquid , afterwards soft diet give 2 day . If well tolerate , increase amount solid food give . The NGT reinserted patient later vomit volume 300 mL one occasion . Reinserted tube remove reflux less 200 mL per 24 h , oral feeding ( initially liquid diet ) try . For patient tube group , nasogastric tube remove simultaneously endotracheal tube remove . After first flatus passage , patient allow drink 300-500 mL liquid , afterwards soft diet give 2 day . If well tolerate , increase amount solid food give . The NGT reinserted patient later vomit volume 300 mL one occasion . Reinserted tube remove reflux less 200 mL per 24 h , oral feeding ( initially liquid diet ) try . Members surgical staff , involve trial , record postoperative complication . The postoperative course patient closely monitor . The day passage flatus oral food intake , duration nasogastric tube nasojejunal decompression , length hospital stay record . Mortality , abdominal complication , pulmonary complication ( pneumonia , atelectasis ) , postoperative fever , nausea , vomit , tube insertion reinsertion , discomfort tube ( ear pain , nasal soreness , painful swallow ) note . According recommendation International Study Group Pancreatic Surgery ( ISGPS ) , gastroparesis define need NGT &gt; 3 day need reinsert NGT persistent vomit surgery . The severity gastroparesis classify ISGPS definition grade A : NGT require 4-7 day reinsertion postoperative day ( POD ) 3 inability tolerate solid oral intake POD 7 ; grade B : NGT require 8-14 day inability tolerate solid oral intake POD 14 ; grade C : NGT require &gt; 14 day inability tolerate solid food POD 21 . Again , accord International Study Group definition , postoperative pancreatic fistula define output via operatively place drain ( subsequently place percutaneous drain ) measurable volume drain fluid POD 3 , amylase content great three time upper normal serum value . Postoperative bleeding also grade use ISGPS definition . All infectious complication proven microbiological analysis positive fluid . To compare control modify group , surgical complication classify severity use novel grade system propose Dindo et al . In brief , grade I II complication include minor deterioration normal postoperative course treat drug , blood transfusion , physiotherapy , nutritional supply . Grade III complication require interventional treatment . Grade IV complication life-threatening require intensive care unit management . Death grade V complication . Grade I II complication classify minor grade III , IV , V classify major . The primary objective comparison difference postoperative course determine continuous variable ( time first passage flatus , first oral intake , duration postoperative perfusion , hospital stay operation ) .</detailed_description>
