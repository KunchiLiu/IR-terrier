	<brief_summary>This study explore maternal plasma circulate cell free DNA ( ccfDNA ) use primary screening test Down syndrome part routine clinical care general pregnancy population . Plasma ccfDNA test currently recommend use secondary screen 'high-risk ' woman ( i.e. , woman whose risk factor trisomy make candidate invasive test chorionic villous sample amniocentesis ) . Because woman 'high-risk ' category carry unaffected fetus , many 'unnecessary ' procedure complete order identify woman whose fetus chromosomal disorder . This create expense , anxiety , importantly , loss unaffected fetus due procedure relate miscarriage . Plasma DNA test use reduce significantly number woman unaffected fetus undergo invasive testing . Applying test 'first-line ' screen well-explored , despite call several clinical professional society . The investigator intent introduce , carefully monitor condition , ccfDNA test Rhode Island primary prenatal practice general pregnancy population . Education/orientation prenatal care provider , staff , patient carefully orchestrate , implementation issue identify addressed . Telephone survey consent patient elicit response understand test , satisfaction process , comparison experience serum screen prior pregnancy . Knowledge gain study help validate new screen paradigm involve ccfDNA test . The study design estimate Down syndrome detection rate confidence , provide information uptake rate , failure rate , screen positive rate , decision-making woman positive test result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Maternal plasma ccfDNA test examines fragment maternal fetal ( placental ) DNA normally find mother 's circulation . For targeted chromosome ( e.g. , chromosome 21 ) excess fragment chromosome strongly suggest trisomy fetus ( e.g. , trisomy 21 Down syndrome ) . This technology available since late 2011 mainly offer 'high-risk setting motivate patient , intensive education genetic counselor maternal-fetal medicine professional , low patient volume . As secondary screen test high-risk woman , test reduce frequency invasive procedure 90 % compare conventional serum screening . Since CVS amniocentesis associate procedure-related fetal loss ( important factor among woman refuse procedure ) , use ccfDNA testing may result increase prenatal identification affect fetus high-risk population . However , technology study general risk group woman usually know risk factor present prenatal care . The investigator ' aim observe prenatal practice Rhode Island able offer technology place conventional serum/ultrasound screen early 10 week pregnancy . The investigator expect clinician office staff challenge paradigm shift , patient . The investigator intend develop education program office introduce new test - DNAFirst- methodically Women &amp; Infants Hospital catchment area . The test uptake rate , reaction availability , response screen positive result monitor , along measure relevant implementation test performance . The investigator also survey telephone 100 woman agree DNAFirst test contact determine understand satisfaction new test . Many factor may complicate introduction need address . For example , screen positive result DNAFirst test associate much high risk aneuploidy ( e.g. , 1:2 ) conventional serum screening . The DNAFirst test also associate high rate test failure serum screening . The DNAFirst test protocol include test buccal sample father baby available . It important gauge office patient perceive accept change . Secondary screen high-risk woman use ccfDNA become commonplace often cover insurer . With expected price reduction due improvement sequence technology , likely 12-18 month , insurance coverage ccfDNA test become routine . In set expected test uptake patient decision-making would influence limited insurance currently available . The investigator want simulate patient 's cost ccfDNA test similar currently encounter serum screen . Towards end , Natera , Inc. , Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act certify laboratory San Carlos , California , agree underwrite cost ccfDNA test study period . By identify factor influence patient acceptance understanding patient provider view new paradigm compare establish serum sonographic screening , project provide unbiased evidence regard implementation ccfDNA test general pregnancy population could translate nationwide practice .</detailed_description>
