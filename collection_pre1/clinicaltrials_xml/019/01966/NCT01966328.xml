	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Assessment Resolvine Treatment Vitreomacular Attachment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study effect Resolvine injection patient vitreomacular adhesion . The investigator propose intravitreal injection Resolvine® 36 % : 1 ) Result release vitreous adhesion macula subject symptomatic vitreomacular attachment ( VMA ) . 2 ) The Release VMA create measurable favorable retinal change . 3 ) The release vitreomacular traction may also result visual acuity improvement within short time frame study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Male female subject , 18 year age old 2 . Willing able return study visit 3 . Willing able provide write informed consent 4 . Have symptomatic VMA . 5 . If eye find Anatomic VMA eye lower visual acuity declare study eye . 1 . Subjects high myopia study eye ( axial length great equal 26.0 millimeter ultrasound spherical equivalent spectacle plane great 8.0 diopter ) 2 . Subjects monocular vision contralateral vision 20/400 bad BCVA nonstudy eye 3 . Subjects history retinal detachment tear study eye 4 . Subjects PVD study eye Baseline ( Grade III great PVD Bscan ) 5 . Subjects unstable IOP ( i.e . &gt; 30 mmHg past six month ) IOP &gt; 21 mm Hg enrollment , medical control . Subjects may topical medication control IOP may stop start prostaglandin type epinephrine base drug study . 6 . Subjects aphakic study eye pseudophakic , cataract extraction surgery le 6 month prior study enrollment 7 . Subjects history ocular trauma type study eye 8 . Subjects medium opacity abnormality would preclude observation retina study eye per investigator 's judgment 9 . Subjects undergone previous vitrectomy ( either anterior par plana vitrectomy ) study eye 10 . Subjects history cataract surgery complication study eye 11 . Subjects undergone previous photocoagulation retina study eye 12 . Subjects evidence history either nonproliferative proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR ) ( PDR ) study eye 13 . Subjects anticipate need cataract extraction study eye within next 6 month 14 . Subjects congenital eye malformation 15 . Subjects recurrent uveitis history uveitis either eye 16 . Subjects ongoing ocular infection inflammation study eye 17 . Subjects pregnant nursing . Subjects child bearing age undergo pregnancy test . 18 . Subjects currently participate investigational research study 19 . Subjects ill likely complete entire study 20 . Subjects undergone major surgery within last 6 month ( systemic ocular ) likely require major surgery upcoming 6 month 21 . Subjects uncontrolled diabetic ( HbA1/C &gt; 10 % ) significant morphological pathology time enrollment 22 . Subjects macular hole Stage 2 great determine OCT , Bscan ultrasound clinical examination 23 . Subjects epiretinal membrane ( ERM ) area attachment determine OCT 24 . Subjects receive intravitreal injection therapy within thirty ( 30 ) day treatment Resolvine® 25 . Subjects receive one Jetrea injection study eye</criteria>
