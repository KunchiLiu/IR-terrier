	<brief_summary>This study NIMH-funded multi-site clinical trial include UCLA coordinate site , Emory University Seattle Children 's Hospital , recruit site , Nathan Kline Institute Data Management Center . The purpose study examine effect investigational drug , AZD7325 , potential treatment high-functioning adult 18 -35 year old Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) . The primary study measure effect brain wave measure non-invasive brain wave recording ( electroencephalograms EEGs ) , assessment side effect , measure attention learning . The study drug , AZD7325 , manufacture Astra Zeneca , initially test medication anxiety disorder 488 subject , pursue marketing due benefit anxiety . AZD7325 find good safety profile tolerate majority subject . AZD7325 similar action currently market anxiety drug benzodiazepine class , lack sedative negative effect attention benzodiazepine . The study drug design target GABA neurotransmitter system believe abnormal population . There 2 study phase . Phase 1 include recruitment 24 healthy volunteer without mental disorder ( 6 per site ) order establish normal EEG reference range . Controls see one study visit include clinical evaluation , physical exam , routine blood test , EEG . Once control recruitment complete , Phase 2 begin . Phase 2 involves recruitment 40 adult ( 10 per site ) 18 - 35 year old diagnosis ASD , normal intelligence , specific EEG pattern compare control value . Screening eligibility perform one visit , include clinical evaluation , test learn intelligence , blood urine test , EEG . Those subject find eligible enrolled 6-week medication study . Subjects ASD enrol randomly assign receive study drug AZD7325 placebo match capsule . Subjects see weekly study physician clincians 7 study visit , include 3 additional EEG recording , final follow-up visit ( 9 total visit include screen last 11 week complete ) . Study physicians adjust dose study medication reduce side effect .</brief_summary>
