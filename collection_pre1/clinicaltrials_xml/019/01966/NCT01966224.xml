	<brief_summary>This continue research study vaccine allergy Japanese Red Cedar . The vaccine call CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine . This research study determine vaccine tolerate previous Phase IA research participant respond vaccine booster dose . CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine investigational , mean approve use United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) available research study like one . The study Phase IB , prospective , three cohort , open label study conduct one cohorts non-atopic subject two cohort subject history allergic rhinitis symptom Japanese red cedar CryJ 2 pollen allergen participate previous Phase IA study ( subject participate previous study ) . The study conduct 1 study center . Subjects enrol trial period 80 day . The objective statistical analysis establish safety explore immunogenicity LAMP-vax vaccine . All statistical analysis conduct data trial exploratory nature . The primary objective Phase IB Study evaluate safety immunological response additional dose CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine deliver intramuscularly ( IM ) subject previously receive 4 dos CryJ2-DNA-LAMP vaccine deliver IM every 2 week previous Phase IA study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A safety assessment JRC sensitive non-sensitive subject Group 1 , 2 3 Phase 1A study assess term current skin test reactivity , re-vaccination safety continue safety . Group 1 : receive 2 mg CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine intramuscular ( IM ) injection . The dose regimen group receive one ( 1 ) booster dose . This group follow 80 day ( +/- 10 ) , assess skin reactivity immune response . Group 2 : receive 2 mg CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine intramuscular ( IM ) injection . The dose regimen group receive one ( 1 ) booster dose . This group follow 80 day ( +/- 10 ) , assess skin reactivity immune response . Group 3 : receive 2 mg CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine intramuscular ( IM ) injection . The dose regimen group receive one ( 1 ) booster dose . This group follow 80 day ( +/- 10 ) , assess skin reactivity immune response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects participate previous Phase I A study demonstrate change positive Japanese Red Cedar pollen/Mountain Cedar Day 0 , negative Day 132 ( assign Group 1 ) experience grade 3 adverse reaction . Subjects participate previous Phase I A study originally test negative remain negative Japanese Red Cedar pollen/Mountain Cedar negative Day 0 Day 132 ( assign Group 2 ) experience grade 3 adverse reaction . *For purpose study , retrospective skin test data ( long perform within 60 day screen ) accept , use positive inclusion criterion Execute write informed consent ( English appropriate Japanese ) participate study . For subject enrol study Groups 2 3 , document allergy Japanese Red Cedar pollen demonstrate positive epicutaneous skin test Japanese Red Cedar pollen , CryJ2 Mountain Cedar antigen ( wheal &gt; 3mm great negative control ) . Although , subject may positive skin test allergen , use qualify participate study . For purpose study , retrospective skin test data ( previous Phase IA study ) accept , use positive inclusion criterion Female subject childbearing potential , define surgically sterile least 2 year postmenopausal , must agree use one follow form contraception duration study : hormonal ( oral , implant , injection ) begin &gt; 30 day prior screen , barrier ( condom , diaphragm spermicide ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , vasectomized partner ( 6 month minimum ) . No clinically significant abnormal finding physical examination , exception HEENT ( head , eye , ear , nose throat ) finding consistent allergic rhinitis , medical history , clinical laboratory result screen , opinion Investigator , would jeopardize safety subject impact validity study result . Subject must willing able comply study requirement . Previous Japanese red cedar allergen immunotherapy [ ( Subcutaneous Immunotherapy ( SCIT ) , oral immunotherapy , SLIT ( Sublingual Immunotherapy ) , recombinant peptide ] except investigational therapy administer Phase IA ( CryJ2DNALAMP ) exclusion criterion . History anaphylaxis require medical intervention . Intolerance severe allergic reaction previous immunotherapy ( SCIT , oral immunotherapy , SLIT , recombinant peptide ) . History asthma require daily medication exception exercise induce asthma . ( History intermittent and/or mild asthma permit ) Subjects receive antiIgE monoclonal antibody , antibody therapeutically . Congenital immune deficiency acquire immune suppression . Causes acquire immune suppression may include , limited , systemic illness malignancy infection , use medication corticosteroid chemotherapeutic agent , radiation therapy . History organ transplant , hematologic malignancy , autoimmune disease , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure . History clinically significant gastrointestinal , renal , hepatic , neurologic , hematologic disease , opinion Principal Investigator , would jeopardize safety subject impact validity study result . Inability unwillingness stop use drug may inhibit ability treat severe allergic adverse event . This include , limit ; beta blocker atenolol ( Tenormin ) , metoprolol ( Lopressor , ToprolXL ) propranolol ( Inderal , Inderal LA ) 48 hour prior visit . All subject must antihistamine therapy 7 day skin test . Female subject try conceive , pregnant , lactate . Positive serum pregnancy test screen positive human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) urine test Visit 1 woman childbearing potential . Positive blood screen human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HbSAg ) , Hepatitis C. Chronic history recurrent sinusitis , urticaria angioedema within last 12 month . History alcohol drug abuse within year prior Screening Visit 1 , current evidence substance dependence abuse . Laboratory Values ( hematology , biochemistry , urine test ) , outside normal range , unless abnormality consider clinically significant investigator . Participation clinical trial receipt nonFDA approve therapy within 30 day prior Screening Visit . Subjects antiLAMP antibody Cutpoint Assay baseline exclude . Subjects participate prior Phase I A study experience grade 3 , severe reaction vaccination .</criteria>
