	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN : This multicenter , open-label Phase 3B study design evaluate safety efficacy BMN 110 Australian patient MPS IVA . Approximately 10 patient Australia confirm diagnosis MPS IVA enrol study . Eligible patient receive weekly infusion BMN 110 2.0 mg/kg BMN 110 becomes commercially available Australia . Screening [ Week -4 ] . After obtain informed consent , information demographic , concomitant medication ( ) use medical history ( include pre-study growth data ) collect ; blood drawn confirm MPS IVA diagnosis enzymatic test ( applicable ) ; , blood urine clinical laboratory test collect . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , routine physical examination include standard neurological examination , vital sign ; cervical spine ( flexion-extension ) image either radiograph , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) CT scan may collect Screening visit . Adverse Events ( AEs ) /Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) also monitor collect . Baseline Visit [ Week 1 , Day -1 ] . Upon confirmation eligibility confirm diagnosis MPS IVA enzymatic test , negative pregnancy test Baseline ( woman childbearing age ) medical history , patient enrol study complete follow assessment : urine KS urine creatinine , vital sign , routine physical examination include standard neurological examination , body weight ( verify dose ) , clinical laboratory assessment , immunogenicity test , ECG , 6MW test , 3MSC test RFT perform AEs/SAEs concomitant medication use collect . In addition , anthropometric parameter ( include height ) measure , pain assessment test ( Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool [ APPT ] , pain tool child , adolescent , adult ) administer ; PedsQL ( QOL questionnaire pediatric patient ) SF-36 ( QOL questionnaire adult patient ) questionnaire also complete visit . Patients abnormal overnight pulse oximetry reading assess sleep apnea , result calculate use Apnea-Hypopnea Index ( AHI ) Baseline , Week 25 , Week 49 ETV . Treatment Visit 1 [ Week 1 , Day 1 ] . Patients receive first dose BMN 110 intravenous ( IV ) infusion . Assessments Day 1 include vital sign , routine physical examination include standard neurological examination , concomitant medication use AEs/SAEs . All assessment perform prior treatment , except AEs/SAEs collect continuously throughout study . Immunogenicity lab test complete event Infusion Associated Reaction . Treatment Visits [ Weeks 2-48 ] . Patients treat weekly BMN 110 48 week . Prior weekly treatment , patient vital sign routine physical examination include standard neurological examination . Concomitant medication AEs/SAEs collect every visit . Body weight determine every 4 week Day -1 visit confirm dose volume . Immunogenicity lab test complete event Infusion Associated Reaction . Efficacy Assessment Visits [ Weeks 25 49 ] . The following data collect week 25 49 : clinical laboratory test , urine KS creatinine level , immunogenicity test , ECG , 6MW test , 3MSC test , RFTs anthropometric measurement . The patient also complete APPT test , PedsQL SF-36 questionnaire ( appropriate ) . Patients abnormal overnight pulse oximetry reading assess sleep apnea . Immunogenicity lab test complete event Infusion Associated Reaction . Additional Safety Assessment Week 49 Visit . In addition efficacy safety assessment list , cervical spine radiograph ( flexion-extension ) MRI CT scan also collect Week 49 visit . Extension Phase [ Required Safety Recommended Efficacy Assessments ] : Treatment Visits Patients treat weekly BMN110 start week 49 , follow completion applicable efficacy assessment , BMN110 become commercially available Australia . Patients vital sign , concomitant medication AEs/SAEs collect every visit . Additional blood sample total IgE drug specific IgE test drawn analyze patient experience severe IAR , experience IAR require cessation infusion , anaphylaxis serious hypersensitivity event . Safety Assessments : Treatment Visits [ Every 4 week ] . Body weight obtain every 4 week Day 1 visit confirm dose volume . Treatment Visits [ Every 24 week ] . In addition assessment perform weekly treatment visit , patient undergo pregnancy test ( appropriate ) . Efficacy Assessments [ Recommended every 24 week start Week 73 ] : Routine physical examination include standard neurological examination , clinical laboratory assessment , urine KS creatinine level , ECG , 6MW test , 3MSC test , RFTs anthropometric measurement . The patient also complete APPT test , PedsQL SF-36 questionnaire ( appropriate ) , cervical spine image sleep apnea test ( applicable ) . Patients abnormal overnight pulse oximetry reading assess sleep apnea . End Study Visit ( EOS ) . The patient monitor AEs SAEs 30 day post drug infusion . During Week 53 EOS Visit , patient evaluate AEs/SAEs vital sign take , routine physical examination include standard neurological examination perform , information concomitant medication use collect . Patient withdrawal : Patients may withdraw voluntarily receive BMN 110 time , case encourage continue undergo study assessment . Data patient utilized characterization natural progression MPS IVA . Patients may also withdraw entirely study participation time . Safety The study period non-serious AEs SAEs report begin informed consent obtain 30 day last study visit 30 day last drug infusion , whichever come first . Starting first Screening Day continue end study Early Termination Visit , AEs/SAEs monitor record , routine physical examination include standard neurological examination conduct patient . During Initial Phase , routine physical examination include standard neurological examination conduct patient . During Extension phase , physical examination include neurologic examination recommend , require . Some patient may experience infusion associate reaction ( IARs ) associate administration study drug , thus require prophylactic antihistamine administer prior study drug infusion . Antipyretic pretreatment may give Investigator 's discretion . The internal Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) monitor safety BMN 110 patient may review severe serious IARs occur patient study approval United States Food Drug Administration European Medicines Agency commercialize BMN 110 receive . Vital sign measure , , immediately follow study drug infusion . Adverse event change concomitant medication Safety assessment perform throughout study . Physical examination include neurological examination perform Screening visit include Week 49 Visit . Radiographs ( flexion-extension ) MRI CT scan cervical spine require Screening Week 49 . Clinical laboratory test , Electrocardiograms ( ECG ) require Screening , Baseline , Weeks 25 49 Visits . Blood sample collect Baseline , Weeks 25 49 TAb NAb test . NAb perform TAb negative . Samples Total IgE collect Baseline store test . For patient experience severe infusion associate reaction ( IAR ) , experience IAR require cessation infusion , anaphylaxis serious hypersensitivity event , shortly cessation infusion , Baseline total IgE sample analyze additional blood sample total IgE drug-specific IgE test drawn run . Immediate test total IgE take shortly cessation study drug infusion . Drug-specific IgE also test , must collect sooner 8 hour post infusion later next schedule infusion follow week due rhGALNS interference detection assay . A sample take day IAR , anaphylactic serious hypersensitivity event would prefer may practical . If sample positive , extra volume serum may use characterize drug-specific IgE assay . As patient may experience hypersensitivity reaction associate administration BMN 110 , patient pretreated appropriate dose antihistamine medication approximately 30 minute 1 hour prior infusion . Antipyretic medication may also give discretion Investigator . On infusion day , vital sign measure minimum : immediately ( less 30 minute ) infusion , every 30 minute first hour infusion , every hour remainder infusion , immediately ( less 30 minute ) infusion . Patients also monitor continuous pulse oximetry infusion least 60 minute infusion complete . AEs/SAEs change concomitant medication record throughout study . AEs/SAEs grade accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) .</detailed_description>
