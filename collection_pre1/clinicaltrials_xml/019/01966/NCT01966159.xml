	<detailed_description>The EVOLVE China clinical trial design assess safety effectiveness SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System treatment subject atherosclerotic lesion ( ) native coronary artery China . The SYNERGY™ Stent System ( Boston Scientific Corporation [ BSC Corporation ] , Natick , Massachusetts , United States ) base well characterized Element™ stent platform utilize bioabsorbable poly ( DL-lactide-co-glycolide ) ( PLGA ) polymer deliver everolimus . While SYNERGY new generation DES , safety effectiveness Element stent platform combination everolimus form PROMUS Element stent establish PLATINUM Clinical Trial Program.The PROMUS Element Plus stent ( control device ) use stent platform PROMUS Element stent modify balloon component Stent Delivery System improve overall system deliverability . In addition , previous version SYNERGY stent , SYNERGY First Human Use stent ( SYNERGY FHU stent ) investigate EVOLVE FHU trial complete primary endpoint demonstrate comparable safety efficacy profile SYNERGY FHU PROMUS Element 1-year follow-up ( 28 ) . SYNERGY approve CE Mark .</detailed_description>
