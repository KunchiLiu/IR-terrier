	<brief_summary>When drug company first develop drug , company show Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) drug safe effective . If FDA conclude drug safe effective , FDA approve drug . The company sell drug , company use `` trade name . '' Only drug company develop `` trade name '' drug allow sell . However , drug company create version `` trade name '' drug , usually happen patent `` trade name '' product run . These drug , often call `` generic drug , '' potentially less expensive patient . In order sell generic drug , drug company must show generic version `` trade name '' drug number way . For example , generally show product intend used treat disease condition , label , product active ingredient `` trade name '' drug . The generic company also show generic product `` bioequivalent '' trade name drug , mean generic product get part body drug work rate trade name drug . How show much drug get part body work , fast , depend type product drug . The primary aim research study aid FDA find method ensure version generic drug inhale ( example , drug use treat asthma ) bioequivalent trade name drug . As part research study , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study ( study measure drug level blood time inhalation ) do use three different version fluticasone propionate ( FP , drug routinely use asthmatic patient ) administer use dry powder inhaler ( DPI , inhalation device delivers drug dry powder ) . The result study help FDA ensure generic product trade name drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Formulation Development The aim pharmaceutical development manufacture three Dry powder Inhalation ( DPI ) formulation contain Fluticasone Propionate Plastiape Monodose DPI device , provide distinct vitro deposition pattern Next Generation Impactor . NGI high performance cascade impactor use characterize aerosol particle particle size . It desirable develop three formulation emit dose ( ED ) , impactor size mass ( ISM ) different mass median aerodynamic diameter ( MMAD ) . Meeting design criterion formulation would help see pharmacokinetic parameter sensitive regional difference drug deposition whilst dose deposit lung different formulation same.The three formulation develop label Fluticasone Propionate Drug formulation 1 3 . Study Procedures schedule The study comprise 5 visit total - screen visit 4 treatment visit . At least 5 day lapse treatment visit . Screening Visit During screen visit , inclusion exclusion criterion review ensure volunteer appropriate study . The informed consent review volunteer member study team volunteer encourage ask question ensure volunteer good understanding study . If volunteer eligible agrees participate , volunteer ask sign inform consent form prior study specific procedure include randomization . After volunteer sign inform consent , volunteer interview demographic data , medical history concomitant medication collect record . A physical examination perform vital sign measurement obtain . A pregnancy test female volunteer obtain . Spirometry test inhalation training perform qualified study clinician/investigator ensure suitability volunteer . Laboratory test include Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) , urinalysis metabolic panel collect via venipuncture process lab . Screening test perform within 14 day treatment visit 1 later 2 day treatment visit 1 . All screening result evaluate study clinician/investigator inclusion/exclusion criterion confirm eligibility volunteer . Inhalation training : Inhalation training perform qualified study clinician screen visit study visit . The training accomplish instruction subsequent inhalation via training device contain empty capsule . The instruction use device correctly similar Foradil Aerolizer DPI product information label . ( http : //www.rxlist.com/foradil-drug/medication-guide.htm ) Treatment Visits 1 , 2 , 3 4 Eligible volunteer ask return treatment visit 1 . A minimum period 5 day lapse subsequent treatment visit . Each treatment visit schedule 28 hour two day . The study conduct University Florida ( UF ) CRC ( Clinical Research Center ) . It outpatient study volunteer ask come back follow day 24 hour blood sample . The volunteer ask stay outpatient room treatment visit . The activity carry treatment visit . At treatment visit , eligibility criterion review confirmed ensure volunteer appropriate study . Changes medical history include concomitant medication document . Vital sign obtain . Inhalation training provide volunteer mention section . An IV catheter insert vein locate forearm region volunteer . The IV catheter use avoid multiple prick collect blood sample . The IV catheter use administration drug . The volunteer inhale 5 time give inhaler treatment visit . Each inhaler use one volunteer ensure volunteer 's safety infectious agent . The schedule summarize procedure perform screen visit single treatment visit . Blood sample collection Blood sample draw insert indwell catheter volunteer 's median cubital vein forearm region . Blood sample take 15 minute prior dose product ( pre-dose sample ) 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 45 , 60 minute , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 24 hour post dose . At time point 9ml blood sample collect first 1ml discard remain 8 ml store vacutainer tube plasma preparation storage .</detailed_description>
