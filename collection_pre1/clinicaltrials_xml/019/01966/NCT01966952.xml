	<brief_summary>Renal sympathetic radioablation disrupts nerve high radiofrequency signal creates localize heat , eliminate signal decrease blood pressure . The main purpose study evaluate blood pressure 12 month radioablation , evaluate short long-term effect renal radioablation extent change urine catecholamine level , vascular stiffness , sympathetic nerve activity link change blood pressure . The study also evaluate effect radioablation renal artery well develop teach session family physicians specialist educate new treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Mechanisms Renal Radioablation ( RSRA ) Uncontrolled Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate efficacy , safety select mechanisms renal sympathetic radioablation . The primary outcome study change BP 12 month post treatment assess daytime average systolic BP 24-hr ABPM . In innovation program , propose evaluate follow aspect renal sympathetic radioablation RSRA Patients Resistant HTN : 1 . Efficacy : Assessment BP lower effect patient true resistant HTN . In contrast study do far , evaluate true BP lower effect RSRA performance 24-hr ABPM prior define time point post procedure . We screen pseudohypertension use direct observed therapy . We employ rigorous protocol include patient truly resistant HTN . Namely , screen major form secondary HTN renal artery stenosis , pheochromocytoma , primary hyperaldosteronism , Cushing 's syndrome exclude patient radioablation . We also address issue white coat phenomenon cause false diagnosis resistant HTN 24-hr ABPM . This innovative approach ensure proper evaluation BP lower potential method , patient secondary form HTN may respond RSRA . In contrast , white coat effect may show gradual improvement BP control time unrelated RSRA . 2 . Safety : Imaging renal artery . Our patient undergo CT angiogram image renal artery prior procedure define time point afterwards . In study report far , image renal artery standardize . In animal ( swine ) subject RSRA use catheter , renal artery show fibrosis 10-25 % total medium underlie adventitia , mild disruption external elastic lamina . Furthermore , case report publish document renal artery stenosis within 3 month post RSRA . 3 . Education diagnosis treatment resistant HTN . As resistant HTN frequently misdiagnosed consequently poorly treat , develop teach session family physician , general internist , subspecialists LHIN region make aware issue relate diagnosis true resistant HTN educate new option treatment . 4 . Mechanism : Effects RSRA Central Sympathetic Outflow , PWV , aldosterone assess pre post RSRA correlate ( change ) BP prior define time point post RSRA . Clinical relevance : This new method treatment patient resistant HTN . As team successfully treat two patient resistant HTN June 2012 ( second team centre Canada ) , TOH/UOHI expert Clinical HTN , Nephrology , Interventional Cardiology Interventional Radiology uniquely position establish critically evaluate suitability method patient LHIN region . Pilot data Pulse Wave Velocity , MSNA aldosterone RSRA shed light mechanism involve BP lower RSRA use development grant application Canadian peer review funding agency .</detailed_description>
