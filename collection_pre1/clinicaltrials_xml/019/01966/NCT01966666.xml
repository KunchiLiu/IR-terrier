	<brief_title>A Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics Preliminary Efficacy Study TPI-287 Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The maximum tolerated dose TPI-287 determine plan dose escalation 3 sequential cohort , comprise 11 participant randomize either TPI-287 placebo . TPI-287 placebo administer intravenous infusion every 3 week 9 week , total 4 infusion . Participants successfully complete phase option enter open label extension phase TPI-287 administer every 3 week additional 6 week , total 3 extra infusion . Pre-medication diphenhyramine 25 mg ( Benadryl ) give IV within 30 60 minute prior study infusion study . Safety tolerability assess report adverse event , physical neurological testing , ECGs , well blood urine analysis . Baseline end-point measure cognition function , MRI brain scan , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarker analysis use determine preliminary efficacy TPI-287 mild-moderate AD . Pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic property TPI-287 calculate blood plasma collect first infusion , CSF collect last visit placebo-controlled phase .</detailed_description>
