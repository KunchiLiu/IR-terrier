	<brief_summary>Child food allergy represent 6 8 % child industrialised country . Within allergy , peanut egg allergy one common . Actually suspicion food allergy , OPT gold standard diagnosis . During OPT give increase dos allergen patient evaluate threshold cause clinical reaction . This test associate risk strong allergic reaction need medical supervision . Standard allergy test , like skin test specific IgE test , ca n't use diagnosis allergy . Some publication demonstrate test lack sensibility specificity child food allergy diagnosis . New test develop diagnosis child food allergy without risk . The BAT cellular test able evaluate basophile activation specific allergen vitro . This test allow u evaluate physiologically sensitization patient allergen . It already use drug allergy evaluate infant milk allergy clinical trial . In study want evaluate sensitivity BAT diagnosis child food allergy compare gold standard test OPT . We evaluate BAT 140 child food allergy compare result OPT time . If BAT result predict sensitivity child food allergen , could limit use OPT reduce risk test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Basophil Activation Test ( BAT ) Sensitivity Child Food Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Child food allergy represent 6 8 % child industrialised country . One third child develop severe reaction one third experience multiple allergy . In France , epidemiologic data 2005 F. Rancé evaluate prevalence allergy 6.7 % school child . Within food allergen , peanut , egg milk common . Currently , two diagnostic possibility : - A strong allergic reaction identify allergen specific IgE positive , make highly probable diagnosis . - A moderate allergic reaction suspicion allergen , without definitive diagnosis . When suspected allergy , gold standard diagnosis OPT . This test consist gradual ingestion suspect food allergen evaluate threshold cause clinical reaction . The OPT must perform medical supervision hospital due risk severe allergic reaction . The OPT gold standard allergy diagnosis . The test ( prick test , IgE specific measure… ) sensitive enough . Furthermore , level IgE specific relate risk develop clinical reaction food allergen . Some study try combine skin test result IgE specific measure sensitivity improve enough . New test develop diagnosis child food allergy without risk . The BAT cellular test able evaluate , blood , basophile activation specific allergen vitro . This test measure flow cytométrie expression activation molecule ( CD63 ) basophile ( CCR3+ ) incubation allergen . If patient sensitize allergen , percentage active basophile higher non sensitize people . This test allow u evaluate physiologically sensitization patient allergen . This test already test drug allergy milk allergy child . This clinical trial demonstrate mill allergy , BAT good sensitivity ( 91 % sensibility ( 96 % ) . Furthermore , study could determine threshold BAT child food allergy ( 6 % activated basophile ) . In light result , want evaluate advantage BAT compare OPT child allergy egg peanut . During study , perform BAT blood sample child suspect food allergy ( egg peanut ) OPT compare result OPT result . The primary objective study evaluate BAT interest predict result OPT analyse sensibility , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value BAT . If study demonstrate BAT predict OPT result child food allergy , able reduce number OPT patient reduce risk anaphylactic shock OPT .</detailed_description>
