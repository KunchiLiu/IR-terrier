	<brief_title>Establishing Learning Curves Virtual Simulation Training Mastoidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repeat surgical simulation train know provide good learn long-term transfer . The learn curve mastoidectomy procedure intensively study . The study conduct learn curve mastoidectomy date find plateau performance 4 medical student 4 mastoidectomy procedure separate occasion . The participant however assess use unvalidated , unestablished simulator integrate overall performance score . There therefore need establish learn curve plateau use establish objective assessment scale , could implications future study large scale future organization temporal bone dissection course . The long-term effect learn deliberate repeat simulator train mastoidectomy procedure previously study . The role cognitive load learn complex surgical technical skill simulation study great detail . The relationship time progress/performance assessment use Final Product Analysis ( FPA ) study . We previously suggest tutor-function volumetric approach green light procedural step could effect performance . The effect tutor function could however isolate .</detailed_description>
