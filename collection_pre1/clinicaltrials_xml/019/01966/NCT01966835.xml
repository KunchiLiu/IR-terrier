	<detailed_description>Poor sleep quality sleep disturbance common patient rheumatoid arthritis associate increase risk co-morbidity , include cardiovascular disease , diabetes , hypertension , all-cause mortality . In addition , poor sleep quality associate fatigue , pain physical disability . Few study examine possibility improve sleep patient rheumatoid arthritis , focus primarily medical treatment . Aerobic exercise training constitutes potentially promising , non-pharmacological alternative improve sleep healthy people patient insomnia . The present study blind randomize control trial 44 patient diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis . The aim examine effect aerobic exercise intervention , consist 18 exercise session , sleep quality sleep disturbance patient rheumatoid arthritis experience poor sleep quality . The primary hypothesis moderate high intensity aerobic exercise improve objective measure ( polysomnography ) sleep quality sleep disturbance . The secondary hypothesis intervention may improve fitness , subjective sleep quality physical function well reduce pain , fatigue , depressive symptom improve health-related quality life . The study provide evidence effect moderate-to-high-intensity aerobic exercise improvement sleep patient rheumatoid arthritis . Specifically , result expect provide important evidence potential interval training improve quality sleep sleep disturbance . As , study meet currently unmet need non-pharmacological treatment initiative poor sleep patient systemic inflammatory disorder .</detailed_description>
