	<brief_summary>Epidemic viral disease become prevalent recent year . Among various strategy prevent epidemic , vaccination cost-effective . However , population immunize typically already expose multiple previous vaccination natural infection . Studies laboratories reveal pre-existing dengue antibody either inhibit enhance subsequent dengue infection depend pre-existing antibody level . While cross-reactive antibody potentially pathogenic dengue , impact immune response vaccination unclear . Indeed , aggregate site vaccination respective drain lymph node antigen-presenting immune regulatory cell express Fc receptor play pivotal role determine magnitude polarity immune response . Vaccine uptake antigen-presenting cell may thus either inhibited enhance vaccine opsonize cross-reactive antibody . In view limited knowledge cross-reactive antibody affect vaccination outcome , investigator propose study exploit know cross reactivity Japanese encephalitis ( JE ) virus antibody yellow fever ( YF ) vaccine . Investigators hypothesize cross-reactive antibody impact antibody response YF point vaccination concentration-dependent manner alter vaccine uptake innate immune response antigen present cell . Investigators structure open label clinical trial sequential vaccination JE YF vaccine , different time interval vaccination . This would test immune response YF vaccination subject different titer cross-reactive JE vaccine-derived antibody .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Pre-existing Cross-reactive Antibodies Determining Efficacy Vaccination Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective clinical study examine role cross-reactive antibody modulate immune response vaccine . 1 . Hypothesis : Antibody response YF vaccination influence heterologous antibody titer point YF vaccination . 2 . Hypothesis : Heterologous antibody YF affect magnitude vaccine uptake Fc receptor alters quality magnitude innate immune response follow YF vaccination , previously show predictive immune response YF vaccination . Secondary objective 1 . To determine neutralize antibody response YF vaccination human volunteer different time interval follow prior JE vaccination . 2 . To characterize innate immune response YF vaccination different time interval prior JE vaccination . A total 100 healthy adult , pre-screened negative anti-dengue antibody enrol upon write informed consent . 75 subject test arm receive 2 dos inactivate JE vaccine ( Ixiaro ) , 25 subject control arm JE vaccination . Subjects test arm sub-divided 3 group receive YF17D : Group1.YF vaccination 1-month post-JE vaccination Group 2.YF vaccination 4-months post-JE vaccination Group 3.YF vaccination 9-months post-JE vaccination Subjects control arm ( group 4 ) receive YF vaccination time group 1 . Blood sample relation YF17D vaccination : 1 . Pre-dose 2 . 1-day 3 . 3-days ( + 1 day ) 4 . 1-week ( ± 2 day ) 5 . 1-month ( ± 5 day ) 6 . 1-year ( ± 14 day ) Primary end-point : Difference geometric mean titre YF17D neutralizing antibody .</detailed_description>
