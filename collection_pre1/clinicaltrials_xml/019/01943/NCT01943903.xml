	<detailed_description>The OVERALL OBJECTVE post-market , multicenter , longitudinal , prospective , consecutive cohort study compare clinical outcome , resource utilization , quality life ( QOL ) subject receive standard practice evaluation treatment versus subject receive FFRCT-guided evaluation treatment subject suspect CAD order inform patient , health care provider , stakeholder technology effective efficient diagnosis CAD . Cohort 1 study ass outcomes incorporate standard practice evaluation Cohort 2 ass outcome incorporate FFRCT-guided evaluation . Each Cohort delineate base upon initial presentation , whereas subject present initial non-invasive testing designate Cohorts 1A 2A ; subject already refer ICA designate Cohorts 1B 2B . SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES sequential cohort comparison : 1 . To compare rate ICA document non-obstructive coronary artery disease , clinical outcome , QOL follow standard practice diagnostic treatment planning modality Cohort 1 versus incorporate FFRCT preferred test guide invasive management medical treatment Cohort 2 ; 2 . To compare resource utilization follow standard practice diagnostic treatment pathway Cohort 1 versus incorporate FFRCT preferred test guide invasive management medical treatment Cohort 2 ; 3 . To provide support data generate new guideline diagnosis prognosis CAD comparative analysis risk stratification Updated Diamond-Forrester risk model ( UDF ) ; 4 . To provide society include patient , health care providers stakeholder information diagnostic technology effective efficient manage patient CAD .</detailed_description>
