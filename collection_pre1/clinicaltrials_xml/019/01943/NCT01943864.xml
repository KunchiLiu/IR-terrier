	<brief_summary>This Phase IIa , open-label , single-arm , multi-center study evaluate efficacy safety orally administer MEK inhibitor trametinib second line subject advance metastatic biliary tract cancer ( BTC ) Japanese population . The primary endpoint study 12 week non-progressive disease ( PD ) rate define percentage subject without progression Week 12 . As sub-study , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) four tablet 0.5 milligram ( mg ) tablet , one tablet 2 mg tablet achieve 2 mg daily regimen assess evaluate pharmacokinetics trametinib Japanese population . Eligible subject randomize receive trametinib recommend Phase II dose 2 mg every day one 2 mg tablet four 0.5 mg tablet Day 1 . From Day 2 disease progression withdrawal study treatment , subject receive one tablet 2 mg trametinib . Disease assessment perform every 8 week . Translational research also plan evaluate potential blood tumor tissue-derived biomarkers biological activity , sensitivity resistance treatment trametinib .</brief_summary>
