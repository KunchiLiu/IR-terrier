	<brief_summary>This open-label repeat dose , multicenter , 2-part study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) GSK525762 give once-daily ( OD ) orally twice daily ( BID ) orally . Part 1 study dose escalation phase select recommend Part 2 dose ( RP2D ) base safety , PK , PD profile observe oral administration GSK525762 . Eligible subject relapse refractory hematological malignancy enrol OD and/or BID dose cohort MTD establish . Subjects may continue treatment study disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent . Part 2 explore clinical activity MTD RP2D ; separate expansion cohort plan acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL , include exploratory sub-cohort subject myc B-Cell Leukemia ( BCL ) 2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements/overexpression [ double- triple-hit lymphoma ] ) , multiple myeloma ( MM ) . This first study agent conduct subject relapse and/or refractory hematological malignancy standard therapy anticipate result durable remission .</brief_summary>
