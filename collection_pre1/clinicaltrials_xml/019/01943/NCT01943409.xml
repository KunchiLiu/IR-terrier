	<brief_summary>Intravenous nutrition important therapy recovery many patient . It indicate patient take food mouth use intestine feed . It important indicate appropriate setting 's free complication costly treatment . Some complication : elevate blood sugar lipid , elevate liver function test , infection catheter device use administer intravenous nutrition . Intravenous nutrition compose protein , lipid , carbohydrate ( sugar form glucose ) vitamins . Until recently , Intralipid , soybean oil-based lipid emulsion lipid available Canada kind nutrition . Since 2010 , new lipid emulsion ( ClinOleic ) base olive-oil approved Health Canada use intravenous nutrition . There increase need hospital evaluate quality intravenous nutrition administer hospitalized patient term : assessing indication , prescription , complication , clinical result cost . The objective study determine intravenous nutrition prescribe hospitalized patient indicate follow exist guideline term time nutrition support , prescription , monitor whether associated complication . In addition , length stay mortality assess . Also , evaluate nutritional , infectious inflammatory parameter patient receive soybean oil-based lipid emulsion ( Intralipid ) compare patient receive olive oil-based lipid emulsion ( ClinOleic ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Until recently , Intralipid , soybean oil-based lipid emulsion , available lipid intravenous use Canada . In 2010 , ClinOleic , new , predominantly olive oil base emulsion , approve Health Canada alternative lipid . There increase need hospital quality-assurance study in-patient parenteral nutrition ( PN ) ass indication , PN prescription , complication , clinical outcome cost . The in-patient population well study intensive care unit ( ICU ) population . Several meta-analyses show PN associate high infection rate , long length stay high mortality compare enteral nutrition . Results study basis Canadian ICU Guidelines . The aim study determine PN prescribe in-patients indicated , appropriately follow exist guideline term time nutrition support , prescription monitoring , whether associate complication . In addition , clinical outcome length stay mortality assess . Also , evaluate metabolic , nutritional , infectious inflammatory parameter patient receive soybean oil-based lipid emulsion compare patient receive olive oil-based lipid emulsion .</detailed_description>
