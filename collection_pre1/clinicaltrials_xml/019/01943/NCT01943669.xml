	<brief_summary>In study , 10 volunteer participant chronic spinal cord injury undergo 10-week training schedule ambulation ReWalk™ device . The ReWalk™ consist lightweight brace-support suit contain motor hip knee joint , rechargeable battery computerize control system carry backpack . ReWalk™ user control ambulation subtle change centre gravity upper-body movement . Before , train session volunteer perform standardised assessment complete questionnaire assess functional psychological effect exoskeleton . Functional outcome primarily focus ambulation outcomes psychological outcome primarily focus predisposition perception disability . The outcome pilot study assist investigator preparation randomise control trail assess efficacy ReWalk™ device neurorehabilitation setting .</brief_summary>
