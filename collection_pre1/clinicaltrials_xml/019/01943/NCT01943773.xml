	<brief_summary>Purpose : To compare post-operative functional outcome patient undergo preoperative functional prehabilitation versus standard care preoperative management older adult undergo major elective operation . Hypothesis : Older adult undergo preoperative functional prehabilitation ( nine session home physical therapy three week ) improve physical function reduce delirium comparison usual preoperative care follow major abdominal thoracic operation . Specific Aims : ( # 1 ) To compare difference time up-and-go , Mini Mental Status Exam ( MMSE ) , de Morton Mobility Index , Modified Physical Performance Test ( MPPT ) , short physical performance battery score control intervention group preoperative initial assessment timepoints . ( # 2 ) To compare difference time up-and-go , Mini Mental Status Exam ( MMSE ) , de Morton Mobility Index , Modified Physical Performance Test ( MPPT ) , short physical performance battery score control intervention group 60-days postoperative initial assessment timepoints . ( # 3 ) To compare rate ICU delirium need post-discharge institutionalization patient control intervention group . ( # 4 ) To compare post-operative complication</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Prehabilitation study relation outcome surgery . One common area study affect post-operative outcome knee replacement patient . Prehabilitation find increase strength function old adult . { Swank , 2011 . # 1 } Prehabilitation increase leg strength ability perform functional task patient . Prehabilitation also study patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) . Primary outcome measure : anxiety length hospital stay ; secondary outcome measure : depression , physical functioning , cardiac misconception cost utility . Prehabilitation find decrease depression improve physical functioning . { Furze , 2009 . # 2 } Prehabilitation also find one study reduce postoperative complication , length stay , decline functional disability compare control group , improve quality life , patient cardiac abdominal surgery . { Carli , 2005 . # 3 } No research do link prehabilitation incidence delirium . The research team extensive experience study delirium . Decreased cognition functional ability link delirium poor outcomes post-operatively . { Robinson , 2009 . # 4 } . Theoretically , improve functional ability pre-operatively , post-operative outcome improve delirium decrease . This study examine true . The current standard care abdominal non-cardiac thoracic operation involve prehabilitation . ( Cardiac operation exclude due increase risk heart-related complication prehabilitation , Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) . ) The control group receive standard care pre-operative care , exception baseline functional assessment . OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary Outcome Variable : A timed up-and-go , Mini Mental Status Exam , de Morton Mobility Index , Modified Physical Performance Test ( MPPT ) , short physical performance battery perform 60 day follow operation . The difference time up-and-go short physical performance battery 60 day postoperatively initial assessment compare control intervention group . Secondary Outcomes : The secondary outcome variable rate need discharge institutional care facility ICU delirium . These two variable compare control intervention group . Other Outcomes : Evaluate post-operative complication . These two variable compare control intervention group . STUDY DESIGN AND RESEARCH METHODS Baseline Assessment : On study entry , participant time up-and-go , Mini Mental Status Exam , de Morton , Modified Physical Performance Test ( MPPT ) , short physical performance battery perform . Routine demographic perform . Traditional geriatric preoperative variable record . Study Groups : Participants randomize receive standard care ( control ) intervention prehabilitation . 1 . Control Group : The control group undergo routine pre-operative management . 2 . Intervention Group : The intervention consist nine 45 minute long physical therapy session . Sessions occur three time weekly patient 's home . Assessment Intervention Effectiveness : Immediately prior operation , participant undergo repeat time up-and-go , Mini Mental Status Exam , de Morton Mobility Index , Modified Physical Performance Test ( MPPT ) , short physical performance battery . The difference score preoperative assessment initial assessment enrollment compare control intervention group . Operations : The scheduled operation perform . Postoperative Adverse Outcomes : Postoperative adverse outcome record use standardized definition . DATA ANALYSIS PLAN A sample size 100 people , anticipate many complete Up Go 10 second faster screen fail . A total 40 subject randomize , 20 per group . The outcome time go , Short Physical Battery , Modified Physical Performance Test ( MPPT ) , de Morton compare baseline immediately pre-operatively immediately post-operatively . The data compare continuous variable use non-parametric T-test . Baseline demographic clinical data compare study control group use non-parametric chi square T-test appropriate .</detailed_description>
