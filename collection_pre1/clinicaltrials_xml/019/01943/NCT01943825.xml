	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate compress dosing schedule immunologic effect co-administration flavivirus JE vaccine . Primary Objectives : - To describe compare humoral immune response 4 parental dengue virus serotypes baseline 28 day CYD dengue vaccine dose . - To describe persistence humoral immune response 4 parental dengue virus serotypes 6 month CYD dengue vaccine Dose 3 , irrespective whether JE vaccine previously administer . Secondary Objectives : - To describe safety profile injection CYD dengue vaccine . - To describe humoral immune response 4 parental dengue virus serotypes baseline 28 day CYD dengue vaccine dose administer JE virus vaccine . - To describe persistence humoral immune response 4 parental dengue virus serotypes six month post-Dose 3 four group 12 month post dose 3 Groups 1 3 compressed schedule . - To describe JE humoral immune response 28 day injection CYD dengue vaccine .</brief_summary>
