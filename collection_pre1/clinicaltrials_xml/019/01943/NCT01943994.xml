	<brief_summary>One promising line investigation therapeutic use hallucinogens 1960s 1970s treatment drug dependence . We propose examine psilocybin administration combine structure smoke cessation treatment program nicotine dependent individual order provide preliminary data efficacy combine treatment smoke cessation . Prior work laboratory show carefully prepared supportive condition , psilocybin administration facilitate highly salient experience endure personal meaning spiritual significance ( Griffiths et al. , 2006 , 2008 ) . It plausible embed highly meaningful experience drug dependence cessation attempt may provide endure motivation remain abstinent .
