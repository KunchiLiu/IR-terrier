	<brief_summary>It hypothesize home-based computer game rehabilitation program improve gaze control balance impairment peripheral vestibular disorder ( PVD ) . Ten people peripheral vestibular disorder start treatment program consist play computer game perform various balance exercise . On weekly basis , participant contact email telephone ask submit computer game data train vestibular physical therapist . Following review data , physical therapist would contact participant progress computer game program appropriately . At completion twelve week home treatment , participant return re-assessment determine computer game program effective treatment PVD . It also determine monitored telerehabilitation program efficient effective delivery method treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A pre post intervention case series study carry ten participant diagnose peripheral vestibular disorder ( PVD ) . Inclusion criterion consist : ) 20 70 year old , b ) confirm diagnosis PVD neuro-opthalmic , neuro-orthoptic , electronystagmography caloric testing ; use home computer . Exclusion criterion consist migraine , central nervous system disorder ( example cerebral vascular accident Multiple Sclerosis ) , recent fracture spine low extremity , inability stand 20 minute continuously , presence dementia . It hypothesize home-based computer game treatment deliver monitored telerehabilitation platform would effective treatment PVD increase gaze stability improve balance would observe post-treatment . It also hypothesize decreased dizziness would report post-treatment . After initial assessment ( pre-treatment ) , three in-clinic session give participant develop specific home treatment computer program ensure ability use program effectively . They start home program monitor trained vestibular physical therapist 12-week telerehabilitation program . After completion 12-weeks , participant return post-treatment assessment .</detailed_description>
