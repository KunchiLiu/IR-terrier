	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Vemurafenib High-dose Interferon Alfa-2b Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Dose-selection dose-expansion study combination therapy high-dose interferon alfa-2b vemurafenib . - Vemurafenib standard dose 2 week lead-in period exploit potential immunomodulatory effect . Concurrent HDI follow ( week 2 onwards ) standard induction ( 4 week ) maintenance ( 48 week ) dos . - Modified Storer 's `` '' dose escalation schema use 3 fix dose level HDI fix sample size allow efficient identification recommend phase II dose . - 36-63 patient enrol depend toxicity parameter . oIn dose-selection portion , 3 patient enrol per dose level , start low dose level . Enrollment occur serially allow observation toxicity observation period . oIterative enrollment 3 subject per cohort continue total 30 evaluable subject enrol . oThe dose level RLT rate close 1/3 consider RP2D . oDuring dose-expansion portion trial , depend number patient treat RP2D dose-selection portion , additional patient may enrol - accrual target 36 patient treated RP2D .</detailed_description>
