	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Lumbar spinal stenosis - know patient `` arthritis spine '' - condition common ; find 30 % old adult . It common reason people age 65 back surgery . Some patient stenosis need back surgery treat method , physical therapy , chiropractic , exercise , medication . But n't enough good research tell u treatment work best patient circumstance . This research study hop provide information effectiveness various non-surgical choice manage stenosis . OBJECTIVES : This study directly compare effectiveness three common non-surgical treatment approach stenosis : 1 . Usual medical care involve prescription medication and/or spinal injection ( epidural ) 2 . Group exercise supervise class give community center set 3 . Hands-on ( manual ) therapy rehabilitative exercise give clinic set physical therapist chiropractor METHODS : This research study involve 180 adult least 60 year old diagnose lumbar spinal stenosis . The research volunteer divide three group , group receive one 3 type treatment list `` Objectives '' . The determination type treatment person receives determine chance , use computerized version flip coin . This process know randomization , scientist think reduces bias research study . A series test questionnaire give patient get treatment comparison make see much improvement make type treatment . Finally , researcher compare difference 3 treatment group see certain type treatment produce well result others , examination finding could use predict type patient would better type treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS ) condition highly prevalent senior citizen population . LSS frequent indication spinal surgery patient age 65 year . The fast growth lumbar surgery U.S. past decade occur old adult LSS rate complex fusion procedure increase 15-fold . These surgical procedure associate significant health care cost , risk , complication , re-hospitalization rate . Yet , evidence lack effectiveness various non-surgical treatment offer patient LSS . This knowledge gap greatly hinder development clinical practice guideline relevant non-surgical treatment approach LSS . OBJECTIVES : This study perform comparison three common approach non-surgical management treatment patient LSS . The specific research question associate study : ( 1 ) How group exercise manual therapy rehabilitative exercise compare usual medical care ? ( 2 ) How group exercise manual therapy rehabilitative exercise compare ? ( 3 ) Are baseline predictor associate clinical improvement non-surgical treatment approach ? The long term objective study produce research evidence relevant community stakeholder inform good decision make non-surgical treatment option available LSS patient . METHODS : This comparative effectiveness study utilize research design randomize controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) . It 3-group RCT allow pragmatic treatment approach three study arm . The study sample consist 180 old adult ( &gt; 60 year ) symptoms consistent diagnosis LSS , confirm clinical examination diagnostic imaging . Eligible subject randomize one three pragmatic treatment approach : 1 ) usual medical care ; 2 ) group exercise ; 3 ) manual therapy rehabilitative exercise . All subject treat 6-week course care . Primary outcome measure two validate research measurement tool ; Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire ( self-reported pain/function ) Self Paced Walking Test ( performance-based measure ) . We also employ novel secondary outcome measure ; Sense Wear Armband provide real-time measure physical activity normal daily living .</detailed_description>
