The sample consist low middle income African- Hispanic-Americans Caucasian male female child age 8-10 . The sample size consist equal number boy girls equal representation child socioeconomic condition ( i.e . low middle income ) ethnicity ( African Hispanic Americans Caucasians ) identify . The design consist two independent group base SES crossover , repeated-measures ( within subject across subject design , three breakfast condition . The outcome measure ( dependent variable ) include battery neuropsychological measure . All participate subject admit Children 's Nutrition Research Center ( CNRC ) Metabolic Research unit ( MRU ) three time overnight stay interval least 2 week apart across 3 month .</detailed_description>
