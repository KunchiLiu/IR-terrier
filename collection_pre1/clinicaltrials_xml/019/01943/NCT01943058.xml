	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well megestrol acetate levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system work treat patient atypical endometrial hyperplasia endometrial cancer . Progesterone cause growth endometrial cancer cell . Hormone therapy use megestrol acetate levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system may fight endometrial cancer lower amount progesterone body make . It yet know whether megestrol acetate effective levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system treat atypical endometrial hyperplasia endometrial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Megestrol Acetate Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System Treating Patients With Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system ( IUS ) result histologic regression endometrial lesion ( complex atypical hyperplasia [ CAH ] grade 1 endometrial cancer [ EC ] ) comparable achieve oral megestrol ( megestrol acetate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare side effect profile , weight gain mood change well compliance assign treatment 2 treatment arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe fertility-related outcome , ovulation , menstrual pattern fertility abnormality determine usual workup ( e.g. , semen analysis ) , pregnancy delivery within 18-months treatment . II . To characterize incidence endocrine comorbidities ( e.g. , hypothyroidism , polycystic ovarian syndrome , diabetes ) . III . To characterize association level endoplasmic reticular ( ER ) stress protein kinase B ( Akt ) -activation endometrial sample clinicopathologic-response Progestin ( therapeutic progesterone ) therapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive megestrol acetate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 18 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive levonorgestrel-releasing IUS continuous release 18 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 month .</detailed_description>
