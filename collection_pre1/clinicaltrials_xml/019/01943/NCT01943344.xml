	<brief_title>Safety Performance Study Large Hole Vascular Closure Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , multi-centred , non-randomized pilot study investigate safety performance VIVASURE CLOSURE DEVICE™ . All patient undergoing procedure require arteriotomy range 18 24 F , via common femoral artery screen inclusion/exclusion criterion . If patient meet requirement clinical investigation , shall invite participate , provide informed consent shall subsequently assign subject number . Patient safety monitor closely Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) . Safety data report DSMC every patient report complication . The DSMC adjudicate safety data determine whether safe continue enrolment . Subjects shall 1 , 3 12 month follow-up assessment . Safety data follow-up assess Data Safety Monitoring Committee . This protocol adopt VARC-2 definition major vascular complication associate closure access site . This pilot study enrol approximately 10 subject . The study design support large CE Mark study . As , study safety assessment complete patient complete 1 month follow-up assessment . The Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) review complication recommend whether safe proceed CE Mark study . All patient continue follow 1 , 3 12 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Over 18 year age . Each patient , guardian legal representative , willing give inform consent . Clinically indicated endovascular procedure involve access femoral artery , access puncture 18 24 F. Females pregnant lactating , plan become pregnant ≤ 12 month . A pregnancy test may perform confirm . There exclusion patient trial respect race , coexistent disease concomitant therapy , exception list . Severe acute noncardiac systemic disease terminal illness life expectancy le one year . Evidence systemic bacterial cutaneous infection , include groin infection . Evidence MRSA ( Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus ) and/or VRE ( vancomycinresistant Enterococci ) colonisation . With arterial access common femoral artery . * Patients suffer definitive potential coagulopathy platelet count less 100,000/µl . Patient haematocrit le 32 % . A measured activated clotting time ( ACT ) great 350 second immediately prior sheath removal . * If patient expect continuously treat anticoagulation therapy postprocedure ACT reading expect elevate 350 second 24 hour procedure . Evidence arterial diameter stenosis great 20 % within 20 mm arteriotomy . * Circumferential calcification within 20 mm arteriotomy . * Use systemic thrombolytic agent within 24 hour prior catheterisation procedure cause concentration fibrinogen le 100 mg/dl . Patients arteriotomy less 18 F great 24 F.* Known allergy material use device ( Refer Instructions Use ) . Currently enrol investigational clinical study , primary endpoint yet achieve . Patients judge unsuitable surgical repair access site . If puncture site via vascular graft . If indication puncture make profunda femoris locate less 10 mm profunda femoris . * Patients common femoral artery lumen diameter less 7 mm . Patients low extremity amputation access site limb . Patients undergone percutaneous procedure use nonabsorbable vascular closure device ( exclude suture mediate ) haemostasis ipsilateral leg . Patients undergone percutaneous procedure great 8 F ipsilateral leg , within previous 90 day . Patients undergone percutaneous procedure 8 F less use absorbable intravascular closure device haemostasis , ipsilateral leg , within previous 90 day . Patients undergone percutaneous procedure 8 F less use suture mediate closure device haemostasis , ipsilateral leg , within previous 30 day . Patients undergone percutaneous procedure 8 F less use manual/mechanical pressure haemostasis ipsilateral leg , within previous 30 day . Patients acute haematoma size , arteriovenous fistula Pseudoaneurysm access site . * Significant blood loss/transfusion interventional procedure within 20 day prior procedure require transfusion great 4 unit blood . * Angiographic evidence arterial laceration , dissection stenosis within external iliac femoral artery use VCD . * May know patient give informed consent procedure start .</criteria>
