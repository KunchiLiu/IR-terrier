	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial study side effect best way give stereotactic body radiation therapy T-cell infusion treat patient metastatic kidney cancer . Giving total body irradiation T-cell infusion stop growth cancer cell stop divide kill . After treatment , stem cell collect patient 's blood store . Chemotherapy give prepare bone marrow stem cell transplant . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Conduct safety feasibility study stereotactic radiotherapy autologous T-cell infusion patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression free survival one year . II . Determine overall survival one year . OUTLINE : STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIATION THERAPY ( SBRT ) : Patients undergo standard care SBRT 1-2 week accord tumor volume location . LYMPHODEPLETION : Beginning 3 week later , patient receive cyclophosphamide orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 3 day . REINFUSION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS ( PBMC ) : Within 3-14 day complete lymphodepletion cyclophosphamide , patient undergo autologous PBMC infusion . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 week , 4 week , monthly thereafter .</detailed_description>
