	<brief_title>Pectoral Nerve Blockade Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomization : 20 patient randomize 2 group . Both group receive paravertebral block 4 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine six level . Group A : Active group 10 cc 0.375 % ropivacaine ( 16 ) pectoral nerve block Group S : Placebo group 10 cc normal saline pectoral nerve block Blinding : The injectate content lateral pectoral nerve block blind personnel involve perform block , personnel involve general anesthesia personnel involve assess patient pain postoperative recovery period . Procedure : All study patient consent paravertebral block lateral pectoral nerve block per institutional standard . Pre-block procedure follow standard operating procedure institution include time , intravenous access , oxygen supplementation , electrocardiogram , pulse oximeter automate noninvasive blood pressure monitoring . Paravertebral block perform usual , describe Moller ( 17 ) . Patients sit position staff member stand front patient ensure safety . The surgical site mark front back patient dual confirmation consent patient . Mild sedation give use midazolam 2 mg fentanyl 100 µg . The superior aspect spinous process thoracic level C7-T5 identify palpation . The needle entry site mark 2.5 cm lateral spinous process ipsilateral operative breast . Using 22-gauge , Tuohy needle ( B Braun Medical Inc , Bethlehem , PA , USA ) attach via extension tube syringe , needle advance anteriorly parasagittal plane ( perpendicular back direction ) contact transverse process . The needle withdrawn subcutaneous tissue angle walk caudal edge transverse process . From caudal edge , advance anteriorly approximately 1 cm . ( 17 ) After negative aspiration syringe , 4 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine inject six level . These injection correspond T1-T6 spinal root level . The lateral pectoral nerve block perform describe Blanco ( 15 ) . A linear ultrasound probe ( L28 sonosite , Seattle , WA , USA ) place sagittal paramedian fashion inferior lateral third ipsilateral clavicle medial coracoid . Once pectoralis major muscle axillary artery identify , thoraco-acromial artery identify pectoralis major pectoralis minor muscle confirm color Doppler . The lateral pectoral nerve consistently locate adjacent artery . ( 15 ) Ten mL study injectate ( 16 ) deliver use in-plane technique via 80 mm echogenic ( Pajunk , Germany ) needle adjacent artery inter-pectoral plane . Care take avoid intramuscular intravascular injection . The content injectate blind personnel involve perform block , general anesthesia , post operative care . All patient proceed general anesthesia . Induction propofol maintenance desflurane . Airway management LMA without use muscle relaxant per standard practice . Fentanyl use intraoperatively treat pain . Hydromorphone use treat pain post- operative setting . No NSAID acetaminophen give route . For prevention post operative nausea vomiting , patient give 1.5mg scopolamine patch , 8 mg dexamethasone begin surgery , ( 18 ) 4 mg ondansetron closing . Any supplemental local anesthetic infiltration surgeon note . Assessment : Standard post anesthetic care unit assessment ( PACU ) numerical rating pain scale score perform per standard protocol . Hydromorphone use treat pain post-operative setting . If pain control inadequate , analgesic may prescribe discretion anesthesia provider involve case per standard practice . Additional anti-emetics may prescribe use whenever necessary . Data collection include total preoperative , intraoperative fentanyl total post- operative hydromorphone . Data collection conclude patient meet PACU discharge criterion 2 hour arousal , whichever sooner . Time PACU admission patient meet PACU discharge criterion record . Any supplementary local anesthetic analgesia also note . Prior PACU discharge , blind assessor ass patient reduce sensation cold distribution radial , ulnar , median nerve hand musculocutaneous nerve arm well motor integrity 4 say nerve . Patient grip strength measure surgical contralateral side grip dynamometer . Three iteration measurement take prior nerve block procedure patient ready discharge PACU . Patient satisfaction assess PACU discharge standard question , `` Thinking nerve block , satisfy : 1 , 4 middle , 7 completely satisfy ? '' score 7-point Likert scale . Any complication note , follow management per institution standard operate procedure . Known risk regional anesthesia include small risk infection , swell bleeding , extremely rare risk nerve damage , collapse lung , seizure , death . Unanticipated adverse event also report PI evaluation possible reporting HRRC , accord HRRC policy . Statistical analysis : Demonstrating non-blocked patient ' analgesic requirement differ hypothesize mean block patient α=0.05 80 % power require total sample size 16 ( 8/group ) . This estimate base observational data non-blocked patient practice , estimate minimum clinically-significant difference analgesic requirement expect blocked patient . We currently estimate enrollment 20 participant sufficient accumulate 16 complete protocol , apply HRRC amendment enroll necessary . Statistical analysis outcome ( opioid consumption , pain score , time discharge ) carry Wilcoxon test t-tests , appropriate . The remain outcome ( PONV incidence , incidence weakness modify sensation ipsilateral upper limb ) analyze proportion test .</detailed_description>
