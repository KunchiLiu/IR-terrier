	<detailed_description>Auto-CPAP device change therapeutic pressure base needs patient . Algorithms differ machine machine . This single-blind randomise crossover trial aim compare efficacy SPAP ( novel Auto-CPAP algorithm ) conventional CPAP . Up 50 patient recruit OSA population , age 18 . Participants consist male female patient diagnose moderate−severe OSA ( Apnea Hypopnea Index ( AHI ) great equal 15 per hour . Eligible participant , accord protocol approve Northern X Region Ethics Committee , provide write informed consent enrol study . Patients enrol sequentially accord randomisation list . Patients randomise CPAP SPAP . The therapeutic pressure base recent titration night patient . Comparisons data make use one-tailed t-test non-inferiority SPAP algorithm compare conventional CPAP therapy .</detailed_description>
