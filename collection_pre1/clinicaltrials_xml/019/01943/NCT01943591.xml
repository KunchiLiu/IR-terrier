	<brief_summary>Endovascular treatment platinum coil safe effective prevent rebleeding intracranial aneurysm . Unfortunately , endovascular treatment aneurysm coil associate incomplete occlusion initial treatment ( remnant ) follow-up ( recurrence ) . This study high 20 % . While many aneurysm remnant recurrence exhibit benign behavior , many require retreatment prevent future hemorrhage . A recent randomized control trial aneurysm coil reveal aneurysm 2 9.9 mm diameter likely improve angiographic composite clinical outcome treat hydrogel-coated coil , improvement infer result higher packing density afford hydrogel expansion ( 1 ) . The use hydrogel coil associate technical difficulty relate expansion limited time deployment . The investigator theorize similar result could achieve use voluminous bare platinum coil , lead improve packing density compare small caliber coil , thus result low incidence remnant residual . The relationship pack density composite clinical endpoint never show robust fashion , investigator therefore propose randomized clinical trial oppose coil soft 15-caliber coil 10-caliber bare platinum coil aneurysms vary size 3 9.9 mm . To test hypothesis 15-caliber coil system superior standard 10-caliber coil achieve well composite outcome , investigator propose DELTA trial : Does Embolization Larger coil lead well Treatment Aneurysms trial , randomize control blinded trial 2 subgroup 282 patient , 564 total : Subgroup 1 : Coiled maximum proportion 15-caliber coil condition allow Subgroup 2 : Coiled 10-caliber coil .</brief_summary>
