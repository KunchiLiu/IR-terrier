	<brief_title>Biomarkers Predict CRT Response Patients With HF ( BIOCRT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) biventricular pace emerge novel treatment congestive heart failure ( CHF ) responsive optimal drug therapy . CRT associate significant improvement hemodynamics functional status patient CHF . The physiologic effect CRT achieve via place electrical lead right leave ventricular wall , synchronize ventricular contraction . Over time , lead ventricular wall reverse remodeling , sustain improvement leave ventricular ejection fraction ( EF ) . Currently , indication CRT include end-stage heart failure class II-IV EF &lt; 35 % , QRS duration &gt; 120ms . The QRS duration use indicator degree ventricular electromechanical dyssynchrony , however , grow number study postulate inability predict response therapy . As result , measure mechanical dyssynchrony seek guide therapy . The vast majority study examine clinical , cardiac , electrocardiographic , device-specific index , however , widely accept predictor response CRT lacking . CRT result electromechanical synchrony , lead improve ejection fraction , exercise tolerance , reduction symptom . Although electrical re-synchronization intra-procedural hemodynamic improvement achieve device implant , sustained clinical improvement likely due ventricular reverse remodeling . A major issue CRT approximately third patient receive device achieve improve clinical functional status , fail undergo change ventricular geometry , ventricular remodeling . It remain unknown whether due abnormality factor involve lead placement procedural strategy , geometric remodeling , alteration cardiac energy metabolism , supply energy ( i.e . coronary blood flow ) , inappropriate/inadequate microvascular proliferation . This study evaluate series biochemical marker implicate pathophysiology heart failure , predict response CRT biventricular pacing .</detailed_description>
