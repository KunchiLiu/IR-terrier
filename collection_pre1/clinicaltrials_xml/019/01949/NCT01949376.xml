	<brief_title>Mild Cognitive Impairment Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim identify neuroimaging biomarkers predict mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) breast cancer patient receive adjuvant chemo and/or hormonal therapy examine hippocampal-cortical neurocircuitry . Adjuvant therapy increase long-term survival , produce change cognitive function 30 % ( 70 % ) woman average breast cancer . Cognitive decline negatively impact quality life patient supporter . Therefore , early identification patient risk develop treatment-related cognitive impairment need develop potential prevention treatment option prevent decline . Our recent work demonstrate patient receive adjuvant hormonal treatment exhibit decline cognition soon three month post treatment . Although neuroimaging study identify brain change associate chemotherapy ( `` chemo brain '' , investigation assess type severity change follow hormonal therapy , study determine individual great risk cognitive impairment . Our central hypothesis measure hippocampal-cortical integrity use predict cognitive decline , change specific domain cognitive performance patient receive adjuvant therapy time relate change specific component circuitry time .</detailed_description>
