	<brief_title>Capnography Monitoring During Intravenous Conscious Sedation Sedation With Midazolam Oral Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Intravenous sedation allow procedure perform dentistry , area medicine beyond operating room . Its application area tailor requirement relevant procedure , set level operator training expertise . The Academy Medical Royal Colleges emphasise speciality must produce form guidance use sedative technique . The following definition conscious sedation dentistry accept General Dental Council Dental Sedation Teachers Group : `` A technique use drug drug produce state depression central nervous system enable treatment carry , verbal contact patient maintain throughout period sedation . The drug technique use provide conscious sedation dental treatment carry margin safety wide enough render loss consciousness unlikely '' . The Standing Dental Advisory Committee Guidance 2003 , remain standard guidance UK , state : `` Any technique result loss consciousness define general anaesthesia UKm 'deep sedation ' consider within category '' . To summarise ; dental sedation lie within range minimal moderate sedation sedation continuum i.e . conscious sedation . Deep sedation avoid setting . Dentists complete recognised postgraduate course practice conscious sedation independently . For intravenous sedation , dentists use `` standard '' conscious sedation technique , define `` intravenous sedation '' , use midazolam alone . The drug titrate end-point ; rapid onset posse short duration action , mean midazolam useful field dental sedation . The current standard monitoring patient clinical monitoring , must supplement pulse oximetry blood pressure reading . The important side effect midazolam respiratory depression . Although generally consider safe practice , conscious sedation entirely risk-free.Ventilation ( breathe ) oxygenation relate seperate physiological process . During process sedation , clinicians rely pulse oximetry surrogate measure ventilation . Capnography , staple gold standard general anaesthesia , become increasingly important area interest procedural sedation , study settings suggest , capnography effective ventilatory monitor sedate patient . One significant limitation pulse oximetry lag time ; mean partial pressure oxygen may decrease significantly pulse oximeter signal fall . Reviewing literature Previous study capnography sedation difficult summarise . A review available literature show relative paucity randomise trial trial dental setting . Three trial setting summarise . Beitz et al ( 2012 ) : A total 760 patient enrol . Patients receive 2L/min supplemental oxygen . The intention-to-treat analysis reveal significant reduction incidence oxygen desaturation capnography arm comparison conventional arm ( 38.9 % vs. 53.2 % ) . The study conclusion additional capnography monitoring reduces incidence oxygen desaturation hypoxemia propofol sedation colonoscopy . Deitch et al ( 2010 ) : A total 132 patient emergency room setting . Hypoxia define SpO2 &lt; 93 % . The incidence oxygen desaturation capnography arm comparison conventional arm 25 % vs. 42 % . All patient receive supplemental oxygen ( 3L/minute ) . Conclusion : The addition capnography standard monitoring reduce incidence hypoxia provide advanced warning hypoxic event . Qadeer et al ( 2009 ) : This trial show significantly reduce rate hypoxia ( 46 % vs 69 % ) , define oximetry read &lt; 90 % 15 sec . There relatively large cohort ASA 3 patient study . 147 patient receive supplemental oxygen . The study conclusion capnography monitor respiratory activity improve patient safety procedural sedation elective endoscopy . Waugh et al ( 2010 ) conduct meta - analysis , main find procedural sedation , case respiratory depression 17.6 time likely detect monitored capnography case monitor capnography ( 95 % CI , 2.5-122.1 ) . The result three randomised trial meta-analysis generalise extrapolated standard dental sedation technique : 1 . Different patient population The reviewed study contain many elderly patient know sensitive sedative drug likely co - morbidity . For standard dental sedation age le 65 year . 2 . Supplemental Oxygen In standard dental technique patient breath room air . In reviewed study supplemental oxygen often administer . 3 . Drugs Different drug use achieve sedation review study e.g . Propofol Ketamine . 4 . Analgesia Local anaesthetic employ analgesia dentistry . In reviewed study , analgesia often achieve use intravenous agent opioids . The synergistic effect drug use combination likely result increased respiratory depression . 5 . Desaturation ( SpO2 ) For standard dental sedation technique SpO2 &lt; 95 % regard threshold early desaturation.This reasonable threshold set sedation administer non-anaesthetist outside operating room . In reviewed study threshold vary . Deitch et al use threshold &lt; 93 % Qadeer et al . &lt; 90 % . 6 . Depth sedation Varied study case beyond conscious sedation . Aim : The aim randomize , control study determine whether early intervention base upon data capnographic monitoring reduces incidence arterial oxygen desaturation midazolam sedation dentistry . Objectives : 1 . Determine early intervention base capnography influence incidence arterial oxygen desaturation . 2 . Characterise ETCO2 , respiratory rate SPO2 baseline pre sedation , sedation post sedation . This prospective , randomise control trial dental patient receive intravenous conscious sedation midazolam . Goal : To determine whether use dental team real - time capnography associate decrease incidence oxygen desaturation ( hypoxia ) compare standard monitoring alone intravenous sedation midazolam dentistry . Setting selection participant : Patients attend oral surgery department dental theatre sedation procedure Cork University dentalo school Hospital Cork University Hospital prospectively invite take part . Patients randomly assign study group ( standard monitoring capnography ) control group ( standard monitoring blind capnography ) . The sedation team blind randomisation choice enrolment . A member staff directly involve study conduct randomisation . There evidence utilise intravenous midazolam age group 14 16years ( post pubertal ) dentistry . Including age cohort ( parental consent ) provide additional research data add body evidence . Patients intravenous sedation midazolam primarily relief anxiety help accept invasive procedure . The operative procedure range simple extraction minor oral surgery procedure removal impacted wisdom teeth . Pre sedation visit : Patients assessed suitability sedation separate pre sedation visit Baseline capnography pulse oximetry data collect visit . Patients meet inclusion criterion give write information study . This information write lay language . Enrolment study take place begin subsequent treatment visit patient consent take part time consider information provide study pre assessment visit . Patients receive pre sedation instruction . Standard electronic monitoring ( pulse oximetry , pulse rate blood pressure ) available clinical staff time . Standard dental sedation use accord institution policy protocol . A capnostream 20 monitor ( Oridian medical , Needham , MA ) , use disposable oral - nasal CO2 cannula capable deliver oxygen , oral sample port accommodate mouth breathe attached patient . The capnostream 20 monitor display oximetry CO2 waveform calculate ETCO2 . The capnography monitor calibrate every day study . Continuous record SpO2 , Heart rate , ETCO2 respiratory rate store laptop computer via specialised software post hoc analysis . In addition , clinical staff keep paper record patient ' age , sex , body mass index , ASA status medical history . All patient assign code maintain confidentiality . Before study , clinician nursing staff train interpretation capnography relation respiratory depression include waveform interpretation . A laminated interpretation card attach monitor reminder . The sedation team perform conscious sedation accord standard protocol dental sedation . Intervention adverse event base judgement clinician expertise without capnography depend randomisation arm . In capnography arm , addition standard monitoring , change shape capnography waveform , ETCO2 numeric change consider trigger take measure avoid desaturation . In control group , capnography blind place opaque screen capnostream 20 capnographydisplay ETCO2 value , respiratory rate waveform . Pulse oximetry continue display . Baseline monitoring data obtain least 2 minute prior first infusion . Midazolam titrate rate one mg per minute end point . Most patient discharge 60 minute last increment provide fit discharge . We propose collect study data discharge . All patient receive write pre post sedation instruction . benzodiazepine antagonist , flumazenil available sedation suite time addition emergency drug equipment . The Null hypothesis state : The study group equal control group term hypoxemia rate i.e arterial oxygen desaturation .</detailed_description>
