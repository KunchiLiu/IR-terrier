	<brief_title>Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2b Versus Hydroxyurea Polycythemia Vera</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydroxyurea establish first-line treatment option currently approve several European country Polycythemia Vera ( PV ) patient require cytoreductive therapy ( Barbui et al , 2011 ) . Clinical trial show HU effective drug prevent thrombosis PV compare phlebotomy ( Michiels et al , 1999 ) . The main concern long term treatment HU potential leukaemogenicity : base mechanism action , HU potentially accelerate accumulation mutation DNA increase risk leukaemic transformation ( Dingli et Tefferi , 2006 ) . However , currently clear clinical data confirm leukaemogenicity HU patient PV ( Tefferi , 2012 ) . Even though IFN-alpha show activity PV 1980s , still consider experimental treatment Europe due pending approval indication ( Barbui et al , 2011 ) . It induce major complete molecular remission patient PV accompany reduction risk thrombosis bleed - major determinant morbidity indication ( Hasselbalch , 2011 ) . However , low dos tolerate significant adverse effect long-term use may limit usefulness . Pegylated interferon well tolerate preferred option treatment PV patient ( Kiladjian et al , 2008 ) despite lack evidence base well-designed randomized control clinical study . AOP2014 next generation pegylated interferon ( Peg-P-IFN-alpha-2b ) , addition proline N-terminal end . AOP2014 like interferon suppresses malignant clone cause PV subsequently expect possibly defer onset avoid long term sequela PV . In addition , reduction frequency phlebotomy achieve . The peg-P-IFN-alpha-2b might potentially positive impact reduce drop-out rate compare conventional IFNs . It expect reduced frequency administration AOP2014 contribute high compliance rate . The maximum tolerate dose well safety , efficacy pharmacokinetics AOP2014 assess phase I/II study patient PV . After 24 evaluable patient enter Phase I dose find part , MTD define level 540 µg administer every two week . Another 27 patient recruit order investigate drug efficacy safety PV . Efficacy result AOP2014 promising . By visit 18 , 53.0 % patient reach complete response ( 12 evaluable patient ) . Adverse event manageable rarely necessitated treatment discontinuation . AOP2014 show prolonged plasma half-life concomitant increase AUC . This expected enhance therapeutic window peg-IFN-alpha-2b . The safety profile type I interferons alpha believe well characterized clinical experience nearly 20 year . Since dose carefully titrate optimal effective dose additional risk patient expect . HU , IMP-comparator study , standard reference treatment PV . This phase III study design compare , first time , efficacy safety HU pegylated prolin-interferon alpha-2b ( AOP2014 ) patient PV . Two population assess : HU naïve patient patient currently treat pre-treated HU le 3 year , respond HU treatment ( accord criterion protocol ) .</detailed_description>
