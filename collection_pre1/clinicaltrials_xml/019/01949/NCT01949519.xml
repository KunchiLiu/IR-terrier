	<brief_summary>Docetaxel standard , first-line chemotherapeutic agent castrate resistant prostate cancer . While clinically useful activity , strong need substantial improvement efficacy . Possible way improve docetaxel monotherapy would combine agent either minimized toxicity ( thus allow high dos ) improve efficacy ( target synergistic pathway ) . Lycopene attractive agent combination docetaxel know accumulation prostate tissue , low toxicity , ability inhibit signal IGF-1 axis , reduce IL6 level . Lycopene highly synergistic docetaxel inhibit growth prostate cancer mouse . The purpose study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lycopene give combination docetaxel . This dose use subsequent phase II phase III study . New finding ECOG E3805 study present ASCO 2014 , show concurrent chemotherapy first-line ADT newly diagnose metastatic prostate cancer markedly improve overall survival compare delayed chemotherapy . These subject could also benefit intervention increase docetaxel effectiveness .</brief_summary>
