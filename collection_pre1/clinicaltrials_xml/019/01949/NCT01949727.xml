COPD create tremendous burden healthcare system , disease exacerbation result frequent , prolonged hospitalization . While originally consider disease specific lung , data show COPD associate substantial cardiovascular ( CV ) morbidity mortality . Exacerbations COPD require hospitalization result mark patient deterioration , heighten CV risk . The cause increase CV risk stable COPD , exaggerate CV risk exacerbation disease unknown ; however , may due chronic inflammation exacerbate flare-up disease , and/or chronic inactivity similarly worsen bed-rest hospitalization . Despite impact COPD healthcare , relatively study examine COPD inpatient care impact patient outcome , inflammation CV risk . Disease management program , pulmonary rehabilitation patient self-management education , part guideline therapy COPD ; however , regularly implement follow hospitalization , intervention affect patient outcome , behavior , physical activity , inflammation CV risk well study . The propose long-term project examine typical inpatient COPD care , early referral chronic disease management program hospital discharge , affect patient outcomes .

	<detailed_description>AIM 1 : Purpose : To examine pulmonary cardiovascular outcome COPD patient time acute hospital admission discharge . Rationale : AECOPD associate systemic inflammation , prolong bed-rest increased CV risk . Proper medical management strategy appropriate systemic corticosteroid , mobilization , bedside education may reduce systemic inflammation improve vascular function , improve patient self-efficacy health outcome reduce hospital length stay ( LOS ) . Hypothesis : Treatment-specific factor pharmacological management , patient education inpatient mobilization affect LOS , well pulmonary cardiovascular outcome discharge . Study Design : For cross-sectional study , consecutive patient admit University Alberta Hospital Pulmonary ward diagnosis AECOPD ( BNP &lt; 500 pg/ml Troponin &lt; 1.0 mcg/L ) , require ventilatory support form non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) , approach recruitment . In-hospital patient management leave discretion admit physician , follow new AHS admission order set AECOPD , base current guidelines1 . Dr Bhutani assist development order set . The order set standardize pharmacological non-pharmacological management AECOPD ; however , variance patient need time delivery intervention present . Treatment otherwise alter study , except time administration short act bronchodilator relate measurement arterial stiffness vascular function . 24 hour recruitment , research team begin collect patient/clinical treatment information daily basis ( see Appendix B list ) . 48 hour admission , patient give activity monitor quantify daily physical activity . On day , vascular assessment measurement pulse wave velocity , vascular function , lung function well serum marker systemic inflammation ( TNF-alpha , MMP-2 , IL-6 CRP ) exhale nitric oxide ( eNO ) , collect ( addition usual blood work require patient management ) . This repeat day 5 , 10 , day discharge day 14 post discharge . Self efficacy 6-minute walk test perform day discharge day 14 follow discharge , three-day physical activity determine 14 day post discharge . BODE index determine discharge 14 day post discharge ( see Appendix C data collection schedule ) . Subject Selection &amp; Recruitment : All Aims register ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) , submit approval University Alberta Health Research Ethics Board ( HREB ) , informed consent obtain study patient . Since patient COPD hospitalize initially present , assessed Emergency Department ( ED ) , recruit set ED study team . All patient diagnosis AECOPD admit pulmonary ward , meet criterion , screen enrollment . If enter study , baseline information ( Appendix A ) collect time . Through collaborative primary ED research activity , Dr Rowe 's Emergency Medicine Research Group maintain research nurse coverage U A hospital ED 07:00 - 23:00 Monday - Friday 10:00 - 20:00 Saturday Sunday . These research nurse act main recruitment source within University Alberta Hospital ED site lead Canadian recruitment centre number clinical research study . Eligible patient AECOPD approach enter study require informed write consent obtain . A Refused , Missed Otherwise ( RMO ) exclude database maintain determine feasibility large study ass generalizability enrol sample case . In event patient present research staff hour , patient approach research staff discus study obtain consent begin collection data . AHS data indicate ~450 COPD patient admit U A hospital year . Dr Rowe 's research team demonstrate success recruiting ED120,121 , therefore recruit 100 patient 2 year feasible Data Handling : Upon enrollment data collection form ( Appendix A ) complete patient ED research team . The research team collect patient/clinical treatment information daily ( see Appendix B ) , outcome data per protocol ( see Appendix C ) . Data Analysis : All data enter custom-developed secure anonymized database . Data analysis perform use StataCorp . 2009 . Stata Statistical Software : Release 11 ( College Station , TX : StataCorp LP ) . Continuous data report mean standard deviation ( SD ) median interquartile range ( IQR ) . Chi-square test use bi-variable analysis dichotomous variable ; continuous variable compare use t-tests Mann-Whitney test . Two-tailed result p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . The influence patient characteristic treatment factor dependent variable ( i.e . inflammation , vascular function , self efficacy LOS ) analyze multiple linear logistic regression model appropriate . For linear regression model , clinically relevant statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.1 level ) independent variable include . For logistic regression model , several dependent variable explore ; clinically relevant statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.1 level ) independent variable include . Sample size : A convenience sample COPD patient recruit effort make provide reasonable confidence interval important variable outcome ; minimum sample size 100 COPD case collect . This sufficient multiple regression analysis include 10 predictor would provide narrow 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) variable estimate ~10 % mid-range variable 6 % . extreme-range variable . AIM 2 : Purpose : To examine impact early PR follow hospital discharge QoL , pulmonary/CV outcome AECOPD hospitalization . Rationale : In addition typical improvement QoL exercise tolerance , study show PR increase self-efficacy , physical activity reduce CV risk stable COPD patient . Patients recently discharge hospital follow AECOPD represent sick patient greatly reduce QoL , exercise tolerance , self-efficacy physical activity greatly elevate CV risk . Exactly improve PR reduce CV risk hospitalization follow PR require examination . Hypothesis : Patients receive early PR improve QoL , pulmonary/CV outcomes less hospitalization COPD 6 month follow hospital discharge . PR improve self efficacy , physical activity QoL reduce CV risk compare usual care . Study Design &amp; Subject Recruitment : All patient admit pulmonary ward AECOPD , include complete Aim 1 , offer participation arm study . Patients find acute cardiac injury admission , mobility issue residence outside great Edmonton area exclude . Consenting patient subsequently randomize one two group : early PR versus usual care . Patients randomize early PR enrol within 1 month discharge PR program , usual care patient followed-up responsible physician determine admit team . The PR group enrol Breathe Easy Program Center Lung Health , proceed program typical fashion . All patient follow 6 month discharge interview assess disease status , management review history recurrence relapse AECOPD . Hospital admission length stay data obtain electronic medical record . Patient assessment include : quality life , 6min walk , dyspnea , self-efficacy , physical activity , pulse wave velocity , vascular function , systemic inflammation ( TNFα , MMP-2 , IL-6 CRP ) FeNO . All data collect , immediately 6month PR . The control group data collect scheduled time . See description method . Data Handling : Data enter onto secure anonymized database . Data Analysis : The influence PR QoL , 6min walk , dyspnea , self-efficacy , physical activity , pulse wave velocity , vascular function , systemic inflammation eNO analyze use multivariate mixed-model MANOVA treatment ( PR vs. usual care ) fix between-group variable time ( pre , immediate post , 6months post ) repeat variable . Sample size : Based previous work84,95,96,101-105 , sample size 50 group ( 100 total ) sufficient detect between-group difference QoL , 6min walk , PWV , dyspnea hospital readmission rate follow PR ( α=0.05 , β=0.8 ) . Based recent work , sample could detect 10 % difference physical activity follow PR ( α=0.05 , β=0.8 ) . One hundred patient also allow stratification physiological psychological response PR .</detailed_description>
