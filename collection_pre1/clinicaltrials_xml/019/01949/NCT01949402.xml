	<brief_summary>There increase interest thoracic ( chest ) ultrasound might enhance management patient respiratory failure breathlessness , particularly emergency admission intensive care set . Thoracic ultrasound already use number clinical setting . It recognise number lung abnormality identify use thoracic ultrasound , consolidation ( pneumonia ) peripheral soft tissue lesion ( lung cancer ) . Furthermore , thoracic ultrasound offer clinicians non-invasive diagnostic tool provide immediate feedback result . Patients breathlessness respiratory failure represent significant proportion emergency admission hospital commonly require urgent treatment limited information available guide clinician . The range diseases present breathe difficulty broad ( e.g . pneumonia , heart failure , pulmonary embolus ) difficult differentiate patient often multiple medical problem . This lead non-specific treatment face diagnostic uncertainty associate risk treatment complication , increase morbidity mortality , distress patient relatives . It assessment patient acute respiratory failure thoracic ultrasound might greatest benefit research design address . This single centre study ( Churchill Hospital , Oxford ) recruit 125 participant eight month period . The study test reliability thoracic ultrasound protocol identify lung abnormality stable outpatient population respiratory disease ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ; interstitial lung disease ; patient haemodialysis replicate acute pulmonary oedema / heart failure ) . It hop result study inform research acutely unwell patient respiratory failure breathlessness see whether thoracic ultrasound improve diagnostic therapeutic decision .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study form part educational research intend ultimately contribute towards high degree ( MD DPhil ) . The study co-ordinated Oxford Respiratory Trials Unit , Churchill Hospital , Oxford develop study co-ordinator ( Dr Corcoran ) Chief Investigator ( Dr Rahman ) support Professor Gleeson . This study ass efficacy TUS identify extravascular lung water ( EVLW ) presence absence B-lines ( also know `` comet tail '' ) ultrasound ; whilst also determine whether TUS distinguish pulmonary pathology may cause similar ultrasonographic appearance respiratory compromise . A TUS protocol test validated stable patient population , concurrently assess patient operator satisfaction tool . It intend result study inform large second-phase study modify TUS protocol acute clinical setting ( medical admission unit +/- emergency department ) . Potential participant study screen normal clinical care relevant department Churchill Hospital , Oxford - i.e . specialist COPD ILD clinic respiratory department ; outpatient haemodialysis unit renal department . Healthy volunteer also seek use advertisement place noticeboards Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust select Oxford University department . All participant enrol study undergo CT thoracic ultrasound scan per study protocol . These low-risk intervention harm expect direct consequence participation study . Participants also undergo baseline spirometry ( do last month ) blood test purpose study ; also consider low-risk intervention harm expect direct consequence participation study . The study involve single visit therefore impose minimal burden participant , majority participant study visit arrange coincide pre-arranged trip hospital normal clinical care ( e.g . regular haemodialysis outpatient clinic visit ) .</detailed_description>
