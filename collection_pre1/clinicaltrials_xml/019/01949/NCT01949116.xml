	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Effectiveness Low-Dose Methotrexate Reducing Inflammation HIV-Infected Adults Taking Antiretroviral Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-infected people take ART high expect risk premature CVD . Many factor likely contribute risk , include chronic inflammation . Strategies reduce inflammation HIV-infected people may beneficial reduce CVD risk , well condition , include kidney disease , bone disease , neurologic complication . MTX anti-inflammatory medication use treat people rheumatoid arthritis . This study evaluate safety effectiveness LDMTX treat inflammation endothelial function virologically suppress HIV-infected adult CVD increase risk CVD . The total study duration 36 week . Prior enrol study , participant chest X-ray . Participants randomly assign receive LDMTX placebo 24 week . Participants continue take antiretroviral ( ARV ) medication usual ; ARVs provide study . At study entry , participant undergo medical medication history , physical examination , blood collection , adherence assessment . From study entry Week 1 , participant receive either 5 mg MTX placebo week . For participant clinically stable Week 1 study visit , dose MTX placebo increase 10 mg week Week 12 . For participant clinically stable Week 12 study visit , dose MTX placebo increase 15 mg week Week 24 . Participants meet criterion dose escalation re-evaluated follow study visit . In addition LDMTX placebo , participant also receive 1 mg folic acid day study entry throughout Week 24 . After take final dose LDMTX placebo , participant continue take folic acid additional 4 week . Additional study visit occur Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 . They include physical examination , blood collection , adherence assessment ; arm ultrasound test also perform Weeks 12 24 . At Week 2 , participant also take part pharmacokinetic ( PK ) assessment , involve undergo blood collection several time 6-hour period .</detailed_description>
