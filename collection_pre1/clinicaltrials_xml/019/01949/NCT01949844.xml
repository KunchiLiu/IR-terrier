	<brief_summary>This pilot study patient population suspect Coronary Artery Disease CAD ) define presence abnormal nuclear ( PET/SPECT ) perfusion scan . In study design , PET/SPECT serve comparative standard presence myocardial ischemia . We intend determine accuracy novel MR technique localization perfusion deficit comparison PET/SPECT . This study specifically evaluate efficacy safety drug rather diagnostic accuracy cardiac MRI procedure whole</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Artifact-Free High-Resolution Myocardial Perfusion MRI Subjects With Abnormal Nuclear Myocardial Perfusion Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 2 imaging protocol use study : ( 1 ) One-day SPECT protocol , involve subject undergo stress myocardial perfusion SPECT MRI day ; ( 2 ) Two-day PET/SPECT protocol , involve MRI subject recent abnormal PET/SPECT study include optional second-day visit . Two blind reader interpret MR SPECT/PET study consensus assess presence perfusion deficit stress rest .</detailed_description>
