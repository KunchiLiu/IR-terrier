	<brief_title>( SBRT ) ( ART ) Pulmonary Metastases From Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 20 people expect participate study Medical College Wisconsin/Froedtert Hospital . Patients follow three year . The usual treatment sarcoma spread lung remove cancer surgery . Patients surgery prefer surgery , receive radiation therapy . Standard radiation therapy involve several week daily treatment session , although effective surgery may seriously damage normal surround lung tissue . Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) radiation treatment give few high dos radiation standard radiation . SBRT use treat metastasis lung many type cancer use often patient metastatic disease lung sarcoma . The purpose study test possibility SBRT lung metastatic disease lung . This information use find factor predict recovery outcome patient metastatic disease lung sarcoma . SBRT consist 1 3 treatment per week total 3 5 treatment tumor therapy complete . After SBRT complete , follow-up exam occur 4-6 week completion radiation treatment , every 3 month year 1 every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
