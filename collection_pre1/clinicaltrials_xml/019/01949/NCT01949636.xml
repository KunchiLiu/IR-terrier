	<detailed_description>Obese v lean human show great gustatory/oral somatosensory reward region responsivity palatable food images/cues predict future weight gain ( Yokum et al. , 2011 ; Stice et al. , 2008 , 2010b ; Stoeckel et al. , 2008 ) , line reward surfeit incentive sensitization model obesity ( Berridge , 2009 ; Davis et al. , 2004 ) . Yet , obese vs lean human few dopamine ( DA ) receptor striatal reward region , show reduce striatal response palatable food intake , low striatal response predict future weight gain genetic risk reduce DA signaling ( Felsted et al. , 2010 ; Stice et al. , 2008 ; Wang et al. , 2001 ; Volkow et al. , 2008 ) , line reward deficit model obesity ( Wang et al. , 2002b ) . One explanation mixed finding finding reflect initial risk factor others result overeat . Firing DA neuron reward region shift food intake cue predict food intake conditioning ( Kiyatkin et al. , 1994 ; Schultz et al. , 1993 ) overeat lead reduce D2 receptor density , D2 sensitivity , reward sensitivity rat ( Alsio et al. , 2010 ; Kelley et al. , 2003 ; Johnson &amp; Kenny , 2010 ) striatal response food human ( Stice et al. , 2010a ) , imply overeat lead increase incentive sensitization down-regulation reward region . Further , reduce inhibitory region response food images/cues predict future overeat weight gain ( Cornier et al. , 2010 ) . Data imply youth risk obesity initially show great responsivity region encode reward value food cue , couple great responsivity gustatory/oral somatosensory region encode sugar fat content food , reduce inhibitory region responsivity , lead overeating/weight gain produce blunt striatal DA signaling , increase responsivity reward valuation region food cue , reduce inhibitory activation response food stimulus , increase risk overeating/weight gain . We propose conduct rigorous test dynamic-vulnerability model use novel repeat measure fMRI design teen complete scan annually 4 year . Aim 1 : test whether elevated gustatory/oral somatosensory reward region responsivity reduce inhibitory region responsivity palatable food image , cue , intake food vary sugar/fat content , behavioral inhibitory control deficits/immediate reward bias predict initial increase % body fat 130 lean teen . Aim 2 : use growth curve model test whether initial increase % body fat energy dense food intake predict future decrease striatal response palatable food receipt , increase reward circuitry response palatable food images/cues , decrease inhibitory region response food images/cues , increase behavioral inhibitory control deficits/immediate reward bias . Aim 3 : test whether decreased striatal response palatable food , increase reward region response food images/cues , reduce inhibitory region response food images/cues , behavioral inhibitory control deficits/immediate reward bias predict escalation % body fat .</detailed_description>
