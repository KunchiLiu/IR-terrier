	<brief_summary>The diagnosis iron overload common problem . It important optimize diagnosis ensure support patient relatives especially regarding genetic disease . Iron overload reveal high level serum ferritin confirm presence excessive amount iron liver frequent situation . In lot case increase serum iron transferrin saturation . This situation may arise particular patient : - genetic iron overload relate mutation ferroportine gene , lead ferroportin disease . The diagnosis base sequence gene , - dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis , frequent situation , iron overload associate abnormality metabolism carbohydrates fat , whereas genetic cause identify . However , patient often similar biological sign despite implementation strict algorithm regard diagnostic procedure , appear large number patient test mutation ferroportin gene , mutation find case . It therefore essential optimize diagnosis process introduce additional criterion . The investigator ' hypothesis , base known element , response single dose iron modulate differently iron parameter measure serum , include hepcidin level control iron metabolism metal associate iron . This could helpful diagnosis procedure patient ferroportin disease dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Modulation Serum Hepcidin Level Response Iron Oral Intake : Potential Interest Differential Diagnosis Between Ferroportin Disease Dysmetabolic Hepatosiderosis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The quantification serum hepcidin level potential method investigation iron metabolism disorder . However , apart extreme situation , assay achieve solely helpful . This due varying level encounter one subject another disease . This related fact value consider normal cover wide range value obtain give patient give time , influence many factor . It report single oral iron dose induced increase serum hepcidin level healthy subject abolish subject genetic hemochromatosis link insufficient hepcidin expression relate mutation HFE TFR2 gene . In patient dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis , suggest expect hepcidinemia increase find iron intake alter , likely due slight inflammatory signal responsible hepcidin induction . The investigator hypothesize dynamic response iron parameter , include modulation hepcidin level , iron intake allow discriminate patient ferroportin disease dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis , situation whose clinicobiological presentation often confuse . Thus , three objective study : 1 . To define pharmacokinetic characteristic serum hepcidin response iron oral intake determine ability pharmacokinetic discriminate dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis ferroportin disease . 2 . To correlate amplitude response iron parameter modulation 3 . To correlate amplitude response concentration divalent cation whose metabolism use common gene involve iron metabolism .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria patient : Man woman older 18 year Subject liver iron overload great equal 100 umol /g dry liver weight , confirm MRI ( do perform body antenna complete deactivation surface antenna ) / biochemical assay liver biopsy , relate dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis ferroportin disease . The ferroportin disease retain patient present hyperferritinemia without elevate transferrin saturation heterozygote mutation gene encode ferroportin . A dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis retain follow usual diagnostic investigation include sequence gene ferroportin ( mutation proven negative ) , patient show cause iron overload hyperferritinemia relate excessive alcohol intake , nonmetabolic liver cytolysis ( hepatitis C virus , wilson , autoimmune hepatitis , ... ) , hemolysis , inflammatory syndrome . Status towards irondepletive treatment : either venesection perform ( Dysmetabolic HepatoSiderosis Ferroportin disease group ) attack iron depletive treatment complete ( Treated Dysmetabolic Hepatosiderosis Treated Ferroportin Disease group ) ferritin level le 100 ng / ml , without anemia venesection two last month .
