	<criteria>Adults ( age ≥ 18 year ) Histologically confirm diagnosis nonHodgkin Hodgkin lymphoma progress spite prior treatment , additional effective standard therapy available Patients may either measurable nonmeasurable disease , case eligible patient must disease clinically evaluated improvement progression Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 Adequate hematological , renal , hepatic , coagulation laboratory assessment Written inform consent participate study performance studyrelated procedure A primary lymphoma central nervous system ( CNS ) know lymphomatous involvement CNS . CNS image cerebrospinal fluid sample mandatory absence clinical suspicion lymphomatous involvement CNS . Current infection HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C. Patients serologic test perform screen HIV Hepatitis B C. Any serologic result suggestive ongoing viral infection investigate necessary clarify patient 's status . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption CPI0610 , include unresolved nausea , vomit , diarrhea CTCAE grade &gt; 1 . Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include follow : Acute myocardial infarction angina pectoris ≤ 6 month prior start study drug Serum cardiac troponin ( cTn ) level ≥ 99 % percentile upper reference limit QTcF &gt; 470 msec screen ECG Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 40 % Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ( patient ratecontrolled atrial fibrillation exclude . ) Any concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition could compromise participation study ( e.g. , clinically significant pulmonary disease , clinically significant neurological disorder , active uncontrolled infection ) Systemic anticancer treatment radiotherapy le 2 week first dose CPI0610 Radioimmunotherapy ( e.g. , 131Itositumomab , 90Yibritumomab tiuxetan ) less 6 week first dose CPI0610 Treatment investigational small molecule le 2 week first dose CPI0610 . In addition , first dose CPI0610 occur period equal great 5 halflives small molecule investigational agent elapse . Treatment therapeutic antibody le 4 week first dose CPI0610 . A minimum 2week period last treatment therapeutic antibody first dose CPI0610 may permit patient rapidly progressive aggressive subtypes lymphoma follow discussion medical monitor .
