	<brief_summary>1 . Summary Growing evidence suggest significant proportion in-hospital patient death occur serious adverse event ( SAE 's ) . Concerns raise often patient ' acute deterioration , particularly surgical medical ward outside critical care setting , identify late corrective action take slowly . Many initiative take prevent unexpected death timely recognition , intervention resuscitation effort Rapid Response Systems ( RRS 's ) . RRS 's introduced intention prevent SAE 's improve patient outcome facilitate early detection warn sign clinical deterioration . These system four component ( 1 ) afferent limb detection response triggering , ( 2 ) efferent limb medical nursing response prevent deterioration ( 3 ) process improvement limb ( 4 ) governance administrative structure . It remain uncertain element RRS 's contribute patient outcome unplanned ( re- ) admission intensive care unit , shock , cardiac arrest unexpected death . In addition , previous study find nurse observation , assessment communication ( afferent limb ) crucial achieve well patient outcome , achieve afferent limb sustainability hospital clear . A previous study investigate 23 hospital Flanders ( Belgium ) nurse observe , ass , detect communicate deteriorate critical patient surgical , medical geriatric ward . Wide variation hospital identify critical patient intervention procedure , strategy Do Not Attempt Resuscitation ( DNAR ) order well nurse use knowledge critical vital sign call criterion physician clinical advice support . Nurses hospital structure observation communication protocol well inform perceived communication collaboration physicians favorable compare hospital . Based result conclusion recommendation initiative formulate . The propose Afferent Limb Response Method intervention study implement recommendation guide robust scientific research approach offer evidence nursing medical practice community . The aim study evaluate effect Afferent Limb Ascertainment Response Method intervention ALARM intervention medical surgical nursing ward acute care hospital prevention SAE 's in-hospital unexpected death , unplanned ICU-admission cardiac arrest . 2 . Study hypothesis Optimizing support process observation , use interpretation vital sign , detection , assessment , escalation communication high level care deteriorate patient prevent serious adverse event ( in-hospital unexpected death , unplanned ICU admission cardiac arrest ) acute care hospital .</brief_summary>
