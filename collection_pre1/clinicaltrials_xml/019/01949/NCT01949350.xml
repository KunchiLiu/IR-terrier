	<brief_summary>Major non-cardiac surgery high degree morbidity mortality . Recently , measurement patient 's preoperative cardiorespiratory reserve , perform non-invasively cardiopulmonary exercise testing , show predictive outcome follow non-cardiac surgery . All patient prior major surgery starve minimum 6 hour often longer prior major elective surgery . It show elite athlete hypohydrated reduced exercise capacity lower cardiorespiratory function . These result exaggerate `` non-trained '' individual . Therefore , starvation policy prior surgery may deleterious effect outcome surgery . 4.2 AIMS This pilot study health volunteer assess role carbohydrate ( CHO ) ( preload ) carbohydrate-protein ( CHO-P ) ( Highfive energy source 1 4 ) improve aerobic capacity period fast mimic current starvation policy prior surgery . Both similar calorific value differ amount carbohydrate protein supplementation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2 OUTLINE OF STUDY METHODOLOGY ( See Appendix D ) The methodology test outline : - STARVATION POLICY The three exercise test undertake three separate day time morning minimise starvation time ensure consistency . All patient ask partake strenuous exercise 24 hour prior test could affect hydration performance status . Starvation exercise test Participants ask starve midnight prior test . They may small glass water 6am day test . This line current starvation policy Freeman Hospital . CHO load test Participants ask drink isotonic carbohydrate load drink ( preload ) appendix E night test also two hour prior CPX test . This type clear drink show emptied stomach within 2 hour administer safely day surgery . They ask starve midnight prior test . CHO-P load test Participants ask drink isotonic carbohydrate drink ( Highfive energy source 4:1 ) night prior test also two hour prior CPX test . Again , show type drink empty stomach rapidly . They ask starve midnight test CARDIOPULMONARY EXERCISE TESTING Cardiopulmonary exercise measurement conduct consistent environment preassessment clinic Clinic H , Freeman Hospital . CPX equipment include electronically brake cycle ergonometer , 12 lead ECG metabolic cart . The ECG allow online monitor lead rate rhythm , measure change S-T segment depression/elevation suggestive cardiac ischaemia . The metabolic cart oxygen carbon dioxide analysers response time enable breath-by-breath measurement . Calibration ensure test . VO2 , VCO2 , heart rate , minute ventilation , work rate display continuously throughout test . Setting CPX test Patients ECG lead apply get bike , coach mouthpiece communication test . They instruct give 'best effort ' stop feel dizzy faint . The increment work rate predetermine use equation estimate expect work capacity , aim test duration approximately 6-10 minute . CPX Test protocol Initially , 2 - 5 minute rest data perform , ensure patient comfort , Respiratory Exchange Ratio ( RER ) fall 1 , indication patient hyperventilate . Next , 1-3 minute unload cycling , follow graded increase incremental workload . The leg speed throughout test maintain 50-60 rpm ensure constant effort . The patient give verbal feedback encouragement throughout test . The test stop patient due fatigue , pain , light headedness , fail maintain great 30 rpm one minute despite encouragement . On completion exercise phase test , patient monitor recovery period heart rate reach within 10 % pre-test , ST segment normalise applicable . Exercise data processing Results present standard nine-panel format compile CPX software . Further analysis sub maximal parameter related cardiopulmonary reserve undertaken train personnel</detailed_description>
