	<brief_title>Enzalutamide With Without Abiraterone Prednisone Treating Patients With Castration-Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomize one two treatment group : enzalutamide enzalutamide , abiraterone prednisone . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow clinical outcome maximum 5 year post study treatment . The primary secondary objective describe . 1 . Primary Objective : To compare overall survival patient progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) treat either enzalutamide enzalutamide abiraterone prednisone 2 . Secondary Objectives : - To assess grade 3 high toxicity profile compare safety treatment arm . - To assess compare post-treatment prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) decline treatment arm . - To compare radiographic progression free survival define Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) , objective response rate , treatment arm . - To test radiographic progression free survival ( rPFS ) treatment interaction predict overall survival . - To assess pre- post-treatment measure tumor burden bone activity use sodium fluoride ( NaF ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) technetium ( Tc ) methylene diphosphonate ( MDP ) bone scintigraphy correlate measure overall survival . - To develop validate prognostic predictive model overall survival include baseline clinical molecular marker .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria : 1 . Documentation Disease Progressive castrationresistant metastatic prostate cancer histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation small cell feature 2 . Patients must measurable nonmeasurable disease : 1 . Measurable Disease For visceral extra nodal lesion consider measurable , must ≥ 10 mm one dimension , use spiral CT. For lymph node consider measurable ( ie , target evaluable lesion ) , must ≥ 20 mm least one dimension , use spiral CT. 2 . NonMeasurable Disease All lesion , include small lesion ( long diameter &lt; 20 mm conventional technique &lt; 10 mm spiral CT scan ) truly nonmeasurable lesion . Lesions consider nonmeasurable include bone lesion ( ) . 3 . Patients node disease ( ie , presence visceral , extra nodal lesion bone lesion ) must node ( ) measure ≥ 15 mm short axis . 3 . Progressive Disease Patients must progressive disease study entry define one follow three criterion occur patient androgen deprivation therapy . For patient enrol basis soft tissue bone progression , baseline scan must show progression relative comparison scan . If comparison scan available , baseline scan report must reference previous scan document progression . 1 . PSA progression define minimum two rise PSA level interval ≥ 1 week determination . Patients receive antiandrogen must progression document minimum two rise PSA level interval ≥ 1 week determination least second rise ≥ 4 week since last flutamide , bicalutamide nilutamide . The PSA value screen ≥ 2 µg/L ( 2 ng/mL ) . 2 . Soft tissue disease progression define protocol 3 . Bone disease progression define Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) two new lesion bone scan 4 . Prior Treatment 1 . No treatment prior taxanebased chemotherapy metastatic disease Patients receive prior taxanebased chemotherapy neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy local disease , receive taxanebased therapy PSA clinical ( nonmetastatic ) state allowable provide total duration exposure six cycle less chemotherapy complete 6 month prior registration Taxanebased chemotherapy abort due allergic reaction intolerance chemotherapy therefore receive one cycle prior therapy allowable 2 . No prior enzalutamide , abiraterone novel antiandrogen androgen synthesis inhibitor 3 . No treatment follow prostate cancer within 4 week prior enrollment : Hormonal therapy ( e.g. , androgen receptor [ AR ] antagonist , 5 alpha reductase inhibitor , estrogen ) Note : Treatment bicalutamide nilutamide within 4 week prior enrollment allow . Treatment flutamide within 4 week prior enrollment allow . Treatment gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) analogues antagonist allow . Chemotherapy Biologic therapy Investigational therapy Immunotherapy 4 . No use herbal product may decrease PSA level within 4 week prior enrollment 5 . No use systemic steroid great equivalent 10 mg prednisone/prednisolone per day within 4 week prior enrollment 6 . No prior use ketoconazole great 7 day 7 . No prior radiation therapy radionuclide therapy treatment metastasis within four week prior enrollment 8 . Patients receive bisphosphonate therapy denosumab must stable dose least 4 week prior enrollment 9 . Patients must maintain ongoing androgen deprivation therapy GnRH analogue , antagonist , bilateral orchiectomy ( i.e. , surgical medical castration ) 5 . Patient History 1 . No know suspect brain metastasis ( NOTE : patient treat epidural disease allow ) 2 . No planned palliative procedure alleviation bone pain radiation therapy surgery 3 . No structurally unstable bone lesion suggest impending fracture 4 . No history seizure condition may increase patient 's seizure risk ( e.g. , prior cortical stroke , significant brain trauma ) . No history transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within 12 month enrollment 5 . No clinically significant cardiovascular disease include : Myocardial infarction ( MI ) within 6 month Uncontrolled angina within 3 month Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 , patient NYHA class 3 4 past , unless screen echocardiogram ( echo ) multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) perform within three month demonstrate ejection fraction ( EF ) &gt; 45 % History clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( e.g. , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , torsades de pointes ) History Mobitz II second degree third degree heart block without permanent pacemaker place Hypotension ( systolic blood pressure [ BP ] &lt; 86 mmHg ) bradycardia ( &lt; 50 bpm ) screening Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic BP &gt; 170 mmHg diastolic BP &gt; 105 mmHg screen ) 6 . No gastrointestinal ( GI ) disorder negatively affect absorption 7 . No major surgery within 4 week prior enrollment 6 . Age performance status 1 . Age ≥ 18 year age 2 .
