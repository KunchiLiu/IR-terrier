	<brief_title>24hr Imaging Of HCC After EOVIST</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before research start ( screen ) : After sign consent form , participant ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn participant take part research study . If participant test procedure recently , may may repeat . - A medical history , include question participant 's health , current medication , allergy . - An assessment tumor X-ray , CT ( Computerized Tomography ) scan , MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scan . If test show participant eligible participate research study , participant begin study . If participant meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . After screen procedure confirm participant eligible participate research study : In research study , investigator look see MR image Eovist perform 24 hour injection Eovist help improve identification characterization focal liver tumor . Currently , standard Eovist-enhanced MRI examination include image 20 minute injection Eovist . The participant undergo routine , standard care Eovist MRI examination liver . The participant ask return follow day repeat MRI examination may perform approximately 24 hour dose Eovist . No additional injection perform 2nd day image . Planned Follow-up : The investigator follow participant completion 24 hour MRI examination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must histologically cytologically confirm hepatocellular carcinoma OR imaging study demonstrate focal hepatic lesion image feature diagnostic hepatocellular carcinoma . Participants must schedule undergo Eovistenhanced MRI liver part standard care . Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm MRI . Because dose adverse event data currently available use Eovist participant &lt; 18 year age , HCC exceedingly rare pediatric population , child exclude study . The effect Eovist develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Participants chemotherapy , radiofrequency ablation , microwave ablation , chemoembolization , radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Eovist . Patients glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 . Patients unable undergo MRI imaging . Patients pregnant .</criteria>
