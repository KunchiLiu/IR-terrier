	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate ability compound [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 , use tracer PET ( positron emission tomography ) imaging , detect region unstable atherosclerotic plaque carotid artery subject consider carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) , confirm ability histological study sample carotid artery plaque collect plan carotid surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TRACER RGD-K5 Carotid Plaque Imaging Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients choose study base presence carotid artery stenosis ascertain CTA carotid artery ultrasound . Patients receive intravenous injection radiolabeled PET tracer , [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 , undergo PET image carotid artery bilaterally . PET image analyze determine standard uptake value ( SUV ) [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 uptake carotid artery plaque compare SUV background ( blood pool aorta ) . This express target background ratio ( TBR ) . Investigators expect find significant uptake [ F-18 ] RGD-K5 carotid artery palque investigator therefore expect find TBR significantly &gt; 1 . Investigators also expect find plaque patient show TBR &gt; 1 also enrich histologic marker inflammation angiogenesis .</detailed_description>
