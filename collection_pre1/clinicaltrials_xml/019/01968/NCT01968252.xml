	<brief_title>Speckle-tracking Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Use speckle-tracking echocardiography validate tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion measurement transesophageal echocardiography . 2 . This study intend validate use speckle-tracking echocardiography measure distance tricuspid annulus move systolic phase . The guideline article regard right ventricular function suggest m-mode measurement transthoracic approach measurement may underestimate actual distance transesophageal echocardiography . This speckle-tracking technology allow distance measure despite often non-parallel motion ultrasound beam , otherwise limit reliability valve record . 3 . All subject undergo planned surgical procedure use transesophageal echocardiography would use regardless management . 4 . No intervention , evaluation measurement obtain transthoracic echocardiography compare transesophageal echocardiography . 5 . No follow-up , study complete time image acquisition .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All subject schedule undergo general anesthesia concurrently manage intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography include potential subject . Subjects adequate transesophageal and/or transthoracic image window allow accurate analysis tricuspid annular motion .</criteria>
