	<brief_summary>Oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) program milk , egg peanut , desensitize patient respective allergen thereby decrease risk morbidity mortality . OIT program , however , without adverse event , particularly highly sensitive patient . Recently , demonstrate administration bake milk ( BM ) product IgE-CMA patient non-reactive BM , promote tolerance unheated milk ( UM ) . The goal research determine whether BM promote desensitization even highly sensitive patient , react bake milk well . In second step , hypothesize BM-OIT promote desensitization unheated milk , well . Importance : The change risk/benefit ratio program alter therapeutic approach IgE-CMP allergic patient . Probable implication Medicine : BM-OIT allow highly sensitive patient tolerate milk product , decrease risk life-threatening reaction . Furthermore , analysis immune modulation parameter change treatment program , pave way define mechanism underlie tolerance CMP allergy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Baked Milk Oral Immunotherapy Severe IgE-mediated Cow 's Milk Protein Allergic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first aim , test four day induction ( escalate ) program , whether highly sensitive UM-reactive patient ) tolerate BM . Those successful randomize treated BM-OIT group ( group A ) observational control group ( group B ) . In second aim , fraction patient Group A successfully progress BM-OIT ( tolerate ≥ 360 mg BM ) 6 month period determine compare fraction patient Group B tolerate 360mg . The result also compare progression highly sensitive IgE-CMA patient UM-OIT ( Group C , reactive ≤21 mg UM ) . In aim-3 , fraction BM-OIT patient able tolerate minimally ≥ 12.5 mg UM high initially elicit dose . assess . Methods : Severe patient ( &gt; 4 year ) positive clinical history , SPT positive DBPCFC CMP first test ability tolerate BM . The treatment group undergo three round oral induction , consist 4 day perform every 4 week . On day # 1 , patient rapidly desensitize threshold . On day 2-3 , maximum tolerable dose interval determine . Day # 4 mimic home treatment . Home treatment continue next induction . After 6 month treatment patient evaluate reactivity UM .</detailed_description>
