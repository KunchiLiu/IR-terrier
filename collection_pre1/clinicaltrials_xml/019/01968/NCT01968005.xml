Subject Current Pain Intensity Subjects LBP potentially associate specific spinal cause ( e.g . know highgrade spondylolisthesis [ Grade 3 4 ] , tumour , infection , vertebral compression fracture [ history ≤1 year ] , Paget 's disease , osteoporosis , spinal stenosis ) . Any past lowback surgery , schedule low back surgery trial , schedule surgery painful procedure course trial , opinion investigator , may affect efficacy safety assessment . Invasive procedure ( e.g . epidural injection , spinal cord stimulation therapy ) within past six month aim reduce LBP . Clinically relevant history hypersensitivity , allergy contraindication IPs ' excipients , aspirinlike drug Presence condition LBP investigator 's opinion could confound assessment selfevaluation pain , limited anatomical deformity , significant skin condition infection ( abscesses ulcer ) , unilateral bilateral low limb pain independent indication LBP , painful venous insufficiency , painful post thrombotic syndrome , painful osteoarthritis knee , distal low limb inflammation , diffuse widespread pain fibromyalgia .
