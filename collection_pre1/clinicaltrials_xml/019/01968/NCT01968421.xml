	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis still common chronic respiratory disease . Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis characterize irreversible dilatation medium-sized bronchus result airway injury due recurrent chronic inflammation infection . Clinical feature bronchiectasis include chronic production sputum often mucopurulent purulent nature , persistent bacterial colonization , recurrent low respiratory tract infection . Bronchiectasis airways often colonize bacterial specie . Infections airway think play important role bronchiectasis exacerbation . Progressive lung damage bronchiectasis result 'vicious cycle ' recurrent bacterial infection deregulate inflammatory response . The non-specific prevention recurrent airway infection immunostimulating agent gain grow scientific interest . OM-85 , consist extract eight kind bacteria important respiratory infection , know support respiratory tract resistance pathogen via activate pulmonary macrophage , increase ratio CD4 CD8 lymphocytes , change level variety cytokine lung . OM-85 show benefit significantly reduce incidence exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Bronchiectasis exacerbation contribute substantially rapid decline lung function , reduce quality life , medical cost . The purpose study investigate PReventive effect OM-85 Bronchiectasis Exacerbation Chinese patient ( iPROBE ) . This study design prospective randomise double-blind placebo-controlled multi-centred trial . A total 244 patient bronchiectasis , least one exacerbation bronchiectasis previous year , include . The subject randomly receive two course 7mg OM-85 match placebo take one oral capsule per day 10 day month 3 consecutive month begin study , 3 month later schedule 1 year . We investigate whether long-term therapy oral immunostimulant OM-85 decrease exacerbation patient bronchiectasis 1-year period . Besides , ass outcome include : rate event-based exacerbation , lung function parameter , total score St George 's respiratory questionnaire coughing , inflammatory index . We hope study provide novel information preventive effect OM-85 treatment bronchiectasis exacerbation address knowledge gap poorly understood under-studied disease .</detailed_description>
