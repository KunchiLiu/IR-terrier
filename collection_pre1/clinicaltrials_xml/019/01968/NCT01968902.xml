	<brief_title>Safety Xeomin Lower Limb Spasticity Multiple Sclerosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Design : Thirty patient MS , male female , age 18-70 , either relapse progressive type , evaluate prospective treatment trial compare gait injection Xeomin . Patient Population : The patient include functionally significant equinovarus spasticity primarily one low extremity ; functionally significant spasticity define spasticity impair gait observation 25 foot walk , cause fall , lead secondary orthopedic complication genu recurvatum pain low back hip . The patient ambulatory , stable disease . Dose Selection : A dose 200 unit 400 unit Xeomin injected EMG-guided technique appropriate muscle effect leg . These muscle may include gastrocnemius soleus , tibialis posterior muscle determine examiner . The dose administer determine blind injector base determination muscle bulk degree spasticity Blinding : Investigators blind medication use throughout study . Site randomize subject 1:1 fashion use unblinded site delegate . Compliance Laws Regulations : This study conduct accordance U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulation , International Conference Harmonisation ( ICH ) E6 Guideline Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) , applicable local , state , federal law . Study Assessments : After inform consent obtain screening measurement complete , patient return 4 week injection primary secondary efficacy evaluation . Additional evaluation 6 12 week make order determine duration effect Xeomin secondary efficacy evaluation . Concomitant therapy include prescription counter preparation take patient time screen last study visit . All concomitant medication report investigator record . Patients enrol study permit take medication exception follow - Methylprednisolone within 30 day prior screen - Injection botulinum toxin within past 6 month ( 180days ) During study patient permit receive treatment deem necessary investigator management disease . However patient require commencement exclude therapy discontinue study data use statistical purpose . Study Assessments : Patients must sign informed consent form screen evaluation measurement perform . Patients must satisfy inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion randomize . Information regard consent patient subsequently randomize keep regulatory binder . SAFETY MEASURES Safety assessment consist monitor record adverse event ( AE 's ) serious adverse event ( SAE 's ) . All SAE 's report FDA Med Watch within 48 business hr site notification SAE . For protocol serious SAE define AE meet follow criterion : - Fatal ( i.e . AE actually cause lead death ) - Life threatening ( i.e . AE view investigator , place patient immediate risk death ) - Requires prolongs hospitalization - Results persistent significant disability/incapacity ( i.e . AE result substantial disruption patient ability conduct normal life function ) - A congenital anomaly/birth defect neonate/infant bear mother expose investigational product - Considered significant medical event investigator ( e.g , may jeopardize patient may require medical/surgical intervention prevent one outcomes list ) The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Med Watch Reporting system Health Professionals STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE A detailed description statistical methodology provide statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) may deviate analysis outline protocol ; however , substantial deviation protocol detailed protocol amendment . Description Endpoints - Primary Endpoint Mean change injection visit week 6 Modified Ashworth score Xeomin v placebo group - Secondary Endpoints - Mean change injection visit week 6 Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale ( MSIS-29 ) Physical psychological score Xeomin vs placebo group - Mean change injection visit week 6 T25FW Xeomin v Placebo group . - Patient global impression change ( PGIC ) Xeomin v placebo group - Clinical Global Impression change Xeomin v placebo group - Mean change injection visit week 6 Likert pain scale Xeomin v placebo group - Mean change injection visit week 6 MSWS-12 Xeomin v placebo group . Demography Baseline Disease Characteristics - Demographic baseline characteristic present descriptively ( i.e. , mean , standard deviation , median , range ) analyze appropriate statistical method give distribution type data . Efficacy - Analysis Population The Intent-to-Treat population define subject receive least 1 dose study treatment provide efficacy assessment . - General Methods Analysis Descriptive statistic provide efficacy endpoint . A two-sided test , p-value confidence interval present analysis general . - Primary Endpoint Analysis The primary endpoint mean change injection visit week 6 Modified Ashworth score . A two sample T-test use compare treatment difference Xeomin placebo group . If data normally distribute , Wilcoxon 's rank sum test use analysis . - Secondary Endpoints Analysis Percent change injection visit week 6 calculate primary endpoint . It analyze similarly primary endpoint . For secondary endpoint MSIS 29 , T25FW , Likert pain scale MSWS-12 similar statistical approach outline primary endpoint use assess mean change injection visit week 6 scale treatment group . Patient global impression change ( PGIC ) clinical global Impression change analyze use Wilcoxon 's rank sum test . Safety - Analysis Population The safety population define subject receive least 1 dose study treatment . Adverse event list . Serious AE list well . Sample Size Considerations Based observational study , patient use Xeomin improvement 50 % Ashworth scale . A sample size 15 patient per group provide 80 % power detect treatment difference 50 % 0.05 two-sided significance level use chi-square test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient clinically definite MS , either RRMS progressive form ( SPMS , PPSM , PRMS ) Ages 1865 year . Patients must stable state , clinical relapse methylprednisolone treatment last 30 day , slowly progressive MS , EDSS score 2.06.5 . Patients must functionally significant spasticity predominantly one low extremity determine score &gt; 2 Modified Ashworth Scale screen Unstable medical neurological disease Known sensitivity Xeomin Prior injection botulinum toxin within 6 month EDSS score 7.0 great Exacerbation MS within past 30 day Significant cognitive impairment psychiatric disease Advanced arthritis cause clinically significant limitation passive range motion around joint assess study . Concomitant neurologic condition cause spasticity rigidity . Has major surgery within 3 month prior Screening visit may affect spasticity assessment back , low leg knee surgery . Use medication could influence muscle tone antispasticity medication must stable &gt; 90 day prior screen visit must remain stable throughout study period .</criteria>
