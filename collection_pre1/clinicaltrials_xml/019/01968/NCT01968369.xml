	<brief_summary>Several epidemiological intervention study suggest high dietary intake tomato associate low risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , , low intake associate increase incidence CVD . This beneficial effect attribute especially lycopene , antioxidant present high concentration within tomato substance could importance . Endothelial dysfunction early marker atherosclerosis lead CVD . The aim present study therefore investigate whether consumption tomato product ameliorate peripheral endothelial function , trigger high fat meal , human volunteer randomise , crossover dietary intervention study . Study design : Investigators randomise healthy men ( N=14-28 ) consume high fat meal either without tomato sauce ( 80 gr ) cross-over design 7 day wash-out period . During week study subject maintain low fiber diet subject randomize tomato receive daily dose 80 mg tomato sauce ( 80 gr 7 days= total load 560 mg ) . We hypothesize tomato sauce improve deleterious effect high fat meal vascular function .</brief_summary>
