	<brief_summary>Progressive renal impairment chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) may cause inability excrete phosphate load , thus lead typical abnormality mineral metabolism , increased phosphate reduce calcium level , 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D deficiency secondary hyperparathyroidism ( HPT ) . Treatment vitamin D analogue and/or phosphate binder ameliorate abnormality also associate accelerated renal disease progression increase cardiovascular risk . However post-hoc analysis 331 patient proteinuric chronic nephropathy include Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy ( REIN ) trial , increase serum phosphate level inclusion , even within normal reference range , associate incremental risk progression End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) . Moreover , increase level serum phosphate associate progressively decrease protective effect ramipril therapy progression ESRD , point benefit Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme ( ACE ) inhibition almost fully lose among patient serum phosphate level exceed 4.5 mg/dL . This finding provide convincing evidence phosphate play direct pathogenic role patient progressive nephropathy excess phosphate exposure may limit even blunt renoprotective effect ACE inhibitor therapy population . Sevelamer carbonate newly approve phosphate binder chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient yet maintenance dialysis . Treatment Sevelamer , addition correct hyperphosphatemia , also find ameliorate abnormality mineral metabolism associate accelerated renal disease progression increase cardiovascular risk . Moreover , Sevelamer therapy reduces proteinuria animal model uremia , effect long term might translate significant renoprotection . These finding suggest serum phosphate might specific target renoprotective therapy CKD patient provide background randomized clinical trial formally test whether reduce phosphate exposure phosphate bind agent may serve optimize renoprotective effect RAS inhibition population . Thus , whether phosphate reduction Sevelamer carbonate therapy may specific antiproteinuric effect human chronic nephropathy residual proteinuria despite optimized RAS inhibitor therapy worth investigate .</brief_summary>
