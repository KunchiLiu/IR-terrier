	<brief_summary>The kidney important regulator blood pressure . Previous research show disrupting nerve ( denervate ) kidney may successfully decrease blood pressure . In past , one technique use treat severe high blood pressure surgical procedure cut nerve . However , surgery longer commonly perform . Another approach disrupt nerve use Beta-Cath 3.5F system deliver small amount radiation treatment zone . The Beta-Cath 3.5F System ( Novoste ) currently approve United States deliver ion dose therapy re-narrowings form coronary artery heart . This trial assess safety treat patient Beta-Cath 3.5F System ( Novoste ) denervate nerve around kidney help control blood pressure patient uncontrolled hypertension . 1 . Renal artery brachytherapy beta-emitting source safe . 2 . Renal artery brachytherapy beta-emitting source reduce systolic/diastolic blood pressure via renal denervation mechanism within 6 month post treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>4.2.1 GENERAL INCLUSION CRITERIA Subjects must meet follow inclusion criterion prior enrollment trial : 1 . Individual ≥ 18 ≤ 85 year age . 2 . Individual systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 160 mmHg ( ≥ 150 mmHg type 2 diabetic ) base average 3 office blood pressure reading . 3 . Individual adhere stable ( maximally tolerate dose ) drug regimen include 3 antihypertensive medication least 1 month ( include one diuretic ) expect maintain least 6 month . 4 . Individual competent willing provide inform consent participate trial . 4.2.2 ANGIOGRAPHIC INCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Individual main renal artery measure &lt; 2.75 mm diameter . 1 . Inability sign write informed consent . 2 . Individual renal artery anatomy ineligible treatment include : 1 . Main renal artery &lt; 20 mm treatable length 2 . Renal artery stenosis ≥20 % angiography . 3 . A history prior renal artery intervention include balloon angioplasty stenting . 4 . Multiple main renal artery either kidney . 3 . Individual eGFR &lt; 45mL/min/1.73m2 , use MDRD formula calculation . 4 . Individual &gt; 1 hospital admission hypertensive crisis within past year . 5 . Individual Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring 24 hour average SBP &lt; 135mmHg . 6 . Individual &gt; 1 episode ( ) orthostatic hypotension ( reduction SBP &gt; 20 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; 10 mmHg within 3 minute stand ) couple symptom within past year screening process . 7 . Individual require chronic oxygen support mechanical ventilation nocturnal respiratory support sleep apnea . 8 . Individual primary pulmonary hypertension . 9 . Individual schedule plan surgery cardiovascular intervention next 3 month . 10 . Individual condition would prohibit interfere ability obtain accurate blood pressure measurement use protocolspecified automatic blood pressure monitor ( e.g. , arm diameter large cuff , arrhythmia interferes automatic monitor 's pulse sense prohibits accurate measurement ) . 11 . Individual pregnant , nurse planning pregnant . 12 . Individual hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease reduction blood pressure would consider hazardous . 13 . Individual serious medical condition , opinion investigator , may adversely affect safety and/or effectiveness participant study ( i.e. , patient clinically significant peripheral vascular disease , abdominal aortic aneurysm , bleed disorder thrombocytopenia , hemophilia , significant anemia , arrhythmias atrial fibrillation ) . 14 . Individual known , unresolved history drug use alcohol dependency , lack ability comprehend follow instruction , would unlikely unable comply study followup requirement . 15 . Individual currently enrol another investigational drug device trial .</criteria>
