	<brief_summary>In cancerology , anemia frequently-found situation , prevalence range 30 % 90 % , accord series , disease stage , primary tumor location age ( Scotte , Launay-Vacher et al . 2012 ) . Although probably major cause anemia , iron deficiency ( ID ) seldom investigated field cancer . Its prevalence incidence never assess prospective study . It well-known anemia cancer set source asthenia deterioration quality life , even reduce efficacy anticancer treatment radiotherapy . Correcting anemia therefore constitute daily challenge . Before 2004-2005 , large proportion patient treat erythropoietin ( EPO ) . However , prescription EPO appear considerably decline since warning issue various scientific society government account possible increase death rate higher incidence thromboembolic event , report 8 study publish date ( NCCN 2012 ) . Simultaneously , transfusion rate augment 3.4 % 8.7 % median hemoglobin level fell 10.8 8.9 g/dL ( Feinberg , Bruno et al . 2012 ) . The use injectable iron appear improved correction anemia EPO , report several concordant study versus oral iron placebo ( Pedrazzoli , Rosti et al . 2009 ; Steensma , Sloan et al . 2011 ) . However , monotherapy study conduct evaluate impact injectable iron , alone without EPO , correction ID ( without anemia ) cancer treatment . Consequently , exist wide variety practice , injectable iron prescription rate , priori , match number patient iron deficiency . There exist iron-based parameter characterize ID yet use routinely chemotherapy need validate cancer field . These parameter include : - An assay reticulocyte hemoglobin content ( rHC ) - An assay soluble transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) Soluble transferrin receptor mainly locate red blood line cell receive iron deliver transferrin . In study , propose make prospective assessment iron status cancer patient begin chemotherapy . The aim determine proportion patient might benefit injectable iron treatment . All ID cover prospectively 2-year period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Predictable risk The study involve increase risk additional discomfort . Blood sample use study take blood sampling schedule hospital practice reference institution . Only small amount blood take study repercussion patient 's general status . Evaluation expect result Improved knowledge ID epidemiology patient receive chemotherapy would enable effective target potential patient specifically require management injectable iron . Expected benefit Through medium study : - We hope optimize ID screening , increase knowledge ID characteristic enhance patient management . - Management anemia cancer set could thus modify , i.e . via injectable iron treatment involve EPO , danger ( increase number thromboembolic event , even potentially negative impact survival ) fully document . - Patients include study benefit detection ID , otherwise would discover .</detailed_description>
