	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Single Dose Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) Vaccine RSV-Seronegative Infants Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RSV common viral cause serious acute lower respiratory illness ( LRI ) infants child 5 year age around world . RSV illness range mild upper respiratory tract illness ( URI ) severe LRI , include bronchiolitis pneumonia . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity RSV vaccine healthy RSV-naïve child . At study entry , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , blood collection , nasal wash . Participants randomly assign receive RSV vaccine placebo 2:1 ratio , administer nose drop . Participants actively monitor 28 day follow administration vaccine placebo ; monitor include medical history review , clinical assessment , visit , nasal wash . On day study visit schedule , study researcher contact participant ' parent guardian medical follow-up . At study visit Day 56 , participant undergo medical history review , blood collection , nasal wash procedure . From November March follow participant 's study participation , parent guardian report respiratory and/or febrile illness weekly basis via telephone call study researcher . Participants may additional study visit may include blood collection and/or nasal wash procedure follow-up period . This protocol companion study CIR 285 ; study conduct Center Immunization Research ( CIR , Johns Hopkins , Baltimore ) , Laboratory Infectious Diseases ( NIAID , Bethesda ) . The protocols identical primary secondary objective ; immunization schedule ; evaluation assay schedule ; safety monitoring reporting . The protocol vary slightly site selection requirement , eligibility requirement site monitoring .
