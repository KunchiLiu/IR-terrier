	<brief_summary>Despite plethora literature suggest regional blockade provide adequate andimproved postoperative pain control , function improve intraoperative postoperative safety proximal upper extremity surgery , little known benefit treatment forearm distal radius fracture . The purpose randomize , prospective , study determine brachial plexus blockade general anesthesia superior general anesthesia alone immediate long-term pain control patient undergo operative fixation distal upper extremity fracture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brachial Plexus Block Post-Op Pain Control After Distal Upper Extremity Fracture : A Prospective Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare two ( 2 ) different type anesthesia treatment use surgery broken arm post-surgery pain relief . One group receive general anesthesia ( state total unconsciousness ) group get sedation ( medicine inject patient 's vein help patient fall asleep ) , nerve block ( injection anesthetic drug nerve go patient 's arm order make patient 's arm numb ) . Both form anesthesia use variety surgery arm include shoulder elbow surgery . Currently think advantage disadvantage type . The advantage use nerve block addition general anesthesia ( current standard care ) decrease potential risk bleeding , infection nerve injury . Alternatively , advantage use nerve block sedation ( research-related procedure ) potentially offer good post-operative pain control . This study examine whether added benefit addition nerve block anesthesia decrease pain surgical treatment low arm fracture .</detailed_description>
