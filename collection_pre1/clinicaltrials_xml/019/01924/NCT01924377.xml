	<brief_summary>Recent clinical study show atrial fibrillation ( AF ) human might sustain localized source call `` mother rotor '' exhibit persistent , fast , well organize activity AF play important role generation maintenance fibrillatory activity . In study , investigator aim identify electrophysiological characteristic mother rotor atrial fibrillation patient paroxysmal persistent AF test whether ablation patient-specific substrate might improve acute long-term success conventional catheter ablation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present study design prospective , single-centre , randomize , single-blind , control , 2-arm parallel group trial . The study consist : ) two-month screening period ; ii ) randomization treatment phase ; iii ) follow-up phase last 24 month . Patients paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation refer centre undergo catheter ablation procedure screen . It expect approximately 260 patient screen order 234 patient fulfil inclusion criterion end screen period . The sample include 154 patient paroxysmal AF 80 patient persistent AF . Paroxysmal persistent AF define accord current ESC guideline . Patients fulfil selection criterion , inform study ask participation . The study requirement , include require testing , discuss subject . A sign Informed Consent Form study participation must obtain prior study-related procedure . Patients give daily diary record AF-related sign symptom instruct bring back inclusion visit . Eligible patient randomise use web-based randomization system embed electronic CRF ( e-CRF ) . A randomization schedule , stratify AF type , use balanced block establish start trial . Patients randomise one two ablation procedure : - standard circumferential pulmonary vein isolation ( CPVI ) - CPVI follow rotor ' identification ablation ( CPVI + Rotor . The acute endpoint AF ablation procedure electrical isolation pulmonary vein non inducibility AF atrial extrastimuli . Rotors define fast persistent electrical activation intracardiac electrograms regular cycle length shorter 240 m stable isoelectric line two adjacent activation . The acute endpoint rotor identification predefined map characteristic elimination radiofrequency ablation circumferential pulmonary vein isolation . Antiarrhythmic medication may continue first 3 month follow first ablation avoid early recurrence . At 3 month , antiarrhythmic must stop assess clinical recurrence . Freedom symptomatic AF , atrial tachycardia , atrial flutter antiarrhythmic drug therapy assess end 3 month blank period 12 month follow ablation procedure , document implantable loop recorder monitor trans-telephonic ( TT ) ECG monitoring . AF episodes &gt; 10 minute document implantable loop recorder registration daily trans-telephonic ( TT ) ECG record e-CRF , clearly identify date time occurrence . Total duration episode also record . In addition , presence symptom , report patient daily diary sought . A Clinical Events Committee ( CEC ) make three cardiologist arrhythmologists participant study review adjudicate , symptomatic asymptomatic AF recurrence . The Clinical Research Unit staff support Investigator Sponsor maintain high level ethical , scientific , technical regulatory quality aspect Clinical Trial . At regular interval Clinical Trial , Clinical Research Unit staff review study progress emergent problem . Random source data verification perform . Data collect mean electronic e-CRF , FDA 21 CFR part 11 compliant . A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan issue .</detailed_description>
