	<brief_title>Comparison Airway Intubation Devices When Using Biohazard Suit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study take place academic/training facility Lehigh Valley Health Network simulate intubation bio-terrorism attack . As part usual ( standard care ) residency education , study volunteer participate day-long airway train course Fall 2013 test device introduce resident able practice use variety training mannequin . As part training , enrol study subject time use three intubation device , without wear biohazard protective gear , total six measurement per resident . Residents assign chronological number arrive signed course . These number also use study identification number . Subjects randomize odd even identification number whether make initial attempt street clothe biohazard suit . This help control individual subject 's skill learning . The subject intubate mannequin use tested device . The order device use actual clinical practice : 1 ) Direct Laryngoscopy ( classic standard care ) , 2 ) GlideScope C-MAC video laryngoscope ( fiber-optic technology , become increasingly popular among emergency physician ) , 3 ) Supraglottic Airway Laryngopharyngeal Tube airway device ( inexpensive , convenient supraglottic device allow blind intubation technique device ) . Data collect , per device , time take tube use attempt . Demographic information also collect participant gender , resident year , prior intubation experience , prior exposure test device , experience wear biohazard suit . Study participant ' satisfaction device also record .</detailed_description>
