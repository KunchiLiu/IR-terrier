	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine single dose vitamin D administer orally fall provide adequate vitamin D healthy individual duration winter , vitamin D level know decrease . The investigator also interested find level vitamin D provide adequate level remainder year . While benefit once-yearly vitamin D administration clear patient osteoporosis , osteomalacia , rickets , condition associate vitamin D deficiency high bone turn-over , study perform high dos vitamin D use prevent seasonal decline vitamin D concentration healthy individual . These finding could provide evidence support vitamin D administration healthy individual wintertime improve health outcome , provide basis additional study healthy sick population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Wintertime Dose Vitamin D3 Prevent Winter Decline Vitamin D Status Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D , synthesize 7-dehydrocholesterol ultraviolet- B exposure , aid absorption calcium G.I . tract . Indirectly , maintain optimal calcium homeostasis , adequate vitamin D concentration essential skeletal health ( prevent rickets osteomalacia ) , cardiovascular health ( lower risk hypertension ) , ultimately decrease mortality . Due decrease direct sunlight exposure winter ( characterize limited outdoor activity , increase clothing coverage , angle sun ) , vitamin D concentration show decline individual winter . Once-yearly administration bolus vitamin D offer mean prevent seasonal decline vitamin D status prevent vitamin D deficiency . If prove successful , once-yearly dose vitamin D would provide improved compliance relative daily monthly dose provide inexpensive easy way ensure optimal concentration vitamin D year-round . This pilot study plan investigate year dose vitamin D winter month self-identified healthy adult effective maintain optimal vitamin D status entire year . In brief , study randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate efficacy 250,000 IU vitamin D3 compare placebo give 30 healthy individual ( 15 subject per arm ) November . The serum 25 ( OH ) D ( best measurable level vitamin D status ) measure 3-4 month 1 year determine efficacy dose relative 15 healthy control . The intent clinical investigation evaluate dietary supplement 's ability diagnose , cure , mitigate prevent disease . This study evaluate blood concentration regimen vitamin D. Ultimately , study hope determine single dose vitamin D administer orally fall provide adequate vitamin D healthy young individual 3 month winter , vitamin D level know decrease , entire year . These finding could provide evidence support vitamin D administration healthy individual wintertime improve health outcome , provide basis additional study healthy sick population . Secondary outcome study evaluate hypothesize effect vitamin D biomarkers affect health status immunity , include marker inflammation marker iron status .</detailed_description>
