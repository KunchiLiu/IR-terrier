	<brief_summary>This two-stage study test whether t-VNS use NEMOS device activate CAP reduce marker systemic inflammation . Stage A ( healthy volunteer ) stage B ( patient Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ) . Stage A : healthy human volunteer . A randomized , single blind , three-period crossover design compare CAP activation effect 10 minute ( active ) versus 60 minute ( active ) versus 10 minute ( sham ) stimulation NEMOS device . CAP activation assess reduction vitro release LPS-inducible cytokine whole blood . Analysis reduction whole blood cytokine release assay 10 versus 60 minute stimulation , kinetics nadir whole blood cytokine release assay inform selection dose duration sample time Stage B . Performing extensive exploration dose duration kinetics adult allow one dose , single optimal sample time JIA patient , thus minimize blood draw discomfort child . Stage B perform patient JIA . This open label design examine effect optimal dose duration ( either 10 minute 60 minute stimulation , determine result Stage A ) . All information regard Stage B register separate registration clincialtrials.gov . order keep accuracy . All detail concern Stage A .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The vagus nerve mediate `` inflammatory reflex '' ; mechanism central nervous system utilizes regulate innate adaptive immunity ( Andersson , 2012 ) . The afferent arm reflex sense inflammation peripherally central nervous system , down-regulates inflammation via efferent neural outflow . The efferent arm reflex term `` cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway '' ( CAP ) . The reflex serf physiological regulator inflammation respond environmental injury pathogen appropriate degree immune system activation An increase body evidence indicate CAP also harness reduce pathological inflammation . Electrical neurostimulation vagus nerve ( VNS ) either surgically implantable device , alternatively use non-invasive device stimulates auricular branch vagus nerve ( ABVN ) may feasible mean modulate disease characterize excessive dysregulated inflammation .</detailed_description>
