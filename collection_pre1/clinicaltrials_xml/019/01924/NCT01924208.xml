	<detailed_description>Background : Tonsils primary nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue constitute first contact point immune system allergens infectious agent . A peripheral T cell repertoire exist tonsil , tonsil active role induce maintain peripheral tolerance allergen . Intralymphatic immunotherapy promise alternative subcutaneous sublingual immunotherapy . More data need interaction peripheral ( tonsillar ) T cell response specific allergen exposure impact respiratory virus infection tolerance induction . Objective : To study effect sublingual grass pollen immunotherapy and/or nasal live attenuate influenza vaccine tonsillar T cell interferon ( IFN ) expression . In addition , collect material investigation role tissue immune tolerance chronicity allergic disease . Patients : Human tonsil sample obtain less 30-year-old routine tonsillectomy patient sublingual grass immunotherapy ( n=30 ) , nasal live attenuate influenza vaccine ( n=30 atopic ; n=30 non-atopic ) immunotherapy+influenza vaccine intervention ( n=30 ) . Controls without age limit intervention ( n=580 ) also recruit . Of , age atopy-matched control select comparator group intervention trial ( n=30 atopic ; n=30 non-atopic ) . Control group also use investigation role tissue immune tolerance chronicity allergic disease , immunomodulatory effect respiratory virus main focus human bocavirus human rhinovirus infection , search new respiratory virus . Design : Study intervention product administer openly immunology outcome analyse blindly . Main outcome : Gene expression IFN T cell relate gene main outcome compare intervention group correlate number allergen extract dos time nasal influenza vaccination . Systemic immunologic outcome ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell , blood RNA expression profile , antibody cytokines serum ) also study . The analysis include immunogenetics , virology , bacteriology sensitization status . Clinical symptom score record next 12 month screen visit . Anticipated result : We expect tonsil approach offer new vivo model understand immune tolerance induction give new insight immunologic mechanism lymphoid tissue level . We hope demonstrate immunologic effect sublingual pollen immunotherapy modify nasal live attenuate influenza vaccine thereby give basis add-on treatment aim effective immunotherapy . The influenza virus vaccine expect promote Th1 cell expression Th2 cell expression . Since immunologic outcome correlate clinical efficacy next influenza pollen season , hope understand clinical significance immunologic outcome . Innovation impact : The unique strength project answer essential question development allergen tolerance protective vaccine response human vivo situation answer setting . The proposed investigation may substantially enlarge knowledge pathogenesis organ direct allergic non-allergic inflammation human , experiment perform directly disease associate human cell tissue . We expect novel gene pathway immune regulation identify tonsil detailed investigation human immune response development sublingual immunotherapy influenza vaccine . The transcriptome epigenome group analyse role T cell , B cell innate lymphoid cell provide essential information particularly difference atopic non-atopic individual , anti-vaccine response , natural viral infection , chronic viral infection , mechanism hypertrophic tonsillitis versus recurrent tonsillitis . The identification new immune tolerance immune activation pathway involve regulation tissue cell expect provide novel knowledge many disease addition asthma , dysregulated immune system activation occur various human disorder cancer , autoimmunity , transplantation rejection chronic infection .</detailed_description>
