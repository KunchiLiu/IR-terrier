	<brief_summary>The goal study present large single-institution experience report surgical site infection rate patient undergone intra-abdominal surgery follow wound closure Negative Pressure Wound Therapy . A retrospective review patient ' chart conduct analyze surgical site infection rate wind closure without Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT ) . American College Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program data previous standard care ( primary closure colorectal surgery ) use comparison newly adopt standard care treatment regimen ( wound closure NPWT ) . Data patient underwent intra-abdominal surgery retrospectively collect database create . These individual identify medical record recontacted mail and/or phone collect study data . Finally , patient newly refer Principal Investigator intra-abdominal surgery enrol database . After give informed consent , data surgical site infection rate outcomes collect . Longitudinal outcome assess 30 day , 6 month , 12 month post-operatively . These patient ' outcome compare group patient treat Principal Investigator also undergo intra-abdominal surgery without Negative Pressure Wound Therapy . We hypothesize few patient treat negative pressure wound therapy follow intra-abdominal surgery develop surgical site infection patient intra-abdominal surgery treat Negative Pressure Wound Therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Duration individual study participation last approximately one year prospectively enrol participant . Data collection retrospectively enrol patient span approximately 12 month . Study data collect subject eligibility confirm patient assign study number . All information collect secure study-specific electronic registry database . The data review completeness accuracy Principal Investigator . This observational registry include investigatory agent pose minimal risk participant . Thus , monitor do study personnel - independent board necessary . This study use description grade scale find revise National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Version 4 . Information adverse event , whether volunteered subject , discover investigator , detect physical examination , laboratory test , mean , collect , record , follow appropriate . All adverse event experience participant collect report time consent Day 30 follow-up appointment , appropriate . Thereafter , adverse event interest ( i.e. , death , additional hospitalization , surgical site infection , surgical site occurrence ) record . Participants ongoing adverse event relate study procedure may continue periodically contact member study staff event resolve determine irreversible principal investigator . All adverse event serious adverse event report Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board . To generate large data set may use answer various research question , enrollment continue least 10 year , generate estimate patient sample size n=1200 . The study team anticipate enrol 100-150 patient study registry per year 10 year . Simple descriptive statistic use determine rate SSIs colorectal surgery patient . This rate compare SSI rate publish literature determine implementation negative pressure wound therapy wound closure follow colorectal surgery decrease rate SSIs colorectal surgery patient . A hypothesis test use determine difference adoption negative pressure wound therapy wound closure . Enrollment subject several year enable analysis possibility stratification accord different patient characteristic .</detailed_description>
