	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate feasibility safety MLN8237 ( alisertib ) give combination gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MLN8237 give combination gemcitabine patient advance solid tumor recommend phase II dose combination . II . To obtain preliminary evidence efficacy judge response rate progression-free survival combination . III . To investigate pharmacokinetics MLN8237 give combination gemcitabine expand cohort patient pancreatic cancer . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study alisertib . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
