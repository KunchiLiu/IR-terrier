	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer remain significant global public health problem . Although developed country incidence dramatically decrease , worldwide scale still lead cause cancer-related death . Surgery potentially curative treatment gastric cancer . Although survival rate patient early stage disease ( stage 1A 1B ) good , subgroup patient constitute 20 % undergoing resection . The majority patient locally advance metastatic disease presentation , extremely poor prognosis . The current five-year survival rate gastric cancer Western country approximately 20-30 % , figure improve little past 30 year . The intervention arm TOPGEAR consist pre-operative chemotherapy , pre-operative chemoradiotherapy , surgery post-operative chemotherapy . The control arm consist pre-operative chemotherapy , surgery post-operative chemotherapy . The primary objective TOPGEAR investigate whether addition chemoradiotherapy chemotherapy superior chemotherapy alone neoadjuvant set improve pathological complete response rate first instance , subsequently overall survival , patient undergo adequate surgery ( D1+ dissection ) resectable gastric cancer .</brief_summary>
