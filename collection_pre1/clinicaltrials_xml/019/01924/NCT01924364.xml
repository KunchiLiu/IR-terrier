	<brief_summary>The overall purpose research evaluate physical change occur time fat graft craniofacial trauma . This protocol similar exist study ( IRB # PRO0906101 ) presently conduct University Pittsburgh research team utilize fat graft . The preparation fat graft material clinical trial process differently evaluate effect graft resorption treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Concentrating Endogenous Stromal Cells Fat Graft Using TGI Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective propose clinical investigation Tissue Genesis Cell Isolation Systemâ„¢ ( CIS ) device constitutes feasibility study direct initial evaluation device certain clinical population , namely subject undergoing craniofacial fat grafting . 1 . Treat disfigure craniofacial injury 5 subject fat graft enhance adipose SVF via TGI 1000 isolation method improve form high level precision . Facial appearance persistence treatment effect assess use aesthetic grading scale , state art 3D photography , high resolution CT scan 3D reconstruction . Patients follow 24 month treatment define long term outcome . 2 . Assess biologic property cell within fat graft correlate clinical outcome . This include adipose stem cell yield per volume fat tissue , cell proliferation , capacity adipogenic differentiation , lipolysis , cell sub-population analysis multiparameter flow cytometry . Results assay correlate graft volume retention search predictor good clinical outcome relate variation adipose biology subject . 3 . Measure quality life patient autologous fat graft use validated psychosocial measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects male female , military civilian , 18 year age older able provide inform consent 2 . Have suffer injury result craniofacial volume defect could treat graft volume 3 100 cc lipoaspirate 3 . Be least 3 month postinjury postsurgery ( trauma procedure ) acute edema resolve 4 . Volume defect cover intact skin communicate oral cavity sinuses 5 . The three dimensional geometry volume defect would allow treatment lipoaspirate injection least two distinct treat area could discern gross examination radiographically ( e.g . treated region opposite side face , low face versus upper face , separate bony landmark zygoma . This would include ability treat uninjured region fat graft order obtain symmetry balance . 6 . Subjects , opinion Investigator , able understand study , comply study design willing return clinic research require followup visit 1 . Craniofacial defect intend treatment open wound communicate oral cavity sinus ( note : presence defect set another defect ( ) meet treatment criterion exclude patient participate ) . 2 . Active infection anywhere body 3 . Diagnosis cancer within last 12 month /or actively receive chemotherapy radiation treatment 4 . Subjects know idiopathic drugassociated coagulopathy assess screen history physical examination . 5 . Subjects , determine investigator history clinical manifestation significant renal , hepatic , cardiovascular , metabolic , neurologic , psychiatric , condition would preclude participation study ( i.e . Type 1 Type 2 diabetic patient ) condition within last 14 day require hospitalization surgical intervention . 6 . Subjects pregnant , lactating , woman childbearing potential abstinent practice acceptable mean contraception , determine Investigator , duration treatment phase 7 . Subjects know alcohol narcotic drug dependency 8 . Subjects history abnormal blood biochemistry abnormal laboratory finding , define normal value range within UPMC Laboratory 's value reference whose value consider determined investigator clinically significant , would render subject inappropriate surgical procedure ( i.e . CBC Differential , platelet , comprehensive metabolic panel include electrolyte , bun/creatinine , liver function test coagulation test ) . Reference UPMC Laboratory normal value document ( Attachment # 18 ) 9 . Subjects life expectancy &lt; 9 month , terminal condition factor make followup difficult ( e.g . fix address , telephone etc ) 10 . Subjects know allergy collagenase , ingredient use TGI CIS process SVF product . 11 . Subjects Axis II diagnosis DSMIV ( e.g. , Schizophrenia , Bipolar Disorder ) . Subjects find stable medication receive psychiatric clearance could eligible study participation per Physician 's discretion .</criteria>
