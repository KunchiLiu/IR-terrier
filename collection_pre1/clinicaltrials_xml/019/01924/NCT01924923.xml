	<brief_title>New Biopsy Technique Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveal melanoma common primary malignancy eye one fatal disease detect initially eye examination . For many year , clinical decision-making regard patient uveal melanoma require treatment base solely clinical feature observe time diagnosis . These feature include : tumor size measure ultrasound , associate subretinal fluid , presence orange lipofuscin pigment , lack drusen , posterior location , ciliary body involvement . All clinical feature demonstrate associated tumor growth associate eventual development metastasis . However , clinical feature adequately sensitive specific enough predict patient develop metastasis . More recently , researcher study genomics uveal melanoma focus identify genetic abnormality present tumor tissue order characterize lesion fully . Several landmark paper past 15 year report cytogenic genomic abnormality uveal melanoma tumor tissue associate poor prognosis . Although rare , least five case patient undergo biopsy lesion develop extraocular spread melanoma biopsy site . With new technique , possible rate extraocular spread lower , make biopsy safer technique currently practice .</detailed_description>
