	<brief_summary>Background : Stroke represent one major health problem worldwide , particularly transitional industrialized country . Stroke remarkable socioeconomic impact , especially age population , therefore stroke prevention important . Secondary preventive measure rehabilitation essential reduction recurrent event . However , date appropriate secondary preventive program patient survive stroke minor residual deficit poorly study . Specific aims/projects : The aim study validate effect outpatient secondary prevention program vascular risk factor , adherence vascular-protective medication , exercise capacity health relate quality life . Working Hypothesis : The outpatient rehabilitation program result significant short ( 3 month ) long-term ( 1 year ) improvement vascular risk factor , neurological function , exercise capacity , adherence vasoprotective medication health relate quality life . Experimental design/Methods : This prospective , randomized clinical trial . At least 100 patient randomize either group start rehabilitation program immediately stroke delay 3 month . All patient assess baseline , 3 month 1 year . The primary outcome number reach cardiovascular health goal ( 6 metric ) immediate delay program start group 3 month . Expected value propose project : The study potential show outpatient rehabilitation program significantly improve vascular risk factor , adherence medication , enhance quality life eventually reduce recurrent stroke vascular event . If confirm , introduce outpatient rehabilitation program major socioeconomic impact .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Stroke represent one major health problem worldwide , particularly transitional industrialized country . Stroke rank first cause handicap adult , second cause dementia , third cause death frequent cause epilepsy , depression , fall acute hospital admission . Stroke remarkable socioeconomic impact , especially age population , therefore stroke prevention important . Stroke beget stroke . Persons suffer stroke high risk suffer additional stroke . Therefore , prevention person part medical management . However , secondary stroke prevention complex due numerous risk factor include pharmacological intervention non-pharmacological mean risk factor reduction . Up 90 % stroke risk attributable vascular risk factor . Therefore , appropriate use proven measure risk factor reduction could prevent 90 % stroke . This include smoke cessation , control hypertension diabetes , anticoagulant antiplatelet agent lipid lower drug , healthy lifestyle regular physical activity , healthy normocaloric diet , moderate alcohol consumption , low-normal body weight avoidance distress . Importantly , effective stroke prevention achieve reduction several vascular risk factor . Secondary preventive measure rehabilitation essential reduction recurrent event . Furthermore , moderate severely handicapped patient receive in- outpatient rehabilitation adapt individual deficit . The concept secondary prevention cardiac rehabilitation accept treatment modality patient myocardial infarction aortocoronary bypass surgery . However , appropriate secondary preventive program patient survive stroke minor residual deficit lack . Therefore , investigator develop structure 12 week hospital base out-patient program stroke patient minor residual deficit base already exist format cardiac rehabilitation optimize secondary stroke prevention , relieve symptom , improve neurological functioning , improve health relate quality life . In prospective interventional single center cohort pilot study 105 patient ( submit publication ) , investigator show 12 week outpatient rehabilitation program result considerable improvement vascular risk factor , neurological function , enhance health relate quality life ( see attach abstract ) . The aim additional study validate effect outpatient program prospective , randomized clinical trial crossover design . Objective The aim study validate effect outpatient secondary prevention program vascular risk factor , adherence vascular-protective medication , exercise capacity health relate quality life . Methods This prospective , randomized clinical trial . At least 100 patient minor stroke transient ischemic attack treat University Hospital Bern randomize either group start rehabilitation program immediately stroke delay 3 month . All patient assess baseline , 3 month 1 year . The primary outcome number reach cardiovascular health goal ( 6 metric : smoking , physical exercise capacity , Mediterranean diet compliance , LDL-Cholesterol , Blood pressure , fast plasma glucose ) immediate delay program start group 3 month . After inclusion 100 patient study , study independent statistician perform power analysis final number patient include adapt .</detailed_description>
