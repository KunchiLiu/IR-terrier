	<brief_summary>The Department Veterans Affairs `` Randomized On/Off Bypass '' ( ROOBY ) Trial ( CSP # 517 ) fund 2001 . ROOBY design compare short-term ( 30-day ) intermediate-term ( 1-year ) outcomes patient undergo off-pump versus on-pump coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) procedure . The ROOBY trial report significantly high 1-year adverse composite outcome rate ( i.e. , all-cause death , non-fatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) and/or repeat revascularization ) off-pump versus on-pump patient . ROOBY document high percentage off-pump patient receive few graft originally plan ( i.e. , off-pump patient less completely revascularized ) compare on-pump patient . Across anatomic region heart , 1-year graft patency rate significantly low off-pump CABG patient . Based ROOBY trial initial finding , critically important clinical question relate long-term efficacy , stability durability off-pump versus on-pump technique raise . Extending original ROOBY trial , CSP # 517 follow-up study ( CSP 517-FS ) evaluate longer-term impact off-pump versus on-pump surgical approach upon future occurrence major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A debate ongoing potential longer-term benefit off-pump versus on-pump treatment . A recent meta-analysis summarize 12 randomized trial follow-up extend beyond 1-year ; significant increase document late off-pump repeat revascularization mortality rate . As large single center study longer-term follow-up , Beijing hospital study report early minor advantage identify off-pump surgery ( n = 3,266 ) offset 4.5 year increase risk cardiac death , acute MI repeat revascularization compare on-pump ( n = 3,399 ) approach . The OCTOPUS study ( multi-center randomize trial base Netherlands ) conclude difference off-pump versus on-pump procedure 5-year cardiac outcome . However , OCTOPUS critic raise question whether study 281 low-risk patient adequately power detect 5-year clinically relevant difference . The ROOBY trial represent US-based , multi-center trial adequately power detect clinically relevant , statistically significant difference long-term MACE ( i.e. , cause mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction , and/or repeat revascularization ) outcomes . Recognized landmark study , ROOBY result important contribution include 10 manuscript , 2 letter editor , invite editorial . As October 11 , 2012 , 182 manuscript ( include self-citations ) reference ROOBY trial 's original 2009 publication . Most recently , ROOBY trial identify 2012 Almanac adult cardiac surgery , national society journal present select research drive recent clinical care advance . Additionally , ROOBY judge independently March 2012 Cochrane systematic review one three , multi-center trial conduct to-date low risk bias . The original ROOBY trial 's enrollment initiate February 2002 end June 2007 . Given passage time , possible obtain least 5 year follow-up identify critically important longer-term MACE endpoint ROOBY patient . For early ROOBY patient enrol , MACE outcomes ( potentially beyond ) 10 year post-CABG may assess . These MACE endpoint ascertain use combination VA non-VA database extract well chart review . In summary , CSP 517-FS propose study represent first , large scale , US-based , multi-center , randomize , control off-pump versus on-pump trial adequate power ass major adverse cardiovascular event beyond 5 year - compare long-term effectiveness procedure guide future adult cardiac surgical clinical decision-making process .</detailed_description>
