	<detailed_description>Since introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) 1996 , dramatic reduction morbidity mortality among live HIV . However , chronic liver disease due coinfection hepatitis B ( HBV ) C ( HCV ) virus emerge second leading cause mortality among HIV-infected person . The natural history HBV infection alter HIV . Current guideline recommend coinfected patient treat HIV HBV infection use combination ART include tenofovir ( TDF ) . Despite widespread adoption US , effect regimen long-term outcome HBV disease histologic severity , progression , risk emergence resistant HBV variant , long term risk TDF therapy remain unanswered . Further investigation require address follow important question : ( 1 ) proportion HIV-coinfected patient incomplete viral suppression TDF ? ; ( 2 ) incomplete suppression HBV acceptable HIV coinfected person , threshold HBV DNA level constitutes adequate clinical goal ? ; ( 3 ) view lack acceptance liver biopsy among HIV practitioner , noninvasive marker accurately assess HBV disease activity impact ART disease progression ? ; ( 4 ) What long term risk TDF-based therapy HBV HIV coinfection ? In short , risks benefit TDF-based therapy CHB patient HIV coinfection ? The NIH Hepatitis B Research Network ( HBRN ) first major effort elucidate natural history treatment outcomes person chronic HBV US . The HBRN address critical issue HBV liver disease progression HIV-infected person patient HIV coinfection exclude . The current proposal , approve ancillary study HBRN , offer unique opportunity fill major gap HBV-HIV knowledge compare HBV-HIV infected person HBV monoinfection participate HBRN . No fund research network North America expertise , patient population , structure carry propose study . The Specific Aims : 1 . Define problem . We clinically , histologically , serologically , virologically characterize well-defined cohort HBV-HIV patient North America cross-sectional manner ; 2 . Define benefit long term therapy . We longitudinally determine impact complete vs. incomplete viral suppression clinical serologic outcome , histologic progression pair biopsy 2a . Define threshold HBV DNA level associate disease progression ; 2b . Establish utility noninvasive assessment hepatic fibrosis compare biopsy ; 2c . Define frequency genotypic phenotypic TDF resistance long term therapy ; finally 3 . Define risk long term therapy . We assess long term renal bone effect TDF-based therapy HBV-HIV cohort . Collectively , study fulfill many key priority outline NIH Action Plan Liver Disease HBV-HIV coinfection .</detailed_description>
