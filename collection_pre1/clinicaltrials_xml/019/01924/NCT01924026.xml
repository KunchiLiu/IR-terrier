	<brief_summary>Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) genetic disorder know cause severe reduction intelligence deficit cognitive function ; associate elevate level Phenylalanine ( Phe ) blood . Newborn screen early treatment restrict protein diet supplemented formula amino-acids preserve intelligence . In severe form treat birth , deficit affect high function brain see . Given , disagreement milder form disease manage level Phe safe leave untreated . We seek assess whether high Phe level , 360 600µmol/L , safe respect preservation intelligence higher cognitive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The following personal/medical information collect reviewed : - Evaluation current past medical history , include psychological treatment medication counseling/therapy . - Mutational analysis MHP subject - Detailed history educational , employment , relationship , socioeconomic status/achievements measure successful transition adulthood - Diet history , include past treatment medical food Sapropterin ( Kuvan ) pre-conceptual pregnancy Phe management - All available untreated Phe level , include newborn screening result ( possible ) collate calculate lifetime mean Phe level . Age collection record separately MHP subject ensure inclusion Phe level beyond infancy The following clinical investigation administer : - Measurement Phe Tyrosine overnight fast , via blood spot use tandem mass spectrometry analysis . Blood spot collection do time day subject . - Physical exam , height weight measurement - Food Frequency Questionnaire assessment estimate typical daily intake natural protein . - Self-Report Questionnaires : - Behavior Rating Inventory Executive Function ( BRIEF ) -A - Beck Anxiety Inventory - Beck Depression Inventory - Quality Life questionnaire - Neuropsychological Tests assess trained psychologist An informant BRIEF-A report complete subject . To ensure consistency rating , informant use possible MHP subject sibling control ( i.e . parent ) . These questionnaire mail informant return study site via FedEx .</detailed_description>
