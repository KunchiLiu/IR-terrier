	<detailed_description>Objective . Identification genetic risk factor predispose nicotine abuse dependence , elucidation neurobiological mechanism action , critical individualize treatment prevention nicotine addiction . Nicotine exert effect brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChRs ) . The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) rs16969968 CHRNA5 gene encode 5 subunit nAChRs unequivocally associate smoking behavior nicotine dependence genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) . At brain level , salience network ( SN ) neural circuitry connect anterior insula ( AI ) , dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) , ventral striatum ( VS ) , extend amygdala show crucially involved nicotine addiction . The SN detect salient event initiate rapid switch large-scale brain network , default-mode network ( DMN ) executive control network ( ECN ) , control behavior . Genetic influence SN may therefore explain individual difference susceptibility addiction . We previously show resting-state connectivity SN decrease smoker non-smokers rs16969968 risk allele . But underlie neurobiological process still unknown . Given well-established role dopamine ( DA ) addiction , presence nAChRs DA neuron , one plausible mechanism involve cholinergic modulation DA transmission . Consequently , employ integrative imaging pharmacogenetics approach test DA mediation rs16969968 effect SN healthy non-smoking participant , goal elucidate neurobiological mechanism underlie association SNP susceptibility nicotine dependence without confound chronic smoking . Study Population . Sixty pre-screened participant classify two equal group ( n = 30 per group ) base rs16969968 genotype : 1 ) rs16969968 risk allele homozygote , A/A genotype ( Risk Group ) ; 2 ) rs16969968 non-risk allele homozygote , G/G genotype ( Non-Risk Group ) . Participants healthy , right-handed male female , age 18-55 , non-smokers free lifetime substance dependence . Design . A double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover design use . Each participant complete screening session ( Screening Protocol 06-DA-N415 ) ; orientation session , include nicotine patch tolerance test ; 4 image visit , different pharmacological pre-treatment prior scanning : 1 ) placebo pill + placebo patch ; 2 ) 20 mg oral methylphenidate + placebo patch ; 3 ) 2 mg oral haloperidol + placebo patch ; 4 ) placebo pill + 7 mg nicotine patch . Outcome Measures . The study use neuroimaging ( fMRI ) ass impact rs16969968 genotype drug condition ( MPH vs. haloperidol vs. nicotine vs. placebo ) SN , ECN , DMN function rest task performance . The primary outcome measure : 1 ) network coherence , indexed resting-state task-related functional connectivity ( FC ) ; 2 ) dynamic task-related interaction ; 3 ) behavioral task performance .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The inclusion criterion follow : 1 . Participants must 1855 year age . Justification : Many neural process change age , include attribute , interaction , three brain network assess study . In addition , risk difficulttodetect medical abnormality silent cerebral infarct increase age . Assessment tool ( ) : driver license , birth certificate , governmentissued forms identification . 2 . Participants must righthanded . Justification : Some neural process assess protocol may lateralize brain . In order reduce potential variance , participant require righthanded . Assessment tool ( ) : Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . 3 . Participants must good health . Justification : Many illness may alter fMRI signal well neural functioning . Assessment tool ( ) : Participants provide brief health history phone screening , undergo medical history physical examination IRP clinician . 4 . Participants must free lifetime substance dependence , free substance abuse last 2 year , substance , include nicotine , alcohol , prescription drug , illicit drug , accord DSMIV diagnostic criterion . With respect tobacco use , participant must current smoker must never daily smoker 1 month . In addition , MAI and/or PI use medical/scientific judgment casebycase basis disqualify potential participant participation low level use . Justification : Abuse dependence drug alcohol may result unique CNS deficit could confound result . This eligibility criterion particularly important current study , examine neurobiological process underlying susceptibility drug dependence absence , precede , chronic use development dependence . Assessment tool ( ) : The computerized SCID clinical substance abuse/dependence assessment . While recreational/intermittent use alcohol and/or marijuana tolerate , individual exclude participation meet lifetime DSMIV diagnosis abuse dependence . 5 . Both male female participant enrol study . 6 . While target A/A homozygotes G/G homozygotes rs16969968 locus , also allow A/G heterozygotes become enrolled study . The enrollment open racial ethnic group , include Caucasians , African Americans , Asians , well Hispanic nonHispanics , make effort include racial ethnic group long participant meet rs16969968 genotype criterion . Justification : The allele frequency rs16969968 locus vary greatly racial ethnic group , make extremely difficult ensure balance ethnicity across genotype group . In particular , minor A allele rs16969968 ( Risk allele current study ) , associate increase risk heavy smoking nicotine dependence , frequency 0.42 Caucasians , rare Asians ( 0.03 ) African Americans ( 0.07 ) ( Saccone et al. , 2010b ) . Therefore , assume HardyWeinberg Equilibrium , need recruit approximately 275 Caucasian subject order meet enrollment target n = 40 per genotype group ( i.e. , 40 A/A 40 G/G ) , A/A homozygotes limit factor . For comparison , A/A rare African Americans ( 0.0049 ; 49 10,000 ) , would need recruit 8,000 African American subject meet enrollment target n = 40 ethnic group ; aim 20 African American subject sample ( close distribution Baltimore area ) , would still recruit 4,000 African American subject . The frequency A/A homozygotes Asian population even daunt ( 0.0009 ; 9 10,000 ) . Importantly , association rs16969968 locus nicotine addiction severity demonstrate three ethnic group recent metaanalysis ( Chen et al. , 2012 ) , argue racial ethnic group enrol current study still benefit basic , mechanistic knowledge gain study translated clinical treatment prevention nicotine abuse dependence future .
