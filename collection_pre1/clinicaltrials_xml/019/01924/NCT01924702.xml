	<brief_title>Chronic Aphasia - Improved Intensive Training Electrical Brain Stimulation ( CATS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause death disability worldwide . Given increase average lifespan worldwide , incidence prevalence patient stroke dramatically increase future . One frequent devastate condition stroke aphasia , affect language production comprehension . High-frequent intensive speech-and-language therapy currently treatment choice chronic aphasia . However , despite general effectiveness , treatment effect size low moderate . Thus , press need explore novel training-adjuvant therapy enhance treatment efficacy . Moreover , little known neurobiology treatment-induced recovery chronic aphasia . This prerequisite improve exist and/or develop new treatment paradigm . Thus , present project investigator aim ass whether outcome intensive language training enhance adjuvant non-invasive brain stimulation . They use anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( atDCS ) previously show enhance ( ) language motor learn healthy subject ( b ) motor recovery stroke patient . Specifically , longitudinal group comparison design , two match group patient chronic anomia receive two week intensive language training without atDCS . Treatment effect assess immediately two week intervention period several month end training . The Investigators also use functional structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) elucidate language network change two group .</detailed_description>
