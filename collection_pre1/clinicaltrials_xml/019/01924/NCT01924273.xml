	<detailed_description>Pulsed dye laser currently standard care treatment Port wine stain . Researchers University California Irvine Beckman Laser Institute Medical Clinic use Photodynamic therapy , another treatment option Port wine stain . Photodynamic therapy involve light activation photosensitizer ( drug responsive light radiant energy ) . Because photosensitizer localize desired portion Port wine stain , Photodynamic therapy create opportunity target destruction Port wine stain . Researchers use photosensitizer medication call Talaporfin sodium , intravenously administer investigational photosensitizer , evaluate multiple clinical indication . Photodynamic therapy talaporfin sodium investigate many different condition , use treatment Port wine stain . Photosensitivity precaution instruction provide , include appropriate photo protective clothing , protective hat sunglasses wrap around temple help minimize lateral sun light exposure travel home follow discharge study site . For efficacy , evaluate study variable Port wine stain blanching , researcher use diffuse reflectance image chromametry , Laser Speckle Imaging Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging measure change Port wine stain blanching . The maximum power Laser Speckle Imaging Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging light source 10-50 mW , comparable halogen-bulb household flashlight . Efficacy evaluate base comparison pre-treatment visit post treatment day 1 , week 1 , week 4 , week 12 measurement .</detailed_description>
