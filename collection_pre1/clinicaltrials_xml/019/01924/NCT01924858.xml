	<brief_summary>This open label , PET study healthy male subject determine GSK2647544 able cross blood-brain-barrier . The study use GSK2647544 radiolabelled fluorine-18 ( [ 18F ] GSK2647544 ) determine ratio concentration compound tissue plasma equilibrium , express PET volume distribution ( VT ) . The study consist least four visit ; 2 screen visit , scan day follow-up . On Day 1 ( scan day ) subject receive single oral dose GSK2647544 ( 100 mg ) follow approximately 2 hour later single intravenous ( IV ) infusion [ 18F ] -GSK2647544 dynamic PET scan . Arterial venous blood sampling use determine plasma kinetics [ 18F ] -GSK2647544 unlabeled GSK2647544 . In addition , subject undergo structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain aid definition neuroanatomy . The dose GSK2647544 select base review safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) data obtain first time human ( FTIH ) study .</brief_summary>
