	<detailed_description>Reducing risk suicide attempt suicide public health priority . There substantial decrease suicide past two decade . Prevention effort date focus primary ( e.g . public service announcement ) tertiary ( e.g . intervention follow suicide attempt ) method . Secondary indicated prevention relatively unexplored . Secondary prevention require accurate screen method effective intervention . These essential element available . Our recent research demonstrate response suicidal ideation item PHQ depression scale powerful predictor subsequent suicide attempt death . Availability PHQ electronic medical record create opportunity accurate population-level screening . Dialectical behavior therapy ( DBT ) strong evidence tertiary efficacy prevent suicide attempt clinical population . Brief outreach tertiary intervention care message evidence prevent suicide attempt . These clinical tertiary prevention intervention provide best available evidence use building secondary prevention program . Resulting program could link population-level screen data electronic medical record . The first goal research plan adapt DBT care message fit delivery model suitable large number at-risk patient identifiable healthcare setting . The second goal evaluate feasibility , acceptability , safety alternative online suicide self-injury secondary prevention program . Online delivery model suitable scalable provide securely , cheaply , utilize exist system healthcare . Three brief online intervention evaluate : caring email ( CE ) ; CE + DBT online program ; CE + DBT online program + coach . Each intervention supplement usual care among high- risk patient identify via PHQ depression scale collect outpatient primary care mental health visit . Intervention content drawn principle DBT caring message . The study design additive order examine alternative intervention model vary widely resource require large- scale delivery . However , intervention require vastly few resource in-person telephone intervention . The project involve intervention feasibility ( pretesting , N=60 ) acceptability safety test ( pilot , N=400 ) . Acceptability wll assess patient intervention engagement level ( require large pilot sample ) qualitative/formative intervention feedback patient . Safety assess via rate psychiatric hospitalization self-injury diagnose medical record intervention condition compare receive continue usual care . Results pilot study inform design full-scale effectiveness trial examine impact one intervention risk suicide attempt and/or suicide death .</detailed_description>
