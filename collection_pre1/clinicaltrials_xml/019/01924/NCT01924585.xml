	<brief_summary>Surgery person old AGE ( SAGE ) observational study patient age 60 year old undergo major colorectal surgery . That say look old patient recovery follow surgery , patient volunteer take part absolutely change make patient planned treatment surgery . Patients ( identify Consultant ) ask would like participate study , agree undertake additional questionnaire , blood test , provide urine specimen several basic physical test pre-assessment visit take additional 30-45 minute . This affect treatment way . Participation voluntary . At time pre-assessment process patient approach researcher , explain study detail obtain write consent . The questionnaire combination question , use similar study may use identify people fit others undergo surgery . These question dissimilar may ask pre-assessment process . In fact hospital use question ( usually ) routinely hospital admission process . Several basic physical test perform : hand grip strength test basic walk chair rise test . These supervise train researcher ensure carry safely . A small blood sample ( 20ml ) obtain , ideally time blood take standard pre-operative assessment process . We also take urine specimen . The blood sample urine specimens save test later . There several potential blood urine test may relate physical frailty/impairment age process . The patient undergo surgery plan discharge hospital . No researcher interfere plan care conduct data collection point . At approximately 1 . 3 , 6 12 month follow surgery patient ask complete questionnaire either person , phone mail . If review clinic time postoperative follow-up check , repeat basic physical test also . The patient 's note review researcher ( also doctor ) see operation perform , length hospital stay , problem develop . The patient GP may also contact additional information require . This study , base several others , first kind see person recover surgery assess one year . We recruit 18 month across two hospital aim recruit 200 patient time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Lifespans increase proportion elderly person undergo surgery increase [ 1 ] . As clinician need accurately communicate risk major surgery patient . Traditional risk prediction tool Physiologic operative Severity Score enumeration Mortality Morbidity ( POSSUM ) estimate short-term outcome [ 2 ] . Patients right know likely outcomes beyond 30-day perioperative period , include life expectancy , long-term complication , level independence quality life [ 3 ] . Based systematic review literature previously report paucity study evaluate longer-term outcome person advance age undergo major surgery [ 4 ] . Our group previously report , analysis perform English administrative dataset , patient face comparatively high mortality 29 % one year follow colorectal surgery perform emergency [ 5 ] . Furthermore , publish finding , national datasets , patient 75-80 year age undergoing colorectal resection elective setting also face substantial mortality 16 % one-year , third patient age &gt; 89 year underwent surgery survive one-year [ 6 ] . Frailty , distinct entity co-morbidity , recognize independent contributor mortality elderly surgical patient [ 7-10 ] . Thus need improve preoperative risk stratification geriatric patient . Such system may include frailty assessment relevant predictive biomarkers . Thus target additional healthcare resource towards frail vulnerable elderly patient mitigate risk postoperative complication death [ 11 ] . Preoperative optimisation strategy [ 12-14 ] , careful intraoperative monitoring postoperative care within high dependency set may reduce frequency postoperative complication , accelerate recovery improve short-term outcome . Furthermore , need collaborative research elderly care community physicians determine whether ongoing postoperative community rehabilitation offset late risk death associate major surgery improve long-term survival . Rationale Current Study : Research Question What preoperative parameter use predict patient center outcome ( survival , complication , functional independence , quality life ) old person undergo major gastrointestinal elective surgery intermediate term ? Hypotheses Traditional POSSUM score system reliably predict outcome 1 year elderly person . Patients determine frail preoperatively bad outcome 1 year , term survival , postoperative complication , level independence quality life . Study Objectives To identify preoperative parameter predict 1 year outcomes patient age â‰¥60 year undergo major gastrointestinal elective surgery . Parameters include comprehensive geriatric assessment ( i.e . preoperative questionnaire validate instrument assess dimension co-morbidities , activity daily live , nutrition , cognitive function , emotional status , fatigue performance status ) . Furthermore patient ask undergo series simple physical exercise ( hand grip strength , timing go , 15 foot time walk test , 6 minute walk test ) . Preoperative serum result also incorporate . Additional blood urine sample obtain preoperative later metabolic profiling . Questionnaire , physical test biological sample assessed time preoperative assessment process , another time preoperatively patient convenience . Serum sample obtain preoperatively . Urine sample may collect follow surgery .</detailed_description>
