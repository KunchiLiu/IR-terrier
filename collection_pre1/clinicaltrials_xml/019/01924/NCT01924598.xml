	<detailed_description>Our hypothesis , base prior research , DBS nucleus accumbens beneficial neural symptomatic effect severe Anorexia Nervosa . As pilot test hypothesis , evaluate acceptability ethical issue aim initially study 3 patient . This pilot study may provide important clinical scientific information contribute large study . DESIGN SUMMARY The design consist case series 6 patient repeated measure . The individual female age 20-65 least 7 year history severe treatment resistant AN , fully consent motivate recover . The patient select basis specific suitability criterion . A small case series study design need novel invasive strategy , information acceptability , feasibility neural process involve required inform extensive study . This optimally obtain initial detailed study small number patient . As heterogeneity response likely , advise external reviewer Professor Walter Kaye , aim study 6 patient rather single patient pilot . The intervention bilateral deep brain stimulation target nucleus accumbens stimulation ventral anterior limb internal capsule . Following DBS patient follow every month week 13 month . First , recruitment 2 month preoperative period thorough preoperative examination ethical issue include qualitative semi structure interview ( MacCATCR ( MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool Clinical Research ) ) ass competence inform consent complete independent researcher experience ethical issue AN ( Jacinta Tan ) . The study participants initial research assessment review every month joint eat disorder psychiatry -neurosurgery clinic . In month 10 two randomly assign 2 week period active sham stimulation , . monthly assessment include : • BMI • Semi structure interview : Eating Disorder Eating Disorder Examination ( EDE ) - Yale Brown CornellEating Disorder Scale ( YBCEDS ) - Observer rat comorbidity ( SCID / Hamilton Depression rating scale ) - Computerized behavioural task : Food reward ( Leeds-Oxford food preference task ) habit formation task - Self report schedule : EDE Questionnaire , functional impairment ( CIA ) , quality life scale ( WHOQUALBREF ) ; starvation dependence scale , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI , Beck et al . 1961 ) , State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( Spielberger , 1998 ) , Snaith-Hamilton pleasure scale ( SHAPS , Snaith et al . 1995 ) Ruminative Response Scale Eating Disorders ( RRSED ) . Pre-operative image involve fMRI MEG . Post-operative image involve 3 MEG scan , two month 10 study end , 15 month . DETAILS OF METHODOLOGY : Subjects selection recruitment : A list eligible patient , fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion make discussion Specialist Eating Disorder service clinician . Patients rank order suitability accord specific suitability criterion : i. Severity intractiblity Anorexia Nervosa ii . Restrictive anorexia nervosa - without binging/purging iii . Absence currently severe comorbid Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) , depression self-harm iv . Ideally , minimal Psychotropic medication v. No recent history compulsory treatment ( i.e . last year ) vi . Has try exist treatment option without success vii . Has never period full remission viii . Intensity desire recover ix . Good intellectual function education - well able comprehend fact intervention ( e.g . healthcare background , university education ) x . Poor social occupational function , high level distress - functioning well , poor quality life . The high ranked patient ask consent receive information project . If interested approach Dr Park information project , give information sheet opportunity discuss family member . If remain interested offer opportunity meet Dr Park Professor Aziz , information address question , involve family wish . Following review Dr Park week later thus give week decide would like participate . Consent participate project take Dr Park freely withdraw point effect usual clinical care . Throughout study patient receive supportive treatment usual clinical team independent research team , make clear opt study point without give explanation . If patient consent participation preoperative assessment University Research Department Warneford hospital : I : PREOPERATIVE PHASE : 2 month 1 . Initial assessment Research team . BMI : height weight Semi structure interview Eating Disorder comorbidity : EDE , SCID , Yale-Brown-Obsessive Compulsive scale ( YBOCS ) ; Self report questionnaire index mood quality life Computerised Behavioural task : Leeds -Oxford food preference task , Habit formation task 2 . Weekly self report measure symptom do home , weekly ( 5 minute ) use ' True Colours ' online self monitoring system pioneer University Oxford Department Psychiatry , adapt Eating disorder Dr Park include OXBREAD brief rating scale . http : //oxtext.psych.ox.ac.uk/true-colours . This self report system continue entry study end . These self report schedule augment brief weekly - line face face review skype face time aim offering participant maximal support monitoring . 3 . Neuropsychological assessment battery , duration approximately 1 hour : ( Neuropsychological assessment routine DBS operation do Oxford ) . • WAIS IV subtests : Vocabulary , Matrix Reasoning , Digit Span , Coding ( Wechsler 2008 ) : Measures general intellectual skill need make sense performance across cognitive domain . • BIRT Memory Information Processing Battery : List Learning Task . Baseline measure Verbal Memory Learning ( Coughlan , Oddly , &amp; Crawford , , 2007 ) . • Verbal Fluency . Baseline measure Phonemic Semantic Fluency ( Spreen , &amp; Strauss 1998 ) . • CANTAB : IED SWM subtests : Assess executive faculty set shift spatial work memory ( Robbins , James , Owen , Sahakian , McInnes &amp; Rabbitt , 1994 ) 4 . Preoperative Capacity assessment Once suitable patient identify , consent , Dr Jacinta Tan interview patient independently full MacCAT-CR assessment plus depth interview explore patient 's experience treatment , rationale participation motivation take part research participant ' perspective , ensure high level capacity , voluntariness inform consent . The assessment expect take 2.5 -3 hour do section patient tire . It tape record transcribed . Jacinta score MacCAT-CR independent observer also score MacCAT-CR . Both also provide global assessment capacity consent research . Dr Tan provide detailed report interview assessment ethical acceptability participation individual . If decides patient suitable , process repeat next individual list agrees . 5 . Neuroimaging : Pre-operatively patient : whole brain MRI scan include T1 , T2 , Inversion Recovery sequence fMRI rest state task base use food reward task : These scan occur John Radcliffe Hospital , Oxford ; total duration 1 hour . whole brain MEG scan- rest state task base food reward task , do Warneford Hospital , Oxford , duration 30 minute .
