However , optimal protocol achieve adequate placental transfusion know . The practice cord clamp birth uniform among obstetrical provider adequate evidence support early late cord clamp lack . Women eligible enroll study pregnancy complication , smoke , plan breastfeed , plan deliver vaginally 37 416/7 week . Women enrol prenatally labor delivery unit . At birth , woman assign one four cord clamping/milking group . A cohort infant immediate cord clamp serf reference group . Infants blood sample draw routine newborn screen blood sample do 36 48 hour . Information infant health feeding complete in-hospital visit mother home visit two week age . The primary outcome measure placental residual blood volume compliance various assign cord clamping protocol . It expect infant delay cord clamp cord milk would less placental residual blood volume provider would comply various random assignment .</detailed_description>
