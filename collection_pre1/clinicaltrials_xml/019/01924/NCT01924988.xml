	<detailed_description>Objectives investigation This study primary goal determine safety prostatic artery embolization ( PAE ) benign prostatic hyperplasia . Our primary outcome frequency adverse event , particularly bladder rectal complication , may occur result procedure . Secondarily , study allow u begin determine effectiveness diminish obstructive symptom associate BPH . Duration investigation The investigation enroll 30 patient , target enrollment period le 12 month . Each patient consent follow-up 5 year , patient reach first important safety endpoint 1 week treatment first clinical efficacy assessment 3 month treatment . Objectives To determine safety effectiveness prostate artery embolization treatment BPH . Description study type This prospective observational non-comparative study initial cohort 30 patient . Study Population The patient recruit urology practice Georgetown University urologists area patient self-referral . The study also announce study website , content approve IRB Georgetown University Medical Center . The primary outcome absence complication bladder , rectum pelvic structure detect first week therapy . Each patient judge free adverse event . For adverse event , complication score use Society Interventional Radiology ( SIR ) definition . Descriptive statistic use summarize event , along patient demographic initial clinical status . Appropriate parametric non-parametric test use assess change laboratory measure , urine flowmetry parameter , score IPSS IIEF . Changes prostate volume estimate volume devascularized tissue calculate patient outcomes different embolics compare . Appropriate pair parametric non-parametric test use determine statistical significance . A p value 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
