	<brief_title>Lung Cancer Information Study ( LCIS-R01 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Appropriate utilization treatment systemic therapy remain problematic advanced lung cancer . A major issue continue over-treatment . Contributors include barrier communication concern patient ' wish goal , lack formal monitoring symptom use validated health-related quality life ( QL ) patient report outcomes ( PROs ) assessment , over-dependence imaging study major often sole assessment tool . All factor make quality decision make difficult lead decisional conflict patient family regret treatment . The primary specific aim test hypothesis use decision aid enhance inform , share decision make couple QL assessment immediate result patient advanced lung cancer receive first , second , third-line therapy lead reduction two major contributor cost ( number chemotherapy cycle administer number advance imaging study [ CT , MRI , PET ] relate treatment decision ) compare control arm . Secondary aim : 1 ) To test hypothesis patient advance lung cancer receive intervention decision aid couple immediate QL-PRO result ) reduce decisional conflict , reduce decisional regret relate decision-making process , ; 2 ) explore hypothesis patient advance lung cancer great agreement choose supporter ( less difference perception QL-PROs patient supporter ) few chemotherapy cycle , close agreement . This phase III , two-arm , prospective , randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) test use decision aid ( `` DecisionKEYS '' ) patient advanced lung cancer couple validate , Electronic Lung Cancer Symptom Scale ( `` eLCSS-QL '' ) provide immediate QL-PRO result treatment period . A repeated measure design obtain QL assessment baseline , every 3 week chemotherapy give , completion chemotherapy . This study use pretest/ posttest design cover time three consequential decision cancer chemotherapy : Decision 1 ( `` Starting Chemotherapy '' ) , Decision 2 ( `` Changing Chemotherapy '' ) , Decision 3 ( `` Stopping Anti-Cancer Treatment '' ) . There three entry point : patient enter trial either initial chemotherapy , time start 1st- , 2nd- 3rd-line chemotherapy . A stratified block randomization design use stratum determine two variable : line therapy presenting quality life . This RCT conduct outpatient set three cancer center three state . The sample include 196 patient advanced non-small cell lung cancer choose supporter ( available ) . The sampling plan include serially screen clinic appointment roster clinic . QL-PRO assessment , decisional conflict , decisional regret use evaluate response decision aid . A specific protocol follow physician study nurse visit . Descriptive statistic , subgroup analysis ( t-test ) , Generalized Linear Model ( GLM ) method use analysis .</detailed_description>
