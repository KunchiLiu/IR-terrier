	<brief_title>CGRP Induced Migraine Attacks Patients With High Low Genetic Load</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine prevalent neurological disorder strong genetic factor . The common form migraine multifactorial polygenic pattern inheritance genetics research crucial deeper understand migraine mechanism . Recently , 12 genetic locus identify associate migraine ( MA ) without aura ( MA ) four large genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) . The functional consequence genetic locus human yet unknown . Calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) neuropeptide play crucial role pathophysiology migraine present migraine relevant structure . CGRP induce migraine attack MO patient via adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) dependent pathway CGRP antagonism efficient treatment migraine attack . Also , recent study show intracellular accumulation cAMP crucial induction migraine attack . However , CGRP cause migraine attack familial hemiplegic migraine ( FHM ) , autosomal dominant subtype MA . The phenotype migraine induce effect CGRP might therefore link 12 genetic susceptibility locus identify . One genetic locus ( rs13208321 ) locate gene ( FHL5 ) associate regulation cAMP-responsive element .</detailed_description>
