	<brief_summary>Vascular risk factor may account 80 % memory thinking problem experience age population today , far excess cause Alzheimer 's disease . By study , hope learn vascular risk factor cause memory thinking change elderly , whether prevent memory thinking change reduce risk factor . Successful completion project aim allow integrate understanding mild cognitive impairment cause vascular risk ( MCI-CVD ) potential tremendous impact one major healthcare crisis face nation today . The study enroll 80 participant memory think problem ( mild cognitive impairment ; MCI ) risk stroke difficulty memory thinking may eventually lead disability diagnosis dementia . Each participant randomize one two group ( 40 group ) follow 36 month . One group follow allow u understand natural history memory think impairment , group receive intensive education assistance vascular risk factor ( CVD ) control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , control study intensive medical management educational programming ( Heart Health Intervention ) control stroke vascular risk may impact think memory ( MCI-CVD ) . This mean choose enroll , determine chance ( pull number hat ) whether receive study intervention standard-of-care treatment . One-half subject enrol intervention , one half . You 50:50 chance receive intervention , like flip coin . You study 36 month enroll . Even study group receive medical management educational program , monitor risk stroke vascular risk every 6 month information provide primary doctor , potentially result increase level care result participation study . You must individual ( spouse , friend , relative ) , call `` study partner '' , willing accompany study visit available telephone communicate change health status period study . The study visit include check vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate weight ) , regular blood test 6 month interval monitor vascular risk ( blood sugar , cholesterol level ) well ensure safety throughout study , yearly brain image MRI scan , optional spinal fluid collection enrollment end study help u understand brain change measure blood .</detailed_description>
