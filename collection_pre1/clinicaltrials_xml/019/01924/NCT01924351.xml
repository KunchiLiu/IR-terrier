Describe natural history neurocognitive function woman brain metastasis treat SRS HER-2 direct systemic therapy establish reference benchmark generate hypothesis future design phase III trial . 2 . Describe pattern distant brain relapse SRS patient compare ( ) patient 1-3 vs. 4-10 brain metastasis ( b ) patient treat systemic therapy regimen 3 . Describe pattern neurologic death 4 . Describe pattern local brain relapse 5 . Describe pattern re-irradiation WBRT SRS 6 . Describe adverse event</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HER2-positive Breast Cancer With Brain Metastasis ( GCC 1345 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metastatic breast cancer lead cause death woman . HER2 ( human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ) -positive disease represent aggressive type breast cancer often afflict young patient . As many one-third patient HER2-positive breast cancer develop brain metastasis [ 1 ] . The development brain metastasis young female population particularly devastate often highly functional may young child . Improvement quality life prevent neurocognitive decline disease progression and/or treatment related side effect paramount . Patients 1-10 brain metastasis HER2+ breast cancer , inform consent , treat : Radiosurgery : Gamma-knife , Cyberknife , linac-based SRS follow anti-HER2 base systemic therapy , treatment selection approve agent physician 's discretion . Possible anti-HER2 agent include trastuzumab , pertuzumab , trastuzumab-emtansine , lapatinib . Anti-HER2 therapy deliver combination appropriate cytotoxic therapy per FDA indication . Anti-HER2 base systemic therapy continue progression , patient discontinuation , unacceptable toxicity , view physician longer indicate . MRI neurocognitive test do prior SRS repeat every 3 month first 6 month enrollment . Patients enrol eligibility criterion meet . The date registration/enrollment consider day Eligibility Checklist sign verify physician . Once patient enrol , unique case number assign patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven diagnosis HER2positive breast cancer . Her2positive define follow : * Validated IHC assay score 3+ ( define uniform , intense stain &gt; 30 % invasive tumor cell ) OR Average HER2 gene copy number &gt; 6 OR Gene amplify ( HER2 : D17Z1 ratio &gt; 2.20 ) . Patients 110 newly diagnose brain metastases The contrastenhancing intraparenchymal brain tumor must well circumscribe must maximum diameter ≤ 4.0 cm direction enhance scan . If multiple lesion present one lesion maximum diameter , ( ) must exceed 3.0 cm maximum diameter . History physical neurological examination , steroid documentation , height , weight within 14 day registration . A diagnostic contrastenhanced MRI brain must perform within 28 day prior registration . Eligibility treatment SRS confirm radiation oncologist . Performance Status 02 Age ≥ 18 . CBC differential obtain within 14 day prior registration , adequate bone marrow function define follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,100 cells/mm3 . Platelets ≥ 75,000 cells/mm3 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥9.0 g/dl acceptable ) . Adequate renal function within 14 day prior registration , define : BUN ≤ 30 mg/dl . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min . Adequate hepatic function within 14 day prior registration , define : Total Bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ALT/AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Systolic blood pressure ≤ 160 mg Hg diastolic pressure ≤ 90 mg Hg within 14 day prior registration . Prothrombin time/international normalize ratio ( PT INR ) &lt; 1.4 patient warfarin confirm test within 14 day prior registration . Patients fulldose anticoagulant ( e.g. , warfarin LMW heparin ) must meet following criterion : No active bleeding pathological condition carry high risk bleeding ( e.g. , tumor involve major vessel know varix ) . Inrange INR ( 2.5 3.5 ) stable dose warfarinbased oral anticoagulant ; stable dose low molecular weight heparin ; INR 1.5 2 Greenfield filter place . Patient must provide study specific informed consent prior study entry . For woman childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior registration . Women childbearing potential male participant must practice adequate contraception . Echocardiogram MUGA scan ejection fraction within normal institution limit within 28 day registration Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free ≥ 3 year . For example , carcinoma situ oral cavity cervix permissible . Leptomeningeal metastases Previous treatment follow : lapatinib , trastuzumab , pertuzumab , trastuzumab emtansine . ( Patients eligible treat 3 less agent . ) Prior cranial radiotherapy . Prior resection cerebral metastasis Allergy gadolinium Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure within last 6 month . Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month . New York Heart Association grade II great congestive heart failure require hospitalization within 12 month prior registration . History stroke , cerebral vascular accident ( CVA ) transient ischemic attack within 6 month . Serious inadequately control cardiac arrhythmia . Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm , history aortic dissection ) clinically significant peripheral vascular disease . Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation intraabdominal abscess , major surgical procedure significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior registration , exception craniotomy tumor resection followon craniotomy manage complication brain tumor management hemorrhage infection . Bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration . Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ; note , however , laboratory test coagulation parameter require entry protocol . Active connective tissue disorder , lupus scleroderma , opinion treat physician may put patient high risk radiation toxicity . Any major medical illness psychiatric impairment investigator 's opinion prevent administration completion protocol therapy . Cognitive impairment precludes patient act agent provide inform consent . Women childbearing potential sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception ; exclusion necessary chemotherapeutic treatment involve study potentially teratogenic . Pregnant lactate woman , due possible adverse effect develop fetus infant due study treatment . Patients treat therapeutic clinical protocol within 30 day prior study entry participation study . Inability undergo MRI ( e.g. , due safety reason , presence pacemaker ) . Inability undergo SRS due claustrophobia</criteria>
