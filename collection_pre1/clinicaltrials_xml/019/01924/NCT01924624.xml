	<brief_summary>Postoperative recurrence hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) major problem surgical resection . To date , adjuvant chemotherapy adjuvant modality proven effective prevent delay recurrence . The aim prospective randomize study evaluate effectiveness Thalidomide postoperative adjuvant regimen inhibit recurrence HCC</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Therapy With Thalidomide After Curative Resection Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number modality prevent HCC recurrence resection propose analyze . Both preoperative adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) find unable reduce risk postoperative recurrence significantly , confer survival advantage . Vitamin K ( VK ) fat-soluble vitamin regulate clot factor production act coenzyme VK dependent carboxylase catalyze carboxylation glutamic acid residue gamma-carboxyglutamic acid . The finding vitro indicate VK2 antiproliferative effect hepatoma cell line , efficacy suppress HCC recurrence confirm human study . Interferon variety biologic property , include antiviral , immunomodulatory , antiproliferative , antiangiogenic tumoricidal effect . It report interferon effective preventing development HCC recurrence curative treatment HCV-related cirrhosis . However , interferon treatment also side-effects , include flu-like symptom , fatigue , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , depression , bone marrow suppression , unmask exacerbation autoimmune illness , lead either treatment disruption dose modification . Polyprenoic acid , acyclic retinoid , reportedly effective prevention second primary hepatoma , long-term safety efficacy data lacking . Thalidomide possess immunomodulatory , anti-inflammatory , antiangiogenic properties.It successfully apply treatment various malignancy include HCC.To investigate whether postoperative adjuvant therapy Thalidomide could inhibite recurrence HCC radical resection , plan conduct clinical trial .</detailed_description>
