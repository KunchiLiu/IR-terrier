	<brief_summary>Colorectal Surgery Preoperative Exercise Training study run colorectal surgery team Norfolk Norwich University Hospital University East Anglia look role exercise surgery improve recovery follow operation . Having operation remove part bowel put physical stress body . We know train help body cope physical stress way athlete train competition . We hypothesise body may recover quickly train prior operation regular simple exercise . Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) use evaluate function lung , heart muscle rest exercise . CPET test often do part standard pre-operative assessment many hospital patient undergo major surgery . Some study demonstrate CPET use predict outcome follow surgery ( time take till discharge , complication rate ) . The study consist two part : Study 1 ) CPET variable predict outcomes surgery - patient undergo CPET test determine baseline fitness . Blood test take around time surgery examine whether biochemical marker bloodstream ( use combination result CPET test ) predict outcome recovery follow colorectal surgery . Patients monitor assess speed recovery rate complication follow surgery . This enable u determine CPET variable combination variable useful prediction post-operative complication follow colorectal surgery . 2 ) The second study consist exercise intervention involve several session supervise exercise laboratory . Before end exercise training regime , CPET measurements take see fitness improve exercise . This part study determine feasible implement structure , supervise exercise programme patient await elective colorectal cancer surgery . The result study used inform large randomise control trial examine influence exercise CPET variable postoperative outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct two part : Part 1 . Study examine ability CPET predict outcomes patient undergo colorectal surgery : Objectives To identify CPET variable combination variable useful prediction post-operative complication follow colorectal surgery . In addition , examine whether CPET variable use combination score system blood test increase accuracy prediction . The aim investigation develop accurate prediction model key clinically relevant predictor variable , include CPET variable , blood test risk score system . Such model could use clinical practice predict pre-operative outcome thus help risk stratify patient post-operative surveillance management . Study Population The Norfolk Norwich University Hospital undertake approximately 300 procedure colorectal cancer per year . Patients schedule cancer surgery recruit trial . Study Outline Informed consent participate trial obtain outpatient set diagnosis/scheduling surgery discussion medical team colorectal nurse specialist . All patient follow standardise peri-operative pathway devise conjunction surgical anaesthetic team . Sample Size A sample size minimum 90 patient identify , base comparable study patient group literature . Predictor Variables Supervised pre-operative CPET test take place exercise laboratory University East Anglia surgery . The test do pedal stationary bicycle , resistance pedal gradually increase , similar cycling hill . As subject ride stationary bike , amount oxygen use , fast/efficiently heart beat calculate . Breathing measure face mask mouth piece electrical activity heart measure via sensor place chest . Each CPET test take around 30 minute complete . For participant part study , one CPET test do prior surgery convenient time . In addition standard pre-surgery blood test NHS patient receive , blood take measure several key serum marker associate post-operative outcome patient undergo major abdominal surgery ( pro-BNP , CRP , albumin IL-6 ) . Scoring system apply patient data additional indicator peri-operative risk - system involve calculate measure risk base co-existing illness patient may . Data Collection Patient note review postoperative day identify postoperative complication accord Post-Operative Morbidity Survey system ( POMS ) , score tool previously use study assess different system body determine 'morbidity ' accord define criterion ( pulmonary , infection , renal , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , wound complication , haematological pain . Time take pain relief satisfactory , ability eat drink , satisfactory level mobility/self-care bowel function also record . Length hospital stay time take patient medically fit discharge also record . Part 2 : Feasibility randomise prehabilitation programme patient undergo surgery colorectal cancer Objectives To determine feasibility implement structure , supervise exercise programme patient await elective colorectal cancer surgery . The result study used inform large randomise control trial examine influence exercise CPET variable postoperative outcome . Study Population ( ) Study Outline Following baseline CPET test assess initial background fitness , patient randomise one two study arm : 1. supervise aerobic exercise training pathway + standard treatment 2. standard treatment without supervised exercise training To adequately assess key feasibility outcome , sample size 60 patient ( 30 arm study ) use . Patients randomise exercise training offer three session supervise aerobic exercise per week subsequent 4 week procedure conduct exercise lab University East Anglia . Each session include simple freehand exercise well time treadmill fix exercise bike . The session last hour tailor individual fitness level . Heart rate , clinical sign , blood pressure perceive exertion record regularly throughout exercise . This exercise protocol currently use study elderly patient bladder cancer await surgery well-tolerated . Repeat CPET test take place 4 week baseline test exercise laboratory ( day prior surgery ) determine change ( ) CPET variable . The patient non-exercise arm study undergo exercise intervention CPET test exercise laboratory time point exercise arm patient . The data patient ( n=30 ) use contribute first part study ( CPET variables predictor outcome ) . All patient CPET test 3 month post-surgery assess well return baseline function follow operation . Patients give follow-up questionnaire time , 6 month post-surgery assess health-related quality life psychological outcome . The questionnaire use : CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire old adult , The Satisfaction Life Scale , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) , FACT-F FACT-C scale ass disease-specific quality life . Data collection : As , patient note review post-operative complication identify . In addition , study assess feasibility conduct trial large scale : identify number eligible patient , recruitment rate , willingness patient randomise , willingness clinician participate trial , compliance/tolerance exercise regimen , patient satisfaction process . In addition , cost undergo CPET test supervised exercise training estimate . An assessment key health outcome also undertake , i.e . change CPET variable follow exercise training , postoperative complication , length stay , health-related quality life benefit , thus enable plan large trial .</detailed_description>
