	<detailed_description>This prospective nonrandomized intervention study involve inpatient admit 6 designate intervention 8 designate control acute medicine division Barnes-Jewish Hospital St Louis , academic teaching hospital Washington University School Medicine , August 2011 December 2011 . The study population consist patient care either control intervention floor receive anti-diabetic medication hospital stay . The study approve Washington University Medical Center institutional review board , include waiver consent patient . The pharmacy informatics system program previously-developed hypoglycemia alert parameter identify patient high risk hypoglycemia base real-time patient information ( 7 ) . Patients identify high risk intervention floor insulin oral anti-hyperglycemic agent prescribe , hypoglycemia informatics-generated risk score great 35 , capillary venous blood glucose level â‰¤90 mg/dL . The risk score 35 value correspond 50 % sensitivity subsequent blood glucose &lt; 60 mg/ dl 75 % sensitivity blood glucose &lt; 40 mg/ dL . Patients assign category base division admit risk score algorithm . The electronic alert send division-specific charge nurse via pager . Fourteen charge nurse intervention division train assess alert , interview patient , identify alternate dose strategy collaborate patient 's physician . These trained nurse available intervention division Monday Friday 0700 1700 . Control patient ( HR- ) identify high risk control division base criterion intervention patient . The control patient ' chart review upon discharge patient certify diabetes nurse educator research team evaluate number hypoglycemic episode patient well physician recognition increase risk whether appropriate change make patient order response low down-trending blood glucose level . Nurses physician care patient study division provide informed consent participate study . Nurses ' satisfaction alert process physician interaction assess collaboration scale complete alert well post study satisfaction scale ( 9 ) . Nurses physician provide informed consent participate .</detailed_description>
