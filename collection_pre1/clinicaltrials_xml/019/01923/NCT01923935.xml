	<detailed_description>Title - A phase 2 , open-label , prospective , multicenter study evaluate efficacy intravenous busulfan melphalan condition regimen patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) undergo autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) Principal Investigator - Je-Jung Lee ( Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital ) Co-investigators - Hyeon Seok Eom ( National Cancer Center ) - Kihyun Kim ( Samsung Medical Center ) - Chang Ki Min ( Seoul St. Mary 's Hospital ) - Soo Jung Kim ( Severance Hospital ) - Sung Soo Yoon ( Seoul National University Hospital ) - Jae Hoon Lee ( Gachon University Gil Hospital ) - Yeung-Chul Mun ( Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital ) Duration - 2 year Study phase - Phase II Patients - Patients multiple myeloma undergo autologous stem cell transplantation Objectives ( end point ) - Primary objective : 1 . Treatment response 2 month ASCT 2 . Safety toxicity ( frequency grade 3 bad toxicity ) condition regimen - Secondary objective : 1 . Progression free survival ( PFS ) 2 . Overall survival ( OS ) Total patient - Initial 105 evaluable patient - Complete Response ( CR ) rate 200mg/m2 melphalan condition chemotherapy follow ASCT patient newly diagnose MM 26 % CR rate busulfan melphalan condition chemotherapy follow ASCT patient newly diagnose MM 40 % . If CR rate busulfan melphalan condition chemotherapy follow ASCT 40 % , combination accept active condition regimen may worth investigate phase III trial . But , CR rate regimen low 26 % , merit 200mg/m2 melphalan condition chemotherapy . Based upon assumption , trial design use Simon 's optimal two-stage test procedure . Assuming target level interest , p1=0.4 , low activity level , p0=0.26 drop rate 0.1 . Initially 44 patient accrue . If 13 CR rate observe , trial continue . Accrual plan total 105 patient , If total 35 patient assessed CR , busulfan melphalan condition regimen accept active regimen , This design provide probability ≤ 0.05 accept drug bad p0 probability ≤ 0.20 reject drug well p1.if assume drop-out rate 10 % , total accrual patient 105 Treatment Schedule - Busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day iv daily 3 hour ( day-6 ~ day-4 ) - Melphalan 70 mg/m2/day iv daily 30 minute ( day-3 ~ day-1 ) . If Creatinine Clearance ( mL/min ) &lt; 50 , reduce 50 mg/m2 . If Creatinine Clearance ( mL/min ) &lt; 30 , exclude trial Informed consent - Written informed consent must obtain study-specific screening procedure perform Screening - Baseline assessment make within 28 day treatment start : 1 . Demographic data ( date birth sex ) 2 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 3 . Vital sign physical examination ( include height , weight ) 4 . Medical history ( include previous diseases/treatments concomitant diseases/ treatment ) 5 . Hematology - complete blood count differential count examination 6 . Serum electrolyte ( Na , K , Cl , Ca , phosphorus ) 7 . Serum lactate dehydrogenase 8 . Hepatitis B virus/hepatitis C virus/HIV serology ( If serologic test conduct within 6 month prior screen , retests require ) 9 . Serum Beta2-microglobulin 10 . Quantitative serum M-protein ( Serum protein electrophoresis ) , include immunofixation immune electrophoresis 11 . Quantitative urine M-protein 24 hr urine ( Urine protein electrophoresis ) , include immunofixation immune electrophoresis 12 . Serum free light chain assay 13 . Creatinine clearance increase serum creatinine 14 . ECG 15. multigated radionuclide angiography 2D ECHO 16 . Chest X-ray , Radiographic skeletal survey include skull , pelvis , vertebral column long bone 17 . Bone marrow aspiration biopsy chromosome study , flow cytometry immunohistochemistry Assessment - Primary outcome measure 1 . To evaluate objective response ASCT , guideline International Myeloma Working ( IMW ) Group uniform response criterion use 2 . Response Criteria Multiple Myeloma guideline IMW Group uniform response criterion + Add criterion near CR ( Immunofixation positive CR ) 3 . Serum free light chain study add every evaluation response 4 . To confirm stringent complete response ( sCR ) ASCT , flow cytometry immunohistochemistry use 5 . NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects version 4.0 use examination toxicity - Secondary outcome measure 1 . PFS define time ASCT time first sign disease progression death 2 . OS define period time ASCT date last follow-up death cause</detailed_description>
