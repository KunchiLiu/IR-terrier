	<brief_summary>There general agreement optimal duration postoperative urinary drainage , relevant literature reporting duration range 1 10 day . The available research support routine use prolong catheterization limited study investigate early removal follow infraperitoneal colorectal surgery largely underpowered form valid practice conclusion . The aim investigator study determine whether postoperative colorectal patient safely indwell catheter remove postoperative day one ( 24 hour follow surgery ) addition study medication ( prazosin ) , without statistically significant difference incidence urinary retention compare standard , accept approach delay removal ( 72 hour postoperatively ) . Patients undergo laparoscopic open pelvic colorectal surgery peritoneal reflection benign malignant condition randomize two group : group one catheter remove postoperative day 3 ( 72 hour postoperatively ) Group 2 dose alpha-blocker prazosin give 6 hour prior catheter removal urinary catheter remove postoperative day 1 ( 24 hour postoperatively ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The available research support routine use prolong catheterization limited study investigate early removal follow infraperitoneal colorectal surgery largely underpowered form valid practice conclusion . In era multimodal recovery algorithm emphasize early diet advancement , ambulation , short hospital length stay , unnecessarily prolong catheterization may interfere many objective . An indwelling urinary catheter interferes early patient mobilization potentially lengthening hospitalization subject patient increase risk urinary tract infection . A study 2,355 consecutive patient undergo primary colorectal cancer resection via laparotomy find overall prevalence postoperative urinary retention 5.5 % , however , patient undergo low pelvic surgery experience almost 16 % incidence urinary retention . Postoperative urinary catheter drainage infraperitoneal colorectal surgery commonly practice , assume degree nerve damage superior hypogastric plexus sacral promontory nervi erigentes pelvic side wall result pelvic dissection , cause transient permanent dysfunction lower urinary tract . It believe intraoperative damage pelvic autonomic nerve may associate early postoperative acute urinary retention , justifies indwell urinary catheter several day follow infraperitoneal pelvic surgery . However , general agreement optimal duration postoperative urinary drainage , relevant literature reporting duration range 1 10 day . Prolonged indwell urinary catheter associate increase risk urinary tract infection , risk bacteriuria 3 10 % per day catheterize , risk urinary tract infection increase 5 % 10 % per catheter day second day catheterization . The incidence urinary tract infection anorectal surgery 5 day catheterization show range 42 % 60 % . Higher mortality rate report hospitalized patient develop urinary tract infection indwell catheterization incidence bacteremia single catheterization report high 8 % . The optimal duration urinary drainage infraperitoneal colorectal surgery unknown . Based autonomic mechanism micturition relation striate muscle fiber external urethral sphincter , alpha blockade study potential intervention reduce incidence re-catheterization . A large Cochrane Database review role five randomize trial , four trial favor alpha blockade placebo . Furthermore , side-effect profile alpha-blockade low compare favorably placebo . Prior study suggest urinary bladder catheter drainage remove postoperative day one follow pelvic surgery may safe decrease incidence urinary tract infection . However , study underpowered detect meaningful conclusion . A large study investigate optimal duration urinary drainage conclude remove catheter one day postoperatively patient undergo infraperitoneal colorectal surgery appropriate , unless low rectal carcinoma present lymph node metastatic disease present . The investigator wish substantiate evidence introduce positive finding associate alpha-blockade minimize need re-catheterization . The investigator therefore propose prospective , control randomize trial compare effect 1 day 's transurethral catheterization infraperitoneal surgery alpha blockade medication compare 3 day catheterization , acute urinary retention primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
