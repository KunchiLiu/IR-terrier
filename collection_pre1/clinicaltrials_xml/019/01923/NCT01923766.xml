	<brief_summary>In study , investigator try see infusion `` m-CTLs '' prevent treat cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) adenovirus ( AdV ) reactivation infection cord blood transplant . Patients blood cell cancer , blood disease genetic disease may receive cord blood transplant ( UCBT ) unrelated donor . After receive cord blood transplant , risk infection new immune system fight infection grow cord blood cell . In study , investigator try give special cell cord blood call T cell . These cell try fight virus cause infection . Investigators test see blood cell donor grow special way , prevent patient get infection . EBV , AdV CMV viruses cause serious life-threatening infection patient weak immune system transplant . T lymphocytes kill viral cell normally enough kill virus infected cell transplant . Some researcher take T cell person 's blood , grown laboratory give back person viral infection bone marrow transplant . Some study show positive therapeutic effect patient receive CTLs ( specially train T cell ) viral infection post-transplant period . In study try prevent treat viral infection give CTLs soon get umbilical cord blood transplant . With study , investigator want see use kind white blood cell call T cell prevent treat AdV , EBV CMV infection . Investigators grow T cell cord blood transplant . These cell train attack adenovirus/EBV/CMV- infected cell call multivirus-specific cytotoxic ( killer ) T-cells `` m-CTL . '' Investigators would plan give patient one dose m-CTL time 30 364 day transplant . They use T cell make way blood donor prevent infection patient get bone marrow blood stem cell transplant first time investigator make cord blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) readily available alternative source Hemotopoietic Stem Cells ( HSCs ) capable reconstitute hematopoiesis myeloablative therapy . More 280,000 UCB unit bank world-wide 13,000 unrelated donor UCB transplantation perform . UCB transplant offer several advantage adult bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplant , include : 1 ) rapid availability , 2 ) absence donor risk , 3 ) low risk transmissible infectious disease , 4 ) low risk acute Graft versus Host Disease ( GvHD ) set Human Leukocye Antigen ( HLA ) mismatch ( compare recipient unrelated donor marrow peripheral blood ) . UCB particularly beneficial patient ethnic racial minority descent adult marrow blood donor often identify . In large series neutrophil engraftment report high 92 % . The incidence acute GvHD report large series range 33-44 % 11-22 % grades II-IV III-IV acute GvHD , respectively . The incidence chronic GvHD range 0-25 % . These result particularly notable since UCB donor-recipient pair 1-2 HLA antigen mismatch . However , infection relate TRMs still concern UCBT . The rate hemopoietic recovery slow UCBT ; therefore infectious complication include viral infection occur frequently . Multi virus Specific T cell Cord Blood could apply comparable success recipient CB transplant ; however , certain obstacle extension approach must circumvent . These include : ( ) limit number CB T-cells available manipulation ( ii ) naivety CB T-cells . Hence , development virus-protective T-cell therapy patient undergo CBT require prim extensive expansion naïve T-cells rather limit simple direct expansion pre-existing virus-specific memory T-cell population virus-experienced donor . Further , CB T-cells low cytotoxic activity high activation-induced cell death peripheral blood T-cells . These limitation prevent production virus-specific cord blood-derived CTL sufficient number clinical use . Because challenge , report document generation antigen-specific T cell CB . Sun et al first report ability generate EBV-specific CD4+ T cell use EBV-transformed B-cells , lymphoblastoid cell line ( LCL ) . Park et al report ability generate CMV-pp65-specific T cell cord blood use CMV-immune complex-loaded DCs , CMV lysate , IL-12 IL-7 . The study Baylor College Medicine ( BCM ) show Ad5f35pp65-transduced CB-derived APC could use generate large number autologous T-cells specific CMV Ad , even phenotypically naive T-cell subpopulation . Addition EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell line ( LCL ) APCs allow Ad/CMV specificity CB T-cells extend EBV . In addition , multivirus-specific T-cells recognize array epitope 2 week expansion vivo . We therefore suggest ability generate virus-specific CTL CB plethora epitope recognize CD4+ CD8+ T-cells minimize risk viral escape maximize therapeutic benefit administration cell cord blood recipient risk severe viral disease . A clinical trial use CB-derived multi-virus specific T cell prevention treatment viral infection CBT start BCM . ( Clinical Trial # : NCT01017705 ) .</detailed_description>
