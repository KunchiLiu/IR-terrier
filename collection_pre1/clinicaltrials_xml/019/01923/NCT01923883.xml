	<detailed_description>EUS-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) safe effective method diagnose pancreatic peripancreatic solid mass . The diagnostic accuracy EUS-FNA report 62-96 % . There two aspiration method obtain specimen EUS needle , application negative-pressure syringe capillary sampling ( without suction ) . The former method think increase cellularity obtain specimen . However , negative-pressure syringe worsen specimen quality increase amount bloody material specimen damage tissue . Blood aspirate dilutes sample make direct smear difficult interpret clot form . Meanwhile , latter method might yield small sample high diagnostic yield decrease amount sanguineous staining . Recently , EUS-guided fine needle biopsy 22-gauge ProCore needle use capillary sample remove stylet slowly 40 sec to-and-fro movement needle ( capillary sampling style slow-pull technique ) pancreas biopsy report provide significantly high tissue adequacy compare half- ( 5 mL ) full suction ( 10 mL ) method animal study . Therefore , perform prospective randomize clinical trial compare diagnostic adequacy accuracy specimen obtain two different aspiration method EUS-FNA : negative-pressure suction syringe ( NPS ) vs. capillary sample stylet slow-pull technique ( CSS ) . The primary end point study evaluate difference diagnostic accuracy two aspiration method . This study prospective randomize clinical trial . The needle use study conventional EUS-FNA needle ( Echotip , Cook Medical , Winston-Salem , NC ) approve FDA Korea Food Drug Administration ( KFDA ) . The procedure perform one endoscopist . The patient undergo EUS-FNA conscious sedation midazolam meperidine . The procedure conventional EUS-FNA except aspiration method . The first aspiration method ( NPS CSS ) assign random number table . After first needle passage , next EUS-FNA do different aspiration method . A total four time needle pass perform patient alternative aspiration method ( i.e. , NPS CSS two time one patient ) . Sample size 1 . We Assumed diagnostic accuracy two aspiration method ( NPS CSS ) equivalent ( 88 % ) non-inferiority margin 10 % . 2 . A two-tailed sample size calculation perform 1 % alpha error attain 80 % power . Using 10 % dropout rate , target sample size 51 ( i.e. , NPS CSS 102 time 51 patient ) . Statistical analyse 1 . Chi-square test - Comparing specimen adequacy 1st needle pas accord aspiration method . 2 . Student 's t-test - Number needle pass optimal specimen accurate diagnosis . 3 . McNemar test - Comparing diagnostic yield accord aspiration method . 4 . Sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , positive negative predictive value .</detailed_description>
