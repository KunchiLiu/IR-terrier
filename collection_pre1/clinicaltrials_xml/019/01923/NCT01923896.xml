	<brief_summary>The propose study represent first attempt systematically investigate use DCS adjunct behavioral intervention address chronic food aversion randomize control drug trial child treat Marcus Autism Center 's Pediatrics Feeding Disorders Program . This pilot feasibility study involve total 16 participant randomly assign experimental condition : behavioral intervention behavioral intervention + DCS ( 8 group ) . All participant receive behavioral protocol involve three treatment session per day ( 45 minute length ) , total 15 session across five consecutive day . In addition , participant behavioral intervention + DCS group receive low dose ( 0.7 mg/kg ) drug use acute dose methodology , demonstrate produce nearly negligible side effect profile comparable treatment outcomes chronic dosing . Timing dose occur 1 hour prior behavioral intervention , line prior clinical study . Study staff , consultation psychiatrist , observe administration DCS participants caregiver via preferred method formula consumption ( bottle , cup , tube ) liquid form . Participants evaluate treatment session follow-up use trained observer collect data mealtime behavior , include acceptance , swallow , disruption , expulsion , gram consume . This type data collection standard practice feed disorder program . It hypothesize participant receive DCS adjunct behavioral intervention show great improvement mealtime behavior reflect measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Extinction fear think use similar learn mechanism learn condition fear , block antagonist glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor . Furthermore , agonists site appear augment form learn animal human trial . The process extinction condition fear initially show facilitate D-Cycloserine ( DCS ) , NMDA agonist , give individual dos prior extinction training animal model . There grow evidence similar effect find human subject undergo controlled exposure therapy specific phobia . This translational research proposal represent randomized-control study goal determine whether drug acutely enhance learn human animal research facilitate extinction fear occur behavioral therapy child food aversion . Specifically , propose single dose DCS , give shortly 5 day behavioral therapy session utilize escape extinction , significantly enhance rate response possibly efficacy treatment pediatric food aversion . To end , investigator propose enroll 16 participant food aversion . Participants randomly assign receive behavioral intervention alone combination 0.7mg/kg DCS . Behavioral rating outcome assess independent assessor blind subject condition . Participants assess pre-treatment one month follow-up session ass long term effect . - This type combine treatment -- specific pharmacotherapeutic augmentation behavioral therapy -- would novel pediatric population food aversion would potentially generalizable many different form behavioral intervention wide range pediatric disorder . The potential detrimental health outcome associate feed disorder , combine complex biopsychosocial etiology , intensifies need identify refine effective treatment . If translational research successful , ability relatively benign agent administer acutely behavioral therapy session facilitate extinction process could important clinical , humanitarian , economic advantage . Specific Aims : The entire propose study design achieve follow specific aim : 1 . To explore whether d-cycloserine ( DCS ) , NMDA partial agonist , facilitate extinction food aversion child use extinction base behavioral intervention . 2 . To explore whether facilitation extinction produce DCS behavioral intervention evidence within session immediately post-treatment result long-term gain treatment response compare behavioral intervention alone . 2.2 Research Hypotheses : The following hypothesis test : 1 . DCS facilitate extinction child . It predict child receive behavioral intervention combine 0.7mg/kg DCS evidence rapid improvement mealtime behavior ( acceptance , swallow , disruption , expulsion , gram consume ) child receive behavioral intervention alone . 2 . Facilitation therapeutic response aid DCS result long-term gain . It predict group patient receive behavioral intervention combine 0.7 mg/kg DCS evidence improvement follow-up assessment compare baseline behavior ( acceptance , swallow , disruption , expulsion , gram consume ) group receive behavioral intervention alone . Gender Minority Participants ' Inclusion Plan . Patients race ethnic group enter , male female . The investigator recruit year long wait list behavioral service Feeding Disorders Program . The investigator advertise via flier Marcus Autism Center , well local pediatric gastroenterological practice Atlanta area . ( See Flyer Info review content flyer ) . The racial composition Atlanta 71 % white , 26 % black , 3 % ( base 1990 US Census ) . Approximately 1 % person Hispanic origin . The gender composition Atlanta 51 % female . This study provide free treatment , thus ensure equal opportunity learn participate study . The treatment set locate racially diverse county ( DeKalb County ) , easily accessible public transportation wheelchair accessible . It therefore expect study sample closely approximate demographic composition Atlanta . Treatment : Behavioral Intervention : Treatment commence follow pre-treatment assessment . Participants randomly assign one two treatment group : behavioral intervention alone behavioral intervention plus medication . All participant treat period 5 consecutive day . A total 3 , 45-minute meal hold regularly schedule time ( e.g. , 9:00 a.m. , 10:30 a.m. , 12:00 p.m. ) day total 15 meal throughout treatment . Trained feed therapist Marcus Autism Center 's Pediatric Feeding Disorders Program conduct session treatment room equip one-way mirror adjacent observation room allow caregiver watch treatment session . Behavioral intervention target severe feed disorder involve combination escape extinction antecedent manipulation food presentation lessen aversive quality meal . This allow treatment address consequence maintain food refusal least restrictive environment ameliorate possible side effect associate extinction procedure . Please refer nonremoval spoon + representation + redistribution ( NRS + REP + RED ) protocol detailed example propose treatment . Data collect meal behavioral treatment session video record purpose ensure accurate protocol implementation assess reliability . Caregivers train protocol last session treatment promote transition protocol home setting . Medication : As described , investigator compare behavioral intervention alone behavioral intervention plus 0.7mg/kg DCS . Patients instructed take medication supervision study personnel one hour prior first treatment session . A placebo also give participant behavior condition use similar method administration . Design Plan : The propose design randomly assign 16 participant food aversion behavioral intervention behavioral intervention plus 0.7mg/kg DCS take acutely one hour prior onset first treatment session day . All participant receive three , 45 minute treatment session per day period five day . Study medication administer clinic supervise study personnel ensure compliance . The investigator use Children 's Healthcare Atlanta Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) provide drug placebo . Participants assess pre-treatment one month follow termination treatment blind independent assessor .</detailed_description>
