	<brief_summary>This study evaluate steady-state pharmacokinetics ( PK ) confirm dose ritonavir ( RTV ) -boosted elvitegravir ( EVG/r ) . This study also evaluate safety , tolerability , antiviral activity elvitegravir ( EVG ) administer background regimen contain ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor ( PI/r ) HIV-1 infect , antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment-experienced pediatric participant . The study consist 2 part : Part A Part B . Part A enroll participant suppress viremia ( HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL ) fail current ARV regimen ( HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL ) evaluate steady state PK confirm dose EVG . Part B enroll participant fail current ARV regimen ( HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL ) evaluate safety , tolerability , antiviral activity EVG .</brief_summary>
