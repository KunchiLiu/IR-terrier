	<brief_title>Irinotecan Alisertib Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate feasibility safety MLN8237 ( alisertib ) give combination irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MLN8237 give combination irinotecan patient advance solid tumor recommend phase II dose combination . II . To obtain preliminary evidence efficacy combination . III . To compare pharmacokinetics SN-38 ( active metabolite irinotecan ) without concurrent administration MLN8237 expand cohort patient advance colorectal cancer . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study alisertib . Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-3 8-10 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
