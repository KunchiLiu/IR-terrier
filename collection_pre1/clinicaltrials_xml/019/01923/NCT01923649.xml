	<brief_title>SOMATULINE Autogel 90 mg IN DUMPING SYNDROME</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dumping syndrome characteristic alimentary systemic manifestation . It one common postprandial syndrome observe extensive gastric surgery . Dumping syndrome separate early late phase depend occurrence symptom relation time elapsed meal . The early phase occur rapid delivery large amount osmotic active solid liquid duodenum . The late phase cause rapid increase glycemia insuline cause hypoglycemia nutrient available . Dumping syndrome direct result alteration storage function stomach and/or pyloric empty mechanism . Incidence severity symptom dump syndrome relate directly extent gastric surgery . An estimated 25-50 % patient undergone gastric surgery symptom dump . Only 1-5 % report severe disabling symptom . Incidence significant dumping report 6-14 % patient truncal vagotomy drainage 14-20 % patient partial gastrectomy . Incidence dump syndrome proximal gastric vagotomy without drainage procedure le 2 % . In pediatric population , dump syndrome describe child undergone Nissen fundoplication . Several treatment propose patient dumping . Initially diet several small meal low concentration mono-and disaccharide prescribe patient ask avoid liquid meal . Several medical treatment utilized guar gum , increase viscosity reduce gastric emptying ; pectine , avoid late hypoglycemia ; acarbose , block digestion saccharide . Some partial effect important side effect . Surgical intervention like interposition antiperistaltic jejunal segment reduce intestinal motility Roux-en-Y construction create . These surgical intervention sometimes necessary remain quite invasive always useful . Somatostatin analogue use success patient dump syndrome . They exert strong inhibitory effect release insulin several gut-derived hormone . The effectiveness analogues control symptom early late dump demonstrate several randomize control trial . Somatostatin analogues interfere pathophysiology dump syndrome several way . Somatostatin analogues reduce secretion insulin prevents occurrence late hypoglycaemia ; decrease concentration different hormone responsible vaso-dilatation activation renin-angiotensine system see early faze dump syndrome . Somatostatin also effect gastric motility transit time . One main problem high cost daily subcutaneous administration somatostatin analogue . Somatuline® Autogel slow-release formulation require monthly injection supply high-dose , stable serum level lanreotide . These agent provide improve patient compliance since administer monthly schedule . The purpose study assess Somatuline autogel 90 mg effective treatment dump syndrome . This 27 week double blind placebo-controlled cross-over multicenter study assess effect Somatuline 90 mg patient dump syndrome . Reports therapeutic effectiveness lanreotide management dumping symptom scarce base small number patient . Data effect lanreotide treatment dump miss . In trial , patient treat Somatuline ® Autogel 90 mg. From pharmacokinetic point view , patient reach steady state concentration lanreotide 12 week treatment . After 12 week , wash-out period 4 week inserted patient cross placebo active treatment week 16 .</detailed_description>
