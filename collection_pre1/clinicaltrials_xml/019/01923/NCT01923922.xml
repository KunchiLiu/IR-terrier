	<detailed_description>Purpose research : Evaluate utility non-invasive image tool compute tomography ( CT ) perfusion preoperative prognostication high grade cerebral glioma . Background information : Brain tumour affect approximately 2300 individual per year Canada . High grade glioma common primary brain tumour adult account approximately 2.5 % cancer death . The real incidence high grade glioma country know , affect approximately 2 per 100,000 people per year Nova Scotia . Non-invasive , accurate timely diagnosis imperative . High grade glioma aggressive neoplasm , median survival affect patient 12 month , irrespective form treatment . The prognosis patient determine pathology biopsy surgery . Conventional image technique magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) alone help predict level malignancy cerebral glioma . Formation new blood vessel play central role growth spread tumour . The advanced imaging tool compute tomography ( CT ) perfusion use study blood supply tumor level capillary . This information permit determination aggressiveness cerebral glioma time diagnosis . To direct well aggressive care patient high grade cerebral glioma , important identify patient whose life expectancy could relatively longer . The two high grade gliomas group together literature treatment prognosis . There study address differentiation two high grade gliomas . Some preliminary study . In preliminary study 20 patient , investigator show CT perfusion predict survival , irrespective pathological grade treatement receive . In present study , investigator would like extend preliminary finding large group patient ensure technique indeed robust . In patient short survival , perfusion parameter may help identify new therapeutic target ( e.g. , anti-angiogenic agent ) may help treatment patient . Both CT MR perfusion study use assess blood supply brain tumor . MR perfusion limit term absolute quantification perfusion parameter due non-linear relationship concentration contrast material signal intensity change . MR perfusion study also require two bolus injection contrast agent . CT perfusion widely available reliable technique give absolute quantification perfusion parameter single acquisition single bolus contrast agent . Hypothesis- CT perfusion high grade cerebral glioma predict survival irrespective pathological grade irrespective treatment give . Specific objective : Conduct prospective study large cohort patient high grade cerebral glioma ass utility CT perfusion compare demographic factor , tumour grade treatment estimate prognosis . Research design : This prospective cohort study do period 2 year QE II Health Sciences Centre , Infirmary Site . All patient , present newly detect brain lesion likely high grade cerebral glioma either CT MRI brain , ask participate study . Pregnant patient impaired renal function exclude study . Informed consent obtain . Approximately 100 new patient cerebral glioma present brain tumour clinic every year . Our intent recruit least 50 patient high grade cerebral glioma year 2 consecutive year . Each patient undergo single CT perfusion scan undergoing biopsy surgical resection . CT perfusion technique- The CT perfusion scan perform 128 slice multi-detector CT scanner ( Somatom Definition Flash , Siemens ) . CT perfusion image performed time routine preoperative neuronavigation imaging . A non-contrast CT head scan acquire localize tumour obtain perfusion scan . Four 5 mm thick slice matrix size 512x512 select level tumour . Multiple image acquire level start 5 sec injection 50 cc non-ionic iodinated contrast medium ( Omnipaque 300 ) rate 4 cc/sec . The acquisition parameter 80 kVp 100 mA . The image acquire every second total 110 sec . The image send separate post-processing work station post- processing perform use CT perfusion software ( Siemens ) . Two CT perfusion parameter ( cerebral blood volume permeability surface area product ) calculate use multiple region interest area tumour show high perfusion value . Another region interest place contralateral normal look white matter . The patient undergo biopsy surgery histopathological examination tissue per standard care hospital . The perfusion parameter correlate grade glioma pathology . The patient receive adjuvant treatment per institutional standard care follow clinically per standard care . The perfusion parameter correlate survival patient . Data analysis- Perfusion parameter compare glioma normal brain tissue different grade gliomas use Student 2-sample test . A Cox regression analysis proportional hazard use determine relationship overall survival perfusion parameter . Kaplan-Meier survival curve draw demonstrate relationship perfusion parameter overall survival patient . A p value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Expectations Relevance propose research - CT perfusion help preoperative characterization high grade cerebral glioma level aggressiveness . - Perfusion parameter help predict prognosis ( irrespective grade tumour treatment give ) patient high grade cerebral glioma . This may help target aggressive therapy patient predict long survival . - In patient predicted short survival , perfusion parameter may direct future research new therapeutic target . Possible pitfall possible solution : 1 . Radiation exposure CT perfusion- These patient undergo radiotherapy part treatment , significantly high radiation dose compare CT perfusion . Radiation dose CT perfusion equivalent 2 head CT scan . 2 . Potential kidney toxicity iodinate dye- Only 50 cc CT dye use , small compare regular dose enhance CT scan . Patients compromise renal function exclude study .</detailed_description>
