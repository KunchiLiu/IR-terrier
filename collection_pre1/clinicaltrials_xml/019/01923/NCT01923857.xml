	<criteria>Subjects Impaired Renal Function : Subjects various stage impair renal function must meet follow inclusion criterion screen consider admission study : 1 . Speak , read , understand English Spanish willing able provide write informed consent Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve form prior initiation study procedure ; 2 . Male , age 18 80 year Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 25 42 , inclusive , preferred . 3 . Subjects must meet criterion mildly ( creatinine clearance 5080 mL/min ) moderately ( creatinine clearance 3050 mL/min ) impair renal function . The Investigator assess renal impairment category subject . Substantiation diagnosis must indicate source document ; ( See Appendix B ) 4 . Subjects must evidence stable renal impairment determine Investigator ( See Section 9.3.2 , Day 1 ) 5 . If medication treatment complication renal disease , concomitant chronic illness , subject must take medication stable dose least 10 day prior first Androxal dosing date continue dose duration study . The medication must record source document ; 6 . Subject willing remain clinic screen visit ( approximately 1 day screen visit ) treatment visit ( approximately 3 day ) ; 7 . Nonsmokers prefer , restricted population light moderate smoking allow ( 10 cigarettes/day ) ; 8 . Must able swallow gelatin capsule ; Subjects Normal Renal Function : Healthy volunteer meet follow inclusion criterion screen consider admission study : 1 .
