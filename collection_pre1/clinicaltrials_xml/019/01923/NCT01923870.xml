Hepatic impairment determine Investigator . Substantiation diagnosis must indicate source document ; Subjects must evidence stable hepatic impairment determine Investigator . Stability define change Class determination ( A , B , C ) base ChildPugh criterion assess screen visit prior first dosing ; If medication treatment complication liver disease , concomitant chronic illness , subject must take medication stable dose least 10 day prior first dose date continue dose duration study .
