	<brief_summary>Intraoperative blood glucose concentration abnormality associate increase perioperative morbidity mortality ( 1-4 ) . Severe intraoperative hyperglycemia ( BGC ≥ 200 mg/dl ) patient undergo craniotomy urgent/emergent craniotomy traumatic brain injury complicate 15 % case associate high in-hospital mortality . Intraoperative use dexamethasone craniotomy also know induce increase blood glucose concentration . The importance blood glucose concentration neurosurgical patient witnessed effect tight blood glucose control incidence infection neurological outcome . Currently available evidence suggest , neurosurgical patient , perioperative BGC value within 80-180 mg/dl range . Data prevalence severe intraoperative hyper ( blood glucose concentration &gt; 180 mg/dl ) hypoglycemia ( blood glucose concentration &lt; 80 mg/dl ) patient undergo craniotomy supra infratentorial surgery elective emergency procedure lack know whether patient intraoperative severe hyperglycemia relates increase incidence postoperative infection unknown . Aim prospective observational study -in patient undergo craniotomy supra infratentorial surgery elective emergency procedure- test hypothesis severe intraoperative hyperglycemia ( blood glucose concentration ≥180mg/dl ) associate increased incidence infection within first postoperative week ( pneumonia , sepsis , urinary wound cerebral infection ) . We also record prevalence severe intraoperative hyper hypoglycemia ( blood glucose concentration &lt; 80 mg/dl ) recruit patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>METHODS Study Design This prospective observational cohort study , adult patient underwent craniotomy supra infratentorial surgery elective emergency procedure , approve University Rome `` Sapienza '' , Policlinico Umberto I hospital , Institutional Review Board ( 2665 , 28/3/2013 ) . Recruited patient categorize accord type procedure 4 group : primary brain tumor ( gliomas meningioma ) ; metastatic tumor ; neurovascular lesion ( intracranial hemorrhage , subarachnoid hemorrhage , arterovenous malformation ) ; traumatic brain injury ( 14-16 ) . In group `` elective '' `` emergency '' procedure record apart . Because observational study design , perioperative clinical management run attend anesthesiologist . Standard care guideline include use insulin infusion full nutritional supply provide . Patients population Adults ≥18 year age , underwent elective emergency craniotomy brain lesion supra infratentorial space prospectively recruit . In patient intraoperative blood glucose concentration measure twice : beginning procedure ( immediately endotracheal intubation ) end surgery ( immediately extubation ) arterial whole blood blood gas analysis ( Instrumentation Laboratory , BGA analyzer GEM 4000 , UK ) . Patients one BGC &gt; 180 mg/dl categorize `` severe intraoperative hyperglycemia '' . Intraoperative Setting All patient receive normal saline ( NaCl 0.9 % ) pre intraoperative fluid infusion . There fix protocol anesthetic management anesthetic regime determine attend anesthesiologist . Anesthesia maintain either halogenated inhalational anaesthetic ( desflurane sevoflurane ) continuous propofol infusion fentanyl per clinical need . Intraoperative monitoring accomplish 3 lead ECG , SpO2 , end tidal CO2 , invasive arterial pressure , core body temperature urine output . Patients normoventilated ( PaCO2 35-40 mmHg ) mild hyperventilation use facilitate brain relaxation necessary . There dedicate protocol treatment intraoperative hyperglycemia intraoperative insulin use discourage unless attend anesthesiologist consider necessary . Recorded demographic clinical characteristic include : age , gender , localization brain lesion ( supra infratentorial ) , type surgery ( primary brain tumor , metastatic brain tumor , neurovascular , traumatic brain ) , set surgery ( elective emergent ) , duration surgery , history diabetes mellitus ( use chronic oral hypoglycemic agent insulin ) , associate cardiac , vascular , renal hepatic morbidity intraoperative use mannitol steroid . In postoperative period , patient keep fast first 24 hour , subsequently full calorie load -by self alimentation enteral/parenteral nutrition- warrant . As per local protocol , postoperative period , insulin administer patient blood glucose concentration &gt; 180 mg/dl . Definitions Hyperglycemia define BGC ≥ 180 mg/dL . Hypoglycemia define glucose≤ 80 mg/dL . Postoperative infection ( pneumonia , blood stream-sepsis , urinary , surgical site/wound cerebral infection ) diagnose accord Center Disease Control Prevention criterion within 7 day surgery . The onset type infection determine 2 consultant infective disease . Outcomes The primary outcome prevalence postoperative infection normoglycemic patient present one intraoperative blood glucose concentration ≥ 180 mg/dL . Secondary outcome measure : incidence severe intraoperative hyper ( blood glucose concentration ≥180 mg/dL ) hypo ( blood glucose concentration &lt; 80 mg/dL ) glycemia patient undergone craniotomy ; relationship set surgery ( elective emergency ) , history diabetes mellitus intraoperative use mannitol steroid severe intraoperative hyperglycemia . Statistical Analysis For sample size calculation , hypothesize incidence post operative infection would 30 % high patient severe intraoperative hyperglycemia . We estimate 28 patient recruit study group detect 30 % difference incidence postoperative infection . A difference incidence intraoperative hypo hyper glycemia different subgroup patient undergone craniotomy calculate use Chi square test .</detailed_description>
