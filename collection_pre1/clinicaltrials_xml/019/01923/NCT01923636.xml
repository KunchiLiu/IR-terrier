	<detailed_description>Infection cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) frequent cause congenital neurological handicap infectious origin industrialized country . Around 10 % infected neonate symptoms 50 % develop long term neurological sequelae sensorineural hearing loss . Among asymptomatic infect neonate 10 15 % ultimately develop hearing loss . To establish prognosis infected neonate remain difficult purpose study well define early prognosis factor . The true burden CMV congenital infection unknown France : prevalence infection well description epidemiology ( proportion symptomatic asymptomatic case , rate long term sequela , proportion case follow primary secondary maternal infection ) unknown .</detailed_description>
