	<brief_summary>The purpose study improve performance neuroprosthesis stand SCI develop test new advanced method use multiple contact peripheral nerve electrode slow onset fatigue increase stand duration . The new advanced method take advantage ability multiple-contact nerve cuff electrodes selectively activate portion muscle perform action . Alternating activation multiple muscle ( part muscle ) rather continuously activation entire muscle group constantly allow rest recover fatigue contraction . This allow user remain upright long period time perform activity daily live , reduce risk fall due fatigue , increase potential receive health benefit stand .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Neuroprosthesis Prolonged Standing After SCI Using Multi-Contact Peripheral Nerve Electrodes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroprostheses stand SCI currently rely continuous activation hip knee extensor muscle , result rapid fatigue ultimately compromise elapse stand time . The primary objective study improve performance neuroprostheses stand develop implement advanced stimulation paradigm use multi-contact peripheral nerve electrode delay fatigue onset prolong stand duration . The new stimulation paradigm take advantage ability multi-contact nerve cuff electrodes selectively activate independent portion muscle , independent muscle perform action . Such capability allow one muscle ( part muscle ) rest others continue contract keep knee extend user upright . Stimulation waveform alternate activation multiple muscle perform function , rather continuously activate entire muscle group constantly , allow muscle rest recover fatiguing contraction . In addition important clinical benefit , project also high impact significance method develop specific single electrode technology stimulation system . Any clinical therapeutic application require sustain muscular contraction production constant joint torque prolong period time benefit successful completion project .</detailed_description>
