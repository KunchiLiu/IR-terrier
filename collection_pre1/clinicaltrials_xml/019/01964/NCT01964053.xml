	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) among prevalent chronic condition lead cause hospital readmission adult 65 year age old . HF patient discharge rural critical access hospital ( CAHs ) high 30-day readmission rate compare patient discharge urban hospital . Adhering recommend self-management behavior improve HF patient ' health outcome reduce readmission ; however , prevalence adherence low HF patient . In rural community , low adherence attribute fact rural HF patient receive less information manage chronic condition base investigator preliminary study . Previous study report inconsistent finding regard effectiveness intervention design improve self-management adherence . The feasibility intervention rural setting unknown . Therefore , innovative program need identify intervention enhance self-management adherence HF patient live rural community . The purpose prospective , two-group , repeated measure , randomize control trial test efficacy feasibility 12-week activation-enhancing intervention ( Patient AcTivated Care Home [ PATCH ] ) self-management adherence health outcome ( readmission rate ) HF patient discharge rural hospital ( critical access hospital ) . A sample size 96 subject heart failure recruit 14 month period . Both intervention control group receive usual care . The intervention group additionally receive 2-phase PATCH intervention : in-hospital discharge education session ( Phase I ) 12-week post-discharge education session deliver telephone ( Phase II ) . The tailored strategy develop activate patient engage self-management behavior base baseline activation level . The investigator central hypothesis , base upon preliminary data , patient high activation level significantly well self-management adherence . The investigator test hypothesis follow Specific Aims : To evaluate effect patient activation intervention self-management adherence ( Aim 1 ) hospital readmission ( Aim 2 ) time . To evaluate mechanism patient activation intervention ( Aim 3 ) . To evaluate feasibility PATCH intervention ( Aim 4 ) . The PATCH intervention innovative : 1 ) translate patient activation theory intervention strategy improve self-management vulnerable population ( rural heart failure patient live rural community ) , 2 ) test mechanism patient activation self-management adherence ; 3 ) use rural nursing theory guide develop sustainable intervention program rural community ; 4 ) evaluate biomarker collect single urine test indicator self-management adherence HF patient . This study impact management heart failure add knowledge mechanism improve self-management adherence heart failure patient living rural community . Long term adherence recommend self-management behavior foundation realize health benefit reduce burden patient , family healthcare system .</detailed_description>
