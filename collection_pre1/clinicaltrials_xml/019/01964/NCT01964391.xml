	<brief_summary>This Phase IIIb , open-label , multinational , multicenter study evaluate participant 's satisfaction safety subcutaneously administer trastuzumab participant HER2-positive early breast cancer . Participants receive trastuzumab 600 milligram ( mg ) administer subcutaneously every 3 week adjuvant neo-adjuvant plus adjuvant set 18 cycle ( 1 year ) , unless disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur . The trastuzumab regimen could include mono- and/or combination therapy .</brief_summary>
