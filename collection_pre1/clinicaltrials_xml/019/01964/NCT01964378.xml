	<brief_title>CORAL - Cebranopadol Versus Morphine Prolonged-release Patients With Chronic Moderate Severe Pain Related Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial comprise enrollment period , treatment period ( titration maintenance ) , follow-up period . Participants receive either cebranopadol morphine 44 day . Initially participant titrate 2 every 4 day morphine cebranopadol dose provide adequate analgesia tolerate . The titration period plan last 16 day . Thereafter dose morphine prolong release cebranopadol keep stable 28 day , i.e . dose adjustment allow maintenance period . This 28 day period maintenance period . The follow-up period plan 18 day end last pain medication treatment intake .</detailed_description>
