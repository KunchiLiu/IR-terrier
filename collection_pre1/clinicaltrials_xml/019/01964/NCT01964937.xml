	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Five Different Combinations HIV Vaccines Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety , tolerability , immune response five different combination three HIV vaccines—a DNA vaccine ( DNA-HIV-PT123 ) , NYVAC vaccine ( NYVAC-HIV-PT1 NYVAC-HIV-PT4 injection ) , AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine—in healthy , HIV-uninfected adult participant . The study enroll 180 healthy , HIV-uninfected participant age 18 50 year . The participant randomly assign one five group . All participant receive injection accord assign group schedule study entry ( Month 0 ) Months 1 , 3 , 6 . The immune response different prime boost vaccine strategy test Groups 1 4 , immune response co-administration DNA AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine test Group 5 . Group 1 participant receive AIDSVAX® B/E prime follow NYVAC boost ; Group 2 participant receive NYVAC prime follow AIDSVAX® B/E boost ; Group 3 participant receive AIDSVAX® B/E prime follow DNA boost ; Group 4 participant receive DNA prime follow AIDSVAX® B/E boost ; Group 5 participant receive DNA AIDSVAX® B/E vaccines 4 vaccination visit . Total study duration approximately 42 month involve 12 month schedule clinic visit screen , study entry [ Month 0 ] , Months 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 3 , 3.5 , 6 , 6.5 , 9 , 12 ) follow annual health contact via e-mail phone total 3 year follow initial study injection . All study visit include physical exam , HIV risk reduction counseling , interview and/or questionnaire . Select study visit include blood collection , urine collection , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , pregnancy test participant bear female . For participant Groups 1 2 , select study visit also include assessment cardiac symptom . Participants remain clinic 30 minute receive vaccine observation monitoring . For 7 day receive vaccine , participant record symptom report study researcher .</detailed_description>
