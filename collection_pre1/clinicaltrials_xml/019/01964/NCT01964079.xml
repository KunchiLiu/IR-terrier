	<brief_summary>Blood pressure ( BP ) believe major determinant vascular disease , BP lower important goal hypertension treatment . Thus , clinical guideline hypertension mainly focus lower mean BP . However , despite increase incidence stroke age , association systolic BP ( SBP ) risk stroke decrease age . This disparity highlight gap link BP vascular-related disease ( i.e. , stroke ) . In clinical practice , visit-to-visit fluctuation BP largely ignore think unreliable finding , even though phenomenon frequently observe . Rothwell et al . demonstrate visit-to-visit variability SBP powerful independent predictor stroke mean SBP , increase residual variability SBP treat hypertensive patient also strong predictor stroke coronary event . Recently update ( 2011 ) hypertension guideline National Institute Health Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) recommend angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEi ) [ angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) ] calcium-channel blocker ( CCB ) first line drug . Although significance BP variability ( BPV ) illustrate , main focus current guideline reduce systolic diastolic BP , BPV . In X-CELLENT study , CCB ( amlodipine ) thiazide-like diuretic drug ( indapamide sustained-release ) lead significant reduction BPV , compare ARB ( candesartan ) . In addition , CCB show effective reduction systolic BPV among antihypertensive drug class meta-analysis . However , direct comparison study CCB ARB BPV . Thus , aim compare systolic BPV effect CCB versus ARB essential hypertensive patient . The primary hypothesis ARB inferior CCB reduction systolic BPV standard deviation ( SD ) essential hypertensive patient .</brief_summary>
