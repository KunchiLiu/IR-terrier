	<brief_summary>The treatment HCV ( hepatitis C virus ) infection make significant progress past decade therapy combine pegylated interferon ( Peg-IFN ) ribavirin ( RBV ) . The cure HCV infection consist obtain sustained virological response ( SVR ) ( undetectable HCV RNA 24 week end treatment ) reach 50 % patient infected HCV . However , rate much low , around 30 40 % HIV-HCV co-infected patient sometimes less 20 % patient infected HCV genotype 1 . Haemolytic anemia dose-limiting adverse effect occur frequently RBV therapy . RBV-induced anemia represent main cause treatment discontinuation dose reduction RBV , thus limit chance achieve SVR . RBV large inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability relationship occurrence anemia RBV concentration clearly demonstrate . However , factor , include genetic factor , could predictive hematotoxicity and/or well efficiency . In particular , IL-28B polymorphism analysis , patient infect HCV genotype 1 , start antiviral therapy could predict response treatment ( positive predictive value ) . The genetic polymorphism inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase ( ITPA ) also strongly associate protective effect towards RBV-induced-anemia . But data issue study perform Japanese HCV mono-infected population treat Peg-IFN-RBV therapy causal variant rs1127354 . Only study report literature caucasian HIV-HCV co-infected patient . Moreover , data RBV plasma exposure scarce study show impact ITPA polymorphism occurrence anemia . In addition , others polymorphisms SCL29A1/A2 SCL28A2/A3 cod RBV transporter , ENT ( equilibrative nucleoside transporter ) et CNT ( concentrative nucleoside transporter ) would associate either rapid virological response anemia HCV infect patient treat Peg-IFN plus RBV . No study consider polymorphism ITPA , IL-28B , SCL29A1/A2 SCL28A2/A3 gene RBV plasma exposure data far conduct HIV-HCV co-infected patient . Thus , would interest first time assess impact ITPA polymorphism RBV plasma exposure protective effect towards RBV-induced anemia HIV-HCV co-infected patient . This study could helpful literature possible RBV dose adjustment accord ITPA activity . Then , would relevant complete data assess genetic polymorphism IL-28B , SCL29A1/A2 SCL28A2/A3 thus evaluate overall pharmacogenetic relationship towards RBV-induced anaemia and/or virological response Peg-IFN/RBV therapy .</brief_summary>
