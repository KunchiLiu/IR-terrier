	<brief_summary>This research study conduct develop brain control medical device , call brain-machine interface . The device provide people spinal cord injury ability control external device computer cursor robotic limb use thought along sensory feedback . Development brain-machine interface difficult currently limit technology exist area neuroscience . Other study show people high spinal cord injury still intact brain area capable plan movement grasp , able execute movement plan . The device study involve implant fine record electrode area brain know create arm movement plan provide hand grasp information sense feeling hand finger . These movement grasp plan would normally send region brain execute actual movement . By tie pathway send movement plan signal computer instead , investigator translate movement plan actual movement computer cursor robotic limb . A key part study electrically stimulate brain introduce small amount electrical current electrode sensory area brain . This result sensation touch hand and/or finger . This stimulation brain occur robotic limb touch object , thereby allow brain `` feel '' robotic arm touching . The device use study call Neuroport Array surgically implant brain . This device implantation procedure experimental mean approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . One Neuroport Array consist small grid electrode implant brain tissue small cable run electrode grid small hourglass-shaped pedestal . This pedestal design attached skull protrude scalp allow connection computer equipment . The top portion pedestal protective cover place pedestal use . The top pedestal protective cover visible outside head . Three Neuroport Arrays pedestal implant study three protective cover visible outside head . It possible cover expose portion device hat scarf . The investigator hope learn safe effective Neuroport array plus stimulation control computer generate image real world object , robotic arm , use imagined movement arm hand .</brief_summary>
