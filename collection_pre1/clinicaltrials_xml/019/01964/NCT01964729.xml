	<brief_title>rTMS Effects Neuromodulation Pain Threshold Chronic Myofascial Pain Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 30 % world population suffers pain . These data demonstrate great need research focus finding contribute development effectivetreatments patient chronic pain syndromesThe chronic pain occur various mean , either physical psychological injury . Above , whatever history , installation due mechanism neuroplasticity , case non-functional , call maladaptive plasticity . This process symptoms associate chronic pain cause treatment challenge health professional . To obtain positive result , necessary modulate aspect involve processing pain , include functional retraining . This study randomize , blind , parallel medical trial , placebo-sham- control carry int Clinical Research Outpatient Clinic Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre ( HCPA ) , female , age 19 65 year , limited ability perform active routine activity due MPS previous 3 month . We test hypothesis repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) would effective placebo-sham treatment chronic MPS pain score , cortical excitability parameter , function cortical-spinal modulatory system ( CSMS ) , sleep quality serum BDNF.The participant randomize placebo-sham rTMS treatment group 10 consecutive session , 10 Hz frequency . To assessment use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , Brazilian Profile Chronic Pain : Screen ( B-PCP : S ) , quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) , TMS parameter , ( motor-evoked potential ( MEP ) , intracortical facilitation ( ICF ) ) serum BDNF . Through , data prompt u investigate whether rTMS use therapeutic option short long term MPS . In context , test hypothesis rTMS would effective placebo-sham treatment chronic MPS determine disability . We also teste whether rTMS would change induced change electrophysiological marker LTP-like phenomenon level BDNF . Additionally , ass whether treatment induce change cortical-spinal modulatory system , well effect would associate inhibition facilitation . Finally , test whether rTMS would effective placebo-sham improve sleep quality .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Will include study female literate patient , chronic myofascial pain craniomandibular complex ( duration longer 3 month ) . Must submit least one ( 1 ) myofascial trigger point pain restriction neck mobility , skull face / shoulder girdle , time evaluation . Also , patient report verbally pain / discomfort mean score great equal 30 mm , least 7 consecutive day pretreatment , measure visual analog scale ( VAS ) ( score range 0 100 mm ) . Will exclude study patient neurological deficit , systemic disease unbalance , fibromyalgia , chronic inflammatory disease . Moreover , use steroid .</criteria>
