	<brief_summary>This proposal evaluate reliability validity Vanderbilt ADHD screen tool use adolescent young adult age 13-21 year . The Vanderbilt previously develop , freely available set parent- teacher-report questionnaire design identify ADHD related disorder child . The Vanderbilt measure choose inclusion new computerize Integrated Clinical Information Sharing System ( ICISS ) roll five Boston Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) departments/divisions ( Adolescent/Young Adult Practice , Children 's Hospital Primary Care Center , Developmental Medicine Center , Department Neurology , Department Psychiatry ) . The Vanderbilt develop validate use among child age 12 year ( Wolraich et al. , 2003 ; Wolraich et al. , 2013 ; Bard et al. , 2013 ) , little known appropriateness use among old youth . In addition , self-report version Vanderbilt administer directly adolescent young adult ( age 13-21 year ) , parent teacher often less knowledgeable reporter . To address shortcoming , multidisciplinary team BCH adolescent health clinician researcher modify parent teacher Vanderbilt questionnaire make age-appropriate adolescent young adult create complementary self-report version adolescent young adult . The goal current study 1 ) ass feasibility acceptability online administration ICISS system new parent , teacher , youth self-report Vanderbilt measure among adolescent young adult BCH patient age 13-21 year ; 2 ) test reliability term internal consistency reliability , temporal stability responses one-month test-retest , inter-rater agreement across informant ( parent , teacher , youth ) ; 3 ) test validity evaluate convergence similar set ADHD screening tool , Conners scale , already validate use adolescent young adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Initial Validation Vanderbilt ADHD Measure Adolescent Patients ICISS Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Specific Aims : Study Design : We use ICISS system 's capacity prospective ongoing collection data enrol patient family conduct prospective , longitudinal study consist baseline assessment enrollment ICISS , one-month re-test assessment , follow-up assessment either 3 month patient newly-diagnosed ADHD change medication , 6 month patient establish diagnosis medication change . Recruitment Consent : Once patient enrol ICISS , ask wish participate modify Vanderbilt validation study , initially phone call . Some patient and/or parent want discuss person may reach phone call , case research assistant meet clinic visit . This take place quiet , confidential space . However , adolescent typical parent present clinic visit . The Vanderbilt validation study discuss parent verbally phone consent implicit answer two Conners questionnaire send online . Interested eligible patient remind email participation research study completely voluntary , decision participate affect medical care way may withdraw study time . As participation study consist simply answer two Conners questionnaire represent standard care ADHD nationally clinic , present virtually risk participant minimal risk associate general ICISS study , parent , participant teacher option simply respond email request Conners completion study . Data Collection Measures : The increase effort collect additional data need study small measure already collect part large ICISS implementation . The added time participant complete Conners measure marginal , order 30 minute total interaction . After enrollment ICISS , eligible patient age 13-21 year ask complete baseline youth self-report Vanderbilt-Long Form questionnaire parent Parent version . In addition , patient 13-18 year teachers complete Teacher version . All Long-Form version include 18 item assess frequency ( use response scale 0=Never , 1=Occasionally , 2=Often , 3=Very often ) symptom behavior indicative predominant subtype ADHD ( Inattentive , Hyperactive/Impulsive , Combined ) . Additionally , three version screen Anxiety/Depression ( 7 item ) Oppositional-Defiant Disorder ( 8 item ) , disorder often co-occur ADHD . Lastly , Parent Teacher version include item assess Conduct Disorder School Performance ( e.g. , academic performance , peer relation , classroom behavior , assignment completion ) . To assess test-retest reliability , administer Long-Forms one-month follow-up . However , subsequent follow-up ( i.e. , 3- 6-months ) , administer Short-Form three Vanderbilt measure , Long-Form omission Anxiety/Depression Oppositional-Defiant disorder item . We also collect follow data address study aim : Aim 1 : Feasibility Acceptability : We record patient , parent , teacher response completion rate Vanderbilt administration . We also measure length time take complete Long Form ( administer baseline one-month follow-up ) Short Form ( administer monthly thereafter ) , provide comment field describe difficulty may answer question . Aim 2 : Test-Retest Inter-Rater Reliability : All patient , parent , teacher receive respective Long-Form version Vanderbilt one-month follow-up . As part ICISS system , receive email prompt complete form submit electronically ICISS make available team patient 's clinician . We examine test-retest patient new medication change medication stable symptom intervene month . We use follow two item identify patient : 1 ) `` Since your/your child 's last medical appointment Adolescent Practice , change your/his/her ADHD-related medication therapy ? '' ( Yes , No , I/My child do/does receive ADHD-related medication therapy ) ; 2 ) `` In general , would describe your/your child 's ADHD symptom since your/his/her last medical appointment Adolescent Practice ? '' ( They improve , They stay , They get bad ) . We include patient parent patient report indicate change symptoms medications/therapies . We examine item-level retest agreement well reliability overall screening outcome within Vanderbilt domain ( e.g. , whether criterion meet ADHD [ predominant subtype ] , Oppositional-Defiant Disorder , Anxiety/Depression , etc. ) . We also examine , data available , level `` inter-rater '' agreement , domain level , across screen result obtain youth , parent , teacher form . Aim 3 : Concurrent Known-Groups Validity : For patient ages 13-18 year , administer concurrent Vanderbilt assessment time point ( see Study Design ) , Conners 3rd Edition Self Report Scale - Short Form ( 39 item ) ; Parent Rating Scale ( 43 item ) ; Teacher Rating Scale ( 39 item ) . For patient age 19-21 yr , administer Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale Self-Report - Screening Version ( 30 item ) , ask parent complete correspond Observer Report - Screening Version ( 30 item ) ( Erhardt et al , 1999 ; Van Voorhees et al. , 2011 ) . We opt use adult ADHD rating scale patient age 19 year old since Conners 3rd Edition measure validate age 18 year . We also opt drop teacher-based assessment patient older 18 year due concern many teacher would unable ass participant give minimal personal interaction college class participant 's possible desire keep ADHD diagnosis private . To test ability Vanderbilt score differentiate adolescent expect differ ( known-groups validity ) , administer 1 ) modify version Clinical Global Impression Scale [ CGIS ] , single-item measure adolescent global functioning ( Busner &amp; Targum , 2007 ) parent youth complete ; 2 ) among patient 13-18 year , PedsQL-Family Impact Module ( Varni et al. , 2004 ) 36-item parent-report measure impact child 's health condition parent/family quality life ; among patient 19-21 year , 29-item Adult ADHD Quality Life Questionnaire ( AAQoL ) ( Matza et al. , 2007 ) . We use quality life function measure categorize youth low , medium , high symptom-severity group , assess ability Vanderbilt measure discriminate group . Finally , identify patient experience change score validation measure ( Conners , CGIS , PedsQL-Family Impact Module ) follow-up period ( 3 month newly-diagnosed medication-change patient , 6 month established/no-medication-change patient ) assess Vanderbilt 's ability detect change .</detailed_description>
