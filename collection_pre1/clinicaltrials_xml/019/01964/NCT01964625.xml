	<brief_summary>Graft versus Host Disease ( GvHD ) , acute chronic form , major intrinsic complication allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplant ( allo-HSCT ) . Moreover , chronic GvHD may regard `` late effect '' cancer therapy , severity chronic GvHD chief determinant long-term survival follow allo-HSCT . Unfortunately , investigator understand ( thus management ) chronic GvHD optimal ; recent NIH Consensus Conference define inadequacy virtually facets chronic GvHD management . Notably study , lack suitable biomarkers compromise diagnosis , stag therapeutic response evaluation chronic GvHD - also hinder well understand biology process . In particular , activity chronic GvHD often difficult discern , potentially cause either undertreatment , risk morbidity and/or mortality due uncontrolled chronic GvHD , possibly overtreatment , potent ISTs cause unnecessary toxicity . Obviously , development reliable biomarkers chronic GvHD activity would useful advance address problem , well facets management address due certain limitation , detailed herein . Potentially , certain imaging technology could address problem . To date , image technology use sporadically chronic GvHD integral part routine assessment . However , despite nonspecific nature , certain `` inflammatory '' feature chronic GvHD case , plus clinical similarity certain autoimmune disease functional imaging test research trial - ( perhaps notably ) , limited experience acute GvHD - investigator postulate Positron emission tomography - compute tomography ( PET-CT ) scan may useful biomarker disease activity chronic GvHD . This protocol initial effort end .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( +/ DLI ) As per current recommendation , interval allo HSCT require differentiate acute chronic Graft versus Host Disease ( GvHD ) Patients must negative routine restaging PETCT scan Patients may two week ' specific treatment chronic GvHD . ( It recognize patient develop chronic GvHD immunosuppressive prophylaxis ; patient remain eligible , even dose adjustment prophylactic agent occur . The `` two week '' interval pertains use additional agent case . ) Diagnosis chronic GvHD must confirm . In usual case , tissue biopsy require ; however , chronic GvHD patient require tissue biopsy confirmation . The PI coinvestigator must agree eligibility . Per patient approval PI one additional coinvestigator Informed consent Patients malignancy remission exclude . Negative routine pregnancy test . Patients either pregnant unwilling use satisfactory contraception ( appropriate ) eligible . All female patient must use highly effective birth control method combination 2 additionally effective birth control method study . Examples highly effective birth control : condom diaphragm spermicidal jelly , oral , injectable , implanted birth control , abstinence .</criteria>
