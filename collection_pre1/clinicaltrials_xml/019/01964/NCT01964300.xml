	<brief_title>Peginterferon Alfa-2b Treating Younger Patients With Craniopharyngioma That Recurrent Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 1-year disease stabilization rate associate use Sylatron ( peginterferon alfa-2b ) patient progressive unresectable recurrent craniopharyngiomas follow surgery alone receive radiation therapy . II . To estimate sustained objective response rate ( partial response [ PR ] + complete response [ CR ] ) Sylatron patient craniopharyngiomas progress recur follow radiation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate response rate patient progressive unresectable recurrent craniopharyngioma treat Sylatron study stratum . II . To estimate progression-free survival distribution patient unresectable recurrent craniopharyngiomas treat Sylatron study stratum . III . To evaluate toxicity profile Sylatron child unresectable recurrent craniopharyngiomas . IV . To compare protocol specific disease assessment criterion MacDonald criterion first year treatment stratum I time objective response progressive disease stratum . V. To characterize evidence WNT pathway activation immunohistochemistry MAPK pathway activation pyrosequencing resect tumor tissue patient craniopharyngiomas , correlate result outcome response data . OUTLINE : Patients receive peginterferon alfa-2b subcutaneously ( SC ) weekly 6 week . Treatment may repeat every 6 week 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
