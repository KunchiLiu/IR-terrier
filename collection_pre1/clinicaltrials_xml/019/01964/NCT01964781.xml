	<brief_title>The Effect Topical Administration Common Drugs Postoperative Bleeding Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug study whether reduce bleed adrenaline ( constricts blood vessel ) tranexamic acid ( TXA ) ( prevents bloodclots dissolve ) . The drug study extent reduces pain bupivacaine , common local anaesthetic . Patients undergoing bilateral symmetric breast surgery single side mastectomy candidate enrollment study . The bilateral patient two identical procedure hence two identical wound patient . This enable investigator use one side control hence design study arm prospective placebo-controlled . The patient undergoing one-sided procedure need compare similar patient , wound different sizes different people , large group need find significant difference treatment control .</detailed_description>
