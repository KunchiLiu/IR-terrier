	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well trametinib v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( Akt ) inhibitor GSK2141795 work treat patient triple-negative breast cancer ( breast cancer cell estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , large amount human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [ HER2/neu ] protein ) spread place body . Trametinib Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib Akt Inhibitor GSK2141795 Treating Patients With Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess anti-tumor activity associate trametinib monotherapy patient triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess anti-tumor activity associate trametinib combination AKT inhibitor GSK2141795 progression trametinib patient metastatic TNBC . II . To determine progression-free survival follow initiation treatment trametinib monotherapy patient metastatic TNBC . III . To determine progression-free survival follow initiation treatment trametinib combination GSK2141795 patient metastatic TNBC . IV . To determine overall survival follow initiation treatment trametinib GSK214179 patient metastatic TNBC . V. To determine nature degree toxicity associate trametinib monotherapy trametinib combination GSK2141795 patient metastatic TNBC . VI . To determine biomarker potential phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) predict response single agent trametinib . VII . To determine molecular marker sensitivity resistance trametinib monotherapy trametinib combination GSK2141795 patient metastatic TNBC . OUTLINE : PART 1 : Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience disease progression continue Part 2 . PART 2 : Patients receive trametinib Part 1 also receive Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 52 week .</detailed_description>
