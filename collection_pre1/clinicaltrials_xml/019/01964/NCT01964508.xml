	<brief_summary>Thyroid cancer common endocrine malignancy incidence rapidly increase . Palpable thyroid nodule common , affect 5 % general population . Nevertheless , 5 % thyroid nodule harbor malignancy , hence obvious need accurately characterize nodule . Ultrasound guide fine needle aspiration biopsy ( FNAB ) important tool assess nature thyroid nodule , however , 30 % biopsy result indeterminate . In proposal , hypothesize leftover cell FNAB needle may utilize molecular analysis establish microRNA panel distinguish malignant benign lesion . Despite establish study diagnostic utility microRNAs thyroid nodule , effect microRNAs specific target gene involve thyroid cancer poorly study . In proposal hypothesize microRNAs identify panel affect intracellular pathway regulate target gene involve thyroid tumorigenesis . We present preliminary data confirms microRNA panel may identify malignancy thyroid nodule . In aim 1 identify expression profile miRNAs different thyroid cancer . We statistically quantify threshold miRNA dysregulation malignancy large number tumor benign sample . This serve matrix define malignancy FNAB sample . In aim 2 establish reliable reproducible method extract RNA cell leave FNAB sample . Our preliminary data support feasibility method describe previously . This first study compare cytology result microRNA panel analysis FNAB cell . It mimic exact clinical scenario microRNA panel utilized future . Finally , aim 3 characterize effect microRNAs target gene expression . We identify possible target gene bioinformatics database perform quantitative measurement mRNA level target gene real time PCR immunohistochemistry . These study hopefully support utility microRNAs diagnostic tool accurately identify malignancy thyroid FNAB leftover cell point possible target gene future therapeutic approach . This could impact many patient , thyroid cancer 5th common cancer woman , rapidly grow malignancy men woman .</brief_summary>
