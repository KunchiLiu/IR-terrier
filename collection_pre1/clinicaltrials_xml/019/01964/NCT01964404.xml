This study involve 8 group 25 participant . Groups 1-3 diagnosis schizophrenia cannabis use disorder ; Group 4 schizophrenia , Groups 5-7 cannabis use disorder Group 8 healthy control participant . Following screen baseline neuropsychiatric testing , participant two test day ( T1 T2 ) include task-based functional MRI , include assessment rest state connectivity , measure number parameter include reward responsiveness , mood , crave , symptoms cognition . The assessment T1 virtually group . At T2 Groups 1-3 , Groups 5-7 randomly assign one follow condition prior assessment : receive 15mg dronabinol smoke placebo marijuana cigarette , receive placebo pill smoke real marijuana cigarette , receive placebo pill smoke placebo marijuana cigarette . Group 4 Group 8 receive drug placebo T2 . Participants receive drug safety assessment drug administer , drug administer leave research clinic day , week later .</brief_summary>
