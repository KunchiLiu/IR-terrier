	<detailed_description>There increase evidence show inflammation implicate pathogenesis numerous chronic condition cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Also , high-fat meal show induce postprandial oxidative stress inflammation . Polyphenols compound find ubiquitously plant know regulate many process like plant growth , reproduction , seed germination well resistance pathogen predator . They present fruit vegetable exhibit favorable physiological effect even remain fully understood , still allow classification phenolic compound antiinflammatory molecule . Resveratrol polyphenol find berry , grape red wine among others . Interest resveratrol health-promoting molecule flourish recent year show prevent co-morbidities associate diabetes CVD . Evidence physiological benefit resveratrol human somewhat limit , nonetheless support antiinflammatory action . There also increase body evidence support role curcumin , polyphenol curcuminoid family , modulator inflammatory pathway.These observation underline anti-inflammatory potential curcumin may serve prevention treatment chronic condition like diabetes CVD . The general objective project investigate acute effect consume dietary supplement combine resveratrol curcumin inflammatory response follow consumption high-fat meal healthy individual slightly elevate waist girth .</detailed_description>
