	<brief_title>Improving Anticoagulant Therapy Through Warfarin Metabolite Profiling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coumadin ( R/S-warfarin ) commonly prescribe anticoagulant 20 million Americans treatment atrial fibrillation , mechanical heart valve , venous thromboembolism coagulopathies . While highly efficacious , warfarin treatment challenge due narrow therapeutic range high inter-individual variation response . Optimal warfarin dosage relies potentially lengthy trial-and-error process optimize dosage desire anticoagulant response measure international normalization ratio ( INR ) , prothrombin test . Even maintenance dose achieve , patient prone test target INR range , thus risk hemorrhaging ( over-dosing ) thromboembolism ( under-dosing ) . In fact , warfarin among top ten drug-related cause serious adverse drug event increase health care cost . The progressive increase warfarin use necessitate well understand mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability response anticoagulant therapy . Our long-term goal identify metabolic biomarkers correlate clinical response warfarin therapy utilize knowledge predict safe effective dosing patient base single blood draw . Therapeutic outcome patient involve balance warfarin dose metabolism maintain stable target INR . There initial lengthy titration stage dose increase achieve surpass target INR range . The potency effect depend warfarin metabolism , counter dose effect patient inactivate drug . Warfarin undergoes extensive metabolism distinct enantio- regio-specific metabolic pathway yield complex array essentially inactive isomeric metabolite . Warfarin clinically available equal mixture R S enantiomer . S-Warfarin four time potent R-warfarin , presumably dominate anticoagulant response therapy . During maintenance dosing , long metabolic half-life R-warfarin lead high accumulation level plasma observe S-warfarin . Variations R-and S-warfarin plasma level may potentiate anticoagulant effect drug isomer correspond response therapy . For exploratory study , identify biomarkers within patient metabolic profile R-and S-warfarin predict clinical outcome patient .</detailed_description>
