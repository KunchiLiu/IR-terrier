	<brief_summary>ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase constitutive kinase activity . ROS1 previously discover cell line ROS1 fuse protein act driver oncogene . In 2007 , Rikova et al report ROS1 fusion driver mutation NSCLC cell line ( HCC78 ; SLC34A2-ROS1 ) NSCLC patient ( CD74-ROS1 ) . Li et al also find 1 % sample harbor CD74-ROS1 fusion 202 resect lung adenocarcinoma never smoker . The incidence high 10 % East Asian population . Currently least 13 ROS1 fusion variant involve 8 fusion partner ( CD74- , SLC34A2- , FIG- , TPM3- , SDC4- , LRIG3- , ERZ- , KDERL2- ) identify ROS1 positive NSCLC . LDK378 orally highly selective potent ALK kinase inhibitor . In preclinical study , LDK378 much low IC50 value crizotinib cell line engineer express ROS1 rearrangement ( 0.15 nM versus 3 nM ) approximately 20-fold potent . LDK378 potent inhibitor tumor growth rodent model ALCL NSCLC . We suggest phase II trial LDK378 advance non-small cell lung cancer patient ROS1 rearrangement . The aim current trial evaluate antitumor efficacy safety profile LDK378 identify biomarker predict tumor response LDK378 .</brief_summary>
