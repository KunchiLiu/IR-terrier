	<detailed_description>In Denmark , approximately 4400 elective benign hysterectomy annually . In 10 % occur per- postoperative bleeding complication increase hospital stay , reoperations prolong sick leave result . The pharmaceutical product 'Tranexamic acid ' prove effective reduce blood loss form surgery , trauma patient , relation certain medical condition . The hypothesis propose study Tranexamic acid could also reduce operative bleeding associate hysterectomy benign indication .

The clinical trial conduct randomized , placebo-controlled , double blind multicenter trial gynecological department several place Denmark : Nordsjællands Hospital , Rigshospitalet , Odense University Hospital Aarhus University Hospital - Skejby . The subject recruit outpatient clinic gynecological department . During study ongoing monitor external partner . The experiment approve relevant body . The total period time trial plan last one year commence 01.02.3013 end 28.02.2014 . All together trial include 314 participant determine presumed bleeding reduction , average bleed hysterectomy type 1 error 0.05 type 2 error 0.20 . Randomization conduct electronically clinician , patient data collector blind . Data study partly collect registration already well establish well function Danish Hysterectomy Hysteroscopy Database . Data use relation study validate examine manual record conjunction data extraction . The result analyze univariate multivariate analyze static regression analyzes . All final result study sought publish recognize international journal . Regarding ethical aspect note study carry high standard design , proven drug without unexpected side effect disadvantage . In literature , seem evidence suspect increase risk blood clot formation use drug . However , seem clear incidence complication associate hysterectomy quite high . It therefore ethically fully responsible appropriate carry plan study desire ensure quality improve hysterectomy , surgery .
