	<brief_summary>Neurosurgical ICU patient often receive hyperosmotic diuretic cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) drainage decrease intracranial pressure . It also common keep normovolemia mild hypervolemia status stable cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) . These patient large urine output average , decrease reabsorption specific medicine renal tubule . Besides , hypervolemia status might increase volume distribution hydrophilic medicine , low serum concentration . Therefore , pharmacokinetic characteristic population may different general population , impact efficacy toxicity medicine narrow therapeutic index . Vancomycin use mainly MRSA ( methicillin-resistant S. aureus ) infection , possess significant place therapy treatment neurosurgical patient ' post-operation infection . The serum concentration vancomycin exhibit clear relevance efficacy toxicity . From investigator ' preliminary research disposition vancomycin neurosurgical ICU patient , investigator find vancomycin serum concentration lower expect , attribute 40 % high mean vancomycin clearance neurosurgical general ward patient . However , definite mechanism lead phenomenon confirm . In study , investigator prospectively recruit cohort adult neurosurgical ICU patient validate investigator ' preliminary pharmacokinetic parameter model vancomycin . Furthermore , investigator also demonstrate contribution different vancomycin elimination route , renal CSF drainage eliminate rout , total clearance , relationship vancomycin renal clearance creatinine clearance . Exclusion criterion include renal failure , unstable renal function , obesity , shock status , third space fluid accumulation , burn pregnancy . The model validate use empirical vancomycin dosage calculation . Therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) conduct vancomycin serum concentration achieves steady state , predict observed serum concentration vancomycin compare evaluate consistency . On hand , vancomycin excrete urine CSF drainage fluid would calculate see independent contribution total vancomycin clearance . Meanwhile , investigator try investigate mechanism renal elimination vancomycin association creatinine clearance value calculate urine creatinine concentration data . Bringing information together , investigator hope provide helpful information clinical pharmacokinetics vancomycin therapy neurosurgical patient , optimize empirical vancomycin dose improve treatment success . Through study , investigator also wish understand possible pharmacokinetic change medicine population , provide important source reference clinical treatment .</brief_summary>
