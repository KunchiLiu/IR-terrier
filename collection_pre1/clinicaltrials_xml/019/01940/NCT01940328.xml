	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate lung Doppler signal leave HF patient without pulmonary congestion ( i.e . decompensated leave HF patient compensate left HF patient respectively ) , comparison control group subject without CHF ( non-CHF control ) , order determine diagnostic value non-invasive method CHF . If method prove diagnostic value , could potentially use diagnose monitor CHF patient inpatient outpatient setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurements Doppler Signals Noninvasively From Lung Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Participants A total 150 patient recruit study span 18 month . Patients divide 3 subgroup : 1 . Acute decompensated left heart failure- Patients eligible enrollment present emergency department within previous hour acute pulmonary congestion pulmonary edema , diagnose basis follow criterion : 1 . Dyspnea rest minimal activity 2 . Rales auscultation 3 . Evidence pulmonary congestion edema chest X-ray . 4 . BNP level &gt; 400 pg/ml This subgroup recruit emergency medicine department ( EMD ) follow initial treatment stabilization . 2 . Compensated leave heart failure - Patients significant stable leave HF ( NYHA II-III ) optimal medical treatment CHF without clinical laboratory evidence pulmonary congestion ( i.e . patient without dyspnea rest , without rale auscultation BNP level &lt; 100 pg/ml ) . This subgroup recruit among inpatient and/or outpatient Rambam campus . 3 . Non-CHF control ( patient without CHF without uncontrolled hypertension ) . This subgroup recruit among inpatient and/or outpatient Rambam health care campus . Study measurement For compensated leave HF patient non-CHF control , measurement do follow inclusion . For decompensated leave HF patient , several measurement conduct , follow inclusion ( EMD ) day hospitalization ( internal medicine department ) . Measurements follow inclusion : Following informed consent apply inclusion exclusion criterion , eligible patient undergo physical examination include weight , vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , O2 saturation pulse oximetry ) full assessment CHF status physical examination ( lung auscultation , assessment leg edema , weight , JVP etc. ) . ( See figure 2 ) . An ECG recording perform blood test BNP drawn patient . For assessment dyspnea , decompensated leave HF patient ask indicate level dyspnea visual analogue scale ( 3 ) and/or 7-points categorical Likert scale ( 4 ) . Chest X-ray : Decompensated patient undergo chest X ray ( CXR ) part regular evaluation EMD . The 2 subgroup undergo CXR recent CXR ( &lt; 6 month ) available , clinically indicate . Echocardiography : attempt make perform echocardiography EMD decompensated patient sinus rhythm , include full diastolic assessment . However , due limited availability echocardiography service , patient undergo echo EMD therefore examination consider optional . A recent ( &lt; 6 month ) echocardiography require 2 subgroup . If recent echo available , new one do close possible inclusion . Lung Doppler signal record sit position select location right chest wall . If subject unable sit chair , headrest patient 's bed tilt upwards 45 degree . Regarding decompensated leave HF patient , first measurement LDS take place soon possible admission emergency medicine department , provide patient adequately treat stabilized willing able sign inform consent form . The LDS measurement repeat twice EMD 1 hour interval . LDS record compensated patient non-CHF control . Follow measurement hospitalization ( decompensated patient ) During hospital stay internal medicine department , decompensated leave HF patient repeat part former study measurement .</detailed_description>
