	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether transcutaneous sacral nerve stimulation ( TENS SNS ) versus percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) effective therapeutic option subject idiopathic overactive bladder ( OAB ) fail conventional therapy . Our primary hypothesis TENS therapy effective treatment option due ease use improve subject compliance form therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Nerve Stimulation Overactive Bladder Comparison Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare long-term efficacy , subject compliance , subject satisfaction percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) therapy versus transcutaneous electrical sacral nerve stimulation ( TENS ) treatment subject idiopathic overactive bladder . Previous short-term study suggest therapy equal efficacy improve OAB symptom , hypothesize long-term efficacy success actually high TENS group due ease use , since subject self-administer therapy . Secondary goal evaluate subject quality life improvement score , bladder diary score ( change frequency urination ) , change urodynamic study undergo therapy .</detailed_description>
