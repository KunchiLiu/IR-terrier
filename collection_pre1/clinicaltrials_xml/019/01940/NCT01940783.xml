	<brief_summary>One contribute factor variability outcomes amongst Cochlear Implant ( CI ) recipient report placement electrode array scala tympani . It seem correct placement electrode initially scala tympani subsequent avoidance dislocation scala vestibuli insertion progress , key factor achieve good speech perception outcome . Another important aspect relate performance achievement consistent electrical coverage electrode . Data report electrodes different manufacturer give depth range 240 - 600 degree show considerable variation across subject . The HiFocus mid scala electrode develop cover one quarter turn pre-curved design less susceptible variation individual cochlea dimension insertion technique . A mechanical feature pre-curved design avoidance force cochlear lateral wall associate low susceptibility electrode move cochlea follow insertion . Recently , cone beam CT ( CBCT ) technique explore field ENT potential overcome issue associate conventional CT technique scatter , radiation low isometric resolution . Images comparable detail e.g . micro CTs possible much low radiation dose . Modern image software i.e . 3D Slicer ( www.slicer.org ) may use 3D reconstruction , post processing Brainsfit registration . Registration alignment two scan coordinate system . This enable identification difference two image record time x . Once accurately superimpose difference two image may identify accuracy 0.2 mm . Using method , one ass stability position electrode cochlea . Objective : The primary objective study evaluate feasibility use cone beam CT technique combination ( high resolution ) MRI identify electrode movement follow cochlear implant surgery identify inter-scalar position HFms electrode . The secondary objective quantify average insertion depth variation HFms electrode</brief_summary>
