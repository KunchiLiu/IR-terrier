	<brief_summary>This research study try determine safe dose Brentuximab Vedotin give patient chronic GVHD see chronic GVHD improves .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Brentuximab Vedotin Refractory Chronic Graft-vs.-Host Disease ( GVHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study look high dose Brentuximab Vedotin administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect patient chronic Graft v . Host Disease , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose patient get depend number participant enrol study prior well tolerated dos . Each patient receive dose Brentuximab Vedotin every 3 week . Brentuximab Vedotin administer via intravenous infusion , IV infusion , mean directly vein , period 30 minute . Each cycle 21 day long . Each patient undergo follow test procedure come clinic receive dose Brentuximab Vedotin : Days 1 , 8 , 15 1st 2 cycle : - Physical exam , include height , weight , body surface area vital sign . - A medical history , include question health , current medication , allergy . - Performance status , evaluate participant able carry usual activity . - Routine blood test test overall health ( 1 teaspoon blood ) Assessment side effects- physician evaluate patient 's current health ask question see experienced side effect take study drug . Only Day 1 1st 3 cycle : - Research blood draw biomarker PK assessment ( pharmacokinetic assessment measure level drug patient 's blood ) ( 4 teaspoon blood ) - Biomarker study blood draw ( 4 teaspoon ) Viral monitor blood test make sure patient develop new virus result treatment ( 4 teaspoon blood ) - Chronic GVHD assessment : The patient 's physician may need perform test confirm diagnosis acute GVHD . These include blood test , image study , possibly biopsy affect organ . The exact test determine patient 's physician Planned Follow-up : If patient 's physician believe patient respond well treatment , patient may receive 16 cycle Brentuximab Vedotin . The Investigator would like keep track patient 's medical condition 12 month patient complete first 2 cycle treatment , matter patient receive dos . The Investigator would like call patient telephone see he/she . Keeping touch patient check condition help Investigator look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recipients allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) either myeloablative reduced intensity conditioning regimen . Any donor source stem cell eligible . Participants must least 100 day HCT . Patients must steroid refractory cGVHD , define persistent sign symptom chronic GVHD ( section 13.1 ) despite use prednisone ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day ( 0.5 mg/kg every day ) least 4 week precede 12 month ( equivalent dose alternate corticosteroid ) without complete resolution sign symptom . Stable dose corticosteroid 4 week prior enrollment No addition subtraction immunosuppressive medication ( e.g. , calcineurin inhibitor , sirolimus , mycophenolate mofetil ) 4 week prior enrollment . The dose immunosuppressive medicine may adjust base therapeutic range drug Serum Cr ≤ 3 gm / dL Adequate hepatic function ( total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl , AST &lt; 5x ULN ) , unless hepatic dysfunction manifestation presume cGVHD . For patient abnormal LFTs sole manifestation active cGVHD , document cGVHD liver biopsy require prior enrollment . Abnormal LFTs context active cGVHD involve organ system may also permit treat physician document abnormal LFTs consistent active hepatic cGVHD , liver biopsy mandate situation . Patients must adequate bone marrow function define ANC ≥ 1000 / µl platelets ≥ 20,000 / µl without growth factor transfusional support Negative pregnancy test females child bear age Age ≥ 18 The safety effectiveness brentuximab vedotin establish pediatric population . Clinical trial brentuximab vedotin include 9 pediatric patient number sufficient determine whether respond differently adult patient . The effect brentuximab vedotin develop human fetus unknown . For reason chemotherapy agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Ongoing prednisone requirement &gt; 1 mg/kg/day ( equivalent ) Exposure new immunosuppressive medication 4 week prior enrollment . ECP therapy within 4 week prior enrollment Active malignant disease relapse Active , uncontrolled infection Uncontrolled cardiac angina symptomatic congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) . Karnofsky performance status &lt; 30 Prior use brentuximab vedotin GVHD allow . Prior use brentuximab vedotn treatment malignancy allow . Pregnant woman exclude study brentuximab vedotin chemotherapy agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother brentuximab vedotin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated brentuximab vedotin .</criteria>
