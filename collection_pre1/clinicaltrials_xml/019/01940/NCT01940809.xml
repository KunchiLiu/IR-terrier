	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I trial study side effect best way give ipilimumab without dabrafenib , trametinib and/or nivolumab treat patient melanoma spread part body ( metastatic ) remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab nivolumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Dabrafenib trametinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether ipilimumab work well without dabrafenib , trametinib , and/or nivolumab treat melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab With Without Dabrafenib , Trametinib , and/or Nivolumab Treating Patients With Melanoma That Is Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability ipilimumab ( part 1 ) ipilimumab plus nivolumab ( part 2 ) follow lead-in v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 ( BRAF ) mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor , either alone combination , patient BRAFV600 mutant melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ipilimumab ( part 1 ) ipilimumab plus nivolumab ( part 2 ) BRAF MEK inhibitor , either alone combination , compare prior kinase inhibitor treatment . II . To determine safety tolerability dabrafenib trametinib combination set prior ipilimumab alone ipilimumab preceded BRAF MEK inhibitor , either alone combination ( part 1 ) . III . To determine safety tolerability dabrafenib trametinib combination set prior ipilimumab plus nivolumab without prior BRAF/MEK inhibition ipilimumab plus nivolumab precede BRAF MEK inhibitor , either alone combination ( part 2 ) . IV . To determine response rate dabrafenib trametinib set prior ipilimumab alone ipilimumab preceded BRAF MEK inhibitor , either alone combination ( part 1 ) . V. To determine response rate dabrafenib trametinib set prior ipilimumab plus nivolumab without prior MEK/BRAF inhibition prior ipilimumab plus nivolumab precede BRAF/MEK inhibitor ( part 2 ) . VI . To obtain peripheral blood tumor tissue biomarker analysis . VII . To describe immune impact kinase inhibitor therapy immune response associate ipilimumab treatment ( part 1 ) ipilimumab plus nivolumab treatment ( part 2 ) . VIII . To observe record anti-tumor activity . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm Part 2 ( Part 1 close accrual 8/25/2015 ) . PART 1 : ( Closed accrual 8/25/2015 ) ARM A1 : Patients receive dabrafenib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) trametinib PO daily ( QD ) 25 day . Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute . Treatment ipilimumab repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B1 : Patients receive trametinib PO QD 25 day . Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute . Treatment ipilimumab repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM C1 : Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID 25 day . Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute . Treatment ipilimumab repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM D1 : Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART 2 : ARM A2 : Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID trametinib PO QD 25 day follow nivolumab IV 60 minute ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 3 week 4 dos , follow nivolumab monotherapy IV every 2 week continuously 42 course . ARM B2 : Patients receive trametinib PO QD 25 day follow nivolumab IV 60 minute ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 3 week 4 dos , follow nivolumab monotherapy IV every 2 week continuously 42 course . ARM C2 : Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID 25 day follow nivolumab IV 60 minute ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 3 week 4 dos , follow nivolumab monotherapy IV every 2 week continuously 42 course . ARM D2 : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 3 week 4 dos , follow nivolumab monotherapy IV every 2 week continuously 42 course . After 12 week treatment ipilimumab , ipilimumab nivolumab follow nivolumab monotherapy , patient may continue receive dabrafenib PO BID trametinib PO QD absence disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow 14 week .</detailed_description>
