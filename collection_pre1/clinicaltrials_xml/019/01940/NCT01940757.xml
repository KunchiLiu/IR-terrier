	<brief_summary>An experimental hookworm infection model develop provide early proof-of-concept hookworm vaccine target blood-feeding pathway adult hookworm feasible efficacious . The propose model consist vaccinate healthy , hookworm-naïve adult candidate hookworm vaccine , follow challenging investigational product , Necator americanus Larval Inoculum assess effect vaccination infection . The first propose study feasibility study consist administer different dos Necator americanus Larval Inoculum healthy adult volunteer determine optimal dose ( i.e. , number infectious larva ) safe , well-tolerated result consistent infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Experimental Infection Hookworm-naïve Adults With Dermally-applied Infectious Necator Americanus Hookworm Larvae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label , dose-escalation clinical study healthy , hookworm-naïve adult : - Study site : George Washington Medical Faculty Associates , Washington , DC - Number participant : 30 3 cohort 10 volunteer In Cohort 1 , ten ( 10 ) volunteer receive inoculum 25 infectious Necator americanus larva . In Cohort 2 , ten ( 10 ) volunteer receive inoculum 50 infectious Necator americanus larva . In optional Cohort 3 , ten ( 10 ) volunteer receive inoculum 75 infectious Necator americanus larva . The cohort enrol staggered fashion safety data assess prior larval dose escalation . Cohort 2 inoculate earlier 8 week last volunteer inoculate Cohort 1 . The optional Cohort 3 inoculate sooner 8 week last volunteer inoculate Cohort 2 . Cohort 3 enrolled tolerability experimental infection Cohort 2 acceptable result significant adverse event . Within cohort , Study Day 70 , Study Day 77 , 5 volunteer undergo capsule endoscopy order visualize count adult N. americanus hookworm reside intestine . Informed consent capsule endoscopy obtain separately primary study , agreement refusal impact subject 's eligibility enroll continue participation primary study . Three month larval administration , time study withdrawal , participant receive 3-dose treatment albendazole ( 400 mg per dose ) clearance experimental infection . - Larval inoculum schedule : Study Day 0 ( single application ) - Route : apply intact skin volar aspect forearm - Doses N. americanus Larval Inoculum test : 25 , 50 75 infectious larva ( high dose optional ) - Study duration : 6 month per study participant ; total duration study estimate approximately 13 month - Anthelmintic treatment : 3 month post larval inoculum , study withdrawal , 3-dose treatment 400 mg albendazole</detailed_description>
