	<brief_summary>The goal study determine use tranexamic acid , safe effective antifibrinolytic , patient intertrochanteric hip fracture result reduction blood transfusion rate . Treatment administer pre-operatively well time surgical incision . The primary outcome need blood transfusion . Secondary outcome include calculate perioperative blood loss , length stay , cost inpatient care , rate adverse event , include DVT , PE , infection , MI , cerebrovascular event , need re-hospitalization re-operation 30 day mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Tranexamic Acid Transfusion Rates Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient meet specified criterion recruit enrollment study . Informed consent obtain patient health care proxy upon diagnosis intertrochanteric hip fracture on-call orthopedic resident research coordinator . At time , patient randomize one two cohort ( Figure 1 ) hospital 's Investigational Pharmacy use computer generate randomization allocation concealment . The Investigational Pharmacy also responsible storage , preparation distribution tranexamic acid placebo injection . The two patient group include : 1 . 1g intra-venous tranexamic acid upon presentation emergency department time surgical incision . 2 . Placebo injection upon presentation emergency department time surgical incision . Both patient treat surgeon blind regard placebo vs. treatment completion study . All patient treat surgically long trochanteric femoral nail ( TFN ) . Blood transfusion criterion remain consistent hospital standard ( Hb &lt; 8 g/dL symptomatic anemia ) determine independent , blind medical team follow patient throughout hospital stay . Total number blood transfusion receive documented upon patient discharge . All patient permit weight bear tolerate post-operatively deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) prophylaxis standardize : subcutaneous heparin , 5000 unit every 8 hour begin upon admission 12 hour prior surgery begin 6 hour surgery total 6 week . Calf mechanical compression device also utilized inpatient stay remain time exception physical therapy session . Diagnostic study assess thromboembolic event ( i.e . DVT , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , stroke ) order patient develops clinical sign symptom justify use . Patients follow regular interval ( 6wk , 3mo , 6mo , 1 year ) time point patient ask report adverse event ( DVT , PT , Stroke , myocardial infarction , infection , hospitalization ) occur since last visit . In case patient unable accurately report medical history , care provider question record obtain care facility necessary . An attempt make contact patient lose follow-up via telephone U.S. Mail . Safety study monitor independent Data Safety Monitoring Board 6 month interval study discontinue discretion base number adverse event .</detailed_description>
