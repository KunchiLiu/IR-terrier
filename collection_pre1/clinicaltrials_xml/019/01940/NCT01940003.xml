	<brief_title>Effects Aquatic Physical Exercise Program Glycaemic Control Perinatal Outcomes Gestational Diabetes : Study Protocol Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) increase worldwide associate adverse perinatal outcomes high risk chronic disease mother child . Physical exercise feasible diabetic pregnant woman contribute good glycemic control decrease adverse perinatal outcome . However randomize control trial ( RCT ) assess effect aquatic physical exercise GDM control adverse maternal fetal outcome . A RCT conduct Institute Medicine Professor Fernando Figueira ( IMIP ) , Brazil . IMIP reference hospital Northeast Brazil mother child care perform 6,000 delivery per year . The recruitment patient focus GDM woman diagnose IMIP refer center treatment . Obstetrical staff identify pregnant woman recently diagnose GDM . These patient approach member study team ask permission forward explanation study goal . GDM woman consider eligible enrollment fulfill inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . Interested patient invite sign write informed consent . Sample size calculate aim reduce glucose level 20 % intervention group . A power 80 % level significance 5 % accept calculated sample size arm 30 patient . Assuming drop 20 % , 72 pregnant woman include study . 36 gestational diabetic develop aquatic physical exercise program thermal pool , three time per week two month , 36 gestational diabetic receive usual care IMIP . To ensure similar guideline GDM clinical treatment maintain two group , IMIP obstetrical staff undertake ongoing GDM management trial participant period study . Participants usually clinically evaluated minimum every two week depend GDM control , accord IMIP guideline GDM . A capillary glucose test perform clinical visit . It analyze mean capillary glucose profile intervention ( minimum five determination per woman ) . Insulin oral hypoglycemic require compare among two group . All pregnant woman wear pedometer ( Yamax Digi Walker SW-200 , Tokyo , Japan ) whole study . Pedometer reading provide measure physical activity compare group . All diabetic pregnant woman record clinical history undertake cardiologic evaluation . Randomization do accord computed-generated allocation ( www.randomized.com ) . Pregnant woman assign , 1:1 ratio , exercise intervention usual care . Blinding study randomization arm possible due nature intervention . Primary endpoint glucose level control ( glicemy test ) use insulin ( use insulin ) , secondary endpoint follow maternal fetal outcome : weight gain pregnancy , blood pressure , preeclampsia diagnosis , intra-uterus growth restriction , preterm birth , Cesarean section , macrosomia maternal neonatal intensive care admission . The information acquire medical record patient . Maternal fetal characteristic study sample present group , intervention control term mean SD . For group comparison glucose level perinatal variable , continuous nominal data analyze test unpaired data χ2 test , respectively . Data analyze use intention-to-treat principle . Statistical analysis perform STATA version 3.1 level significance set &lt; 0.05 . Even case appearance criterion discontinuation intervention ( Aquatic physical exercise ) , patient consider part group initially include randomization ( intent treat ) exclude study . In order evaluate criterion discontinuation study establish Committee External Monitoring ( CME ) . The physical propriety water provide aquatic exercise ideal pregnant woman . An aquatic physical exercise program develop GDM woman thermal pool physiotherapist supervision must ensure compliance . It expect study provide evidence real role aquatic physical exercise GDM control .</detailed_description>
