	<brief_title>A Study Assessing Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics SEP-363856 Male Female Subjects With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , randomize , single-blind , placebo-controlled , ascend single oral dose study design evaluate safety , tolerability , PK SEP-363856 metabolite SEP-363854 male female subject schizophrenia . This study determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) single oral dose SEP-363856 , characterize plasma PK profile SEP-363856 metabolite SEP-363854 male female subject schizophrenia . For dose-escalation cohort , 12 subject ( 9 active subject 3 placebo subject ) receive single oral dose . An attempt make least one-third subject cohort female . Each cohort comprise 12 subject ( 9 active , 3 placebo ) . Within cohort , subject randomize receive either SEP-363856 ( active ) match placebo 3:1 ratio . The plan dose level evaluate : - Cohort 1 : A single oral 25 mg dose SEP-363856 match placebo . - Cohort 2 : A single oral 50 mg dose SEP-363856 match placebo . - Cohort 3 : A single oral 100 mg dose SEP-363856 match placebo . - Cohort 4 : A single oral 150 mg dose SEP-363856 match placebo .</detailed_description>
