	<detailed_description>Background : Hand foot mouth disease ( HFMD ) common infectious disease cause variety enterovirus . A small proportion infect enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) develop neurological systemic complication may prove fatal . Over past 15 year EV71 relate HFMD cause increase epidemic HFMD across Asia ; 2011 , excess 100,000 Vietnamese child diagnose clinically HFMD 164 die . The neurological problem concern brainstem encephalitis , cause autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) dysregulation may progress rapidly cardiopulmonary failure . Management ANS dysregulation difficult even sophisticated western intensive care unit . The phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor , Milrinone , report control hypertension support myocardial function small informal study severe HFMD compare historical control , practice treatment remain largely empirical . ANS dysregulation also occur severe tetanus body evidence indicate intravenous magnesium sulphate ( Mg ) effective control tetanus-associated cardiovascular instability . Mg also use widely eclampsia , severe asthma pulmonary hypertension , report rapid control life-threatening autonomic hyperreflexia patient spinal lesion . Formal safety data child limit , adverse effect appear infrequent . In series 24 severe EV71 confirm HFMD case manage recently Hospital Tropical Diseases , Ho Chi Minh City , Mg add hypertension remain poorly control despite high-dose Milrinone . In case blood pressure ( BP ) reduce within 30-60 minute remain stable subsequently continuous Mg infusion 48-72 hour . Hypothesis Aims : We hypothesize early intervention Mg , ANS dysregulation first become apparent , control cardiovascular instability prevent progression severe disease . The main aim follow : - - To evaluate effect Mg hypertension ANS dysregulation severe HFMD - To evaluate effect Mg outcome ( death neurological sequela ) severe HFMD - To evaluate change plasma/urine catecholamine level , cardiac output systemic vascular resistance ( SRV ) severe HFMD , assess impact Mg parameter . Study Design : We plan randomize double blind trial compare intravenous Mg placebo child admit pediatric intensive care unit clinical HFMD , ANS dysregulation , Stage 1 hypertension . Patients eligible enrolment arterial blood pressure exceed 95th centile age , gender length/height least 30 minute child distress , exhibit least one criterion ANS dysregulation , parent/guardian give write informed consent . Specific renal cardio-respiratory exclusion criterion apply . A load dose 50mg/kg either Mg identical placebo give 20 minute follow maintenance infusion 72 hour accord response , aim Mg level 2-3 time normal treatment arm . All staff involve clinical care blind treatment allocation , Mg level monitor adjust independent doctor another clinical facility . The primary endpoint composite endpoint disease progression define occurrence follow within 72 hour : specific blood pressure criterion necessitate addition milrinone , need ventilation , development shock , death . Secondary endpoint include presence neurological sequela discharge survivor , various measure cardiac output systemic vascular resistance , catecholamine cytokine level . Based 1:1 randomization , anticipate relative reduction risk progression 50 % ( 50 % control arm 25 % Mg recipient , information case series plus indirect evidence study severe tetanus ) , 90 % power two-sided 5 % significance level , 85 patient per treatment group require . To allow violation assumption loss follow-up , plan recruit 190 patient ( 95 patient per treatment arm ) study . Potential Impact : Given large number HFMD case see hospital Asia currently , Mg show effective control ANS dysregulation prevent severe HFMD complication would major importance paediatric care throughout Asian region . Mg cheap , readily available safe whereas milrinone expensive , significant side effect profile often available outside major centre .</detailed_description>
