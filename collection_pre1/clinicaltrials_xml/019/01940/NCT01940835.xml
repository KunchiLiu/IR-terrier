	<brief_title>Role Intestinal Inflammation Pathogenesis Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There large body literature hint role gut Type One Diabetes ( T1D ) pathogenesis . However , best knowledge definitive evidence date conclusively demonstrate link . The way test hypothesis access intestinal tissue T1D patient early stage beta-islet cell destruction still ongoing . Furthermore , prepare large prospective study critical determine whether peripheral blood signature intestinal inflammation . Finally , enteroviral infection implicate T1D pathogenesis , study provide unique opportunity determine whether dysregulated response innate stimulus associate viral infection whether evidence transcriptional signature indicative viral infection gut correlated disease . Finally , take advantage pilot study collect sample use microbiome , virome metabolic study .</detailed_description>
