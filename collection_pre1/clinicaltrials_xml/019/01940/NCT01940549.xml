	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Enhancement Trauma-focused Therapy Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) debilitating , often-chronic psychiatric condition emerge follow severe traumatic event . Trauma-focused therapy technique , primarily Prolonged Exposure , constitute primary first-line treatment . While effective degree , method several substantial shortcoming , include limited patient compliance ( long process ) responsiveness , sustain therapeutic effect , susceptibility spontaneous symptom relapse . Thus , considerable need enhance efficacy PTSD treatment . Dominant theory field PTSD emphasize key role threat-related learn memory process underlie etiology maintenance PTSD symptom , absent insufficient extinction learn fear association . Indeed , trauma-focused therapy protocol typically involve repeat imaginal vivo recall traumatic memory systematic , controlled manner , employ anxiety-reducing technique , without experience additional external trauma . Thus , therapy parallel cue-extinction training within model learn unlearning conditioned response , patient 's diminished fear response successive extinction trial reflect weaken trauma-induced association fear-provoking stimulus condition fear response . Extinction fear responses thus generally assume one important underlie mechanisms exposure therapy . Noting limited efficacy trauma-focused treatment ( particular spontaneous relapse ) , much room improve effectiveness cue-extinction process manner dangerous patient ( cf . extinction-enhancing pharmacological agent also toxic ) . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) safe method induce weak transcranial current ( 1-2 milliampere ) . Using 2 rubber electrode position scalp , tDCS use manipulate localize brain excitability via membrane polarisation : cathodal stimulation hyperpolarises , anodal stimulation depolarises rest membrane potential , whereby induced after-effects depend polarity , duration intensity stimulation . The investigator believe therapeutic efficacy PTSD treatment enhance employ tDCS therapeutic process . That , tDCS 's modulatory effect exist brain activity may enable u render therapeutic mechanism operate trauma-focused therapy effective , leading efficient efficacious therapeutic process term great symptom reduction , great long-term sustainability , short treatment course , broad compliance .</detailed_description>
