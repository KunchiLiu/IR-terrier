	<detailed_description>The central hypothesis proposal decline androgen level result decrease action contributes molecular derangement associate priapism . Optimizing androgen status may promote regulatory molecular mechanism protect priapism . This clinical trial investigate potential benefit precise testosterone replacement ameliorate priapism improve psychological well-being hypogonadal men SCD . This clinical trial aim evaluate efficacy testosterone replacement therapy frequency recurrent priapism patient SCD . The sub-hypothesis testosterone ( T ) replacement achieve serum T concentration target range reduces recurrent priapism test . This aim involve subjective objective assessment priapism occurrence erectile ability include priapism inventory instrument , standardized questionnaire erectile function ( EF ) quality life , Rigiscanâ„¢ erection monitor 3.5-month pilot investigation .</detailed_description>
