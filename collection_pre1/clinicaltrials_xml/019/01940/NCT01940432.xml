	<brief_summary>This research primarily compare effectiveness electroacupuncture pelvic floor muscle training SUI , evaluate optimal efficiency electroacupuncture stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) . The early clinical research randomize control trial ( RCT ) small sample , consist two arm electroacupuncture group sham electroacupuncture group value difference extent SUI 1h pad test 4 week . The result indicate electroacupuncture optimal method SUI . As study , research large sample multicenter trial two parallel arm electroacupuncture group pelvic floor muscle train group . The primary purpose value effectiveness electroacupuncture SUI aspect frequency leakage amount leakage , compare pelvic floor muscle training . And secondary purpose evaluate safety electroacupuncture therapy , compare acceptance electroacupuncture treatment pelvic floor muscle training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Electroacupuncture Treatment Simple Female Stress Urinary Incontinence : Comparison With Pelvic Floor Muscle Training-a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence ( UI ) define complaint involuntary leakage . Researches show 9 % -72 % woman age 17-79 urinary incontinence , stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) prevalent type urinary incontinence . The morbidity rate UI world 27.6 % , SUI take percentage 50.Morbidity rate UI Beijing 46.5 % , among 59.6 % SUI . Aging high risk SUI , increase morbidity rate SUI . Totally , 61.9 % woman 50 year-old SUI . SUI define complaint involuntary leakage sneeze coughing , make patient embarrassed attend social activity normally , decrease quality life . Attending social activity important people 's health , otherwise , people get series disease , like osteoporosis , obesity , diabetes , hypertension , coronary heart disease , etc The International Consultation Urological Diseases recommend pelvic floor muscle train A level evidence treat simple mild moderate stress urinary incontinence , curative rate varies 30 % 60 % . But length treatment last least 3 month . Therefore , patient ' compliance key effectiveness . While , electroacupuncture verify well treatment SUI , length treatment shorter pelvic floor muscle training , effective rate 80 % , show potential advantage . Early clinical research show electroacupuncture SUI effective . This subject primary compare effectiveness electroacupuncture pelvic floor muscle training SUI , evaluate optimal efficiency electroacupuncture SUI . The early clinical research randomize control trial ( RCT ) small sample , consist two arm , electroacupuncture group sham electroacupuncture group value difference extent SUI 1h pad test 4 week . The result indicate electroacupuncture effective . As study , research large sample multicenter trial two parallel arm electroacupuncture group pelvic floor muscle train group . The primary purpose value effectiveness electroacupuncture SUI aspect frequency leakage amount leakage , compare pelvic floor muscle training . And secondary purpose evaluate safety electroacupuncture therapy , compare acceptance electroacupuncture treatment pelvic floor muscle training .</detailed_description>
