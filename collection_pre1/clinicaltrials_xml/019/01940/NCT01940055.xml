	<detailed_description>Study design : A phase II , Pilot-Randomized clinical trial . Sample size 15 volunteer old adult group , age 70-80 year old living community attend Reh-Fit center exercise . Method : Recruitment : Individuals attend Reh-Fit center exercise physical activity . This coordinated organized staff Reh-Fit center inform member research study . Interventions : Each participant receive 45 minute program combine exercise cognitive activity twice week 10 week . One group receive dual-task treadmill walk program ( DT-TW ) 2nd group receive dual-task recumbent cycle program ( DT-RC ) . Both program contain cognitive activity deliver interactive `` cognitive '' video game . Dual-task treadmill walk program ( DT-TW ) : - 5 minute warm cool speed equivalent comfortable walk speed . - 30 minute dual-task treadmill walk 2-3 speed level . Speed select NOT exceed 60 % Max-HR , Heart rate ( HR ) , blood . Heart rate , blood pressure Perceived exertion ( Per Borg 1-10 scale ) measure 5 minute interval . Dual-task recumbent cycling program ( DT-RC ) - 5 minute warm cool per-determined speed resistance heart rate wold exceed 40 percent age maximum ( 220 minus age ) - 30 minute dual-task ( treadmill walk group recumbent cycle group ) training , perform concurrent cognitive game minute rest period require . The intensity cycling select achieve 50- 60 % Max-HR . Heart rate , blood pressure Perceived exertion ( Per Borg 1-10 scale ) measure 5 minute interval For participant five eight computer game select play walk cycle collection 60 purchase form Big Fish Games ( www.bigfishgames.com ) . A commercial motion mouse ( Gyration Air Mouse , USA ) secure head band use computer input device control on-screen cursor motion head rotation ( left-right ) . This motion Mouse inertial sensor use derive angular position signal . With simple method , seamless responsive hands-free interaction computer application make possible . The computer game involve goal- direct cognitive activity include mix ( ) precision movement interact game target , ( b ) presence distractors , ( c ) search match task , ( ) work memory . Data Analysis Outcome Measures : Demographic clinical data : Age , sex , fall history , Mini Mental score Examination ( MMSE ) great 24 . The Community Health Activities Model Program Seniors questionnaire ( CHAMPS ) . Primary outcome : Cardiac fitness measure Young Men 's Christian Association ( YMCA ) Cycle Ergometer Sub-maximal test ( ACSM 's Guidelines Exercise Testing . During test , heart rate ( HR ) , blood pressure ( BP ) , revolution per minute ( RPM ) rate perceive exertion ( RPE ) record 5 minute interval ( Borg , 1982 ) . Validated performance-based measure balance ; ( ) Clinical Test Sensory Integration Balance , ( ii ) Five-Time Sit-to-Stand Test . Walking endurance measure use 6-minute walk test . Spatial Temporal Gait Variables measure treadmill walk fix speed 0.9 meter per second . A treadmill instrument Force Sensory Array ( FSA ) pressure mat ( Vista Medical , Ca ) use purpose . Each participant walk two minute follow variable ( average coefficient variation 60 consecutive step ) ; determine : stance duration , swing time , step time , step length step width . Dual task walk performance : A custom computer application work Gyration motion mouse develop purpose . The cognitive game task similar Useful Field View test ( UFOV ) . The goal test game move paddle ( game sprite ) catch fall bright circle object ( target ) move vertically top bottom , avoid shape ( color ) game object ( dis-tractors ) . The object appear user define fix interval ( e.g . 2 second ) random location monitor . The game instrument assessment module . This generate logged game file record ( 80 Hz ) follow signal associate player performance respect game event : ( ) time index coordinate game object ( ii ) position coordinate game paddle ( slave head rotation ) . Features test game event provide basis objective quantification cognitive function , include . ( ) game success rate ( percentage target caught ) , ( ii ) average motor response time ( time appearance target start paddle movement ) , ( iii ) average movement execution time ( iv ) movement efficiency . The cognitive game task first perform standing ( single task ) treadmill wake 0.9 m/s ( dual-task walk condition ) . The difference spatial -temporal gait variable walk alone ( describe ) dual task walk condition use index dual-task performance . Gaze Stability Test : A custom computer application develop purpose . This consist track bright visual target move horizontally left right computer display fix amplitude ( 80 % monitor width ) frequency 0.4 Hz . A 70 monitor use , position eye-level , 100 cm away participant . This result head horizontal rotation 30 40 degree , leave right center . The test procedure involve close loop track task ( respect head ) . In task two cursor different color appear monitor . One target cursor 2nd cursor slave head rotation via head mount motion mouse . The task goal overlap two cursor cyclic left-to-right cursor motion . In task foveation necessary determine amount overlap ( error ) target cursor head cursor . Nero-psychological test : We use Standardized Nero-psychological test target executive function : This include test battery three executive function ( Trial Making Test A-B , verbal fluency , visual Search. ) . Also , The National Institutes Health ( NIH ) toolbox cognitive test , target executive function include dimensional change card sort . 1 . Trial Making test ( A &amp; B ) : It valid reliable well-established test , valid measure target speed processing , response inhibition task-switching . This test grade time . It use widely clinical evaluation assessment deficit cognitive function . It administer two part : 1 ) Trial Making test form A , subject require draw line sequentially connect numbered circle arrange randomly page quickly possible ; 2 ) Trial Making test form B demanding task require subject connect circle contain number letter alternate sequence . 2 . Verbal fluency : It test work memory language participant say many word possible category give time ( usually 60 second ) . The test include semantic phonemic section , show highly reliable valid among elderly population . 3 . Visual search test : It test speed processing , cognition inhibition attention participant look target stimulus among dis-tractor stimulus ( usually 60 second ) . The test measure reaction time number select item . It show reliable valid measure among elderly . 4 . Dimensional change card sort : It test work memory cognitive inhibition participant ask match set two test picture differ color target picture ( usually 10 second ) . The test measure reaction time number select item . Participants assess blind assessor prior begin intervention within one week complete 10 week program . Pre post intervention assessment spread two day , last approximately 60 minute ample rest period . Performing balance treadmill walk assessment perform concurrent cognitive task may difficult participant may lose balance .
