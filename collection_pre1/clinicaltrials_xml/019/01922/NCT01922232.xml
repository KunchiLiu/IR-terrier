	<detailed_description>Purpose : Primary Endpoint : 1 . To assess feasibility use pre-treatment ADC predictor complete pathologic response neo-adjuvant chemotherapy radical cystectomy Secondary Endpoint : 1 . To explore association pre-treatment ADC value complete pathologic response neoadjuvant chemotherapy radical cystectomy . Background Rationale 1 . Management Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Bladder cancer common malignancy estimate 15,210 death 2013 United States.1 Although majority patient present non-invasive disease , approximately 20 % 40 % patient either present advanced disease , progress treatment superficial disease . Muscle-invasive bladder cancer characterize distinct biology include loss tumor suppressor gene TP53 , Rb , PTEN result 50 % case progress lethal phenotype metastatic disease . This necessitate aggressive approach management compare non-invasive disease typically manage resection tumor without intravesical therapy Bacillus Calmette-Guérin . The standard treatment muscle-invasive bladder cancer radical cystectomy bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy This morbid surgery include removal prostate gland , seminal vesicle proximal urethra men removal urethra , uterus , fallopian tube , anterior vaginal wall surround fascia woman creation urinary diversion . There also level one evidence preoperative systemic chemotherapy ( neoadjuvant ) patient T2-T4a , node negative disease . A US phase 3 intergroup trial randomize patient invasive bladder cancer neoadjuvant M-VAC ( methotrexate , vinblastine , adriamycin cisplatin ) plus cystectomy cystectomy alone demonstrate 85 % 5-year survival patient experience complete pathologic response.2 In total , 2 prospective randomize trial well 2 large meta-analyses demonstrate survival benefit use cisplatin-based combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior chemotherapy.2-5 These data establish cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy standard care patient MIBC consider radical cystectomy . Current standard regimen use neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy include gemcitabine cisplatin ( GC ) , M-VAC cisplatin , methotrexate vinblastine ( CMV ) . However , patient respond neoadjuvant chemotherapy . In US Intergroup study , complete pathologic response rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy 38 % significantly great rate observe cystectomy alone arm ( 15 % ; p &lt; 0.001 ) .2 For patient residual invasive disease time cystectomy , median survival patient residual invasive disease time cystectomy 3.8 year establish complete pathologic response chemotherapy reliable surrogate long-term survival . To date , effective mean differentiate muscle-invasive bladder cancer patient less likely benefit neoadjuvant chemotherapy , thus potentially leading relative underutilization.6 Clearly , ability reliably predict patient respond neoadjuvant chemotherapy would tremendous clinical value . This ability would facilitate selective application neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient likely respond , allow patient unlikely respond proceed directly surgery . While various host tumor marker explore purpose , none validate prospectively thus part routine clinical use.7,8 2 . Standard Imaging Bladder Cancer Current image modality use stag bladder cancer include contrast-enhanced multi-detector compute tomography ( MDCT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) abdomen pelvis . MRI also limit ability detect pelvic lymph node metastasis report sensitivity 50 % .9,10 While consider standard care , MRI may perform good CT determination local disease extent report accuracy detection deep muscle invasion extravesical tumor invasion 94 % 97 % , respectively . Further , functional MRI-based metric may provide simple non-invasive method evaluate bladder tumor predict sensitivity neoadjuvant chemotherapy . In particular , diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) functional technique reflect tissue cellularity molecular motion water molecule . Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value obtain DWI show prior study predict tumor aggressiveness . In solid tumor , ADC value show predict response neoadjuvant chemotherapy chemoradiotherapy.11,12 In addition , one small retrospective study suggest role ADC value predict response chemoradiation muscle-invasive bladder cancer.13 If substantiate prospective study , utility potential greatly impact clinical management bladder cancer . Methods This prospective study enroll 40 patient clinical stage T2-T4aN0M0 urothelial cancer bladder candidate cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow radical cystectomy . All patient undergo pre- post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy DW-MRI abdomen pelvis ADC value primary tumor measure . The choice standard option neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy determine accord treat physician ' discretion . The primary endpoint study explore association ADC value pre-treatment DW-MRI abdomen pelvis complete pathologic response rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy assess radical cystectomy pelvic lymph node dissection . Patients undergo gadolinium-enhanced MRI chemotherapy part standard treatment bladder cancer , regardless participation research . Both study evaluate part research . No additional imaging contrast administration perform participation research . MRI Patients undergo standard clinical MRI within 4 week prior start neoadjuvant chemotherapy complete chemotherapy . The MRI do use Siemens scanner pelvic phased-array coil . A state-of-the-art protocol perform , include multi-planar high-resolution turbo spin-echo T2-weighted imaging . In addition , examination include diffusion-weighted imaging pelvis perform use b-values 0 , 400 , 800 s/mm2 . DWI perform use echo-planar imaging sequence tri-directional motion-probing gradient , in-line reconstruction ADC map . Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Patients receive standard neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy recommend clinical practice guideline ( http : //ww.nccn.org ) support level 1 evidence.2,4,14,15 Radical Cystectomy Patients eligible surgery completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy undergo radical cystectomy pelvic lymph node dissection include prostatectomy men anterior exenteration ( hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ) woman . The standard bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy consist removal nodal tissue obturator , internal external iliac nodal packet . The standard border lymph node dissection bladder medially , node Cloquet distally , pelvic sidewall genitofemoral nerve laterally , proximally common iliac vessel . If MRI follow chemotherapy demonstrate evidence intra-abdominal metastasis amenable resection , standard care become radical cystectomy pelvic lymph node dissection , surgical resection intra-abdominal metastasis . Pathologic Tumor Response Criteria : Complete pathologic response define complete eradication urothelial cancer radical cystectomy pelvic lymph node dissection specimen ( pT0N0 ) . Residual cancer stag accord AJCC 2007 TNM stag system bladder cancer . Inclusion Criteria - Histologically confirm muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma bladder - Clinical stage T2-T4a N0/X M0 disease - Age ≥ 18 year age - Medically appropriate candidate radical cystectomy , per NYU Attending Urologic Oncologist - Medically appropriate candidate cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy per NYU Attending Medical Oncologist - If female childbearing potential , pregnancy test negative Exclusion Criteria - Prior systemic chemotherapy ( prior intravesical therapy allow ) - Prior radiation therapy bladder - Medical contraindication cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy determine NYU Attending Medical Oncologist - Concomitant use investigational drug - Inability tolerate MRI include condition claustrophobia inability lay flat &gt; 45 minute . - Presence pacemaker/ICD perfusion pump - Ferromagnetic implant aneurysm clip , surgical clip , prosthesis , artificial heart , valve steel part , metal fragment , shrapnel , bullet , tattoo near eye , steel implant . - Substance abuse , medical , psychological , social condition may interfere patient 's participation study Statistical Analysis The primary objective study assess feasibility use pre-treatment ADC value predictor complete pathologic response ( CPR ) neo-adjuvant chemotherapy radical cystectomy . Specifically , objective test whether pre-treatment ADC demonstrate sufficient accuracy predictor CPR warrant large scale clinical trial formally assess prognostic utility pre-treatment ADC . Formally , consider pre-treatment ADC warrant study reasonable conclude correctly predict presence versus absence CPR least 80 % patient undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy declare investigation unwarranted data suggest accurately predict response few 60 % patient . Therefore , study design test null hypothesis H0 : P &lt; 60 % alternative hypothesis HA : P ≥ 80 % , P true percentage time pre-treatment ADC correctly predict whether patient manifest CPR . A jackknife procedure use derive valid assessment prediction accuracy . It anticipate 36 patient reference standard evaluation treatment response . If pre-treatment ADC observe correctly predict treatment response least 27 36 patient ( i.e . TC ≥ 27 ) , null hypothesis reject conclude study warrant . It note The sample size determine study 80 % power 5 % significance level test null hypothesis H0 : P &lt; 60 % alternative hypothesis HA : P ≥ 80 % . A statistical power assessment indicate study would need data least 36 patient reference standard evaluation treatment response . Since prior experience indicate 90 % patient evaluable treatment response , study accrue 40 patient order achieve target sample size . We also perform unpaired t-tests assess difference ADC value patient achieve pT0N0 versus . An exact 95 % confidence interval derive true percentage time pre-treatment ADC expect correctly predict whether patient manifest CPR .</detailed_description>
