	<brief_summary>Obesity common , cause many medical problem adult ( e.g. , diabetes , hypertension , high cholesterol , sleep apnea , heart attack , stroke ) . A range treatment show effective treating obesity . Treatments include lifestyle modification , meal replacement , weight loss medication . Most primary care setting provide much obesity treatment , though , primary care provider ( PCPs ) well trained reimbursement treatment consistent . Hypothesis : If PCPs train weight management cost treatment reimburse , surmise `` toolbox '' treatment produce clinically important weight loss amount large group patient . Design : We propose establish registry obese patient least one common medical condition relate weight . From registry , randomly select 350 people offer treatment assist weight loss . The remainder registry 's patient still receive obesity treatment reimburse . We conduct study Denver Health , large public health care system treat low income , ethnically diverse population . All 350 patient offer self-monitoring tool weight management chance computer assessment select right treatment weight loss . Patients complete record food intake physical activity 1 week offer `` Level 2 '' treatment weight loss . Level 2 treatment include : voucher commercial weight loss program ; intensive group weight loss counseling ; meal replacement ; gym membership ; weight loss medication . Patients choose treatment want , approval PCP . Researchers Denver Health help computer assessment dispense treatment . We interested percentage patient lose least 5 % start weight . We also explore change glucose , blood pressure , cholesterol , look much intervention cost whether patient need less medication weight-related condition end study . Impact : If study successful , plan take result leader Denver Health see make obesity treatment broadly available patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Toolbox Approach Obesity Treatment Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Obesity prevalent root cause many common medical condition affect U.S. adult . A range treatment option demonstrate efficacy produce weight loss reduce health risk randomize controlled trial . However , little obesity treatment currently deliver primary care setting . Inadequate reimbursement treatment modality lack systematic training primary care provider ( PCPs ) two major barrier widespread treatment . Hypothesis : If PCPs give train support weight management , treatment option prove efficacy offer obese adult weight related co-morbidities majority treatment cost reimburse , clinically meaningful weight loss produce significant number individual reasonable cost . Design : This application propose 12 month intervention trial among obese adult care 4 primary care clinic affiliate Denver Health ( DH ) , integrate health care system serve ethnically diverse medically underserved population . From among large population patient ( ~8,000 ) obesity least one co-morbid condition , 350 individual randomly select offer `` toolbox '' treatment option . The remainder assign control condition . The `` toolbox '' include : 1 ) meal replacement ; 2 ) group weight loss counseling ; 3 ) membership recreation center ; 4 ) pharmacotherapy phentermine ; 5 ) option . Patients intervention arm undergo initial evaluation use `` expert system '' computer program . They require self-monitor diet physical activity gain access high cost weight management service toolbox . Primary care provider help patient choose treatment approach , encourage adherence , monitor success . Patient Navigators assist patient access prescribed treatment . The primary outcome fraction patient group achieve 5 % weight loss 12 month intervention . Secondary outcome include uptake utilization treatment option , change cardiovascular disease risk factor , health care utilization , particular outpatient medication diabetes , hypertension , lipid . While treatment modality use trial new , intervention deliver toolbox weight management service safety net clinical setting examine effect health care utilization innovative . The submitted letter support attest need data health care provider payer make evidence-based decision regard provision obesity treatment large patient population . Impact : A positive result would encourage broad adoption toolbox approach weight management primary care setting . A negative result would strongly suggest even `` best case scenario '' train support obesity treatment , primary care clinic effective route delivery weight management . Either result would important shaping future policy decision obesity treatment .</detailed_description>
