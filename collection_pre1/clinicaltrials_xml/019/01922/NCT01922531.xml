	<brief_title>Defining Axonal Injury Children With Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine child mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) acute axonal injury define disruption diffusion water white matter use diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) compare orthopedic injury ( OI ) control . Methods : Children age 11-16 year present within 6 hour either mTBI isolate OI recruit emergency department ( ED ) . Patients Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) study perform within 96 hour injury . Voxel base analysis approach use quantify group difference common DTI measure . In ED time scan , symptom burden measure use post concussion symptom scale .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>mTBI group : Inclusion : Children age &gt; 11 &lt; 16 year present within 6 hour injury witness head injury . A patient may selfreported injury head must also evidence head trauma exam eligible study . Subjects must meet clinical definition mTBI American Congress Rehabilitation Medicine122 : A blow head acceleration/deceleration movement head result one following : i. loss consciousness &lt; 30 minute , ii . amnesia &lt; 24 hour , iii . alteration mental state time injury . Subjects without witnessed LOC/amnesia demonstrable amnesia ED eligible . Subject must GCS 1315 time arrival ED . Subject may enrol prior CT ( complete ) . Subjects 1 minor extracranial injury define Abbreviated Injury Severity Scale &lt; 1 region ( AIS ; American Association Automotive Medicine , 1990 ) . Subjects include multiple injury affect 1 body system note AIS ( ie , subject sustain skin abrasion 1 body region result injury meet exclusion base injury severity ) Subjects family must able speak read English . Subjects must agree blood drawn ED , return three time outpatient repeat test . Subjects still eligible admitted hospital . Subjects must score less 65 CBCL include study limit possible comorbidities . Children diagnosis Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) include long meet follow criterion : physician diagnose , control one ADHD medication , Tscore le 50 DSM Oriented Scale Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( SubCategory CBCL ) . Orthopedic Injury Control Group : Subjects isolated extremity trauma require radiography Abbreviated Injury Scale ( AIS ) &lt; 3 ( AIS ; American Association Automotive Medicine , 1990 ) 123 include study . The presence fracture xray requirement inclusion . Subjects require immediate surgery care . We attempt match base gender age ( +/ 365 day within included age range 1116 ) ; yet , enroll consecutive eligible patient meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.Subjects must evidence head trauma / facial trauma symptom concussion ( LOC , amnesia , confusion ) . This information must corroborate reliable witness parent treat physician . Subjects must normal neurologic exam must require head CT part clinical care . Subjects may prescribe narcotic and/or opiate prescribe pain ED allow IF subject agree refrain take medication least 4 hour prior complete neurobehavioral test followup . Subjects must meet CBCL score ADHD definition list mTBI group . mTBI Group : Children &lt; 11 &gt; 16 year old subject and/or family speak read English exclude . Subjects score 65 CBCL exclude due probable preexist impairment . Any subject alter mental status due ingestion substance abuse alcohol prescribe drug impairs cognition ( e.g. , benzodiazepine , antipsychotic , opiate list ( limited ) Appendix L ) . Subjects exclude prior history concussion , preexist neurologic impairment ( stroke , prior TBI require ED visit hospitalization , CSF shunt , brain tumor ) , preexist cognitive disorder ( seizure disorder , mental retardation ) , psychological problem developmental delay . Subjects follow illness also exclude : bleeding coagulation disorder , cancer ( currently undergo treatment ) , HIV/AIDS , schizophrenia , multiple sclerosis , cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy subcortical infarct leukoencephalopathy ( CADASIL ) , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , Alzheimer 's Disease , CreutzfeldtJakob Disease , Krabbe Disease . Subjects exclude diagnosis ADHD require 2 medication control Tscore 50 great DSM Oriented Scale Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder . Subjects exclude medication typically prescribed ADHD carry diagnosis ADHD . Subjects exclude condition preclude undergoing magnetic resonance imaging detailed Appendix L. These include implanted medical device ( i.e. , cardiac pace maker , hear aid , implant ) ; metal body meet criterion MRI machine ( i.e . brace , plate , screw ; since type metal responsive magnet permit , eligibility MRI investigate case ensure safety ) ; nonremovable jewelry body pierce ; pregnancy ; know claustrophobia ; extreme obesity ( due physical limitation magnet ) . Subjects one extracranial ( organ group ) injury AIS score &gt; 2 2 extracranial ( i.e . 2 organ group ) injury exclude , multiple injury one organ group ( ie , skin abrasion 1 extremity ) still eligible . Orthopedic Injury Control Group : Subjects present orthopedic injury , well head trauma sign symptom mTBI exclude . Subjects reliable witness determine loss consciousness , amnesia , confusion related injury exclude . Subjects enrol subsequently receive Head CT enrollment discontinue . Subjects prescribe drug impairs cognition ( e.g. , benzodiazepine , antipsychotic , opiate ) exclude . Any inability unwillingness complete study procedure include follow procedure exclude . Subjects eligible serve control use computer mouse due injury . Patients must exclusion criterion list mTBI group ( ie , CBCL score , ADHD diagnosis , preexist condition , MRI Contraindications )</criteria>
