	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Daptomycin Compared Active Comparator Pediatric Participants With Acute Hematogenous Osteomyelitis ( AHO ) ( MK-3009-006 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis common problem pediatric population , affect approximately 5/10,000 child year accounting approximately 1 % pediatric hospitalization . In child , osteomyelitis arises bacteremic seed bone metaphysis . Daptomycin , cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial active clinically significant gram-positive pathogen include drug-resistant strain Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus ( S. ) aureus ( MRSA ) Methicillin Susceptible S. aureus ( MSSA ) . Daptomycin proven clinical efficacy adult treatment complicate skin skin structure infection ( cSSSI ) cause aerobic gram-positive pathogen treatment S. aureus bloodstream infection ( bacteremia ; SAB ) , include complicate right-sided infective endocarditis , cause MSSA MRSA . Although indicated osteomyelitis , daptomycin successfully use treat osteoarticular infection adult child salvage therapy medical center increasingly high rate vancomycin resistant organism . In addition , comparative clinical trial need pediatric AHO good elucidate optimal treatment regimen clinical response .</detailed_description>
