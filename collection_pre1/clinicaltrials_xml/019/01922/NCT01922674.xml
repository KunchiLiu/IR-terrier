	<detailed_description>Screening potential patient trial conduct patient present surgeon 's office possible hernia . Unless unequivocal contraindication present , patient schedule see participate surgeon confirm candidate study . Informed consent participation trial randomization obtain . Consent patient-centered data collection document translate Spanish French . After patient provide informed consent inclusion criterion satisfy , Study Coordinator telephone center staff confirm eligibility . The patient randomly assign either operation watchful wait randomization stratify : participate site , whether hernia primary recurrent , bilateral unilateral hernia . At time screening , anonymous list maintain patient enrol ; reason ineligibility non enrollment record addition patient age categories co-morbidities , name personal identification item record . These data use determine recruitment percentage whether important difference exist enrol non enrolled patient . The procedure describe Lichtenstein control operation . A videotape Amid , present 1998 Clinical Congress American College Surgeons , use standard Lichtenstein operation . The PIs institution review video investigator ' meeting patient recruitment begin detail procedure agree upon ; surgeon participate trial willing follow procedure describe . Local anesthesia recommend require . Several important technical feature operation adhere strictly . The prosthesis minimum 15 cm width 7.5 cm high overlap pubic tubercle onto anterior rectus sheath . A running , non absorbable monofilament suture use secure inferior border prosthesis begin anterior rectus sheath least 2 cm medial pubic tubercle . The suture continue laterally either side pubic tubercle along shelve edge inguinal ligament internal ring . Interrupted suture use necessary incorporate Cooper 's ligament repair extensive destruction inguinal floor femoral hernia . A slit lateral end mesh cut produce narrow ( 1/3-width ) tail wider ( 2/3-width ) tail . The spermatic cord position two tail . The inferior surface wider tail suture inferior surface narrow one shelving edge inguinal ligament , thereby create shutter valve act snug-fitting internal ring . This step consider particularly important prevent indirect recurrence . Simple linear reapproximation permit . The tail could trim minimum 6 cm lateral internal ring require . Written postoperative instruction provide patient . Watchful wait patient taught dangerous hernia symptom write instruction explanation provide . Subjects tell contact physician problem develop . They see person 6 month , yearly enrollment . Follow-up : Watchful wait patient give write instruction watch hernia symptom contact physician problem develop . Patients examine 6 month yearly enrollment .</detailed_description>
