	<brief_summary>Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) virus cause chest infection . It single important cause severe respiratory illness infant young child , severe RSV infection early life associate increase risk later develop asthma . RSV also cause severe disease elderly immune-compromised adult , amount RSV disease elderly similar seasonal flu . The virus transmit secretion upper respiratory tract infected individual contact contaminate surface ( toy ) . Hospital outbreaks , especially paediatric neonatal ward , uncommon . Infection RSV develop natural long-lasting protection re-infection ( like , example , measles ) . In USA nearly child 24 month age infect least RSV , half experience two infection . There effective anti-viral drug treat infection way manage case severe infection support organ , lung , withstand recover illness . There remain real need develop effective vaccine prevent severe infection cause RSV . A well understanding way immune system respond RSV child would aid development vaccine . The purpose study increase understand immune system respond RSV . Only limited data available important component immune response study design measure detail . This do use single blood sample . A total 35 child anticipate recruit study , age expect see difference immune response RSV ; - 5 infant age 2 4 month ( Group 1 ) , yet expose RSV - 20 infant age 6 12 month ( Group 2 ) , exposure one single RSV season winter 2011/12 - 10 child age 3 6 year ( Group 3 ) , expose RSV several winter season</brief_summary>
