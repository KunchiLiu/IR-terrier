Anaemia ( low blood Haemoglobin level ) common problem occur HF , range 14 % 56 % outpatient registry clinical trial .

ID without overt anaemia may present HF patient . A recent study Jankowska et al publish 2010 546 HF patient show 37 % prevalence ID , regardless Haemoglobin level . This associated bad outcome include impaired exercise capacity . The presence ID indicate high likelihood deteriorate die early . A landmark study publish New England Journal Medicine ( The Ferinject Assessment Patients Iron Deficiency Chronic Heart Failure ( FAIR-HF ) study ) show HF patient treat IV iron form Ferric Carboxymaltose ( FCM ) well outcome , include improve exercise capacity , overall function , quality life .

Hypothesis We hypothesise treat ID HF patient Asia use FCM improve outcome include exercise capacity , quality life , overall functional status , need hospitalise complication arise HF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) major global public health issue also affect Asia . Singapore National Registry Disease data show 9.4 % rise public hospital HF admission 2008 2009 ( 4140 4530 ) . Anaemia ( low blood Haemoglobin level ) common co-morbidity HF , range 14 % 56 % outpatient registry clinical trial . Anaemia exacerbate basic symptom HF dyspnea exercise intolerance , thereby reduce quality life ( QoL ) . However , recent approach aim improve normalize Haemoglobin unsuccessful ( STAMINA-HeFT , RED-HF ) .Novel approach require address problem . Iron deficiency ( ID ) well-understood cause anaemia . ID without overt anaemia may present HF patient . The study Jankowska ( 2010 ) 546 systolic HF patient 37 % prevalence ID , regardless Haemoglobin level . This associate reduce peak oxygen consumption , high ventilatory response , impaired exercise capacity , depressive symptom HF patient . ID strong independent predictor death , heart transplantation , poor clinical outcome chronic HF.The Ferinject Assessment Patients Iron Deficiency Chronic Heart Failure ( FAIR-HF ) study show significant improvement 6MWT , NYHA class , overall QoL score HF patient treat IV iron form Ferric Carboxymaltose ( FCM ) .Unpublished preliminary data ongoing Nation-wide Singapore study Heart Failure ( SHOP ) indicate observed point prevalence ID approximately 60 % significant direct correlation exercise performance.To date , study exist FCM Asian HF population . We hypothesise IV Iron repletion therapy use FCM Asian patient HF ID improve outcome include exercise capacity ( measure 6MWT ) , quality life ( measured Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( KCCQ amp ; VAS ) , NYHA functional class , rate HF hospitalization . Primary Aim To determine effect IV iron repletion therapy compare placebo exercise capacity change assess 6MWT 4th 12th week administration IV FCM subject recent acutely decompensated heart failure iron deficiency . Secondary Aims To assess effect IV FCM compare placebo change QoL assessment ( KCCQ amp ; VAS ) .To assess effect IV FCM compare placebo change NYHA Functional Class.To ass effect IV FCM compare placebo rate HF Hospitalization.To ass safety tolerability IV FCM compare placebo . Hypothesis We hypothesise IV Iron repletion therapy use FCM patient HF ID improve outcome include exercise capacity ( measure 6MWT ) , quality life ( measure KCCQ amp ; VAS ) , NYHA functional class , rate HF hospitalization .</detailed_description>
