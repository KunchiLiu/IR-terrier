	<brief_summary>The purpose trial test whether , compare normal Standard Care primary health care clinic , home-based counseling intervention ( 'Amagugu ' Counseling Intervention ) , increase number HIV-infected mother able disclose HIV status primary school-aged child . The investigator also wish examine whether intervention improve quality maternal-child relationship , emotional well-being child social support .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maternal HIV Disclosure School Children : RCT Family-based Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research aim The primary aim clinical trial test efficacy intervention aim increase rate maternal HIV disclosure HIV-uninfected child age 6-9 year . Secondary aim include improve : 1. health promotion custody plan mother child ; 2. maternal child mental health ; 3. family function quality mother-child relationship ; Hypothesis We hypothesize intensive home-based intervention ( 'Amagugu ' Counseling Intervention ) , compare Standard Care clinic facility , significantly increase rate maternal HIV disclosure result improvement quality maternal-child relationship , emotional well-being child family support . Research design The intervention package successfully pilot late 2010 ( Rochat et al 2013 , BMC Public Health ) large scale feasibility acceptability field test complete 281 family April 2012 fund Canadian International Development Agency . Preliminary result show intervention highly acceptable , 90 % mother agree participate ; effective 90 % disclose child either 'fully ' ( use word 'HIV ' explain HIV ) 'partially ' ( use word 'virus ' explain virus ) . Sample size calculation Based pilot work show least 60 % mother disclose HIV status fully intervention . However , result also show prior disclosure current partner baseline significantly increase odds full disclosure child follow intervention . Since woman enrol trial already HIV care likely receive counsel support disclose HIV status partner . To allow possibility effect intervention control arm , power study conservatively ensure adequate power detect difference group . We assume 30 % woman control arm disclose HIV status child trial intervention increase proportion disclose HIV status child least 15 percentage point . Allowing loss-to-follow-up 20 % , 300 mother intervention arm 300 control arm provide &gt; 90 % power detect difference 30 % versus 45 % ( alpha type-one error 5 % , two-tailed ) HIV disclosure child . This design also provide adequate power main secondary outcome child 's social emotional wellbeing measure Child Behavior Checklist ( Achenbach &amp; Ruffle , 2000 ) describe objective . In high risk population child , one would expect mean CBCL total score 50 boy girl , standard deviation 10 . We hypothesize intervention would decrease CBCL total difficulty score least 3 point whilst would change CBCL score control group . With 300 woman group would &gt; 90 % power detect difference 3 point control intervention . Research methodology The research site The propose research manage Wellcome Trust-funded Africa Centre . Recruitment take place primary health care clinic locate 1 km Africa Centre headquarters . Participants enrol establish HIV Programme , include ( ) pre-ART patient attend clinic 6-monthly basis ass eligibility ART base immunological ( CD4 cell count ) clinical staging ( ii ) patient already ART . Recruitment monitor carefully number sufficient seek ethic permission expand additional clinic . Assessment schedule All 600 mother ( i.e . 300 intervention 300 Standard Care arm ) receive assessment four time point : enrollment CRA home one study interviewer follow : Time point 1 : Baseline assessment enrollment clinic ( CRA ) Time point 2 : 3-month assessment home ( study interviewer ) Time point 3 : 6-month assessment home ( study interviewer ) Time point 4 : 9-month assessment home ( study interviewer ) All assessment conduct isiZulu study interviewer blind whether mother randomize intervention Standard Care . Data collection Data collection complete use mobile phone digitally capture transmit data field site ( clinic woman 's home ) Africa Centre . Using key pad research staff load mobile researcher application phone display questionnaires assessment complete . On completion question assessment , answer store securely handsets phone range mobile phone signal tower . There signal tower situate adjacent Africa Centre , signal strength area propose research clinic generally excellent . When range , phone automatically securely upload data central database . Whilst main data capture method mobile phone , paper form use ( ) inform consent , ( ii ) participant track information . These form transport weekly clinic Africa Centre store secure Data Centre . The Africa Centre Standard Operating Procedures place track form field , clinic Centre , clear documentation identify 'chains custody ' form hand staff . In addition , book contain list participate mother unique study ID keep locked cabinet clinic ; accessible study staff . All file data clinic treat strict confident . The two paper form book place individual 's personal detail link unique study ID . Data management Following uploading , data check completeness accuracy follow day study coordinator ; query return field staff within 48 hour correction . Data cleaning occur fortnightly , routine check inaccuracy , outlying value miss data , immediate feed-back field team rectification . Data analysis An intention-to-treat analysis , base randomization , use primary trial outcome - proportion HIV-infected woman disclose HIV-uninfected child 3 , 6 9-months . Because possibility randomization may lead imbalance distribution risk factor across trial arm , assessment baseline characteristic know associated disclosure undertaken use binary logistic regression . These include age gender child , mother 's age , marital status family composition , mother 's health status , educational attainment collect part study . We report adjust unadjusted effect intervention disclosure . The outcome relate take child health promotion visit clinic develop clear custody care plan analyze use methodology . The Child Behavior Check List ( CBCL ) scale multi-axial , empirically-based measure assess child 's mental health behavior parent report . It consist 120 item , measure eight construct syndromes ( Withdrawn , Somatic complaint , Anxious/Depressed , Social Problems , Thought Problems , Attention Problems , Delinquent behavior , Aggressive behavior ) allow examination two broad group syndrome : Internalizing Externalizing problem . Raw score convert T score facilitate comparison across sub-scales , compute Total Internalizing , Externalizing Competence Score well Total score . T score 50 70 base percentile normative sample non- refer child . For statistical analysis syndrome scale research , raw scale score use T score , order take account full range variation scale . Scores standardize take age gender account . The CBCL cross-culturally validate , translate use research community use measure preliminary work applicant . In line normative research expect mean 50 standard deviation 10 . The analysis compare change emotional behavioral difficulty child use CBCL scale perform intention-to-treat analysis . Baseline comparability across trial arm use CBCL subscales assess subject address comparability randomization assignment . The statistical significance change total CBCL score baseline 9-month follow-up , within control intervention group separately , calculate use test normally distribute outcome measure . If baseline disparity across treatment arm identify , also perform linear regression analysis allow adjustment baseline disparity . Data safety monitoring plan The quality data collection management monitor throughout trial . The use mobile technology result several advantage term data quality management include : build algorithm skip pattern ensure data collect accuracy , consistency integrity ; 'real time ' transmission data collect field Africa Centre Data Centre , ensure rapid data cleaning . A Data Safety Monitoring Board establish term reference agree .</detailed_description>
