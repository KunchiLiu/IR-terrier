	<brief_summary>When certain area brain injured , like stroke , several event occur . One side body may become weak . This weakness call hemiparesis may create difficulty perform task like writing , eat , walk . The weakness result two source : 1. death brain cell affected side ( hemisphere ) brain 2. exaggerated inhibitory signal unaffected hemisphere act survive neuron affect hemisphere . Investigators change neuron die may able change exaggerate inhibition impairs survive neuron affect hemisphere.The purpose study try decrease exaggerated inhibition come unaffected hemisphere , suppresses affect hemisphere , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . Investigators hypothesize , admission discharge , active rTMS combine conventional therapy produce great functional gain paretic hand compare sham rTMS combine conventional therapy , measure standard test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause long-term disability United States people stroke deserve maximum effort restore much function possible ; yet , mainstream stroke rehabilitation remain mired traditional treatment approach may suboptimal . However , past 5 year endeavor advance stroke rehabilitation include noninvasive brain stimulation . This study explore whether safety functional result noninvasive brain stimulation patient chronic stroke give researcher laboratory set replicate acute stroke give trained clinician real-world clinical setting . As background , phenomenon stroke compensatory overuse non-stroke hemisphere inhibit survive neuron stroke hemisphere . In way , people stroke `` doubly disabled '' - first , stroke , second , exaggerated interhemispheric inhibition ( IHI ) arise non-stroke hemisphere act survive neuron non-stroke hemisphere . Investigators bring kill neuron back life up-regulate survive neuron suppress IHI . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) noninvasive way . rTMS yet enter mainstream clinical use stroke , likely explore acute rehabilitation set application clinician . With prior National Institutes Health funding , Dr. Carey considerable experience use rTMS laboratory set chronic stroke . He take rTMS lab real-world set Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute ( CKRI ) , primary referral center acute stroke rehabilitation region , clinician train rTMS . Five daily rTMS treatment ( active sham ) give non-stroke primary motor area ( M1 ) . After treatment , patient receive conventional rehabilitation training . This approach innovative rTMS parameter use application give trained clinician oversight Principal Investigator , oppose laboratory researcher . Expected outcomes improved hand function major adverse effect . Data serve springboard large clinical trial . Specific Aim # 1 : Determine safety 5 treatment 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS combine conventional therapy adult acute stroke . Adverse effect measure observation seizure , investigator screening , physician exam , test cognitive function motor function nonparetic hand . Investigators hypothesize ) seizure , b ) cognitive decline c ) motor decline . Specific Aim # 2 : Compare effectiveness active vs. sham rTMS functional outcome adult acute stroke . Adults acute stroke randomized receive either active rTMS sham rTMS . Both group also receive conventional therapy , consist normal rehabilitation use rehabilitation center . Investigators hypothesize , admission discharge , active rTMS produce great functional gain paretic hand compare sham rTMS , measure standard test .</detailed_description>
