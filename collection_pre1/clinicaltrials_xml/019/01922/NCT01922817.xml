	<brief_summary>Ninety year ago discovery insulin development drug revolutionize management type 1 diabetes , point almost inevitably proven fatal . However , rapidly recognize like `` wonder '' drug problem insulin . Elliot Joslin , one pioneer diabetes therapy describe insulin `` â€¦a potent preparation alike evil good '' ( 1922 ) . There two major reason . Firstly , non-diabetic individual insulin produce pancreas act directly liver , major organ regulate blood glucose level . In contrast , people type 1 diabetes inject insulin skin , absorb circulation much degrade ( ~50 % ) get liver . This mean order act effectively liver type 1 diabetic need inject least double amount insulin . Many study show high insulin level lead weight gain , accelerate blood vessel disease ( atherosclerosis ) high risk suffer low blood glucose ( hypoglycaemia ) . A second major problem individual type 1 show high level hormone , glucagon . Glucagon also produce pancreas normally regulate pancreatic insulin , loss effect people type 1 diabetes mean run high glucagon level . This show increase blood glucose , particularly meal . It diabetes community call novel therapy reduce high insulin level high glucagon level . A new class drug call dipeptidylpeptidase IV inhibitor ( DPPIVi ) currently use treat people type 2 diabetes . DPPIV inhibition increase endogenous level glucagon like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) . These drug number action relevant application directly suppress glucagon , induce satiety ( i.e . reduce hunger lead reduction body weight ) indirectly reduce need high dose insulin injection . This make ideal candidate drug insulin spar adjunct therapy type 1 diabetes , limit data date use . We would like run small , pilot , randomise , cross trial investigates potential DPPIVi therapy reduce insulin requirement type 1 diabetes . We would like investigate see drug reduces daily insulin dos , lead weight reduction , reduces blood glucose fluctuation improve glucose control . Through reduction blood glucose variability , want investigate , whether capability improve magnitude epinephrine responses 2.5mmol/L perform hyperinsulinaemic , hypoglycaemia clamp study arm . A successful outcome would lead application fund large , multicentre intervention study . The benefit therapeutic advance clear potential make dramatic improvement live people type 1 diabetes community .</brief_summary>
