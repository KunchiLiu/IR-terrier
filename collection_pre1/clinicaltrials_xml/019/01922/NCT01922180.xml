	<brief_title>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease : CT Features Severe Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The natural course COPD associate episode exacerbation clinically define acute event characterize worsen patient 's respiratory symptom beyond normal day-to-day variation lead change medication . Moreover , episode classify mild , moderate , severe exacerbation , follow patient 's need medical environment . While cause one-third severe exacerbation episode identify , two-thirds associate certain condition respiratory tract infection ( viral bacterial ) , air pollution , well pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , pulmonary edema , cardiac arrhythmia , pneumothorax , pleural effusion . As COPD exacerbation associate increased morbidity mortality , well increase healthcare cost , prevention treatment two major objective COPD management subsequent requirement appropriate assessment tool . As image tool , chest radiography limited detection pneumonia pleural abnormality , lead change management marginal proportion patient . However , Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan allows detect chest abnormality , knowledge CT feature time exacerbation pre-requisite determine possible role CT routine work-up exacerbation . Nevertheless feature remain widely unknown , previous study focus prevalence PE . The aim study therefore describe feature compare CT scan perform severe exacerbation control scan .</detailed_description>
