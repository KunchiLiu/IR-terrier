	<brief_summary>Frailty clinical entity associate increase risk disease death become common people age . Frailty strong relationship age-related loss muscle strength , term sarcopenia . Sarcopenia frailty strongly associate disability , especially woman . Adequate protein intake , amino acid leucine , resistance exercise training individually show increase muscle mass vary degree . However , study investigate longer-term resistance exercise training program leucine supplementation protein intake optimize could increase muscle mass frail pre-frail elderly woman . In addition , population stand gain intervention . The purpose study investigate effect amino acid leucine add resistance exercise training muscle mass physical performance frail pre-frail elderly woman adequate protein intake . We hypothesize combine leucine diet exercise program would superior exercise alone stimulate muscle protein synthesis phosphorylation status muscle cellular key-regulatory protein , lead enhanced gain muscle performance . A total 24 subject take part study , conduct McGill University Health Centre ( MUHC ) Royal Victoria Hospital Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal ( IUGM ) . All subject undergo adjustment diet optimize protein intake resistance exercise training program . Half participant receive supplement powder leucine ( amino acid ) , half participant receive placebo powder form . Neither participant study investigator know participant receive leucine receive placebo . Each subject participation study involve 4 total visit : 2 initial screen visit follow 2 two-day stay Centre Innovative Medicine ( CIM ) MUHC-Royal Victoria Hospital . These two stay space 12 week intervention ( dietary adjustment , resistance exercise training , powdered supplement ) . The two stay consist meal test ass subject metabolic response meal , obtain muscle biopsy necessary measure rate protein accumulation muscle . Simple physical performance measurement take completion intervention . This study aim well understand presence age affect body 's response resistance exercise leucine , one amino acid make protein , may help build muscle . This turn , could lead define combined diet exercise strategy prevent muscle loss often see age .</brief_summary>
