	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 give together local radiation therapy treat patient newly diagnose diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma . WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray , gamma ray , neutron , proton , source kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 local radiation therapy may work well local radiation therapy alone treat diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose schedule WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 ( Wee1 inhibitor AZD1775 [ MK-1775 ] ) administer concurrently radiation therapy child newly diagnose diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) . II . To define describe toxicity WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 ( AZD1775 [ MK-1775 ] ) give concurrently radiation therapy child newly diagnose DIPG . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) child newly diagnose DIPG . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) within confines phase 1 study , include response rate , progression free survival , overall survival treat patient . II . To assess biologic activity AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) measure expression phosphorylated-cell division cycle 2 G1 S G2 M ( p-CDC2 ) ( cyclin-dependent kinase 1 [ CDK1 ] ) phosphorylated-histone H3 ( p-HH3 ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) administration AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) child newly diagnose DIPG . III . To assess biologic activity AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) measure expression gamma-H2A histone family , member X ( H2AX ) PBMCs , marker deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) double-strand break ( dsDNA ) , administration AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) child newly diagnose DIPG . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 . Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 day week 6 week ( 30 fraction ) . Patients also receive WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 orally ( PO ) day 1-5 week 1 , 3 , 5 ; day 1-5 week 1 , 3 , 5 AND day 1 , 3 , 5 week 2 , 4 , 6 ; OR day 1-5 week 1-6 depend dose level assignment . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 2 month 6 month , every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
