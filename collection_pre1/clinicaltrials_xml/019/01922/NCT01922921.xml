	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect vaccine therapy without polysaccharide-K see well work treat patient stage IV human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) positive breast cancer receive HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy . Vaccines make HER2 intracellular domain ( ICD ) peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell express HER2 . Polysaccharide-K may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . It yet know whether vaccine therapy work well give without polysaccharide-K treat breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Polysaccharide-K Treating Patients With Stage IV HER2 Positive Breast Cancer Receiving HER2-Targeted Monoclonal Antibody Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety polysaccharide-K ( PSK ) give HER2-directed immunotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect PSK natural killer ( NK ) cell functional activity give HER2-directed immunotherapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate effect PSK give HER2-directed immunotherapy : serum level pro-inflammatory cytokine and/or chemokines ; intermolecular epitope spreading ; serum transform growth factor ( TGF ) -beta level ; progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine intradermally ( ID ) monthly 3 month , trastuzumab ( trastuzumab pertuzumab ) per standard care , placebo orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 4 month . ARM II : Patients receive HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine ID trastuzumab ( trastuzumab pertuzumab ) Arm I polysaccharide-K PO BID 4 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 9 month twice annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
