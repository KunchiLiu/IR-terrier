	<criteria>Patients must histologic cytologic evidence solid neoplasm standard therapy available , progress despite standard therapy , intolerant standard therapy . Patients must evidence recurrent , locally advanced , metastatic disease . Patients either prior anticancer therapy , multiple line either prior chemotherapy/biologic therapy/experimental therapy , patient anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) positive nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , prior crizotinib . Patients must predict life expectancy 3 month . Patients must presence least 1 lesion measurable evaluable use RECIST v1.1 . Patients must ECOG performance score 0 , 1 , 2 . Patients central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases allow study . Patients may receive surgical and/or radiation treatment . The metastasis must neurologically stable , corticosteroid . Patients low level , asymptomatic brain lesion require surgical/radiation intervention acutely . Patients symptomatic lesion impend neurologic compromise appropriately treat high dose steroids/radiation may reevaluate study neurologically stable . Patients must complete prior anticancer treatment must recover acute toxicity . The period last dose prior treatment first dose study drug treatment must least 1 week radiotherapy least 2 3 week modality therapy include chemotherapy , monoclonal antibody therapy , immunotherapy , investigational drug , kinase inhibitor . Other criterion apply . The patient ongoing active infection require parenteral antibiotic . The patient uncontrolled hypertension despite adequate therapy ( ie , systolic blood pressure high 150 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure high 90 mm Hg find 2 separate occasion separate 1 week ) . The patient uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( despite therapeutic intervention ) occurrence 2 episode ketoacidosis 12 month prior first dose study drug . The patient active second malignancy curatively resect basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ carcinoma cervix , cancer treat curative intent , know active disease 3 year prior enrollment . The patient primary brain tumor . Patients may brain metastasis another primary site . The patient QTcF interval great 450 msec , know history QTcF prolongation , take medication know prolong QTcF , history torsade de pointes . The patient prior ALKinhibitorrelated toxicity prior therapyrelated acute toxicity resolve prior first dose study drug . Other criterion apply .</criteria>
