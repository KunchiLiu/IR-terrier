	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine ( FLT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) measure treatment response patient newly diagnose estrogen receptor ( ER ) -positive , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative stage I-III breast cancer . Comparing result diagnostic procedure do hormone therapy may help doctor predict patient 's response treatment help plan best treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FLT PET Measuring Treatment Response Patients With Newly Diagnosed Estrogen Receptor-Positive , HER2-Negative Stage I-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure effect short course endocrine therapy primary breast cancer metabolism proliferation measure change serial FLT PET measure pre post short course endocrine therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare change image measure tissue measure response , particular antigen identify proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen ( Ki-67 ) , pre-therapy biopsy versus post-therapy surgical specimen . II . Correlate image measure measure gene expression pre post therapy assay determine molecular change associate early response therapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo FLT PET baseline 1-6 week start treatment .</detailed_description>
