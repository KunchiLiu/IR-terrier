	<brief_title>A Study Subcutaneously Administered Herceptin ( Trastuzumab ) Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -Positive Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In run-in phase , participant receive trastuzumab intravenously every 3 week 18 week ( Cycles 1-6 ) . They first receive trastuzumab 8 mg/kg ( Cycle 1 ) follow trastuzumab 6 mg/kg 5 time 15 week ( Cycles 2-6 ) . Participants could also receive maximum 6 cycle standard chemotherapy early breast cancer ( neo-adjuvant adjuvant ) run-in phase . Following run-in phase , participant randomize receive trastuzumab 600 mg subcutaneously every 3 week thigh upper arm cross-over design total 24 week ( Cycles 7-14 ) . They receive trastuzumab either thigh first 4 cycle ( Cycles 7-10 ) follow trastuzumab upper arm 4 cycle ( Cycles 11-14 ) upper arm first ( Cycles 7-10 ) follow thigh ( Cycles 11-14 ) . For Cycles 15-18 , participant could choose injection site trastuzumab 600 mg subcutaneously every 3 week .</detailed_description>
