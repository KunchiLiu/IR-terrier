	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness investigational Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) OCT angiography management proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR - lead cause blindness diabetic patient ) treatment . Angiography map blood vessel , Doppler detect blood flow . PDR due poor oxygen circulation small blood vessel back eye ( retina ) , observe 80 % people diabetes 10 year . This study look blood flow eye affect treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) refers change blood vessel retina associate long-term diabetes mellitus . These change find patient Type I II diabetes . DR lead cause blindness United States . It categorize either non-proliferative ( NPDR ) proliferative ( PDR ) . In PDR progress , lack oxygen retina cause fragile , new blood vessel grow along retina clear , gel-like vitreous humour . Without timely treatment , new vessel bleed , cloud vision , destroy retina . So , PDR classify either existence retinal neovascularization vitreous pre-retinal hemorrhage . PDR typically treat laser , know panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) , create 1,600-2,000 burn retina reduce retinal oxygen demand , reduce possibility ischemia , injection anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) drug vitreous , always need multiple injection . In case severe bleeding , vitrectomy may perform local anesthesia . However , eye patch medicate eye drop always need operation protect infection outcome always good expect . PDR currently diagnose comprehensive eye exam include visual acuity test , ophthalmoscopy fundus photography , fluorescein angiography ( FA ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . If PDR think require treatment , subsequent assessment disease severity treatment planning utilizes FA . FA require injection sodium fluorescein systemic circulation . However , 1 3 people adverse reaction sodium fluorescein , include nausea , vomit , hive , acute hypotension . Severe reaction anaphylaxis relate anaphylactoid reaction , cause cardiac arrest sudden death due anaphylactic shock , also report . Finally , risk sodium fluorescein develop fetus unknown , use pregnant woman contraindicate . Replacing FA less invasive well tolerate method would reduce risk patient population . One option OCT angiography . Optical coherence tomography image technology perform non-contact cross-sectional imaging tissue structure real time . It number feature make attractive diagnostic imaging modality : 1 ) It micron-level resolution , possible non-contact technique ; 2 ) No potentially allergenic dye contrast agent require ; 3 ) OCT image generate electronic form , facilitate use digital image processing technique extract quantitative parameter regard imaged tissue anatomy . For reason , structural OCT already routinely used ass early stage DR ( NPDR ) image area macular edema response treatment . Novel functional OCT include Doppler OCT OCT angiography may allow assessment retinal blood flow alleviate need invasive FA test . Thus , diagnostic data provide functional OCT least equivalent superior achieve FA , patient healthcare provider could realize substantial benefit utilize technology management PDR evaluation PRP . Therefore , propose pilot study evaluate feasibility Doppler OCT measure total retinal blood flow ass global retinal ischemia PRP treatment OCT angiography retina ass proliferative change management PDR subject comparison standard FA . Functional OCT data ( Doppler OCT OCT angiography ) acquire use Swept Source-OCT ( SS-OCT ) depth resolution 5 micron ultrafast scan rate 100 kHz allow u obtain detailed 3D OCT image . OCT angiography performs noninvasive microcirculation measurement visualization option commercially available OCT system . Though FDA-approved , SS-OCT prototype satisfies American national standard laser safety ( ANSI ) safety requirement . The power level low enough classified non-significant risk device .</detailed_description>
