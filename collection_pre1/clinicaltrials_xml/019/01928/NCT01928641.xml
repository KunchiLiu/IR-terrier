	<brief_summary>Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator ( IV t-PA ) proven treatment hyperacute cerebral infarction . The outcome treatment highly depend time symptom onset administration thrombolytic agent . Last known normal time widely use standard determine symptom onset . These stroke symptom usually cause sudden decrease cerebral blood flow relate embolic thrombotic event . However , case various symptom may occur one another . Myocardial infarction also cause sudden caseation blood flow . The symptom myocardial infarction usually contain chest pain , easy identify exact time onset . In contrast , cerebral infarction may cause various symptom accord infarcted area brain , sometimes multiple symptom present rapid succession . Therefore , may much unclear uncertain determine onset time cerebral infarction . Despite importance onset time therapeutic decision making , study focus certainty onset time cerebral infarction patient . In study , investigate subjective certainty patient onset time clear-onset cerebral ischemia . The discrepancy diagnose onset time analyze among clinician involve practice . Then , factor associate uncertainty verify .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Certainty Of Stroke Symptom Onset Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On day admission , patient re-interviewed stroke neurologist round morning . First history symptom onset re-taken , focus presentation neurological symptom . Then history take emergency department include onset time present patient , patient ask choose certainty onset time 1 5 . The symptom onset judge neurologist first assess emergency department compare stroke neurologist re-interviewed admission . If discrepancy exists , history patient re-written stroke neurologist review five experienced stroke neurologist . The judgment stroke onset certainty stroke neurologist compare . Clinical variable obtain patient . The informant patient . Demographics include age sex obtain . Additionally year education investigate . The situation stroke onset obtain detail . What patient immediately onset , place , person accompany also investigate . These describe re-written history review five stroke neurologist . The conventional risk factor stroke stroke etiology accord TOAST classification acquire . The initial severity stroke also obtain evaluate National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) . On second interview re-written history , symptom investigate detail . First open question , target stroke symptom onset ask . The symptom include 1 ) weakness , 2 ) facial palsy 3 ) dysarthria 4 ) ataxia 5 ) visual field defect 6 ) sensory change 7 ) dizziness 8 ) headache 9 ) Other non-specific symptom . The onset time sequence investigate symptom . The result analyze two view point . First discrepancy rate clinician first examine , clinical variable make difference analyze . finally protocol systemized history take stroke onset use , change analyze release protocol . In second point veiw , certainty patient analyze . The clinical variable compare accord certainty patient symptom onset .</detailed_description>
