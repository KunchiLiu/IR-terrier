	<detailed_description>VA Cooperative Study CSP # 591 design compare effectiveness Prolonged Exposure Cognitive Processing Therapy treat posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) male female Veterans . PTSD serious prevalent condition Veterans , affect 9 % VA patient FY11 . Since 2005 , number VA patient PTSD increase 14.8 % annually , due new Veterans also increase number Vietnam Veterans seek care . In FY11 , PTSD 3rd common service-connected disability VA . Despite solid evidence Prolonged Exposure Cognitive Processing Therapy effective treatment PTSD Veterans non-Veterans , insufficient evidence effectiveness treatment relative one another . The study compare treatment , single-site trial non-Veteran female rape survivor , fail find difference , study adequately power compare two effective treatment . Other data similarly inconclusive . CSP # 591 would break new ground first large-scale comparative effectiveness trial treatment PTSD first study provide definitive information effective treatment PTSD compare one another . The study prospective randomize clinical trial blind assessment . The population male female Veterans PTSD due traumatic military event . Patients eligible agree participate study randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive Prolonged Exposure Cognitive Processing Therapy . The investigator propose administer 12 weekly session treatment standard `` dose '' allow participant improve rapidly finish 10 11 session participant attain adequate improvement session 12 2 additional session . The primary outcome improvement PTSD symptom severity measure change Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale treatment . The outcome measure determine regular follow-up visit patient , occur middle end treatment 3 6 month later . Secondary outcome include measure PTSD , comorbid mental health problem , function , quality life , service utilization . The investigator also measure participant ' treatment preference examine whether concordance preference allocation associate increase treatment effectiveness . In order detect standardize mean difference improvement PTSD symptom severity = .25 , sample size 900 randomized patient provide 90 % power detect difference arm use linear mixed effect model two-sided = .05 . Given lack conclusive finding predict treatment better , investigator propose test nondirectional hypothesis . Assuming 2.5 year accrual enrollment 26 participant per year site , investigator would need 14.1 site enroll total 64 participant per site . The investigator propose recruit 17 site guard possibility site enroll require number participant . VA vested interest understand relative effectiveness Prolonged Exposure Cognitive Processing Therapy . Both treatment recommend high level VA/DoD PTSD Practice Guideline . VA require make treatment available Veterans seek PTSD care . The treatment disseminate nationally across VA system order enhance availability evidence-based treatment Veterans PTSD . VA also develop national PTSD Mentoring Program PTSD Program Administrators help manage clinic permit delivery treatment . Every facility evidence-based therapy coordinator well facilitate train evidence-based psychotherapy . As large multi-site trial men woman , CSP # 591 would provide definitive information comparative effectiveness Prolonged Exposure Cognitive Processing Therapy maximize study 's impact field . Because treatment base differ theory development PTSD , demonstration one treatment superior would scientific exploration challenge theoretical account etiology treatment . Regardless treatment well , patient would information help make informed decision treatment choose VA would stronger evidence help make care Veteran-centered .</detailed_description>
