	<brief_summary>To diagnose acid base disturbance use blood gas analysis , multiple approach currently use . These include classic Henderson-Hasselbach bicarbonate approach physiochemical approach Stewart1 . All show mathematically compatible2 . Diagnosing metabolic component acid base disturbances relies assessment call ion gap : anion gap classic acid-base approach strong ion difference ( SID ) Stewart approach . This gap may unveil unidentified anion provide accurate diagnosis . In particular allow differentiate relative hyperchloremia strong ion lactate , ketone , salicylate , citrate ethylene glycol3 . The accuracy gaps relies estimation weak acid dissociation : A- . This A- dependent total concentration weak acid ( Atot ) albumin important effective dissociation constant ( Ka ) , determines dissociate fraction Atot . This dissociation fraction need account ion gap . This reflected recommendation correct anion gap albumin incorporate SID include factor albumin design3,4 . However , correction factor albumin currently base data animal healthy volunteers4-9 . In critically ill albumin protein content different compare healthy volunteer , notably sepsis . Further , unknown subunit composition albumin different patient . In addition , different protein specie may either downregulated critically ill1,8,9.Therefore pathophysiological point view Atot Ka thus A- may differ critically ill . However previously investigate extent matter affect Atot Ka therefore A- population . In addition , previous study look value show higher expect value unmeasured anion gap calculation . Despite rigorous experimental effort include high performance liquid chromatography , origin unmeasured anion yet elucidated17-20 . However assumption make Stewarts approach would valid , existence unknown anion may question . Thus great interest experimentally determine exact contribution weak acid dissociation sepsis . This could major implication patient different assumption ultimately lead alteration calculate anion gap SID . This may reduce unnecessary diagnostic test , alter final diagnosis hence alter therapy . In study investigator aim experimentally determine Atot Ka thus dissociate fraction A- critically ill septic patient admit intensive care unit use vitro CO2 tonometry , plasma dialysis Marquardt regression analysis . In addition , control investigator patient admit intensive care routine cardiac surgery . Furthermore Atot Ka value group compare value obtain human volunteer previous study4 . To achieve , investigator plot CO2 versus pH titration curve plasma sample patient . The investigator use Marquardt nonlinear regression analysis quantify Atot Ka SID simultaneously solve parameters21 . To make quantification Atot Ka robust , investigator also perform experiment dialyze obtain plasma sample crystalloid solution know composition order eliminate error related estimation SID . Finally , Atot Ka value group compare value obtain human volunteer previous study4 . For application bicarbonate base excess centre framework , Atot Ka value relate albumin protein content update correction factor anion gap critically ill .</brief_summary>
