	<brief_summary>Observational evidence finding clinical trial conduct reason suggest lithium , drug use treatment bipolar disorder , , less extent , depression , may reduce rate suicide suicide attempt . However , hypothesis yet adequately examine randomized clinical trial conduct specifically test lithium 's efficacy prevent suicide . This clinical trial fill gap . This study feasible within Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) large , integrate health system exist program identify patient risk suicide deliver enhance service . In VA , approximately 12,000 patient depression bipolar disorder survive suicide attempt relate behavior year , 15 % repeat within one year . Experimental treatment study supplement usual care major depression bipolar disorder , well VA 's standard , enhanced management patient high risk . The investigator recruit 1862 study participant , approximately 30 VA Hospitals . Participants patient bipolar disorder depression survive recent episode suicidal self-directed violence hospitalize specifically prevent suicide . Randomly , half receive lithium , half receive placebo . Neither patient doctor know whether particular person receive lithium placebo . The treatment administer patient follow one year , patient go back usual care . Recruitment occur 3 year . The investigator primarily interested whether lithium lead increase time first repeat episode suicidal behavior , include suicide attempt , interrupt attempt , hospitalization specifically prevent suicide , death suicide . In addition , study allow u explore whether lithium decrease total number suicidal behavior , whether comparable effect impulsive non-impulsive behavior . If effect lithium , investigator interest whether could attribute improved control underlie mental health condition , , alternatively , whether represent direct effect suicide-related behavior .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To test hypothesis lithium augmentation enhance usual care reduce rate repeat episode suicidal self-directed violence ( repeat suicide attempt , interrupt attempt , hospitalization specifically prevent suicide , death suicide ) participant bipolar disorder depression survive recent event . Background : The hypothesis lithium prevent suicide patient bipolar disorder depression base data observational study randomize clinical trial conduct evaluate outcome . The question effectiveness lithium suicide prevention one major scientific , clinical , public health significance . There adequately power clinical trial conduct specifically evaluate suicide behavior outcome . Two recent randomize clinical trial fail recruit adequate number subject conclusive . The VHA , large national healthcare system establish program identify new suicide attempt , evaluate patient underlie mental health medical condition , provide need service , connect Veterans state-of-the-art suicide risk management , monitor outcome uniquely able conduct large scale clinical trial lithium suicide prevention . The rationale study base follow : - Data observational study double-blind randomized clinical trial suggest lithium prevent suicide-related behavior patient bipolar disorder major depression . - The high risk suicide Veterans receive health care service VHA persist despite extensive improvement mental health service program suicide prevention . - Each month , 1,100 unique VHA patient bipolar disorder depression attempt suicide survive . - Surviving suicide attempt powerful know risk factor death suicide VA elsewhere . - Approximately 15 % VA survivor reattempt die suicide within one year . - Evaluating rate reattempts survive attempt establish effective method test intervention may prevent suicide . - Experimental treatment CSP-590 would supplement usual care major depression bipolar disorder . - Study procedure management suicide risk would meet exceed VA standard requirement . - Study procedure optimize safety lithium , include potential risk overdoses , meet exceed publish practice standard . The trial utilize multiple strategy minimize risk include frequent monitoring assessment , determination lithium level titration steady state , dispense medication limited quantity blister pack . - The investigator 's survey VA psychiatrists indicate question clinically important compel clinical trial demonstrate hypothesized effect would transform clinical management suicidality . Design : Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial lithium versus placebo augmentation enhance usual care . Patient population : VHA patient bipolar disorder depression survive recent episode suicidal self-directed violence . Primary outcome : Time first repeat episode suicidal self-directed violence , include suicide attempt , interrupt attempt , hospitalization specifically prevent suicide , death suicide Duration : Total study duration 4.5 year . Recruitment occur 3 year . Participants follow one year . Sample size calculation number site require : The design study base test 37 % reduction rate repeat suicidal self-directed violence , figure base effect size approximately 43 % observed recent study allow attenuation due non-adherence . Adjusting potential data loss due attrition , 90 % statistical power detect significant 37 % reduction reattempt rate 5 % overall type I error would require 1862 subject . With recruitment 20 % eligible subject three year period , would require approximately 9310 potentially eligible subject . Based current suicide surveillance data , could achieve 29 site .</detailed_description>
