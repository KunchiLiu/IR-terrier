	<criteria>1 . Be male female subject ≥ 18 year age . 2 . If female 1. subject childbearing potential , must document use use effective contraceptive method ( IUD , hormonal birth control , condom spermicidal jelly , etc . ) study , Contraception must use least 2 month start study . A documented negative urine pregnancy test must provide subject must nonlactating . 2. subject nonchildbearing potential , must postmenopausal ( i.e . amenorrhea minimum 12 consecutive month ) surgically sterile due bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy . 3. subject truly abstinent . This accept method contraception , line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g . calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . 3 . If male , agree use reliable birth control method ( contraception barrier device ) study participation . 4 . Must complicate low urinary tract infection acute complicate uncomplicated pyelonephritis ( cPN uPN ; see section 5.3 ) must least two follow acute sign symptom 1 . Chills rigor warmth associate fever ( e.g . oral temperature great 38.0 degree Celsius ) . 2 . Flank pain ( pyelonephritis ) pelvic pain ( cUTI ) . 3 . Nausea vomit . 4 . Dysuria , urinary frequency , urinary urgency . 5 . Costovertebral angle tenderness ( pyelonephritis ) physical examination . 5 . Provide one pretreatment adequate urine sample ( urine sample must return positive culture order subject remain eligible study ) For male : midstream clean catch , female : inout catheterisation midstream clean catch . The urine sample must provide within 24 hour start administration first dose study drug . A positive urine culture define : ≥ 105 CFU/mL one causative pathogen case cUTI ≥ 104 CFU/mL one causative pathogen case Pyelonephritis A negative urine culture define : &lt; 105 CFU/mL causative pathogen/s and/or nontarget pathogens number CFUs case cUTI &lt; 104 CFU/mL causative pathogen/s and/or nontarget pathogens number CFUs case Pyelonephritis Patients may admit study pending baseline urine culture result . Treatment NOT delay pending urine culture result . NOTE : Because biofilms indwell catheter ( e.g . Foley catheter ) likely present catheter place period time , sample collect follow placement new catheter . If placement new catheter contraindicate feasible , specimen collect use aseptic technique urine obtain properly disinfect collection port . Urine sample never obtain collection bag . If subject 's pretreatment culture show presence ciprofloxacin resistant pathogen Investigator decide accord clinical sign symptom whether subject stay study . In event negative urine culture , subject must withdraw study switch standard care , inclusion criterion fulfil . A urine culture define contaminate : least one causative pathogen ≥ 105 CFU/mL present AND least one nonpathogen additional causative pathogen/s number CFU/mL present case cUTI least one causative pathogen ≥ 104 CFU/mL present AND least one nonpathogen additional causative pathogen/s number CFU/mL case pyelonephritis Subjects contaminate urine culture permit continue study , although impact subject 's eligibility analysis ( see section 9.3 ) . 6 . Have pyuria ( i.e . dipstick analysis positive leukocyte esterase least 10 white blood cell per cubic millimetre [ 1 µl ] ) . 7 . Be consider ill enough hospitalize least 3 day require initial parenteral therapy manage cUTI and/or acute pyelonephritis standard care . 8 . Provide write informed consent participate study . 9 . Be willing able comply study procedures activity . 1 . Uncomplicated cystitis female . 2 . Failed previous antibiotic treatment within last 4 week due culture confirm fluoroquinolone resistant pathogen . 3 . Having ileal loop , urinary diversion bowel segment suspect confirmed vesicoureteral reflux , suspect confirm perinephric intrarenal abscess ( abscess suspect ultrasound perform confirm exclude ) . 4 . History renal transplant permanent complicate factor urinary tract ( include complete obstruction , suspect confirmed prostatitis epididymitis ) effectively treat therapy infection . 5 . Indwelling urinary catheter expect remain place therapy complete . 6 . The urinary tract infection concomitant bacterial infection require systemic antibiotic therapy ( addition study treatment ) time randomisation . Antibiotics grampositive activity permit . 7 . Any infection , opinion Investigator , would consider intractable likely require 10 day study drug therapy . 8 . Any recent use ( e.g. , within 48 hour first dose study medication ) antimicrobial therapy drug activity treatment urinary tract infection . 9 . Having expose fluoroquinolone 30 day Day 1 ( study enrolment ) , previous participation finafloxacin clinical trial participation within last 30 day clinical study general . 10 . In 12 month study enrolment : know uncontrolled condition hypertension symptomatic hypotension , know uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , know ischaemic heart disease history myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass surgery percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . 11 . Significantly immunocompromised ( define WBC &lt; 1000 ) and/or know infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV/AIDS ) , haematological malignancy , bone marrow transplantation , current immunosuppressive therapy ( include limited cancer chemotherapy , medication prevention organ transplantation rejection ) . 12 . Any concomitant psychiatric , neurological behavioural disorder , include epilepsy lesion central nervous system sufficient opinion Investigator prevent compromise subject 's participation study . 13 . Any known concomitant bacterial fungal sexually transmit disease exception candidiasis . 14 . Having , opinion Investigator , clinically significant serious unstable physical illness likely impact subject 's wellbeing conduct analysis study , include , limited , acute hepatic failure , respiratory failure , severe , persistent diarrhoea septic shock . 15 . Any surgical medical condition might interfere distribution , metabolism excretion drug , include , limited moderate ( include estimate creatinine clearance 30 59 mL/min ) severe impairment renal function ( include estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min ) , requirement peritoneal dialysis , haemodialysis haemofiltration , oliguria . 16 . Any malignant disease history malignant neoplasm require treatment immune suppressive property 6 month baseline . 17 . Known history drug abuse . 18 . Clinically abnormal haematology , biochemistry urinalysis result baseline include , limited : AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase level great 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Total bilirubin great 2 time ULN . WBC count less 1000/μL , platelet count less 50,000/μL . Haematocrit le 25 % . Creatinine clearance &lt; 60mL/minute . 19 . Any clinically significant ECG abnormality baseline ECG subject risk torsade de pointes arrhythmia history significant inadequately treated cardiac disease . 20 . Documented history hypersensitivity allergy know contraindication use fluoroquinolones . 21 . Any history tendon lesion rupture either quinolone treatment reason . 22 . Concomitant tizanidine use . 23 . Any administration corticosteroid equivalent great 20 mg prednisone per day 14 day randomisation . 24 . The subject , plan enrol employee relative involve study Investigator involve institution include MerLion Galenus . 25 . Life expectancy le 3 month . 26 . Women pregnant nursing . 27 . Any condition , opinion Investigator , would prevent subject effectively participate study , place subject risk affect assessment efficacy safety study medication .</criteria>
