Cognitive theory suggest immediate incentive exerts influence delay reward implement patient preference ( Berns , Laibson , &amp; Loewenstein , 2007 ) . Some critic echo consider reward participant abstinent achieve cessation outcomes early stage quit process , instead late cessation outcome ( Aveyard &amp; Bauld , 2011 ) . Among three overseas study attempt combine short-term monetary reward competition incentive abstinence ( Glasgow , Hollis , Ary , &amp; Boles , 1993 ; Hennrikus , Jeffery , Lando , &amp; Murray , 2002 ; Koffman , Lee , Hopp , &amp; Emont , 1998 ) , Koffman 's study workplace support participant short-term incentive higher quit rate 6 month others without incentive . In 2009 , conduct 3-armed randomized control trial compare effectiveness two additional intervention 3-minute brief telephone advice 8 mobile phone message usual care smoke cessation self-help material Quit Win Contest 2009 ( Chan , 2011 ) . More one thousand participant successfully recruit period one half month , overall self-reported quit rate 21.6 % among contestant . However , additional brief telephone advice SMS message show high quit rate control group . In 2010 , conduct another RCT Quit Win Contest 2010 compare effectiveness on-site face-to-face brief smoke cessation advice versus self-help material ( control ) quit rate change smoke behavior . Once , recruit one thousand participant period 2.5 month .

In addition , another SMS intervention group receive 16 SMS cessation advice motivation within one month . The quit rate two intervention group 9.4 % 11.5 % , respectively , differ control group significantly ( 9.7 % ) . The three Quit Win Contests Hong Kong recruit 3,000 smoker community otherwise might even think quit smoke . On hand , engagement competition boost confidence motivation quit among smoker join Quit Win contest , additional counsel short messaging service increase quit rate . All three contest conduct lucky draw select prize winner whose abstinence validate biochemical test .
