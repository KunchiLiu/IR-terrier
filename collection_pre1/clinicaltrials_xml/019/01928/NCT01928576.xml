	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically prove stage IIIB , IV recurrent nonsmall cell lung cancer . Patients must pretreatment tumor specimen available correlative study , either core needle biopsy excisional specimen ( cytology specimen acceptable purpose ) . Patients available archived specimen must willing undergo pretreatment tumor biopsy . 2 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . See Section 11 evaluation measurable disease . 3 . Patients must receive least one platinum base chemotherapy , three , prior therapy stage IIIB/IV disease . 4 . Patients receive adjuvant neoadjuvant platinumdoublet chemotherapy ( surgery and/or radiation therapy ) develop recurrent metastatic disease within 6 month complete therapy eligible adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy count line therapy . 5 . Subjects recurrent disease &gt; 6 month adjuvant neoadjuvant platinumbased chemotherapy , also subsequently progress platinumdoublet regimen give treat recurrence , eligible count another line therapy advance disease . 6 . Subjects receive pemetrexed , bevacizumab , erlotinib maintenance therapy ( nonprogressors platinumbased doublet chemotherapy ) subsequently progress maintenance therapy ) eligible count line therapy . However , subject receive tyrosine kinase inhibitor failure prior platinumbased therapy , tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy would count additional line therapy . 7 . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use azacitidine entinostat , Nivolumab , patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . 8 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . 9 . Life expectancy great 12 week . 10 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function . 11 . The effect entinostat , azacitidine , Nivolumab , develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation 23 week last dose nivolumab . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men sexually active woman childbearing potential must also use adequate contraceptive method 31 week fhe last dose nivolumab . 12 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 13 . Patients document EGFR ALK mutation must treat prior EGFR ALK therapy well platinum contain doublet . 14 . All adenocarcinoma patient test ALK rearrangement EGFR ( Exon 19 Deletion Exon 21 L8585R Substitution ) mutation must treat prior EGFR ALK therapy well platinum contain doublet . 1 . Any active history know autoimmune disease . Subjects vitiligo , type 1 diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism require hormone replacement , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . 2 . Subjects history interstitial lung disease . Patients require continuous supplemental oxygen exclude avoid possible complication pneumonitis . 3 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . 4 . Patients receive anticancer therapy . 5 . Patients uncontrolled brain metastasis . Patients brain metastasis must stable neurologic status follow local therapy ( surgery radiation ) least 2 week without use steroid stable decrease dose &lt; 10mg daily prednisone ( equivalent ) , must without neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients history carcinomatous meningitis eligible . 6 . Patients advance malignant hepatic tumor . 7 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition entinostat , azacitidine , Nivolumab . 8 . Known suspected hypersensitivity azacitidine mannitol 9 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 10 . Pregnant woman exclude study entinostat , azacitidine , Nivolumab agents potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother entinostat , azacitidine , Nivolumab breastfeed discontinue mother treat protocol . 11 . HIVpositive patient exclude . 12 . Patients active hepatitis B hepatitis C exclude . 13 . Patients condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day randomization . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement steroid dose &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent , permit absence active autoimmune disease . 14 . Patients malabsorption small intestine condition would preclude administration oral medication . 15 . Prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCTLA4 antibody therapy , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway , DNA methyltransferase therapy HDAC inhibitor therapy .</criteria>
