	<detailed_description>Participants enrol pilot study randomize receive investigation medication . In collaboration Dr. Sibu Saha , Professor Surgery , University Kentucky , investigator obtain freshly isolated human atherosclerotic tissue patient undergo carotid endarterectomy . The surgical process tissue obtain part research project . These tissue surgically remove patient treatment atherosclerosis carotid artery typically send pathological examination . After clinical pathology complete , investigator obtain analyze small amount discard ( 200mg ) tissue . Subsequent analysis perform basis pathological grading provide UK Pathology ( e.g readout Dicer pathway correlate pathological plaque characteristic ) . Tissue anonymized , information respect drug history , age , gender pathological grade tissue . The extract protein RNA . Dicer abundance assess western blot , quantitative RT-PCR northern blot . Dicer relate RNAs measure quantitative RT-PCR northern blot . The invesigator inspect tissue evidence alter Dicer activity measure relative level abundant canonical Dicer substrates/enzymatic product ( i.e . ratio pre- mature micro-RNA ) via northern blot . The investigator predict Dicer level activity reduce human atherosclerotic tissue compare healthy artery . Next , investigator ass whether downstream mediator Dicer dysregulation activate tissue sample compare level activation inflammasome ( caspase-1 , NLRP3 , ASC ) , cytokine ( IL-1Î² , IL-18 ) signal intermediate ( MyD88 , IRAK1/4 ) healthy diseased tissue . The investigator predict atherosclerotic plaque exhibit evidence Dicer dysregulation . Next , investigator co-stain tissue section antibody recognize Dicer well cell-specific marker ( CD31 endothelium , SMA smooth muscle , MAC-1 macrophage ) assess whether Dicer dysregulation display cell type-specific pattern .</detailed_description>
