	<brief_title>A Single Site , Randomized , Double-blind , Placebo Controlled Trial NIC5-15 Subjects With Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent epidemiologic evidence , suggest diabetes mellitus significantly increase risk development Alzheimer 's disease , independent vascular risk factor . Moreover , even patient simply insulin resistant , without frank diabetes , show share elevate risk development AD . As insulin 's role neuromodulator brain reveal , several potential mechanism interaction diabetes insulin resistance AD suggest decreased cortical glucose utilization particularly hippocampus entorhinal cortex ; increase oxidative stress formation advance glycation end product ; increase Tau phosphorylation neurofibrillary tangle formation ; increase beta-amyloid aggregation inhibition insulin-degrading enzyme . The future treatment AD might involve pharmacologic dietary manipulation insulin glucose regulation NIC5-15 single , small , naturally occur molecule . Animal study human trial show NIC5-15 safe potent insulin sensitizer dose equivalent 800-2000mg per day . In preclinical study dose high previously study clinical trial , find NIC5-15 interferes accumulation beta amyloid , important step development Alzheimer 's pathology . These data suggest NIC5-15 may reasonable therapeutic agent treatment Alzheimer Disease two reason : It -secretase inhibitor Notch-sparing . It potentially insulin-sensitizer . However critical safety human efficacy study must conduct . This application propose conduct early critical human study . The goal study contain proposal establish safety efficacy NIC5-15 treatment AD . The specific objective study : Specific Objective # 1 ) Conduct multiple dose safety study NIC5-15 establish safety dos appear block amyloid accumulation . These study characterize safety profile , pharmacokinetics , tolerability This objective met completion initial study ID # NCT00470418 . The current study continue investigation NIC5-15 Alzheimer 's disease follow objective : Specific Objective # 2 ) Conduct double blind placebo control pilot efficacy study NIC5-15 patient AD . The goal study : A ) Demonstrate feasibility multi-site trial use guide design future large effort . Demonstration feasibility include examination accrual rate , overall recruitment , adherence protocol , compliance medication willingness complete randomize trial , lack short term toxicity . B ) Collect preliminary evidence efficacy term cognitive global measure well secondary efficacy outcome activity daily live , behavioral disturbance AD biomarkers .</detailed_description>
