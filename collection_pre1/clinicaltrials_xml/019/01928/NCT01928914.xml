	<detailed_description>SB-252263 ( tafenoquine , TQ ) new 8-aminoquinoline antimalarial drug develop GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medicines Malaria Venture assistance historical support Walter Reed Army Institute Research . Tafenoquine show effective treatment plasmodial infection vitro , pre-clinical model vivo , early phase clinical study radical cure eradication liver hypnozoites patient infected Plasmodium vivax . This study design compare effect tafenoquine mono-therapy , administer single dose administer 3 consecutive day , change QT duration observe subject dose either Avelox ( moxifloxacin hydrochloride ) placebo . This randomized , single-blind , placebo control , parallel group study . Parallel group design choose tafenoquine long half-life , 14 19 day , therefore cross-over design practical alternative . Moxifloxacin use positive control order validate sensitivity study detect QTc change . Moxifloxacin show prolong QT interval dose-dependent manner patient healthy volunteer , QTc prolongation well quantify .</detailed_description>
