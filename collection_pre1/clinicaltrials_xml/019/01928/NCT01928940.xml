	<detailed_description>This Japanese Phase I/II , open-label , non-controlled study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic profile , efficacy combination GSK2118436 GSK1120212 subject BRAF V600E/K mutation positive advance solid tumor ( Phase I part ) BRAF V600E/K mutation positive cutaneous melanoma ( Phase II part ) . Phase I part design primarily assess safety tolerability GSK2118436 GSK1120212 combination therapy subject BRAF V600E/K mutation positive advance solid tumor . Six evaluable subject enrol Phase I part receive combination therapy GSK2118436 ( 150 mg , twice daily ) GSK1120212 ( 2 mg , daily ) . A decision start Phase II part make careful review base available safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic data Phase I part . Phase II part design primarily evaluate ORR combination first-line therapy subject unresectable ( Stage IIIC ) metastatic ( Stage IV ) BRAF V600E/K mutation positive cutaneous melanoma . Subjects prior systemic anti-cancer treatment advance metastatic set eligible Phase II part although prior systemic treatment adjuvant setting allow . Six evaluable subject enrol Phase II part .</detailed_description>
