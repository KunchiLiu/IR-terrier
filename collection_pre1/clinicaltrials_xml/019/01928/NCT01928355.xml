	<brief_summary>There evidence suggest obesity risk factor development cognitive dysfunction , although universal find . This discordance might ascribe existence 'healthy obese phenotype'- , obesity absence metabolic risk factor . We examine whether association obesity cognitive dysfunction dependent individual 's metabolic health . 60 obese patient ' undergoping liver fibroscan blood test enrol . Obesity define body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2 . Based blood pressure , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , glycated haemoglobin , C-reactive protein , participant classify 'metabolically healthy ' ( 0 1 metabolic abnormality ) 'unhealthy ' ( ≥ 2 metabolic abnormality ) . Cognitive dysfunction assess moca minimental score . Results : Cognitive dysfunction prevalence expect 30 % , 50 % group categorize metabolically healthy . Relative non-obese healthy participant , adjustment baseline covariates , metabolically unhealthy obese participant elevate risk cognitive dysfunction although metabolically healthy obese . The association obesity risk cognitive dysfunction appear partly dependent metabolic health , although work require confirm finding . In obesity increase oxidative stress due metabolic syndrome . Thus obese patient suffer high incidence cardiovascular complication atherosclerosis compare non- obese population . Haptoglobin ( Hp ) plasma protein bind free hemoglobin prevents heme- iron mediate oxidation . There three different type Hp differ antioxidant ability . Several clinical study show Hp 2-2 genotype associate high incidence cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
