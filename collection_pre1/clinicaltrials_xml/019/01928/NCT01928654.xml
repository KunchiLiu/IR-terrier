	<brief_summary>Macular edema important cause visual impairment diabetic patient . Intravitreal injection antiVEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) agent laser treatment two effective therapy stabilise visual acuity . However , antiVEGF therapy expensive potentially need repeated patient life . Laser treatment , accord modify ETDRS ( early treatment diabetic retinopathy study ) , produce retinal burn possible negative consequence alteration visual field . With micropulse treatment modality laser energy deliver short pulse ( `` micropulses '' ) rather continuous wave . In way amount energy deliver retina retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) significantly reduce . This finer control photothermal effect avoid retinal RPE damage . At time , accord several publish report , efficacy treatment appear equivalent conventional laser therapy . Previous study investigate effect 810nm micropulse laser therapy . Recently , treatment modality make available also 577nm wavelength , correspond maximum absorption level blood . Aim study ass safety efficacy 577nm micropulse laser treatment compare conventional modify ETDRS laser therapy .</brief_summary>
