	<brief_summary>The study look systematically neurophysiological neuropsychological component available therapy chronic aphasia highly heterogeneous nature . Results study , unsurprisingly , indicate heterogeneous result , dissimilar neural outcome associate neuropsychological gain . There , therefore , consensus successful therapy— , one produce measurable language gain either production comprehension —impacts functional language network brain specific type aphasia population . A recent study show inner speech ( imagination speech ) involve network area dissociable implicated speech production . Further , behavioural analysis show interesting discrepancy inner speech overt speech ( also call speech production ) small chronic aphasia population : participant elicit poor inner speech couple relatively intact overt speech , others elicit relatively intact inner speech couple poor overt speech . This unexplored discrepancy implies inner speech speech production dissociable , though share similar network . This discrepancy , notion speech component share similar network , drive study 's hypothesis improvement speech production rehabilitation might facilitate intact inner speech network . Much good athlete visualise performance actual event order increase chance success , might intact inner speech facilitate speech production , help visualise word order increase success produce speech . By study specific component speech—inner speech—in relatively homogeneous population chronic expressive aphasic , present study provide explicit , critical mean understanding neurophysiological ( assessed functional magnetic resonance imaging ) neuropsychological ( assessed language battery personal questionnaires/interviews ) change occur speech therapy . As secondary objective , study explore effectiveness , feasibility adherence at-home computerised aphasia software deliver via portable tablet .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computerised Therapy Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>15 million people worldwide stroke year , 152,000 United Kingdom . Recent estimate suggest roughly 33 % patient suffer stroke develop aphasia , loss impairment language function cause brain damage , significant impact aspects individual 's life , well carers . Aphasia often long-term , chronic , affect patient least year initial stroke . Few study systematically investigated effect rehabilitation brain mechanism recruit support recovery stroke . Studies area highly heterogeneous . The heterogeneity largely stem 'lesion-related language deficit-related difference patient study ' . Participants across sometimes within study conduct area vary regard type aphasia time-following-stroke . These study also boast difference include type dosage treatment , type scan task use evaluate desired effect treatment , type data analysis employ . Results study , unsurprisingly , indicate dissimilar neural outcome associate neuropsychological gain , increase right hemisphere ( contra-lateral ) involvement , , contrast , increase peri-lesional activation . There , therefore , consensus 'successful therapy ' ( , elicit kind language gain , either comprehension production ) impact language network brain . `` It well know individual aphasia differ greatly often varying language pattern associate lesion , even study participant carefully select deficit pattern seldom , ever , homogeneous '' . People aphasia , , differ markedly . Given predicament , become necessary systematically control part study , include limit image task analysis one component language system use powerful design , crossover two therapeutic condition . This study therefore aim use systematic methodology add information diminutive body literature concern chronic aphasia rehabilitation explore specific component language network , inner speech , potential influence speech production ( neurophysiologically neuropsychologically ) . A previous study show inner speech involve network area dissociable implicated speech production , leave inferior frontal gyrus , especially par opercularis supramarginal gyrus . Further , behavioural analysis show interesting interaction inner overt speech small chronic aphasic population , whereas chronic stroke patient show poor inner speech couple good overt speech , others show good inner speech couple poor overt speech . This finding implies unexplored relationship two network : conceivably , improvement speech production rehabilitation might facilitate intact inner speech network . There hundred aphasia therapy market today . In general , two type therapy exist : impairment-based communication-based . Impairment-based therapy specifically target increase ability component language system , name , reading , write sentence structure , comprise therapy market . Communication-based therapy informal , aim stimulate conversation mean . The utilised therapy aphasia include constraint-induced therapy , involve constrain participant use word gesture communication , thus hop free individual non-speech compensatory strategy ; melodic intonation therapy , base observation people aphasia good success rate sing word rather say word , use melody crucial component relearn speech ; various phonological cue naming therapy , use repetition , semantic phonological cueing base specific anomia ( name ) deficit . Aphasia therapy prevalent , unlike drug therapy , carry little risk . This mean , however , aphasia therapy market effective type aphasia deficit . The scientific community lack understand therapy several facet : understanding treatment produce language gain specific population ( i.e. , chronic vs. acute individual , fluent vs. non-fluent aphasia type ) ; language gain map onto change neurological function ; trajectory language gain time , neuropsychologically neurologically . Utilising at-home computerised aphasia rehabilitation program , study explore whether inner speech assist patient restore access speak language , therefore result improvement language production ( assessed neuropsychological examination ) instigate change functional network ( assessed functional magnetic resonance imaging ) . The computerised therapy chosen detail clinical output system , ability personalise individual , ability adapt difficulty level need user . A successful at-home therapy program may provide mean combat lack resource continue rehabilitation outside acute , hospital setting . As secondary outcome , study investigate success , feasibility adherence software collect qualitative patient feedback analyse software 's quantitative output , exercise completion number time attempt , total time use overall performance exercise .</detailed_description>
