	<brief_title>Weaning From Mechanical Ventilation : Spontaneous Breathing Trial Assessment Work Breathing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical ventilation among common intervention intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Over last two decade , numerous study investigate method improve outcome patient receive mechanical ventilation . Despite proliferation data , large , multi-national cohort study find clinical outcome duration ventilation ICU stay improve significantly between1998 2004 . It recommend wean consider early possible patient trajectory spontaneous breathing trial ( SBT ) attempt , SBT best diagnostic criterion determine extubation readiness . The decision ready extubate consider complex delayed fail extubations associate increase ventilator time increase mortality . It show dyspnea occurs among nearly half ventilator patient strongly associate anxiety delay extubation . Between 30-75 % ICU patient report anxiety dyspnea , impaired communication skill , sleep disturbance may predispose factor . The assessment work breathe clinical deterioration important sub-categories clinical judgment determine wean tolerance . There little evidence whether patient experience work breathe correlate physician nurse . Hence , suggest need evaluate interobserver agreement clinical assessment weaning . The main objective study examine extent agreement patient health care provider assessment work breathe association agreement demographic- disease-related factor .</detailed_description>
