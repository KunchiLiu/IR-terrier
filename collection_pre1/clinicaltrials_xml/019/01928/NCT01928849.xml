	<brief_summary>The objective study , test effectiveness Valproic Acid ( VPA ) prevention chronic neuropathic post-amputation pain , well define underlie inflammatory epigenetic mechanism lead development chronic pain . HYPOTHESES AND QUESTIONS Hypothesis 1 : The use oral valproic acid combination regional anesthesia surgical limb-injury patient decrease incidence chronic nerve injury post-amputation pain . Goal 1 : In blind , randomize placebo-controlled , multi-center clinical trial , investigator determine oral VPA add regional anesthesia standard perioperative management reduce incidence nerve injury post-amputation pain compare regional anesthesia alone . Hypothesis 2 : The transition acute chronic pain mediate via epigenetic mechanism ( differential DNA methylation ) gene involve nociception . Goal 2 : Investigators analyze DNA methylation pattern patient different type neuropathic post-amputation pain determine alter VPA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RESEARCH DESIGN This study prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial test efficacy valproic acid ( VPA ) reduce incidence chronic neuropathic post-amputation pain follow amputation , stump revision , surgery limb injury neurologic damage . Patients randomized `` Control arm '' trial , receive standard regional anesthesia catheter ( either peripheral nerve epidural catheter ) , anesthetic management placebo . Patients randomize `` Intervention arm '' trial receive standard regional anesthesia catheter ( either peripheral nerve epidural catheter ) , anesthetic management , valproic acid 250mg preoperatively , three time per day either 6 day post-operatively time discharge . METHODOLOGY The enrollment goal study ( site ) 224 patient . Subjects recruit surgical clinic anesthesia pre-operative clinic . Outcomes patient intervention arm compare manage current institutional standard care include regional anesthesia catheter infusion . The study team anticipate 10 % drop-out rate 3 month secondary death loss follow . Thus 202 evaluable patient ( 101 patient arm ) 3 month surgery include study . After screen enrollment , study medication ( VPA placebo ) administer . Research blood sample collect preoperatively , postoperatively ( completion study drug administration , Amputation Clinic follow-up expression analysis . All sample de-identified subsequently study laboratory core facility Duke . Study specific questionnaire administer hospital stay , 1 month ( via mail ) , 3 month ( clinic ) 6 month ( clinic possible ) . RANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT Randomization stratify site surgical etiology . At time enrollment , subject assign one three surgical category randomization assignment log : amputation , stump revision , surgery limb injury neurologic damage . Prior surgery , Investigational Drug Pharmacist dispense study medication liquid form container label `` study drug '' indication liquid content . The pharmacist person aware treatment allocation . At end trial , endpoint adjudication complete study subject , study data treatment allocation un-blinded . Initial drug administration perform prior induction anesthesia day surgery . Subsequent dos administer bedside ICU floor nurse depend patient location . Participants complete study drug administration unless withdraw consent either treat physician principal investigator believe would dangerous continue valproic acid . If subject withdraws administration VPA , continue current medical regimen without alteration . DATA ANALYSIS PLAN The primary endpoint incidence chronic pain 3-month evaluation point , chronic pain define average pain score 3 point great Self-Reported Leeds Assessment Neuropathic Symptoms Signs pain scale ( S-LANSS ) . Secondary endpoint include numeric score S-LANSS , Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) , Defense Veterans Pain Rating Scale ( DVPRS ) RASS change score baseline 3 month , well incidence neuropathic limb post-amputation pain 1 6 month surgery . Frequency percentage categorical variable endpoint report treatment arm assess time . Mean , standard deviation range mean scale form , well change mean scale baseline compute arm assess time . Two-sample chi-square test use assess treatment difference primary endpoint post-amputation pain ( neuropathic pain ) time . Logistic regression apply investigate effect treatment primary endpoint post-amputation pain adjust potential prognostic variable include baseline pain level , study site , type surgery diabetes , intervene therapy . Similar analysis carry study sub-groups site , surgery type , diabetic status . Two-sample t-tests used ass treatment difference change mean pain scale baseline . In addition , linear regression use assess effect treatment change mean scale baseline adjust covariants . P value less 0.05 consider indicate statistical significance . Intent-to-treat analysis perform . Sensitivity analyse also carry exclude patient drop 3 month post-surgery . If dropout rate large 10 % evidence miss mechanism MCAR ( Missing Completely At Random ) MAR ( miss random ) , multiple imputation conduct . Analysis clinical study data carry de-identified download REDCap . All data share Duke Center Human Genetics ( CHG ) fully strip 18 Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) identifier ( ID ) . Private health information study participant respect data analysis do blinded fashion , individual identifiable final analysis dataset . Each patient allocate study ID number sign consent form , thereafter refer number . Investigators secure password protect access REDCap order enter data . The dataset biorepository fully de-identified dataset complete lock . Research blood sample track store within exist Laboratory Inventory Management System . All specimen identify barcode identifiable except via cod table hold securely Duke University Medical Center ( DUMC ) , Durham Veterans Administration Medical Center ( VAMC ) Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ( WRNMMC ) respectively .</detailed_description>
