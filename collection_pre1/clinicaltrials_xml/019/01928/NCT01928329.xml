	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Examine Effect Subcutaneous Exenatide ( Bydureon® ) Glucose Control Patients With Type I Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-site randomized placebo control trial Bydureon patient type I diabetes ( T1D ) least 2 year duration may may still detectable level C-peptide mixed meal tolerance test ( MMTT ) . Bydureon recently approve long act form Exenatide . Because lack safety data Bydureon child , propose conduct trial adult ( &gt; 18 yrs. ) . Both subject study personnel blind treatment assignment . The randomization do , 1 ; 1 , coordinate site ( Yale ) . As secondary analysis , propose determine whether presence residual insulin production modifies drug effect . To , plan stratify patient randomization basis detectable C-peptide level . We therefore wait result C-peptide level enrollment MMTT prior randomization . The study investigator tell stratum patient randomize blind C-peptide result MMTT conclusion study . Note : The primary study completion date change 4/2016 reflect extension recruitment accrual period .</detailed_description>
