	<brief_summary>The main goal study see drug call telmisartan decrease fibrosis ( scar ) inflammation ( irritation ) people infect HIV well HIV medication . The study also do see effect telmisartan sign disease inflammation body , see whether people HIV take telmisartan safely without side effect make want stop drug . Telmisartan FDA-approved treat high blood pressure decrease chance heart attack stroke people age 55 year age high risk event .</brief_summary>
