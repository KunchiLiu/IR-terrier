	<brief_summary>Women ER negative breast cancer high risk cancer return breast whole partial breast radiation woman ER positive breast cancer . In small study Johns Hopkins , woman treat partial breast irradiation chemotherapy give time . This combined treatment safe woman ER negative breast cancer well woman ER positive cancer . We test big study whether give partial breast irradiation chemotherapy time ( new method ) side effect outcomes give partial breast irradiation chemotherapy different time ( old method ) . In study woman breast cancer remove need radiation breast randomize partial breast irradiation time chemotherapy partial breast radiation different time chemotherapy . Randomization like flip coin study 2 every 3 woman get new method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partial Irradiation Sequential vs. Concurrent Chemo Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast conserve therapy ( BCT ) define lumpectomy adjuvant whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) integral treatment early stage breast cancer ( ESBC ) . In patient , BCT provide equivalent survival mastectomy . Despite equivalent survival , many patient still choose mastectomy BCT light 5-7 week commitment require radiation therapy ( XRT ) . Partial breast irradiation , however , provide woman ESBC alternative option XRT . Worth note , PBI offer several advantage WBI include ; decrease duration XRT , reduce radiation dose delivery normal breast tissue surround organ . Several large trial advance adoption PBI treatment option woman ESBC . Results trial unfortunately differ regard patient outcome . Some trial report significant difference local failure rate ( LFR ) intraoperative radiation therapy , interstitial brachytherapy standard WBI follow lumpectomy ( Vaidya et al . Lancet 2010 ; Polgar et al . IJROBP 2004 ) . While others , demonstrate similar outcome PBI WBI apply select group patient . ( Khan et al . International Journal Radiation Oncology *Biology *Physics ( IJROBP ) 2012 ; Shaitelman et al . Cancer 2010 ; Stull et al . ASTRO 2012 ) . A grow body evidence suggest , fact subgroup patient PBI may appropriate . In particular , patient estrogen receptor ( ER ) negative tumor observe high LFR patient ER positive tumor . Stull et al . report 3-year LFR 2 % 12 % ER positive ( n=149 ) ER negative ( n=17 ) tumor , respectively ( Stull et al . ASO 2012 ) . Additionally , Shaitelman et al . review patient treat Mammosite registry find hazard ratio local failure 4.01 woman ER negative compare ER positive disease ( n=991 ) . ( Shaitelman et al . Cancer 2010 ) To address variation patient outcome woman treat PBI , American Society Radiation Oncology ( ASTRO ) publish consensus statement group patient `` suitable , '' `` cautionary , '' `` unsuitable '' category . These grouping seek identify population best suit PBI . Patients ER negative breast cancer assign either cautionary unsuitable category . Shah et al . publish pooled analysis ( n=1978 ) find significant factor associate ipsilateral breast recurrence ( IBRT ) woman receive PBI ER status . ( Shah et al . IJROBP 2012 ) . Leonardi et al . report similar finding ; local recurrence 2.68 ( p = 0.0003 ) likely ER negative ( n=189 ) ER positive ( n=1608 ) breast cancer ( Leonardi et al . IJROBP 2012 ) . These result suggest perhaps , patient ER negative disease appropriate patient treat PBI . In addition radiation therapy , patient often treat chemotherapy . Chemotherapy traditionally administer either PBI . There potentially significant benefit , however , gain simultaneous administration chemotherapy PBI . Administrations radiation concurrent chemotherapy soon surgery shorten overall duration therapy , potential capitalize synergy two treatment modality improve local control . Reports prohibitive toxicity concurrent administration anthracycline-based chemotherapy WBI make approach unpopular . The small field employ PBI may provide alternative option . PBI potential reduce toxicity accelerate radiation treatment schedule . To date , able conduct two phase I trials PBI concurrent chemotherapy ( PBICC ) . In trial test whether toxicity remain prohibitive combine treatment regimen . In first trial , 25 patient treat PBI concurrent dose dense doxorubicin cyclophosphamide . In second trial , 34 patient treat similarly selection chemotherapy regimen discretion treat medical oncologist . Results trial reveal PBICC well appear tolerate . Specifically , grade 3 4 acute late radiation induce toxicity either trial . Although trial power local failure , one significant find trial local failure first trial ( median follow 6 year ) , one failure ( low grade DCIS ) second trial ( median follow 2.5 year ) . Interestingly , recurrence 21 patient ER negative tumor 17 patient triple negative tumor . Our center center investigate published phase I trials PBICC . Through trial demonstrate preliminary information PBICC safe , feasible , effective treatment option woman ESBC . Based unique experience , hypothesize woman ER negative ESBC treat PBICC local control rate similar woman ER positive disease . Additionally , hypothesize woman place prone position even favorable toxicity profile woman place supine position PBI WBI . To substantiate low toxicity associate PBICC test improve local control hypothesis , conduct randomize prospective trial PBI concurrent vs. sequential chemotherapy woman ER negative ESBC . Our primary endpoint acute grade 3-4 radiation toxicity secondary endpoint local control breast specific quality life</detailed_description>
