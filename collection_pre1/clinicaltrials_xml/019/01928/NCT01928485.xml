	<brief_title>Green Tea Extract Treating Patients With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess change level total- free- prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , free total PSA ( f/tPSA ) ratio insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-I ) level IGF-I/free PSA ( fPSA ) ratio , insulin-like growth factor bind protein 3 ( IGFBP-3 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) Sunphenon 90DCF-T ( green tea extract ) supplementation period recruitment biopsy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect oral ingestion Sunphenon 90DCF-T supplementation period recruitment biopsy reactivation glutathione S-transferase pi 1 ( GSTP1 ) ( whole blood deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] ) ; level antigen identify monoclonal antibody Ki-67 ( Ki-67 ) , cluster differentiation 34 ( CD34 ) , M30 apopotosense prostate tissue . II . To evaluate effect oral ingestion Sunphenon 90DCF-T period recruitment biopsy histologic finding prostate tissue nuclear measurement viz . shape , size texture quality life ( QOL ) assessment . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients undergo active surveillance 52 week . ARM B : Patients receive green tea extract orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 52 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must males histologically confirm clinically localize lowgrade lowvolume prostate cancer demonstrate time initial diagnosis Prostate biopsy must positive cancer : clinically localize T1c T2a , PSA ≤ 10 , Gleason ≤ 6 time initial diagnosis . As intent serial biopsy ensure disease progress stage grade require treatment , presence negative biopsy follow initial positive biopsy ( couple clinically localize T1c T2a PSA ≤10 Gleason ≤6 patient treatment , render patient ineligible . If consecutive biopsy either negative , positive remain clinically localize T1c T2a , PSA≤10 Gleason ≤6 , patient eligible Willing refrain concurrent use highdose ( 200 mg high per day ) vitamin , antioxidant , Proscar , Advodart , antiinflammatory agent Willing sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve informed consent document adhere protocol Willing able take oral medication Willing refrain drinking kind tea ( include herbal tea ) use supplement contain green tea duration study Subjects must newly diagnose ( within 1 year ) , previously untreated prostate cancer without malignancy ; therefore , prior therapy permit Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) ≤ institutional upper limit normal Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [ SGPT ] ) ≤ institutional upper limit normal Serum creatinine within normal institutional limit Subject must willing limit alcohol moderate use define : one drink day woman two drink day men ; examples one drink include : Beer : 12 fluid ounce ( 355 milliliter ) Wine : 5 fluid ounce ( 148 milliliter ) Distilled spirit ( 80 proof ) : 1.5 fluid ounce ( 44 milliliter ) Patients receive investigational agent Patients know concurrent malignancy History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Sunphenon 90 DCFT agent use study Recent consumption tea ( six cup per day ) use supplement contain green tea within one week randomization ; concomitant use least 400 mg per day nonsteroidal antiinflammatory ( NSAID ) agent two time per week Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Patients receive prior hormonal surgical therapy prostate cancer ; include prior brachytherapy radiation therapy Signs symptom progressive uncontrolled liver disease Known malignancy site within last two year ; exception basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) Participation research trial within past three month Any condition would interfere ability give inform consent comply study protocol Hypersensitivity tea product inactive ingredient find drug product capsule Patients know history Gilbert 's syndrome</criteria>
