	<brief_summary>Background : Ventilator induce lung injury ( VILI ) remain problem neonatology . High frequency oscillatory ventilation ( HFOV ) provide effective gas exchange minimal pressure fluctuation around continuous distend pressure therefore small tidal volume . Animal study show recruitment maintenance functional residual capacity ( FRC ) HFOV ( `` open lung concept '' ) could reduce lung injury . `` Open lung HFOV '' achieve deliver moderate high mean airway pressure ( MAP ) use oxygenation guide lung recruitment . Some neonatologists suggest combine HFOV recurrent sigh-breaths ( HFOV-sigh ) deliver modified conventional ventilator-breaths rate 3/min . The clinical observation HFOV-sigh lead stable oxygenation , quicker wean short ventilation . This may relate improved lung recruitment . This however knowledge test clinical trial use modern ventilator . Purpose , aim : - To compare HFOV-sigh HFOV-only determine difference oxygenation express a/A-ratio and/or stability oxygenation express percentage time oxygen saturation outside reference range . - To provide information feasibility treatment effect HFOV-sigh assist planning large study . We hypothesize oxygenation good HFOV-sigh . Methods : Infants 24-36 week correct gestational age already HFOV eligible . Patients randomly assign HFOV-sigh ( 3 breaths/min ) follow HFOV-only vice versa 4 alternate 1-hours period ( 2-treatment , double crossover design , patient control ) . During HFOV-sigh set-pressure reduce keep MAP constant , otherwise HFOV remain pretrial setting . Outcome calculate normal clinical parameter include pulx-oximetry transcutaneous monitoring oxygen carbon-dioxide partial pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High frequency oscillatory ventilation ( HFOV ) use neonatal respiratory care three decade . HFOV provide effective gas exchange minimal pressure fluctuation around set mean airway pressure ( MAP ) function continuous distend pressure ( CDP ) , low tidal volume compare conventional ventilation ( CV ) . HFOV therefore think able reduce risk bronchopulmonary dysplasia ventilate preterm baby . However result randomize controlled trial compare HFOV conventional ventilation conflict meta-analyses show clear evidence HFOV safer effective conventional ventilation neither use initial strategy rescue strategy preterm baby respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) . Consequently absolute indication HFOV preterm baby neonatologists today use HFOV rescue mode conventional ventilation fail acute setting RDS well baby bronchopulmonary dysplasia . Maintaining adequate functional residual capacity ( FRC ) together fraction inspire oxygen FiO2 main determinant oxygenation . The large FRC , large volume available oxygen alveolus gas transport . Adequate oxygen saturation ( SAT ) blood room air improvement oxygen-saturation without change fraction inspire oxygen see indirect indicator normal normalized FRC , neonatologists use oxygenation indirect marker lung volume HFOV . The CDP set-MAP main determinant lung-aeration HFOV . A low MAP may cause non-homogenous aeration atelectasis lead atelectotrauma redirection airflow compliant alveolus lead localized hyperinflation . Accordingly , early animal study show recruitment maintenance FRC HFOV could reduce lung injury . Lung recruitment initially achieve superimposing conventional ventilation ( CV ) breaths top HFOV low MAP use today , either recurrent sustain inflation last 15-20 second every 20 minute , intermittent sigh breath ( 3-5 tidal breath pr minute ) deliver normal conventional breaths conventional ventilation normal rate combine HFOV . Today neonatologists perform so-called `` open lung '' concept adjust set-MAP use oxygenation indirect guide lung recruitment . Different approach use explained difficulty direct bedside monitor FRC . Some initiate HFOV MAP 2-3 cm H2O MAP need conventional ventilation subsequently adjust MAP fraction inspire O2 ( FiO2 ) &lt; 0.25-0.6 providing sign inflation lungs x-ray . Others go complex step-wise increase MAP till FiO2 reduce , gradually decrease MAP FiO2 need increase maintain predefined SAT continue ventilation MAP set 2 cm H2O point , thereby place ventilation compliant deflation limb pressure-volume relationship lung . During HFOV , MAP may adjust mention . Further increase MAP may increase FRC increased aeration consequently improve oxygenation . Although recent clinical trial suggest approach safe , could potentially lead generalized hyperinflation volutrauma addition interfere systemic venous return cardiac output especially combine direct monitoring lung volume currently available routine clinical care . Combining intermittent recruitment sigh breaths rate 3-5 breaths/minute HFOV could alternate way assist maintain normalize FRC MAP increase temporarily intermittently . This could theory lead quicker wean MAP , less oxygen exposure potentially reduce lung injury . A concern however could , intermittent sigh breath lead intermittent excessive pressure distal airway excessive tidal volume accordingly beneficial . Nevertheless approach combine HFOV sigh breath low rate seem encourage number neonatologist . It however knowledge yet test control human trial . A search PubMed reveal human animal trial compare HFOV combine intermittent recruitment sigh-breaths low rate . Also trials explore approach currently register www.clinicaltrials.gov . To knowledge far one human trial compare HFVO recruitment breath low rate register never publish ( Texas Infant Star Trial ) . Combining HFOV conventional breath report limited number study focus HFOV combine CV normal rate show possible benefit . Similar result report compare High frequency Jet Ventilation ( HFVJ ) combine CV normal rate HFVJ alone . Trial rationale : Combining intermittent recruitment sigh breath low rate HFOV could offer way assist maintain normalize FRC modest increase MAP alignment open lung concept . A concern however could , intermittent sigh breath lead intermittent increase pressure distal airway large tidal volume accordingly beneficial . Despite , approach combine HFOV sigh breath seem encouraged number neonatologist . It however , knowledge yet test control human trial . We therefore wish conduct control cross-over trial assess effect HFOV combine intermittent sigh breath oxygenation ventilate neonate use oxygenation indirect indicator lung recruitment . Objective hypothesis : The objective trial : • Compare HFOV combine intermittent recruitment sigh breath rate 3/min ( HFOV-sigh ) HFOV ( HFOV-only ) examine : - oxygenation express a/A-ratio improves HFOV-sigh - a/A-ratio measure oxygenation calculate - a/A-ratio = paO2/ ( 0,95*FiO2- PaCO2 ) , - paO2 PaCO2 measure arterial blood arterial access situ otherwise transcutaneous value ( see ) . - stability oxygenation improve HFOV-sigh • express calculation percentage deviation time spend outside reference range oxygen-saturation ( SAT ) give gestational age ( AUC - area-under-the-curve ) compare MAP FiO2 . - Evaluate possibility set large randomize controlled trial We hypothesize HFOV-sigh oxygenation improve well stability oxygenation less time spend outside reference range SAT unchanged low FiO2 Trial design : The trial plan 4-period 2-treatment , double crossover clinical trial patient control . Patients randomly assign receive HFOV-Sigh follow HFOV-only vice versa four alternate 1-hours period .</detailed_description>
