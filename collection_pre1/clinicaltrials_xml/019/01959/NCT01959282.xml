	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness JNJ-54781532 Patients With Moderately Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2b , multicenter , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance compare medication test whether medication real effect clinical study ) , parallel-group ( group participant treat time ) , dose-response study ( study evaluate response different dosage study medication ) oral tablet JNJ-54781532 adult participant moderately severely active UC . Approximately 220 participant randomize 1:1:1:1:1 ratio 1 5 treatment group Week 0 ( placebo ; JNJ-54781532 25 mg daily ; JNJ-54781532 75 mg daily ; JNJ-54781532 150 mg daily ; JNJ-54781532 75 mg twice daily ) receive randomize dosage study medication Week 8 assess clinical response Week 8 . Participants achieve clinical response Week 8 continue receive original randomize dosage study medication Week 32 . Participants achieve clinical response Week 8 treated follow : participant originally randomize placebo receive JNJ-54781532 150 mg daily Week 16 ; participant originally randomize JNJ-54781532 continue receive original randomize dosage JNJ-54781532 Week 16 . Participants clinical response Week 8 achieve partial Mayo score response ( decrease baseline partial Mayo score â‰¥3 point ) Week 16 discontinue study medication ; achieve partial Mayo score response Week 16 continue receive JNJ 54781532 Week 32 . Participants evaluate safety ( adverse event ) Week 36 ( ie , 4 week last dose study medication ) . The maximum study duration participant approximately 44 week ( include maximum screening period ) .</detailed_description>
