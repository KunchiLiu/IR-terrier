	<brief_summary>Clostridium difficile become one leading cause hospital acquire infection , associate increased mortality . Patients C. difficile associate disease ( CDAD ) posse deficiency 'normal ' fecal microbial composition , likely result earlier antibiotic usage . The current standard care treatment severe C. difficile , consist antibiotic , restore microbiota . Restoration normal colonic microbiota fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) may enable reversion colonic microbial population 'normal'state lead cure . A patient develop severe CDAD may complicate adynamic ileus , toxic megacolon . The management context base limited data , available option sub-total colectomy . Although FMT mean new therapeutic modality , limited information use treatment acute CDAD , include severe CDAD . Because high morbidity mortality associate treatment patient severe CDAD , evidence support current recommendation weak base upon demonstration FMT effective strategy re-establish balance intestinal microbiota resultant cure recurrent CDAD , propose study efficacy safety FMT severe CDAD . Patients severe CDAD divide two operational group ; diarrhea suffer adynamic ileus . We propose apply FMT colonoscopy patient current data suggest overall success rate FMT recurrent CDAD low gastrointestinal tract FMT high FMT upper gastrointestinal tract . In addition , patient adynamic ileus toxic megacolon ( i.e. , population high CDAD-associated morbidity mortality ) , intra-colonic FMT administration prefer alternative .</brief_summary>
