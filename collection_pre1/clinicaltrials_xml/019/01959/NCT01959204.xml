	<brief_title>Evaluate The Pharmacokinetics Safety Of Oxycodone Oral Solution In Pediatric Adolescent Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase IV study characterize pharmacokinetics evaluate safety Oxycodone Oral Solution administer pediatric adolescent subject postoperative pain . It open label , multicenter study conduct 10 site . Subjects enrol preoperatively 14 day surgery expectation require intravenous ( IV ) access surgery least 24 hour postoperative analgesia opiate level medication . After dose Oxycodone Oral Solution ( 0.1 mg/kg child age 2 6 , 0.08 mg/kg age 7 12 , 0.07 mg/kg age 13 17 , dose determine base pharmacokinetic ( PK ) model interim analysis subject age 2 ) , subject carefully monitor safety . A total 110 pediatric adolescent male female subject enrol , include minimum 20 subject age 2 ( 5 subject age 0 &lt; 2 month , 5 subject age 2 &lt; 6 month , 10 subject age 6 month &lt; 2 year ) , 30 age 2 6 year , 30 age 7 12 year 30 age 13 &lt; 17 year . Subjects within age group evenly distribute age gender . An interim analysis run 10 subject age 2 6 year , 10 age 7 12 year 10 age 13 &lt; 17 year complete study . The interim analysis include PK , pulse oximetry reading , vital sign measurement , adverse event ( AEs ) concomitant medication . The dose Oxycodone Oral Solution subject age 6 month &lt; 2 year receive base PK model interim analysis . An additional interim analysis run least half subject age 6 month &lt; 2 year complete study . The interim analysis include PK , pulse oximetry reading , vital sign measurement , AEs concomitant medication . The dose Oxycodone Oral Solution subject age 0 &lt; 2 month 2 month &lt; 6 month receive base PK model interim analysis . The study consist Screening period within 14 day surgery ; predose check-in ( Day −1 ) ; treatment period surgery ( Day 1 , Time Zero ) ; End Study assessment . The total duration study , exclude Screening , approximately 1 full day . Eligible subject provide assent ( 7 &lt; 17 year old ) whose parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) provide consent require study assessment perform Screening . Following surgery , subject receive standard care , include parenteral analgesia nonoxycodone , nonoxymorphone medication interfere measurement metabolism oxycodone . At time ( Day −1 ) , predose check-in eligibility confirm . After subject ages 2 &lt; 17 postoperatively cleared transition oral pain medication , Oxycodone Oral Solution administer Time Zero Day 1 place standard analgesic medication . The first 10 subject 2 6 , 7 12 13 &lt; 17 age group , include first interim analysis , receive 1 dose Oxycodone Oral Solution . Subjects age group enrol study interim analysis complete may receive additional dos every 4-6 hour need . If pain control inadequate Oxycodone Oral Solution , investigator may administer IV dose ketorolac ( 0.5 mg/kg ) every 6 hour IV dose Morphine Sulfate ( 0.1 mg/kg ) every 4 hour rescue medication breakthrough pain dosing . Use rescue pain medication permissible accordance hospital pain management guideline facility standard care . Any rescue medication use provide study site pharmacy . After subject age 2 postoperatively cleared transition oral pain medication , receive single dose Oxycodone Oral Solution Time Zero Day 1 place standard analgesic medication . The dose determine base PK model interim analysis . If pain control inadequate Oxycodone Oral Solution , indicate score moderate severe ( 4-10 ) FLACC , subject give Fentanyl via Nurse-Controlled Analgesia ( NCA ) . The Fentanyl provide study site pharmacy . Subjects undergo End-of-Study assessment least 24 hour receive first dose Oxycodone Oral Solution . At time , study staff determines safe , subject discharge study . Safety assess monitor AEs , clinical laboratory test result , vital sign measurement , temperature , pulse oximetry , physical examination finding . The Faces , Legs , Activity , Crying , Consolability Scale ( FLACC ) use measure pain prior 20 , 40 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 minute dose Oxycodone Oral Solution subject age 2 . The FLACC also administer prior subject receive dose Fentanyl . Serial blood sample PK analysis collect determination plasma concentration oxycodone metabolite ( noroxycodone , oxymorphone noroxymorphone ) prior first dose ( within 15 minute dose ) ; 5 , 15 , 30 , 60 minute dose ; 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 hour dose . For subject age 2 , serial blood sample PK analysis collect prior first dose ( within 15 minute dose ) ; 15 , 30 , 60 minute dose ; 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 hour dose .</detailed_description>
