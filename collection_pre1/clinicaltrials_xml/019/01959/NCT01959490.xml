	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well trastuzumab pertuzumab bevacizumab combination chemotherapy work treat patient stage II-III breast cancer . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , pertuzumab , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , carboplatin , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving trastuzumab pertuzumab commercially market formulation bevacizumab without modification combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Pertuzumab Bevacizumab With Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage II-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine genomically derive 'molecular subtypes ' predict pathological complete response combination chemotherapy target therapy HER2 early stage breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore ability trastuzumab pertuzumab response signatures predict pCR HER2 positive tumor treat brief exposure trastuzumab pertuzumab follow combination chemotherapy . II . To explore value immune signatures well AKT IGF signatures predict pCR HER2 tumor treat brief exposure trastuzumab pertuzumab . III . To explore comprehensive annotation genomic alteration ( mutation , copy number alternation , gene fusion , non-coding RNA splice variant ) sub-stratify subtype-based classifier prediction response target therapy early stage breast cancer IV . To explore circulate RNA expression level associate treatment response V. To explore change cardiac function identify early cardiac injury use strain echocardiograms cardiac biomarkers treatment VI . To explore immunohistochemisitry-based marker response treatment Objectives Imaging Sub-Study : Secondary Objectives I . Evaluate visualization primary breast tumor use analog digital PET FDG FLT . II . Evaluate quantification FDG-uptake primary breast tumor use analog digital PET FDG FLT . III . Compare level change metabolic tumor activity analog digital FDG-PET/CT FLT-PET/CT clinical follow procures include CASE 14112 ( DCE-MRI , genetic testing , etc . ) OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment cohort base HER2 status . COHORT I ( HER2 positive ) : Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute , pertuzumab IV 30-60 minute , docetaxel IV , carboplatin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . As part standard care , patient receive three MRIs pre-treatment , biopsy take , surgery . Ten additional patient add cohort 1 take part image sub-study . These ten patient follow procedure participant cohort I PET/CT place DCE-MRI COHORT II ( HER2 negative ) : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 ; doxorubicin IV cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ; paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 week 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 . Prior receive paclitaxel patient receive anti-nausea medication After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
