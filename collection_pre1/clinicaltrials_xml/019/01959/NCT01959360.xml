	<brief_summary>The aim present study explore efficient surgical approach total hip replacement short long term concern strength , functionality postoperative complication . The objective register muscular strength , hip joint functionality/mobilisation complication total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) perform two minimal invasive/incision surgery ( MIS ) versus traditionally lateral approach . The primary working hypothesis due minimal dissection reduce trauma muscle , patient tolerate early hospital discharge well MIS traditional lateral surgery . Patients MIS group also active maintain muscular strength hip joint functionality/mobilisation well patient lateral group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With total hip replacement surgery , orthopaedic surgeon 's aim pain relief patient , also restoration hip joint biomechanics result minimal functional deficit maximal longevity implant . It exceptional patient still experience mild moderate long-term impairment postoperatively . These impairment include pain , muscle weakness hip abductor , contracture hip , gait disorder , well weakness hip extensor flexor . These problem may turn lead complication joint instability loosening implant . When lateral surgical approach use , major concern total hip replacement surgery muscle abductor weakness/atrophy , tendon defect gluteus minimus muscle , unsuccessful reattachment denervation anterior gluteal flap . Minimal incision/invasive surgery ( MIS ) define surgical approach perform short skin muscle incision avoid injury muscle tendon . Following minimally invasive approach reduce muscle trauma find . Moreover clinical outcome improve , gluteus medius muscle spar successfully . However , debate whether overall result MIS superior , even good traditional hip replacement surgery term component place time revision prosthesis .</detailed_description>
