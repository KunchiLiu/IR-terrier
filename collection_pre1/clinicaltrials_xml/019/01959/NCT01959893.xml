	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia Syndrome ( FMS ) highly prevalent condition , often affect individual prime life , cause severe reduction quality life productivity , well social isolation , anxiety depression . FMS condition characterize chronic widespread pain , consider manifestation central nervous system sensitization , lead increase processing transmission pain . At time however , become gradually evident , FMS merely pain syndrome . Those patient suffer full-blown clinical syndrome FMS inevitably describe many additional symptom beside pain . While symptom , heighten sensitivity external stimulation ( e.g . noise light ) , easily understood represent aspect basic underlying propensity towards central sensitization , symptom easily explain context .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While cognitive impairment long recognize part fibromyalgia syndrome , extensively review Glass , early research pathophysiology clinical manifestation aspect relatively limited , particularly field image . Nonetheless , physicians deal FMS patient well aware fact , real-life situation , cognitive impairment often devastate functional status patient pain . Not infrequently , patient may relate grown accustomed pain know manage , find impossible continue work study severe difficulty memory concentration . Research show call `` fibro-fog '' , popular term refer FMS - related dyscognition , rank patient one important complaint . Memory impairment appear constitute important aspect dysfunction typical FMS . Characteristic disturbance demonstrate FMS various memory type , include semantic memory - ability recollect facts general information episodic memory - ability recall past event . Attention disturbance demonstrate FMS well , work memory - ability temporarily hold process information mind , Distraction target Selective attention . The pathophysiology cognitive impairment FMS remain incompletely understood . Various modulators suggest , include sleep disturbance , mood disorder , medication salient symptom FMS - chronic pain . While cognitive impairment remain control anxiety depression sleep disturbance , level pain consistently correlate severity cognitive dysfunction FMS . Notably , despite clinical significance cognitive impairment FMS , despite - mention evidence regard various aspect memory impairment condition , neuroscience underpinnings deficit clearly elucidate ; Moreover , neuroimaging study demonstrate interaction pain cognitive area strikingly ; One study recently demonstrate altered activation fronto-parietal network FMS patient , perform N-back task - frequently use work memory task . While new American College Rheumatology criterion diagnosis FMS incorporate cognitive impairment diagnostic scheme , well establish scale symptom severity , interplay cognitive impairment symptom clearly understood . Thus , clear data regard degree cognitive impairment correlate symptom pain , fatigue , abdominal discomfort etc individual patient extent longitudinal relationship maintain parameter ( i.e . extent improvement worsen one symptom correlate others ) . From practical , clinical view point , assess degree cognitive impairment FMS extremely difficult currently usually leave ( best ) subjective report patient . This difficulty compound fact cognition one broad array symptom realm FMS fact clinician deal FMS patient , e.g . rheumatologist , regularly involved implementation cognitive assessment . Thus , clear need obtain reliable reproducible tool assessment cognitive impairment FMS . Such tool could utilize objective biomarker evaluation clinical course response treatment well tool evaluate interplay cognitive impairment domain fibromyalgia syndrome . The purpose propose study utilize validate fully computerize cognitive assessment battery ( Mindstreams ; NeuroTrax Corp. ) assess correlation cognitive impairment clinical , self-reported , severity parameter fibromyalgia syndrome . We aim explore relationship , , report subjective parameter , level pain , stress , depression extent adopt 'sick-role ' patient FMS , indices cognitive impairment . We hypothesize severity subjective stress , rather medical/clinical parameter syndrome , correlate positively cognitive impairment .</detailed_description>
