	<brief_summary>In vitro study demonstrate sodium selenite sufficient concentration sufficient time high tumoricidal capacity . This find many human cell type leukemia cell , mesothelioma non-small cell lung cancer cell . A minority cell line seem resistant . The question clinical point view : Is possible respect toxicity administer sodium selenite patient sufficient dose sufficient time get response patient cancer ? We perform first part phase-1 study find MTD 10.2 mg/m2 give 10 daily infusion 12 day . We record limited anti-tumor effect treatment regimen . However , vitro data suggest low concentration continuous exposure 51 h much effective . Now plan continue phase-I trial modify protocol . More specific : 1 . Phase I : Find maximal tolerable dose continuous infusion 2 . Phase II : Use MTD study response ,</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Patients : With advanced malignant disease , kind , standard treatment try , still progression . In sufficient good performance status ( p 0-2 ) get treatment : first selenite immediately afterwards chemotherapy ( since additive synergistic effect selenite chemotherapy find ) . - Treatment : We perform initial study sodium selenite i.v . daily , 10 treatment 2 week . The week response evaluation chemotherapy . In patient , first line chemotherapy treatment give , since vitro study indicate selenite might reverse resistance . In modified protocol , 2 day continuous infusion perform . - Toxicity evaluation ( main criterion phase I ) : Meeting doctor week selenite treatment chemotherapy treatment End treatment . Meeting nurse treatment day selenite treatment . Blood sample liver , kidney , blood thyroid value . Plasma sample selenite concentration treatment . - Response evaluation ( : main criterion phase II study also phase I ) : CT scan selenite treatment chemotherapy . From May 2011 FDG-PET-CT-scan selenite treatment . Cytokeratin cytokeratin fragment evaluation .</detailed_description>
