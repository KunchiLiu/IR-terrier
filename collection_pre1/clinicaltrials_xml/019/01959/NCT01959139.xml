	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase ( PEGPH20 ) give together combination chemotherapy see well work compare combination chemotherapy alone treat patient newly diagnose pancreatic cancer spread place body . Pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase may help chemotherapy drug work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective without pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase treat pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety modify leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride oxaliplatin ( mFOLFIRINOX ) combination PEGPH20 select optimal dose PEGPH20 phase II portion patient metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . ( Phase I ) II . To assess overall survival patient metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treat mFOLFIRINOX + PEGPH20 compare treat mFOLFIRINOX alone . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) patient receive mFOLFIRINOX PEGPH20 patient receive mFOLFIRINOX alone patient population . II . To assess objective tumor response ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) patient measurable disease treat mFOLFIRINOX PEGPH20 patient receive mFOLFIRINOX alone patient population . III . To determine frequency , severity , tolerability adverse event mFOLFIRINOX PEGPH20 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore correlation maximum decrease cancer antigen ( CA ) 19-9 level time maximum decrease CA 19-9 level overall survival , progression-free survival response . II . To explore correlation plasma hyaluronan ( HA ) tumor expression HA overall survival , progression-free survival response . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose de-escalation study pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase follow randomized phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute day 1* ; oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 1.5 hour day 2 ; fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 2-4 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 1.5 hour day 2 , fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 2-4 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase IV 10 minute day 1* oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , irinotecan hydrochloride , fluorouracil Arm I . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . *NOTE : Some patient also receive pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase day 3 4 course 1 2 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
