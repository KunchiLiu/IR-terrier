	<brief_summary>The overarch goal randomize trial estimate effect combine midurethral sling ( MUS ) peri-operative behavioral/pelvic floor therapy ( BPTx ) compare MUS alone successful treatment MUI symptoms 472 woman . Secondary objective include estimate effect combine treatment compare MUS improve overactive bladder ( OAB ) stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) outcomes separately , need additional treatment , time failure identify predictor poor outcome MUI population . A supplemental study , The Human Microbiome Study ESTEEM , evaluate urinary vaginal microbiome relates woman MUI , treatment unaffected control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Treatment Mixed Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ESTEEM multi-center randomize trial 472 woman MUI elect undergo surgical treatment SUI . Participants randomize peri-operative BPTx program+MUS versus MUS alone . The purpose compare combine MUS+BPTx versus MUS alone ( control ) improve MUI symptom 1 year . Patients assign one two treatment group . Randomization stratify clinical site UUI `` severity , '' define number urgency urinary IEs diary . The primary outcome study mean change baseline UDI-total score 1 year postoperative . The UDI validate , disease-specific , patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) measure . Secondary outcome UUI/OAB outcomes measure use UDI-irritative subscale measure symptom burden , impact , change relate OAB . It highly responsive treatment-related change able discriminate among level change bladder diary variable ( urinary urgency , frequency urge incontinence ) patient rating treatment benefit characterize MUS may affect OAB symptom individually whole . SUI symptom outcome measure use UDI-stress subscale compare SUI outcomes woman randomize MUS + BPTx versus MUS alone . Other UUI/OAB outcome compare group include 1 ) change IE frequency type , number urgency episode , urgency severity void , number diurnal void , number nocturnal void use bladder diary ; 2 ) patient satisfaction treatment use OAB-SAT-q ; 3 ) bother heal relate quality life use OAB-q subscale For analyze time failure , `` failure '' define initiation additional treatment either SUI UUI/OAB symptoms follow-up period . Subjects lose follow censor time last visit . Quality life/global impression assess compare treatment group use ) Incontinence Impact Questionnaire ( IIQ ) , Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire ( PISQ ) , c ) European Quality Life-5 Dimensions ( EQ-5D ) , ) Adaptation Index e ) Patient Global Impression Improvement ( PGI-I ) Patient Global Impression Severity ( PGI-S ) . Safety/additional treatment characterize ) additional re-treatments SUI UUI within 12 month treatment , type re-treatment b ) return OR sling revision due worsen OAB symptom . To evaluate association PFM strength improvement UI symptom , objectively assess PFM strength change use Peritron Perineometer , instrument specifically design pelvic floor assessment .</detailed_description>
