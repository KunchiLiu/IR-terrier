	<brief_summary>Medication adherence rate among youth live HIV inadequate effectively manage disease , novel intervention ground basic behavioral science need . This multi-site phase ( 3 phase ) study plan translate basic cognitive neuroscience regard prospective memory ( PM ) potent adherence intervention youth live HIV ( YLH ) . The phase : Phase 1 : To improve PM basic laboratory task YLH substance abuse . - Hypothesis 1 : Manipulations three theory-based component PM ( strategic encoding , self-monitoring cue salience ) improve PM within participant . Phase 2 : To conduct proof concept study text-delivered PM intervention take ART YLH suboptimal adherence . - Hypothesis 2 : Using multiple baseline across subject design , adherence ART improve follow initiation PM adherence intervention maintain 6 week taper intervention . - Hypothesis 2a : Similar feasibility , tolerability , adherence improvement trend see youth without substance problem . Phase 3 : To conduct pilot randomize clinical trial PM intervention compare traditional text message reminder ( comparison condition ) non-adherent youth stratify substance use . - Hypothesis 3 : Youth randomize receive PM intervention show great initial sustain improvement adherence viral load compare randomize control condition . - Hypothesis 3a : We explore trend data relative substance abuse , anticipate intervention show promise substance use non substance use YLH warrant large clinical trial test substance-related mediator moderator intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Medication adherence rate among youth live HIV inadequate effectively manage disease , novel intervention ground basic behavioral science need . Emerging evidence suggest prospective memory ( PM ) could represent important piece puzzle . PM define neurocognitive capacity successfully form , maintain , execute intention particular point future response specific cue . This study plan translate basic cognitive neuroscience regard PM potent adherence intervention YLH , population high risk poor cognitive function , substance abuse , poor adherence . While text message reminder increasingly popular adherence support , evidence efficacy equivocal particularly maintenance adherence reminder end . By use basic cognitive neuroscience enhance potency technology-based intervention improve PM adherence task , hope achieve great initial gain well sustain improvement adherence youth without substance abuse This multi-site phase study plan translate basic cognitive neuroscience regard PM potent adherence intervention youth live HIV ( YLH ) . - In Phase 1 , conduct theory-driven laboratory study improve three component PM use within-subjects design traditional cognitive neuroscience task ( strategic encoding , monitoring , cue salience ) 60 youth clinic co-PIs base ( Detroit San Diego ) . - In Phase 2 , translate promising Phase 1 PM intervention youth 's natural context target adherence combine text messaging , test signal efficacy use multiple baseline design YLH suboptimal adherence ( N=24 ; 12 substance abuse 12 without Detroit ) . - In Phase 3 , conduct pilot randomize clinical trial compare technology-based PM adherence intervention text message reminder ( N=60 Detroit San Diego ) .</detailed_description>
