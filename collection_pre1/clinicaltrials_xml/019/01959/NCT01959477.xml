	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study personalize dose monitoring busulfan combination chemotherapy treat patient Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma undergo stem cell transplant . Giving chemotherapy stem cell transplant stop growth cancer cell stop divide kill . After treatment , stem cell collect patient 's peripheral blood bone marrow store . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy . Monitoring dose busulfan may help doctor deliver accurate dose reduce toxicity patient undergoing stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Monitoring Busulfan Combination Chemotherapy Hodgkin Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility real-time therapeutic dose monitoring ( TDM ) daily intravenously ( IV ) busulfan administration part preparative regimen patient lymphoma undergo autologous stem cell transplantation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare incidence adverse event include mucositis , liver toxicity , seizure , pulmonary toxicity TDM daily IV busulfan compare historic control . II . To compare 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) , TDM daily IV busulfan compare historic control . III . To determine proportion patient would achieve desired busulfan level weight-based busulfan dose therefore require TDM . OUTLINE : Patients receive busulfan intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour day -9 -6 , etoposide IV continuously 24-36 hour day -5 -4 , cyclophosphamide IV 4 hour day -3 -2 . Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplant day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
