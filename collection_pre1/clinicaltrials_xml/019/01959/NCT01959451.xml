	<brief_summary>This study investigate whether platelet function test guide approach short-term ( 1 week ) prasugrel treatment switch clopidogrel treatment adequate responder clopidogrel non-inferior regarding combine incidence bleed thrombotic complication 12 month standard treatment prasugrel acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) patient treat percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing Responsiveness Platelet Inhibition Chronic Antiplatelet Treatment For Acute Coronary Syndromes Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffer heart attack highly activate blood platelet . During invasive treatment block coronary vessel ( percutaneous coronary intervention = PCI ) potent platelet inhibition need reduce risk thrombotic complication particularly high within first week PCI . On hand , use potent platelet inhibitor prasugrel associate higher bleed risk particularly use long-term . A combination potent antiplatelet drug ( prasugrel ) within first week less potent antiplatelet drug ( clopidogrel ) thereafter might lead high net clinical benefit - mean less bleed thrombotic complication . This hypothesis investigate current trial .</detailed_description>
