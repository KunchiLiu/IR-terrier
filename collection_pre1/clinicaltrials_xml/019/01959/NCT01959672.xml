	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well combination chemotherapy without oregovomab follow stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) nelfinavir mesylate work treat patient pancreatic cancer spread nearby organ tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , oregovomab , block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Stereotactic body radiation therapy specialize radiation therapy send x-ray directly tumor use small dos several day may cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs , nelfinavir mesylate , may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving combination chemotherapy without oregovomab follow SBRT nelfinavir mesylate may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Oregovomab Followed Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Nelfinavir Mesylate Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy neoadjuvant chemotherapy , ( gemcitabine [ gemcitabine hydrochloride ] , leucovorin [ leucovorin calcium ] , fluorouracil [ 5-FU ] ) without oregovomab , follow hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) concurrently nelfinavir ( nelfinavir mesylate ) patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer cancer antigen ( CA ) 125 positive ( &gt; = 10 ) CA125 negative ( &lt; 10 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety neoadjuvant chemotherapy , ( gemcitabine , leucovorin , 5-FU ) without oregovomab , follow SRT concurrently nelfinavir patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer CA125 positive ( &gt; = 10 ) CA125 negative ( &lt; 10 ) . II . To assess cellular humoral immune response active immunotherapy oregovomab/monoclonal antibody patient pancreas cancer CA125 level great 10 undergoing chemotherapy radiation treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tumor organ motion 4-dimensional ( 4D ) compute tomography ( CT ) respiratory gate system . II . To evaluate effect tumor/organ motion dosimetry , local control survival . III . To evaluate inter- intra-fractional target motion Calypso system . OUTLINE : CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) , leucovorin calcium IV 30 minute , fluorouracil IV 24 hour day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 7 course . IMMUNOTHERAPY : Patients CA125 level &gt; = 10 receive oregovomab IV 15-30 minute day 15 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 3 course ( week 1 , 4 , 7 ) post- radiation therapy 1 course ( week 14 ) . Patients may receive additional 3 course concurrently chemotherapy upon recovery surgery base CA125 level . Patients also receive nelfinavir mesylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 5 week begin day 15 week 9 . STEREOTACTIC RADIATION THERAPY : Beginning week 11 , patient undergo SBRT 5 fraction 5 consecutive day . Upon completion radiation therapy , patient resume nelfinavir mesylate 14 day ( week 12-13 ) . Patients without metastasis resectable disease undergo surgery week 17-18 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
