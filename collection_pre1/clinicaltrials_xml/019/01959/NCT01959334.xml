	<brief_summary>In recent past year , regulatory agency FDA EMA outline recommended adoption risk-based approach evaluate mitigate immune response therapeutic protein may adversely affect safety efficacy . In recommendation , transient persistent antibody response combine determine overall immunogenicity product give condition . In particular , persistent antibody high importance , since patient persistent antibody likely experience clinical sequela term safety efficacy , transient antibody response resolve without consequence . The present study provide information immunogenicity AMG504-1 regard potential development high antibody titer neutralize antibody activity may lead loss efficacy increase risk adverse reaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Immunogenicity Novel Glucagon Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AMG105 single center , randomize , single dose , laboratory-blinded , parallel design study . The main objective study evaluate immunogenicity repeat single dos glucagon follow intranasal ( IN ) intramuscular ( IM ) administration adult Type 1 Type 2 diabetes ( T1D T2D ) . The secondary objective evaluate safety tolerability glucagon follow IN IM administration adult T1D T2D . A total seventy-five ( 75 ) adult patient T1D T2D include study . Male female patient least 18 year age old 70 year history type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes least 2 year duration , body mass index ( BMI ) great equal 18.5 equal 35 kg/m2 select accord inclusion exclusion criterion . They general good health , without late severe complication , accord medical history , physical examination ( include vital sign ) , nasal examination , bilateral anterior rhinoscopy laboratory test ( biochemistry , hematology , urinalysis ) include negative screening ethanol drug abuse urine . A 12-lead ECG perform . For female patient , HCG beta serum pregnancy test must negative . A single dose glucagon administer morning 10-hour overnight fast , either intranasal intramuscular route , 3 occasion . The random allocation treatment subject generate use 2:1 stratification . Safety tolerability evaluate assessment adverse event , clinical laboratory examination . Descriptive statistic comprise sample size , mean , median , SD 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) mean use describe titer anti-glucagon antibody treatment group period . In addition , number , proportion associate 95 % CI patient treatment group anti-glucagon antibody limit detection describe .</detailed_description>
