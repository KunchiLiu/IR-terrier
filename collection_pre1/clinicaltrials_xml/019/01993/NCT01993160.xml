	<brief_title>18F-FCH ( Fluorocholine ) -PET/MR Staging High-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 60 % patient treated radical prostatectomy external beam radiotherapy prostate cancer biochemical failure 5 year . This may due several reason , include presence sub-clinical metastasis time local therapy . Currently , patient high risk prostate cancer stag MRI prostate ( assess local extent disease ) , CT abdomen ( detect spread lymph node ) bone scan ( assess spread bone ) . However , standard image exams always identify site disease . Recent research suggest perform positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan tracer call fluorocholine ( FCH ) improve identification lymph node bone metastases prostate cancer , result accurate diagnosis . The main goal study find whether stag high risk prostate cancer patient FCH PET-CT MRI whole body improve detection primary tumor metastasis compare current standard imaging exam . Improved staging patient prostate cancer may impact patient care help select appropriate therapy . In study , participant undergo either combined PET/MRI PET-CT MRI standard evaluation . The accuracy stag approach ( standard vs. PET MRI ) evaluate . In addition , incorporate novel method data interpretation create image map combine data PET MRI ( term `` Multiparametric map '' ) . The goal novel approach find whether map 2 characteristic tumor time improve tumor detection accuracy diagnosis . About 40 men Princess Margaret Hospital take part study . The study take 2 year complete enrollment result know within 36 month completion enrollment .</detailed_description>
