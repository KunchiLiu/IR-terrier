	<detailed_description>NeuroFeedback describe form Biofeedback base recording brain act ivity reflect image technique real-time fMRI ( Johnston al , 2010 ) mainly use scalp EEG recording ( Angelakis et al. , 2007 ) . This method base classical operant learn paradigm apply last 40 year therapeutic method range clinical condition epilepsy , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder locked-in syndrome ( Kübler et al. , 2009 ; Vernon , Frick , &amp; Gruzelier , 2004 ) , optimise performance healthy subject ( Egner &amp; Gruzelier , 2003 ) . Participants experience real time brain activity form animate visual auditory stimulus ( feedback ) co-vary specific property record activity . By reinforced obtain goal , participant learn volitionally modulate brain activity . The feedback continuously represent brain activity minimum delay , modern equipment order ten millisecond . sLORETA widespread linear , discrete , instantaneous , full-volume inverse solution proximity brain electromagnetic measurement ( Pascual-Marqui , Esslen , Kochi , &amp; Lehmann , 2002 ; Pascual-Marqui , 2002 ) . Whereas EEG measure electric potential variation two dimensional surface , sLORETA estimate current density three dimensional space result potential divergence scalp . EEG Tomography direct bio-feedback correlate physiological signal continuous feedback signal ; however , physiological signal deﬁned current density speciﬁed region interest ( ROI ) calculate mean sLORETA algorithm . This allow continuous feedback signal become function intracranial current density co-vary . In first LORETA neuro-feedback study design assess possibility use protocol healthy subject , Condego ( 2004 ) et al record current density subject ' anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) feedback subject size disk present computer screen . Larger size disk represent high current density record subject 's ACC . The subject instruct make circle size large , therefore reinforce high ACC activity . The result study support effect LORETA neuro-feedback protocol subject 's performance sustain attention task . This support 'LORETA neurofeedback ' effect cognitive performance yet still direct evidence effect LORETA neurofeedback excitability neural tissue . One direct evidence achieve single pulse TMS measure motor cortex plasticity . Ros et al ( 2010 ) demonstrate effect unipolar neurofeedback protocol exitability motor cortex . In study , record electrode position C3 ( 10-20 system ) motor cortex subject participate neurofeedback protocol . Motor cortex plasticity measure hemisphere train . The result indicate high plasticity train electrode compare train compare homologue location opposite hemisphere . Study goal In study investigate specific effect M1 training use sLORETA neurofeedback excitability motor cortex hemispheres training , compare effect superior parietal gyrus ( SPG ) training . Design A double blind active control , mixed design . The differential protocol effect investigate application . Furthermore , Comparison hold train hemisphere untrained hemisphere . Statistical analysis Depicted figure 1 , design analyze 2×2×2 , target train ( M1 , SPG ) one subject factor , side motor excitability assessment ( Left / Right ) before/after NBF training two within subject factor . ANOVA calculate triple interaction effect . Method Protocol Participants randomly assign either rM1 ( right primary motor cortex ) active treatment group rSPG ( right superior parietal gyrus ) active treatment group ( see figure 1 ) . The experimenter program train protocol every subject separately . The neurofeedback therapist select protocol associate subject number . Therefore participant therapist blind experimental condition . Before first session , underlie principle EEG bio-feedback explain participant kindly ask sign inform consent version find ethic committee application form . All recording session carry comfortably dim light , sound attenuate room Beer-Sheva Psychiatric Center . Lighting temperature hold constant duration experiment . Participants invite lab one session completion research protocol . The timeline session depict figure 2 . Initially , neurofeedback training ( T0 ) subject complete MRT task ( Shepard &amp; Metzler , 1971 ) thereafter , test hemisphere motor cortex excitability ( MEP ) use single pulse TMS paradigm ( describe ) . After MEP , three-minute eyes-opened three-minute eyes-closed EEG baseline record . Following , subject participate sLORETA-neurofeedback protocol ( describe ) . Immediately ( T1 ) neurofeedback session , repeat assessment conduct T0 accord reversed timeline . Electrophysiology data acquisition EEG recording take place initiation end research protocol . We place 19 electrode EEG hat participants sculpt attach EEG amplifier . All equipment material use approved clinical research use routinely use hospital variable treatment protocols therefore consider safe . Participants prepare EEG record use measure distance nasion inion determine appropriate cap size recording ( Electrocap , Inc ; Blom &amp; Anneveldt , 1982 ) . The head measure marked prior session maintain consistency . The ear forehead clean record mild abrasive gel remove oil dirt skin . After ﬁtting cap , electrode site inject electrogel prepared impedance individual electrode ear less 5KΩ . Training conduct use 19-leads standard international 10/20 system . Preparation process take 20 minute cause distress participant . TMS , motor cortex plasticity assessment All measurement carry monophasic Magstim 2000 magnetic stimulator ( Magstim , Whitland , UK ) . We evaluate TMS parameter hemisphere , first right ( train ) leave ( untrained ) hemisphere , investigate hemispheric effect NFB . Resting motor threshold ( RMT ) intensity define low stimulator output intensity capable induce MEPs least 50 µV peak-to-peak amplitude FDI muscle least half 10 trial . Active motor threshold define intensity need evoke MEP 200 µV 5-10 % maximum voluntary contraction . CSE quantify amplitude MEP elicit single test TMS pulse . The test pulse intensity set yield average MEP amplitude 1 mV baseline ( T0 ) , keep constant throughout experiment . EEG Biofeedback protocols Parameters : Recording amplifier : Mitsar-EEG 201© Electrode positioning : 19 electrode position accord standard 10/20 system use EEG cap gel electrodes routinely use hospital EEG evaluation EEG-biofeedback therapy . ROI : right M1 ( fix Talairach coordinate : 34 , -18 , 35 ) right SPG ( fix Talairach coordinate : 24 , -55 , 50 ) Frequency goal : Elevating hi-alpha frequency , threshold set subject individually first quartile hi-alpha current density distribution first 120 second train session . Visual stimulus : An emotionally neutral movie ( nature scene ) . Reinforcement method : The current source density ROI co vary picture quality mean white visual noise added picture . As participant get close pre-defined threshold ( see ) , vision become clear . According neurofeedback hypothesis clearer image video presentation reinforce last change brain activity trained region . All procedure consider safe standard routinely use treatment research minimal side effect symptom report last 40 year apply therapeutic method .</detailed_description>
