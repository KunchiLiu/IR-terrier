	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Triheptanoin ( UX007 ) Treatment Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome ( Glut1 DS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY : UX007G-CL201 randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , study assess safety efficacy UX007 Glut1 DS . The study enroll pediatric , adolescent , adult subject currently , compliant ketogenic high fat diet . Enrolled subject otherwise able maintain standard care treatment 1-3 AEDs throughout duration study . Beginning screen visit , subject record seizure frequency 6-week Baseline Period . If subject meet seizure count criterion , subject consider screen failure randomize . At end Baseline Period , eligible subject randomize 3:1 ratio either UX007 placebo . Dosing initiated use 2-week titration schedule subject reach 35 % total daily calorie study drug ( ~1-4 g/kg/day depend age ) . If subject reach target 35 % total daily calorie end 2-week titration period , dose titration continue maximum tolerate dose reach . Phase 2 study enroll approximately 40 subject . After initial 8-week double-blind Treatment Period , open-label Extension Period begin , wherein subject treat UX007 Week 52 study . A population-PK analysis Week 26 provide data metabolite level subject UX007 . Following Week 26 visit , approximately first 40 subject participate 10-week Dose Exploration Period assess impact UX007 dose level seizure control , clinical manifestation movement disorder cognitive deficit , tolerability . At end Dose Exploration Period , subject continue open-label Extension period , maintain UX007 dose ( determined Investigator ) provide maximum improvement clinical status acceptable tolerability , continue dose duration study . Long term safety maintenance effect UX007 assess Extension Period .</detailed_description>

Average least 2 observable seizure ( generalize partialonset [ simple partial motor , complex partial , absence , secondarily generalize seizure ) 4 week last 24 week , subject caregiver report 4 . At least 2 observable seizure ( generalize partialonset [ simple partial motor , complex partial , secondarily generalize seizure ) 4 week Baseline Period , 3week seizurefree period Baseline Period OR absence seizure document Screening EEG 5 . Continuing seizure despite prior current use least 1 AED 6 . Allowed 3 concomitant AEDs must stable dose least 2 week prior begin screen anticipated remain stable dose end 8week , placebocontrolled Treatment Period 7 . Not , fully compliant prescribe diet plan ( e.g . KD ) 8 . Plasma level betahydroxybutyrate ( BHB ) â‰¤ 1 mmol/L ( nonfasting ) Screening 9 . Provide write verbal assent ( possible ) write informed consent legally authorize representative nature study explain , prior researchrelated procedure 10 . Must , opinion investigator , willing able complete aspect study , comply accurate completion seizure diary , likely complete 8 week , placebocontrolled , Treatment Period 11 . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test Screening , willing use acceptable method contraception , additional pregnancy test study . Females consider childbearing potential include reach menarche , total hysterectomy , menopause least two year , tubal ligation least one year prior Screening . 1 . Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) level exceed 3X upper limit normal Screening 2 . Any known hypersensitivity triheptanoin safflower oil , judgment investigator , place subject increase risk adverse effect 3 . Prior use triheptanoin within 30 day prior Screening 4 . History , current suicidal ideation , behavior and/or attempt 5 . Pregnant and/or breastfeed infant Screening 6 . Participants unwilling unable discontinue use prohibit medication substance may confound study objective 7 . Use investigational product ( drug supplement , include medium chain triglyceride [ MCT ] oil ) within 30 day prior Screening , time study 8 . Has condition severity acuity , opinion investigator , warrant immediate surgical intervention treatment 9 . Has concurrent disease condition , laboratory abnormality , view investigator , place subject high risk poor treatment compliance complete study , would interfere study participation introduces additional safety concern ( e.g. , diabetes mellitus , concurrent neurological psychiatric disorder )</criteria>
