	<brief_title>Wearable Therapeutic Ultrasound Study Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 50 million people U.S. suffer form chronic pain , 60 % Americans 65 limited mobility knee hip Osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Pharmaceuticals currently dominate treatment option due widespread insurance coverage convenience . However , myriad public health problem associate analgesic use , include cost , untoward side effect , addiction potential opioid analgesic . Ultrasound therapy pain heal approve U.S. FDA use around globe last 60 year . Traditionally , ultrasound-mediated pain treatment deliver clinic limit short confine period 5-15 min acoustic intensity 1-4 W/cm2 course week month . Over past decade , research increasingly focus lower-intensity therapeutic ultrasound ( 30-1000 mW/cm2 ) deliver extended 1-8 hr period . ( mW = milliwatt ) Recent animal study use low-intensity therapeutic ultrasound ( LITUS ) demonstrate successful inflammation reduction , reduce cartilage degeneration , tendon fracture healing . It believe use lower-intensity ultrasonic treatment regimen extend treatment period work body 's natural healing process minimize acoustic insult compare traditional , high intensity treatment . This study propose evaluate clinically first wearable low intensity ultrasound system noninvasive treatment arthritis pain . This technology potential measurably increase quality life million people suffer osteoarthritis pain provide safe , effective , easy-to-use treatment . The pilot study test versatile ultrasound therapy system clinical study enroll 60 patient mobility-impairing knee OA . The goal study establish statistically significant data daily 4 hour LITUS treatment decrease participant pain ( Visual Analog Scale [ VAS ] ) improve patient mobility ( measure accelerometer worn participant ) placebo device .</detailed_description>
