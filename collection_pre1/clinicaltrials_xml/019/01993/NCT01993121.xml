	<brief_summary>The objective current proposal evaluate importance blood vessel dysfunction heart dysfunction overall exercise impairment type 2 diabetes contribution gender difference observe exercise capacity . Importantly , treatment improve blood vessel function person type 2 diabetes use directly assess whether impairment blood vessel function ultimately exercise performance , improve whether degree improvement differs sex . Hypothesis 1 . Uncomplicated type 2 diabetes adversely affect exercise capacity woman men . Hypothesis 2 . Blood vessel function cardiac function significantly impaired woman type 2 diabetes men contribute gender difference exercise capacity . Hypothesis 3 . Restoration blood vessel function improve exercise capacity woman men type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects come total seven research visit . Four initial study visit exercise train three month subject repeat test . 1 . Initial exam . A history physical exam perform . Blood drawn measurement overall health . Resting electrocardiogram obtain . The Low Level Physical Activity Recall ( LOPAR ) questionnaire administer . 2 . Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) carry visit two . A familiarization bicycle ergometer test also perform day . 3 . During visit three , euglycemic clamp perform . 4 . During visit four , echocardiographic measurement make diet interview perform . 5 . On visit five , measure blood vessel-dependent vasodilation perform . Repeated brachial artery diameter forearm blood flow response cuff occlusion measure separately occasion . 6 . On visit six , arterial stiffness measure . Subjects also perform graded bicycle exercise test . 7 . On visit seven , subject perform constant level bicycle test .</detailed_description>
