	<brief_summary>Background : - The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy involve take white blood cell patient ' tumor , grow laboratory large number , give cell back patient . These cell call Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes , TIL give type treatment 400 patient melanoma . - In trial , determine difference response patient receive prior anti-PD1 treatment receive prior ant-PD1 treatment . Objectives : - To determine difference rate response patient receive prior anti-PD1 . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year less equal 70 year age metastatic melanoma . Design : - Work stage : Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Surgery : Surgery biopsy perform obtain tumor grow white blood cell . White blood cell grown tumor laboratory . - Leukapheresis : Participants leukapheresis collect additional white blood cell . ( Leukapheresis common procedure remove white blood cell patient . ) - Treatment : Participants receive standard dose chemotherapy prepare immune system accept white blood cell . Participants receive infusion white blood cell grown tumor . They also receive aldesleukin five day boost immune system response white blood cell . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . - Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Adoptive cell therapy ( ACT ) use autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte mediate regression bulky metastatic melanoma administer along high-dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine . - In series consecutive trial use chemotherapy preparative regimen alone 2 Gy 12 Gy total body irradiation ( TBI ) objective response rate use RECIST criterion 49 % , 52 % , 72 % , respectively . Of 20 complete regression see trial , 19 on-going 70 114 month . - The chemotherapy alone preparative regimen require in-patient treatment associate significant neutropenia thrombocytopenia require multiple transfusion treatment febrile neutropenia . Objectives : - With amendment D , determine difference rate response patient receive prior anti-PD1 ; group receive non-myeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen follow autologous young TIL administration high dose aldesleukin . - To determine toxicity treatment . Eligibility : - Age great equal 18 less equal 70 year - Evaluable metastatic melanoma - Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable surgical resection preparation TIL - No contraindication high-dose aldesleukin administration - No concurrent major medical illness form immunodeficiency Design : - Patients metastatic melanoma lesion resect TIL growth establish , patient receive ACT TIL plus aldesleukin follow high dose chemotherapy preparative regimen . - Up 64 patient may enrol 4-5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Measurable metastatic melanoma least one lesion resectable TIL generation . 2 . Confirmation diagnosis metastatic melanoma Laboratory Pathology NCI . 3 . Patients 3 few brain metastasis less 1 cm diameter asymptomatic eligible . Lesions treat stereotactic radiosurgery must clinically stable 1 month treatment patient eligible . Patients surgically resect brain metastasis eligible . 4 . Greater equal 18 year age less equal 70 year age . 5 . Ability subject understand willingness sign Informed Consent Document 6 . Willing sign durable power attorney . 7 . Clinical performance status ECOG 0 , 1 2 . 8 . Patients gender must willing practice birth control time enrollment study four month treatment . 9 . Serology : Seronegative HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immunecompetence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , seronegative hepatitis C antibody . If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen RTPCR HCV RNA negative . 10 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus . 11 . Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm ( 3 ) without support filgrastim WBC great equal 3000/mm ( 3 ) Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm ( 3 ) Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl 12 . Chemistry : Serum ALT/AST less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal Serum Creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dl Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . 13 . More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , patient toxicity must recover grade 1 less ( except toxicity alopecia vitiligo ) . Patients must progressive disease prior treatment . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less . 14 . Four week must elapse time antibody therapy could affect anti cancer immune response , time patient receives preparative regimen allow antibody level decline . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus infant . 2 . Any form primary immunodeficiency ( Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease ) . 3 . Concurrent opportunistic infection ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity ) . 4 . Active systemic infection , coagulation disorder active major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system , evidence positive stress thallium comparable test , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease . 5 . Concurrent systemic steroid therapy . 6 . History severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction agent use study . 7 . History coronary revascularization ischemic symptom . 8 . Documented LVEF less equal 45 % , test require patient : Age great equal 60 year old Clinically significant atrial ventricular arrhythmia include limited : atrial fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia , second third degree heart block .</criteria>
