	<brief_summary>Background : - VRC01 manmade antibody direct human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Antibodies fight infection . Researchers eventually want know VRC01 help prevent treat HIV infection . In study want know study drug safe take vein skin . Taking VRC01 study protect HIV infection . Objectives : - To see VRC01 placebo safe well tolerate . Eligibility : - Healthy adult 18 50 year old . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , lab test . - Participants randomly divide 4 group . VRC01 placebo give week 1 4 . Blood sample take several time VRC01 placebo dose . - Three group receive VRC01 needle vein IV pump . It take 1 hour do hospital . - One group receive either VRC01 placebo needle fatty tissue skin , usually belly . It take 20 minute do hospital . - Participants stay hospital overnight receive medication 14 clinic visit 4 month . Most clinic visit last 2 hour . - Participants keep symptom diary receiving medicatino . - Participants volunteer mouth , rectal , genital sample take throughout study . - The study last 8 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Safety Pharmacokinetics Human Monoclonal Antibody , VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB ( VRC01 ) , Administered Intravenously Subcutaneously Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This first study healthy adult VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB ( VRC01 ) monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) . It dose-escalation study examine safety , tolerability , dose , pharmacokinetics VRC01 . The hypothesis VRC01 safe administration healthy adult intravenous ( IV ) subcutaneous ( SC ) rout elicit hypersensitivity reaction . A secondary hypothesis VRC01 detectable human serum definable half-life . The SC route evaluation placebo-controlled conduct double-blinded evaluate safety tolerability VRC01 placebo ( VRC-PLAMAB068-00-AB ) . Products Description : VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB ( VRC01 ) human MAb target HIV-1 CD4 bind site . It develop VRC/NIAID/NIH manufacture cGMP Vaccine Pilot Plant ( VPP ) operate Leidos Biomedical Research , Inc. ( formerly SAIC-Frederick , Inc. ) , Frederick , MD . Vials provide 100 plus minus 10 mg/mL volume 2.25 mL/vial . VRC-PLAMAB068-00-AB ( placebo ) sterile , buffer aqueous solution 25 mM Sodium Citrate , 50 mM Sodium Chloride , 150 mM L-Arginine Hydrochloride , 10 % Dextran 40 ( w/w ) , 0.005 % Polysorbate 80 ( w/w ) pH 5.8 . The placebo fill 2.25 plus minus 0.1 mL/vial 3 mL glass vial . Subjects : Healthy adult , 18-50 year age . Study Plan : There 3 open-label , dose escalation group ( Groups 1 , 2 , 3 ) IV administration 1 blind , placebo-controlled group ( Group 4 ) SC administration . Enrollment start subject randomization Groups 1 4 1:2 ratio . Within Group 4 , subject randomize SC administration VRC01 placebo 1:1 ratio . No one subject per day group receive first IV infusion study product , one subject per week receive first SC infusion first 6 subject Group 4 . If first infusion administer discontinuation study sufficient data conduct dose escalation review group , extra subject may enrol group order requisite data least 3 subject . Safety review IV Groups conduct 2 week third subject completes Day 0 infusion . Safety review Group 4 conduct 2 week sixth subject completes Day 0 infusion . After IV dose escalation complete , additional slot ( 2 per schedule ) may fill schedule assess safe well tolerate . The total accrual 5 per schedule provide additional safety PK data well inform product development . The additional enrollment slot fill equal randomization subject 5 study schedule enroll . When complete randomized enrollment , additional subject may enrol may receive single VRC01 dose evaluate long-term pharmacokinetics . Subjects admit inpatient unit remain 24 hour follow product administration . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample collect product administration baseline specify interval 28 day product administration 56 day second product administration . Due need incur 3 day disruption normal daily activity begin first infusion , enrollment day likely different Day 0 . Safety lab sample collect baseline , 2 , 7 , 14 , 28 day product administration . Subjects keep daily diary solicit systemic symptom 3 day administration . Blood sample human anti-VRC01 antibody evaluation drawn Days 0 , 14 56 . In group subject agrees , oral rectal fluid sample obtain specified interval product administration ; woman also offer cervical fluid sample collection . Study Duration : The study project take 32 week complete use follow assumption : - Individual subject follow 12 week last VRC01 administration ; - All dosage group complete ; - Enrollment 3 subject IV group per week IV dose escalation ; - Enrollments Group 4 begin time Group 1 . - Additional subject begin randomize schedule assess safe well tolerate begin Week 16 , estimate 4 week complete accrual 12 week complete follow last enrolled subject .</detailed_description>
