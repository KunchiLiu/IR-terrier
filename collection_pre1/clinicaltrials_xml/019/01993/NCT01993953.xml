	<detailed_description>Background Regular physical activity confers protection number physical mental health disorder ( Hallal et al 2006 ; Bauman 2004 ) . Physical activity also produce health benefit relate overall physical fitness physical performance ( Kruk 2007 ; Pedersen &amp; Saltin 2006 ; Kesaniemi et al 2001 ) . Physical activity prevent cardiovascular disease ( Adedeji et al 2011 , Anderssen &amp; Hjermann 2000 ) , type 2 diabetes ( Admiraal et al 2011 ) , type cancer ( Courneya &amp; Friedenreich 2011 , Friedenreich 2001 ) mental illness e.g anxiety depression ( Harris et al 2006 ; Pedersen &amp; Saltin 2006 ) . Despite knowledge benefit regular physical activity , inactivity grow global problem ( Kohl et al 2012 ) . At time prevalence overweight ( BMI≤25 ) obesity ( BMI≤30 ) double 1980 2008 . In region , Europe America , 50 % woman overweight ( Perèz Rodrigo 2013 ) . About 35 % world 's population 20 year suffer overweight , 12 % obese ( WHO , 2008 ) . In Norway around one five adult develop obesity ( Ulset et al 2007 ) . During last two decade fitness industry worldwide increase considerably number center number member , , major change train opportunity ( Bakken Ulseth 2003 ; Ommundsen &amp; Aadland 2009 ) . In 1987 , 8 % adult Norwegian population report exercise fitness centre , compare 25 % 2007 ( Ommundsen Aadland 2009 ) . Today fitness industry arena woman seek start physical activity ( Vaage , 2004 ) , little research factor related physical activity among choose physically active fitness-centres . Resistance train become popular form exercise woman men age , especially woman resistance train today past ( Breivik , 2010 ) . The health benefit resistance train many . With proper dosage regular exercise increase muscle connective tissue cross-sectional area bone mineral density , improve functional capacity , reduce body fat , increase basal metabolic rate , decrease blood pressure , improve blood lipid value , glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity ( Kelley &amp; Kelley 2000 ; Pollock et al 2000 ; Feigenbaum &amp; Pollock 1999 ) . These benefit , well performance-related benefit , improve quality life different population , overweight obesity ( Pollock et al 2000 ) . The effect muscle strength varies study , may attribute factor study design , method genetics . Yet untrained people generally expect increase 1RM ( one repetition maximum ) 30-40 % 12 week ( Raastad et al 2010 ) . Increase muscle volume ( hypertrophy ) untrained individual seem best achieve load 60-80 % 1 RM ( 6-15 repetition ) . Increase maximum strength untrained locate 70-85 % 1 RM ( 4-8 rep ) , local endurance strength 20-60 % 1 RM ( 15 repetition ) ( Raastad et al 2010 ) . Body Pump With increased activity fitness industry provision premade training session concept increase accordingly . Within group-training class , several different concept focus muscle strength . Best known worldwide Body Pump ( BP ) Les Mills ( www.lesmills.com ) . Les Mills International around since 1997 originally New Zealand . Entrepreneur , Phillip Mills , develop series group-training class music , include BP . Today , 14 000 fitness center world offer group-training class Les Mills . In Nordic country 1039 centre offer BP , 179 Norway ( www.lesmills.com ) . BP intend increase muscle strength local muscular endurance , reduce fat mass ( change body composition ) , well maintain increase lean body mass ( Les Mills International Limited 2007 ) . The class contain 10 12 strength training exercise barbell , weight step , pre-choreographed instructor . Number repetition throughout class varies muscle group , generally high . Les Mills certify instructor offer refresher course four time year . The fitness center offer BP pay monthly license receive new program four time year . Les Mills advertise BP suitable woman men , train session burn 600 calorie , increase muscle strength , improve public health , strengthen bone give sense good wellbeing ( www.lesmills.com ) . Currently study examine effect BP similar group-training class physical mental health . Oliveria et al ( 2009 ) examine effect muscle activity single workout class BP . They conclude BP improve muscle strength , probably affect cardiorespiratory factor . Internally publish report University Auckland examine long-term effect BP ( Lythe et al 2000 ) , well energy consumption single workout ( Pfitzinger &amp; Lythe 1999 ) . Lythe et al recruit inactive woman men ( n = 40 ) , intervention period 13 week training ( 2-4 session per week ) . The result show significant reduction skinfold thickness measure caliper , exercise dietary change make . They also find increase muscle strength ( 6 RM bench press legpress ) positive effect psychological factor self-esteem self-image . This study control group ( Lythe et al 2000 ) . Another internal report examine energy consumption one session , find calorie consumption average 483 calorie men 338 calorie woman ( Pfitzinger &amp; Lythe 1999 ) . The subject study experience regular BP three month ahead poll . Greco et al ( 2011 ) conduct RCT examine muscle strength change endurance 12 week BP 19 untrained woman ( 2 session per week ) . The result show change either endurance body composition . However , find significant change maximal muscle strength lower body muscular endurance ( Greco et al 2011 ) . Personal Trainer A relatively new profession , emerge past 20 year Norway internationally , Personal Trainer ( PT ) . PT ` produce train program client , follow long period . They also instruct proper execution technique , correct training , control intensity serve motivator ( Ratamess et al 2008 ) . The title `` personal trainer '' protect , exact number PT ` Norway unknown . Besides PT , fitness center offer train manual one hour instruction , include membership . They also offer one hour follow individual coaching week , member carry train ( www.sats.no ) . To knowledge one RCT examine impact training PT ( Mazetti et al 2000 ) . During 12-week training program find participant manage train heavier weight PT , compare group without personal trainer . The group PT also show great improvement muscle strength great increase 1 RM . In addition study find exercise PT subsequently choose heavy load without PT . A cross-sectional study find customer choose heavy load great strength gain train period PT , compare group without PT ( Ratamess et al 2008 ) . To date , little known effect BP , despite large number participant perform group-training session daily . There also many unanswered question regard effect exercise PT , differences efficacy exercise group , PT alone . The question related field important relation general public health perspective , well time finance customer put concept . This study well-designed RCT , main purpose investigate effect regular muscle strength change body composition overweight ( BMI ˂ 25 ) `` regularly exercise '' woman age 18-65 year , 12 week BP , compare inactive control group . The study four armed also measure energy expenditure one session BP . At time , project investigate effect muscle strength change body composition group training , respective without , PT .

A randomized controlled trial . - Muscle Pain Injuries adult overweight female 12 week Body Pump traditional strength training without personal trainer . Method Participants The study recruit `` regularly exercise '' woman age 18-65 , BMI ≥ 25.0 . `` Not regular exercise '' define study `` regularly exercise one hour 14th day '' ( Ommundsen &amp; Aadland 2009 ) . Recruitment take place via various social medium channel , like facebook NIH ` homepage . Power Calculations Power calculation do collaboration Professor Statistics , Ingar Holme , NIH . The BP group compare inactive control , group C ( resistance training instructor ) compare group B ( PT ) . With standard deviation 15 % , alpha = 5 % , statistical power 80 % , need recruit 30 subject group detect difference 11 % muscle strength ( effect size : 0.73 ) . We expect loss participant 10-20 % throughout study period . Hence , recruit 36 woman group total 144 participant ( Greco et al 2011 ) . Training According BP product manual recommend exercise concept 2-3 time week ( www.lesmill.com ) . This accordance recommendation resistance train Health Social Services Agency inactive people , 2-3 time weekly ( SEF , 2000 ) . In BP session exercise squat , deadlift , bench press , stand forward row , french press , biceps curl , shoulder press abdominal crunch . These exercise form basis development train program group B C well . All participant use train diary adherence .</detailed_description>
