	<brief_summary>The goal research understand function 'regulatory circuit ' brain . These brain circuit allow person regulate attention , regulate behavioral response , regulate decision-making . We also interest stimulant medication methylphenidate naltrexone affect regulatory circuit . Methylphenidate widely-used , FDA approve medication use treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) also know Ritalin . Naltrexone FDA approve medication use help treat alcohol substance abuse . This research study use scan technique know functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) take special kind picture brain enable u `` see brain work '' . Adult participant give one-time dose either methylphenidate , naltrexone , placebo fMRI scan session . There three total fMRI scan session . Therefore , participant receive possible medication/placebo . Thus , use fMRI technique , main purpose research well understand function regulatory circuit condition ADHD alcohol dependence . This research may one day help u develop good treatment disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To ensure safety every subject administration drug compound , subject must first undergo urine drug test female , urine pregnancy test ingestion drug compound . Concurrently , subject alcohol dependence must undergo breathalyzer well urine drug pregnancy test ( female ) ingestion drug compound fMRI scan session . Once subject administer drug compound Rachel Upjohn Building University Michigan , study coordinator train study personnel ride subject taxi cab ride scanner facility . For detailed information regard drug administration please see section . Once scanner facility , subject fill MRI Safety form every scan ensure able enter magnet safely . After form complete sign , subject undergo practice session fMRI task private practice room designate activity scanner facility . Once task practice MRI technician prep subject make sure metal person enter scanner . All subject scanner approximately 65 minute perform task list detail section . Post scan , study coordinator train study personnel escort subject back Rachel Upjohn Building University Michigan via taxi study debriefing .</detailed_description>
