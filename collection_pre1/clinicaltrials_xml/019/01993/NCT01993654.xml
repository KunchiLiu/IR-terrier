	<brief_summary>This study aim validate use laser vivo confocal microscopy early diagnostic differentiation tool pigment conjunctival lesion , evaluate efficacy vivo confocal microscopy follow-up ( visualize tool ) tumor resection early detection tumor recurrence , evaluate use vivo confocal microscopy evaluation response treatment . The modified technique Heidelberg Retina Tomography ( HRT ) confocal microscopy anterior segment optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) non-invasive , no-touch , image technique may help differentiation benign lesion like nevi racial melanosis , malignant lesion like primary acquire melanosis malignant melanoma . The OCT potentially allow estimate tumor depth vivo preliminary study show .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Conjunctival melanoma potentially lethal neoplasm , average 10-year mortality rate 30 % , 15-year mortality rate 45 % . This condition occur mainly white population , rare report black non-white population . Recent study indicate like cutaneous melanoma , incidence conjunctival melanoma increase . Conjunctival Malignant Melanoma ( MM ) also currently diagnose base upon clinical ground , observation growth suspect lesion regular interval time . Unfortunately simple slit lamp examination currently clinical diagnostic visual instrument available medical practice , early diagnosis MM slit-lamp examination still rather poor . Further diagnosis invasive conjunctival MM currently establish conjunctival excisional biopsy define invasion underlie substantia propria conjunctiva atypical tumor cell , especially loss maturation . Regarding management malignant melanoma , unfortunately extensive horizontal even vertical growth neoplasm always lend simple excision lead exenteration . As vision-sparing alternative , local excision cryotherapy become treatment choice . Long-term follow-up show local recurrence common . More recently , topical chemotherapy mitomycin C ( MMC ) use treat case extensive PAM atypia , pigment margin use guide conservative treatment , tumor 's edge may miss . Recurrent conjunctival MM often present amelanotic mass may mistake pyogenic granuloma patient multiple previous excision conjunctival MM , even though original tumor may pigment . Because lack pigment , tumor remain unrecognized progressively enlarge , especially patient previous surgery conjunctival scar . In addition , tumor margin recurrent amelanotic conjunctival MM may indistinct . These factor lead delay recognition unnecessary need exenteration . Despite radical procedure , usually lead loss vision eye , patient show poor survival rate , suggest metastasis already occur time treatment . This confirm extent disease diagnosis important factor determine outcome . Recurrence conjunctival MM report 26 % 5 year , 51 % 10 year . MM conjunctival represent one greatest challenge early preventive detection . Whereas surgical excision early stage tumor development almost always curative , delayed recognition put patient risk destructive growth death tumor progress competence metastasis . Accurate diagnosis pigment lesion conjunctiva nevus , primary , secondary acquire melanosis MM present challenge ophthalmologist pathologist . It possible clinically distinguish PAM without atypia . The ability detect early MM remain paramount importance effort curtail death related malignancy . The implementation utilization vivo image technology clinical practice would enhance ability detect MM cancer early stage curable . Further , accurate assessment therapeutic tumor response critical evaluation chemotherapy result patient , clinical trial . Tumor response also guide clinician patient study . Early , accurate prediction non-response would allow early change second-line treatment , thus spar patient 's unnecessary toxicity , psychological morbidity delay initiation effective treatment . These variable investigator , clinician , control regard management conjunctival MM . However , early detection , technique time surgery may ultimate tumor recurrence , need orbital exenteration , tumor metastasis , patient death . This non-invasive imaging technique available clinical study might help early detect prevent mention problem .</detailed_description>
