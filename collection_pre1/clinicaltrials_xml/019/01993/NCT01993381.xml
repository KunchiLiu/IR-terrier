	<brief_summary>The common toxicity chemotherapy nausea vomiting , appropriate management toxicity help patient improve tolerance chemotherapy . Anti-emetics include dopamine antagonist , serotonin antagonist , substance P antagonist administer patient accord emetogenic risk chemotherapeutic drug . However , patient n't always experience nausea vomit drug . Therefore , important determine biomarker predict chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting . Some biomarkers study do chemotherapy . However definite evidence relation biomarkers chemotherapy . We hope find predictive biomarker CINV .</brief_summary>
