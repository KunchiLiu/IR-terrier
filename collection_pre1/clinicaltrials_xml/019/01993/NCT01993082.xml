	<detailed_description>The investigator prospectively examine whether aerobic train intervention alter marker immune cell age ( i.e . increase telomerase activity peripheral blood mononuclear cell , telomere length peripheral blood mononuclear cell leukocytes , mitochondrial function , epigenetic profile , mRNA expression ) , improve exercise capacity blood pressure , decrease psychological distress 24 week 32 caregiver compare 32 age-matched wait list control caregiver . Our sample comprise caregiver provide unpaid care family member diagnose Alzheimer 's disease dementia . Participants study highly stress inactive male female caregiver family member Alzheimer 's disease dementia . All eligible participant complete one week ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) examine whether ( 1 ) previously unfit , high-stressed caregiver benefit psychologically become active , ( 2 ) benefit derive change caregiver react recover stressful event , ( 3 ) whether salubrious psychological effect mediate change biological outcome ( e.g. , cellular age ) . Next , participant participate one-week run-in period stretch 30 minute 4 separate day prior randomization guarantee investigator randomize well-informed participant willing able complete expect exercise . Next , participant randomize aerobic exercise wait list control arm . In 24th week study , participant complete second week EMAs sub-study , return week 24 final blood draw . Research study assessment consist self-report questionnaire , body composition , physical performance fitness test , fast blood draw . The follow-up visit , 24 week later , consist repeat morning health visit .</detailed_description>
