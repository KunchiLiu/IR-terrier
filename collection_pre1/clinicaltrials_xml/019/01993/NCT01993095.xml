	<detailed_description>Persons MS less likely active healthy counterpart , statistic compound symptom manifestation MS . However , increase evidence support importance physical activity MS . Unfortunately , structure , safe , efficacious physical activity program often conduct medical university setting often accessible many old adult without MS. We propose conduct randomize control pilot trial test efficacy DVD-delivered physical activity intervention target factor potential reduce disability old adult MS . This DVD-based intervention previously approve IRB University Illinois similar study low-active , community-dwelling older adult ( IRB Protocol Number : 09765 ) . This novel intervention provide systematic , programmatic activity alternative version exercise allow individual capability complete program successfully . It focus improve flexibility , strength , balance demonstrate feasible , well-accepted , efficacious large sample old adult without MS . Importantly , intervention result clinically significant improvement Short Physical Performance Battery , reliable determinant disability , institutionalization , morbidity , mortality . If intervention equally successful old person MS , could considerable public health impact .</detailed_description>
