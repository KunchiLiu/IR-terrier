	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) Lewy body 's dementia ( LBD ) two frequent neurodegenerative pathology . They differ expression , evolution share feature make diagnosis uneasy . Constructional apraxia describe disease.The underlying mechanism less study could different AD LBD . The definition constructional apraxia purely descriptive model inconclusive . It admit draw task involve visuo-perceptive visuo-spatial ability , executive function work memory well purely `` constructive '' skill . Regarding different study , visuo-perceptive ability severely impaired LBD AD consider early onset sign disease . Executive function deficit document AD LDB could contribute draw impairment . It possible compensate planning disorder give patient best strategy use . If draw impairment persists , result others mechanisms like visuo-perception , visuo-spatial constructive deficit . The investigator suggest give best planning strategy help AD patient suppose fail raison executive impairment , LDB group suppose present visuo-perceptive deficit . An MRI propose study cerebral area involve constructional apraxia .</brief_summary>
