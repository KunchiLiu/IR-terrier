	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study proton chemoradiotherapy see well work compare photon chemoradiotherapy treating patient stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor , photon proton beam radiation therapy , may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , carboplatin , etoposide , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether proton chemoradiotherapy effective photon chemoradiotherapy treat non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Photon Therapy To Proton Therapy To Treat Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) patient stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) image guide , motion-managed photon radiotherapy ( Arm 1 ) image guide , motion-managed proton radiotherapy ( Arm 2 ) give concurrent platinum- base chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare 2-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) 2 arm . II . To compare development grade 3 high adverse event definitely , probably , possibly relate treatment . III . To compare difference two arm quality life ( QOL ) base primarily development shortness breath 6 month secondarily development sore throat end chemoradiotherapy ( chemoRT ) ( measure lung cancer module MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [ MDASI-Lung ] ) , well breathe relate functioning impairment measure Shortness Breath Questionnaire [ SOBQ ] . IV . To compare cost-effectiveness outcome 2 arm . V. To compare pulmonary function change treatment arm response . VI . To explore appropriate clinically relevant technological parameter ensure quality effectiveness throughout radiation therapy process , include imaging , simulation , patient immobilization , target critical structure definition , treatment planning , image guidance delivery . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo photon beam radiation therapy 5 day per week total 35 fraction receive either paclitaxel* intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour carboplatin* IV weekly radiation therapy etoposide IV day 1-5 29-33 cisplatin IV day 1 , 8 , 29 , 36 . ARM II : Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy 5 day per week total 35 fraction receive either paclitaxel* carboplatin* etoposide cisplatin Arm I . *In arm , patient receive paclitaxel carboplatin must complete consolidation therapy . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-8 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
