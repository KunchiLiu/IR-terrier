	<brief_summary>Disabling symptom blood pressure dysregulation , impair swallowing digestion common amongst Parkinson ` patient . So far exact pathophysiology fully understood . There result pathological analysis autonomic nervous system also affect accumulation alpha-Synuclein might even happen early stage disease process ( Qualman et al. , 1984 ; Wakabayashi et al. , 1989 ; Wakabayashi et al. , 1990 ; Bloch et al. , 2006 ) . Blood pressure dysregulation common autonomic symptom Parkinson ` patient treatment - currently often achieve Fludrocortisone - often lead supine hypertension ( Plaschke et al. , 1998 ; Braune et al. , 1999 ; Magerkurth et al. , 2005 ) . There study patient autonomic failure indicate Pyridostigmine bromide might alternative treatment option without cause disable supine hypertension ( Singer et al. , 2003 ; Sandroni et al. , 2005 ; Singer et al. , 2006 ; Yamamoto et al. , 2006 ) . Delayed gastric emptying also autonomic symptom associate Parkinson ` disease . By elevation cholinergic tone Pyridostigmine bromide investigator also expect alleviate symptom delay gastric empty obstipation , possibly even facilitate uptake dopaminergic medication gut ( Sadjadpour , 1983 ; Bharucha et al. , 2008 ) . Therefore investigator design monocentric randomize , control , double blind , crossover phase II trial show non-inferiority effect pyridostigmine bromide vs. fludrocortisone symptom autonomic dysregulation Parkinson ` disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In summary , investigator recent year become aware non-motor symptom PD impact affect individual . Therefore therapeutic strategy ameliorate symptom ever need . Sufficient clinical data treatment symptom blood pressure dysregulation still lack . This study aim close knowledge gap compare efficacy tolerability promise new agent , pyridostigmine bromide standard treatment , fludrocortisone . The propose target pyridostigmine respect autonomic ganglion efferent limb baroreflex . Via reduction acetylcholine breakdown sympathetic ganglionic transmission increase upon orthostatic stress ( Singer et al. , 2006 ) . Via mechanism aim facilitate gastrooesophageal motility gastric emptying : Both relaxation contractibility oesophagus know affected PD patient show manometric study ( Sung et al. , 2010 ) . Both relaxation contractability mainly influence nicotinergic muscarinergic , cholinergic vagal efferent oesophagus ( Chang et al. , 2003 ) . Via reduction acetylcholine breakdown aim increase cholinergic tone thereby normalize reduce relaxation contractibility . We also intent show faster gastric transit result faster absorption Madopar bloodstream - therefore measure Levodopa metabolites first 60mins ingestion 125mg fast-release Madopar serial venous blood sample via high-pressure liquid chromatography .</detailed_description>
