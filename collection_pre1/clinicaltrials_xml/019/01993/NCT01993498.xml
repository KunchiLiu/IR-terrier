	<brief_summary>The aim cohort quantify impact cancer treatment toxicity , generate predictor chronic toxicity patient non-metastatic breast cancer . The project include four specific aim : 1 . To develop database chronic treatment related toxicity cohort 20 000 woman stage I-III breast cancer ( = non metastatic ) , whatever treatment ( surgery ; radiation therapy ; chemotherapy … ) 2 . To describe incidence , clinical presentation , outcome chronic toxicity maximum 8 year . 3 . To describe psychological , social economic impact chronic toxicity . 4 . To generate predictor chronic toxicity order prevent , base upon biological criterion . The expected impact toxicity , identify , improve quality life decrease health cost , early identification patient high risk toxicity . Such early identification could lead prevent toxic effect : a. develop prevention strategy , b. substitute toxic treatment non ( less ) toxic one . Also , cohort offer quantification impact treatment toxicity , could use quantify medical usefulness strategy aim decrease treatment toxicity ( implementation predictive biomarker resistance , cytotoxic-free regimen etc… )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIM I : TO DEVELOP A TOXICITY DATABASE ON A COHORT OF 20,000 WOMEN WITH STAGE I-III ( NON METASTATIC ) BREAST CANCER Selection criteria The cohort include female patient non-metastatic breast cancer ( stage I-III ) without selection base characteristic ( except stage ) treatment . They may include concomitant clinical study . Patients sign inform consent benefit social security . The lack selection criterion relate fact cohort aim investigate toxicity whole population breast cancer public health perspective . Sample size The cohort plan include 20,000 woman 4 year . A cohort 20,000 patient allow detect two fold increase risk specific toxicity homogenous subgroup . As illustration , study present 90 % power detect whether variable ( age example ) observe 50 % patient associate increased risk toxicity ( heart toxicity ) specific subgroup ( Her2+++ ) . Development cohort The 20,000 patient recruit 20 cancer center , maximum France . The project start 14 center expand 6 additional center . These patient follow least 5 year context cohort . After 5 year , additional specific data capture year . Patients include time diagnosis , cancer specific treatment . After sign informed consent , patient fill first questionnaire demographic ( adapt French DREES reference study ) living condition , set validate questionnaire relate QoL ( BR 23 ) special psychological dimension . In addition , blood sample collect baseline . The toxicity ( event ) start collect 3 month end `` acute '' treatment ( surgery/adjuvant/chemotherapy/radiation therapy ) . Toxicity data also collect time last chemotherapy . Toxicities collect 6 month , alternatively dedicated nurse patient . Three set toxicity collect . - First , predefined previously describe toxicity collect dedicated item CRF . - Second , unknown toxicity capture use patient 's notebook patient collect event doctor ' visit ( general practictioner organ specialist ) . This allow capture event previously associate cancer treatment toxicity . - Finally , objective measurement paraclinic exam do . This include yearly blood test heart ultrasonography 1 5 year . In addition data collection , baseline blood sample genetic analysis do , serum sample collect baseline yearly 5 year ( serum ) . Outcome data also collect include metastatic relapse ( + site ) , locoregional relapse ( + site ) death . SPECIFIC AIM II : TO DESCRIBE INCIDENCE , CLINICAL PRESENTATION , BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOME OF CHRONIC TOXIC EVENTS This specific aim follow three goal : - First , investigator describe incidence predefined chronic toxicity accord treatment receive . - Second , investigator aim identify new treatment-related toxicity . This information capture dedicated notebook patient report health social related event . - Finally , investigator also assess outcome adverse event , try develop hypothesis addressed clinical trial . SPECIFIC AIM III : TO DESCRIBE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND THE SOCIAL IMPACTS OF TOXIC EVENTS This specific aim split two part : a. describe psychological social impact patient , b. describe impact population level . To describe psychological social impact patient Using robust well validate method , subjective objective dimension wellbeing investigated , : . Quality life b . Living condition c. Psychosocial issue . Quality life Global perception quality life assess SF-36 , QLQ-C30 BR 23 . Social impact Living condition assess questionnaire derive French DRESS reference study live condition . The initial questionnaire design DRESS investigate social , economical , professional condition two year diagnosis cancer : back abandonment initial professional/social activity , conversion , income trend , etc . Psychological impact This part focus psychological functioning , include psychological impact chronic toxicity psychological impact cancer . Psychological impact mainly expect emotional issue , cognitive disorder , body image sexual disorder . To describe impact society This sub-aim mainly focus medico-economics assess global impact treatment toxicity health economy . The quantification cost related toxicity major challenge since could allow identify avoidable major source expense could allow good tailor treatment accordingly . Specific partnership develop French social security public/private partner order accurately quantify toxicity-related cost . SPECIFIC AIM IV TO DEVELOP PREDICTORS FOR CHRONIC TOXICITIES In present specific aim , goal develop molecular/biologic predictor toxic event . In many case possible , investigator split cohort discovery set test set , identify cross-validating series analysis . Ultimately , goal develop multiparametric score predict occurrence toxicity . Regarding molecular predictor , plan 20 ml blood collect yearly . One sample baseline dedicate SNP array validation candidate genetic variant . A number test already plan . First , investigate conventional biological parameter include endocrine test ( cortisolemia , TSH , estradiol level , mullerian hormone… ) , metabolic test ( include lipidemia ) , hematologic test , liver function , immune function ( assessed lymphocyte count ) . Second , recent investigation test add include troponin ( heart failure ) , mullerian hormone , bone resorption marker ( bone loss ) , RANK / RANKL , osteoprotegerin ( bone loss ) . Finally , plan use baseline sample discovery genetic test use serum discovery biochemical predictor .</detailed_description>
