	<brief_title>Effects Intense Exercise Neural Responses Food .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It clear intense exercise impact peripheral appetite regulation , however little known impact high-intensity exercise central appetite regulation . This study aim investigate effect high-intensity exercise central peripheral response image food . Functional magnetic resonance technique use assess brain response image high low calorie food , follow short bout high-intensity exercise . Appetite hormone concentration also measure . It hypothesize , due know effect high-intensity exercise appetite regulatory hormone subjective appetite rating , activation reward-related brain region visual food cue would modulate follow intense physical activity .</detailed_description>
