	<brief_title>A Cohort Outpatients From French Research Memory Centers Order Improve Knowledge Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase incidence Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) relate disorder change world age demographic source major public health concern . Early accurate identification individual high risk Alzheimer 's Disease become priority . Over last year , research focus concept `` Mild Cognitive Impairment '' happen heterogeneous condition , depend study , Mild Cognitive Impairment patient ' conversion rate dementia range 2 15 percent per year . A study full range stage evolution , preclinical stage , clinical expression dementia death therefore utmost importance improve knowledge AD trigger development new treatment , especially stag transition relate neuroimaging ( either structural molecular ) , biological ( Cerebro-Spinal Fluid , serum plasma ) vascular damage marker . However , marker show individually associate worsen cognitive status , prior study simultaneously explore association large panel risk factor biomarkers progression early sign cognitive impairment AD large sample study participant . In parallel improve knowledge AD , also important well estimate social economic burden AD consequence individual circle evolve early phase ( pre-clinical ) disease severe stage . This cohort , solution item 29 Plan Alzheimer 2008-2012 , develop accord initial memorandum understanding prepared `` Comit√© Plan Cohortes '' Fondation Plan Alzheimer , take board comment provide Scientific Advisory Board ( July 2010 ) Fondation Plan Alzheimer whole work group constitute preparation pilot phase : clinician , neuro-imaging specialist , biologist , social science researcher ( June 2010 ) . The cohort build fulfil guiding principle follow : - It scientifically original identify hypothesis-driven research , allow corpus new confirmatory knowledge high-level evidence acquire . In addition , infrastructure ( standardise collection socio-demographic , clinical , image , biological data ) may allow respond , timely manner , additional question may emerge time ; - An interdisciplinary approach set condition individual affect neurodegenerative dementia involve clinical biological aspect also environmental , social economic component ; - While pursue original scientific objective , cohort potential comparison equivalent cohort around world . This cohort include individual high risk develop neurodegenerative dementia . As , cohort aim provide result expect impact individual profile , well caregiver case management . One expect impact increase knowledge progression early sign cognitive impairment AD estimate association sign level biomarkers assess image blood CSF sample . Another major expect impact standardise harmonise protocols term clinical neuro-psychological examination , biological marker , neuroimaging marker , diagnosis dementia , support caregiver informant .</detailed_description>
