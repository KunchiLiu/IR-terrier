	<brief_summary>Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) establish contribute cardiovascular comorbidities , malignancy high mortality . The management DM limit aggressively control sugar level diagnosis ; instead , emphasize effective modification prediabetics . Smoking cessation also demonstrate improve insulin resistance . Nowadays , 2nd-generation cessation program Taiwan bring high accessibility . However , little evidence long-term health outcome combine smoke cessation coach-assisted lifestyle change prediabetics community . The present new project extend original pilot project ( NSC 102-2628-B-002-046-MY2 MOST 104-2314-B-002 -072 ) August 2013 . The investigator make effort promote project cooperate primary care doctor community medical group corporate nurse . Over 446 prediabetic smoker enrol July 2017 . The invention include smoke cessation clinic 16 week ( January December 2017 ) coach-assisted lifestyle change ( January 2017 July 2020 later ) every participant join intervention . The lifestyle coach help participant intervention group reach goal least 7 percent weight loss within first 6 month . All smoker prediabetes intervention self-management group provide educational material lifestyle change . All prediabetic smoker prospectively follow every 6 month till July 2020 later smoke status , anthropometric index blood test . Regarding potential contribution national socio-economic development , project strengthen motivation smoke cessation prediabetic smoker . Academically , cox regression use investigate effectiveness smoke cessation combine coach-assisted lifestyle change DM prevention smoker prediabetes . This prospective project contribute community-based diabetes research preventive medicine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Smoking Cessation Clinics Combined With Coach-assisted Lifestyle Change Prediabetic Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan recruit study participant 1 ) individual abnormal glucose data employment health examination community adult preventive care service Yunlin Taipei ; 2 ) patient past history metabolic syndrome regularly followed-up National Taiwan University Hospital Yun-Lin branch . All participant give informed consent project medical record review , personal data protect . Only individual age 30 75 year include . A history diabetes , hypertension , FTND , alcohol consumption , physical activity , depression , sleep quality , current medication collect standardized personal interview . Prediabetics repeatedly either follow : 1 ) plasma glucose 100 125 mg/dL ( 5.6 6.9 mmol/L ) fast state ; 2 ) plasma glucose 140 199 mg/dL ( 7.8 11.0 mmol/L ) two hour 75-g oral glucose load ; 3 ) glycosylated hemoglobin ( A1C ) 5.7 % 6.4 % , absence diabetic medication . Prediabetics smoke ≥10 CPD least 6 month classify prediabetic smoker . Prediabetic non-smokers also recruit . According online sample size calculator ( www.openepi.com ) , investigator estimate recruit least 446 prediabetic smoker , case 33 % ( 149 ) join intervention program , reach 80 % power two-sided confidence interval 95 % detection 50 % risk reduction , assume 30 % risk incident DM 3-year follow-up prediabetic smoker join intervention program . Body height weight measure use single stadiometer , body mass index ( BMI ) calculate . The participant classify either normal underweight ( BMI &lt; 23 kg/m2 ) , overweight ( BMI 23 24.9 kg/m2 ) , obese ( BMI ≥25 kg/m2 ) , accord World Health Organization criterion Asian population . Waist circumference take end exhalation horizontal plane midway point inferior margin low rib iliac crest . Central obesity define waist circumference ≥90 cm men ≥80 cm woman , accord criterion metabolic syndrome use Taiwan ( www.hpa.gov.tw ) . Blood pressure ( BP ) measure electronic sphygmomanometer patient seat rest least ten minute . Each participant undergoes laboratory test fast least ten hour . Serological test include serum hepatitis B surface antigen , serum antibody hepatitis C virus , hepatitis B e antigen , determine via microparticle enzyme immunoassay ( Abbott Laboratories , Illinois , USA ) . Hepatitis B viral load hepatitis B carrier measure COBAS TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay ( Roche Diagnostics , Basel , Switzerland ) , detect upper limit 640,200,000 copies/mL low limit 35 copies/mL ( 1 copies/mL = 0.1718 IU/mL ) . Serum adiponectin level ( μg/mL ) determine use Procarta Cytokine Assay Kit ( Affymetrix , Inc. , California , USA ) investigator ' recent report . Plasma glucose level determine hexokinase method ( 1 mg/dL = 0.0555 mmol/L ) . Serum fast insulin level measure use COBAS electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ( Roche Diagnostics , Basel , Switzerland ) ( 1 μIU/mL = 6.945 pmol/L ) . Insulin resistance score determine homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) ,23 calculate follow formula : HOMA-IR score = fast insulin ( μIU/mL ) × fast glucose ( mg/dL ) /405 . Participants categorized insulin resistant HOMA-IR 2.5 high . Plasma lipid , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , creatinine level measure use Hitachi 7150 Automated analyzer ( Hitachi , Tokyo , Japan ) . Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) calculate use four-variable version Modification Diet Renal Disease Study equation Chinese Patients.25 Briefly , eGFR ( ml/min per 1.73 m2 ) = 175 × ( serum creatinine -1.234 ) × ( age -0.179 ) × 0.79 ( female ) . The hypertriglyceridemia define plasma triglyceride level ≥150 mg/dL ( 1.70 mmol/L ) ; hypercholesterolemia define plasma total cholesterol level ≥200 mg/dL ( 5.18 mmol/L ) . The low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) define serum HDL level &lt; 40 mg/dL ( 1.04 mmol/L ) men &lt; 50 mg/dL ( 1.29 mmol/L ) woman . Metabolic syndrome define clinically , base presence three American Heart Association/National Heart Lung Blood Institute ( AHA/NHLBI ) criterion : ( ) central obesity ; ( ii ) hypertriglyceridemia drug elevate triglyceride ; ( iii ) low HDL-C level drug reduce HDL-C ; ( iv ) high BP ( ≥130/85 mm Hg ) antihypertensive drug ; ( v ) high fast plasma glucose take anti-diabetic drug hyperglycemia . The International Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) criterion also apply define metabolic syndrome , participant central obesity plus two four component . After baseline assessment , prediabetic smoker provide educational material lifestyle change . All prediabetic smoker prospectively follow every 6 month till July 2020 later smoke status , FTND score , breath carbon monoxide ( CO ) level , anthropometric index blood test . Prediabetic non-smokers follow study . At visit , prediabetic smoker ask want join intervention include smoking cessation program coach-assisted lifestyle change . Randomization ethically allow study . Participants encourage weigh home daily minimum per week . Intervention group The invention include smoke cessation clinic 16 week ( January December 2017 ) coach-assisted lifestyle change ( January 2017 July 2020 later ) every participant join intervention . Participants decide join intervention refer smoke cessation clinic National Taiwan University Hospital Yun-Lin branch ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) . Participants group receive medication 16 week within one year . Each participant intervention group receive counsel individualize smoke cessation technique visit . In addition , participant assign two lifestyle coach give weekly standardize instruction diet physical activity help reach goal least 7 percent weight loss within first 6 month . Two lifestyle coach ( dietitian physical therapist ) responsible 40 participant . Each coach physical activity offer supervise physical activity session least two time per week ( perhaps cell phone apps ) . All lifestyle coach also contact participant weekly provide opportunity identify variety obstacle lifestyle change participant discuss behavioral approach improve specific problem . If participant bathroom scale home , give one . Emphasis place use scale important feedback learn tool well regulate personal diet exercise behavior . The investigator prescribe nicotine replacement therapy may induce insulin resistance confound study outcome . Bupropion available smoking cessation study institution . Varenicline user encourage either set quit day 8 day start medication ; 30 freely choose quit day time Days 8 35 start treatment ( i.e. , follow drug titration take place within first week ) .31 Varenicline user also forbid use nicotine replacement therapy study period . Varenicline administer accord manufacturer 's direction , 1- 4-week supply medicine prescribe every clinic visit . During therapy course , physicians allow adjust varenicline dosage accord tolerability . Drug adverse event , withdrawal symptom , perceive barrier quit record address . Physicians emphasize uncontrolled depressed mood , suicidal thought , attempt , cease varenicline treatment consult psychiatrist immediately . At end program , smoke status assess self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence , confirm breath CO level le 3 ppm.32 Cotinine use assess abstinence , use self-report indicate whether person smoke , CO cotinine level show high agreement.14,33 A senior registered nurse provide every participant join smoke cessation program individualize counsel help minimize relapse rate . Self-management group Participants decide NOT attend intervention program classify self-management group . All smoker prediabetes intervention self-management group provide educational material lifestyle change . They still provide educational material standardize diet exercise . They prospectively follow every 6 month till July 2020 later FTND score , breath CO level , anthropometric index blood test ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) . The skill body weight self-management ( goal least 7 percent weight loss least 150 minute physical activity per week ) 19 deliver educational material . Statistical analysis For descriptive analysis , value present either number ( percent ) mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . For univariate analysis , categorical data compare mean χ2 test Fisher exact test . Continuous variable compare use two-sample Student 's t-test . Statistical significance level determine two-tailed test ( P value &lt; 0.05 ) . In end enrollment ( July 2017 ) , investigator compare baseline characteristic among prediabetic smoker prediabetic non-smokers , stratify gender BMI group . Changes smoke habit prediabetic smoker record every 6 month July 2017 . In end follow-up , hazard ratio ( HRs ) 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CIs ) intervention ( smoking cessation program coach-assisted lifestyle change ) incident DM risk outcome parameter follow-up period estimate multivariate Cox regression model control age , gender , BMI ( time-varying covariate ) body weight change ( gainer , reducer , maintainer ) , BP , lipid , current medication , plasma ALT level , eGFR , daily coffee consumption , alcohol consumption , physical activity , depression , sleep quality . The per-protocol analysis perform ( Figure 1 ) . Only participant complete entire clinical trial accord protocol count towards final result . The independent variable `` intervention '' reserve prediabetic smoker succeed quit keep relapse . For fail quit keep relapse , still classify self-management group individual follow-up period study enrollment . The failure reach goal body weight reduction smoke cessation NOT change group assignment . The investigator assume miss value time miss random listwise deletion . The investigator test assumption proportional hazard Kaplan-Meier curve time fix covariates , create select time dependent variable inside PROC PHREG PROPORTIONALITY_TEST statement . Stratification analysis baseline BMI group may do . Additive multiplicative interaction change smoking status body weight DM risk also estimate . Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curve DM incidence quitter versus non-quitters draw . All abovementioned statistical analysis perform SAS software version 9.4 ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC , USA ) .</detailed_description>
