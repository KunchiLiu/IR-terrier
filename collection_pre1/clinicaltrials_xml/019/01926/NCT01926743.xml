	<brief_summary>Lymph node dissection gastric cancer surgery important factor exact acquisition stage also proper treatment . Realistically , impossible identify complete removal lymph node dissect nodal station naked eye . The investigator ass route lymphatic drainage identify residual lymph node dissect area . In field gastric cancer treatment , ICG near infra-red fluorescence imaging use detection sentinel lymph node . However , novel concept help understand lymphatic drainage make surgeon perform D1+ D2 lymph node dissection completely .</brief_summary>
