	<brief_summary>The purpose ENRICH study evaluate combination intervention package ( CIP ) design improve implementation Isoniazid Preventive Therapy ( IPT ) among people live HIV ( PLWH ) Ethiopia . The study two-arm cluster randomize trial , randomize HIV clinic level , include 10 HIV clinic Dire Dawa Harari , Ethiopia . Clinics randomize deliver combination intervention package ( CIP ) standard care ( SOC ) , stratification facility size ( &lt; 80 &gt; 80 patient enrol HIV care per year ) . The experimental intervention deliver patient HIV clinic randomly assign CIP initiate HIV care CIP site January 1 , 2013 initiate IPT date study initiation , July 1 , 2013 . In HIV clinic assign SOC , usual care procedure provision IPT deliver . Study Aims Hypotheses Aim 1 . Characterize compare effectiveness combination intervention package standard care IPT provision Ethiopia . Hypothesis 1.1 : IPT initiation new patient enrol HIV care CIP clinic higher newly enrol patient SOC clinic . Hypothesis 1.2 : Adherence completion IPT participant initiate IPT CIP clinic higher initiate IPT SOC clinic . Aim 1a . Assess acceptability CIP among participant enrol HIV care healthcare provider CIP clinic . Acceptability include : 1 ) perceive barrier facilitator uptake delivery intervention package among healthcare provider , 2 ) acceptability utilization intervention component well overall intervention package among IPT initiator non-initiators . Aim 2 . Assess impact CIP compare SOC HIV-related outcome . Hypothesis 2 : HIV-related outcome participant receive IPT CIP clinic superior outcome participant receive care SOC clinic . HIV-related outcome assess include retention care , among participant receive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , adherence ART CD4+ count . Aim 3 . Assess safety tolerability IPT among HIV-infected individual routine program condition Ethiopia . Aim 4 . Identify patient program characteristic associate IPT adherence completion SOC sit . Hypothesis 4.1 : IPT adherence completion associate modifiable patient characteristic , include ART status ; knowledge attitude IPT ; social support . Hypothesis 4.2 : IPT adherence completion associate modifiable program characteristic , include provider/patient ratio , patient tracking , patient support group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study intervention , combination intervention package ( CIP ) , contain programmatic , structural psychosocial component include : 1 ) health care provider train mentorship IPT provision use clinical algorithm ; 2 ) identification HIV-infected family member eligible IPT use family care enrollment form ; 3 ) review monitor data IPT initiation adherence monthly multidisciplinary team meeting ; 4 ) reimbursement transportation cost patient monthly clinic visit ; 5 ) real-time adherence support use interactive voice response ( IVR ) via mobile phone train peer educator . Data collect HIV-infected patient enrol HIV care study sit January 1 , 2013 ; subset patient initiate IPT enroll measurement cohort ( MC ) ; program characteristic survey conduct study site . Routine clinic data HIV-infected patient enrol HIV care 10 participate clinic January 1 , 2013 used measure follow outcome : IPT initiation , completion IPT , retention HIV care . These data collect Research Assistants ( RA ) abstract follow information clinic Pre-ART , ART ( antiretroviral therapy ) IPT register period observation HIV patient enrol care study site January 1 , 2013 : date enrollment HIV care ; IPT initiation ( yes/no ) ; date ART initiation ( applicable ) ; IPT outcome ( completion , default , death , stop , transfer ) ; TB ( tuberculosis ) screening result ; TB treatment ( yes/no ) ; TB treatment outcome ( applicable ) ; retention HIV care . A measurement cohort 500 HIV-infected patient initiate IPT July 1 , 2013 recruit 10 clinic ( n=250 per study arm ) . MC participant assess baseline ( enrollment ) monthly interval six nine month , depend duration IPT . Outcomes measure among MC participant include : adherence IPT ; adherence ART ( applicable ) ; change CD4+ count ; side effects/adverse event . MC participant SOC CIP sit receive assessment . RAs administer assessment day regularly schedule clinic visit , include Baseline interview administer day enrollment ( coincides day participant initiate IPT ) , monthly follow-up interview complete throughout IPT , end treatment interview complete day participant end IPT . Participants miss study visit contact study staff administer questionnaire phone within 1-week window period schedule clinic visit . RAs also call MC participant clinic visit conduct unannounced pill count assess medication adherence . In addition , 30 MC participant CIP sit participate qualitative interview ass feasibility acceptability Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) system , one intervention place CIP site . Also , three group recruit CIP clinic participate in-depth interview : IPT initiator , among participant Measurement Cohort ( n =15 ) , IPT non-initiators ( n=15 ) , healthcare provider ( nurse peer educator , n=13 ) . In-depth interview assess acceptability preference intervention component well reason IPT non-initiation . RAs conduct assessment programmatic activity HIV clinic prior study implementation monthly basis thereafter throughout study period . Clinics condition receive assessment . The RA administer brief semi-structured Program Characteristics survey ART nurse , familiar day-to-day operation HIV clinic . The survey assess nurse training mentorship IPT initiation HIV treatment ; availability use IPT clinical algorithm , IPT ART adherence training peer educator ( PEs ) ; IPT health education patient ; availability use IPT treatment literacy curriculum , include flip chart use PEs ; reimbursement transportation cost patient ; provision mobile phone , subscriber identification module ( SIM ) card airtime voucher HIV patient IPT ; use IVR message medication appointment reminder assessment medication adherence side effect ; provision community-based adherence side effect monitoring PEs . These data use assess fidelity intervention CIP sit , well measure potential contamination SOC sit . All clinical care perform clinic staff ( nurse PEs ) . All study procedure , include participant interview , pill count , medical record abstraction , program characteristic survey perform study staff ( research assistant ) . Following routine clinic visit , clinic staff refer patient initiate IPT study staff , screen eligibility , obtain informed consent , enroll consent eligible patient MC . In addition , RAs CIP sit provide part intervention , include disbursement mobile phone , SIM card , airtime voucher , cash transportation reimbursement eligible patient .</detailed_description>
