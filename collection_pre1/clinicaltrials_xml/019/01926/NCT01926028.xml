	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase 1b portion study compare NDV-3A vaccine , NDV-3 vaccine placebo head-to-head patient population interest ( woman RVVC ) evaluate safety immunogenicity . The study size compare safety immunogenicity ( N=15 per group ) base dose comparison design use study NDV3-001 ( clinical trials.gov Identifier NCT01273922 ) . The primary purpose Phase 2a portion study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity NDV-3A vaccine compare placebo patient population interest ( woman RVVC ) . The secondary purpose determine whether NDV-3A vaccine decrease recurrence rate VVC 18-50 year old woman RVVC compare placebo . The study size evaluate efficacy ( N=87 per group ) base assume 50 % rate VVC recurrences 6 month post-vaccination period placebo group 50 % vaccine efficacy .</detailed_description>
