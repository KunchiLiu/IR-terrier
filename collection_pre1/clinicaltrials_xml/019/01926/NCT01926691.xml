	<brief_summary>Background : Recent study demonstrate even mild stroke survivor experience residual damage , persist fact increase subsequent year . About 45 % stroke victim remain different level disability . While study cognitive impairment dementia stroke receive increase clinical attention , underlie pathophysiology poorly understood . Identifying mechanism involve recognize early biomarkers individual vulnerability , require multi-modal approach , mechanism involve cerebrovascular disease individual trajectories post-stroke recovery may impact upon various level . Aims Hypothesis : To date single measure use identify patient prone develop cognitive impairment disability well recovery prospect . We hypothesize data base biochemical , neuroimaging , genetic psychological measure , aggregate , serve good predictor subsequent disability , cognitive neurological deterioration , suggest possible intervention . Design : The TABASCO ( Tel-Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort ) study ongoing , prospective cohort study aim recruit approximately 1125 consecutive first-ever mild-moderate stroke patient . It design evaluate association predefined demographic , psychological , inflammatory , biochemical , neuro-imaging genetic marker , measure acute phase , long-term outcome : subsequent cognitive deterioration , vascular event ( include recurrent stroke ) , fall , affective change , functional everyday difficulty mortality . Discussion : This study attempt comprehensively investigate long term outcome mild-moderate stroke . Its prospective design provide quantitative data stroke recurrence , incidence vascular event evaluation cognitive , affective functional decline . Identifying factor associate post stroke cognitive functional decline could potentially yield effective therapeutic approach . We believe extensive approach analyze interaction different risk factor would accurately predict neurological deterioration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictors Poststroke Outcomes : Tel Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort Acute Stroke Cohort ( TABASCO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim TABASCO study identify predictor post stroke cognitive decline . A particular focus inflammatory stress marker , well neuroimaging measure . Eligibility Participants recruit patient admit Department Emergency Medicine Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center ( TASMC ) within 72 hour first-ever acute ischemic stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) symptoms onset . Criteria Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Age ≥ 50 year 2 . Israeli resident 3 . Acute stroke occur within last 3 day define : acute focal neurological deficit 4 . Written informed consent patient prior study participation 5 . Willingness participate follow-up Exclusion Criteria : patient present primary hemorrhagic stroke ( intracerebral subarachnoid ) 1. history precede cerebral vascular event ( exclude TIA ) 2. imminent death unconscious state 3. patient unlikely release hospital follow qualify stroke , severe disability qualify stroke make follow-up unlikely 4. know malignant disease chronic disease poor prognosis ( predict survival less two-years ) 5. stroke result trauma invasive procedure 6. patient prestroke history consistent dementia 7. severe aphasia . Stroke diagnosis verify senior vascular neurologist baseline demographic clinical data collect . Interviews conduct trained interviewer baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 18 month , yearly thereafter 10 year . Assessments data collection A senior vascular neurologist conduct thorough physical examination review image data medical record potential participant determine eligibility . Participants ask consent study examination sign informed consent obtain patient agree . Information collect evaluation co morbidity time recruitment throughout study . All subject prospectively follow three- , six- , 12 18 month stroke onset annually thereafter . Approximately three-months stroke , consent participant visit home train occupational therapist . For subject die , date death record along cause , base information obtain family , medical record , death certificate data government 's official civil registry . Sample size In attempt identify 40 % difference post stroke cognitive decline , calculate required sample size ( Ben Assayag E et al , International Journal Stroke , Vol 7 , June 2012 , 341-347 ) . We aim recruit least 1125 participant allow loss follow-up , potential clustering effect , miss data provide sufficient number multivariate modeling .
