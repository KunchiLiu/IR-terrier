	<brief_summary>With approximately 12 million cancer survivor today United States alone , increased attention give quality life cancer treatment . Cancer-related fatigue ( CRF ) one prevalent debilitate symptom experienced people cancer . It persist month year cancer therapy complete negative impact area function . Meaningful evidence-based treatment option CRF extremely limit find safe , inexpensive , effective intervention manage distress symptom urgently need . Basic research show activation immune system cause potent change behavior include reduce activity , fatigue , decrease social behavior . Furthermore , research last decade find relationship level CRF increase inflammation . Thus , study therapy may decrease immune system activation set CRF represent possible target intervention . Massage therapy one fast grow alternative therapy high rate acceptance symptom management among cancer patient . Massage show small study cancer patient modulate immune system . Moreover , massage demonstrate significantly decrease marker immune system activation normal subject . There publish randomize controlled trial examine either role massage intervention primarily CRF investigate whether massage relate decrease immune system activation responsible improvement CRF . This proposal investigate effect massage therapy CRF among breast cancer survivor . The investigator ' primary hypothesis Swedish Massage Therapy ( SMT ) decrease CRF compare light touch condition wait list control . The investigator ' secondary hypothesis SMT decrease CRF reduce immune system activation . The investigator ' main exploratory hypothesis decrease CRF increase quality life among cancer survivor .</brief_summary>
