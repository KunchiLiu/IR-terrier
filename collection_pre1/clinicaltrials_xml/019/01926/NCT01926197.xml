	<brief_title>Phase III FOLFIRINOX ( mFFX ) +/- SBRT Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Pancreatic Cancer Radiotherapy Study Group ( PanCRS ) Trial Primary Objective : To determine progression free survival mFFX +/- SBRT . Secondary Objectives : - To determine metastasis free survival follow mFFX chemotherapy alone SBRT . - To determine overall survival pancreatic cancer patient treat chemotherapy +/- SBRT . - To determine local progression-free survival pancreatic cancer patient chemotherapy +/- SBRT . - To evaluate acute ( within 3 month treatment ) grade 2 great gastritis , fistula , enteritis , ulcer grade 3-4 gastrointestinal toxicity within 3 month treatment . - To evaluate utility FDG-PET treatment plan estimation progression free survival . - To identify new biomarkers pancreatic cancer . - To evaluate quality life patient either chemotherapy chemotherapy SBRT .</detailed_description>
