	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized control trial look reduction catheter associate urinary tract infection postoperative period . It specifically look short gynecologic procedure D &amp; C ( dilation curettage ) , hysteroscopies LEEP procedure need perform intraoperative catheterization . If patient urinates immediately short operation need drain bladder catheter procedure . The investigator hypothesize eliminate catheterization short procedure may decrease postoperative urinary tract infection . The hope study would provide evidence support change practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Straight Catheterization Short Gynecologic Procedures Cause Bacteriuria ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority research currently concentrate indwell catheter rather one-time catheterization . Current practice institution gynecologic operate room perform one time catheterization patient 's undergoing short procedure , yet unclear necessary intervention . If patient ask void immediately procedure would eliminate need intra-operative catheterization eliminate potential source infection . The study design determine whether routine catheterization prior minor OB/GYN procedure cause symptomatic asymptomatic bacteria urine . Current practice one-time catheterization patient undergo minor OB/GYN procedure prior begin procedure . The investigator hypothesize cause asymptomatic symptomatic bacteriuria .</detailed_description>
