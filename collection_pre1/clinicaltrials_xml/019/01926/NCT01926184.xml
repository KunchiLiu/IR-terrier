	<brief_summary>In era HIV treatment prevention ( TasP ) , effort need identify evidence-based combination prevention approach achieve great decrease HIV viral load among population likely engage HIV transmission risk behavior . Because methamphetamine-using men sex men ( MSM ) great risk acquire transmit medication-resistant strain HIV , intervention target stimulant use population high-risk men could boost effectiveness TasP . At present , conditional cash transfer approach contingency management ( CM ) demonstrate short- term efficacy reduce stimulant use among substance-using MSM actively seek formal treatment . The propose RCT examine efficacy positive affect intervention design optimize effectiveness CM achieve long-term reduction stimulant use HIV viral load population . investigator ' team examine efficacy integrative intervention randomize control trial ( RCT ) 230 HIV-positive , methamphetamine-using MSM . After enrol CM , participant randomize receive either : 1 ) positive affect intervention ; 2 ) attention-matched control condition . Follow-up data collect 3 , 6 , 12 month post-randomization . This RCT provide opportunity examine efficacy integrative intervention design promote long-term reduction HIV viral load primary outcome . Secondary outcome examine include : increase positive affect , reduction stimulant use , improvement T-helper ( CD4+ ) count , decrease HIV transmission risk behavior . Identifying efficacious intervention approach decrease HIV viral load among methamphetamine-using MSM would substantially support goal National HIV/AIDS Strategy reduce HIV incidence mitigate HIV-related health disparity .</brief_summary>
