	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether fit patient ( ECOG performance score 0-1 ) advance biliary tract cancer ( ABC ) benefit chemotherapy second-line setting ( prior therapy cisplatin gemcitabine ) term overall survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Active Symptom Control Alone With mFOLFOX Chemotherapy Locally Advanced/ Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Active chemotherapy drug treatment ABC include gemcitabine , fluoropyrimidines platinum agent . The randomized NCRN phase III ABC-02 trial provide level A evidence support first-line combination cisplatin gemcitabine ( CisGem ) chemotherapy ABC . To date , randomize data support use second-line chemotherapy ABC . In set small number retrospective prospective ( phase II ) study employ multiple different chemotherapy schedule conduct ( level C ) . Thus , active symptom control ( ASC ) current standard care development resistance first-line chemotherapy . Oxaliplatin activity several gastrointestinal tumour synergistic activity favourable toxicity profile use combination 5-FU . Several study use mFOLFOX biliary tract tumour provide promising efficacy data acceptable toxicity . The aim trial determine patient ABC benefit respect survival addition mFOLFOX chemotherapy ASC second-line set progression first-line treatment CisGem . This study establish standard care patient ABC progress first line CisGem chemotherapy . This randomised phase III , multi-centre , control , open-label trial patient advance biliary tract cancer evidence disease progression prior CisGem chemotherapy treatment . Eligible patient ( ECOG 0-1 , adequate haematological , renal liver function , adequate biliary drainage , evidence ongoing infection ) randomize receive either ASC ( `` standard '' arm ) ASC oxaliplatin/5-FU chemotherapy ( `` experimental '' arm ) . The total number participant plan 162 ( randomize 1:1 ) . At randomisation follow factor control : serum albumin level , platinum sensitivity ( determine first-line therapy ) locally advanced v metastatic disease . The primary end point overall survival . Quality life economic evaluation assess impact patient relative cost effectiveness intervention . Archival paraffin-embedded tissue collect baseline prospective blood sample ( whole blood , serum plasma ) collect translational research .</detailed_description>
