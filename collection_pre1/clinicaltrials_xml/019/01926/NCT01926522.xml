	<brief_title>Technological Rehabilitation Distal Sensorimotor Polyneuropathy Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study witness physical exercise may interrupt devastate decrease muscle performance DSP experiment underway find exercises recovery motor function impairment . In fact rehabilitation treatment , aim reduce motor disability , preserve gait function prevent fall risk , interest therapeutic approach . Literature recommend balance re-training exercise , muscle strengthening , selective stretch retrain motor activity . New technology produce recent decade different device use strengthen exercise ( electromechanical dynamometer ) , balance recovery ( balance platform ) gait ( analyze treadmill ) visual feedback patient may independently monitor accuracy intensity exercise , therefore strongly motivate result high training intensity . These technology often use rehabilitation different patient , rarely employ DSP . The purpose case control study examine effectiveness application analyse treadmill , muscle strengthen balance training compare control intervention patient diabetic neuropathy .</detailed_description>
