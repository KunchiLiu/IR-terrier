	<brief_title>A Phase 2a , Proof-of-Concept Study GIC-1001 Management Visceral Pain During Sedation-Free , Full Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Study Objectives 1.1 Primary objective : The primary objective Phase IIa study establish clinical Proof-of-Concept ( POC ) provide clinically statistically significant evidence GIC-1001 safe effective manage visceral pain male female patient undergo sedation-free , full colonoscopy preventive purpose . 1.2 Secondary objective : Secondary objective include selection optimal dose GIC-1001 safety/efficacy ratio point view , establish preliminary safety profile drug patient , obtain preliminary general efficacy profile GIC-1001 assess various secondary endpoint 2 . Study Endpoints 2.1 Primary endpoint : Visceral pain assess use 100-mm VAS , measure various time anatomical segment ( N : 8 ) throughout colon , i.e . : 1 . Prior intra-rectal insertion endoscope ; 2 . After insertion anus ; 3 . After passage rectosigmoid segment ; 4 . Immediately passage splenic flexure ; 5 . Immediately passage hepatic flexure ; 6 . Once caecum reach ; 7 . Immediately passage splenic flexure scope withdrawal ; 8 . At end procedure , colonoscope completely remove . Any additional episode pain experienced patient also assess use 100-mm VAS scale . The area curve ( AUC ) calculate serial measurement make used statistical purpose , length insert colonoscope determine VAS measurement 's location . 2.2 Secondary endpoint : 1 . Overall pain perception ( 100-mm VAS ) end procedure ; 2 . Time reach caecum endoscope ( intubation time rectum caecum define time-to-caecum ) ; 3 . Total examination time , define time introduction removal colonoscope ; 4 . Percentage complete procedure ; 5 . Endoscopist 's perception adequacy analgesia , difficulty insertion , amount colonic spasm insertion withdrawal ( five-point Likert scale ) ; 6 . Use rescue sedation ( i.e . midazolam midazolam follow fentanyl ) 7 . Safety assess incidence treatment emergent adverse effect procedure 30 day ; 8 . Plasma determination trimebutine N-desmethyl-trimebutine moiety GIC-1001 plasmatic steady state ; 9 . Patient satisfaction treatment ( five-point Likert scale ) ; 10 . Patient ' willingness repeat colonoscopy future ( five-point Likert scale ) ; 11 . Safety GIC-1001 . 3 . Study Design This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel design 4-treatment arm study . Eligible patient randomize 1:1:1:2 ratio one 4 treatment arm : low ( 250 mg ) , mid ( 375 mg ) high ( 500 mg ) dose GIC-1001 , match placebo . All potential study subject screen assessed eligibility within maximum two ( 2 ) week prior randomization . Bowel preparation perform use polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) base regimen night actual procedure . 4 . Number Clinical Sites : This trial conduct Canada USA . Up ten ( 10 ) clinical site participate trial . The lead Investigator trial Dr Mark V. Larson MD , Head Digestive Endoscopy , Mayo Clinic , Rochester MN , USA 5 . Study population sample size : Approximately 240 patient randomize study . Male female patient indication full colonoscopy , mainly colorectal cancer screen surveillance . Only naïve subject , i.e . never underwent colonoscopy , eligible . 6 . Inclusion Criteria See Eligibility Section 7 . Exclusion Criteria See Eligibility Section 8 . Study Drugs Administration Schedule : GIC-1001 , match placebo administer follow : 1 . One tablet TID empty stomach three ( 3 ) consecutive day prior colonoscopy . 2 . Last dose take clinical site least one ( 1 ) hour prior begin procedure ( endoscope insertion ) . 3 . Bowel preparation perform use PEG base regimen day actual procedure . 4 . Three ( 3 ) different GIC-1001 dose level study : - 250 mg TID - 375 mg TID - 500 mg TID - Matching placebo TID 9 . Concomitant Medications 9.1 Prior colonoscopy , follow medication permit : Aspirin ( ASA ) low level cardiovascular health , dose regimen stable last 6 month prior colonoscopy . 9.2 The following medication food prohibit : - Any prescription chronic analgesic narcotic , anti-spasmodic , anti-inflammatory medication forbid 30 day prior screen . ( i.e . Washout ≥ 30 day ) - Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors ( SSRIs ) forbid 30 day prior screen , unless patient stable dose 3 consecutive month prior screen . - Over-the-counter analgesic , anti-inflammatory medication , oral topical use acute pain treatment must wash ≥ 7days prior screening . - Acute need prescription non-prescription anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic treatment within one ( 1 ) week prior colonoscopy . - Use bowel stimulant laxative , bisacodyl , within one ( 1 ) week precede randomization . - Use antidiarrheic medication , diphenoxylate , loperamide , kaopectate bismuth salt , within one ( 1 ) week precede randomization . - Administration barium enema within two ( 2 ) week precede randomization . - Colonic irritant beverage food , caffeine-containing beverage ( e.g . coffee , Coca-Cola ) , spice , well food contain seed ( i.e . tomato , strawberry , kiwi , raspberry ) within 24 hour precede colonoscopy . - Use investigational drug prohibit unless discontinue , within least 30 day prior randomization . - Additionally , Prior Concomitant Medications record CRF start 30 day prior Screening Visit CLV1 . 10 . Efficacy Evaluation : Colonic analgesic clinical efficacy GIC-1001 measure use continuous , horizontal 100-mm VAS , pre-determined time colonic anatomical segment . At least 8 measurement do participate patient ( see Primary Endpoint section ) . Subjects receive proper instruction use VAS prior colonoscopy . Overall experience visceral pain ( ) evaluate use AUC construct calculated VAS self-measurements patient . Additional , secondary , efficacy endpoint also measure , include time-to-caecum , colonoscopy completion rate antispasmodic activity . 11 . Safety Evaluation : Safety assess use performance physical exam , ECG , various laboratory safety test occurrence adverse event . AEs map MedDRA , version 16 . 12 . Sample Size Considerations : It report medical literature MCID range 10-15 mm 100-mm VAS clinical significant evaluation colonoscopy-related visceral pain . Using value , alpha 0.05 beta 0.9 , 50 patient would need active arm consider 90-patient placebo arm . Total study sample size estimate approximately 240 randomized patient . 13 . Statistical Analysis : The primary outcome measure mean 100-mm VAS AUC treatment arm .</detailed_description>
