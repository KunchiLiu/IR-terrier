	<brief_title>Rapalogues Autism Phenotype TSC : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This feasibility safety study primarily design assess feasibility safety conduct large clinical trial sirolimus individual TSC . The present study employ ABA design three pediatric participant select receive baseline medical , developmental , behavioral , cognitive evaluation , follow 26 week administration sirolimus , repeat baseline assessment end 26 week treatment phase , 4 week titrate withdrawal follow 22 week period rapalogue administer . All participant administer baseline medical , behavioral , cognitive evaluation end study order compare evaluation do baseline , end 26 week treatment , completion study . These comparison do assess secondary outcome include reduction autistic symptom , self-injury , aggression , well improvement cognitive function across multiple domain . Furthermore , administration secondary outcome measure also allow u good understand sensitivity measure patient TSC course clinical trial . Families potentially eligible child express interest study meet prescreening criterion invite attend screen visit determine eligibility , inclusion/exclusion criterion , availability eight additional study visit . Prior enrollment , informed consent obtain parent legal guardian . Investigators use method analysis single-subject research ( ABA design , first A represent baseline , B represent treatment , A represent reversal treatment . The analysis focus 3 subject separately . Data feasibility safety ( primary outcome ) frequency disruptive behavior ( secondary outcome ) plot visually inspect detect temporal change phase : 1 . Baseline , 2 . Treatment , 3 . After treatment . Data phase summarize mean +/- standard deviation ( SD ) . We use summary data assess potential effect intervention . Consistency effect examine across 3 study participant .</detailed_description>
