	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficacy Accuracy Aquamantys Device General Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study assess efficacy placement accuracy Aquamantys device 20 patient require general surgery . High frequency electrosurgery application frequency range 300 kHz several MHz order coagulate destroy tissue . Due technological advancement , knowledge frequency physical mode interact biological material become increasingly important order surgeon provide safe consistent surgery . The Aquamantys system utilizes radiofrequency energy saline irrigation cut tissue stop excessive bleeding . The Aquamantys system feature follow : 1 . Cone-shaped electrode design aid blunt dissection ; 2 . Large bipolar electrode configuration allow hemostatic sealing across broad plane tissue ; 3 . Bipolar electrodes alleviate need ground pad ; 4 . Transcollation technology allow control depth energy penetration . During surgery , Aquamantys device utilize order stop excessive bleed cut vessel . The patient monitor surgeon research nurse coordinator surgery , intra-operatively post-operatively discharge hospital . The study participant follow-up post-operatively surgeon per standard care .</detailed_description>
