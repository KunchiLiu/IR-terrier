	<brief_summary>The participant study men &amp; woman ≥50 year deem 10-30 % risk develop CVD next 10 year . Their risk calculate use Joint British Societies 2 ( JBS2 ) guideline prevention CVD clinical practise algorithm . This take account participant age , sex , cholesterol value , blood pressure , family history ethnicity ( SE Asian ) . The participant randomly assign one two group aid computer program call `` minim '' use age , sex , BMI smoking status determine broccoli participant consume intervention . Each participant consume 4 x 100g assigned broccoli , week 12 week top normal diet . They allow eat broccoli whenever want week , ask note eat . A steamer provide participant cook broccoli require 4-5 minute . Participants ask keep two diet diary time intervention , one start intervention one towards end . Blood sample urine also collect , pre post intervention , analysis biomarkers CVD . This joint project base two site , Institute Food ( IFR ) Research Norwich University Reading ( UoR ) , Reading . Samples participant site analyse IFR , UoR company United States .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Broccoli Vascular Health Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This intervention take place two independent site , The Institute Food Research 's Human Nutrition Unit ( HNU ) Norwich Hugh Sinclair Human Nutrition Unit ( HSU ) , University Reading . The participant recruit Norwich Reading solely attend unit area paper work write reflect i.e.separate participant information sheet ( PIS ) . In addition test carry site , Reading cohort also undergo additional vascular test , also reflect PIS . Despite site independent , 96 participant recruit across site , possibility uneven number site make final number . The purpose study ass whether diet affect individual chance develop CVD , one big killer UK . We particularly interested participant 10 % -30 % risk develop CVD . We able assess person 's risk help Joint British Societies 2 guideline prevention cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular disease risk prediction chart . These chart take number parameter obtain participant , age , sex , total cholesterol concentration , systolic blood pressure ( BP ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , serum high density lipoprotein concentration , smoke status diabetes status put algorithm . The result risk score 100 , person develop CVD next 10 year . The study conduct two site , Reading Norwich , principal investigator assign site . The total number participant recruit site 96 . It may uneven number recruit two site e.g . 46 one 50 another however regardless number site , 48 participant assign two group . One group consume 400g commercially available high glucosinolate Beneforté® broccoli week 12 week consume 400g standard broccoli , Parthenon 12 week . As assess effect diet CVD risk , participant screen initially . Their urine test ( urine dipstick test ) , height , weight , waist hip measurement , BMI , BP measure question link lifestyle choice ( alcohol consumption , smoke status physical activity ) ask . A separate section pertain woman 's health also present questionnaire . All participant ask give write informed consent participate intervention study . The Reading cohort send copy consent medical declaration form read home . The form send home clearly distinguishable real form watermark `` SAMPLE '' write across . CVD risk assessment calculator This calculator use result screen know . A program devise University Manchester use calculate risk participant develop CVD next 10 year . This program base Joint British Societies 2 guideline prevention CVD risk prediction chart . For purpose study would like participant fall 10 % -30 % risk category literature suggest people range may benefit dietary change , without need medication , part . The CVD risk score send participant GP continue advise participant discuss result GPs score &gt; 10 % . Genotyping There evidence suggest person 's genetic make-up may affect way isothiocyanate ( ITCs ) , one active component broccoli , work . Of 30,000 gene find human group gene associate protein glutathione S-transferase M1 ( GSTM1 ) show affect ITCs consumption implicate CVD . There evidence suggest individual deletion GSTM1 breakdown glucosinolate , ITC sulforaphane derive , differently individual gene . We also know glutathione S-transferase theta-1 ( GSTT1 ) may also involve reduce likelihood develop CVD . Along GST gene family association cruciferous vegetable , number gene implicate CVD . These include gene associate lipid metabolism , thrombosis , leukocyte adhesion nitric oxide production thus blood vessel dilation . This mean exhaustive list therefore remain open viable candidate . Vascular measurement As age , artery stiffen cause increase demand heart increase blood pressure . This increase BP dramatically increase risk heart attack , stroke heart failure . Arterial stiffness also associate many common risk factor associate CVD age , high blood pressure , smoking , cholesterol level obesity , importantly , arterial stiffness show independent predictor CVD large section society . There many way arterial stiffness assess . We look blood pressure , familiar participant age range ( 50yrs age ) . The difference participant wear cuff hour reading collect every ten minute . Another method Pulse Wave Analysis ( PWA ) , probe hold neck upper thigh take measurement minute time . As participant may wholly familiar technique , hop short video clip could show laptop diagrams/photographs technique discuss participant screening . Restricted condition prior study day Before study day participant ask abstain number activity . This clearly state PIS . These include : 1 . No alcohol caffeine 24 hour study day . Participants consume lot caffeine advise may suffer headache . They ask tell study scientist need take medication consequence . 2 . Low fat meal consume night study day . Participants ask eat low fat meal select list give . We ask meal consume 10pm , participant fast study day . 3 . Fasting least 8 hour . Participants need fast least 8 hour . This mean wo n't able eat drink anything , apart water time . They drink much water feel need . 4 . No heavy exercise morning study day . Participants ask engage vigorous exercise morning study day . This defined activity cause increase heart rate , pant and/or sweat . A participant normally cycle ask morning study day . 5 . No smoke hour study day measurement . All participant smoke ask abstain smoking least hour study day . We would also ask avoid passive smoking .</detailed_description>
