	<brief_summary>This open-label study INCB047986 give two distinct group patient ( Group 1 Group 2 ) advance malignancy . The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics INCB047986 determine maximum tolerate dose INCB047986 combination gemcitabine nab paclitaxel select group patient solid tumor . Each patient group participate phase study divide two part . The patient group enrol sequential manner start Patient Group 1 . Patient Group 1 Group 1 comprise patient advanced malignancy receive INCB047986 monotherapy . Part 1 : Dose Escalation Phase - This phase evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics ( PK ) INCB047986 give describe patient advanced malignancy . A goal Part 1 identify maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) INCB047986 and/or dose ( ) tolerate dos produce substantial pharmacologic effect . These dos use Part 2 study . Part 2 : Expansion Phase - This phase explore safety , tolerability , PK , preliminary clinical activity INCB047986 use dos identify Part 1 . Group 2 Group 2 subject advance metastatic pancreatic cancer , breast cancer urothelial cancer . Part 1 : Dose Optimization Phase - This phase identify MTD INCB047986 combination gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel patient advance metastatic solid tumor . Specifically , patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( first second line ) , triple-negative breast cancer ( second line ) urothelial cancer ( second line ) . Part 2 : Expansion Phase - This phase explore safety , tolerability , PK , biomarkers , preliminary clinical activity dose regimen ( ) identify Part 1 . Patients enrol phase limit advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
