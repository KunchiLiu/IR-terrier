	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Use Prophylactic Antibiotics EUS-guided Pancreatic Cyst Aspiration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With increase use cross sectional imaging , appear increase prevalence pancreatic cyst incidentally discover . A critical step workup pancreas cyst determine whether cyst mucinous non-mucinous , procedure call endoscopic ultrasound - fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) . Current guideline suggest use antibiotic cyst aspiration , usually 3 day procedure . However , recommendation base limited data 15 year ago . More recent retrospective observation suggest equivalent safety little , even antibiotic give .</detailed_description>
