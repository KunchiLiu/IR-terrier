	<brief_summary>Long-term survival patient pancreatic carcinoma low , even follow resection , 5-year survival rate patient range 10 25 % 1 . Most treatment failure due local recurrence , distant metastasis within one two year surgery2-4 . Surgery suggest accelerate development preexist micro metastasis promote establishment new metastases5 . Release catecholamine proinflammatory product secondary surgical stress believe promote cancer progression6 . Maintenance proper anesthetic depth beneficial attenuate surgical stress . However , general anesthesia include numerous induction agent , volatile anesthetic opioids , associate immunosuppression especially cell-mediated immunity crucial role prevention micrometastasis5,7 . Therefore , regional anesthesia analgesia effectively attenuate surgical stress efficiently reduce general anesthetic consumption , seem provide promising advantage prevent perioperative cancer progression . Currently , study available human retrospective observational evaluate regional anesthesia prostate , colorectal , breast cervical cancer-related outcomes8-12 . Only one randomize study investigate major abdominal cancer surgery available13 . However , specific individual cancer type perioperative cell-mediated immunity evaluate . In study , aim identify whether epidural block beneficial early surgical late cancer-related outcome patient receive pancreatic cancer surgery . Perioperative cell-mediated immunity function include natural killer cell , helper cytotoxic T-lymphocytes also investigate .</brief_summary>
