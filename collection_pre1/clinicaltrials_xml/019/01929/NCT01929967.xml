	<brief_summary>The investigator aim study investigate mechanism immune deficiency patient heterotaxy syndrome use novel biomarkers prospective questionnaire survey document burden infectious sequela follow enrollment . It known patient under-active spleen ( functional asplenia hyposplenia ) secondary ( non-cardiac ) condition Sickle Cell Disease Inflammatory Bowel Disease characteristic paucity B cell sub-class know IgM memory B cell . This specific sub-class B cell normally mature spleen improperly function spleen significant deficiency B cell class see flow cytometry . Similarly , patient note increased amount 'junk ' DNA / nuclear remnant red cell . This see microscopy dark particle inside red cell term Howell Jolly Body ( normally less 2 % red cell dark particle present ) . Part function spleen 's normal task rid blood red cell contain nuclear remnant under-active spleen get behind task build-up Howell Jolly Bodies red cell present bloodstream . Flow cytometry quickly accurately quantify Howell Jolly Bodies well IgM memory B cell small ( ~1.5cc ) sample blood . Normal IgM memory B cell range know healthy child infancy onwards allow interpretation result normative data range . The investigator aim enroll 10 patient pilot study diagnosis heterotaxy syndrome ( asplenia polysplenia ) prospectively follow obtain initial biomarker sample . The family contact every two week period 12 week ask series simple question take approximately 5 minute recent infectious sequela symptom . The question elucidate history minor illness low-grade fever cough significant event admission in-patient antibiotic therapy bacterial sepsis . Ultimately , pilot study , investigator hope obtain sufficient data support funding application large , multi-center trial allow u develop biomarker threshold future risk sepsis .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis heterotaxy syndrome , objectively defined visceral heterotaxy ( malrotation , interrupt inferior vena cava ) either document polysplenia asplenia radiological imaging . 012 year old . Other known immunodeficiency hyposplenic state ( 22q11 , hypogammaglobulinemia , sickle hemoglobinopathy , liver cirrhosis portal hypertension , organ transplantation , Fanconi syndrome , HIV AIDS , chronic corticosteroid use , cancer , chemotherapy immunomodulating drug exposure , Addison 's disease panhypopituitarism , surgical splenectomy ) . Red blood cell transfusion within last 90 day donate red blood cell may interfere calculation subject 's Howell Jolly Body count . Patient enrollment defer 90 day elapse , assume eligibility requirement meet .</criteria>
