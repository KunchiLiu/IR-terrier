	<detailed_description>Cocaine dependence among tenacious substance use disorder yet remain one lacking effective pharmacological intervention . As pharmacologic approach fruitful , new target require . A novel treatment approach disrupt neural process involve cue-related memory ( memory link external stimulus associate drug use subjective drug effect ) . These engrained memory , reactivate cue , elicit crave return drug use . Each cue re-exposure , however , require re-remembering ( reconsolidation ) drug cue . Key molecular process require memory reconsolidation NMDA ( N-methyl-D-aspartate ) receptor activation , induction nitric oxide ( NO ) synthesis increase extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) activity . In rodent model , block process change cue-related memory ; cue lose potency induce return drug self-administration . Lidocaine FDA approve medication inhibits activation NMDA receptor suppress production NO ERK . Lidocaine , like cocaine , local anesthetic potent effect sodium-channel blocker . Unlike cocaine , lidocaine essentially devoid activity monoamine re-uptake transporter reward addictive property . As lidocaine suppresses molecular process require drug cue reconsolidation relatively specific effect upon striatal region necessary drug cue reconsolidation , lidocaine may offer novel approach interfere memory reconsolidation . Two Na+ channel blocker also decrease crave and/or substance use substance-dependent subject . We propose systemic administration lidocaine follow induction cue-induced craving , relative saline plus cue-induced craving lidocaine without cue-induced craving , block reconsolidation cue memory . This lead reduction cue-induced craving upon repeat test well subsequent cocaine use basal crave . If hypothesis prove correct , finding 1 ) support role lidocaine cocaine addiction treatment , 2 ) demonstrate feasibility efficacy attenuate cue-induced memory , 3 ) guide development large study lidocaine .</detailed_description>
