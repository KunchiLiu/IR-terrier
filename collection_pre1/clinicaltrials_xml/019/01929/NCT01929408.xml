	<brief_title>Feasibility Outcomes Allogeneic HCT Compared Chemotherapy Older AML Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective multicenter observational study Consortium collaborating institution investigate often old medically infirm patient diagnose Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) treat induction chemotherapy undergo allogeneic HCT . Investigators look rate undergoing allogeneic HCT among old medically infirm AML high-risk MDS patient compare younger relatively healthy patient . Investigators also compare characteristic outcomes patient versus proceed allogeneic HCT . A number outcome assess include mortality , morbidity , quality life ( QOL ) . Baseline information collect different domain QOL , geriatric assessment , health status measure , AML feature , socioeconomic status . Information help physicians patient decide best treatment choice AML high-risk MDS older medically infirm patient .</detailed_description>
