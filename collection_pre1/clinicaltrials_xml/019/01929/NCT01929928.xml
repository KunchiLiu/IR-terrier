	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficacy Accuracy Cordless Ultrasonic Dissection System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Sonicision device offer ability achieve hemostasis vessel dissection cordless system . The ultrasonic device yield coagulation transection vessel conversion electrical energy ultrasonic vibration piezoelectric magnetic transducer , causation heat induction jaw instrument friction . The Sonicision device able seal vessel 5 mm transection division 10 cm segment . The Sonicision device feature follow : 1 . Cordless design improve freedom movement ; 2 . Simplified set may possibly increase operating room efficiency ; 3 . Dual-mode energy control increase procedure focus ; 4 . Improved mobility secondary cordless system . Currently device connect generator cable , lead cable wrap around device , tangle instrument become inadvertently contaminate . There several advantage regard utilization cordless device include : improved intra-operative storage , avoidance bundle multiple cord various instrument may limit instrument mobility portability may lead ability operate advance surgical equipment third world setting , trauma surgery center . The study group consist 150 patient , male female adult , present need general surgery ultrasonic dissection device and/or vessel seal device utilized . Patients identify prospectively via consultation general surgeon . Data collect address follow variable : versatility , dissection time , vessel diameter , reliability , efficiency , tissue response , steam production , blood loss , tissue response , thermal spread , desiccation sealing time . A tentative total ten individual tissue specimen obtain surgeon surgery utilization Sonicision Cordless Ultrasonic Dissection System . The patient 's histologic sample follow surgery order determine efficacy vessel seal . Subsequently , patient 's information deidentified patient assign study number analysis tie . Patient participation include time surgery discharge hospital . Study data collect manage utilizing electronic database .</detailed_description>
