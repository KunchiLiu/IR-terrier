	<brief_summary>Objectives : To demonstrate duration antidepressant effect Low Field Magnetic Stimulation ( LFMS ) subject bipolar depression . Hypotheses : Investigators expect subject receive LFMS show significant mood improvement one week start three day course daily stimulation compare subject receive sham LFMS . Investigators expect subject receive LFMS show immediate mood improvement first treatment measure difference pre post-treatment PANAS+ rating . Investigators expect show LFMS well tolerate three-treatment protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Treatment Study Using Low Field Magnetic Stimulation Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low Field Magnetic Stimulation electromagnetic intervention investigate McLean Hospital effect symptom depression . It consist pulse electric field induce remotely head portable coil . It observe mood elevate effect depressed patient Bipolar Disorder ( BPD ) . These effect immediate , occur upon completion 20 minute treatment . LFMS unique low electric field strength , high frequency operation , compare electromagnetic treatment . While treatment Electroconvulsive Therapy ( ECT ) use electric field equivalent &gt; 100-200 Volts/meter affect brain , LFMS use &lt; 1 V/m . Such low electric field strength indicate another mechanism activate LFMS , provide possibility new treatment . It may also give insight cause depression . LFMS also unique immediate effect . This immediate effect may implications emergency treatment . The purpose study observe response LFMS depress BPD subject aim assess effect multiple treatment , observe duration mood improvement.To , investigator propose study 72 subject protocol three treatment three day . Subjects rat treatment , return mood rating one week treatment . Investigators hope characterization LFMS allow clinical research group perform large trial evaluate clinical effectiveness patient population .</detailed_description>
