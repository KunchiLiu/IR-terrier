	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , control , parallel group Phase 1/2 assessment safety GINTUIT versus Bio-Gide subject posterior tooth require extraction . The incidence severity adverse event summarize group ( GINTUIT Bio-Gide ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Gintuitâ„¢ Subjects Requiring Socket Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety GINTUIT compare Bio-Gide subject posterior tooth require extraction . The use GINTUIT investigational clinical indication may eliminate/reduce need aggressive flap advancement concomitant morbidity , , time , obtain stable closure graft socket . It anticipate GINTUIT facilitate tissue granulation , follow tissue coverage site appropriate tissue ( ie , keratinize tissue ) need long term stability final restoration .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject least 18 year age 75 year age . Subject posterior ( molar premolar ) socket create atraumatic extraction post extraction socket minimum 5 mm mesialdistal ( MD ) buccallingual ( BL ) dimension require bone grafting . Subject sufficient buccal bone plate site plan tooth extraction ( ie , residual socket form would retain bone graft material ) , judge Principal Investigator . Females childbearing potential must document negative urine pregnancy test . All subject must agree use acceptable method contraception duration study . Subjects must read , understood , sign institutional review board ( IRB ) approve Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . Subjects must able willing comply protocol requirement . Subject systemic condition could compromise wound heal preclude periodontal surgery ( ie , bleed disorder , cancer , except localize basal cell squamous cell cancer skin metastasis ; human immunodeficiency virus ; bone metabolic disease [ ie , osteoporosis Paget 's disease ] ) . Subject currently receive , anticipate receive receive within 30 day prior Day 0 : inhale systemic corticosteroid ( ie , oral , IV ) , immunosuppressive agent radiation therapy , and/or chemotherapy , could compromise wound heal preclude periodontal surgery . Subject oral/periodontal surgery within 30 day prior Day 0 anticipates oral/periodontal surgery within 30 day Day 0 . Subject acute mucosal infection , include suppuration induration area intend surgery . Subject , opinion Principal Investigator , require sinus lift procedure place dental implant surgical area . Subject without least 1 tooth adjacent area treat . Subject history alcohol substance abuse within previous 12 month Screening could interfere study compliance protocol requirement . Subject use tobacco product within 6 month Screening . Subject know hypersensitivity porcine bovine collagen , gentamicin surfactant . Subject receive investigational drug , device , biological/bioactive treatment within 30 day prior Day 0 ( medical dental ) . Subject previously treat Gintuit , cell therapy target treatment site immediately adjacent teeth . Female subject lactating . Subject , opinion Principal Investigator , reason list , able complete study per protocol .</criteria>
