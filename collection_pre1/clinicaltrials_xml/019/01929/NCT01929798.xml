	<brief_summary>The purpose trial ass performance Artificial Pancreas ( AP ) device use Portable Artificial Pancreas System ( pAPS ) platform subject type 1 diabetes use insulin pump rapid acting insulin . This propose study design compare closed-loop control without optimization initialization parameter relate basal insulin infusion rate insulin carbohydrate ( I : C ) ratios meal snack .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crossover Feasibility Study Portable AP Device With Zone-MPC HMS Adapted I : C Basal Insulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist evaluation Artificial Pancreas device system two 24-27.5-hour closed-loop phase outpatient/hotel environment . Prior closed-loop phase , subject undergo 7-day data collection period consist usual free-living condition along 3 meal know carbohydrate content . Data insulin pump , continuous glucose monitoring sensor ( CGM ) , diet exercise record collect period . These data 7-day period analyze order come adapt basal insulin infusion rate bolus insulin carbohydrate ( I : C ) ratio .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes least one year use insulin pump least 6 month commercially available rapid act insulin The diagnosis type 1 diabetes base investigator 's judgment ; C peptide level antibody determination need . Age 21 65 year For female , currently know pregnant nursing HbA1c â‰¤ 10 % , measure DCA2000 equivalent device Willing perform calibration study CGMs use finger stick willing follow instruction insulin pump CGM wear . Willing use study CGM study insulin pump closedloop . Able agrees avoid follow medication start 24 hour sensor wear completion close loop study visit : acetaminophen , prednisone , pseudoephedrine . An understanding willingness follow protocol sign inform consent . Pregnancy ( determine positive blood pregnancy test perform female childbearing capacity screen visit urine test time admission inpatient visit ) nursing mother . Females sexually active able conceive use contraception . Any document arrhythmia . Diabetic ketoacidosis past 6 month prior enrollment require emergency room visit hospitalization Severe hypoglycemia result seizure loss consciousness 12 month prior enrollment Current treatment seizure disorder ; Subjects history seizure may include study receive write clearance neurologist Active infection A known medical condition judgment investigator might interfere completion protocol cognitive deficit . Mental incapacity , unwillingness language barrier preclude adequate understanding cooperation , include subject able read write . Coronary artery disease heart failure . Subjects history coronary artery disease may include study receive write clearance cardiologist Presence know adrenal disorder Active gastroparesis If antihypertensive , thyroid , antidepressant lipid lower medication , lack stability medication past 2 month prior enrollment study Uncontrolled thyroid disease . Adequately treated thyroid disease celiac disease exclude subject enrollment Abuse alcohol A recent injury body limb , muscular disorder , use medication , carcinogenic disease , significant medical disorder injury , medication disease judgment investigator affect completion exercise protocol Current use beta blocker medication Hematocrit &lt; 30 % &gt; 55 % A1C &gt; 10 % Abnormal liver renal function ( Transaminase &gt; 2 time upper limit normal , Creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ) Labs drawn screen visit within one month prior screen ( purpose ) suffice enrollment purpose related hematocrit Subject skin condition , determination investigator , would preclude wear study device ( infusion set sensor ) , abdomen . Examples include limited : psoriasis , burn , scar , eczema , tattoo , significant hypertrophy site device wear ; know allergy medical adhesive . Currently longterm treatment use prednisone . If subject short term treatment prednisone , defer enrollment underlying condition prednisone treatment resolve . Allergy study drug , food study material . Clinically significant screening ECG , physical examination , laboratory test , vital sign abnormality . Exposure investigational drug within 30 day . History malignancy within 5 year screen ( basal cell carcinoma ) . Currently smoke discontinue smoking ( include cigarette , cigar , pipe ) past 6 month . Highly sensitive insulin : insulintocarbohydrate ratio I : C &gt; 1:12 Current participation another investigational trial .</criteria>
