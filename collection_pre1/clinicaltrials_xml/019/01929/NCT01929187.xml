	<brief_summary>Background : Onychomycosis , common nail disorder , superficial fungal infection affect toenail fingernail . Onychomycosis cause pain discomfort potential source morbidity . Although oral antifungal agent achieve good complete cure rate onychomycosis , many patient worried side effect unwilling take oral medication . Phytonail mixture herbal active ingredient include tea tree oil , lavender oil Australian blue cypress oil BioEqual carrier system . A preliminary trial show 100 % KOH negative rate 32 nail 12 week Phytonail therapy . Amorolfine 5 % nail lacquer ( Loceryl ) broad-spectrum morpholine antifungal demonstrate 60-75 % mycological cure rate several randomize controlled trial treatment toenail onychomycosis . Objective : To evaluate efficacy safety Phytonail relative amorolfine 5 % nail lacquer treatment toenail onychomycosis . Methods : This randomize , parallel-group , open-labeled study adult subject toenail onychomycosis . In study , 60 eligible patient randomize 1 : 1 ratio one two treatment group : Phytonail amorolfine 5 % nail lacquer . Before randomization , patient onychomycosis least one great toenail positive KOH examination positive fungal culture . During treatment phase , Phytonail apply twice daily amorolfine 5 % nail lacquer weekly 16 week affect toenail . Physician 's assessment photographic analysis carry baseline , Week 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 . Mycological evaluation include KOH examination perform baseline , Week 4 , 8 , 16 . Fungal culture perform baseline KOH negative patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Evaluate Efficacy Herbal Ingredients Combined With Carrier System ( Phytonail ) Compared With Amorolfine 5 % Nail Lacquer ( Loceryl ) Treatment Toenail Onychomycosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects age 20-65 year toenail onychomychosis involve least one great toenail recruit study . Approximately 200 subject screen , order randomize 72 eligible subject . Allowing approximately 20 % drop-outs , estimate complete 60 eligible subject , approximately 72 subject would enrol . Subjects must meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion receive treatment assignment . Procedures : Explain study obtain write informed consent : Screening Review inclusion/exclusion criterion include prior concomitant medication : Screening Baseline ( Day 1 ) Demographics : Screening Medical history ( include prior onychomycosis ) : Screening Personal family history well history prior treatment onychomycosis symptom attribute onychomycosis Physical examination : Screening Selection target great toenail : Screening Proper nail trim target great toenail ( need ) : visit The subject 's target great toenail properly trim need investigator qualify designee . Proper nail trimming define cut nail plate within 1 mm hyponychium distal groove . In case onycholysis nail trim proximal limit onycholysis . Percentage nail involvement target great toenail base sign onychomycosis : visit The percentage involvement target great toenail determine investigator 's visual estimate extent total nail area show sign onychomycosis proper trim nail . Assessment toenail : visit ( except screen ) At baseline ( Day 1 ) subsequent visit , investigator identify toenail ( exclude target great toenail ) sign onychomycosis determine total number toenail completely clear ( 0 % involvement ) almost clear ( &lt; 10 % involvement ) . Marking target great toenail : visit The investigator ink distal groove , 2-mm notch ( except Screening , notch make yet ) , healthy/involved limit target toenail supply indelible marking pen . These marking target great toenail use determine CN , use calculation CNG LNG . The initial photo unmarked nail must take mark make . Two-millimeter notch target great toenail : Baseline ( Day 1 ) At Baseline ( Day 1 ) visit , investigator make superficial notch nail plate , approximately 2 mm distal proximal nail fold . The investigator ink notch mark pen subsequent visit . If , nail grows , investigator feel original notch may clip next visit , new nail notch approximately 2 mm proximal nail fold make . KOH examination target great toenail : Screening , Week 4 , 8 , 16 . Fungal culture target great toenail : Screening , Week 4 , 8 , 16 KOH negative patient Digital photography : Baseline ( Day 1 ) ; Week 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 ; early termination ( applicable ) Digital photograph analyze follow measurement : Clear nail ( CN ) target great toenail : CN define distance ( mm ) PNF proximal limit disease ( marked investigator ) . Clear nail growth ( CNG ) target great toenail : The CNG calculation define difference ( mm ) CN give visit CN Baseline ( Day 1 ) . For example , baseline CN 2 mm Week 12 CN 5 mm , nail 3 mm new clear nail growth . Linear nail growth ( LNG ) target great toenail : The LNG represent growth nail plate ( normal mycotic ) period time . LNG define distance give time point PNF nail notch , minus distance notch PNF Baseline ( 2 mm ) . For example , post-Baseline visit length proximal nail fold ink notch becomes 6 mm , nail growth 4 mm ( 6 mm- 2 mm= 4 mm ) . Randomization : Baseline ( Day 1 ) Subject dose diary dispensing : Baseline ( Day 1 ) Week 8 Subject dose diary collection : Week 4 Week 16 , early termination Study drug dispensing : Baseline ( Day 1 ) Week 8 Study drug self-administration : Baseline ( Day 1 ) Week 16 Study drug collection : Week 4 Week 16 , early termination Prior concomitant drug : All visit Record adverse event : All visit ( except screen )</detailed_description>
