	<brief_title>Regorafenib Assessment Refractory Advanced Colorectal Cancer ( RegARd-C )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective identify population patient bear advanced , refractory colorectal cancer , draw benefit treatment regorafenib . There specific hypothesis underlying sample size study therefore see exploratory . Secondary objective : - To analyze PFS response rate ( RR ) relationship covariates OS - To assess regorafenib efficacy ( OS , PFS , RR ) safety profile study population . - To assess Disease control rate ( DCR = Complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] ) - To compare relative benefit ( OS , PFS ) regorafenib accord history treatment bevacizumab .</detailed_description>
