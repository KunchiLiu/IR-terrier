A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include Investigator , consultation GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor require , judge document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Body weight &gt; = 50 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index within range 19 32 kg/square meter ( m2 ) ( inclusive ) . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use condom . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication 50 day post last dose . Willing able give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form full duration study , able understand follow instruction relate study procedure . Able swallow retain oral medication . Alanine aminotransferase , Aspartate aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; = 2.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Based single average correct QT interval ( QTc ) value triplicate ECGs obtain brief recording period : QT duration correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &lt; 450 millisecond . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : An average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit male . In Australia one unit ( =standard drink ) equivalent 10 gram alcohol : 270 milliliter ( mL ) full strength beer ( 4.8 % ) , 375 mL mid strength beer ( 3.5 % ) , 470 mL light beer ( 2.7 % ) , 250mL premix full strength spirit ( 5 % ) , 100 mL wine ( 13.5 % ) 30 mL spirit ( 40 % ) .

History : Breast cancer clinical breast examination find suggestive malignancy ; Malignancy within past five year , except basal cell carcinoma skin . Subjects prior malignancy evidence disease least past 5 year eligible . Prior medical history evidence prostate cancer ( e.g. , positive biopsy , suspicious ultrasound , suspicious digital rectal examination [ DRE ] ) . Patients suspicious ultrasound DRE negative biopsy within precede 6 month stable prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) eligible study .
