	<brief_summary>The investigator propose innovative new model care patient identify high risk hospitalization offer care physician direct care hospital clinic able see patient high risk hospitalization . This allow physician panel patient small enough provide continue ambulatory care sick enough physician enough patient hospitalized time justify physician spend several hour morning see patient hospital , make model economically viable clinically valuable patient . The investigator estimate 5 physician investigator propose establish model serve panel 200 patient steady state average 10 day expect hospitalization $ 75,000 Medicare spending per year , total $ 75 million annually . The investigator estimate 1 % reduction cost patient enough cover ongoing cost model investigator propose ; investigator ' program reorganize care rather add new form care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator ' project 5 aim : Aim 1 : To implement innovative Comprehensive Care Physician ( CCP ) Model multi-disciplinary team-based care University Chicago Medical Center ( UCMC ) care patient high risk hospitalization lead CCPs focus practice patient high risk hospitalization personally care patient clinic hospital , saving Medicare share AMC . As noted support theory data , key justification goal base value doctor-patient relationship . Building 15 year experience develop hospitalist program ( IRB protocol 9967 ) 2 30 clinician , investigator provide detailed plan efficiently implement investigator ' model improve care within 6 month . To incentivize assess cost-savings , investigator propose : Aim 2 : Among patient meet clinical eligibility criterion CCP model express willingness receive care model , assess utilization quality health care , health outcome , cost care patient randomly assign offer CCP care compare patient randomly assign offer CCP care . Evaluation important investigator ' project ensure investigator meet triple-aim assessment cost saving need implement share saving model investigator think important incentivize cost saving . The investigator recognize use randomization ass out-comes basis long-term payment model Medicare select approach evaluation investigator think provide accurate estimate effect program . Assuming capitated payment Accountable Care Organizations ( ACOs ) become major payment approach Medicare , cost saving CCPs would create sustainable incentive use . CCPs might also work well ACOs selection high risk patient CCP program might concern patient come within ACO 's covered population . Sustained incentive use CCPs could also exist high-risk person select ACOs CCPs , risk adjustment adequate . Shared saving program adequate risk adjustment would produce similar incentive . To address dissemination risk adjustment , investigator propose : Aim 3 : To use data collect UHC 4 Chicago-area AMCs link Medicare data support evaluation potential local national dissemination CCP model UHC ( previously University HealthSystem Consortium ) include 100 AMCs nation-wide exceptional data hospital resource use support risk-adjustment . UHC also house laboratory Medicare data enhance risk-adjustment outcome assessment . The investigator use data inform potential local dissemination test model help participate Chicago-area AMCs identify segment patient population frequently admit enough suitable CCP model . If model successful UCMC , perhaps later local dissemination evaluation , UHC 's national scope create opportunity dissemination investigator ' work almost US AMCs . The risk-adjustment data also allow u evaluate alternative strategy assess program saving estimate share saving require randomization . Thus investigator propose : Aim 4 : To compare result obtain Aim 2 three alternative assessment strategy : 1 ) compare patient UCMC treat CCP model patient UCMC meet CCP clinical eligibility criterion receive usual care , 2 ) compare patient UCMC meet CCP clinical eligibility criterion historical patient UCMC meet CCP clinical eligibility criterion , 3 ) compare patient UCMC eligible CCP model current patient 4 Chicago-area AMCs meet CCP clinical eligibility criterion . The investigator propose evaluate alternative approach selection control group investigator think might feasible approach estimate saving shared-savings model differ potential threat validity ( e.g. , 1 must address patient selection intervention 2 must address time trend cost ) , outcomes assessment ( patient outcome harder assess 2 3 ) , generalizability ( 1 require local patient treat outside model 2 require historical data , become less relevant time ) . All model adjust CMS-Hierarchical Condition Category ( HCC ) risk adjustment model base analysis investigator also explore approach risk adjustment , use prior year total Medicare expenditures patient-reported variable risk adjuster . The investigator propose use randomize control group share saving incentive , work CMMI cooperative agreement ass control group approach risk adjustment could use share saving incentive . Patient-reported outcome assess enrolled subject . Finally , since workforce development key implement disseminate model , investigator propose : Aim 5 : To develop skill multidisciplinary team provider execute CCP model , expose medical student , resident fellow , health profession trainees model . Because investigator AMC rich pipeline health profession trainees excellent record training national leader , investigator excellently situate train clinician investigator ' model potential help disseminate core principle locally nationally .</detailed_description>
