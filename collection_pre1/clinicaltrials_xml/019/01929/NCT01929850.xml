	<detailed_description>Obesity costly multi-etiology world disease fat storage . Morbid obesity define great 100 pound overweight and/or great 200 % ideal body weight . A commonly used measure body mass Body Mass Index , BMI , weight kilogram divide body surface area meter square ( kg/m² ) . A BMI great equal 40 define morbid obesity . Morbid obesity associate extraordinarily high increase risk mortality principally cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . Morbidly obese patient routinely develop early hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus . Currently , estimate approximately 15 % adult U.S. population morbidly obese . Morbid obesity certainly solely disease economically advantage . In developed country calorie readily available relatively inexpensive , morbid obesity disproportionately note culturally economically disadvantaged people . Most disturbing , morbid obesity especially prevalent among low socioeconomic woman age 21-40 year , woman bear rear child . Morbid obesity patient population clearly associate `` Metabolic Syndrome '' include document medical condition diabetes , hypertension , sleep apnea , hypercholesterolemia ultimately early onset heart disease chronic lung disease . In addition , chronic underemployment , poor housing , child abuse , limited education , stress anxiety associate maternal morbid obesity . These latter condition leave many patient state economic , social emotional poverty need life-long welfare support . The impact next generation rear morbidly obese underserved minority patient likely dire . Currently major treatment program available morbid obesity include supervise dietary program , pre-planned meal , positive reinforcement , even pharmacological therapy costly low permanent success rate . For patient true morbid obesity standard surgical procedure currently procedure choice especially among patient fail standard medical intervention . One best know international program Weight Watchers International . Recent study document weight loss great equal 5 kg 12 month period . Weight Watchers international company base United States offer various product service assist weight loss maintenance . It found 1963 operate 30 country world-wide . The Weight Watcher 's philosophy use science-driven approach help participant lose weight form helpful habit , eat smarter , get exercise provide support . Weight Watchers use PointPlus System . This system calculation base dietary protein , carbohydrate , fat fiber . The weekly program focus assist member create caloric deficit lose weight . The Weight Watchers Program design result weight loss ½ 2 pound per week . Members Weight Watchers expect go hourly weekly meeting select topic discussion `` weigh-in '' . Membership Weight Watchers Program include weekly meeting , also access Weight Watchers online , access Weight Watchers eTools access Weight Watchers mobile application . Weekly Meeting Process : For half hour prior start-times , participant weighs . Weight record computer track participant 's progress . The topic week announce ( i.e . The Sleep-Weight Loss Connection ) . The weekly topic discuss amongst member moderator ( Weight Watchers lifetime member ) focus relationship topic weight loss . All encourage verbally participate requirement . The moderator reward member reach certain goal . Members also discuss progress throughout past week . At end meeting , moderator enforces adoption life-style change incorporate topic week daily life . Members never pressure buy informational product , decide . The major procedure perform morbid obesity include Roux-en-Y gastric bypass , sleeve gastrectomy laparoscopic band procedure . The sleeve gastrectomy permanent restrictive procedure without malabsorptive component involve single staple line perform laparoscopically less one hour . While surgical procedure recognize `` standard '' procedure patient fail medical treatment `` cover '' health plan , access procedure limit medically underserved , rural , poor underrepresented minority since national , state municipal health plan either provide minimal coverage coverage surgery morbid obesity . Often , patient wait year elective bariatric procedure . Reimbursement provider offer procedure minimal thus access bariatric surgery unlikely within timely fashion . The laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy involve placement 5 trocars . First , V-shaped liver suspension technique ( V-LIST ) use gain broad operative view gastroesophageal junction [ 11-12 ] silicone Penrose drain insert peritoneal cavity staple par condensa less omentum parietal peritoneum use 2-0 Prolene ( Ethicon ) liver retraction . The left lobe liver retract V-shaped suspension technique . The great curvature stomach free begin 6 cm proximal pylorus angle His harmonic scalpel ( Ethicon ) . Care take preserve gastroepiploic vessel . A bougie ( 36-40 Fr ) place stomach lesser curvature guide staple . Gastric resection perform stapler ( Echelon 60 , Ethicon ) along line parallel bougie begin 6 cm proximal pylorus extend cardia . The remnant stomach remove abdominal cavity slightly enlarge incision Versaport cannula place . A leak check may perform time insufflate gastroscope remnant gastric section submerge irrigation fluid infuse sterile methylene blue nasogastric tube . The staple line may also oversew ( 3-0 Vicryl , Ethicon ) , along bleed leakage area , area potential complication . A nasogastric decompression tube may place monitor bleed intraperitoneal drain place anastomotic stoma . For purpose study consider follow meet criterion population underserved , rural , poor and/or underrepresented : Medically Underserved Populations Populations inadequate access , reduce utilization , high-quality cancer prevention , screen early detection , treatment , and/or rehabilitation service . Included rural , low-literacy , low-income population . An effort clarify define `` medically underserved '' currently underway NIH . Rural The work definition rural , take U.S. Census Bureau , somewhat vague . `` Rural '' define territory , population , housing unit classify `` urban . '' The Census Bureau 's definition `` urban '' place 2,500 person incorporated city , village , borough , town . Poor ( Low Income ) The 1998 DHHS Poverty Guidelines ( also refer `` Federal poverty level '' ) define poverty threshold annual income approximately $ 10,000 single individual annual income approximately $ 20,000 family 4 ( Federal Register 63 , # 36 , February 24 , 1998 , pp 9235-9238 ) . Underrepresented Minority For NCI purpose , person underrepresented minority belongs minority group underrepresented biomedical behavioral science career , base minority group 's representation total population . Using definition available data minority representation health profession , science , engineering , black , Hispanics , American Indian Alaskan Native , Pacific Islanders classify underrepresented minority . Asians consider underrepresented minority . The bariatric surgical procedure , include sleeve gastrectomy , perform UCSF principal investigator , Dr. Stanley J. Rogers , ( Chief Minimally Invasive Surgery Surgical Director Bariatric Surgery ) past 5 year , document zero percent mortality , mean 98 % laparoscopic completion rate mean duration hospitalization 3 day . The cost procedure also relatively inexpensive require le 2 hour surgery time . We propose randomize patient surgical arm ( sleeve gastrectomy ) plus Weight Watchers program Weight Watchers program alone . We employ extensive metric assess impact laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery plus Weight Watchers v . Weight Watchers Program alone monitor 12 month follow : Weight reduction efficacy Self-worth assessment Health care cost Economic productivity Stress anger Intergenerational impact</detailed_description>
