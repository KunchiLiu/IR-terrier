	<brief_summary>Many hospital employ common canister inhaler protocol patient require mechanical ventilator support . Common canister refers single inhaler pair standardized cleaning method use one patient . Small report suggest method pose increase infectious risk associate significant cost saving . Common canister protocol offer solution discordance inhaler sizes average inpatient use drug . Metered dose inhaler canister contain enough drug several day week daily use . However , average length stay inpatient several day . Therefore , inpatient use canister content , unused resource potentially waste . The common canister approach previously describe mechanically ventilated patient ( people require intensive care unit admission breathe machine ) . This study aim assess safety common canister utilization assessment comparison infection rate study control group .</brief_summary>
