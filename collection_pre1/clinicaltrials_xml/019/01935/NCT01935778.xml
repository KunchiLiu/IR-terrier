	<brief_summary>The role post surgery adjuvant chemotherapy become important AGC ( advance gastric cancer ) . S-1 combined therapy Capecitabine Oxaliplatin currently accept standard therapy among AGC patient perform gastrectomy D2 surgery . However , many improvement need stage IIIB IV . Combined chemotherapy Docetaxel , Capecitabine , Oxaliplatin may consider one best treatment IIB IV ( M0 ) stage AGC patient perform gastrectomy .</brief_summary>
