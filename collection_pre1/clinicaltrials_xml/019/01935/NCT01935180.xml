	<brief_summary>Effectiveness screen colonoscopy cancer prevention rely detection removal adenomatous polyp . However , substantial rate adenoma miss colonoscopy . It estimate two third miss adenomas locate proximal aspect colonic fold . Attaching transparent cap tip colonoscope may allow examination proximal aspect colonic fold , early study suggest increased polyp adenoma detection use technology . However , study part substantial methodological limitation ( e.g . miss polyp histology , single endoscopist study , polyp remove time detection ) . Therefore , point unclear whether cap assist colonoscopy may improve adenoma detection . The objective study evaluate whether cap assist colonoscopy improve adenoma detection . The investigator propose two-center multiple endoscopists randomize controlled trial . Patients randomized cap assist colonoscopy standard high definition white light colonoscopy . The cap 4mm commercially available transparent cap attach tip colonoscopy . Primary outcome measure adenoma detection rate ( mean number adenoma per patient ) . The investigator assess adjust possible variable affect adenoma detection , include withdrawal time quality colon preparation . As secondary outcome interest investigator evaluate possible learn curve effect among endoscopists ( minimum six ) new method . In addition investigator evaluate whether cap assist endoscopy improves real time prediction polyp histology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient present colonoscopy meet inclusion exclusion criterion ask participate ( see inclusion exclusion criterion ) . All patient undergo regular bowel preparation polyethylene glycol lavage ( base current standard care ) clear rectal fluid evacuate . Patients randomize one two group : 1 . Standard colonoscopy , 2 . Cap assist colonoscopy . All colonoscopy perform use state art high-definition wide angle colonoscopy . The transparent cap , attach tip colonoscope , 4mm margin extend beyond tip colonoscope . All patient undergo careful endoscopic examination . A timer provide feedback time insertion withdrawal time . Detected polyp assess standard white light narrow band image predict polyp histology ( adenoma versus adenoma ) , resect sent histological evaluation accord standard care . At least 8 experienced endoscopists participate center participate . Each endoscopist perform least 50 cap assist colonoscopy part study . Each endoscopist ask complete survey 10 50 cap assist colonoscopy . Patients randomize block four allocate examiner . The order randomization computer generate . Information randomization contain sealed envelope assign examiner individually open immediately procedure patient 's All participate endoscopist fill questionnaire regard use cap assistance colonoscopy initial 10 cap assist colonoscopy least 50 cap assist cap colonoscopy . Endoscopists also undergo train session respect real time polyp diagnosis study commencement 20 colonoscopy enrollment .</detailed_description>
