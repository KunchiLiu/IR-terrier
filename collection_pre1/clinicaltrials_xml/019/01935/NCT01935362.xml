	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death Western world . Established risk factor include high LDL cholesterol , high blood pressure diabetes . Poor blood vessel health consider predictor future CVD risk , reverse . Several different measurement use determine blood vessel health ; blood pressure ( BP ) , new technique measure blood flow artery blood pressure cuff restrict blood flow minute one arm . Flavonoids compound find plant-based food , associate reduce risk CVD . From previous study , strong evidence orange juice citrus food higher amount specific citrus flavonoid improve cardiovascular risk factor BP blood vessel health . Absorption citrus flavonoid occur colon bacteria breakdown form find food . After flavonoid absorb blood modification liver enzymes excreted urine . A large range citrus flavonoid find excreted urinary , range anywhere 0-57 % dose . Variation potential health effect may reflect level citrus flavonoid absorb , often consider human study . This study 4-week double-blinded , randomize , cross-over intervention trial use commercially-available orange juice supplement placebo control . The aim study determine whether orange juice supplement reduce blood pressure improve blood vessel health 4 week . Furthermore , determine relationship absorption flavonoid ( measure urinary excretion ) change blood pressure blood vessel health . The participant need attend 4 session 4 separate study day , every 4 week 12 week . On study day weight , height , waist circumference , blood pressure measure . A finger-prick blood sample , use single-use lancet ( Accu-Chek Safe T Pro Plus ) , take check fast blood glucose level . Blood flow fingertip monitor reduce blood flow forearm use blood pressure cuff ( call EndoPAT ) . Participants ask collect urine 24 hr study day , consume supplement provide daily two set 4 week ( 4 week middle without supplement ) . An improvement blood pressure and/or blood flow provide evidence blood vessel health improve short-term ( 4 week ) use citrus flavonoid supplement</brief_summary>
