	<brief_summary>The ability old adult improve muscle strength exercise training appear relate well immune system function . Thus , nutritional supplement improve immune function could theoretically boost strength gain old adult exercise . The purpose pilot study determine nutritional supplement effect immune function . Veterans ( age 60-80 yr , N=12 ) randomize double-blind placebo-controlled fashion consume supplement placebo four week . After two week consumption , subject treat vaccine tetanus , diphtheria , pertussis . Blood drawn subject vaccination determine effect supplement immune response vaccination . Additionally , subject undergo blood draw muscle biopsy two week supplementation determine effect supplementation measure immune function ( e.g . cytokine growth factor level ) . This important issue due serious health consequence associate muscle loss older adult need improved strategy rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
