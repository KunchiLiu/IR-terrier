	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial study side effect best dose ipilimumab give together cetuximab intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) treat patient previously untreated stage III-IVB head neck cancer . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab cetuximab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Specialized radiation therapy , IMRT , delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Giving ipilimumab together cetuximab IMRT may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify start dose ipilimumab , combination standard cetuximab-IMRT patient high- intermediate-risk , locally advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) , use future clinical efficacy trial . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate clinical response patient high- intermediate-risk , locally advanced HNSCC treat regimen use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion . II . To estimate 2-year progression-free survival patient high- intermediate-risk , locally advanced HNSCC treat regimen . III . To investigate serum , lymphocyte tissue biomarkers predictor progression-free survival , toxicity outcome parameter patient high- intermediate-risk , locally advanced HNSCC treat regimen . IV . To estimate association dose-response modeling dose ipilimumab , clinical response biomarkers . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ipilimumab . Patients receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 60-120 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment cetuximab repeat every 4 week 2 course . Beginning week 2 course 1 , patient undergo concurrent IMRT 5 day per week 7 week . Beginning week 4 ( day 1 course 2 ) patient also receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 21 day 3 course . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve disease progression may undergo surgery completion therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , every 12 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
