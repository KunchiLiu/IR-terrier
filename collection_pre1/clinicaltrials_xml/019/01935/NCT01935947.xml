	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well azacitidine entinostat chemotherapy work treat patient non-small cell lung cancer spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , irinotecan hydrochloride , gemcitabine hydrochloride , docetaxel , pemetrexed disodium , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Entinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving azacitidine entinostat chemotherapy may work well treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Entinostat Before Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Percentage patient progression-free 6 month time randomization . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . Overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-6 8-10 entinostat orally ( PO ) day 3 10 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable progressive disease receive chemotherapy treat oncologist 's choice comprise irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , docetaxel IV day 1 , pemetrexed disodium IV day 1 , gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive azacitidine PO day 1-21 entinostat PO day 3 10 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable progressive disease receive chemotherapy treat oncologist 's choice Arm A . ARM C : Patients receive chemotherapy treat oncologist 's choice Arm A . After completion treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 24 month yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
