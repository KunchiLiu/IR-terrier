	<brief_summary>Sleep apnea syndrome strongly associate type 2 diabet , partly partly due obesity . Treatment sleep apnea may improve hypertension , cardiovascular risk study diabetes status . Few data available type 1 diabetes suggest prevalence sleep apnea syndrome may high . We plan compare prevalence sleep apnea syndrome assess polysomnography sample type 1 diabetic patient control group match age , gender body mass index . The secondary objective determine presence autonomic neuropathy poorly control diabetes ( assess glycosylated haemoglobin ) may contribute presence sleep apnea diabetic group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diagnostic protocol design evaluate sleep apnea syndrome frequent type 1 diabetes general population therefore deserve systematically suspect actively diagnosed patient . Sleep apnea syndrome heavy burden matter quality life : responsible fatigue , diurnal sleepiness , cognitive impairment , poor /or non restorative sleep , morning headache , depressive moodâ€¦Adequate treatment provide rapid , time , complete relief symptom . On hand , Sleep Apnea independent risk factor cardiovascular mortality morbidity young middle age subject , also reverse treatment . It might therefore important type 1 diabetic patient already increase cardiovascular risk properly diagnose sleep apnea . A systematic screening sleep apnea already recommend patient type 2 diabetes expert . A secondary objective determine presence sleep apnea syndrome type 1 diabetic patient associate autonomic neuropathy , poor glycemic control , poor quality life , poor quality sleep , severe cardiovascular consequence biological impairment .</detailed_description>
