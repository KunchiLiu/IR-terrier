	<brief_summary>Medically unexplained symptom ( MUS ) common important problem primary care . Patients repeatedly present MUS general practitioner ( GP ) suffer symptom , functionally impaired , risk unnecessary possibly harmful test , referral treatment . Evidence indicate specific intervention patient MUS , reattribution therapy cognitive behavioural therapy limit help . According expert field multi-component approach helpful patient . This pilot trial aim test systematic identification eligible patient , assess acceptability intervention estimate potential treatment effect large trial . It 's randomise pilot study consist patient MUS primary care . Patients randomize intervention ( usual care additional psychosomatic therapy ) control condition ( usual care alone ) . Patients follow one year . Participants patient consult GP MUS GP presume psychosocial distress underlie cause . The intervention psychosomatic therapy deliver psychosomatic therapist , consist combination information education , relaxation therapy mindfulness , cognitive approach activate therapy . This multi-component approach capture protocol therapist able modify treatment order deliver tailor-made treatment patient MUS . Primary outcome measure : number patient identify recruit , perceive symptom severity , measure Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) patient ' self-rated symptom distress , depression , anxiety somatization ( 4DSQ : The Four Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire ) . Other primary outcome measure time need include eligible patient , number withdrawal intervention control group , compliance therapy group number patient complete questionnaire . Secondary outcome measure : symptom hyperventilation ( NHL : Nijmegen Hyperventilation List ) , physical mental health status quality life ( SF-36 ) , level functioning ( MAF : measure general functioning ) . Patient satisfaction receive therapy rat 5-point Likert-type scale . Medical consumption measure Cost Diary medical consumption .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment sign informed consent : Participating GPs ( n=6 ) ask enrol consecutive eligible patient include 10 patient MUS . The GPs present write information inform consent form patient . Patients opportunity read information consider participation sign consent form . Randomisation : Participating patient ( n=60 ) equally randomise two group , intervention group ( usual care psychosomatic therapy deliver psychosomatic therapist ) control group ( usual care GP ) . For randomisation use random number table , whereas central blind allocation procedure applied.For randomisation use random number table , whereas central blind allocation procedure apply . Patients intervention group ask complete questionnaire baseline , end intervention ( +/- 3 month ) 6 12 month . Patients control group complete questionnaire baseline , 3 ( equal end intervention ) , 6 12 month . Statistical analysis The number patient identify recruited GP well number eligible patient decline enter trial analyse use descriptive statistic . Furthermore , stage study , record number trial participant complete study . The effect intervention primary outcome measure ( VAS 4DSQ ) secondary outcome measure ( NHL , SF-36 MAF ) estimate use analysis covariance baseline value covariate . Data analysis perform accord intention-to-treat principle . Medical consumption measure use Cost Diary medical consumption . Patients record absenteeism healthcare consumption , consult GP , hospital , paramedic facility alternative medicine . Medication intake record start end study . We use standardise Dutch price ( guide cost research 2009 ) , whereas medication cost calculate accord Dutch Pharmaco Therapeutic Compass . Costs absenteeism calculate accord Friction Cost method . Difference cost medical consumption control intervention group estimate use analysis covariance baseline value covariate . Difference baseline characteristic analyse student 's t-test continue variable chi-squared test Fisher 's exact test categorical variable . P-values &lt; 0.05 consider statistical significant .</detailed_description>
