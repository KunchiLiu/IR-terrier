	<brief_summary>With improvement CT scanner injector , diagnostic chest CT perform less 10 second . It hypothesize diagnostic CT pulmonary angiogram could do less usual 80-120 ml contrast use . We develop method perform diagnostic CT pulmonary angiogram 30 ml intravenous contrast patient . The long-term objective study show difference diagnostic efficacy low dose 30 ml technique compare traditional full-dose technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Low ( 30ml ) Versus Full Dose ( 100ml ) Contrast CT Pulmonary Angiography Detecting Emboli</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Potential participant study refer radiology section CTPA suspect pulmonary embolus . The radiologist review patient 's record CPRS , do routinely situation . Patients class 3 4 CHF , supraventricular tachycardia , Serum Creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl ( &gt; 1.3 mg/dl female ) , history contrast allergy , unable give inform consent exclude arm study . Patients serum creatinine &gt; 1.28 mg/dl require refer physician approval . If participant appear qualify study study physician contact refer physician inform him/her study . If refer physician agreeable either radiologist refer physician approach patient , either bedside radiology clinic determine patient interested participating study . If , study radiologist begin inform consent process . After informed consent obtain subject computer randomize either new low-dose full-dose technique protocol . A total 220 study ( 110 per group ) perform . Multidetector CT Scan : All CT examination perform Siemens Sensation 64-MDCT scanner . Visipaque ( Iodixanol ) 320 non-ionic isoosmolar contrast agent use contrast examination follow subsequent injection normal saline . An informed write consent injection IV contrast obtain prior CT examination . Safe venous access obtain via either antecubital vein central venous line . For low dose CT pulmonary angiogram , 30 ml IV Radio Contrast Material ( RCM ) inject flow rate 5 ml/second follow injection 20 ml normal saline 5ml/second . The region interest ( ROI ) superior vena cava ( SVC ) approximate level aortic arch . The scan trigger begin 75 Hounsfield unit ( HU ) . For Full dose CT pulmonary angiogram , 100 ml IV RCM inject flow rate 5ml/sec . The ROI main pulmonary artery . The scan trigger 120 HU . One mm contiguous axial spiral scan obtain apex lung adrenal . Reformatted 1.5 mm axial , 3 mm axial , 1.5 mm coronal sagittal image obtain . All image upload AGFA Picture Archiving Communication System ( PACS ) workstation interpretation . The cost CT scan RCM cover Department Imaging majority study part routine clinical care .</detailed_description>
