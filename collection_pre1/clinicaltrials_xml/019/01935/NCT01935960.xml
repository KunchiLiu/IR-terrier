	<brief_title>Retinoid 9cUAB30 Preventing Cancer Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity recommend phase II dose 9cUAB30 ( retinoid 9cUAB30 ) . II . To characterize urine plasma single dose steady state pharmacokinetics 9cUAB30 normal volunteer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate pharmacokinetics 9cUAB30 toxicity . II . To compare observed toxicity placebo control dose level . III . To assess change single dose pharmacokinetics ( PK ) repeat dose ( day 1 vs. day 36 ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Participants randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Participants receive retinoid 9cUAB30 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1 8-36 . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Participants receive placebo PO QD day 1 8-36 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 7 30 day .</detailed_description>
