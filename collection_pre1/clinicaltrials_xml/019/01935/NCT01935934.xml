	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-S-Malate Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy single agent cabozantinib-s-malate ( cabozantinib ) woman previously receive one line chemotherapy metastatic endometrial cancer progression within 12 month complete adjuvant therapy , co-primary endpoint objective response rate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 progression-free-survival 12 week ( PFS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Correlation clinical response : baseline molecular status archival tumor ( hepatocyte growth factor receptor [ c-met ] amplification &amp; mutation status ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 week .</detailed_description>
