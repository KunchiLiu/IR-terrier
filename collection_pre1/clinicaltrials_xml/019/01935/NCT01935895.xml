	<brief_summary>Introduction : Daily stress level population increase last decade . Frequent spouse stress consider important risk factor development cardiovascular disease . Other well document risk factor cardiovascular disease systemic hypertension , turn , relate elevate blood pressure reactivity ( BPR ) stress . The exacerbated BPR may suggest poor autonomic modulation due elevate sympathetic tone , condition associate medium long-term cardiovascular complication . Also , report demonstrate individual hyper-reactive stress chronically increase risk psychological disorder anxiety , irritability frustration . These feeling associate increased sympathetic tone induce chronic elevation BP . Although hemodynamic benefit aerobic resistance exercise document variety reports5 , acute effect aforementioned exercise mode combine circuit method post-exercise BP , include response cardiovascular stressor test need investigation . Objective : To investigate blood pressure ( BP ) responses cardiovascular stressor test combine exercise circuit session moderate intensity . Methods : Twenty individual ( 10male/10fem ; 33.4±6.9years ; 70.2±15.8kg ; 170.4±11.5cm ; 22.3±6.8 % body fat ) volunteer randomly perform different day : 1 ) Exercise session consist 3-laps circuit model follow sequence : knee extension , bench press , knee flexion , row prone , squat , shoulder press 5-min aerobic exercise 75-85 % age-predicted maximum heart rate and/or 13 Borg-Scale [ 6-20 ] . The set resistance exercise compose 15 repetition ~50 % one repetition maximum test ; 2 ) control session without exercise . The systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) measure rest 1h recovery experimental session . After , blood pressure reactivity ( BPR ) evaluate use Cold Pressor Test ( test hand cold water one minute ) . The hypothesis exercise session occur attenuation blood pressure increase Cold Pressor Test compare sit without exercise ( control session ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>* Subjects : - Twenty apparently healthy individual gender ( 10 men 10 woman ) mean age 33.4±6.9 year ( 24 - 50 year ) , weight 70.2±15.8 kg ( 45 - 96 kg ) , height 170.4±11.5 cm ( 149 - 192 cm ) , body mass index ( BMI ) 23.9±3.5 kg/m2 ( -1 ) ( 19.2 - 23.7 kg/m2 ( -1 ) ) percent body fat 22.3±6.8 % ( 8.5 - 35.0 % ) volunteer participation . The classification subject `` apparently healthy '' perform risk stratification criterion American College Sports Medicine 1995 ( interview sign , symptom and/or cardiopulmonary risk factor ) . No subject use medication history diagnose cardiovascular metabolic disease . The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki approve Institutional Committe ( CEDEP - COMITÊ DE ÉTICA E DEONTOLOGIA EM ESTUDOS E PESQUISAS ) , Petrolina-PE ( protocol 0047.0.441.000-10 ) . All participant inform experimental method give write consent . - Anthropometric Assessment : - Standard procedure use measure weight , height body mass index ( BMI ) . Body density determine specification Jackson &amp; Pollock16 men ( [ 1,1093800 - 0,0008267 * ( sum skinfolds chest , abdomen thigh ) + 0,0000016 * ( sum skinfolds chest , abdomen thigh ) 2 - 0,0002574 * age ] ) Jackson et al.17 woman ( [ 1,0994921 - 0,0009929 * ( sum skinfolds triceps , suprailiac thigh ) + 0,0000023 * ( sum skinfolds triceps , suprailiac thigh ) 2 - 0,0001392 * age ] ) . Body fat percentage derive Siri equation ( [ 4.91 / density - 4.5 ] * 100 ) . - Blood Pressure Measurement : - All BP measurement perform trained technician auscultatory method follow previously describe recommendations18 , use stethoscope ( Duo Sonic , Brazil ) calibrate sphygmomanometer ( Missouri , São Paulo , SP , Brazil ) certify Inmetro ( National Institute Metrology , Quality Technology ) . Measurements take left arm individual comfortably seat calm control room temperature 25o C. The auscultatory procedure ensure automate previously validated19 oscillometric method ( Microlife , BP 3AC1-1 , USA ) . Briefly , 30 independent individual ( another sample individual ) gender rest ten minute BP randomly measure auscultatory oscilometric method , last blind conduct another evaluator . Correlations method r=0.90 ( p &lt; 0.001 ) systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) r=0.80 ( p &lt; 0.001 ) diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) . Also , agreement method examine use Bland &amp; Altman20 procedure . Mean differences 3.9 mmHg [ 20.2/-12.4 mmHg ] -3.4 mmHg [ 10.5/-17.3 mmHg ] SBP DBP , respectively . - Blood Pressure Reactivity ( BPR ) Assessment : - BPR measurement perform use Cold Pressor Test ( CPT ) accord specification previously describe Hines &amp; Brow3 . These author demonstrate high reproducibility procedure normotensive hypertensive individual . The protocol consist one minute immersion right hand water carefully keep 4º C ( Incoterm® , Porto Alegre , RS ) . BP measurement respectively take 30 60 second immersion auscultatory method . The two BP value respectively name Peak30 '' Peak60 '' procedure consider index BPR . BP also measure two minute immersion cessation ( After2 ' ) . Of note , adoption auscultatory method BP evaluation due requirement measurement 30 60 second , would possible use automate oscillometric device . - Experimental Sessions : - Volunteers randomly underwent two experimental session different day separate 48 72 hour . The combined exercise session consist 3 lap circuit model two minute recovery among lap , perform follow resistance aerobic exercise : knee extension , bench press , knee flexion , row prone , squat , shoulder press five minute 15 centimeter high step 75-85 % heart rate maximum and/or 13 rate perceive exertion ( RPE ) Borg Scale score 6 20 points21 . Resistance exercise load implement use dumbbell upper body exercise weight attach legs arm low body exercise . Each resistance exercise perform 15 repetition estimative 50 % one repetition maximum test suggest Tiggemann et al.22,23 utilization RPE21 . One second concentric phase one second eccentric phase resistance exercise perform rhythmic control ( Metronome Plus® ) . The control session conduct condition combine exercise session , exception subject perform exercise . - Measurements Experimental Sessions : - Resting SBP , DBP mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) measurements take five minute interval 20 minute average consider analysis ( Missouri , São Paulo , SP , Brazil ) . Also , BP measure circuit lap 15 minute interval post-exercise recovery one hour . The timeline measure follow control session . The CPT conduct session ( 20 minute rest ) one hour combine exercise control session . Heart Rate ( HR ) also measure exercise respective moment control session ( Pulse Tronic Club Trainer®/ Direction Technology Co/Suiça ) . The HR measurement consider aerobic exercise control identification cardiovascular load impose experimental session . RPE take combined exercise session control exercise intensity mean value consider subsequent analysis . - Statistical Analyses : - Data present use descriptive statistic procedure mean , standard deviation well low maximum value . The Shapiro-Wilk test use verify present normality data distribution . Pearson correlation use examine relationship rest BP measure different method ( i.e. , auscultatory oscillometric ) , well BPR different moment BP response exercise control session . The Bland &amp; Altman20 technique conduct verify agreement two BP measurement method . Paired-samples test use compare data correspondent moment experimental session . A two-way repeated measure ANOVA conduct compare BP BPR response within experimental session [ Time ( Pre vs. Post ) * Session ( Exercise vs. Control ) ] . Data consider significant P &lt; 0.05 statistical analysis perform use SPSS15.0 software ( SPSS , Chicago , IL ) .</detailed_description>
