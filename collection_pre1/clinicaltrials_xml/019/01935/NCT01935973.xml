	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well trametinib without GSK 2141795 ( protein kinase B [ Akt ] inhibitor GSK2141795 ) work treat patient endometrial cancer come back ( recurrent ) go remission despite treatment ( persistent ) . Trametinib Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether trametinib effective treatment endometrial cancer give without ATK inhibitor GSK2141795 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib With Without GSK2141795 Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess relative activity trametinib ( mitogen-activated protein kinase [ MEK ] inhibitor ) alone combination GSK2141795 ( AKT inhibitor ) patient recurrent persistent endometrial cancer progression-free survival . ( Phase II ) II . To determine frequency severity adverse event assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . ( Phase II ) III . To determine tolerability combination regimen trametinib GSK2141795 determination dose-limiting toxicity two-stage safety lead study . ( Safety assessment lead-in ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate association baseline Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) status clinical activity ( e.g . response progression-free survival [ PFS ] ) patient recurrent persistent endometrial cancer treat trametinib alone combination GSK2141795 . II . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) patient recurrent persistent endometrial cancer treat trametinib therapy alone ( exclude patient cross-over ) trametinib/GSK2141795 combination therapy two subgroup patient define . III . Prognostic factor examine association patient crossover . IV . To estimate objective response response duration associate trametinib therapy trametinib/GSK2141795 combination therapy two subgroup patient define . V. To estimate relative proportion patient respond 6-month PFS therapy administer study study may serve historical control . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate association baseline genomic biomarkers phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) /AKT pathway clinical activity ( e.g . response PFS ) two subgroup patient define recurrent persistent endometrial cancer treat trametinib alone combination GSK2141795 . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve disease progression may cross Arm II . ARM II : Patients receive trametinib PO QD Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
