	<brief_summary>The stimulation frequency find affect axial symptom freeze gait ( FOG ) speech advance Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation ( STN DBS ) , traditionally high stimulation frequency 130 Hz worsen low frequency 60 Hz improve symptom . The effect stimulation frequency another important axial symptom , swallow dysfunction , study . The investigator hypothesize stimulation frequency could similar effect swallow function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DBS Frequency Swallowing Function Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first study effect stimulation frequency swallow function PD patient STN DBS . Swallowing dysfunction often difficult treat pharmacologically associate increased morbidity mortality . This study hence would significant clinical implication management swallow dysfunction PD patient STN DBS could potentially decrease morbidity mortality . The investigator expect traditionally high frequency stimulation 130 Hz would worsen low frequency stimulation 60 Hz would improve swallow function OPMS summary</detailed_description>
