	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ponatinib hydrochloride work treat patient stage III-IV lung cancer . Ponatinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ponatinib Patients With Lung Cancer Preselected Using Different Candidate Predictive Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study look safety effectiveness investigational drug ponatinib lung cancer . The investigator hope ponatinib work tumor certain biomarkers . Therefore , study pre-screen patient certain biomarkers enrol main treatment study . Different dose ponatinib may test study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PART A : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm locally advance ( failure local therapy ) metastatic lung cancer ( histology , except carcinoid ) stage IIIa , IIIb IV PART A : Existing formalin fix paraffin embed biopsy lung cancer potentially sufficient material analysis PART A : Nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) adenocarcinoma histology must previously test epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangements PART A : Able ( physically financially ) travel University Colorado clinical trial treatment PART B : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm locally advance ( failure local therapy ) metastatic lung cancer ( histology , except carcinoid ) stage IIIa , IIIb IV PART B : Patients must prove meet marker criterion ( FGFR1 silver situ hybridization ( SISH ) + situ hybridization ( ISH ) + , FGFR1 SISH+ ISH negative [ ] , FGFR1 SISHve ISH+ , FGFR1 SISHve ISHve [ FGFR1 double negative cohort ] ret protooncogene [ RET ] FISH+ ) prior enrollment Part B ( treatment ) ; adenocarcinoma patient must know posse either EGFR mutation ALK rearrangement tumor ( positive one , test require ) PART B : Patients must measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 PART B : Patients may receive number line prior therapy PART B : Life expectancy &gt; = 3 month PART B : Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status = &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; = 60 % ) PART B : Leukocytes &gt; = 3,000/mcL PART B : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/mcL PART B : Hemoglobin &gt; = 9 g/dL PART B : Platelets &gt; = 100,000/mcL PART B : Total bilirubin = &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) , unless due Gilbert 's syndrome PART B : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [ SGPT ] ) = &lt; 2.5 X ULN PART B : Creatinine = &lt; 1.5 X ULN OR creatinine clearance &gt; = 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal PART B : Serum lipase = &lt; 1.5 X ULN PART B : Serum amylase = &lt; 1.5 X ULN PART B : Previous treatment related sideeffects/adverse event must resolve least grade 1 , discretion investigator , select stable grade 2 toxicity ( e.g . alopecia fatigue ) may permissible unchanging grade least 3 month follow discussion principal investigator ( PI ) PART B : Patients central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases eligible enrollment overt evidence neurological deficit , require antiepileptic steroid control neurological symptom ; patient know CNS metastasis must relevant CNS image perform approximately coincident body image response assessment PART B : The effect ponatinib develop human fetus unknown ; reason woman childbearing potential must negative urine blood pregnancy test screen Part B ; woman childbearing potential men must also document agreement use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) time screen 30 day end study treatment ; woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately PART B : Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document PART A : Known EGFR mutation and/or ALK rearrangement NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology PART B : No previous treatment standard investigational anticancer agent within predict 5 halflives agent ; 28 day whichever shorter ; plasma halflife know previous therapy monoclonal antibody 28 day washout period consider default requirement PART B : No previous current exposure FGFR inhibitor FGFRselected cohort , RET inhibitor RET select cohort PART B : Prior radiotherapy propose target lesion permit unless complete 4 week prior treatment within study document progression site ; radiotherapy nontarget lesion permit within 2 week study entry provide acute effect radiotherapy resolve = &lt; grade 1 PART B : History allergic severe reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ponatinib PART B : Ponatinib substrate cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A , polypeptide 4/5 ( CYP3A4/5 ) , concurrent use potent CYP3A4/5 inhibitor inducer undertaken caution PART B : History clinically significant bleed disorder PART B : History acute pancreatitis within 1 year study history chronic pancreatitis PART B : Uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia ( triglyceride &gt; 450 mg/dL ) PART B : Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : Ongoing active infection require intravenous antibiotic Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within 3 month prior enrollment part B study History clinically significant ( determined treat medical doctor [ MD ] ) cardiac arrhythmia ( atrial ventricular ) PART B : Patients major surgery within 28 day prior enter study recover adverse event &gt; grade 1 relate surgery PART B : Pregnant breastfeed woman PART B : Patients inability take oral medication , , investigator 's opinion , gastrointestinal condition abnormality likely influence absorption oral medication PART B : Concomitant use medication know associated torsadesdepointes</criteria>
