	<brief_summary>The rationale study investigate effect topical diclofenac tumor metabolism treatment actinic keratoses immunocompetent immunocompromised patient . Study hypothesis topical diclofenac lower lactate level skin biopsy actinic keratoses . Planned number patient 38 . This study monocenter study investigate effect 3 % diclofenac 2.5 % hyaluronic acid gel tumor metabolism treatment actinic keratoses . Treatment duration 3 month . Skin biopsy obtain treatment , end treatment four week treatment . Control biopsies visit 1 3 perform healthy , sun damage untreated skin . Evaluation efficacy perform end treatment four week treatment . Duration treatment 3 month ( ±4 week ) . Approximately 0,5g Solaraze® 3 % gel apply 5cm x 5cm lesion . Solaraze® 3 % gel apply twice daily study lesion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neoplastic cell show increase glucose metabolism glycolysis associate high lactate concentration . There also data several tumor entity high level lactate tumor associate tumor progression , metastasis poor clinical outcome . Kreutz et al . demonstrate diclofenac inhibits tumor cell proliferation vitro tumor growth vivo via COX-independent effect glucose metabolism . Diclofenac take tumor cell inhibit tumor cell proliferation inhibition oncogene MYC subsequently glycolysis block lactate transport . MYC regulate gene involve glycolysis upregulated neoplastic cell , line metabolic switch glycolysis , call `` Warburg effect '' , cancer cell show . Although result find vitro use human melanoma cell vivo mouse model , similar mechanism action assume relevant treatment actinic keratoses topical diclofenac . However tumor metabolism diclofenac-treated actinic keratoses never investigate . To investigate mechanism action diclofenac treatment actinic keratoses , clinical study analyze particularly lactate level , glycolysis inflammatory infiltrate need .</detailed_description>
