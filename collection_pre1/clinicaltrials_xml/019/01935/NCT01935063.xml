	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic pain problem involve female reproductive system major health concern woman age . As condition poorly understood often misdiagnosed ignore , entail great personal cost patient significant financial cost society . One condition vulvodynia , chronic unexplained vulvar pain . A recent population-based study suggest lifetime cumulative incidence vulvodynia 16 % , indicate approximately 2.5 million Canadian woman may experience idiopathic vulvar pain lifetime . Provoked vestibulodynia ( PVD ) - acute recurrent pain localize within vulvar vestibule experience primarily sexual intercourse - suspected frequent cause vulvodynia premenopausal woman , prevalence estimate 12 % community sample . Despite high prevalence negative impact psychosexual functioning , paucity control research provide empirically validate treatment afflict couple . The present proposal draw previous cross-sectional prospective CIHR fund research dyadic determinant pain psychosexual impairment woman PVD partner , well past randomize trial evaluate efficacy group cognitive-behavioral therapy condition . Specifically , goal study evaluate efficacy target cognitive-behavioral couple therapy ( CBCT ) intervention develop treatment PVD . Objectives : The propose two-centre randomized clinical trial aim evaluate efficacy novel 12-week targeted couple therapy intervention ( CBCT ) woman PVD comparison one frequently prescribe first line medical intervention , topical lidocaine , show effective safe management PVD . The primary research question focus whether significant difference two treatment woman 's pain intercourse post-treatment . Secondary research question focus whether significant difference two treatment post-treatment 6-month follow-up ( ) multidimensional aspect woman 's pain McGill Pain Questionnaire ( b ) woman partner ' sexuality ( sexual function satisfaction , frequency intercourse ) , psychological adjustment ( anxiety , depression , catastrophizing , self-efficacy , pain attribution , quality life , acceptance pain , compassionate love partner , self-compassion , emotion regulation thought feeling related pain experience ) , relationship factor ( partner response , dyadic adjustment , attachment , communication ) self-reported improvement treatment satisfaction . We also examine whether childhood trauma co-morbid pain condition moderate treatment response . Finally , third research question evaluate role hormonal contraceptive use risk PVD . Research plan/methodology : The propose research 3.5-year , two-centre parallel randomize controlled trial PVD use intent-to-treat analysis strategy , pain intercourse primary outcome . The main research question address : 1 ) recruit 224 premenopausal woman partner medically diagnose PVD ; 2 ) perform comprehensive gynecological psychosexual pre-treatment evaluation focus outcome measure ; 3 ) randomly assign woman one two 12-week treatment arm : CBCT lidocaine , 4 ) evaluate pain intercourse , well sexual , psychological relationship outcome , addition self-reported improvement treatment satisfaction , post-treatment 6-month follow-up . These procedure take place two different university center : Université de Montréal Montréal , Québec , Dalhousie University Halifax , Nova Scotia , affiliate hospital . Both university centre store data securely , adhere protocol outline ethic review board site . Statistical Analyses : Analyses conduct base intention treat . Descriptive statistic use define compare participant intervention group . More specifically , calculate mean , median , deviation interquartile range T-tests used determine difference group socio-demographic variable . Chi-square test observe difference group use categorical variable . If difference observe group , variable control subsequent analysis . We verify variable normally distribute . If variable normally distribute , non-parametric test employ . A repeated measure analysis variance permit assessment efficacy two treatment post-treatment 6-month follow-up . The analysis focus change pain experienced intercourse pre-treatment assessment post-treatment 6-months follow-up . To , time intra-subject variable , experimental condition inter-subject variable . For secondary analysis , multiple analysis conduct multiple step , multivariate analysis conduct first repeat measure ( MANOVA ) . Correlated measure group base conceptual domain ( e.g. , pain , dyadic adjustment , catastrophizing ) . Univariate analysis conduct multivariate result significant ( ANOVA ) . This follow orthogonal contrast examine change different measurement . Moreover , use exploratory analysis participant complete experimental protocol determine effect protocol adherence treatment efficacy . Multiple regression analysis use examine link socio-demographic variable , pre-treatment dependent variable pain post-treatment 6-months follow-up identify factor associate therapeutic success . These latter analysis conduct treatment group separately . Bonferroni correction use analysis multiple comparison adjustment . In case miss data , explore effect withdrawal sensitivity analysis , replace miss data data recent assessment average aggregate value . Significance study : Results propose research may improve health quality life Canadians afflict highly prevalent neglected woman 's health problem - vulvodynia - provide rigorous test efficacy novel target couple therapy intervention .</detailed_description>
