	<detailed_description>Very recently , pioglitazone ban use type 2 diabetes patient India well , notification Government India base case series - ban revoke day later due lack evidence . The incidence rate bladder cancer among different ethnicity differ markedly , Caucasians high incidence . Another important distinction pertains dose pioglitazone- daily dose pioglitazone use previous study ( western country ) 45 mg , high currently prescribe India ( 7.5-30 mg ) . Therefore risk bladder cancer Indian patient extrapolated study conduct region world . Consequently , interest issue explore risk bladder cancer amongst pioglitazone-users setting different ethnicity risk profile . There single report eight case sporadic bladder cancer India.10 However , study denominator study India explore relationship pioglitazone bladder cancer . Furthermore risk bladder cancer high male great 50 year . The risk factor smoke , occupational exposure aromatic amine metal , leather , paint industry etc. , common male . The increase , , rate bladder cancer pioglitazone expect high group . The result currently available study either in-vitro , animal , human ( observational ) link pioglitazone bladder cancer consistent . Whether positive link patient use pioglitazone study could due drug per se , due underlie disease diabetes , interaction concomitant drug , inherent flaw associate study design statistical analysis , different ethnicity study , worthy discussion . Diabetes per se may increase risk cancer , probably via activation Ras/Raf mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway association reduction expression epidermal growth factor receptor . In fact , epidemiologic study also suggest increase risk bladder cancer diabetic patient , independent commonly used oral anti-diabetic agent insulin . Hence plan investigate risk bladder cancer type 2 diabetes subject use pioglitazone compare never expose pioglitazone . We thoroughly scrutinize record also interview subject regard risk factor bladder cancer addition pioglitazone .</detailed_description>
