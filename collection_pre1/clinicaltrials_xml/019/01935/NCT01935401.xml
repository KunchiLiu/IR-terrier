	<detailed_description>Bulimia nervosa ( BN ) , serious psychiatric disorder high rate comorbidity often result role impairment suffer . Thus far , although psychosocial behavioral risk factor correlate BN extensively research , relatively study focus brain-based determinant BN . Identification neural mechanism associate self-regulatory control may integral development , maintenance , prevention debilitate condition would better inform treatment development eat disorder prevention effort . Participation study consist 3-3.5 hour study visit well one year follow visit . The first portion initial study visit part screen process , individual complete several questionnaire interview study researcher order confirm eligibility . If participant eligible screen portion , move onto rest initial visit . During initial visit , participant complete button press go/no-go task well sip go/no-go task , wear functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIR ) device . At one year follow appointment , individual complete variety self-report questionnaire interview study researcher , thus complete measure use screening tool initial visit .</detailed_description>
