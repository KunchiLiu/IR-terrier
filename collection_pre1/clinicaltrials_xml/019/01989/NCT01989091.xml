	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : B-Lock safe effective catheter lock solution maintain catheter patency reduce Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections ( CLABSI ) dialysis patient use central venous catheter ( CVC ) vascular access . The study prospective , randomize , site unblinded/sponsor blind , clinical study minimum 300 dialysis patient use central venous catheter ( CVC ) vascular access . Patients randomize 1:1 receive either investigational medical device ( B-Lock IMD ) active control heparin ( 5000 U/mL ) ( ACH ) observe minimum 45 day maximum 273 ( expect average 160 day ) . IMD ACH instill catheter lumen ( dual lumen catheter ) end dialysis session remove prior initiation next dialysis session . The primary objective study : - To demonstrate safety B-Lock dialysis patient - To demonstrate non-inferiority , proven non-inferior , superiority B-Lock relative ACH respect maintain catheter patency define use recombinant tissue plasminogen activator maintain adequate blood flow dialysis catheter - To demonstrate superiority B-Lock relative ACH respect incidence CLABSI</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient age 18 80 year , inclusive . Patients , age 81 85 year , inclusive , may include casebycase basis health status determine stable consultation Medical Monitor . Patients endstage renal disease receive hemodialysis via CVC . Patients must expect receive hemodialysis direct cuffed , tunnel dual lumen catheter 2 cuffed , tunnel single lumen catheter minimum 45 catheterdays Day 1 . Patients must receive dialysis minimum 6 dialysis session study center dialysis clinic prior sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . Patients must receive dialysis prescribe blood flow rate ( +/ 10 % ) least 2 consecutive dialysis session prior sign ICF . Patients must 2 screen prepump arterial pressure measurement ( collect first 20 minute dialysis ) differ less equal ( ≤ ) 20 mmHg 2 consecutive dialysis session receive dialysis prescribe blood flow rate ( +/ 10 % ) prior randomization . Clinical sign and/or symptom local systemic infection within 14 day prior Day 1 . Evidence infection catheter exit site/tunnel within 14 day prior Day 1 . Patients receive systemic antibiotic within 14 day prior Day 1 . History fever ( T &gt; 37.5°C ) chill within 14 day prior Day 1 . An occluded catheter ( blood flow inadequate dialysis ) catheter require thrombolytic treatment within 14 day prior Day 1 . A catheter coat impregnated antithrombotic , antimicrobial antiseptic agent , include heparin . A catheter coat impregnated antithrombotic , antimicrobial antiseptic agent , include heparin . Catheters deem manufacturer incompatible alcoholcontaining solution . These include , limited : 1 . Angiodynamics LifeJet® VP VascPak Catheter . 2 . Angiodynamics Schon™ Chronic Hemodialysis Catheter . 3 . Angiotech Hemostream™ Chronic Dialysis Catheter . 4 . Bard Bard Catheters . The use TEGO® TEGOlike catheter cap . Patients may switch standard catheter cap order participate study . Patients know documented allergy TMP TMPcontaining drug , ethanol , ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , propylene glycol and/or glycerin . Patients history heparininduced thrombocytopenia use heparin contraindicate . ( Note : If use heparin restrict specified period time , patient may enrol later date use heparin longer contraindicate . ) Evidence acute/ongoing hepatic injury ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] &gt; 300 IU/L ) chronic hepatic insufficiency ( Total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL and/or albumin &lt; 3.0 g/dL Screening within 30 day prior Screening ) . Note : A patient whose albumin level low solely due nephrotic syndrome may enrol ( Medical Monitor approval ) albumin level stable least 3 month prior ICF signature . Patients Investigator believe prognosis survival le 3 month .</criteria>
