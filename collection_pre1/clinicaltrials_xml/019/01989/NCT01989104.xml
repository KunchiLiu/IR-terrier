	<detailed_description>Procedure - 1 visit - ( approximately 3 hour total ) Day Testing : Participant must FASTED - No food 4 hour visit . All study procedure involve participant complete single test session ( one-day - approximately 3 hour ) Pennington Biomedical Research Center . If prefer , two visit separate day schedule complete protocol . - Screening question ( approximately 3-5 minute ) Participants ( legal guardian ) ask answer several screen question determine eligibility participate CADENCE-KIDS . - Height weight measure data collection ( approximately 10 minute ) - Height measure . - Body weight body fat percentage measure use specialize scale . - Waist circumference measure use measure tape . - Instrument attachment , treadmill walking , free-living activity ( approximately 140 minute ) - Participants fit 10 device ( Digi-Walker Pedometer , NL-1000 Pedometer , StepWatch Activity Monitor , SenseWear Armband , GT3X+ accelerometer , GENEActiv Accelerometer , Actical Accelerometer , ActivPal Accelerometer , Polar Heart Rate Monitor , K4b2 Portable Metabolic Unit ) measure/monitor physical activity throughout test session . - Participants complete several low intensity free-living activity physical activity oxygen uptake concurrently assess . Specifically , participant rest chair , watch portion child-friendly movie seat chair , color color book seat chair . Each activity last 5 minute 2 minute rest occur activity . - Participants complete series walk bout treadmill physical activity oxygen uptake concurrently assess . The walking bout start 0.5 mile per hour end 5 mile per hour ( 0.5 mile per hour increment ) . Treadmill test stop participant finish bout naturally select jog/run , follow completion last bout 5.0 mile per hour , whichever occur first . A 2 minute rest occur treadmill bout . - Participants complete three additional free-living activity physical activity oxygen uptake continue concurrently measure . Specifically , participant step aerobic step 88 beat per minute , dribble basketball , perform jump jack 126 beat per minute ( 63 jumping jack per minute ) . Each activity last 5 minute 2 minute rest occur activity .</detailed_description>
