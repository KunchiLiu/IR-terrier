	<brief_summary>This research study do see whether losartan prevent decrease strength associate age . Muscle loss associate age multiple symptom weakness , slowness , fatigue ( tiredness ) . Older adult muscle weakness high risk fall disability . In addition , loss independence old adult lead poor quality life . Recently , discover losartan , medication commonly use treat high blood pressure , slow strength decline see old mouse . In addition , allow injured mouse skeletal muscle heal faster . Therefore , would like see losartan old adult . Losartan approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment high blood pressure , heart failure , protect kidney diabetic patient . Losartan FDA-approved prevent decrease strength associate age . In study , participant age 70 old ask take losartan placebo see losartan help prevent loss muscle strength . A placebo substance look like study drug contains active ingredient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Muscle Strength Maintenance Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The loss independence old adult among costly disturb event life span . This loss often influenced multiple etiology , include medical neurological condition , cognitive decline , non-supportive social/environmental setting frailty . Frailty syndrome multi-systemic , age-related decline characterize weakness , weight loss , fatigue , low level activity , slowness . Frail old adult high risk adverse outcome include hospitalization , disability , mortality . Recently , Johns Hopkins University Older Americans Independence Center ( JHU OAIC ) investigator Burks Cohn find block angiotensin type 1 receptor losartan , angiotensin-receptor blocker ( ARB ) old mouse markedly accelerate injured skeletal muscle heal decrease vulnerability disuse atrophy strength decline . These finding provide potent rationale test hypothesis losartan attenuate strength decline other-frailty related measure old adult . To prepare test hypothesis , phase 2 randomize , placebo control pilot clinical trial losartan prefrail adult age 70 propose aim ass safety tolerability , estimate dosing range , estimate treatment effect use inter- intra-subject variability potential outcome measure . Losartan medication commonly utilized old adult treatment hypertension generally well tolerated condition cardiovascular condition . The study take place 24 week Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) Hopkins Bayview Medical Campus , 24 pre-frail subject recruit OAIC frailty registry . Successful completion study provide safety , dose , outcome measure data necessary design pivotal study need determine long term treatment losartan significantly improve frailty related skeletal muscle phenotype . Interventions , losartan , prevent decline see frailty potential improve function help older adult maintain independence . This utmost importance maintain good quality-of-life older adult .</detailed_description>
