	<brief_summary>The investigator hop introduce novel MRI contrast agent SeeMore ™ directly define viable myocardium . Identifying viable myocardium non-invasively use cardiac MRI still move target question plan answer definitively SeeMore ™ contrast . Though well test small large animal Phase I &amp; II clinical trial , investigator would like determine efficacy SeeMore contrast clinical setting . SeeMore new manganese ( Mn ) -based intravenous image agent develop enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . While Mn long know desirable magnetic kinetic property MRI , use human initially possible due cardiovascular depression electrocardiogram ( ECG ) change , include prolongation PR QTc interval , associate intravenous administration [ 1-5 ] . SeeMore provide Mn form maintains desire magnetic kinetic property overcome cardiovascular toxicity Mn . SeeMore take heart cell ( primarily via addition calcium avoid cardiotoxic effect ; please refer US patent # 5,980,863 ) . The potential distinguish healthy heart tissue unhealthy heart tissue base specific sustained pattern enhancement provide basis evaluate performance SeeMore heart patient . It may possible enhance utility MRI heart disease use image agent specifically take heart cell . SeeMore cardiac-specific agent develop purpose . Unlike nuclear perfusion agent , SeeMore radioactive require special handling , shield , transport storage . In addition , specific pattern enhancement achieve heart muscle persists time , offer potential benefit nonspecific extracellular agent currently available MRI X-ray/CT procedure . This feature allow full use high resolution MRI , since trade-off high spatial resolution temporal ( first-pass ) resolution . It anticipate feature offer SeeMore along high resolution , three dimensional attribute MRI result high accuracy available current modality practice , include stress echocardiogram , cardiac MRI use gadolinium contrast nuclear study SPECT PET . This evaluate study serve basis pivotal registration study . All component SeeMore™ USP approve use drug man , orally and/or intravenously .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label , baseline-controlled study . An initial cohort study patient conduct safety evaluation conduct proceeding additional patient . In initial cohort , patient dose base Phase 1 2 clinical trial data evaluation complete Eagle Vision Pharmaceutical , Inc . Starting 30 minute cardiac MRI scan ( CMR ) , subject take 4 mg tablet ondansetron mouth . CMR subsequently take place SeeMore™ administer approximately 15 minute scan contrast enhance image . SeeMore™ administer intravenously approximately one minute . The subject receive 0.28 mL/kg SeeMore™ . All subject monitor closely ondansetron administration discharge image center . If positive delayed-enhanced MRI detect , subject undergo MEMRI within 1 week . The investigator plan perform image CMR SeeMore™ within week standard gadolinium-based delayed enhance image CMR ( perform clinically indicate within Stanford Hospital patient 's physician ) directly compare two different contrast enhance image ( SeeMore v Gadolinium determine viable myocardium ) . Parameters Measured : A standard physical examination perform within 24 hour prior dose end experimental MEMRI imaging ( approximately 1 hour post dosing ) . A standard 12-lead EKG perform experimental MR study experimental MR study assure significant EKG change occur . HR measure study . After study , patient another standard 12-lead EKG perform compare pre-MRI 12-lead EKG . The patient 's symptom reassess 1 hour 1 year infusion SeeMore contrast . Adverse event ( AEs ) discomforts record discharge image center . Any clinically relevant change baseline vital sign , ECG rhythm , clinical chemistry physical condition AEs follow resolution outcome know . Primary efficacy base determine whether heart normal abnormal abnormal whether infarction , ischemia . This provide basis calculate sensitivity , specificity , accuracy predictive value . In addition , location , size , conspicuity associate confidence disease record . The study stop significant adverse cardiovascular event include cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , ventricular arrhythmia , ICD firing , congestive heart failure , hospitalization , syncope .</detailed_description>
