	<brief_summary>The author hypothesize adjust individual feeding ( AIF ) preterm infant start transition oral feeding ( 33 week correct age ) result less episodes apnea/bradycardia , early achievement full oral feeding , improve weight gain shorten hospitalization duration short term . In long term AIF result high score Griffith 's developmental scale , decrease parental anxiety feed disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preterm infant bear &lt; 32 week gestation institute qualify study . Recruitment occur day 7-14 life sever brain malformation intraventricular bleeding rule . Randomization control intervention via sealed envelope . In control group - infant treat accord common practice neonatal intensive care unit . Transition oral feeding occur 33 wkks ( breast feeding ) 34 wks ( bottle feeding ) . Meals give every 3 hour , amount write care give physician write strict number ( i.e 30 ml every 3 hour ) Parents intervention group teach nurse ( NIDCAP trainee ) identify infant ' ques ( self regulation withdrawn well sign hunger ) , This parent teach physiology maturation feeding , well various technique infant feed amongst pace feeding . During study parent group interview every 14 day satisfaction , anxiety , infant ability cope . video type Kangaroo care 32 35 wks well feed 35 week do evaluate . General movement assessment ( neurodevelopment ) do 33 -35 week gestational age , well 52 week . Alberta infant motor scale evaluate 4 8 month correct age , Automated Brain stem evoke Response ( ABR ) do 33 wks assessment brain stem maturity , duration hospitalization , weight gain per week 33 , 34 35 week calculate , age full oral feeding note .
