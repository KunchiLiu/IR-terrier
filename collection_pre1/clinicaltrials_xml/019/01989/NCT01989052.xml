	<brief_summary>This Phase 1/2 study combination CTO lomustine patient recurrent malignant glioma treat Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center ( PRTBTC ) Duke . The Primary Objectives : - Phase 1 : To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) CTO combine lomustine among patient recurrent malignant glioma ( World Health Organization ( WHO ) grade III IV ) previously treat bevacizumab . - Phase 2 : To assess efficacy CTO ( either monotherapy combination lomustine ) compare lomustine alone patient recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma previously treat bevacizumab base upon 6-month progression free survival ( PFS6 ) . Note : This study terminate early due funding issue . At time termination , study still Phase 1 MTD combination CTO lomustine determine population . Phase 2 proceed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph 1/2 CTO With Lomustine Bevacizumab-Naive Recurrent Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase 1 component study , conduct dose-escalation study combination CTO lomustine among patient recurrent malignant glioma ( WHO grade III IV ) . All patient bevacizumab-naïve . The dose escalation standard `` 3+3 '' design determine MTD CTO combination lomustine . The Phase 2 portion study randomize screen study compare CTO alone ( Arm A ) versus CTO lomustine ( Arm B ) versus lomustine alone ( Arm C ) patient recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma bevacizumab-naïve . Subjects randomized treatment arm allocation ratio 2:2:1 . Based result patient already take part Phase 1 study , Principal Investigator decide reduce dose lomustine use combination CTO study 25 % FDA-approved dose , due hematologic side effect ( side effect relate low expect blood count ) . Therefore , dose lomustine receive combination CTO approximately 75 % standard recommend dose . Note : This study terminate early due funding issue . At time termination , study still Phase 1 MTD combination CTO lomustine determine population . Phase 2 proceed .</detailed_description>
