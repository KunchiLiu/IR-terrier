	<brief_summary>Recent study show BCG vaccination reduces neonatal mortality 40 % . This effect explain prevention tuberculosis , rare among infant . The protective effect BCG vaccination see already within first week . It seem BCG provide non-specific beneficial immune modulation - thereby reduce overall mortality . Mortality high among newborn admit neonatal intensive care unit . If BCG immediate beneficial effect immune system , vaccinate child BCG early possible may save life . The investigator test hypothesis randomize trial among newborns Guinea-Bissau , randomize newborn admit neonatal intensive care unit National Hospital 1:1 BCG immediately discharge ( usual practice ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Providing BCG Vaccination Immediately</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational study high-mortality area show BCG vaccine associate mark benefit child survival . These result explain prevention tuberculosis , rare first year life . These observation recently test Bandim Health Project ( BHP ) Guinea-Bissau randomized trial among low birth weight ( LBW , &lt; 2500 g ) child . According local practice , BCG typically postpone LBW infant 4-6 week age . Results show provide BCG time discharge hospital compare BCG later reduce neonatal mortality 40 % . The protective effect start already within first three day . Based verbal autopsy , BCG protect child neonatal septicemia pneumonia . Recent immunological study indicate BCG induces epigenetic change reprogram innate immune system increase pro-inflammatory response unrelated pathogen ; hence , BCG may indeed non-specific beneficial effect protect infection . BCG recommend birth World Health Organization ( WHO ) , rarely give immediately birth . In Guinea-Bissau , National Hospital 's maternity ward , child currently vaccinate discharge . For child bear healthy , usually mean 1-2 day delivery . However , small child ill child admit neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) , often stay day week discharge - receive BCG time discharge . The mortality among child NICU alarmingly high - 14 % ( 254/1877 ) among child admit NICU November 2007 May 2013 ( unpublished data ) . A substantial number child die normal birth weight high Apgar score . In case underlie cause death infectious disease , could potentially affected BCG vaccination . Hence , present aim conduct randomize trial NICU study effect provide BCG immediately ( intervention group ) versus BCG discharge ( control group ) . The primary outcome mortality hospital stay , cause death , growth length stay secondary outcome . HYPOTHESIS Providing BCG vaccination upon admission newborn child NICU incubator , rather discharge , associate 40 % reduction mortality NICU child weigh &gt; 1250 g. METHODS Setting The randomized trial conduct Bandim Health Project Guinea-Bissau , NICU National Hospital Sim√£o Mendes . The Bandim Health Project ( BHP ) maintain health demographic surveillance system ( HDSS ) six suburban district capital Guinea-Bissau cover approximately 102,000 inhabitant . All house study area visit monthly register new pregnancy birth . All child 3 year age follow home visit every third month . The National Hospital many woman study area give birth kilometer away . The BHP work hospital 's maternity ward many year , conduct trial different health intervention observational study reduce infant mortality . Study design Children randomly allocate ( 1:1 ) BCG admission discharge ( per current standard care ) . Enrolment procedures The BHP team present maternity ward every day . The team visit NICU identify child admit since last visit . The mother study explain local language ( Portuguese Creole ) , also receive write explanation Portuguese . She briefly interviewed background factor ( education , previous delivery , etc. ) . Anthropometric measure obtain Ballard score assess trained nurse . Randomization Provided consent , mother draw lot indicate child receive BCG immediately BCG discharge usual . To ensure equal distribution different category child calendar time , randomization do block within two group child ; ) child NICU incubator ( severely ill ) ; b ) child NICU incubator ( less ill , include also child bear caesarean section whose mother indispose ) . Randomization stratify sex weight group ( 1250-1499g , 1500-1999g , 2000-2499g , 2500+ g ) block 16 . Intervention Immediately randomization , child allocate BCG vaccine vaccinate intradermally 0.05 ml BCG vaccine ( Statens Serum Institute , Denmark ) . The control group receive BCG discharge . All child receive oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) time BCG vaccination . The study therefore test BCG+OPV admission NICU ( intervention arm ) vs. BCG+OPV discharge NICU ( control arm ) . Same-sex twin pair receive treatment . Blinding The BHP team charge randomization vaccination . These procedure take place without participation NICU staff . BCG vaccination leave small mark skin child , vanishes quickly , leave sign papule form several week later . To ensure blind hospital staff , small gauze patch place injection site group , entire hospital stay . Follow-up -At hospital The BHP team visit NICU every day ascertain vital status enrol child plaster remove . All clinical biological parameter register NICU staff , include weight , temperature respiratory frequency also record . The main outcome survival stay NICU . -After discharge At day discharge , BHP team assure child randomise control group receive BCG OPV leave hospital . The child discharge offer transport home . All include child include Bissau follow adverse event , survival , growth morbidity home visit 3 day , 2 month , 6 month 12 month age . -Statistical analysis The mortality data analyze Cox proportional hazard model . Due expect high number twin , analysis adjust interdependency twin . We analyze overall effect BCG survival , cause death . Length stay weight gain discharge among survive child analyze use linear regression . To prevent bias could arise BCG particularly beneficial survival among small child , control intervention child match base birth weight , pair child one child die exclude analysis . There natural variation time birth enrolment trial . All analysis adjust time birth enrolment . All analysis conduct stratified weight group , sex season ( dry ( Dec-May ) v rainy ( June-Nov ) ) , since previously observe factor may modify response BCG vaccine . It secondary hypothesis early effect strong boy dry season . Public health campaign also affect newborn child , example polio vaccination campaign , could interfere trial . If campaign implement also child ICU , child censor analysis time intervention . Likewise strike , shortage electricity event interfere health service , child censor analysis discussion DSMB . -Sample size The NICU admit around 350-400 child per year place incubator . Around 94 % weigh 1250 g. The median length stay 6 day . With mortality 12 % , would need enroll 1262 child detect 40 % difference mortality BCG-vaccinated BCG-unvaccinated child 80 % power significance level 5 % . This correspond 122 death . If mortality decline ( do last year BHP study area ) , event number would slightly high ; mortality 11 % would need continue 123 death maintain power ; decline 10 % would 124 death , etc . Based data , investigator expect reach need number event period 4 year , take account child die enrolled child ill enrol . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study protocol approve The Danish Central Ethical Committee National Ethical Committee Guinea-Bissau . The trial register clinicaltrials.gov . In previous study BCG safe LBW child even beneficial among small child . A local clinical monitor Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) appoint .</detailed_description>
