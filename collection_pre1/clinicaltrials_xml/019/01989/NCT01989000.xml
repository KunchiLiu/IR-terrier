Study design : The target population recruit Academic Medical Centre ( AMC ) Erasmus MC . First , ass reproducibility , patient pancreatic cancer undergo MRI twice , AMC EMC . Next , 40 consecutive patient undergo surgery+adjuvant treatment MRI 18F-HX4-PET/CT measurement ass value technique predict outcome standard treatment . 40 patient undergo preoperative radiochemotherapy MRI 18F-HX4-PET/CT baseline , 1 week surgery . We assess relative contribution image method well integrate use method predictive marker survival pathological response treatment . Tumor tissue resect patient analyzed marker tumor vascularization ( CD31 , VEGF ) , hypoxia ( HIF1alfa , GLUT1 , CA9 ) , stromal activation ( smooth muscle actin , marker Hedgehog pathway activity ) . Results correlate image parameter , well patient outcome .</detailed_description>
