Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving booster vaccination may make strong immune response prevent delay recurrence cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Booster Vaccination Preventing Disease Recurrence Previously Vaccinated Patients With Melanoma That Has Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity booster vaccination gp100 ( gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide vaccine ) human papilloma virus ( HPV ) peptides Montanide ISA 51 Montanide ISA 51 VG administer &gt; = 12 month last immunization . II . To measure T-cell response modify gp100 : 209-217 ( 210M ) peptide unmodified native gp100 peptide follow booster vaccination &gt; = 12 month last immunization . III . To measure T-cell response control human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A2 restrict cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8 epitope papilloma virus HPV16E7:12-20 follow booster vaccination &gt; = 12 month last immunization . IV . To perform detailed study memory T cell persist &gt; = 12 month immunization . OUTLINE : Patients receive gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide vaccine HPV 16 E7:12-20 peptide vaccine Montanide ISA 51 VG Montanide ISA 51 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 day 25-30 . After 6 month , patient free disease receive booster injection every 6 month 3 year absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month , every 6 month 5 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
