	<detailed_description>Endometriosis common benign condition , affect woman reproductive age . The disorder characterize endometrial surface epithelium , endometrial gland stroma , find outside uterus anatomically ectopic site . - Laparoscopic excision disease frequently carry treatment severe endometriosis . Pelvic adhesion often develop follow surgery , restrict success treatment . Commercially available anti-adhesive solution often use successfully limit post-operative adhesion follow myomectomy surgery . - This study aim assess effect resorbable hydrogel anti-adhesive gel follow laparoscopic surgery severe pelvic endometriosis prevalence postoperative ovarian adhesion . - This prospective double blind randomize controlled trial patient severe pelvic endometriosis ( defined American Society Reproductive Medicine classification system ) require extensive laparoscopic dissection ( open one para-rectal space ) uterine ovarian preservation . - Disease severity eligibility inclusion study confirm surgery . - Pre-operatively , participant complete standardize symptom questionnaire detail presence intensity specific endometriosis symptom Intra-operatively ovary routinely elevate anterior abdominal wall use Prolene suture ( ovarian suspension ) facilitate operative access . At end procedure , participant randomize one ovary coat 4mls hydrogel anti-adhesive gel , ovary replace anatomically correct position . - Three month surgery , randomize patient transvaginal ultrasound scan ass ovarian mobility repeat symptom questionnaire . - Both patient person perform ultrasound scan blind randomization process .</detailed_description>
