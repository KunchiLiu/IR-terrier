	<brief_summary>This Phase I , five arm , single site , randomize , double blind placebo-controlled trial assess safety tenofovir vaginal gel film formulation . HIV negative woman randomize gel film , tenofovir placebo . This study provide additional information evaluation vaginal film contain microbial agent human . In addition safety , efficacy formulation HIV ex vivo biopsy challenge model compare . This study first study assess safety tenofovir film human . Tenofovir film formulate cellulose base vaginal film contain hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose ( HPMC ) E5 ( 5 cp ) , hydroxyethyl cellulose ( HEC ) , Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose ( NaCMC ) , glycerin . The excipients film document safety clinical setting . While tenofovir film study extensively preclinical study , favorable safety data macaque study substantial body research tenofovir gel . It appropriate advance tenofovir film product clinical trial follow reason : - No safety concern note tenofovir film macaque trial . - The toxicity tenofovir administer vaginally study extensively . No clinically significant toxicity associate route administration observe date . - All active ingredient tenofovir film test pre-clinical toxicity study ; therefore , influence ingredient toxicity profile tenofovir adequately evaluate show result local systemic effect . - The individual component tenofovir film adequately evaluate show safe .</brief_summary>
