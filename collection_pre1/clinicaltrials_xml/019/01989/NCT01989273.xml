	<brief_summary>This study patient admit major traumatic injury . Such patient may develop inadequate circulation organ result internal blood loss . Early detection internal blood loss difficult physical examination alone may miss patient significant blood loss . Some patient internal bleed arrive low blood pressure ; patient usually give 2 liter intravenous fluid determine blood pressure recover . If blood pressure rise drop later , blood loss assume severe , patient likely need transfusion , surgery intervention . However , fluid treatment method lead delay complication patient may initially respond continue bleed . The inferior vena cava ( IVC ) large vein drain blood low body heart . The inferior vena cava know empty patient significant blood loss . The vena cava diameter see use ultrasound . This study intend perform ultrasound examine vena cava diameter patient arrive major trauma . The hypothesis propose study ultrasound assessment protocol inferior vena cava diameter collapsibility detect aid management non-compressible hemorrhage major trauma victim . After patient give 2 liter intravenous fluid treatment , inferior vena cava diameter measure . A third examination 8-24 hour admission determine inferior vena cava diameter return normal . We propose measure inferior vena cava manner predict patient likely continue bleed require intervention surgery . Early detection patient may avoid delay treatment , complication excess mortality . Because examination do handheld ultrasound machine , could do outside hospital military combat casualty care .</brief_summary>
