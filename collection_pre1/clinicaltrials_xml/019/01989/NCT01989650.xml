	<brief_summary>Recent research suggest endoscopist fatigue may significantly affect polyp detection rate . There study intervention may reduce endoscopist fatigue therefore improve colonoscopy performance . We want determine whether break middle colonoscopy session would maintain stable adenoma detection rate</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Taking Break During Colonoscopy Session Adenoma Detection , Prospective , Randomized Control Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , dramatic increase volume endoscopic procedure perform endoscopy center . With grow awareness colorectal cancer screening , increase demand colonoscopy increase workload endoscopists every healthcare system . There study show physician fatigue impairs quality care performance medical specialty anesthesia surgery . Colonoscopy nature repetitive frequently prolong promote distractibility fatigability . Studies western country show afternoon colonoscopy associate low adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) compare morning colonoscopy physician fatigue hypothesize potential contributor . Previous study also show polyp detection rate decrease hour-by-hour throughout day colonoscopy completion rate appear decline successive procedure due endoscopist fatigue . The recent study use queue position surrogate marker endoscopist fatigue show later colonoscopy start time increase number precede endoscopic procedure associate decrease polyp detection rate . It surprising endoscopist fatigue may contribute significant decline effectiveness colonoscopy yet probably realistic reduce number colonoscopy procedure per session give heavy clinical demand . There study intervention may improve performance colonoscopy . It would reasonable postulate take break half way colonoscopy session may alleviate endoscopist fatigue hence improve polyp detection rate . This study aim evaluate effect introduce break middle colonoscopy session quality colonoscopy performance .</detailed_description>
