	<brief_summary>Rivaroxaban develop various clinical setting , prevention venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) major orthopedic surgery , prevention stroke atrial fibrillation , treatment acute coronary syndrome . And , EINSTEIN-pulmonary embolism ( PE ) EINSTEIN-deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) program , rivaroxaban show non-inferior standard therapy treatment PE DVT . However , limited experience rivaroxaban secondary VTE prophylaxis cancer patient . Although cancer-associated DVT PE include previously mention EINSTEIN program , approximately 5 % total population cancer patient study . Thus , investigator could automatically translate result study real practice management cancer-associated VTE patient . Moreover , , new oral anticoagulant , include dabigatran rivaroxaban , compare long-term warfarin therapy , well-known inferior agent , low molecular weight heparin . In sense , investigator feel new oral anticoagulant , particularly rivaroxaban , re-investigated highly specific patient group . Therefore , investigator plan conduct prospective study evaluate efficacy safety rivaroxaban Korean patient cancer-associated VTE .</brief_summary>
