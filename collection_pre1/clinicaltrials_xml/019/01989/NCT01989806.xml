	<brief_summary>Evidences show patient suffer spinal cord injury ( SCI ) poor mobility high chance develop cardiopulmonary disease , lead poor quality life short life expectancy . Different modality develop aim mobility restoration SCI patient robotic assist body weight support treadmill train one late technique recent year . Yet scarce study investigate effectiveness . The purpose study investigate effectiveness robotic-assisted body weight support treadmill train mobility cardiopulmonary function patient suffer SCI randomize control trial . 80 patient suffer incomplete SCI recruit 8-week training program . They randomize either robotic assist body weight support treadmill train group passive low limb mobilization train group . The training effect measure Walking Index Spinal Cord Injury version II , low extremity motor score , low limb Modified Ashworth Scale , robotic gait system , gait analysis gas analysis sub maximal exercise stress test . Through study , intent find effectiveness robotic-assisted body weight support treadmill train walk cardiopulmonary recovery patient suffer incomplete spinal cord injury . The hypothesis study : Compared control group , robotic-assisted body weight support treadmill train lead great improvement walk ability cardiopulmonary functioning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants recruit spinal cord rehabilitation unit Physiotherapy Department Kowloon Hospital . Subjects allocate intervention group control group use seal envelope blind group allocation . All participant undergo standard physiotherapy program , include mobilization strengthen exercise limb , trunk stabilization training , wheelchair maneuver training overground walk training . Based standard train program twice per week , 60 minute per session , participant receive additional 30 minute ( exclude set-up time ) robotic-assisted body weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) control train base group allocation 3 time 8 week . Outcome measure collect intervention subject reassess finish 8 week intervention . Outcome measure include Walking Index Spinal Cord Injury version II , Spinal Cord Independence Measure version III , low extremity motor score , Modified Ashworth Scale , L-stiff L-force measure Lokomat system , VO2 maximum , spirometry , gait analysis ( walk speed , heel-heel base support , bilateral stance duration , bilateral symmetry ) The result study provide useful information enhance clinical effectiveness management spinal cord injury use robotic assist body weight support treadmill training .</detailed_description>
