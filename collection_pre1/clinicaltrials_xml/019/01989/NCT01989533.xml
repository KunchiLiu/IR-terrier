	<brief_summary>Background : - Vaccines create resistance disease . This study test experimental human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) vaccine use adenovirus transporter . Transporters may help vaccine stimulate immune response HIV . This mean body work fight infection . Researchers want see different way give vaccine cause different immune response . They also want see vaccine adenovirus contagious . Adenoviruses cause cold symptom mild eye infection . Participants get HIV vaccine . But get adenovirus , entire household intimate contact must participate . Objective : - To test safety experimental HIV vaccine . Eligibility : - Healthy adult 18 49 year old . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . - Participants receive vaccine 3 time 6 month . Each time , physical exam blood urine test . Samples take nose , rectum , cervix . - Some participant receive vaccine swallow 11 capsule water . Clinic staff observe 1 hour . - Some participant receive vaccine swab throat . They get dose 1 hospital stay 1 week . They medical test nose swab . Doses 2 3 require hospital stay . - Participants 7 follow-up visit 6 month , physical exam blood test . Samples take nose , throat , rectum . - Household intimate contact 4 clinic visit 8 month , physical exam blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , single center , randomize , double-blind study design evaluate safety immunogenicity live , replication-competent recombinant Adenovirus type 4-HIV vaccine regimen . The oral route also contain placebo control . The vaccine candidate Ad4-mgag Ad4-EnvC150 formulate enteric-coated capsule deliver orally , aqueous formulation intranasal administration . Determining optimal regimen route greatly accelerate investigation vector HIV vaccine platform . Participants volunteer receive vaccine orally randomize 1 4 treatment arm , volunteer receive vaccine via intranasal route randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Participants receive either 1 vaccine placebo , depend group assignment . The study vaccine administer participant 3 round vaccination 0 , 2 , 6 month . All participant receive booster vaccination bivalent HIV gp120 glycoprotein 8 month . Intranasal vaccine recipient receive first vaccine NIH Special Clinical Studies Unit appropriate unit follow inpatient basis allow respiratory isolation . Beginning 4 day vaccination , participant test daily respiratory shed Ad4 nasopharyngeal wash . They discharge home close monitoring Day 7 2 consecutive negative wash , whichever come first ; may remain unit longer medically necessary . Prior receive second dose vaccine outpatient basis , seroconversion Ad4 confirm intranasal vaccine recipient . Those seroconverted continue receive subsequent dose inpatient show seroconversion . Alternatively , may withdraw study replace . Oral capsule recipient vaccinate discharged home . In addition clinical laboratory monitoring safety , principal assessment shed virus rectal , cervicovaginal , throat , nasal swab , assessment antibody ( mucosal systemic ) response HIV Ad4 virus . The candidate vaccine also administer 2 group participant previously receive unrelated HIV vaccine another clinical study and/or Ad4 seropositive . The aim group explore boost potential enteric coat capsule aqueous formulation Ad4-mgag Ad4- EnvC150 vaccine give subject previously receive another HIV vaccine and/or Ad4 seropositive . All participant follow total 14 month . Household intimate contact also enrol monitor Adenovirus HIV antibodies 8 month .</detailed_description>
