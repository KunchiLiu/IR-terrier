	<brief_summary>The study address two primary question , accord factorial design : - compare efficacy term overall survival ( OS ) peri-operative vs. post-operative chemotherapy ( CHT ) treatment , irrespectively presence post-surgical chemo-radiotherapy ( CHT-RTX ) ( Timing Study ) ; - compare efficacy term relapse free survival ( l-RFS ) post-surgical CHT-RTX treatment vs. treatment , irrespectively time CHT ( RTX Study ) . The study 2x2 factorial design , thus consist two independent , follow specific eligibility criterion different randomization scheme study , Timing Study RTX Study . Both study Italian , multicentre , open-label , randomize , superiority , phase III trial conduct patient histologically confirm , localize gastric adenocarcinoma , consider operable . In Timing Study patient fulfil eligibility criterion randomize 1:1 ratio receive : - peri-operative CHT ( Arm A ) - post-operative CHT ( Arm B ) Once randomize Timing Study , patient may also randomize RTX Study receive addition CHT post-operative CHT-RTX treatment treatment . This possible since randomization do two step : first Timing Study participate centre ( peri-operative CHT vs. post-operative CHT ) second one RTX Study , centre radiotherapist willing able participate ( post- surgical CHT-RTX vs. treatment ) . Thus follow four arm generate : - peri-operative CHT ( Arm A ) - post-operative CHT ( Arm B ) - peri-operative CHT + post-operative CHT-RTX ( Arm C ) - post-operative CHT + post-operative CHT-RTX ( Arm D ) The study conduct one hundred experimental centre . Follow-up F ( -up ) procedures time visit consistent current clinical practice . Based case-mix sample 1000-1180 patient need Timing study 420-520 RTX study .</brief_summary>
