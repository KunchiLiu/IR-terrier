	<brief_summary>Patients heart failure report low level hydrogen sulfide blood , even though sulfur available naturally diet . Hydrogen sulfide molecule show number beneficial effect thus low level may contribute disease . This trial test whether medical food product synthetic sulfur molecule , SG1002 , overcome deficit blood level hydrogen sulfide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Safety Ability SG1002 Overcome Deficits Hydrogen Sulfide Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects heart failure show deficit circulate hydrogen sulfide level , , since sulfur readily bioavailable decline food substance , treat adequately diet alone . This deficit circulate hydrogen sulfide think lead increase oxidative stress , associate problem contribute heart failure . This study evaluate safety ability multiple dose oral SG1002 subject heart failure reverse deficit circulate hydrogen sulfide . The primary objective ass safety ability multiple dos twice daily administration SG1002 compare placebo increase circulating level hydrogen sulfide . Initially , dose escalation study carry 21 day 4 normal subject , randomize 3:1 active : placebo . Subjects receive 200 mg dose BID 7 day adverse event , escalate 400 mg 7 day 800 mg 7 day . Safety parameter assess dose , along pharmacokinetic analysis marker oxidative stress heart failure . Following completion normal healthy subject , 10 heart failure subject randomize 4:1 active : placebo test described .</detailed_description>
