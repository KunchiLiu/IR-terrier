	<brief_title>Etanercept Vascular Function Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis chronic disease mainly affect skin . The common form psoriasis , plaque psoriasis , appear anywhere body , commonly find elbow , knee , scalp , low back . Skin typically become red inflamed may form scaly patch . While psoriasis may look like skin disease , fact result overacting , malfunction immune system . One consequence dysfunction over-activity substance call tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) . TNF alter body 's immune response promote inflammation . High TNF activity associate psoriasis many disease immune system . There multiple treatment psoriasis range topical medication include steroid cream , coal tar extract , exposure UV light . For moderate severe disease , drug change immune system work sometimes use . One drug Etanercept , prescription medicine approve FDA treatment moderate severe plaque psoriasis . Etanercept work reduce amount TNF body thereby reduce inflammation keep skin clearer . Inflammation appear skin patient psoriasis , recent research show abnormal inflammation play role development disease blood vessel call atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis build-up plaque within artery body cause gradual narrowing occasionally rupture cause angina ( chest pain ) , heart attack , stroke , peripheral vascular disease . Many traditional risk factor atherosclerosis ( include high blood pressure , diabetes , smoke ) associate increased inflammation . These risk factor also increase production certain molecule call reactive oxygen specie . Too many reactive oxygen specie molecules result condition call oxidative stress . Oxidative stress lead abnormal function cell line blood vessel , call endothelial cell , process promotes inflammation within blood vessel . Over time , lead irreversible damage heart blood vessel . To counteract damage , body produce endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) bone marrow . The EPCs help balance damage occur blood vessel oxidative stress harmful process . Several drug commonly use heart disease recently show improve EPCs function . This balance oxidative stress , inflammation , EPCs immune system complex fully understood . Drugs like Etanercept modify inflammatory response immune system useful therapy diseases like psoriasis , help expand understand inflammation arthrosclerosis . The investigator plan measure health vascular system subject take Etanercept treatment plaque psoriasis . To , plan take blood sample check cardiovascular risk factor , inflammation level , oxidative stress level , EPCs . The investigator also measure well artery relax ultrasound ( non-invasive test ) . Because want measure effect Etanercept blood vessel subject take Etanercept 3 month placebo injection 3 month check ultrasound blood test end cycle . Subjects study individual would eligible receive Etanercept current FDA use guideline ( psoriasis ) . Our interest potential effect drug vascular system . By perform study hope good understand interplay vascular disease , inflammation immune system . If drug modulate inflammatory response cause change vascular function , would important step towards possible new avenue treatment cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
