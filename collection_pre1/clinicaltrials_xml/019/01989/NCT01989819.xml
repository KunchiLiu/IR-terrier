	<brief_summary>Primary Sjögren syndrome ( pSS ) inflammatory , autoimmune , multiorgan disease often involve central peripheral nervous system . Fifteen twenty percent patient primary Sjögren 's syndrome neurological complication involve peripheral nervous system . Although patient large fiber neuropathy , around forty percent patient Sjögren 's syndrome experience neuropathic pain normal electrodiagnostic study . Although patient may diagnose fibromyalgia depressive symptom , show small fiber neuropathy ( SFN ) . A recent study prove 90 % pSS patient neuropathic pain SFN { Fauchais , 2010 # 188 } . The aim study investigate occurrence small fiber neuropathy patient pSS neuropathic pain normal electromyographic study determine existence conjoint local inflammatory process mediate cellular , cytokinic auto-antibody response . Quantification epidermal nerve fiber density skin biopsy valuable tool diagnose small fiber neuropathy method widely validate . A skin biopsy perform patient control allow quantification small fiber density skin sample along measurement sweat gland innervation . Moreover , pathophysiological study carry order evaluate causal relationship cellular humoral inflammation small fiberneuropathy . Recent study point inconstant efficacy corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug pSS-related SFN . Dissecting molecular mechanism small fiber neuropathy patient may help design new therapeutic strategy .</brief_summary>
