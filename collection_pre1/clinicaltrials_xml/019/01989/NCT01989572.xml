	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study sargramostim ( Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , GM-CSF ) vaccine therapy alone see well work compare sargramostim vaccine therapy together prevent disease recurrence patient locally advanced stage IV melanoma remove surgery . Sargramostim may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know whether yeast derive sargramostim vaccine therapy effective alone together prevent recurrence melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival recurrence-free survival patient completely resect stage IV melanoma stage III melanoma gross extranodal extension , satellite , and/or intransit lesion , treat granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) ( sargramostim ) vs. GM-CSF , high risk patient list eligibility section . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare , use 2 x 2 factorial design , overall survival recurrence-free survival human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A2 positive patient treat peptide vaccination vs. peptide vaccination . II . The following descriptive evaluation survival recurrence-free survival plan HLA-A2 positive patient : ( 1 ) GM-CSF plus peptide vaccination vs. peptide vaccination alone ; ( 2 ) GM-CSF plus peptide vaccination vs. GM-CSF alone ; ( 3 ) GM-CSF plus peptide vaccination vs. placebo . III . Survival recurrence-free survival HLA-A2 positive patient receive peptide vaccination compare HLA-A2 negative patient receive peptide vaccination . IV . To determine influence GM-CSF circulating dendritic cell number subpopulation peripheral blood patient receive receive GM-CSF . V. To determine , HLA-A2 positive patient , whether immunization peptide without GM-CSF elicits measurable T-cell response assess enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ( ELISPOT ) major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) tetramer assay , determine functionality cell intracellular cytokine staining . OUTLINE : After patient screen HLA-A2 positivity , patient would categorize two group : HLA-A2 positive patient HLA-A2 negative patient . HLA-A2 positive patient randomize 1 4 treatment regimen ( Arms I-IV ) . HLA-A2 negative patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( Arms V-VI ) . ARM I : Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-14 peptide vaccine comprise tyrosinase , gp100 antigen , melanoma antigen recognize T-cells 1 ( MART-1 ) mix either incomplete Freund 's adjuvant Montanide ISA-51 VG subcutaneously day 1 15 ( course 1 ) day 1 ( course 2 subsequent course ) . ARM II : Patients receive sargramostim placebo SC day 1-14 peptide vaccine comprise tyrosinase , gp100 antigen , MART-1 antigen mix either incomplete Freund 's adjuvant Montanide ISA-51 VG subcutaneously day 1 15 ( course 1 ) day 1 ( course 2 subsequent course ) . ARM III : Patients receive sargramostim SC day 1-14 peptide placebo mix either incomplete Freund 's adjuvant Montanide ISA-51 VG subcutaneously day 1 15 ( course 1 ) day 1 ( course 2 subsequent course ) . ARM IV : Patients receive sargramostim placebo SC day 1-14 peptide placebo mix either incomplete Freund 's adjuvant Montanide ISA-51 VG subcutaneously day 1 15 ( course 1 ) day 1 ( course 2 subsequent course ) . ARM V : Patients receive sargramostim SC day 1-14 . ARM VI : Patients receive sargramostim placebo SC day 1-14 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In event recurrence , patient undergo complete resection recurrence may continue treatment 6 course completion 1 year therapy ( whichever longer ) . For patient recurrence surgically resectable experience second recurrence , treatment discontinue . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month 15 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : 800 patient</detailed_description>
