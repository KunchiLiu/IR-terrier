	<brief_title>Evaluation Immediate v. Delayed CT/NG Test Treatment ED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial patient age 18 old treat clinician order CT/NG test . Clinicians approach research assistant ED ask whether CT/NG swab order CT/NG differential diagnosis . Then , potentially eligible patient approach asked consent enroll . For patient consent , simple randomization procedure ( i.e . random number generator ) use assign patient either immediate test result delay test result . Typically , ED test order diagnostic rather screen purpose ( symptoms vaginal discharge , abdominal pain , etc ) . Patients randomize batched test Roche AMPLICOR CT/NG ( standard care , control group ) immediate test clinical specimen Cepheid CT/NG real-time result reporting ( within 90 minute ) treat clinician ED . Patient interview clinician survey conduct ascertain perception illness test . A follow interview conduct patient determine clinical public health outcome . A validation Cepheid CT/NG test conduct hospital standard care &lt; /= 40 pilot participant . Pilot participant ask provide 2 endocervical swab urine specimen . All survey interview conduct pilot patient . While many outcome measure study , investigator power study reduce overtreatment rate antibiotic . Assuming baseline overtreatment rate 88 % ( # treat antibiotics/ # without disease ) , reduce rate 50 % ( 44 % ) , power 80 % alpha 0.05 , investigator need enroll 42 patient ( 21 control 21 study patient ) negative test . Given estimate positive rate 6 % , approximately 50 % patient receive test reason treat empirically antibiotic , investigator think enrol total 70 patient full data ( enrollment survey , clinician survey , follow survey ) would sufficient identify trend subject matter . Due sensitive nature subject matter high percentage lost-to-follow ED patient , investigator estimate approximately 50 % incomplete data . Therefore , investigator request enroll 150 patient study .</detailed_description>
