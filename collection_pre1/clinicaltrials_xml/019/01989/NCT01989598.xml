	<brief_title>Trametinib Akt Inhibitor GSK2141795 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate antitumor activity trametinib determine overall response rate ( ORR ) patient stratify group base : biomarker positive ( neuroblastoma RAS viral [ v-ras ] oncogene homolog [ NRAS ] , v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [ KRAS ] , v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 [ BRAF ] mutate ) biomarker negative ( without NRAS , KRAS , BRAF mutation ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) duration response ( DOR ) two stratified group . II . To document ORR addition GSK2141795 ( Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 ) trametinib patient develop progressive disease achieve less partial response ( PR ) 4 cycle treatment . III . To evaluate PFS DOR patient receive trametinib plus GSK2141795 . IV . To evaluate safety profile trametinib without GSK2141795 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore relationship clinical response pharmacodynamic ( PD ) marker . II . To explore relationship v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog ( MAF ) expression determine quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) , chromosomal abnormality detect florescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) , clinical response . III . To explore role integrin beta7 biomarker MAF expression . IV . To explore relationship objective clinical response well progressive disease tumor mutational profile . V. To explore mechanism phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) /v-akt Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene Homolog 1 ( AKT ) retrovirus-associated deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) sequence ( RAS ) -mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) -mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( ERK ) activation correlate clinical response PD marker . IV . To explore feasibility extract circulate free tumor DNA ( cfDNA ) peripheral blood detect RAS RAF mutation use cfDNA . OUTLINE : Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progressive disease achieve less PR 4 course may also receive Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO daily day 1-28 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
