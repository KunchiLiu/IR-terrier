	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study side effect well give induction therapy bortezomib dexamethasone follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) compare ASCT alone treat patient newly diagnose renal AL amyloidosis . In prospective , randomize control study , patient newly diagnose AL amyloidosis meet criterion ASCT randomize receive 2 cycle BD induction therapy follow ASCT ( BD+ASCT ) ( arm 1 ) receive ASCT alone initial treatment ( arm 2 ) . Hematologic organ response evaluate every 3 month ASCT . All patient follow 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Dexamethasone Followed ASCT Compared With ASCT Alone Treating Patients With AL Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arm 1 : The BD regimen include bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 i.v . dexamethasone 40 mg p.o . day 1 , 4 , 8 11 21 day cycle . This process repeat 2 cycle . After two cycle BD therapy , collection peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) complete within 4 week . Recommended dose drug follow : granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) 5-10ug/kg day 1-5 give , peripheral blood stem cell collect day 5-6 2Ã—10^6 CD34+ cell /kg . Patients receive ASCT therapy 8 week collection PBSC ( Recorded day 0 ) , melphalan ( day -2 ) dose 140 200 mg/m2 ( choose dose accord degree risk patient ) . Melphalan administer central venous catheter . Arm 2 : patient assign arm 2 receive ASCT alone initial treatment . The process ASCT arm 1 .</detailed_description>
