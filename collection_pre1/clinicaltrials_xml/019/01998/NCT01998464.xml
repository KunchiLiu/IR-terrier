	<brief_summary>Retinal vasculitis sight-threatening inflammation involve blood vessel retina , tissue line inside eye . This inflammation may occur result infectious , cancerous , inflammatory disorder . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) image technology perform non-contact cross-sectional image retinal choroidal tissue structure real time . It similar ultrasound imaging , except OCT measure intensity reflect light rather sound wave . The purpose study see non-invasive OCT technology diagnose retinal vasculitis well invasive fluorescein angiography , require injection dye vein arm patient . The study also compare map blood vessel ( angiography ) loss blood flow ( ischemia ) fluorescein angiography OCT .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis retinal vasculitis Inability give inform consent . Inability complete qualify study test within 30 day period date enrollment Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . A prior history reaction fluorescein dye . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g . unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , subject become eligible . Systemic antivascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) proVEGF treatment within 4 month prior treatment . Women childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 12 month due unknown safety fluorescein angiography . Prior panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) focal laser would alter macular perfusion retinovascular feature . Inability maintain stable fixation OCT imaging . Other ocular condition present , opinion investigator , may alter retinal perfusion . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , might affect alter visual acuity course study ( i.e . cataract ) Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line ( i.e . cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) . Media opacity otherwise would prevent either fixation ability obtain adequate image determine examiner . History major ocular surgery ( include vitrectomy , cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc ) within prior 4 month .</criteria>
