	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine feasibility early oral food intake postoperatively patient thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy . More evidence confirm role early early enteral nutrition ( NE ) esophagectomy patient esophageal cancer . Although enteral catheter feed show beneficial patient esophagectomy , preference modality also rest traditional undocumented reluctance allow food . These assume hazard allow normal food immediate postoperative period scientifically test viewed benefit side effect artificial feed modality . Whether early oral feed esophagectomy affect incidence life-threatening surgical complication , shorten recovery time bowel function postoperative hospital stay , improve postoperative quality life comparison artificial feeding modality remain unclear . The investigator compare routine allow liquid food first day surgery routine nil-by-mouth enteral nutrition first 7 postoperative day . The main endpoint incidence rate complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The literature conclude patient allow food without delay ( ) colorectal surgery customary withhold oral intake ( nil-by-mouth ) first postoperative day unnecessary . Robust data also suggest investigator avoid nil-by-mouth regimen major gynecologic , urologic , vascular surgery . The safety early oral feed esophagectomy investigate previously.In 2008 , result randomize multicenter clinical trial investigate whether routine allow normal food immediately increase morbidity major upper gastrointestinal surgery show allow patient eat normal food first day major upper gastrointestinal surgery increase morbidity compare traditional care nil-by-mouth enteral feeding . The assumed hazard allow oral food intake immediate postoperative period patient esophagectomy scientifically test viewed benefit side effect artificial feed modality . This randomized study investigate role early oral feeding patient esophagectomy.In early oral feed group nasogastric tube place routinely patient encourage intake liquid food postoperative day 1 ( POD1 ) . In delayed oral feed group patient receive isotonic saline nasoenteral feeding tube 20 mL/h morning POD 1 . Nutrition commence 20 mL/h . The rate increase 20 mL/h day tolerate , 80 mL/h . Esophagography perform postoperative day 7 . Sip water allow confirm absence anastomotic leakage , full liquid diet implement follow day enteral infusion halt . The complication define previous study bowel function recovery record carefully . The primary end point study postoperative complication secondary end point quality life , bowel function recovery time length postoperative stay two group . The investigator estimate minimum rate patient complication control group population 23 % . An increase 36 % consider clinically important . Detecting difference magnitude great level statistical significance 0.05 power 0.90 one-tailed test proportion require total 130 patient group.Considering rate drop-out total 280 patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
