	<detailed_description>ASA commonly drug use worldwide prevention cardiovascular disease . However , ASA increasingly recognize culprit small bowel bleeding . The latter condition manifest overt bleed ( i.e. , pass black bright red stool ) occult blood loss ( i.e. , normal stool progressive decrease hemoglobin level ) , normal finding stomach colon . Small bowel bleed notoriously difficult diagnose beyond reach conventional endoscopy . The advent wireless , video capsule endoscopy revolutionize visualization small bowel . Capsule endoscopy pill contain tiny camera capture picture small bowel swallow . Currently , capsule endoscopy recommend noninvasive approach identify source small bowel bleeding . The problem small bowel bleed increasingly recognize , partly use ASA rise . In regional hospital Hong Kong , diagnose 100 case ASA-associated small bowel overt bleeding/occult blood loss year . In prospective cohort study find among ASA user history small bowel bleeding , risk recurrent small bowel bleed 4 time high patient continue use ASA discontinue ASA . Management ASA-associated small bowel bleed major clinical challenge two reason . First , single effective treatment small bowel ulcer . Unlike peptic ulcer , injury small bowel acid-independent . Thus , conventional stomach protective drug heal prevent small bowel ulcer ASA user . Neither switch non-ASA anti-platelet drug reduce risk bleeding . Second , show continuation ASA increase risk recurrent small bowel bleeding . However , discontinuation ASA expose patient thrombotic complication . Currently , local international guideline management ASA-associated small bowel bleeding . Suppression prostaglandin synthesis important mechanism ASA-induced small injury . Consistent theory , preliminary data case series show misoprostol , prostaglandin analog , heal small bowel ulcer ASA user . However , efficacy misoprostol heal ASA-associated small bowel ulcer yet confirm prospective randomize trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . Suspected small bowel overt bleed melena hematochezia normal upper endoscopy colonoscopy 2 . Suspected small bowel occult blood loss define significant decrease hemoglobin ( ≥ 2g/dL ) , normal upper endoscopy colonoscopy , confirm iron deficiency anemia , absence identifiable cause hemoglobin decrease ( e.g . fluid overload , progressive renal failure , malnutrition , hematological disorder hemolysis malignancy ) 3 . Continuous use ASA duration trial 4 . Age ≥ 18 5 . Written inform consent obtain Exclusion criterion : Patients exclude one follow condition 1 . Increased risk capsule retention ( e.g . Gastric outlet obstruction , bypass surgery , Crohn 's disease suspect small bowel stricture ) 2 . Abnormal finding upper endoscopy ( e.g . Esophageal varix , grade C D erosive esophagitis , vascular malformation , ulcer , ≥5 erosion , neoplasm ) colonoscopy ( e.g . cancer , polyps &gt; 1cm , inflammatory bowel disease , vascular malformation , bleed hemorrhoid diverticular disease ) 3 .
