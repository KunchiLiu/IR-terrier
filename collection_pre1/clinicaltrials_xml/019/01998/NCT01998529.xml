	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerate dose heated cisplatin give patient lung tumor . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperthermic Thoracic Perfusion ( HITEC ) Children , Adolescents Adults With Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , chest surgery perform try remove many tumor possible . The chest surgery perform specifically research study would perform part standard care treatment even n't take part study . You give separate consent form sign explain detail risk chest surgery detail . During chest surgery , receive amifostine vein help prevent possible side effect , ear and/or kidney damage . The chest close plastic tube leave place . Then , chest wash begin . During chest wash , pump connect plastic tube push heat cisplatin chest pull recirculate cisplatin . The surgeon also wash closed area surgical site heat cisplatin . The heated cisplatin recirculated chest 60 minute surgeon gently press chest wall help cisplatin reach area chest . The plastic tube heat cisplatin pump stay place surgery drain extra fluid . These plastic tube would present even agree take part study . During surgery , extra blood ( ½ teaspoon time ) fluid chest area collect pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test begin receive first infusion heat cisplatin , 30 60 minute infusion start , 24 hour receive heat cisplatin . The blood fluid chest area collect already place catheter , additional needle stick require . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . There chance surgeon may decide surgery chest wash perform , example disease spread attach certain organ . If occurs , doctor discus treatment option surgery complete . Study Visits : On Days 1-5 , 11 , 14 , ( Day 1 day surgery ) : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You physical exam . Follow-Up Visits : About 1 month surgery complete , follow-up visit follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You hear test 1 month visit . It recommend follow-up visit MD Anderson 3 6 month surgery . In addition blood draw ( 1-3 teaspoon ) , MRI , CT , PET-CT scan check status disease . These 3 6 month visit surgery may perform local doctor 's office and/or laboratory . Length Study : You remain study 6 month . You take study disease get bad . If study doctor learn disease come back gotten bad 6 month follow-up visit , may eligible operation heat cisplatin wash repeat . If eligible surgery repeat , active participation study end give new consent form sign order re-enrolled back onto study . This investigational study . Cisplatin FDA-approved commercially available treatment advance bladder cancer , metastatic testicular cancer , metastatic ovarian cancer , hepatoblastoma , neuroblastoma , metastatic appendiceal cancer , abdominal mesothelioma . The use heat cisplatin wash chest surgery patient lung tumor investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
