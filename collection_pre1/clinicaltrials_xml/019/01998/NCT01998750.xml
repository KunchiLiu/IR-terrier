	<detailed_description>This clinical genomic study design investigate monogenic cause severe early childhood obesity . Subjects severe early onset obesity attend clinic Boston Children 's Hospital identify screen clinical database . These subject invite participate study . After obtain informed consent , obtain history proband family . We perform brief examination collect genetic material . Targeted sequence gene associate monogenic syndromic form obesity perform use next-generation sequence Broad Institute , Cambridge , MA . In selected individual favorable family history , full exome sequencing perform . Functional analysis newly identify variant perform possible .</detailed_description>
