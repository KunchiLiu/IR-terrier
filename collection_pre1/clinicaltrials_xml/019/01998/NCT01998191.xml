	<brief_title>Avoidable Mortality Case Note Review Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND What avoidable mortality ? As emphasized recent Francis Report care Mid-Staffordshire hospital , avoidable mortality important measure safety quality healthcare . Measures risk-adjusted mortality ( SHMI HSMR ) base population mortality statistic previously criticize overestimate harm . It difficult determine within measure degree death could prevent adequate medical care . To assess quality healthcare , useful focus death objective evidence related adverse event complication . Adverse event define injury complication occur result health care management result patient 's pathology , cause prolonged hospital stay , morbidity mortality . Avoidable mortality define death adverse event event occur contribute precipitate death . What methods measure avoidable mortality ? The avoidable nature inpatient death traditionally assess retrospective case record review . The best mean perform review unclear . The ideal review system would maximize adverse event detection rate efficient , timely pragmatic . There two type case note review : implicit ( holistic ) explicit . The implicit review involves train expert reading case note full access supplementary information . Current method use experienced reviewer provide holistic assessment case note intuitively sound . However process recruitment , train review note prolong . Implicit review subjective result low level inter-rater reliability explicit method . . It may insensitive detect difference care quality hospital level . Hogan colleague recently use holistic retrospective record review ass incidence hospital avoidable mortality England find rate 5.2 % mortality case . Explicit system , Global Trigger Tool , also use detect adverse event . The Institute Healthcare Improvement ( IHI ) develop Global Trigger Tool Measuring Adverse Events ( GTT ) , validate use United Kingdom ( UK ) Acute Trigger Tool . The GTT reliable valid method detect adverse event hospital high sensitivity harm detection review method good level inter-rater agreement specificity It use track rate adverse event time compare hospital event rate . The trigger tool use combination depth `` deep dive '' question investigate preventable hospital mortality . Kaiser Permanente ( KP ) develop quantitative method nurse physician guidance efficiently review note determine avoidable nature death . Explicit implicit case review method compare order ass quality care . This study novel compare sensitivity specificity determine preventability mortality . Who act avoidable mortality reviewer ? Given limited number available expert reviewer , would useful demonstrate reviewer similar reliability assess avoidable death . Trained nurse potential resource case note review . They basic clinical skill knowledge . However protocol drive method may safeguard error due decrease appreciation clinical event . Therefore explicit criterion review maybe likely demonstrate great inter-rater reliability . What purpose study ? This study aim assess efficient reliable case note review method detect avoidable death , could apply regular basis investigate excess mortality hospital . It also evaluate appropriately trained nurse reliably detect avoidable death whether specificity sensitivity review comparable experienced physician reviewer . INTERVENTION : EXPLICIT CASE REVIEW METHOD A modify Acute Trigger Tool ( ATT ) ; UK version IHI Global Trigger Tool use . ( Appendix 1 ) Each reviewer scan record look specific trigger . Once identify pertinent portion record analyse use `` deep-dive '' question validate KP . ( Appendix 2 ) These question aim determine whether preventable harm occur leading death . If find reviewer ignore trigger search trigger . Positive trigger indicate adverse event . If adverse event identify without trigger , also include . As result adverse event detect , reviewer judge preventability death use 6-point Likert scale . Data extract pre-formatted data sheet . For nurse review instance harm review validated physician team , nurse review doubt INTERVENTION : IMPLICIT CASE REVIEW METHOD Implicit review two-stage process . The reviewer read note judge whether adverse event occur whether error care pathway deem preventable . Reviewers ask assess aspect patient ' care entire record include nursing note drug chart . Demographic information collect well co-morbidities functional impairment For case adverse event lead death reviewer would judge preventability death use 6-point Likert scale . Data extract use structure data collection form . STANDARDISED DETERMINATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT Adverse event implies unintended harm patient . These also include follow : - Event perspective patient would harm occur ( NB include psychological harm ) - Event natural progression disease process ; i.e . part medical treatment - Events present admission , provide harm relate medical care , e.g . delay diagnosis outpatient For method reviewer opportunity discuss question expert reviewer research team . For adverse event lead death timing , contributory factor assess reviewer log . STANDARDISED SEVERITY SCORING OF ADVERSE EVENT ( NCC MERP ) Category E : Temporary harm patient require intervention Category F : Temporary harm patient require initial prolonged hospitalization Category G : Permanent patient harm Category H : Intervention require sustain life Category I : Patient death STANDARDISED TRAINING All nurse physician reviewer involve study shall complete ATT training , comprise web-based seminar practice note . They assess use example case note ensure satisfactory level detection achieve . Training implicit case note review also employ use iterative process example note . Once acceptable standard reach reviewer review process commence . BLINDING - Reviewers blind result previous assessment bias result . - The research team blind review note method collect result . - All reviewer give randomly generate identification number . RANDOMISATION Randomisation reviewer note perform use random number generator . All note reviewer assign random number allocate group . CONTROL GROUP Each review group act control study . The case note assess team use different method order introduce bias due increase learning team change review method also note cross .</detailed_description>
