	<detailed_description>To contrast recurrence rate gallstone patient gallbladder double sphincter patient general gallbladder sphincter underwent treatment cholecystolithiasis minimally invasive cholecystolithotomy gallbladder reservation . Method : Patients gallbladder double sphincter patient general gallbladder sphincter underwent treatment cholecystolithiasis minimally invasive cholecystolithotomy gallbladder reservation The Affiliated Hospital Guiyang Medical College May 2012 December 2015 . We collect patient ' bile surgery.Patients gallbladder double sphincter trial group , patient general gallbladder sphincter control group.the overall follow-up period 3 year . Then investigator statistically analyze improvement cholecystolithiasis symptom , thickness gall bladder wall , gallbladder function rate recurrence cholesterol gallstone 2 groups.we also analysis genetic difference bile two group .</detailed_description>
