	<brief_summary>Sepsis major global health problem , lead substantial morbidity mortality despite medical care . The initial diagnosis sepsis clinical challenge , base nonspecific systemic criterion . Excessive endothelial activation cardinal feature sepsis contribute microvascular leak , edema , circulatory shock organ failure . Activated endothelial cell shed endothelial microparticles ( EMPs ) measure plasma find low level healthy subject . Elevated EMPs report sepsis , whether effect beneficial deleterious unclear . In context , hypothesize circulate EMP level assess biomarker differentiate sepsis non-sepsis critical illness . This may also suggest EMP level correlate 30-day mortality . We propose measure circulate EMPs ICU admission subject suspect sepsis . Final diagnosis adjudicate use standard criterion 30-day mortality ascertain . Subjects determine sepsis serve control group . EMP level correlate diagnosis ascertain utility EMP level diagnostic biomarker sepsis . For subject proven sepsis , EMP level correlate 30-day mortality ass EMP level prognostic marker sepsis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In presence infection , normal immune physiologic response act concert eradicate pathogen . When response inappropriately regulate , sepsis develops . Sepsis characterize systemic manifestation infection . The diagnosis make identify least 2 component systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , base four clinical laboratory criterion : respiratory rate , tachycardia , temperature , leukocyte level presence document infection . The presence acute organ dysfunction set defines severe sepsis , hypotension reverse fluid administration defines entity septic shock . Severe sepsis well severe form , septic shock , significant global health concern , afflict million patient worldwide , increase incidence , associate mortality rate &gt; 25 % . In United States alone , estimate 750,000 people develop sepsis severe sepsis year , sepsis/septic shock 11th lead illness lead mortality US . The annual cost burden sepsis estimate $ 17 billion . For reason , clinical investigator interested sepsis direct effort toward identify biomarker would useful make early diagnosis sepsis . In addition early diagnosis , biomarkers prognosis seek guide severity assessment guide personalize treatment individual patient . Endothelial Activation Sepsis Endothelial activation occur early systemic infection adaptive response , allow leukocyte migration sit microbial invasion . In sepsis , however , endothelial activation excessive pose follow risk : harm via tissue damage due excessive leukocyte recruitment , disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) relate loss endothelial anticoagulant property , apoptotic death endothelial cell , loss microvascular barrier function . The dysfunctional endothelial barrier lead vascular leak tissue edema , hallmarks sepsis . This loss endothelial barrier function link increased morbidity mortality animal model sepsis . Endothelial Microparticles Microparticles intact vesicle size 0.2-2.0 Î¼m release plasma membrane multiple cell type set cell injury , activation , and/or apoptosis . In healthy individual , microparticles find plasma derive platelet , erythrocyte , leukocyte , endothelial cell . EMPS generally circulate relatively low level reflect normal endothelial cell turnover . Elevated circulating level EMPs identify number illness include sickle cell disease , immune-mediated thrombotic syndrome antiphospholipid syndrome heparin-induced thrombocytopenia , diabetes , chronic renal failure , acute coronary syndrome , stroke , venous thromboembolic disease , metabolic syndrome , severe hypertension , paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria , multiple sclerosis . The functional role may play endothelial microparticles diverse include neutrophil activation , chemotactic attraction leukocyte , platelet aggregation , generation thrombin ( vitro ) superoxide anion , stimulation endothelial proliferation , induction angiogenesis , MMP-2 MMP-9 expression enable vascular invasion basement membrane , carry endothelial protein protein C. Given importance endothelium pathogenesis sepsis , propose examine role endothelial-derived microparticles ( EMPs ) biomarker sepsis .</detailed_description>
