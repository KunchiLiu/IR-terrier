	<brief_summary>The objective study compare performance characteristic accuracy different in-home screening test colorectal cancer ( fecal occult blood test ) , among patient without symptom colorectal cancer . Patients meet study eligibility criterion agree participate study ask perform one guaiac two immunochemical fecal occult blood test home prior colonoscopy . After patient complete sent test kit , patient undergoes previously schedule colonoscopy . Accuracy performance characteristic type fecal occult blood test , include sensitivity , specificity , test positivity rate positive predictive value advance colorectal neoplasia ( advanced colorectal polyp ) colorectal cancer , estimate compare fecal occult blood test result result colonoscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One recommend option colorectal cancer screen population average risk colorectal cancer annual fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) start age 50 . Randomized controlled trial show annual biennial fecal occult blood test use guaiac-based test reduces incidence mortality colorectal cancer . However , sensitivity specificity guaiac-based test relatively low . Guaiac-based fecal test produce false-positive false-negative result certain food , vitamin , medication , dietary restriction generally recommended test . Newer , immunochemical FOBTs use antibody detect globin portion human hemoglobin require dietary restriction . These immunochemical test may improve performance characteristic ( sensitivity specificity ) compare guaiac-based test . However , study performance characteristic immunochemical test average-risk population , particularly iFOBTs currently available U.S . There several iFOBT test U.S. market may different performance characteristic . Some new immunochemical test also advantage simple sampling procedure patient . Guaiac-based FOBTs generally use stick spatula collect specimen three stool contact toilet bowl water ; specimen smear test card . However , immunochemical test allow sample collection brush surface stool toilet bowl water . In addition , immunochemical test require sample one two stool . Colorectal cancer lead cause cancer-related morbidity mortality . Key policy group include ACS , American College Radiology , U.S. Multi-society Task Force Colorectal Cancer , U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend FOBT ( guaiac immunochemical-based ) one several appropriate screening strategy colorectal cancer . Although colonoscopy high sensitivity specificity FOBT detecting advance colorectal neoplasia , colonoscopy invasive test several potential disadvantage screen average-risk population , include high cost , capacity limitation , increase risk complication . Immunochemical FOBT may advantage guaiac-based FOBT colonoscopy screen average-risk population , include good performance characteristic well patient acceptability gFOBT low cost colonoscopy . Unfortunately , scientific literature sensitivity specificity respective test sufficient support specific recommendation test best routine screening among asymptomatic adult . This study address crucial gap literature .</detailed_description>
