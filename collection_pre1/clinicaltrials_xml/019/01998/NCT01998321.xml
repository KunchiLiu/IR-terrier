	<brief_title>PSI Bilateral Simultaneous TKA Sever Varus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence knee Osteoarthritis variable high Far East 47.0 % 70.2 % men woman respectively , 17.2 % 82.8 % male female respectively Middle East . The incidence bilateral knee Osteoarthritis 48 % . TKA standard treatment Osteoarthritis . Many author prefer bilateral simultaneous TKA perform straight forward case Knee Osteoarthritis , although high complication rate could discourage . Knee Osteoarthritis could associate articular deformity varus , valgus , flexion deformity rarely recurvatum . These deformity could associate bone loss , ligamentous laxity , leg length discrepancy , bilateral shorten disfigurement . These deformity need correct TKA make procedure difficult especially severe case associate problem describe . Some patient knee Osteoarthritis present late condition become bilateral sever articular deformity . Late presentation common feather develop country low income country also Middle Far East . With progression Knee Osteoarthritis patient 's condition deteriorate gradually , local generally increase loss cartilage bone lead deformity joint laxity . This general condition increase disability lead high risk associate obesity comorbidities . The late presentation multifactorial complex explain . There obvious reason economic constrain , late referral , lake experience surgeon high demand expectation full flexion Middle Far East . There unexplained reason fear surgery , misconception TKA psychological factor . Unilateral TKA patient bilateral knee Osteoarthritis sever articular deformity beneficial patient , allow correction deformity easy rehabilitation , may satisfy patient patient leave straight knee TKA deform knee side lead difficult rehabilitation may force TKA get deformity adapt knee . With dissatisfaction patient may refuse knee do . Bilateral simultaneous TKA patient sever articular deformity beneficial patient allow correction deformity easy rehabilitation . However bilateral simultaneous TKA complex case demand procedure could associate high rate complication fat embolism , mortality , infection , bleeding , deep venous thrombosis , general complication . PSI could useful bilateral simultaneous TKA eliminate use intramedullary guide may reduce operative time , bleed risk complication fat embolism infection . The aim study review outcome use PSI bilateral simultaneous TKA patient sever articular deformity common middle east region .</detailed_description>
