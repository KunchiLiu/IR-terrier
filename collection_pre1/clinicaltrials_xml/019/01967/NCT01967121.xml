	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine application ice , control group , muscle stimulation program CompexÂ® series help reduce eliminate delayed muscle soreness perform leg extension flexion . Individuals complete health history questionnaire determine qualify study . We measure leg girth measure tape take pain measurement hamstring use spring press leg . Individuals warm-up bike without resistance 5 minute follow 10 regular leg extension flexion exercise . Individuals perform 6 set 10 leg extension flexion exercise biodex machine ( similar leg curl machine gym ) . Individuals perform set maximum effort capables . After set 10 individual 2 minute rest . We ask rank leg soreness scale 1-10 . Individuals assign modality either ice , control group compex . Individuals perform modality ( ice , control , compex ) assign longer sore . Over next five day individual return measure level soreness , leg girth pain pressure . This study examine follow hypothesis : H1 : There difference pressure pain threshold use Compex compare group . H2 : There difference perceive soreness use Compex compare group . H3 : There difference muscular strength use Compex compare group . H4 : There difference active range motion use Compex compare group .</brief_summary>
