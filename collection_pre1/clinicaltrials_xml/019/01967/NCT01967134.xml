	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , dose-escalation study three study group . This study conduct 25 HIV negative subject , 17 Latent Tuberculosis Infection ( LTBI ) 8 LTBI study enrollment . The investigational product H56 : IC31 ( AERAS-456 ) dose 15 ug H56 antigen IC31 500 nmol KLK ( 15/500 ) , dose 50 ug H56 antigen IC31 500 nmol KLK ( 50/500 ) . The vaccine administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection . Subjects assign study group base LTBI status enrollment time completion screen . Subjects without LTBI assign Group 1 . Subjects LTBI sequentially assign Groups 2 3 base order complete screening . All subject receive first dose study vaccine Study Day 0 , second dose study vaccine Study Day 56 , third dose study vaccine Study Day 112 . Enrollment subject Group 2 begin review safety data 14-day period initial vaccination subject Group 1 . Likewise , enrollment subject Group 3 begin correspond review safety data Group 2 . The total duration study follow-up subject 210 day . Study group 1 -2 enroll 8 subject study group 3 enroll 9 subject . This study plan single clinical site South Africa . The size specify study group select judged adequate preliminary safety immunogenicity evaluation Phase I study rather statistical reason .</detailed_description>
