	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish functional , molecular genetic profile fibroblast Fibromuscular Dysplasia ( FMD ) patient . This cellular profile compare profile fibroblast obtain age- gender-matched healthy control subject . This cellular data supplement detailed clinical history evaluation , assessment circulate protein cytokine level FMD versus healthy control subject , DNA sequence aim define causative genetic mutation ( ) .</brief_summary>
