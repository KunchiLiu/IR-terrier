	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Trial Optimizing Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Based ERCC1 Expression First-Line Treatment Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , randomize control clinical trial , aim demonstrate ERCC1 expression could predict efficacy platinum-based chemotherapy patient locally advance metastatic gastric cancer . A total 180 patient plan enrol study . ERCC1 protein expression paraffin-embedding tumor tissue examine immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Patients low ERCC1 expression ( group L ) treat XP regimen . Patients high ERCC1 expression randomize group H-A group H-B , treat XP DX regimen , respectively . The primary end point progression free survival ( PFS ) , secondary end point include median overall survival , objective response rate ( ORR ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) , duration response , safety ( number degree adverse event ) , quality life ( QOL ) .</detailed_description>
