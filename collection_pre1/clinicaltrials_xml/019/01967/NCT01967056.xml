	<brief_summary>Respiratory failure follow extubation cause significant morbidity increase mortality teh surgical intensive care unit ( SICU ) . However cause respiratory failure follow extubation remain poorly understood . The investigator hypothesize extubation failure predict base preoperative risk factor well ICU acquire morbidity include muscle weakness renal failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictors Respiratory Failure Following Extubation SICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both extubation delay extubation failure relate adverse outcome . A spontaneous breathe trial therefore recommend predict extubation readiness . However , depend disease entity local culture , range 10-20 per cent incidence extubation failure describe tertiary care hospital . The aim trial identify additional variable surgical patient use support clinician 's decision whether extubate patient 's trachea . Te investigator recently develop validated SPORC ( Brueckmann , 2013 ) , score predicts risk extubation failure follow surgery base patient comorbidities acuity disease lead surgery , investigator hypothesize SPORC also predict extubation failure surgical ICU . In addition , likely ICU acquire morbidity also predict extubation failure . In fact , investigator recently show muscle weakness predictor aspiration ( Mirzakhani , 2013 ) , investigator speculate muscle weakness may also respiratory failure extubation . Finally , suggest increase mortality see patient acute kidney injury ( AKI ) require continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) versus end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient require CRRT attribute increase need mechanical ventilation . ( Walcher , 2011 ) . Therefore , investigator also hypothesize acute kidney injury increase vulnerability patient postextubation respiratory failure .</detailed_description>
