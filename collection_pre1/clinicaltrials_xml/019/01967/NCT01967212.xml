	<brief_title>Swallowing Training Combined With Game-based Biofeedback Post-stroke Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Swallowing maneuver effective do correctly , evaluate use force extent laryngeal elevation difficult . The therapist often request patient `` swallow hard '' `` maintain laryngeal elevation '' . However , difficult provide appropriate feedback patient , 's hard see throat muscle contraction bone displacement , real point force clear , oral tactile feedback inadequate combine sensory loss , fatigue cognition impairment . Biofeedback define `` technique use equipment ( usually electronic ) reveal internal physiological event visual auditory signal , teach patient manipulate intrinsic physiological activity ( Basmajian , 1989 ) .The rationale thus patient see muscle activity , rather feel muscle contract , able contract muscle fiercely therefore able train muscle faster . Past study show biofeedback help nerve injury patient control physiological activity swallow training . The purpose study determine whether swallow training combine game-based biofeedback effective treatment dysphagia due stroke .</detailed_description>
