	<brief_summary>Influenza associate significant morbidity mortality . Institutionalized old adult ( age &gt; 65 ) group associate high risk complication . Influenza vaccines cornerstone influenza prevention one systematic review find statistically significant difference laboratory confirm influenza . A major reason immune senescence old adult result weak response towards vaccine compare young adult . Intradermal administration vaccine suggest improve immune response due abundance immunostimulatory cell , dendritic cell dermis . Intradermal administration influenza vaccine show comparable superior efficacy compare intramuscular administration &gt; 60-year old population rate adverse event post-vaccination also comparable . The immunogenicity intradermal administration also show well immunocompromised patient , include community dwell old adult . In addition , intradermal vaccination good acceptability safety profile different country , license Hong Kong worldwide . However , little study regard efficacy intradermal vaccination influenza institutionalize old adult , investigator therefore would like perform prospective , randomize study compare safety immunogenicity conventional full dose intramuscular immunization full dose intradermal immunization trivalent influenza vaccine institutionalize old adult . The hypothesis full dose intradermal trivalent influenza vaccination effective full-dose standard intramuscular injection term seroconversion seroprotection rate institutionalize old adult . Finding study important vaccination institutionalize old adult immunocompromised patient intradermal vaccine may induce good immune response influenza infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Intradermal Trivalent Influenza Vaccination Institutionalized Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , parallel-group single centre trial Queen Mary Hospital Fung Yiu King Hospital . Investigators aim recruit 100 subject would qualify Hospital Authority ( HA ) / Centre Health Protection ( CHP ) Mass Vaccination Program Trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) . These patient include Institutionalized old adult patient age 65 . After informed consent ( allow patient one week consider ) subject randomly assign 2 group receive follow vaccine : Group 1 : full-dose ( 1 dose ) standard TIV ( 15ug hemagglutinin TIV ) deliver intramuscularly use conventional needle , Group 2 : full-dose ( 1 dose ) intradermal injection ( 15ug hemagglutinin TIV ) deliver Intanza 15 day 0 . All TIV vaccine use study either Vaxigrip® ( Group 1 ) Intanza® Intradermal ( Group 2 ) , Sanofi-Pasteur provide Hospital Authority University Hong Kong . Baseline HI TIV measure day 0 . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion screen Community Geriatric Assessment Team ( CGAT ) Fung Yiu King Hospital investigator . Before commence , patient would allow one week consider join study . Meanwhile , investigator would also take 5ml serum participant test baseline TIV antibody . Principal Investigator experience administer intramuscular injection would responsible refill low-dose intradermal injection sterile technique . The microneedle device use study comprises array three 0.6 mm microneedles , make silicon crystal , bond tip plastic adapter , mount standard syringe . During injection , microneedle device lightly push shoulder microneedles penetrate outmost layer skin . The entire vaccine dose inject cause blanch bleb appear . Intramuscular injection conventional full-dose vaccine give usual way prefilled syringe . Principal Investigator responsible subject bleeding , serum separation , store doublet copy , freeze archiving , accord HKU protocol . MN HI analysis ( see ) shall conduct HKU Laboratory accord follow protocol : Microneutralization antibody assay ( MN ) NT perform inside type II Biosafety Cabinet Biosafety Containment level III facility . NT perform 96-well microtiter plate seed MDCK cell . Two fold serial dilution pair serum ( pre- post-vaccination ) test duplicate 100 TCID50 follow 3 virus : A/California/7/2009 ( H1N1 ) pdm09-like virus ; A/Victoria/361/2011 ( H3N2 ) -like virus ; B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus presence L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) -treated trypsin ( TPCK-trypsin ; Sigma ) . A corresponding set cell control serum without virus inoculation use control . The cell score inhibition cytopathic effect ( CPE ) 72~96 hour . The titer neutralization antibody define maximum dilution serum percentage CPE le equal 50 % . HI assay Serum sample test Hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) antibody follow : A/California/7/2009 ( H1N1 ) pdm09-like virus ; A/Victoria/361/2011 ( H3N2 ) -like virus ; B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus use reference antigen ( WHO influenza reagent kit provide World Health Organization influenza Collaborating Centre , CDC , Atlanta , Georgia , USA . HAI antibody assay perform standard microtiter technique removal non-specific inhibitor serum receptor destroy enzyme ( RDE ) ( 1:3 ) , incubation overnight 37 degree C follow heat-inactivation 56 degree C 30 minute . All serum sample subject test test antigen . Serial two-fold dilution RDE-treated serum 1:10 titrate 4 hemagglutinin unit reference antigens use 0.25 % turkey erythrocytes . A doublet backup serum sample would prepare frozen two separately locate freezer -20ºC potential future analysis and/or validation . Outcome measure : Primary outcome : . Change baseline ( day 0 vaccination ) neutralization antibody titre influenza day 21 day 180 vaccination Secondary outcome : . Adverse effect day 0-7</detailed_description>
