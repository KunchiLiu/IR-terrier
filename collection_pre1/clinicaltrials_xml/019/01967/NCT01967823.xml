	<brief_summary>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy treat patient cancer involve take white blood cell patient , grow laboratory large number , genetically modify , give cell back patient . In previous study NCI Surgery Branch use anti-ESO-1 gene type virus ( retrovirus ) make tumor fighting cell ( anti-ESO-1 cell ) . About half patient receive treatment experience shrink tumor . In study , use slightly different method produce anti-ESO-1 cell hope good make tumor shrink . Objectives : The purpose study see tumor fight cell ( genetically modify cell ) express receptor ESO-1 molecule surface cause tumor shrink see treatment safe . Eligibility : - Adults 18 year old old cancer ESO-1 molecule tumor . Design : - Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need - Leukapheresis : If patient meet requirement study undergo leukapheresis obtain white blood cell make anti ESO-1 cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure remove white blood cell patient . } - Treatment : Once cell grown patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , anti-ESO-1 cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . - Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Targeting NY-ESO-1 Patients With NY-ESO-1 Expressing Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRECIS Background : - We construct single retroviral vector contain &lt; = chain murine T cell receptor ( mTCR ) recognize NY-ESO-1 ( ESO ) tumor antigen , use mediate genetic transfer TCR high efficiency . - In co-cultures HLA-A2 ESO double positive tumor , anti-ESO mTCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount IFN- &gt; = high specificity . Objectives : Primary objective : - To determine whether administration anti-ESO mTCR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) plus high-dose aldesleukin follow non-myeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen may result objective tumor regression patient metastatic cancer express ESO antigen . Secondary objective : - Determine vivo survival mTCR gene-engineered cell . - Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients HLA-A*0201 positive 18 year age old must - Metastatic cancer include melanoma whose tumor express ESO antigen ; - Patients must previously receive non-responder recur receive standard care metastatic disease ; Patients may : - Contraindications high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - PBMC obtain leukapheresis culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth . - Transduction initiated exposure cell retroviral vector supernatant contain anti- ESO mTCR gene . This mTCR target exact epitope hTCR . - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine . - On day 0 patient receive anti-ESO mTCR gene-transduced PBMC begin high dose aldesleukin . - A complete evaluation evaluable lesion conduct 6 week ( +/- 2 week ) follow administration cell product . - The study conduct use phase II optimal design ( Simon R , Controlled Clinical Trials 10:1-10 , 1989 ) . The objective determine combination high dose aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , anti-ESO TCR-gene engineer lymphocyte able associated clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % PR + CR rate ( p1=0.20 ) . - A total 43 patient may enrol ( 41 , plus allow 2 non-evaluable patient ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS WITH SOLID TUMOR CANCERS AND MELANOMA 1 . Measurable metastatic cancer locally advance refractory/recurrent malignancy include melanoma express ESO assess one follow method : RTPCR tumor tissue , immunohistochemistry resect tissue , serum antibody reactive ESO . 2 . Confirmation diagnosis metastatic cancer include melanoma Laboratory Pathology NCI . 3 . Patients must previously receive first line standard therapy ( effective salvage chemotherapy regimen ) metastatic disease , know effective disease , either nonresponders ( progressive disease ) recur . 4 . Patients 3 few brain metastasis less 1 cm diameter asymptomatic eligible . Lesions treat stereotactic radiosurgery must clinically stable 1 month treatment patient eligible . Patients surgically resect brain metastasis eligible . 5 . More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , patient toxicity must recover grade 1 less ( except toxicity alopecia vitiligo ) . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion . 6 . Six week must elapse time antibody therapy could affect anti cancer immune response , include antiCTLA 4 therapy , time patient receives preparative regimen allow antibody level decline . Note : Patients previously receive ipilimumab document GI toxicity must normal colonoscopy normal colonic biopsy . INCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS WITH MALIGNANT MENINGIOMA 1 . Histologically proven recurrent meningioma aggressive meningioma Note : Confirmation ESO expression pathology require patient definitive radiologic evidence meningioma unresectable , radiation therapy without biopsy standard treatment 2 . Recurrent disease/progression receive standard treatment , must include follow : surgical resection , possible ; definitive radiation therapy unresectable meningioma , recurrent meningioma resection 3 .
