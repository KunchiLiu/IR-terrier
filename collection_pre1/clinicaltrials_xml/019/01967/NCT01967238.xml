	<brief_summary>In order produce well effective vaccine , important understand particular individual effective ineffective immune response vaccination . We go examine specific aspect antibody ( IgG Fc glycan ) make healthy volunteer receive different vaccine viral infection understand nature effective ( less effective ) vaccine response . The result research could use develop adjuvant increase/ improve vaccine response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Study IgG Fc Glycan Composition Human Immunity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antibodies principle mediator immunity infection also give rise autoimmune inflammatory disease . Two functional domain make IgG antibody - Fab domain bind specific target , Fc domain interact receptor molecule activate pro- anti- inflammatory state . The Fc domain IgGs contain glycan variable composition specific sugar component important determinant biologic activity IgGs protective pathologic immune response . New disease treatment could develop purposeful manipulation IgG Fc glycans , currently little know Fc glycan composition regulate . We plan study evaluate whether vaccination cause change Fc glycan composition , , whether signal helper T cell , age patient , and/or route vaccine administration determinant specific modification trigger vaccination . Next , study effect specific component within Fc glycan immunity common human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae influenza virus use vitro vivo model infection . We also study whether healthy adult previously infect dengue , zika chikungunya virus generate distinct Fc glycoforms vaccination compare healthy adult previously infect virus .</detailed_description>
