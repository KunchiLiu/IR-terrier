	<brief_summary>The main goal project develop , implement evaluate 5As Team intervention ( 5AsT ) healthcare practitioner improve weight management patient encounter improve patient health outcome . The 5As Obesity Management suite tool robust , evidence-based approach weight management , however implementation uptake heterogeneous primary care . This project co-created , implement , partner Southside Primary Care Network ( SSPCN ) . A needs assessment weight management SSPCN reveal need change provider practice increase number weight management visit . Despite robust didactic training session weight management provider , include 5As , uptake practice highly heterogeneous . Thus , 5AsT intervention address implementation 5As Obesity Management clinical practice develop collaborative team . The SSPCN consist 25 autonomous group multidisciplinary professional provide service define group patient within SSPCN . The 5As Team consist multidisciplinary provider ( Registered Nurse/ Nurse Practitioner , dietician , mental health worker ) work collaboratively . The intervention learn collaborative 12 different 5AsTs get together work address facilitator barrier weight management setting 6 month period . Half team ( N=12 ) remain control deliver usual care . They serve comparison group 5AsTs . This mixed method study 's primary outcome assess change provider practice effectiveness intervention implementation . To assess impact 5AsT patient , recruit patient present central SSPCN programming , We intervene directly patient ; observe impact 5AsT SSPCN program health outcome minimum 6 month , possible 18 month . Data collect include demographic , weight ( BMI ) , waist circumference , vital sign , Short Form-12 ( SF-12 , measure routinely measure SSPCN ) , EuroQol-5 dimension 5 Level ( EQ-5D-5L ) , modify patient assessment chronic illness ( PACIC ) , observed adherence routine clinical care guideline recommend laboratory monitoring ( cholesterol panel , fast glucose , HbA1c , appropriate ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity public health problem associate many co-morbidities , decreased life expectancy high health care cost . In 2008 , prevalence obesity overweight , combine , Canada 62.1 % . Supported Canadian Institute Health Research ( CIHR ) Public Health Agencies Canada Innovation strategy , Canadian Obesity Network develop novel tool obesity counsel management primary care setting know `` 5As Obesity Management '' . However , despite current dissemination strategy extensive provider education 5As , uptake current practice weight management inconsistent . Evidence suggest treat obesity reduce incidence number chronic disease , obesity effectively manage current health care system.This project co-created , implement , partner Southside Primary Care Network ( SSPCN ) . The main goal project develop evaluate pragmatic intervention call 5As Team Intervention ( 5AsT ) act health professional , form 6 month learn collaborative undergoes iterative , action base process address facilitator barrier weight management . Primary Objective : Increase number weight management visit conduct SSPCN Registered Nurses/Nurse Practitioners ( RN/NPs ) . Primary question : 1 . Does 5As Team ( 5AsT ) intervention affect number weight management visit conduct SSPCN practitioner ( RN/NP ) SSPCN practice ? 2 . Under circumstance 5AsT intervention affect number weight management visit conduct SSPCN practitioner ? 3 . Are change weight management visit rate sustain follow intervention period ? 4 . What impact implementation 5AsT practice level outcome - unique 5As Teams SSPCN ? Secondary Objective : To evaluate impact SSPCN weight management programming , without 5AsT intervention , patient important outcome include : weight ( BMI ) , blood pressure , self report health status ( EQ5D , SF-12 ) , patient-reported measure chronic disease management obesity ( modify PACIC ) , well completion appropriate laboratory study ( HbA1c diabetic , fast glucose , cholesterol panel age &gt; 40 ) . Design : This mixed method , pragmatic cluster randomize trial regular practice . The quantitative portion focus provider weight management visit , patient-important outcome . For patient study , 2 primary patient outcome study power BMI SF-12 , remainder secondary patient outcome . The qualitative portion seek understand implementation process efficacy 5AsT intervention . Practitioners affiliate different clinical group randomize intervention control . All practitioner receive robust didactic training program weight management . The intervention group practitioner participate 6 month 5AsT learn collaborative address barrier implementation effective weight management strategy base upon 5As Obesity Management tool kit . Interested patient present central SSPCN programming recruit participate study . There study intervention patient ; study observe weight management journey SSPCN - whether come intervention control practice group . We conduct rigorous qualitative analysis intervention process use numerous qualitative tool assess intervention participant view . A qualitative plan create outline use field note , focus group interview collect data use Thematic Analysis Nvivo software analysis . Intervention : The 5As Team ( 5AsT ) Program intervention study base behavior change theory . The Teams group SSPCN practitioner ( RN/NP , Social work , Registered Dietitian ) practice collaboratively community ( N=25 ) . The intervention group ( N=12 team ) participate additional 6 month intensive learn collaborative model design around 5As obesity management , address area identify barrier ( i.e . weight bias , clinical environment , clinic process &amp; team base care , mental health , counsel around emotional eating , caregiver fatigue , design appropriate patient follow-up , additional topic identify professional ) . A clinical Champion identify partner SSPCN available provide 1:1 support coach practitioner &amp; team need . The practitioner work collaboratively needs assessment , identify additional resource tool need overcome barrier weight management setting . The research team use Practice Facilitation model provide additional resource support change process practitioner . Setting : The SSPCN one large Primary Care Networks ( PCN ) Alberta , serve ethnically socially diverse population 45 community family practice . The SSPCN centralizes program available independent family practice . Also , primary care center SSPCN team personnel report directly SSPCN , responsible delivering service patient patient catchment .</detailed_description>
