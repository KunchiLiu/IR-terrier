	<brief_title>Best African American Response Asthma Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BARD 66 week prospective , randomize , double-blind , crossover trial Blacks ( individual self-report Black ancestry ) inadequately control asthma take low-dose inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) . BARD examine efficacy increase dose ICS without addition long-acting beta agonist ( LABA ) determine whether individual patient respond good one treatment another , , whether response different child adult related genetic ancestry .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Individuals selfreport Black ancestry ( least 1 Black grandparent ) . 2 . Able perform reproducible spirometry accord ATS criterion . 3 . Clinical history consistent asthma . 4 . Baseline FEV1≥40 % predict and/or postbronchodilator FEV1≥40 % predict . 5 . Asthma confirm either : ( 1 ) Betaagonist reversibility 4 puff albuterol ≥ 12 % OR ( 2 ) PC20FEV1 ≤ 16 mg/ml OR ( 3 ) absolute relative change % predict FEV1 ≥ 12 % two measurement document repeat spirogram previous year 6 . Either : A ) inadequately control low , medium highdose ICS monotherapy , low mediumdose ICS/LABA , B ) wellcontrolled medium highdose ICS monotherapy , low , medium highdose ICS/LABA . Inadequate asthma control define ACT/cACT score &lt; 20 ; wellcontrolled asthma define ACT/cACT score ≥20 . 7 . Stable asthma controller therapy dose ( ICS ICS/LABA ) 2 week prior enrollment . 8 . Nonsmoker ( total lifetime smoke history &lt; 5 packyears &lt; 18 , &lt; 10 packyears ≥18 year age ; smoke least 1 year ) . 9 . For participant ≥18 year age : Ability provide inform consent . For participant 18 year age : Ability provide verbal write assent ability parent provide inform consent . 1 . Medical contraindication LABA history adverse reaction ICS LABA preparation ingredient . 2 . Current prior use medication know significantly interact corticosteroid disposition within twoweek period precede enrollment . 3 . Unwilling provide blood sample DNA extraction genetic analysis . 4 . Major medical problem prohibit study participation , i.e . presence chronic active lung disease asthma history unstable significant medical illness asthma , include thyroid disease , diabetes mellitus , Cushing 's disease , Addison 's disease , hepatic disease , concurrent medical problem could require oral corticosteroid study would place participant increase risk . 5 . Systemic corticosteroid treatment condition within 4 week enrollment five course systemic corticosteroid past year . 6 . History lifethreatening asthma exacerbation require intubation , mechanical ventilation , result hypoxic seizure within last 2 year . 7 . History respiratory tract infection within 4 week enrollment . 8 . If female childbearing potential , failure practice abstinence use acceptable birth control method . 9 . Pregnancy lactation plan get pregnant course trial . 10 . Receiving hyposensitization therapy establish maintenance regimen define continuous regimen ≥ 3 month prior enrollment . 11 .
