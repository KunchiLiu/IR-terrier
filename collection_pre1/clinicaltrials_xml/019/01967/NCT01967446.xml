	<brief_summary>The Investigators hypothesize functional status score elderly woman undergo surgery pelvic organ prolapse low 6 week post-operatively return baseline 12 week post-operatively . The Investigators hypothesize great co-morbidity , frailty worse functional status surgery associate slow functional recovery , prolong length stay hospital nursing care institution great post-operative complication follow surgery pelvic organ prolapse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictors Post Operative Morbidity Older Women With Pelvic Organ Prolapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increase number elderly woman undergo surgical treatment pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) . Based US Census data1 estimate prevalence pelvic organ prolapse woman 60 , estimate 1.6 million woman 60 currently affect pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) . This number expect increase 3.4 million 2050 . Prior study show geriatric patient unique physiologic vulnerability , elderly woman undergo surgery risk bad post-operative outcome young woman . However , data urogynecology literature conflicting . Some study show increase risk complication woman age study show significant increase risk . Other evidence suggest elderly woman still baseline quality-of-life status 6 week post-operatively . Return baseline functional status 6 week post-operatively improved woman randomize enhanced pre-operative geriatric assessment versus routine care . These study limit low number old woman woman undergo obliterative surgery , usually recommend woman higher co-morbidities lower functional status . Post-operative outcome traditionally measure term medically document complication infection , organ injury , cardiac pulmonary complication . However , study surgical specialty suggest old subject undergo surgery suffer significant worsen functional status result disability , need long-term care , dependency home . Objective marker functional status , co-morbidity frailty potential useful predictor post-operative complication follow surgery elderly . However , lack data functional status elderly woman undergo POP surgery , well factor influence recovery surgery . The goal study explore utility pre-operative marker functional status , co-morbidities frailty explain post-operative morbidity elderly woman undergo surgical treatment pelvic organ prolapse .</detailed_description>
