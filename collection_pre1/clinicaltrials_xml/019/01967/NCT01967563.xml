	<detailed_description>Popular weight loss strategy often prescribe target reduction dietary carbohydrate fat . Recent clinical trial obese subject find low-carbohydrate diet result great weight loss compare low-fat diet time scale month diet adherence likely high . One hypothesis regard mechanism improve weight loss low carbohydrate diet diet significantly modify body hormonal milieu influence metabolic regulation energy expenditure . Low-carbohydrate diet may thereby offer metabolic advantage low fat diet . In addition , low-carbohydrate diet may also decrease hunger increase satiety compare low-fat diet . Determining mechanism whereby one diet lead great weight loss another hamper inability accurately measure food intake physical activity outpatient set . Thus , inpatient feeding study last many week require accurately measure energy balance difference isocaloric diet differ macronutrient composition . In pilot multicenter cross-over study 16 overweight class I obese men , measure change energy expenditure response 4 week inpatient feed eucaloric , low carbohydrate , ketogenic diet ( 5 % Carbohydrate , 15 % Protein , 80 % Fat ) immediately follow inpatient period least 4 week consume energy balance standard American diet ( 50 % Carbohydrate , 15 % Protein , 35 % Fat ) .</detailed_description>
