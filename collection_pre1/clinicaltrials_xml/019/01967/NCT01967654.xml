Data collection . 1 ) Key informant interview . The investigator conduct key informant interview least one senior level staff person follow stakeholder group : ) MOH central level agency involve tobacco control VINACOSH , Ministries Education Training Science Technology ; b ) Executive Directors Vietnam Medical Association Vietnam Public Health Association ; c ) WHO Vietnam ; ) provincial level , representative Department Health Preventive Medicine Center ; e ) four district health director two target province ( HaNoi Thai Nguyen ) total 16 interview .

Research staff follow-up telephone enroll stakeholder study . The investigator conduct interview . 2 ) Focus group : An experienced facilitator ISMS conduct six focus group ( 3 study district ) current smoker ( 6-8 participant , 4 male 2 female group ) . The focus group assess expectation health benefit quit , past cessation history , include availability , affordability use cessation medication , knowledge cessation resource , attitude towards propose intervention . There relatively large database knowledge attitude tobacco use among smoker Vietnam . Therefore , group focus access treatment , attitude towards pharmacotherapy treatment preference . Inclusion/exclusion criterion include : current smoker ( smoke past 7 day ) , patient CHC one two study district , age 18 . Recruitment focus group : method use recruit patient pilot study . Patients screen current tobacco use CHCs , ask participate meet eligibility criterion give date time meeting . Consent obtain time focus group . 3 ) Baseline study site assessment : In enrol study site follow conduct : ) assessment baseline organizational characteristic . This include data setting-level variable show influence implementation practice guideline include number FTE staff , clinic volume , policy system . A practice environment checklist use inventory current policy , workflow , system ( e.g . chart system ) staff roles responsibility general , specifically related tobacco use treatment . b ) Semi-structured interview clinical administrative key informant ( clinical director , 2 CHWs 3 provider per site ) supplement checklist data elaborate potential barrier facilitator tobacco use treatment . c ) A provider CHW survey ( tested pilot research base survey WHO validate Vietnamese ) .

AIM 2 : To compare effectiveness cost effectiveness two implementation strategy increase adherence tobacco use treatment guideline , AIM 3 : To explore organizational factor hypothesize influence relationship implementation strategy implementation effectiveness . The Aims combine remainder Approach section overlap design data collection . A two arm , randomize trial compare approach use : ARM 1 ) technical assistance , training , clinical reminder system ( TTC ) , ARM 2 ) TTC+ referral CHW additional counseling follow-up . The investigator conduct baseline assessment provider adherence tobacco use treatment collect patient exit interview ( PEIs ) ( i.e. , survey conduct immediately patient visit ) 50 patient per site meet eligibility criterion current smoker . We implement component ARM 1 2 . At 12 month post implementation conduct PEIs another 50 smoker per site . These patient ask consent follow-up survey 3 6 month ass smoke abstinence . Study Site eligibility recruitment . The investigator choose two province represent urban rural setting . Thai Nguyen Hanoi The district select Hanoi representative CHCs locate central part city district Thai Nguyen representative rural CHCs province . Site criterion include least one physician , &gt; 4 allied health care professional staff , &gt; 5 CHWs patient population least 4000 . Using method site recruitment use ISMS , Director District Health Centers introduce study CHCs fit criterion letter introduction follow-up telephone person contact . Among express interest , randomly select 26 CHCs ( 13 rural 13 urban ) . Sites randomly assign 1:1 ratio intervention condition within urban rural stratum . We recruit sit 3 successive wave .</detailed_description>
