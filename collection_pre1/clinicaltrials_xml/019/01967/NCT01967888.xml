	<brief_summary>The study phase 2/3 , multicenter , double-blind , parallel assignment study . It involve 100 adult recipient intra-hepatic pancreatic Islet Auto-Transplantation ( IAT ) . The objective clinical trial ass whether reparixin lead improved transplant outcome measure proportion insulin-independent patient follow IAT . The safety reparixin specific clinical setting also evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In contrast allo-transplantation type 1 diabetes patient , immunological mechanism involve allo- auto-antibodies affect long-term graft function , outcome IAT ( Islet Auto-Transplantation ) independent immunological process require immunosuppression management . On hand , early inflammatory event intrinsic intra-portal islet infusion demonstrate impact islet engraftment . Among possible mechanism , PMNs find predominant cell type infiltrate liver syngeneic model islet transplantation mouse . Data obtain experimental model islet transplantation mouse demonstrate clear effect reparixin improve graft survival function . Protection loss and/or deterioration transplant islet evident regardless immunological mechanism involve islet damage , suggest ability reparixin modulate early inflammatory response readily impact graft outcome . Thus , use reparixin may emerge potential useful medication control non specific inflammatory event surround early phase IAT . The goal study reach total 100 adult patient randomize receive IAT total completion pancreatectomy . Patients randomly ( 1:1 ) assign receive either reparixin [ continuous i.v . infusion 7 day ( 168hrs ) ] , match placebo ( control group ) , start approximately 12hrs islet infusion . The two group balance within centre . All patient randomize receive Investigational Product ( either reparixin placebo ) inlcuded ITT analysis . Patients ITT analysis whether receive IAT , exclusion make event occur randomization could influence randomized assignment . Recruitment competitive among study site , plan number patient enrol . Competitive recruitment choose increase speed recruitment account difference transplant rate among study site . Each centre enroll patient rapidly possible , maximum 40 patient ( per randomization list ) . Each patient involve study 7 day hospital stay pancreatectomy follow islet transplantation , require measurement hospital discharge 2 post-transplant visit schedule @ day 75+14 365+14 transplant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible IAT follow total ( completion ) pancreatectomy . Ages &gt; 18 year . Patients willing able comply protocol procedure duration study , include schedule followup visit examination . Patients give write informed consent , prior studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw patient time without prejudice future medical care . Recipients previous IAT ( completion pancreatectomy ) . Patients undergoing total pancreatectomy due either pancreatic cancer pancreatic benign diseases chronic pancreatitis , include insulinomas , etc . Patients inadequate renal reserve per calculate creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) &lt; 60 mL/min accord CockcroftGault formula ( 1976 ) . Patients hepatic dysfunction define increase ALT/AST &gt; 3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) increase total bilirubin upper limit local laboratory ) . Patients Gilbert 's syndrome ( elevate unconjugated bilirubin level absence evidence hepatic biliary tract disease ) exclude . Patients preoperative International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) &gt; 1.5 know coagulopathy . Hypersensitivity : 1. ibuprofen one non steroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) . 2. medication belong class sulfonamide , sulfamethazine , sulfamethoxazole , sulfasalazine , nimesulide celecoxib . Concurrent sepsis ( per positive blood culture ( ) and/or fever associate sign systemic sepsis syndrome ) . Treatment systemic steroid 2 week prior enrolment ( except use &lt; 5mg prednisone daily equivalent dose hydrocortisone , physiological replacement ) immune modulators 4 week prior enrolment . Patients preexist diabetes evidence impair Î²cells function , base preoperative fasting blood glucose &gt; 115 mg/dL and/or HbA1c &gt; 6.5 % , require treatment antidiabetic medication ( e.g . insulin , metformin , etc ) within 2 week prior enrolment . Use investigational agent 4 week prior enrolment , include anticytokine/chemokine agent . Pregnant breastfeeding woman ; unwillingness use effective contraceptive measure ( female male ) . ( NB : pregnancy avoid patient partner first month complete treatment Investigational Product ; specific warning describe , consider treatment course Investigational Product , PK profile , lack significant adverse effect mat performance fertility animal study ) . Patients past current history alcohol abuse base clinical history and/or past treatment alcohol addiction . Patients evidence preoperative portal hypertension per clinical history abdominal/liver image ultrasound technique . Sites comply additional restrictive exclusion criterion locally accept , per centre practice .</criteria>
