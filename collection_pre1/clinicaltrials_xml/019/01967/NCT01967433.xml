	<brief_title>Diphenhydramine Adjunctive Sedative Patients Chronic Opioids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : The primary aim study determine addition Diphenhydramine Fentanyl Midazolam decrease dose Fentanyl Midazolam use colonoscopy individual chronic opioids . Secondarily look quality sedation , duration colonoscopy , time reach cecum adverse effect ( hypoxia define O2 saturation le 89 % last 30 second , hypotension define systolic BP le 90 mmhg use reversal agent i.e Naloxone Flumazenil ) . Day Procedure : After consent obtain medical record patient review demographic information , co-morbidities , current medication extract record . On day colonoscopy Alcohol use disorder inventory ( AUDIT ) use screen alcohol abuse . AUDIT develop World Health Organization validate period 2 decade . It consist 10 question , question score 0-4 basis subject alcohol use . It take 2-4 minute complete . A score 10 great highly specific alcohol use . Subjects check prepared accord routine protocol VA medical center . Participants randomly assign receive either 50 mg diphenhydramine 10 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride . On day colonoscopy randomization perform independent investigator pharmacist VA medical center use website http : //www.randomization.com . She also prepare dispense medication . Each endoscopy team consist attend gastroenterologist , gastroenterology fellow two nurse . Medications administer one nurse direct supervision physician . At start procedure baseline vitals record per unit 's policy . Research medication administer 3 minute prior administration medication . Neither patient medical staff include endoscopist aware content vial . Conscious sedation achieve use combination intravenous midazolam fentanyl standard sedative . Rarely , additional diphenhydramine give , basis judgment endoscopist . During procedure vital sign include oxygen saturation monitor 3-5 minute interval . Procedure related complication , include hypotension , desaturation cardiac arrhythmia manage accord endoscopy unit policy protocol . Following procedure , nurse fellow attend individually rate quality sedation ten-point Likert scale . Qualitative assessment also make ( Under-sedated , adequately sedate , over-sedated ) . Recovery time record . Day Following Colonoscopy Twenty-four hour discharge follow call make patient asked evaluate level sedation 10-point scale ( 1 , inadequate ; 10 completely without discomfort ) ; pain ( 1 , pain ; 10 severe pain ) , amnesia ( 10 , memory procedure ; 1 complete memory ) .</detailed_description>
