	<detailed_description>Within Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) fiscal year 2011 , patient psychotic disorder represent approximately 4 % total population , receive approximately 14 % VHA 's total expenditure ( Blow et al. , 2011 ) . Patients psychosis receive substantial , repeat , costly inpatient treatment , often chance provide treatment due gap mental health service utilization ( Blow et al. , 2011 ; McCarthy et al. , 2007 ) . Thus , urgent need enhance efficacy effectiveness VHA inpatient service tailor good support recovery . Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) , recovery-oriented , evidence-based adjunct inpatient treatment psychosis , excellent candidate investigation within VHA inpatient setting . ACT psychosis consider empirically support treatment American Psychological Association ( APA , 2012 ; Chambless et al. , 1998 ) . A consistent body research demonstrate clinical effectiveness ACT treatment psychosis , include well-designed randomized clinical trial ACT inpatient setting ( Bach &amp; Hayes , 2000 ; Gaudiano &amp; Herbert , 2006 ) . ACT effective provide flexible format three four session , patient range chronic severe psychotic comorbid mental disorder . This propose pilot study aim explore ACT adjunct inpatient treatment usual ( TAU ) psychosis among VHA patient one VHA inpatient psychiatry unit . The project use effectiveness/ implementation Hybrid Type 1 design incorporates pilot RCT semi-formative evaluation barrier facilitator future implementation . Participants 80 VHA patient current psychotic symptom ( hallucination and/or delusion ) relate psychotic mood disorder admit inpatient psychiatry unit VA Palo Alto Health Care System ( VAPAHCS ) . Participants randomly assign receive either TAU ( n = 40 ) , TAU plus 4-sessions ACT ( n = 40 ) individually provide stay inpatient unit . Aim 1 investigate feasibility , acceptability , safety treatment VHA patient , indexed : ( ) ability recruit consent 2 eligible participant per week ( 40 week ) participate study randomize ACT + TAU TAU ; ( b ) patient attendance 3 ACT individual session ( 4 possible ) average ; ( c ) patient ACT Facilitator ( provider intervention ) , report ACT treatment satisfaction alliance ; ( ) occurrence zero serious adverse event attributable ACT treatment . Aim 2 investigate treatment effect ACT patient functioning ( i.e. , acceptance ) , symptomatology , distress , affect . Aim 3 obtain data participate patient unit staff regard system- , clinician- patient-level barrier facilitator implement staff-delivered ACT service psychosis participate VHA inpatient setting , include : ( ) barrier limit patient , staff , site participation ACT address ; ( b ) provider patient perception ACT successful achieve good outcome ; ( c ) site specific general barrier implementation ACT address ; ( ) perceive value sustain ACT absence fund project . This project first step explore potentially sustainable effective intervention improve inpatient psychosis treatment recovery , hence , live VHA patient psychosis , reduce cost VHA . If promising , study finding support HSR &amp; D Investigator Initiated Research ( IIR ) Merit grant application propose assess effectiveness cost implement ACT intervention , potential barrier facilitator implementation effort multiple VHA inpatient psychiatric unit . The aim project align HSR &amp; D research priority area improve mental behavioral intervention individual serious mental illness refine recovery-oriented treatment approach relate evidence-based program .</detailed_description>
