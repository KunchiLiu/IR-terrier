	<brief_title>A Study Sipuleucel-T With Administration Enzalutamide Men With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label study design assess effect sipuleucel-T administer concurrently sequentially enzalutamide . This study consist 3 phase . The screening phase begin completion inform consent process continue registration . The active phase begin registration continue post-treatment visit ( 30 37 day follow last study treatment ) . The long term follow-up ( LTFU ) phase begin post-treatment visit continue subject 's death Dendreon terminate study .</detailed_description>
