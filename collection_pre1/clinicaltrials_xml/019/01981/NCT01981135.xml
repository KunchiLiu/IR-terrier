	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose protocol understand individual respond air pollutant ozone elevate temperature . Ultimately , help u understand risk poor air quality heat wave . Participants : We recruit 30 healthy adult , 18-55 year old , participate study . Procedures ( method ) : Subjects expose clean air 0.3 ppm ozone 2 hour intermittent exercise control environment chamber . For exposure temperature chamber 31-34oC ( 88-93 oF ) . Because aim study mimic high exposure heat wave , perform exposure day mean ambient temperature le 24 oC Chapel Hill previous day . Primary endpoint include spirometry Heart Rate Variability monitoring . Secondary endpoint include analysis blood clotting/coagulation factor , analysis soluble factor present plasma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over past decade , air quality U.S. improve significantly . Even , million people U.S. still live county meet air quality standard one pollutant . Global climate change widely accept occur thought range major potentially adverse effect ecosystem . Additionally , change climate lead high concentration harmful air pollutant , presence air pollutant atmosphere also accelerate climate change . Health effect impact complex interaction climate change air quality . Research need identify public health consequence interaction . One aspect understudied physiological response elevate temperature impact additional stressor air pollution . Several epidemiological study show strong link exposure air pollution adverse cardiopulmonary effect , respiratory tract infection , exacerbation asthma , chronic bronchitis , ischemic heart disease , stroke [ 1-3 ] . Ozone major component photochemical smog . Controlled human exposure study critical demonstrating cause decrement lung function [ 4-10 ] lung inflammation . [ 11-13 ] The inflammation include increase neutrophil soluble pro-inflammatory mediator low airway [ 14 , 15 ] . The majority study involve controlled exposure relatively high ( 0.1 - 0.4ppm ) concentration short period time ( typically 2 hour ) . These short-term exposure study useful ) provide strong quantifiable exposure-response data b ) allow investigation biological change transient inconsequential extrapolate predict health outcome susceptible population long-term exposure . For example , healthy individual expose 0.4ppm ozone exposure 2hr [ 16 ] show a13.5 % decrement FEV1 , often accompany mild symptom tracheobronchial irritation cough . However , 3hours exposure , symptom largely disappear 2.7 % FEV1 decrement detectable . By 24hrs , even high ozone concentration recovery phase normally complete . The primary public health concern individual respiratory disease . If change occur person reduce reserve , ozone-induced change would superimpose preexist pulmonary impairment may significant health effect . Despite almost 30 year research effect ozone , study interaction ozone temperature . Although ozone normally elevate weather dry hot , control chamber study perform moderate temperature ( 70-75 oF ) . Those study address high temperature generally perform run-up Los Angeles Olympics 1984 center impairment exercise performance . For example , Gibbons Adams study ten aerobically trained young adult female exercise continuously 66 % maximum O2 uptake 1 h expose orally filter air 0.15 0.30 ppm ozone moderate ( 24 degree oC ) hot ( 35 degree oC ) ambient condition show subject likely cease exercise prematurely hot temperature . [ 17 ] Gong study elite cyclist show similar result . [ 18 ] Folinsbee et al. , studied effect 2-h exposure high level ozone ( 0.5 ppm ) 14 nonsmoking male four environmental condition ( 64.4 , 80.0 , 85.2 , 92.0 oF ) find great decrease FVC occur ozone exposure high temperature . [ 19 ] Those cite study focus respiratory outcome . Yet become clear ozone may systemic cardiac effect . Ozone react rapidly respiratory tissue absorb transported extrapulmonary site . However , recent study also show association long-term ozone exposure cardiovascular morbidity [ 20 , 21 ] . In addition , short-term exposure ozone may cause minor transient change high frequency heart rate variability ( HRV ) healthy adult [ 22 ] . Experimental study show heat stress similar modest effect component HRV . [ 23 ] The effect combination study date . Epidemiology study assess ozone-temperature-cardiac relationship generally uninformative since high ozone day normally occur hot weather . Traditional method suitable discriminate effect ozone temperature , let alone interaction . Those studied relationship show negative association temperature ozone-mortality due increase use air conditioning . [ 24 ] A recent study , however , use novel approach examine whether ozone modify association temperature cardiovascular mortality 95 large community USA , 1987-2000 , summer . They find 10oC increase temperature day associate increase mortality 1.17 % 8.31 % low high level ozone concentration community , respectively . [ 25 ] The purpose study perform first control chamber study order understand cardiovascular change result interaction heat ozone . The information obtain study enable EPA evaluate well risk air pollutant heat wave provide advice activity mitigate effect .</detailed_description>
