	<brief_summary>Under escalation treatment strategy patient display breakthrough disease parameter first line therapy , MS physicians allow EMEA switch Natalizumab ( NTZ ) fingolimod ( FGL ) . NTZ FGL efficacy demonstrate randomized therapeutic trial . As treatment test versus placebo common way compare look respective annualized relapse risk ratio decrease . Roughly NTZ decrease 70 % FGL 50 % . Nevertheless terrible comparison since placebo group different behaviour 2 trial patient demographic feature baseline also different . Therefore , right totally impossible compare 2 drug decent methodology . Only head-to-head comparison could . Unfortunately head-to-head comparison available probably do drug company initiative . During time study , perform phase IV , observational , prospective head-to-head comparison NTZ versus FGL efficacy 600 patient . Our primary end point disease free patient 1 year treatment . Further , trial allow u collect new biological sample , useful validation project main aim . Further new sample obtain 3 European country , must want generalize conclusion obtain French cohort . Cooperation European level thus essential implementation project .</brief_summary>
