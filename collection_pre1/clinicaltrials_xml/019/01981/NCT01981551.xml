For reason &gt; =secretase inhibitor know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation least 6 month dose study drug cease . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception duration study participation , 6 month completion study drug administration . 2.1.1.10 Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 2.1.1.11 Evidence measurable disease CT scan . Measurable lesion define accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) great equal 20 mm chest xray , great equal 10 mm CT scan , great equal 10 mm caliper clinical exam . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 2.1.2.1 Patients receive investigational agent . Concurrent mediation patient take review PI assess safety eligibility . 2.1.2.2 Prior treatment Gammasecretase inhibitor antinotch antibody therapy . 2.1.2.3 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , serious infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 2.1.2.4 QTc interval &gt; 470 msec study entry ; congenital long QT syndrome . 2.1.2.5 Pregnant woman exclude study PF03084014 Gammasecretase inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect .
