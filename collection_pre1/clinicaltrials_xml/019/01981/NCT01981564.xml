	<detailed_description>Asthma , lead chronic disorder childhood , number one cause pediatric emergency department ( ED ) visit young child responsible substantial impact healthcare cost . The ED often point contact low-income child many family view ED primary source asthma care . Poor minority child high asthma morbidity , least likely receive adequate preventive therapy specialty care frequently expose environmental trigger non-poor child . However , prior study , include pilot , indicate child frequent asthma ED visit attend one-time ED-based follow-up clinic asthma `` check-up '' education . The goal randomize controlled trial test efficacy multifaceted , ED + primary care provider ( PCP ) home-based intervention , Asthma Express ( AEx ) , child &gt; 2 asthma ED visit 1 hospitalization/year provide tailor guideline base asthma care . Allergy cotinine biomarkers , collect ED visit , use target home environmental control component intervention . The AEx intervention ( n=132 ) compare attention control ( CON ) group ( n=132 ) specific aim : ( 1 ) reduce asthma morbidity ( increase symptom free day night ) decrease ED visit hospitalization increase asthma control caregiver quality life , ( 2 ) improve use appropriate preventive anti-inflammatory medication base child pharmacy refill record ( 3 ) compare economic cost effect intervention . Children age 3-12 year &gt; 2 asthma ED visit 1 hospitalization within past 12 month current ED visit asthma recruit Johns Hopkins Pediatric-ED follow 12 month . Symptom frequency , health care utilization , caregiver quality life cotinine measure collect baseline , 6 12 month pharmacy data collect baseline 12 month . Data analysis include initial cross tabulation health outcome group ( AEx vs. CON ) multivariate generalize linear regression model study effect AEx treatment mean symptom free days/nights , repeat ED visit , hospitalization caregiver quality life score anti-inflammatory medication refill . Mean total cost ED , PCP visit , hospital day medication cost compare group ( AEx CON ) economic analysis . The AEx model design accessible , guideline-based , easily replicate incorporate ED care . If successful , study fill critical gap ED transition preventive care asthma interventional research .</detailed_description>
