	<brief_summary>Fluorescent lifetime microscopy emerge useful tool study fluorescent lifetime vitro . Fluorescence lifetime represent average amount time fluorophore remain excited state follow excitation depend fluorophores molecular environment . Fluorescence lifetime ophthalmoscopy ( FLIO ) technique quantify fluorescence lifetime human retina vivo . The purpose study investigate fluorescence lifetime characteristic human retina use FLIO . The investigator hypothesize FLIO allow identify area retinal metabolic stress ischemia detecting change fluorescence lifetime .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement Retinal Auto Fluorescence With Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Ophthalmoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Ophthalmic imaging make considerable progress last year . Especially introduction optical coherence tomography scan laser ophthalmoscope help understand structural change underlie various retinal disease . However , appearance structural change retinal disease often represent irreversible functional loss limit treatment option . In order prevent loss vision , retinal disease ideally diagnose structural change occur . This achieve image metabolic change retina retinal disease age relate macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy associate distinct metabolic change , mainly related oxidative stress . Recently , novel device image fluorescent lifetime retina vivo , fluorescent lifetime ophthalmoscope ( FLIO ) , develop . This device able measure fluorescence lifetimes retina macroscopic level may able shed new light metabolic disease retina . Objective To define fluorescence lifetime characteristic healthy patient patient various retinal disease . Methods The investigator use novel device , fluorescence lifetime ophthalmoscope ( FLIO ) investigate fluorescence lifetime human retina .</detailed_description>
