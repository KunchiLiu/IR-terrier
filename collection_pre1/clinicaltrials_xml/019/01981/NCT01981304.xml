	<detailed_description>Percutaneous coronary intervention stenting may induce endothelial damage/dysfunction inflammatory reaction , turn delay heal endothelialization may lead occurrence major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) , restenosis , atherosclerosis , stent thrombosis . Drugs , platforms polymer consider protagonist pathophysiologic process . Platforms Due advance stent technology , several stent platform available , include stainless steel , cobalt-chromium , platinum-chromium stent series . Pre-clinical animal study suggest platform might important advantage term vascular compatibility early late healing . In rabbit denudation model , show 14 day luminal surface area incompletely endothelialised CrCo stent nearly complete metal . Additionally , show thinner-strut stent associate reduce fibrin deposition rapid fibrin clearance porcine coronary artery compare thicker stent , thus suggest thin stent platform may induce less injury . As matter fact , The second-generation DESs , thinner strut , obviously associate suppression neointimal response rapid re-endothelialization stainless steel base stent design might better conformability vessel wall result le malposition . Polymers The polymer coating elute antiproliferative drug link complication include delayed vessel healing , hypersensitivity reaction , atheroma , restenosis , potential repeat intervention , stent thrombosis , acute myocardial infarction , sudden death . The link permanent polymer late adverse event prompt development variety biodegradable polymer coating . Absorption polymer may lower rate stent thrombosis , particularly beyond 1 year stent implantation . In addition , stent absorbable polymer may allow short duration dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) currently recommend The incidence late adverse event likely low absorption polymer implantation drug-eluting stent coat permanent polymer , less ongoing inflammation permanent polymer . In meta-analysis randomized trial , metal stent release antiproliferative drug absorbable polymer coat low rate MACE 4 year metal stent release drug durable polymer . The randomized LEADERS ( Limus Eluted A Durable versus ERodable Stent ) trial study show biolimus elute stent coat biodegradable polymer low risk adverse cardiac event associate late ST 5 year follow-up , improve long-term clinical outcome compare sirolimus-eluting stent coat durable polymer Bio-absorbable coat Rapamycin-Eluting Coronary Carbonized Stent The new Rapamycin-Eluting Coronary Stent System first carbonize stent completely biodegradable polymer coating contain rapamycin drug prevent early thrombotic re-stenotic event . Absorption carrier coat drug take place simultaneously within 6 week implantation , leave carbonize stent platform behind . Because biodegradable polymer base technology , duration dual antiplatelet therapy DES implantation might shorten month . The stent platform stainless stent receive CE-mark 2001 . It laser cut slot tube , multi-cellular design . The stent characterized carbon-ion implant layer ( Inert Carbon Technology ) become incorporate within metal lattice 0.05 mcm avoids leakage heavy-metal ion nickel molybdenum . Usually , heavy metal ion release stainless steel stent cause allergic inflammatory reaction might associate in-stent restenosis . Conversely , INERT-Technology alters common 316 stainless steel highly biocompatible alloy biodegradable polymer base sirolimus-eluting stent associate earlier neointimal healing compare permanent polymer base elute stent . After carbonize , stent coat thin layer biodegradable polymer ( PLGA ) . The coating clear stent 45 60 day degradation product ( lactic glycolic acid ) completely absorbed tissue within 90 day , leave inert bare metal stent , confirm preclinical animal test . This approach drug delivery artery aim achieve tissue coverage stent strut without excessive neointimal proliferation . Pre-clinical 'in vivo ' study show new Rapamycin-Eluting Coronary Stent System inhibit struts-associated inflammation neointimal formation porcine coronary model . Purpose The objective INERT study ass extent inflammation endothelial damage induce first carbonize bio-absorbable coated rapamycin-eluting coronary stent time percutaneous coronary intervention correlate extent abnormality short long-term clinical outcome post-procedural evaluation success . As part study , randomize sub-study carry Coordinating Center order compare biohumoral , clinical procedural finding patient carbonize bio-absorbable coated rapamycin-eluting coronary stent randomly assign receive stent different platform polymer .</detailed_description>
