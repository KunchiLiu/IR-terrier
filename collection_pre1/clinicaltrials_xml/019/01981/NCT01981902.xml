	<detailed_description>The research use low power laser technology take measurement muscle tissue water content volunteer marathon train run detect dehydration . Two slightly different device use detect dehydration . 1 ) . diffuse optical spectroscopy 2 ) . spatial frequency domain imaging-modulated image The researcher determine use method assess level dehydration status runner . These method include take weight temperature run , skin-fold measurement pre post run , obtain saliva sample run . The researcher determine study use non-invasive , laser light technology measure tissue water concentration , indicator dehydration .</detailed_description>
