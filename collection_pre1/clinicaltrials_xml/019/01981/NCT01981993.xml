	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Early diagnosis prognostication acute kidney injury patient sepsis key understanding disease evaluation new intervention condition . Many urinary biomarkers propose , single one seem consistently provide additional information top clinical routine biochemical parameter . Some author propose use panel urinary biomarkers increase accuracy However , approach far test large group patient sepsis . In addition , new performant analytical technique develop warrant test clinical field . PATIENTS AND METHODS : At least 150 consecutive patient admit tertiary care intensive care unit ( ICU ) sepsis include . After bladder catheterisation , urinary sample collect time point 0 , 4 hour 24 hour admission , daily day 1-5 . Samples immediately centrifuge frozen -80Â°C analysis . Samples extract remove large protein ( &gt; 20kDa ) de-salting step prior mass spectrometry analysis . Investigators use capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry ( CE-MS ) ass urinary peptide predictive AKI : 20 peptide constitute AKI marker pattern previously establish cohort ICU patient . Simultaneously , sample analyse use matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF MS ) , alternative platform CE-MS , currently develop routine ICU use . A proof concept technique involve successfully apply set urine sample patient diagnose diabetes present normoalbuminuria ( control ) macroalbuminuria ( case ) . Clinical , demographic biochemical data patient collect first 5 day . PATIENT OUTCOME - short term : - development acute kidney injury accord RIFLE criterion - death - need renal replacement therapy ICU stay - long term - death - need renal replacement therapy - estimate glomerular filtration rate calculate MDRD 3 month , 1 year 2 year . Using cut-offs , Receiver Operating Characteristics curve , negative positive predictive value use describe diagnostic performance biomarker panel alone , combination basic clinical and/or routine biochemical parameter . Univariate multivariate logistic regression death use evaluate prognostication value biomarker set . In addition , new discriminatory cut-offs proteomic pattern determine recent proteomic analysis technique determine training set ( half cohort ) validate half cohort . Using MALDI-TOF MS platform , investigator assess urinary peptide predictive AKI training set ( ca . 75 patient ) good diagnostic performance marker panel ( accuracy 0.8 ) . Performance biomarker panel assess blinded test set ca . 75 patient evaluate validity model AKI detection .</brief_summary>
