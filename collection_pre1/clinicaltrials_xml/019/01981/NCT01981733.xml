	<brief_summary>The THRIVE-1 study examine novel method enhance blood flow lower limb use electrical stimulation . Increases low limb blood flow improve venous return thereby reduce venous stasis . Since stasis one compounding factor development deep vein thrombosis , risk develop thrombosis theoretically proportionally reduce . This technique may prove useful tool prevent reduce incidence deep vein thrombosis medical surgical patient together passenger undertake significant duration travel ( travel - related deep vein thrombosis exclusively related fly ) .</brief_summary>
