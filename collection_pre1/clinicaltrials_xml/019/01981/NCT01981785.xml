	<brief_summary>The immune system intricate system comprise specialized cell , protein , tissue organ . Proper function critical body 's ability defend harmful pathogen . Immunological disorder deficiency defect immune system lead abnormal immune response . Abnormal immune response could derive immune deficiency , dysregulations hypersensitivity . The overall goal research study identify mechanism primary immune deficiency immune disorder genetic , cellular molecular level , use novel analytic technique perform immune cell derive blood sample . The knowledge gain aim study could lead good diagnostics identify novel target therapeutic intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary immunodeficiency disease ( PID ) represent class disorder instrinsic defect human immune system . The PID could cause defect perturbation either innate adaptive immune cell , B cell defect result lack antibody . Research topic remain difficult feat due factor genetic heterogeneity gene-environment interface . Limitations standard care test lead many patient immunological problem undiagnosed . In addition variety primary immune deficiency , large number immune system disorder due various perturbation immunological component cause disease much great prevalence autoimmune disease , lymphoproliferative disease , chronic inflammation certain cancer . The cause immune disorder typically complex PID also many overlap immune hyper-activation deficiency .</detailed_description>
