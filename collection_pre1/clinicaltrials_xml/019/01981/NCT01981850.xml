	<brief_summary>PRM-151 investigational drug develop possible use treatment myelofibrosis ( MF ) , disease bone marrow , organ body make blood cell , replace fibrosis , excess scar tissue . The purpose study gather information whether PRM-151 effect MF disease , whether safe patient MF , well tolerate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Of PRM-151 In Subjects With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stage 2 study ongoing . Stage 2 randomize , double-blind Phase 2 study determine efficacy safety three different dos PRM-151 subject PMF post ET/PV MF . Subjects randomize one three dos : 0.3 mg/kg , 3.0 mg/kg 10 mg/kg PRM-151 . This second stage adaptive design study define FDA Draft Guidance Industry : Adaptive Design Clinical Trials Drugs Biologics , February 2010 . Modifications dose level , schedule , regimen make Stage 2 base data Stage 1 . Stage 1 study complete . Stage 1 open-label , Simon two stage , Phase 2 study determine efficacy safety two different dose schedule PRM-151 subject PMF post ET/PV MF . There two treatment cohort , assign one two dose schedule PRM-151 . Subjects assign weekly every four week dose schedule investigator .</detailed_description>
