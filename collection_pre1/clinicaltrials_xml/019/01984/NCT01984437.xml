	<detailed_description>The objective study allow physician use commercially available Magellan Robotic System Magellan Robotic Catheters navigate treatment target peripheral vasculature : - Determine number endovascular procedure consecutively perform Magellan Robotic System navigate treatment target peripheral vasculature , - Achieve stable efficient system preparation set-up time , navigation cannulation time target vessel endovascular procedure , placement therapeutic equipment use perform endovascular procedure . - Achieve stable reduce fluoroscopy time endovascular procedure . - Determine number case require reach `` steady state , '' reduction predictable time conduct peripheral interventional procedure use descriptive ( mean , range ) statistic analyze data . Design This prospective retrospective , multi-center , single arm , non-blinded , sequentially enrol data collection activity ( Hansen Medical provide funding ) . Only patient schedule undergo endovascular procedure use Magellan Robotic System approach enrollment . Methods Registry procedure conduct accordance label indication use Magellan™ Robotic System . Prior physician participate registry prior subject enrollment , participate physician require complete Hansen Medical 's Magellan Robotic System training . Participating registry site must commercially available Magellan Robotic System treatment patient . Data Management Participating site assign specific site numeric identification code registry sponsor . The information collect registry data related procedure Magellan System use plan used may include patient follow-up data , minimally 14 day ( ± 5 day ) post procedure also may include 30 day follow-up ass resolution procedural post procedure adverse event . The database repository collect registry data data make available ( extractable format ) physician participant . Adverse Events The data submit reviewed regular basis safety issue complaint . Adverse event and/or complaint deem reportable submit appropriate regulatory agency/agencies Hansen Medical , Inc .</detailed_description>
