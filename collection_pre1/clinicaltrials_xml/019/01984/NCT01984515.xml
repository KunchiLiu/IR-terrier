	<brief_title>Increasing Engagement Evidence-Based PTSD Therapy Primary Care Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within Veteran 's Health Administration ( VHA ) , primary care ( PC ) patient PTSD low rate engagement evidence-based psychotherapy ( EBP ) PTSD . Low engagement rate due variety patient-level ( e.g. , belief treatment helpful , stigma ) system-level barrier ( e.g. , lack track referral process , knowledge gap manage PTSD ) . We propose conduct pilot hybrid effectiveness- implementation study implement evidence-based Referral Management System ( RMS ) address patient system-level barrier uptake EBP PTSD VHA primary care patient . RMS address patient-level barrier delivery 1-session cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) intervention identify change treatment seek belief serve barrier treatment engagement , include specific negative belief EBP ( e.g. , talk past trauma difficult '' ) . This CBT intervention previously find effective increase treatment engagement Veterans PTSD . Depending Veteran preference , deliver PC-MHI provider within PC clinic Behavioral Health Lab ( BHL ) care manager phone . RMS initiate PACT staff address system-level barrier BHL technician track progress RMS referral contact Veterans follow think chosen referral option . PACT staff also train simple script address PTSD symptom make appropriate referral base VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines PTSD . Our aim , implementation strategy , data collection , analyse guide established strategy . The Consolidated Framework Implementation Research ( CFIR ) identify organization variable . RE-AIM investigate program uptake patient/ system-level impact . An Implementation Mapping approach guide implementation strategy . We propose conduct study 3 phase . Phase 1 include interview PC MH leadership relevance CFIR construct RMS implementation meeting PACT staff train RMS gather input RMS adapt clinic . A PC medical provider serve clinical champion knowledgeable , communicative , leader promote RMS among his/her peer . Phase 2 consists implement RMS 6 month one Syracuse PC clinic measure RE-AIM outcome . Some RE-AIM outcome compare participant receive RMS receive RMS historical control group . Phase 3 involves meet PACT MH Leadership PACT staff share formal report study result gather information potential barrier facilitator long-term maintenance future expansion RMS within CFIR framework . An expert national stakeholder panel also convene guide development SDP investigate multi-VISN implementation . Our long-term aim line research increase implementation evidence-based psychotherapy PTSD get primary care patient PTSD engage treatment . Our Specific Aims Rapid Response Project : 1 . Assess improve feasibility implement RMS PC-MHI/PACT setting 1A . Diagnose organizational staff-level barrier facilitator implement RMS . 1B . Adapt RMS local context base information gather barrier facilitator . 2 . Evaluate initial impact implement RMS PC-MHI/PACT setting . Assess impact RMS RE-AIM measure Reach , Efficacy/Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation Maintenance 3 . Refine implementation strategy base study finding plan effort spread RMS additional VISNs QUERI Phase 2 Service-Directed Project ( SDP ) follow .</detailed_description>
