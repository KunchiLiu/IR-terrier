	<brief_summary>As spinal cord injure population age , individual expose increase prevalence age-associated disease , couple secondary complication injury may contribute reduced life expectancy . Decentralized autonomic regulation person SCI result multitude cardiovascular change , may contribute accelerate age . Adverse cardiovascular change may deleterious effect cerebral blood flow dynamic increase cerebral vascular resistance index individual SCI cognitive testing . Deficits memory process speed individual SCI may relate cardiovascular cerebrovascular dysfunction . Identifying association healthy age versus premature accelerate age organ system function SCI population important first step towards prevention amelioration change . Therefore study objective compare , among individual SCI , age-matched non-SCI old non-SCI individual arterial stiffness cerebral vascular resistance index ; memory , process speed , executive function ; volume white matter hyperintensities . 60 individual SCI , 30 age-matched non-SCI control , 20 old non-SCI control recruit study . All potential subject undergo two-part screening process consist initial screen via telephone detail , in-person screening . Eligible subject invite participate 4 hour laboratory visit arterial stiffness , blood pressure , heart rate , respiration rate , blood flow brain monitor rest comprehensive series cognitive test . A subset participant ask take part MRI brain image session : 40 person SCI , 10 age-matched non-SCI 10 old non-SCI . Eligible subject ask participate 1 hour MRI/functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) session . We hypothesize arterial stiffness cerebral vascular resistance index increase SCI group compare age-matched non-SCI comparable old non-SCI group . In addition , hypothesize prevalence mild moderate cognitive impairment memory , process speed , executive function increase SCI individual compare age-matched non-SCI comparable old non-SCI individual .</brief_summary>
