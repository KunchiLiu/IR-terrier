	<brief_summary>Cardiac catheterization important test evaluation cardiac patient . Since begin cardiac catheterization procedure , use femoral artery puncture gateway procedure . Recently use often path radial . Using approach gain many follower worldwide use almost routinely country gain popularity many interventional cardiologist argue transradial procedure much time-consuming difficult . Research question : Are difference total procedure time path radial femoral vascular perform cardiac catheterization ? . This research focus search information determine whether significant difference variable study . This research justify need evaluate two technique use lack study evaluate compare radial arterial access comparison femoral access route widely use service hemodynamics national international . The lack research subject make use transradial procedure routinely do , idea much time-consuming technically difficult procedure perform femoral approach , hence Hemodynamics specialist , everyone want start implement systematic use radial approach cardiac catheterization studies.The main objective project determine non-inferiority term total procedure time path radial femoral vascular perform cardiac catheterization . Secondary objective : difference time puncture , duration procedure recovery . Incidence vascular complication technique radial femoral , presence complication 8 day follow-up . Our aim check result , difference variable favor either two technique determine non-inferiority one technique term ease effectiveness procedure . The type study control clinical trial open , randomize , non-inferiority . The study population consist patient tell diagnostic cardiac catheterization , send General Clinic Northern institution .</brief_summary>
