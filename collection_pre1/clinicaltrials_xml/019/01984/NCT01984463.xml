	<brief_summary>This study design assess impact epidural morphine : - The incidence severity shoulder pain follow thoracotomy . - The need additional analgesic , opioids relief shoulder pain . - Its safety profile compare epidural fentanyl follow thoracotomy . The basic hypothesis study infusion epidural bupivacaine morphine initiate induction anesthesia continue 72 hour postoperatively reduce incidence severity shoulder pain follow thoracotomy compare epidural infusion bupivacaine fentanyl .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Epidural Morphine Shoulder Pain Following Thoracotomy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite adequate epidural analgesia , 97 % patient undergoing thoracotomy experience ipsilateral shoulder pain . Although pain well recognize , cause remain unclear . Several mechanism suggest explain pain , include somatic visceral well phrenic nerve nociception . The phrenic nerve arises third fifth cervical nerve provide sensory innervation mediastinal diaphragmatic pleura pericardium . Patients complain constant , moderate severe ache pain , posterior deltoid suprascapular region , ipsilateral surgery . Different treatment use alleviate post-thoracotomy shoulder pain , effort proven effective safe . A mixture epidural bupivacaine fentanyl consider standard care post-thoracotomy analgesia center . The infusion start induction anesthesia bolus dose follow continuous infusion bolus dos need following day . To optimize use epidural analgesia thoracotomy , would seem well-advised try reach high dermatome . This could possibly achieve use different opioid combination bupivacaine epidural infusion . Morphine could interest agent order reach cervical spinous dermatome probably involved genesis post-thoracotomy shoulder pain . Methods : The anesthetic technique monitoring standardize . Prior induction general anesthesia , thoracic epidural catheter insert local anesthesia fourth eight spinous process . Correct placement epidural assess . A bolus dose fentanyl 100 mcg morphine 3 mg give epidural catheter per randomization . The epidural infusion initiate rate 0.1 mL/kg/hr surgery continue postoperatively surgical drain remove maximum five day . To relieve thoracic pain , epidural infusion rate adjust maximum 12 mL/hr , boluses 0.05 mL/kg need . Hydromorphone use postoperatively rescue analgesia shoulder pain . All patient receive standardise dos acetaminophen first 48 hour follow surgery . On arrival recovery room , correct placement epidural reassess . During immediate postoperative period , intensity pain assess use Verbal Numeric Pain Scale ( 0-10 ) . Pain assess 2,4,8,12 24 hour surgery daily thereafter , total duration 4 postoperative day . Interference pain daily activity assess use Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) 24 hour follow surgery . Signs neuropathic pain assess use Leeds Assessment Neuropathic Symptoms Signs ( LANSS ) scale 24 hour follow surgery . Side-effects attributable analgesia record . Arterial blood sample collect every 8 hour first 24 hour postoperatively .</detailed_description>
