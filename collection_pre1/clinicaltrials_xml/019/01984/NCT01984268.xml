	<detailed_description>The standard treatment rheumatoid arthritis use disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug methotrexate control joint pain swell . Often time rheumatoid arthritis patient experience inadequate response methotrexate acute persistent joint pain swell . In patient , alternative additional immunosuppressive therapy need induce disease remission .
