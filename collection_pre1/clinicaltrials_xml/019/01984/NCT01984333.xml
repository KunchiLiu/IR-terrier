	<detailed_description>Although trichotillomania ( TTM ) , impulse control disorder characterize compulsive hair pulling , typically result serious consequence include impaired individual functioning , medical problem ( e.g. , skin infection ) , elevate comorbidity psychiatric disorder , remain one poorly-understood inadequately-treated psychiatric condition . There urgent need effective accessible clinical intervention TTM , especially young individual suffer mark lack adequate treatment resource despite early onset condition . One promising therapeutic approach improve cognitive problem believe contribute TTM , use computerized cognitive retraining method . Research indicate impaired response inhibition ( RI ; ability inhibit inappropriate potent response ) important cognitive feature underlie TTM . Therefore , RI consider important target cognitive retraining . Investigators develop computerized training program aim improve RI capability format online video game . Fifty child TTM randomly assign ( ) online 8-session RIT ( n=25 ) , ( b ) 1-month waitlist condition ( n = 25 ) , assessed baseline , post-treatment , 1-month follow-up . The waitlisted participant also invite undergo training program 1-month follow-up assessment complete . Investigators hypothesize online RIT show great improvement TTM symptom RI capabilities post-treatment 1-month follow-up assessment , compare waitlist condition . This study expect generate important data guide development accessible , cost-efficient , effective cognitive intervention individual suffer TTM .</detailed_description>
