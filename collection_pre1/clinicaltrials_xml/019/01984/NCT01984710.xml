	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder common disease . For many people , conventional treatment antidepressant helpful relieve symptoms condition . But many 30 % patient depression le full response become resistant conventional treatment . When treatment resistance develop , depression become chronic disease significant burden morbidity mortality . The reason patient develop Treatment Resistant Depression ( TRD ) know . One current theory depression result dysfunction network region brain treatment resistant patient network permanently stick dysfunctional state . We investigate experimental treatment treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) , base network theory know subcallosal deep brain stimulation ( SCC DBS ) . This treatment involve placement electrode specific region brain ( subcallosal cingulate cortex , area 25 ) stimulate area electricity , reset regulation network result significant antidepressant response . While still experimental result suggest may eventually useful treatment patient TRD . The experiment describe application use new DBS device record electrical activity brain around site stimulation . The electrical activity know Latent Field Potential ( LFP ) reflection activity neural network . The new DBS device experimental device approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , allow simultaneous record LFP stimulation deliver . The device manufacture Medtronics known Activa Primary Cell + Sensing ( PC+S ) , use record brain electrical activity also know `` Brain Radio '' . The Brain Radio base approve device commonly use DBS condition add sensor capacity . The stimulation system identical approve device . The goal investigation use Brain Radio study LFP brain people TRD active stimulation . The ultimate goal understand neural network cause TRD change DBS cause network result antidepressant effect . We recruit 10 patient advanced TRD implant Brain Radio system . The recording system record LFP 3 year , patient receive stimulation . A brief discontinuation study conduct 6 month stimulation device turn pattern LFP change record . All LFP measure correlate primary clinical response outcome metric , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale . The knowledge gain experiment invaluable understand basic pathology depression antidepressant response .

INTRODUCTION Deep brain stimulation subcallosal cingulate white matter ( SCC25 DBS ) investigate new interventional strategy treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) . In addition grow evidence long-term antidepressant efficacy chronic stimulation , immediate change mood , attention , psychomotor speed intra-operative test repeatedly observe . These acute , electrode contact-specific behavioral effect successfully guide selection optimal contact chronic DBS . The presence intraoperative behavioral effect often predictive long-term outcome . It clear sustain high frequency stimulation appear require maintain antidepressant response long-term , discontinuation even several year remission associate deterioration return depression symptom several week . Imaging study examine effect chronic SCC25 DBS use positron emission tomography ( PET ) demonstrate change blood flow metabolism vicinity DBS target , remotely frontal cortex , ventral striatum , hypothalamus amygdala/hippocampus . These finding , combine recent diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) study , provide evidence anatomical functional extent regional change mediate antidepressant effect DBS time [ 5-6 ] . Brain change mediate observe intra-operative behavioral change discontinuation-precipitated relapse unknown . To date , none study able address explicit mechanism DBS TRD neuronal level , chronic stimulation . It possible make measurement neuronal activity available record system intraoperative testing . Given TRD require chronic stimulation achieve full remission , characterization change neural activity throughout duration stimulation development therapeutic response invaluable develop refine treatment modality . Furthermore , track neural change behavioral correlate chronic stimulation control discontinuation would allow characterization physiologic marker potential use feedback signal treatment development optimization . This set new experiment build past experience utilize SCC25 DBS patient TRD explore potential neural correlate antidepressant response . This do use ActivaPC+S , prototype DBS system develop Medtronic combine conventional DBS brain electrode pulse generator sense device chronically read , record download electrical brain activity know Local Field Potential ( LFP ) brain area surround DBS electrode . These recording download implanted device external antenna device similar device use control pulse generator . Given ability record LFP locally brain transmit information receive station ActivaPC+S device refer `` Brain Radio '' . The ActivaPC+S , `` Brain Radio '' device experimental system currently approve FDA . This device base ActivaPC system , FDA approval use Parkinson 's disease , Essential Tremor Humanitarian Device Exemption ( HDE ) Dystonia . The ActivaPC also HDE use intractable Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) . The Brain Radio sense technology addition standard stimulation capacity approve device allows real time record LFP anatomical location electrode active stimulation stimulation . As powerful research tool facilitate investigation neuronal change associate antidepressant response chronic DBS . This first ever use unique , cut edge system human patient treatment resistant depression potential provide unprecedented insight fundamental neuronal process underlie depressive illness antidepressant response . Hypothesis 1 : Aberrant oscillation SCC-prefrontal circuitry present TRD patient . SCC25 DBS exert therapeutic effect alter network dynamic . Behavioral improvement TRD patient treat SCC25 DBS correlate discernible LFP change specific DBS electrode contact , acutely chronically . Hypothesis 2 : Stable maintenance stimulation-induced LFP change require sustained antidepressant response , loss change herald impend depression relapse . This study test hypotheses 10 TRD patient via record LFPs ActivaPC+S system throughout course chronic SCC25 DBS . Measures SCC LFP oscillatory activity correlate clinical measure antidepressant response scalp EEG signal . OBJECTIVES Experiment # 1 : To quantify electrophysiological change , behavioral correlate EEG change month follow implantation stimulator turn OFF . Experiment # 1A : To characterize LFP change 48 hour post op response brief , acute stimulation patient receive implantation procedure Experiment # 1B : To characterize change LFP pattern month implantation establish baseline chronic stimulation initiate . The Activa PC+S system utilized record LFP phase protocol . Experiment # 2 : The stimulator turn 1 month implantation . This experiment occur day stimulation initiation . Clinical data record LFP change capture Activa PC+S system scalp EEG . The stimulator cycle series different frequency current setting LFPs record . Experiments # 3 : To quantify LFP change response chronic high frequency SCC25 stimulation correlate change pattern long-term antidepressant response EEG pattern . Stimulation initiate one month implantation maintain chronically subsequent 6 month . Clinical assessment , LFP scalp EEG routinely record 6-month period . Experiment # 4 : To quantify LFP change stimulation briefly stop ( 1 week ) 6 month chronic stimulation . Correlation make LFP , clinical/ symptomatic change EEG pattern . Experiment # 5 : To quantify LFP change extend period exposure chronic high frequency SCC25 stimulation . Clinical response EEG pattern record every 6 month compare LFP battery life ActivaPC+S system ; currently estimate 3 5 year initiation stimulation .
