	<detailed_description>Subjects consider enrollment study identify approach either Principal Investigator train study coordinator ( SC ) . Candidates enrollment individual present sign and/or symptom Acute Coronary Syndrome Henry Ford Hospital Emergency Department ( ED ) . This specimen collection study prospective serial draw plasma collection study design collect specimen use exist future clinical study . Specimen collection expect take approximately 30-36 month . Specimens collect subject evaluate Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) . Other sample collection , special procedure medication require study . The study aim enroll approximately 250-500 individual evaluate possible ACS ED . Specimens obtain subject following time point : t0 =Baseline ECG ( ECG time + 60 minute ) t1= within 30 ( +/- 10 minute ) minute t0 t2 = 1 ( +/- 15 minute ) hour t0 t3 = 3 ( +/-15 minute ) hour t0 Each sample consist approximately 6-8.5 ml blood two anticoagulant tube type : SST K2EDTA plasma . Four serial specimen collect within 3 hour presentation ED observation ACS . - The Investigator designee obtain subject 's write informed consent prior collect specimen . - Each subject give unique study number . An enrollment log use document enrollment individual study number . This study number use identify individual throughout study . - Each subject medical history review document , well significant cardiac medical history document subject 's case report form addition demographic information include age , gender , race , ethnicity , medication history . - Each subject baseline ECG obtain ED , vital sign routine laboratory result . These document subject 's case report form . - Approximately 6-8.5 ml blood collect two anticoagulant tube type : SST K2EDTA plasma . The first blood collection ED designate t0 ED ECG time ( + 60 minute ) . Additional blood draw approximately 6-8.5 mL/tube type occur t1 = 30 ( +/- 10 minute ) t0 , t2=1 ( +/-15 minute ) hour t0 , t4 = 3 ( +/- 15 minute ) hour t0 ( patient still ED/hospital ) . - For draw , minimum volume ( process ) approximately 2 mL plasma obtain . The specimen process , aliquoted , retain -70 secure freezer . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria : - Patient great 21 year age - Experiencing symptom possible ACS - Willing able comply aspect protocol Exclusion Criteria : - Acute distress and/or require immediate life-saving intervention - CPR , external defibrillation cardioversion within 24 hour presentation - Unable provide understand inform consent - STEMI lead immediate reperfusion - Transferred another facility - Trauma related injury - Pregnancy breast feed</detailed_description>
