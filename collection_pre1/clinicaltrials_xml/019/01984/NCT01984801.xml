	<brief_summary>The propose indication GSK1940029 topical treatment acne , early clinical plan evaluate irritation potential GSK1940029 ( Study SCD117225 - 3 Part study ) ; safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics GSK1940029 ( Study SCD117226 - 2 Part study ) , topical administration healthy subject acne patient . Study SCD117225 randomize , single-blind , three part study , evaluate primary irritation potential ( Part 1 ) , cumulative irritation potential ( Part 2 ) two concentration GSK1940029 gel apply intact skin healthy subject , facial irritation potential one two concentration GSK1940029 apply face acne patient ( Part3 ) . In Part 1 Part 2 follow 6 treatment apply use individual patch : ( A ) 200 milligram ( mg ) 0.3 % GSK1940029 gel , ( B ) 200 mg 1 % GSK1940029 gel , ( C ) 200 mg 0.3 % /1 % vehicle gel ( vehicle control ) , ( D ) 200 microliters ( µL ) sterile distil water ( negative irritant control ) , ( E ) 200 µL - 0.5 % sodium lauryl sulfate ( SLS ) sterile distil water Part 1/0.1 % SLS sterile distil water Part 2 ( positive irritant control ) , ( F ) Patch ( patch control ) . Each treatment randomize one six designated location either upper arm location , low upper back , within subject . The treatment reapplied location subsequent day . Each treatment apply daily 2 day Part 1 , daily 21 day Part 2 . In Part 3 , patient apply thin coat one two concentration GSK1940029 gel vehicle acne affect facial/neck skin hand , daily 28 day . Parts within Study SCD117225 Study SCD117226 interdependency . No significant primary irritation signal Study SCD117225 Part 1 would allow initiation Study SCD117226 Part 1 ( single dose application ) . Once safety , tolerability exposure information determine Study SCD117226 Part 1 , Part 2 Study SCD117225 may initiate along Part 2 ( 14-day repeat dose application ) . No significant cumulative irritation signal ( study SCD117225 Part 2 ) combination adequate 14-day safety ( study SCD117226 Part 2 ) would allow initiation Part 3 Study SCD117225 .</brief_summary>
