	<brief_summary>Persistent pain major challenge patient undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) relate fatigue , physical disability , poor quality life , poor medical adherence . There need examine strategy manage pain HSCT patient complement exist analgesic regimen . Strong evidence suggest cognitive behavioral factor play important role HSCT patient ' ability manage pain . The investigator find HSCT patient low level confidence ( i.e. , self-efficacy ) ability control pain high use maladaptive coping strategy ( i.e. , pain catastrophizing ) experience increase pain disability . A psychosocial intervention modifies patient ' cognitive behavioral pain cop strategy may benefit HSCT patient . Protocols , particularly Pain Coping Skills Training ( PCST ) , develop reduce pain improve quality life patient persistent pain . However , HSCT patient persistent pain face number unique challenge must consider apply PCST protocol . The investigator propose develop test Mobile Health Pain Coping Skills ( mPCST ) protocol HSCT patient persistent pain meet challenge HSCT patient pain transition hospital base care home environment . The first aim study use iterative development model design mPCST intervention protocol HSCT patient target increase self-efficacy pain control decrease pain catastrophizing . The study team use focus group patient HSCT provider guide development along user test HSCT patient pain . The second aim study use small randomized control trial examine feasibility , acceptability , engagement develop mPCST protocol . The third aim obtain estimate effect size develop mPCST protocol decrease pain , pain disability , physical disability , adherence post-transplant lifestyle recommendation impact pain compare standard care control condition . Proposed innovative feature mPCST protocol develop include : extensive input PCST HSCT expert HSCT patient pain ; initial session prior discharge subsequent session occur home via video-conferencing ; incorporation strategy decrease impact pain adherence critical post-transplant lifestyle recommendation ; real-time daily assessment system subsequent tailor feedback . If develop mPCST protocol demonstrate feasibility , acceptability , engagement , promise effect size influence pain index quality life , large NIH grant seek examine protocol large sample patient , test protocol active treatment , investigate broad array outcome ( e.g. , medication adherence ) . This mPCST protocol could also examine patient population pain face similar challenge ( e.g. , live far medical center , travel limitation ) .</brief_summary>
