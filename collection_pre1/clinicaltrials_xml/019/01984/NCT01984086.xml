	<brief_summary>This open-label , two part , six period- cross , randomise , single dose , single centre study healthy subject . This first clinical study UD-DPI . This study divide two part . Part A ascertain whether pharmacokinetic ( PK ) salbutamol deliver via UD-DPI comparable salbutamol deliver via Diskus MDI . For reason four treatment dos consist three dose strength two percentage blend assess Part A delivered via UD-DPI . Part A also provide preliminary PK variability estimate allow well sample size/precision calculation Part B . Part B explore whether UD-DPI pharmacokinetic exposure profile comparable either Diskus MDI presence charcoal block .</brief_summary>
