	<detailed_description>Patients enrol dose level undergo routine evaluation identify potential toxicity well functional voice analysis . Adequate wait period use ensure fraction reduction proceed prior observe toxicity . The purpose study either determine maximal fraction reduction possible dose reach dose-limiting toxicity occur . The initial dose fractionation 50 Gy 15 fraction goal reduce number fraction dose 42.5 Gy 5 fraction . The rationale use 5 fraction tolerate centrally locate lung tumor dose 50 Gy 5 fraction , thus , likely tolerate large calliber airway .</detailed_description>
