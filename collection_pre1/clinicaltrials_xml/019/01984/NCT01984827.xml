	<brief_summary>High blood glucose level ( hyperglycaemia ) Moxifloxacin ( commonly use antibiotic ) show independently affect heart activity healthy volunteer record ECG . i.e . Both cause prolongation QTc interval measure time start Qwave end Twave heartbeat cycle . In study , investigator want find whether moxifloxacin hyperglycaemia cause QTc prolongation Type 1 diabetic patient . The investigator also want assess whether C-peptide ( fragment insulin normally find blood present present blood Type 1 diabetic ) opposite effect heart activity i.e shorten QTc interval reverse effect QTc prolongation Type 1 diabetes may useful prevent 'dead bed ' syndrome also know 'Sudden Cardiac Death ' common diabetic patient compare healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Glucose QTc Interval Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator previous research ( Taubel et al. , 2013 ) show healthy individual glucose prolong ( C-peptide antagonising effect ) QT interval , long use clinical index duration ventricular repolarisation . This observation warrant serious attention suggest high glucose level may pro-arrhythmogenic . To investigate whether glucose effect cardiac repolarisation , would advantageous test environment uncomplicated C-peptide . In order elucidate effect glucose QTc absence C-peptide , investigator use diabetic patient longer able release endogenous C-peptide . This allow well understand whether ( 1 ) well establish QTc prolongation cause moxifloxacin exaggerated elevated level blood glucose , would important evaluate risk diabetic patient use IKr block drug moxifloxacin , ( 2 ) investigate whether C-peptide substitution reverse attenuate effect presence moxifloxacin . Using condition formal TQT study , investigator would also want confirm QTc prolonging effect describe Gordin et al . ( 2008 ) whether set C-Peptide substitution reverse attenuate glucose effect QTc . This phase I , single centre , randomise , placebo-controlled , open-label , crossover study design evaluate effect glucose C-peptide cardiac repolarisation use hyperglycaemic clamp single 400 mg dose moxifloxacin positive control non-elderly male female patient type I diabetes . The result study form basis decision future study . This study perform compliance protocol , ICH GCP applicable regulatory requirement include EU GMP requirement investigational medicinal product ( ) ( IMPs ) .</detailed_description>
