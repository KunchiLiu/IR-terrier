	<brief_title>CPR Prediction After Neoadjuvant Using Excisional Biopsy By Radiofrequency In Breast Cancer From II-III UICC Stages .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer set least 4 different disease , currently know intrinsic genomic subtypes . Two so-called HER2-enriched , characterize HER-2 oncogene amplification , basal-like , correlate closely triple negative tumor ( TNBC ) . These subtypes sensitive primary medical treatment ( neoadjuvant Presurgical ) . The use modern medical treatment initial treatment , allow complete disappearance cancer breast axilla ( pathologic complete response , CPR ) 40 % patient TNBC around 60 % patient HER2-positive tumor stage II III . The need local surgery patient tumor disappear completely ( CPR ) primary medical treatment , recently question , improvement clear radiotherapy could sufficient assure locoregional disease control . The use conventional diagnostic technique ( MRI , ultrasound , mammography PET ) enough reliable determine pathological complete response , make difficult adopt attitude surgical abstention . The existence minimally invasive technique could reliably determine absence cancer primary medical treatment surgery , could avoid surgery case . Percutaneous biopsy guide ultrasound radiofrequency technique allow complete resection breast lesion 2 cm diameter minimal aggression mammary gland area initial tumor neoadjuvant treatment . Several study report use technique patient breast cancer . Results show good tolerability technique patient suggest would reduce need re-excision , also reduce rate local recurrence due radiation absence . Biopsy use radiofrequency could useful confirm CPR patient triple-negative HER2-positive tumor several luminal B tumor good response previously determine conventional method ( MR particular ) . Despite , new prospective study analyse reliability patient selection CPR could avoid traditional surgery need . To confirm hypothesis , group 100 treat patient unicentered tumor stage II III good response determine MR 6 cycle treatment ( le 2 cm apparent residual injury ) consecutively subject radiofrequency biopsy surgery previously establish case ( Tumorectomy mastectomy ) . Before surgery , sentinel node biopsied order define surgical treatment axilla ( none case negative sentinel node , axillary lymphadenectomy positive ) . The tumor sample obtain percutaneous radiofrequency mastectomy-Tumorectomy biopsy study thoroughly define correlation two .</detailed_description>
