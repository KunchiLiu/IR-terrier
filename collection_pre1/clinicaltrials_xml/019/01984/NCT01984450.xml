	<brief_summary>Study Title : A study compare two articular cartilage repair technique knee joint : Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis ( ACIC ) Vs. Mesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis ( MCIC ) . Study hypothesis : We start hypothesis treatment equally effective . Trial Design : This prospective study . The participate patient divide two group , group receive either one treatment modality . This study randomise blind . Both procedure do Spire Alexandra Hospital Professor A . A Shetty , one half team devise technique . Trial Participants : All participant patient attend Professor Shetty 's clinic Spire Alexandra Hospital . Planned Sample Size : 50 patient arm . Follow-up duration : The participate patient follow 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year 2 year follow surgery visit clinic assess clinically . The surgical outcome measure IKDC , KOOS Lysholm score ; cartilage growth measure MOCART score . Planned Trial Period : Two three year Primary Objective : To establish superiority , , either procedure . Primary Endpoint : At end 2 year follow participating patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Two Techniques Articular Cartilage Repair : ACIC Vs. MCIC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Articular cartilage repair knee aim young patient area ( ) cartilage loss deformity knee . These patient n't indicate knee replacement . Articular cartilage repair lead improvement symptom pain , lock function . Traditionally , articular cartilage repair always involve expose entire knee joint arthrotomy . This , though effective , would lead large scar , long hospital stay , long rehabilitation associate complication . Also , use Bone Marrow Aspirate Cells ( BMAC ) purpose cartilage repair long debate side valid argument good surgical result . RATIONALE : Both procedure study perform one stage , arthroscopically day case procedure , offer minimal scar quicker recovery . This automatically confer significant advantage traditional surgical technique . To correct articular cartilage defect , ACIC method require autologous Atellocollagen ( protein base structure ) , MCIC method use concentrate BMAC take patient 's iliac crest . Both procedure show encouraging result term pain relief , cartilage growth improve function . Since one technique utilise protein base reagent involves mesenchymal cell , study aim ascertain either technique superior . STUDY DESIGN : This study aim compare two technique articular cartilage repair knee , namely Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis ( ACIC ) Mesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis ( MCIC ) . The principal objective ascertain assess superiority , , either surgical technique . The superiority assess certain score system ( IKDC , KOOS , Lysholm MOCART ) measure pre- post-operatively . Depending procedure patient chooses , allot either ACIC MCIC group . The patient follow clinic Spire Alexandra Hospital 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year 2 year follow surgery progress document questionnaire clinical examination . MRI scan do one two year assess extent cartilage growth . SURGICAL TECHNIQUES Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis ( ACIC ) : ACIC single stage arthroscopic procedure . It do day case ? procedure patient admit hour procedure . The anaesthetic method depend Anaesthesiologist 's prerogative depend patient 's general health . Under sterile condition operate theatre , arthroscopic instrument introduce inside knee joint . As assessed previously MRI scan , area cartilage defect debrided curettage , shave burring microfractured . The ACIC method utilise autologous Atellocollagen , protein base structure , mixed thrombin fibrinogen form gel coat area cartilage defect . The entry port close knee cover sterile dressing . The patient transfer surgical recovery ward , medically stable , transferred room ward . After discharge hospital , patient advise partial weight bearing operate leg 6 week surgery . They also undergo 5 session physiotherapy . Surgical clip suture remove 2 week follow surgery . Mesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis ( MCIC ) : MCIC single stage arthroscopic procedure . It do day case ? procedure patient admit hour procedure . The anaesthetic method depend Anaesthesiologist 's prerogative depend patient 's general health . Under sterile condition operate theatre , arthroscopic instrument introduce inside knee joint . As assessed previously MRI scan , area cartilage defect debrided curettage , shave burring microfractured . The MCIC method involve aspiration Bone Marrow Aspirate Cells ( BMAC ) patient 's iliac crest ( hip bone ) concentrate cell centrifugation operation theatre . The BMAC mixed thrombin fibrinogen form gel coat area cartilage defect . After discharge hospital , patient advise partial weight bearing operate leg 6 week surgery . They also undergo 5 session physiotherapy . Surgical clip suture remove 2 week follow surgery .</detailed_description>
