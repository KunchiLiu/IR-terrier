	<detailed_description>The trial parallel , cluster-randomized , unblinded , trial primary care , 1:1 allocation ratio . This study assess effect educational outreach visit physician compliance prescription guideline . The general study hypothesis whether educational outreach visit superior usual implementation guideline regard reduction inappropriate prescribing ( compliance prescription guideline ) . All National Health Service primary care unit Lisbon ( Portugal ) region invite participate . Units eligible use Electronic Health Record issue prescription least four doctor willing participate . Doctors intervention unit receive three educational outreach visit ( one guideline ) six month period , control group doctor offer unrelated group training session ( use international classification primary care ) . Intervention visit one one 15 minute discussion conduct guideline author train family physician physician 's workplace . There two primary outcome , measure physician 's level . One proportion COX-2 inhibitor prescribe within entire NSAID class , define daily dos 18 month intervention . The proportion omeprazole within entire proton pump inhibitor class , define daily dos 18 month post-intervention.Besides primary endpoint , secondary outcome short ( 1 month ) medium-term ( 6 month ) effect educational outreach visit prescription two drug class . Other secondary endpoint short , medium long-term effect educational outreach visit prescription clopidogrel . Finally , trial determine cost effectiveness educational outreach visit . Allocation intervention blinding : Clusters enrol allocate sequentially . To achieve good balance regard baseline characteristic , allocation sequence determine minimization ( Ivers NI 2012 ) . The unit minimize number doctor ( 4 5 , 6 7 , 8 to12 ) , median baseline prescription COX-2 inhibitor ( regional median ) , median baseline prescription omeprazole ( regional median ) , proportion doctor le 10 year practice complete vocational training ( 50 % ) , type primary care unit ( family health unit personalize care unit ) . All doctor send consent statement cluster allocation include study . The sequence intervention visit unit determine simple randomization . Allocation concealment ensure following procedure : trial manager ( hire part author research team ) assign sequential number unit participation form receive ; anonymized data participate unit send trial statistician ( sequential number minimization variable ) ; data send two batch , one half unit ; statistician allocate unit trial arm use minimization ; sequence visit determine use random sequence generator Random.org ( http : //www.random.org/sequences/ ) ; statistician return allocation information trial manager . Due nature intervention , neither family physician , detailers blind . Outcomes routinely collect regional health administration independently researcher trial send researcher intervention end . Data analyst ( trial statistician plus one member research team ) blind group visit sequence allocation analysis complete . Intervention comparison : Doctors unit randomize intervention three educational outreach visit six month period . These visit promote implementation governmental guideline prescription follow agent : non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) COX-2 inhibitor , acid secretion modifier , antiplatelets . The outcomes trial chosen accord main key-message guideline . For NSAIDs , COX-2 inhibitor prescribe patient increase gastrointestinal risk tolerate classical NSAID associate gastroprotective agent ; acid secretion modifier , proton pump inhibitor equivalent effectiveness omeprazole use patient least expensive ; antiplatelets , benefit maintaining long term clopidogrel myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome percutaneous coronary intervention . Intervention group : During 15 20 minute visit academic detailer promote one guideline family doctor ( three physician may present visit wish , one one visit prefer encourage ) . The detailer also distribute point care summary highlighting main message . Control group : Usual guideline implementation consist passive dissemination publication National Health Directorate 's website . Doctors unit randomize control group offer unrelated training session ( cod International Classification Primary Care , second edition ) token good participate trial . Cost analysis : Global prescription spending define sum cost drug prescription NSAIDs ( ATC M01A ) , acid suppressive therapy ( proton pump inhibitor ATC A02BC alternative : H2-receptor antagonist ATC A02BA , antacids ATC A02A , misoprostol ATC A02BB01 , sucralfate ATC A02BX02 ) , antiplatelets ( ATC B01AC ) , 18 month intervention . These cost compare amount spent training detailers , prepare print educational material , travel expense intervention unit , payment detailers , program coordination , physician time spend detailer rather patient . Costs analyze point view educational outreach program rather conduct research . Therefore research relate cost ( researcher time data collection analysis ) consider . Similarly , unrelated training session offer control unit account intend improve recruitment would necessary implementation educational outreach program . Data collection : Researchers access prescription data data monitoring system operate Regional Health Administration . Data collect provided employee Administration accord researcher define specification . Importantly , researcher directly involve data collection . This information arrive two month delay date prescription dispense . The prescription information contain either acute condition - single prescription two package dispense within 30 day ; chronic usage - three identical prescription ( two package ) dispense within 6 month . Within drug class study , NSAIDs prescribe chronic usage . Adverse event collect study prescription data available . Detailers record whether plan visit effectively accomplish , whether plan duration , number physician ( include resident ) present , whether visit make patient visit time hour , number time detailer previously visit physician , feedback physician educational material . Sample size : The research team obtain pilot data physician three primary care unit . This data use estimate within unit variability intra-cluster correlation coefficient ( ICC ) . Data also gather unit Regional Health Administration estimate mean prescription standard deviation primary outcome . The mean proportion omeprazole dispense 54.0 % PPIs ( standard deviation , SD , 10.1 % ) ICC 0.027 . The mean proportion COX-2 inhibitor dispense 20.6 % oral NSAIDs ( SD 7.4 % ) ICC 0.249 . The Cochrane review educational outreach visit find median adjust risk difference improvement compliance desire practice 5.6 % ( interquartile range 3.0 % 9.0 % ) previous trial ( O ' Brien , 2008 ) . Therefore , choose calculate sample size assume intervention would lead 5 % absolute difference intervention control unit . If one assume mean cluster size 6 doctor per unit , 1:1 allocation ratio control per intervention unit , alpha type error 0.025 , dropout rate 15 % , sample 110 doctor group allow 80 % power demonstrate 5 % absolute increase proportion omeprazole 5 % absolute decrease COX-2 inhibitor . To recruit necessary number physician 38 primary care unit require . STATA 12.0 ( STATA Corp , TX , USA ) sampsi sampclus command use calculate sample size . Statistical method : Physicians analyze accord randomly allocate group regardless adherence intervention ( intention treat analysis ) . If physician transfer another unit within health region still able monitor prescription . If transfer different health region ( i.e . Lisbon one ) contact physician ask miss prescription data . In case , prescription clopidogrel adjust new patient list . If physician retires unable retrieve data physician move different region use last work month 's prescription . Both group compare primary outcome use generalized mixed-effects model . The ratio COX-2 inhibitor entire NSAIDs class ratio omeprazole entire proton pump inhibitor class respective 95 % confidence interval calculate . Statistical significance assume p-value less 0.025 . STATA 12.0 ( STATA Corp , TX , USA ) use conduct analysis .</detailed_description>
