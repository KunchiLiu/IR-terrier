	<brief_title>Usability Study Assess Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Reveal LINQ Usability Study prospective , non-blinded , non-randomized , multi-center clinical trial . Subjects transmit device data via manual interrogation weekly basis first month evaluate office 1-month post-implant , addition automatic nightly wireless data transmission use MyCareLink® home monitor . All subject request wear external Holter 48 hour approximately 4 week post-insertion . Follow-up visit continue 6 12 month post-implant , monthly manual interrogation . Subjects exit 12 month follow-up visit . The overall study conduct 2 phase differ primarily inclusion criterion : Phase I subject ( initial 30 subject ) indication ICM , Phase II subject ( subject follow initial 30 subject ) atrial fibrillation ( AF ) pre-ablation patient . The study assess functionality Reveal LINQ device assess sense performance data transmission .</detailed_description>
