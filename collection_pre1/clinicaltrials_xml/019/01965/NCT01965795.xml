	<detailed_description>Participants ( n=23 ; 20 complete usable data ) come UCLA 1 in-person screen visit 4 weekly study visit , culminate total 5 study visit . Those meet eligibility criterion take part baseline test session ( randomization ) collect cognitive behavioral data well baseline plasma BDNF level . There also two test session 14 28 day treatment collect data effect active placebo treatment . The questionnaire , cognitive task , diagnostic interview conduct outpatient basis Semel Institute Neuroscience Human Behavior , medical procedure take place UCLA Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) . In-person screening procedure : First , investigator thoroughly explain study obtain informed consent interested participant . Immediately consent obtain , follow questionnaires/ diagnostic interview complete : - Study Admission &amp; Intake Form- This questionnaire administer intake collect demographic information ( i.e . ethnicity , education , employment ) , general mental health history , well substance abuse history . This questionnaire take approximately 15-45 min complete . - Psychiatric evaluation use SCID-IR-TR . The SCID administer intake screen determine whether participant meet DSM-IV-TR criterion drug dependence rule major psychiatric disorder ( e.g. , affective disorder , schizophrenia ; Spitzer et al. , 1995 ) . - The International Physical Activity Questionnaires ( IPAQ ) . The purpose IPAQ ( Craig et al. , 2003 ) record exercise participant engage may impact finding . It take approximately 5 min complete . Urine testing ( 40 ml ) do test pregnancy ( female ) drug abuse . Urine test do screen well study visit . Once urine analyze , disposed sanitary manner . Medical Procedures complete in-person screening : Participants give blood sample take Rapid Plasma Reagin ( RPR ) , Hepatitis B C test [ 25-ml sample include complete chemistry panel ( 5 ml ) , hepatic panel ( 3 ml ) , Hepatitis B C , RPR test ( 7 ml ) , plasma BDNF ( 0.1 ml ) ] . The study physician inform participant implication status RPR , hepatitis B hepatitis C test result positive , refer participant information . Study staff inform participant negative RPR , hepatitis B hepatitis C test result health status . Height weight assess , body mass index ( BMI ) value provide inclusion criterion ( 18 ≤ BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 ) . In addition , vital sign heart-rate ( ECG ) , pulse , blood pressure measure . Plasma BDNF ( biomarkers ) measure blood sample ( finger stick ) obtain prior , weekly visit UCLA initiate WCFC placebo administration . The maximum time period allowable screen visit attendance UCLA CTRC 4 week . If time elapses , potential subject screen . Study Visit Timeline : Day Up -28 : Telephone screen Day 0- In-person medical screening , baseline cognitive testing session rating subjective mood state . BDNF assay . Randomization group , initiation WCFC/placebo treatment , 14-day supply provide participant . Day 7- Collection compliance questionnaire , BDNF assay . Day 14- Cognitive testing rating subjective mood state . Collection compliance questionnaire ; re-supply WCFC/placebo ; phlebotomy blood chemistry assay BDNF biomarkers . Day 21- Collection compliance questionnaire , BDNF assay . Day 28- Completion WCFC/placebo treatment . Final cognitive testing session rating subjective mood state . Collection compliance questionnaire . Phlebotomy blood chemistry , assay BDNF biomarkers . Study Visit Procedures ( ~2-3 hr ) : Participants meet inclusion criterion randomize receive either WCFC placebo . During active treatment time ( 28 day ) , visit UCLA Semel Institute weekly basis . On day 0 ( baseline ) day 14 , WCFC placebo provide , amount sufficient 2-week supply , self-administer respective treatment . At weekly visit , questionnaire regard compliance complete , blood sample take assay BDNF . A cognitive test battery mood-rating scale complete baseline 14 28 day treatment . At midpoint assessment ( 14 day ) completion treatment ( 28 day ) blood draw assay blood chemistry panel ( baseline ) well biomarkers addition BDNF . Nutraceutical Administration Dose Justification : WCFC ( NeurofactorTM ) : A dose 100 mg administer twice daily ( breakfast dinner ) . The dose chosen basis publish work Applied Bioclinical , Inc. ( Reyes-Izquierdo et al. , 2013 ; Pietrzkowski et al. , press ) . Specifically , Reyes-Izquierdo colleague ( 2013 ) report 100 mg WCFC result increase plasma BDNF 143 % baseline ( n=10 , healthy adult age 18 55 year old ) . More recently Pietrzkowski co-worker ( unpublished manuscript press ) observe 90 % increase plasma BDNF first 60 minute single 100 mg dose WCFC . The effect sustain 2-3 hour . Therefore , test always take place morning within 2 hour WCFC ingestion breakfast . As quality control measure , WCFC batch test delineate chemical profile polyphenols make sure one batch use , chemical profile identical batch . Placebo : The placebo Nutrim® , supply Abclinical administer twice daily , identical WCFC treatment ( participant group ) . Both WCFC placebo powder form , capsulate size 1 gelatin capsule , white blue , distribute brown plastic bottle ( 28 caps/bottle : enough 14 day treatment ) . The first bottle provide time randomization , second bottle provide day 14 dosing day 15-28 . The bottle label ABC logo treatment code ABC # 7UCLA01 ABC # 7UCLA12 . The following questionnaire assess mood administer study session : - HAM-D- The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale multiple item questionnaire use provide indication depression , guide evaluate recovery . The questionnaire design adult use rate severity depression probe mood , feeling guilt , suicide ideation , insomnia , agitation retardation , anxiety , weight loss , somatic symptom . Assessment time estimate 20 minute . The HAM-D use previously , show correlation increase plasma BDNF improve ( decrease ) HAM-D score ( e.g. , Shimizu et al. , 2003 , Gonul et al. , 2005 , Aydemir et al. , 2005 , Yoshimura et al. , 2007 ) . - PANAS- The Positive Negative Affect Schedule ( Watson et al. , 1988 ) 20-item questionnaire comprises two mood scale , one measuring positive affect measure negative affect . Each item rat 5-point scale range 1 = slightly 5 = extremely indicate extent respondent felt way indicated time frame . The participant instruct provide rating affective state time assessment . - Adverse Events Log- At visit randomization , adverse event occur record , evaluate term frequency severity ( mild , moderate , severe ) use form . The following cognitive test administer study session : - Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised ( HVLT-R ) : This task assessment verbal memory . - Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ) : This computer task assessment attention &amp; inhibition . - Spatial Sternberg : This computer task assessment spatial short term memory . - Letter Number Sequencing : This task assessment work memory . - Attention Networks Task : This computer task assessment attention &amp; inhibition . - Verbal fluency : This task assessment executive function . - Finger Tapping : This task assessment psychomotor speed . These test assess multiple cognitive domain , total battery test take approximately 1.5 hour complete . Thus , burden participant low . Participants train task baseline measurement take reduce effect learn performance . Biochemical Measures : The biochemical measurement perform study determination plasma BDNF baseline ( conduct medical screening procedure ) weekly visit follow initiation WCFC placebo administration , assay biomarkers serum 14- 28-day test point . Determination plasma BDNF must perform time day subject time-points , due diurnal variation plasma BDNF level ( Piccini et al. , 2008 ) . Weekly BDNF data use index compliance WCFC administration . Data baseline , 14 day 28 day use test association behavioral measure .</detailed_description>
