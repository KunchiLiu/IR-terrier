	<brief_summary>Multiple myeloma cell dependent calcium ( Ca2+ ) function . Specifically , Ca2+ require function endoplasmic reticulum protein , include immunoglobulin , fold prior release cell . Multiple myeloma cell secrete large concentration immunoglobulins continuously result depend mitochondrion activity replenish Ca2+ level endoplasmic reticulum show vitro lab . Fenofibrate show inhibit mitochondrial function result inhibition protein fold endoplasmic reticulum MM cell lead induction stress signal know unfolded protein response subsequently apoptosis . The effective anti-myeloma concentration fenofibrate attainable clinical setting range effective concentration anti-hyperlipidemic effect . The investigator propose evaluate fenofibrate therapy multiple myeloma patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm multiple myeloma . ( smolder myeloma symptomatic multiple myeloma ) . Patients must measurable disease therefore must least one follow : Serum Mprotein ≥1 gm/dL ( &gt; =10 gm/L ) Urine Mprotein ≥200 mg/24 hr Serum FLC assay : involve FLC &gt; =10 mg/dL ( &gt; = 100 mg/L ) provide serum FLC ratio abnormal . Male female &gt; = 18 year age . Life expectancy &gt; = 6 month . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 . Normal organ marrow function define : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,000/mm3 Platelets &gt; = 75,000/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; = 8 g/dL Calculated serum creatinine ( calculate CockroftGault method ) &gt; = 30 mL/min AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) = &lt; 2.5 X ULN Total bilirubin = &lt; 1.5 X ULN Patient must least 2 week prior chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biological therapy , immunotherapy , major surgery investigational anticancer therapy prior first dose study drug . Patient recover toxicity ( &lt; Grade 2 ) and/or complication prior therapy . Patient able swallow capsule able take tolerate oral medication continuous basis . Female patient childbearing potential must willing use 2 adequate barrier method contraception prevent pregnancy agree abstain heterosexual intercourse least 1 month dosing , woman study 12 week last dose study drug . Adequate contraceptive method include intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , cervical cap spermicide , female condom spermicide . Spermicides alone acceptable method contraception . Male patient agree female partner childbearing potential use 2 adequate barrier method contraception describe Section 3.1.10 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior first dose study drug . Patient available periodic blood sampling , study relate assessment management treat institution duration study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients present isolated plasmacytoma Inability swallow oral medication . Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant ( subject prior autologous transplant eligible ) . Patient plan undergo type stem cell transplantation ( allogeneic autologous ) within 4 week initiation study therapy . Concurrent therapy HMGCoA Reductase Inhibitors . Patient gallbladder disease cholelithiasis . Patient active liver disease , include biliary cirrhosis unexplained liver function abnormality . Patients receive renal dialysis . History hypersensitivity fenofibrate fenofibric acid , include sever skin rash ( e.g. , StevensJohnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis ) Patients would receive investigational agent study . Participation investigational drug study within 4 week precede start study treatment . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patient systemic infection require treatment . Patient acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease pericardial disease . Subject receive corticosteroid therapy ( &gt; 10 mg prednisone equivalent ) . Subject regular user recent history ( within last year ) illicit drug , substance abuse . Subject pregnant breast feeding , expect conceive father child within project duration study . Subject known HIV positive . Subject clinically active Hepatitis B C History prior malignancy except cervical carcinoma situ , nonmelanoma skin cancer , adequately treat localized prostate cancer PSA &lt; 0.1 , undergone potentially curative therapy evidence disease five year , deem low risk recurrence his/her treat physician . Patient CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . History gastrointestinal disease could potentially impact ability patient swallow and/or absorb study drug ( i.e. , gastrointestinal surgery , malabsorption syndrome , subject require use feed tube ) History gastrointestinal surgery procedure might opinion investigator interfere swallow and/or absorption study drug .</criteria>
