	<brief_summary>The Investigators hope learn prevent lessen symptom neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) baby bear narcotic-dependent mother use drug ondansetron mother prior delivery baby delivery . The study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study one half mother-baby pair receive ondansetron half mother-baby pair receive placebo . The pregnant narcotic-dependent mother receive intravenous dose study medication prior delivery ; neonate , birth , receive study medication mother receive every 24 hour 5 day .

	<detailed_description>All neonate screen 12-lead EKG prior first dose study medication determine QTc prolongation present . A repeat 12-lead EKG do dose study medication , approximately 2-5 hour post dose ; neonate prolong QTc study drug stop . Investigators may obtain 9 pharmacokinetic ( PK ) blood sample neonates 5 day standard care blood sample draw . These sample consist 1 2 drop blood collect filter paper send Stanford PK analysis . The modified Finnegan score system use evaluate neonate symptom NAS site consider standard-of-care baby risk NAS . Morphine first treatment choice treatment medication choice ( opioid non-opioid ) NAS symptom . Each site involve establish guideline start , advance wean treatment NAS . Any medication use treat NAS record . Interim analysis : perform first 20 pregnant woman neonate enrol dosed study drug . ( Interim Analysis do first 21 mother/baby pair May 2016 ) . To protect confidentiality patient ( study subject ) , lead site , Stanford University , receive Certificate Confidentiality NIH .</detailed_description>
