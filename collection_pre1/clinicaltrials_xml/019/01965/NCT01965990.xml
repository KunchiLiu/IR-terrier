	<brief_summary>Body weight excess , overweight overt obesity , associate adverse health outcome . In view time-trends obesity epidemic related cost burden , search effective strategy weight reduction long-term maintenance weight loss ( WL ) top agenda public health system . The current first-line strategy include several treatment option dietary intervention implement together exercise program . Unfortunately , compliance intervention long-term difficult . It infrequent observe people follow one diet another experience multiple failure , turn , lead high body weight adverse consequence body composition fat distribution . The high number attempt , difficult adherence intervention . In presence severe ( body mass index &gt; 40 kg/m2 ) complicate obesity , bariatric surgery could propose . This therapeutic option effective , devoid complication may irreversible . Obesity-related complication , diabetes , hypertension sleep apnoea likely occur frequently increase body mass index ( BMI ) rapid considerable WL mandatory curtail risk . In scenario , alternative treatment option warrant . About 40 year ago , introduction protein-sparing modify fasting ( PSMF ) achieve use oral high-protein food liquid formula diet Blackburn Bistrian , several study evaluate effectiveness safety . They show responsible supervised very-low calorie diet ( VLCDs ) could consider safe appropriate therapy obesity . The purpose present study investigate potential role 2-week course enteral treatment low-calorie protein-based formula management severe obesity . The rationale treatment option rest follow consideration : 1 ) VLCDs appear able reduce cardiovascular risk rapidly effectively ; 2 ) VLCDs induce considerable short long-term WL ; 3 ) optimal compliance intervention , active participation patient require ; 4 ) continuous administration intervention formula enteral route enables maintenance body amino acid pool . Before proposed clinical use , new WL program scientifically evaluate . Accordingly , present study , attention focus efficacy term improve cardiometabolic risk profile , also feasibility safety procedure .</brief_summary>
