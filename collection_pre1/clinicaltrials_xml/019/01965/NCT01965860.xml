	<brief_summary>The main goal design comprehensive endovascular simulation curriculum consist cognitive psychomotor skill train endovascular management symptomatic vascular disease low limb ( Rutherford classification 2-5 ; stenosis occlusion iliac , superficial femoral popliteal artery ) . The curriculum consist E-learning , video-based learn simulation exercise Virtual Reality simulator endovascular procedure simulate . Skills transferability real life practice verify mean RCT . In RCT investigator compare cognitive knowledge technical performance curricular train surgical trainee conventionally trained trainee treatment patient supervision . The hypothesis state surgeon train within PROSPECT curriculum show improve technical knowledge endovascular treatment atherosclerotic disease iliac , superficial femoral popliteal artery demonstrate increase technical proficiency angiosuite comparison surgeon receive conventional training . Subjects surgical trainee ( N=60 ) . They randomize control group ( N=30 ) PROSPECT group ( N=30 ) . Both group continue traditional clinical education PROSPECT group additionally train within endovascular curriculum . The investigator hope study may ultimately lead improvement quality patient care standardize competency endovascular operator train practice . Additionally cost-effectiveness analysis PROSPECT compare traditional training modality execute . A successful training program expect lead shorten learn curve , reduction number error real life procedure efficient use hybrid angio suite . The financial impact potentially short duration endovascular intervention study compare time investment additional cost associate stepwise , supervise training use VR simulator .</brief_summary>
