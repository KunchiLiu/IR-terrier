	<detailed_description>Intrahepatic cholestasis pregnancy ( ICP ) unique disease liver result abnormal bile acid level liver function . In literature , incidence ICP range 0.1 - 15.6 % . [ 1 ] Women diagnose ICP often present itch , may severe . More concerning , however , impact ICP adverse fetal pregnancy outcome , include preterm delivery , meconium exposure , fetal demise , increase neonatal respiratory complication . The risk fetal demise estimate 1-3 % . The mechanism fetal demise ICP unknown , therefore reliably predict . There evidence suggest extremely elevate bile acid level associate bad fetal outcome , particularly level great 40 μmol/L . [ 3 ] Ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) improve impaired hepatocellular secretion stimulate canalicular bile acid transporter protein expression , widely use first-line treatment symptomatic relief patient ICP . [ 1 ] Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) two omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid find fish . DHA known play key role early fetal brain development , associate modest beneficial effect neurodevelopmental cognitive outcome child . [ 2 ] In neonate parental nutrition-induced cholestasis ( PN-cholestasis ) , parental fish oil show hepatoprotective treatment PN-cholestasis , prevention cholestasis premature infant risk disease . [ 3-5 ] The incidence ICP single hospital center Queens , NY estimate 5 % secondary high concentration patient high-risk ethnic group . High risk patient bile acid level great equal 40 μmol/L manage aggressively inpatient admission continuous fetal monitoring , treatment UDCA , serial total bile acid level weekly , routinely offer early delivery document fetal lung maturity 36 37 week gestation , sign fetal distress . This study prospective randomize trial woman diagnose ICP prior 36 week admit Elmhurst Hospital inpatient observation . Women randomize receive standard prenatal vitamin daily prenatal vitamin plus fish oil supplementation addition standard UDCA 300mg mouth three time daily . Dietary fish intake subject record . Total bile acid serum level follow weekly , fetal monitor daily non-stress test perform woman per standard care ICP Elmhurst hospital . The primary outcome interest 20 % reduction serum total bile acid level treatment group compare control group time point . Secondary outcomes interest include change maternal symptom measure use validate itch score , change UDCA dosing , length hospital stay , neonatal outcome include gestational age delivery , Apgar score , neonatal intensive care unit admission , neonatal length stay , meconium aspiration , birth weight , perinatal mortality . Assuming 80 % statistical power significance level 0.05 detect 20 % reduction serum total bile acid treatment group compare placebo group , total 100 patient arm need .</detailed_description>
