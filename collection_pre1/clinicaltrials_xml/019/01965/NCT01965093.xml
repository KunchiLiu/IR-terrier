	<brief_summary>The serious peri-operative respiratory event ( PRE ) pediatric anesthesia desaturation hypoxemia could lead cardiovascular collapse cardiac arrest . Intermittent hypoxic episode especially infant also associate impaired growth , longer-term cardiorespiratory instability poor neurodevelopmental outcome.12 The mechanism peri-operative desaturation occur normoxia infant brain quite similar overabundance oxygen acutely hypoxic infant use 100 % oxygen hyperoxia resuscitation acutely asphyxiate infant generate excessive neurotoxic compound increase oxidative stress markers.17 Anesthetic agent involve gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) receptor eg ; volatile agent , midazolam N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDA ) receptor eg ; nitrous oxide , ketamine cause neuronal apoptosis , neuronal necrosis , neuronal cell death memory deficit rat pup . Moreover , prolong anesthetic exposure , irrespective open heart surgery , influence neurodevelopment brain rodents.17 However , evidence anesthetic agent cause apoptosis neurodegeneration human neonatal brain still clear . Thus , peri-operative desaturation occur young age regardless severity combine general anesthesia might possibly affect long-term impact regard growth neurodevelopmental outcome infant intelligence outcome old child . In study , interested look intelligence outcome , part neurodevelopment outcome , preschool child age ≤ 5 year developed desaturation peri-operatively . Because include wide range age newborn five year old test neurodevelopment outcome old child , intelligence outcome may appropriate applied infant young age . Therefore , objective study compare intelligence outcome child develop peri-operative desaturation child develop PRE .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Material method A historical concurrent follow study conduct Songklanagarind Hospital , 853-bed tertiary care hospital southern Thailand , approval Ethics Committee , Prince Songkla University November 15th , 2012 . Written inform consent sign parent participate study . Participants Children age ≤ 5 year old receive general anesthesia ( GA ) develop intraoperative post-anesthetic care unit ( PACU ) desaturation include study define desaturation group . The exclusion criterion ASA ( American Society Anesthesiologist ) classification 4 5 , preoperative oxygen saturation &lt; 95 % room air , require preoperative endotracheal tube intubation ( ETT ) mechanical ventilation , congenital heart disease open heart surgery , neurosurgery , preoperative delayed development , perinatal hypoxia fetal growth retardation . Perioperative desaturation define oxygen saturation &lt; 95 % 10 second [ 9 ] . Children desaturation group match child non-desaturation group one per one sex , age within year general anesthesia , type surgery technique anesthesia . Non-desaturation group define child develop perioperative respiratory event eg ; desaturation , laryngospasm , bronchospasm , upper airway obstruction reintubation . After child desaturation group identify , one child non-desaturation group randomly select list 3 4 child match demographic , surgery anesthesia profile . The parent group contact investigator phone call invitation postcard . If select child non-desaturation group decline parent could reach , next child list would randomly select . Outcome interest The outcomes interest divide growth developmental outcome intelligence outcome . The intelligence outcome growth developmental outcome evaluate least 6 month expose general anesthesia . Children age least 2 year 9 year equally compare outcomes interest desaturation non-desaturation group . For growth development outcome , preoperative body weight , percentile weight , height percentile height compare current body weight , current height , percentile weight percentile height . Month age first mean word month age first walk ask . The main outcome intelligence score intelligence quotient ( IQ ) score . There two intelligence test available Songklanagarind hospital suitable test intelligence outcome study ; Standford Binet form L-M Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children , 3rd edition ( WISC-III ) . The aged child desaturation non-desaturation group appoint IQ test study period . A child psychologist ( T.D . ) perform IQ test child . The Standford Binet form L-M main intelligence test use study . It measure cognitive ability regard verbal reasoning , quantitative reasoning , abstract visual reason short-term memory skill wide range IQ score vary 20 140 . The suitable age use Standford Binet form L-M 2 7 year old . The WISC-III test use supplemental test child reach ceiling age 7 year still could complete IQ measurement . The WISC-III consist 2 main subtests eg ; verbal subtests performance subtests ( nonverbal subtest ) average IQ score use compare 2 group . The IQ score IQ test consider similar level intelligence outcome study . The type IQ test record compare 2 group . The potential predictor variables The child family relate predictor anesthesia related predictor include data record . The child family relate predictor history prematurity , history parental smoking , religion , mother age delivery , mother occupation , father occupation , monthly family income , mother education , father education , child education , train parent ( , partial regular ) child capability ( full help , partial help help ) . Definition train parent Training parent define developmental stimulation training parent caregiver include follow statement eg ; ( 1 ) teach thing compatible age , regularly day week consider regular stimulation training , sometimes consider partial stimulation training . ( 2 ) ask simple question stimulate mind , regularly day week consider regular stimulation training , sometimes consider partial stimulation training . ( 3 ) Taking outside ride playground stimulate show thing , people , animal ask question , regularly day week take outside stimulating mind consider regular stimulation training , sometimes consider partial stimulation training , take outside stimulate mind consider partial stimulation training . ( 4 ) Buying stimulation toy play , buy toy play regularly day week consider regular stimulation training , buy toy play consider partial stimulation train none 4 item perform consider stimulation training . Training parent classify 3 category training , partial training regular training . Definition child capability Children capability define capability child able thing compatible age . For 2 3 year age , child climb stair stair , climb cot take cloth . For 3 5 year age , child eat spoon , take shower , brush teeth ride 3 wheel bike . For 5 6 year age , child get dress button , go toilet wear shoe without shoelace . For 6 8 year age , child draw write paper , get dress button tie shoelace . Children capability classify 3 category full help , partial help help . Anesthesia related predictor ASA classification , time repeat GA , type surgery , choice GA , technique GA , induction agent , intubation agent , inhalation agent , gas mixed oxygen , narcotic duration anesthesia . Statistical analysis Analysis perform R program version 2.14.1 . Descriptive statistic compute variable include frequency , proportion , mean + standard deviation ( SD ) median ( interquartile range ; IQR ) . Predictor variables continuous categorical data either originally categorical data , categorize selection suitable cut point . The growth developmental outcome eg ; current body weight , current height , percentile weight percentile height include continuous data age index GA , current age , weight height index GA , percentile weight height index , mother age delivery , monthly family income , first mean word , first walk , time repeat GA , duration anesthesia analyze Student 's t- test non- parametric rank sum test appropriate . Categorical data consist child family profile eg ; gender , history prematurity , history parental smoking , religion , mother occupation , father occupation , mother education , father education , child education , train parent , child capability ; anesthesia profile eg ; ASA ( American Society Anesthesiologist ) classification , type surgery , choice GA , technique GA , induction agent , intubation agent , inhalation agent , gas mixed oxygen narcotic compare use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test appropriate . The IQ score compare desaturation non-desaturation group use simple linear regression model . The explanatory variable may relate IQ score , percentile weight percentile height analyze use multiple linear regression model show evidence differ across outcome category univariate analysis ( p ≤ 0.2 ) . The magnitude precision association indicate adjusted coefficient 95 % confidence interval . In multivariate modeling technique , association outcome consider significant likelihood ratio p-values ≤ 0.05 . Sample size calculation The sample size calculation base comparison IQ score desaturation group non-desaturation group receive general anesthesia . According National Thai Survey 72,780 school child 76 province 2007-2008 use Standard Progressive Matrices ( SPM parallel version ; updated 2003 ) 45 , average IQ score Thai child 98.59 whereas average IQ score southern Thai child bit low ( 96.85 ) . We assume 5 point difference IQ score would impact intelligence outcome school child ( age &lt; 9 year old ) . Therefore , sample size test hypothesis difference 2 mean base mean difference IQ score 5 standard deviation 12 would 91 child per group power 80 % type I error 5 % 102 child per group would require compensate 10 % drop data collection .</detailed_description>
