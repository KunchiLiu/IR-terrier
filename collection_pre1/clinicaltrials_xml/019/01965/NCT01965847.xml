	<detailed_description>Background Hypertension major risk factor cardiovascular renal disease , lead cause premature mortality worldwide . Early hypertension study show treat elevate blood pressure ( BP ) reduce patient ' risk cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality . In subsequent research , patient achieve great improvement cardiovascular outcome treatment aim moderate systolic BP target ( &lt; 150mmHg ) high target . Although observational data suggest even low BP target may beneficial , see randomized trial ; instead , `` intense '' treatment hypertension ( i.e. , target systolic BP &lt; 120mmHg ) find effect participant ' risk renal disease , cardiovascular disease , all-cause mortality . Similarly negative finding report study enrol participant chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) diabetes ; fail demonstrate benefit intensive lower clinic BP . One potential explanation apparent lack benefit intense BP target study protocol target reduction clinic BP rather ambulatory BP . Ambulatory BP monitoring ( ABPM ) allow assessment BP throughout day night . Of BP measurement , nighttime systolic BP appear best predictor cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality . In fact , observational study , clinic BP longer predictor adverse event adjust nighttime BP . Importantly , elevate nighttime BP modifiable risk factor ; even dose antihypertensive medication low nighttime BP reduces proteinuria . In large , randomize control trial , even dose antihypertensive medication reduce hazard rate major cardiovascular event 67 % . Findings similar subgroup participant CKD . However , single-center study design evaluate cardiovascular outcome , progression CKD . The long-term effect nighttime dose antihypertensive medication progression CKD unknown . To address important gap knowledge , investigator plan conduct pragmatic , randomize control trial . 3600 participant risk progression CKD take ≥1 antihypertensive medication daily randomize morning versus even dose least one antihypertensive medication . The purpose propose study obtain pilot data demonstrate feasibility trial efficacy intervention . Overview Trial Design The study conduct renal clinic University Minnesota Medical Center ( UMMC ) . Eligible patient chronic kidney disease take daily antihypertensive medication . Participants randomize receive daily antihypertensive medication morning evening . Medication therapy management focus antihypertensive medication take place time clinic visit via phone clinic visit . Adherence medication assess 3-6 week clinic visit . Objective The primary objective pilot study demonstrate 1 ) feasibility simple randomized trial 2 ) efficacy medication therapy management assign participant take daily antihypertensive medication either morning evening .</detailed_description>
