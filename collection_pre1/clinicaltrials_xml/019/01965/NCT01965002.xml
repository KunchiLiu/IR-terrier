	<brief_title>Feasibility ExAblate MRI Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Tx Soft Tissue Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives include assessment incidence severity adverse event associate treatment , accuracy ablation compare measure volume treat base MR thermometry post-contrast non-perfused tissue calculation actual treat volume resect tumor . In addition , tissue adjacent treat region within tumor outside gross limit ablation examine histologically evidence thermal damage .</detailed_description>
