	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) neurodegenerative disorder characterize progressive loss memory cognitive function . It common cause dementia old adult , affect approximately 18 million people worldwide , include almost 500,000 Philadelphia tri-state area . After age 65 , incidence AD rise exponentially , double every five year . By age 85 , almost half u AD . In 2030 , many 7.7 million Americans could AD , 2050 number could rise 11-16 million people . The annual cost AD United States $ 200 billion . AD-related medical complication among common cause death elderly population . Despite alarm statistic , `` cure '' AD may essential since delay onset AD 5 year could profound impact disorder reduce incidence cost AD 50 % 2050 . AD difficult recognize early stage , principal complaint typically increase episode forgetfulness . This stage commonly refer mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . Neuroimaging CSF biomarkers demonstrate good accuracy predict MCI patient later `` convert '' AD tend remain stable revert normal cognition . The diagnosis AD make increased loss memory cognitive ability ( eg , language , praxis , executive function ) affect daily functioning . As symptoms dementia inevitably worsen , patient may become incapable even basic activity feed dressing . The disease course often span decade , create vast social financial burden society extract immeasurable emotional toll family member . Clinical preclinical evidence accumulate brain insulin resistance may play role pathogenesis and/or progression Alzheimer 's disease ameliorate insulin action brain may benefit cognition symptomatically modify disease pathology .</brief_summary>
