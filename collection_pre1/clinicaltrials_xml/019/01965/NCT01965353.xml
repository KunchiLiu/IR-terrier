	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate investigational drug call `` panobinostat '' ( LBH589 ) combination standard agent lenalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone possible treatment multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Of Panobinostat/Lenalidomide/Bortezomib/Dex Relapsed And Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In research study , participant give study drug-dosing diary treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 21 day ( 3 week ) . The diary also include special instruction take study drug ( ) . The investigator look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant multiple myeloma , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose participant get depend number participant enrol study participant well tolerated dos . Each treatment cycle 21 day long . The participant come clinic day 1 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 10 11 Cycle 1 day 1 , 4 , 8 11 Cycles 2 beyond . Days 1 5 Cycle 1 take 8 hour . Every visit take 1-4 hour , however always possibility could take long . Study Drugs : - Panobinostat capsule participant take three time week first two week cycle . Then participant one week study medication . - Bortezomib administer clinic subcutaneous injection twice week first two week 21 day cycle . - Lenalidomide take orally daily day 1-14 cycle . - Dexamethasone take orally day bortezomib administration Cycles 1-8 , day 1 , 8 15 Cycles 9 beyond . Planned Follow-up : The investigator would like monitor participant 's medical condition even participant longer participate study . The investigator would like call participant telephone every 6 month see participant . Keeping touch participant check condition help investigator look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion screen examination . All laboratory assessment perform within 21 day initiation protocol therapy unless otherwise specify . Participants must previous diagnosis Multiple Myeloma , accord International Myeloma Foundation 2003 Diagnostic Criteria Patients must relapse relapsed refractory disease receive 2 line therapy . Relapse occurrence follow : 1 ) &gt; 25 % increase Mprotein baseline level ; 2 ) reappearance Mprotein disappear ; 3 ) definite increase size number lytic bone lesion recognize radiograph ( compression fracture per se constitute relapse ) . Subjects consider refractory therapy , define progression treatment within 60 day completion salvage treatment . Subjects primary refractory disease exclude . This include : 1 ) nonresponding , nonprogressing ; 2 ) progressive ; primary refractory , progressive disease patient meet criterion true progressive disease ( Durie 2006 ) . Participants must measurable myeloma , define one following : serum Mprotein ≥ 0.5 g/dl , urine Mprotein ≥ 200 mg/24 h , and/or serum FLC assay : involve FLC level ≥ 10 mg/dl abnormal serum FLC ratio .

Patients benign hyperbilirubinemia ( e.g. , Gilbert 's syndrome ) eligible Other ongoing antimyeloma therapy . Patients may receive concomitant therapy bisphosphonates low dose corticosteroid ( e.g. , prednisone 10 mg p.o . q.d . equivalent ) symptom management comorbid condition .

Concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitor time screen . If use CYP3A4 inhibitor become medically necessary study , must use caution . Antimyeloma therapy , include radiotherapy , within 2 week within 5 halflives agent active metabolite ( whichever longer ) prior Day 1 recover side effect ( ≤ Grade 1 ) therapy .
