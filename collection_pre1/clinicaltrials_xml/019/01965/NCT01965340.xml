	<brief_summary>Sepsis major cause morbidity mortality amongst burn patient . Burn shock respiratory failure use major cause mortality progressively replace sepsis multiple organ failure . It rare treatment failure occur several week , even month injury consequence sepsis usually cause multi-drug resistant ( MDR ) microorganism . Introduction early surgery combine topical systemic antibiotherapy dramatically enhance survival sepsis burn trauma , improvement impair rapid development hard-to-treat MDR bacteria . Correct prescription anti-infective agent could one way curb steadily increase development multidrug resistance . Administration antibiotic burn patient complex : frequently suffer kidney dysfunction , usually experience tremendous shift liquid intra-vascular - inter-cellular intra-cellular compartment , often hypo-albumin protein-emic , finally present profoundly modify metabolism . All aspect make particular population patient high risk prescription . Monitoring drug concentration plasma patient , so-called TDM Therapeutic Drug Monitoring , introduce clinical practice several decade primarily avoid toxicity small number drug narrow therapeutic window . However , increase availability detection technique , number drug measure plasma patient grow tremendously last decade . As consequence , currently possible monitor drug concentration prevent toxicity , also improve efficacy . For instance , several study demonstrate TDM improve antibiotic prescription different population hospitalize patient , include critically ill patient , direct impact outcome . Such study amongst burn patient however lack , although particular population high risk suffer mis-prescription . We thus hypothesize systematic TDM could improve antibiotic prescription peculiar population . To end , propose implement 3-year prospective , randomize , mono-centric , clinical trial analyze impact systematic TDM anti-infective agent prescription amongst burn patient .</brief_summary>
