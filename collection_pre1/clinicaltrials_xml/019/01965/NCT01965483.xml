	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Adjuvant Radiotherapy Breast Cancer Using Once Week Hypofractionated Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient tell study question clarify . After agree participate study must sign declaration free inform consent . All radiation treatment carry Radiotherapy Department Haroldo Juacaba Hospital . The primary intention radiotherapy ( RT ) treat entire breast . Initially , patient supine position make individual immobilization device , do pre-planning conventional radiotherapy simulator . After , CT-scan perform three-dimensional conformal radiation planning . The contour treatment volume ( target volumes organs-at-risk ) dosimetric calculation perform Eclipse treatment planning system ( Varian Medical Systems , Palo Alto-CA , USA ) . The total dose prescribe 30 Gy , 5 fraction 6.0 Gy , 1 fraction per week , 1 week apart weekday . In dosimetric analysis , least 95 % breast target-volume must cover ≥ 95 % prescription dose . The point maximum dose must less 110 % . Clinical evaluation carry weekly treatment course 4th 8th week conclusion RT . The toxicity graduate accord Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , v 3.0 . Breast photographs hold initially 6 12 month treatment . Breast cosmetic appearance evaluate 2 radiation oncologist classify accord Harvard scale . The patient 's self-referred quality-of-life ( QoL ) data collect 3 different moment , beg RT end 1 month conclusion RT . The QoL evaluation tool use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) QLQ-30 breast cancer specific module QLQ-BR23 questionnaire . The projected sample size 40 patient . Which patient right longer part study time , desire . The study interrupt case severe toxicity ( ≥ grade IV ) , death cause treatment and/or local recurrence superior expect , report literature . Interim analyze perform every 6 month well monitor possible outcome .</detailed_description>
