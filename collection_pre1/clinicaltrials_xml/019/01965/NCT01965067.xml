	<brief_summary>The primary efficacy endpoint time start administration sugammadex recovery TOF ratio 0.9 deep neuromuscular block ( 1-2 twitch post-tetanic count ) induce rocuronium mild hypothermia core temperatures 34.5°C 35°C , compare normal thermal condition . Secondary endpoint include time start administration sugammadex recovery TOF ratio 0.7 0.8 group , vital sign [ heart rate blood pressure ] pre-reversal , post-reversal , recovery post-anesthetic visit , incidence residual neuromuscular blockade , post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) adverse event mild hypothermia normal thermal condition . We hypothesize mild hypothermia core temperatures 34.5°C 35°C diminish efficacy sugammadex .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , parallel-group , safety-assessor-blinded phase IV study conduct . The study conduct accordance principle Good Clinical Practice approve appropriate Institutional Review Boards regulatory agency . Written inform consent obtain patient . In total , 60 patient , age 20 65 year , American Society Anesthesiologists physical status I II undergo elective abdominal surgery general anesthesia supine position study . Patients exclude expect difficult airway , know neuromuscular disease , significant hepatic renal dysfunction , family history malignant hyperthermia , know allergy one drug use protocol , intake medication might interact muscle relaxant , pregnant , breast feeding . The anesthetized patient randomly assign 2 group normal thermal condition core temperatures 36.5°C 37°C ( C group ) mild hypothermia core temperature 34.5°C 35°C ( H group ) deep block state ( 1-2 twitch post-tetanic count ) . The randomization perform use computer-generated sealed envelope determine condition ( normal thermal condition mild hypothermia ) patient perform deep block state ( 1-2 twitch post-tetanic count ) . The anesthesiologist remain blinded C group H group deep block state ( 1-2 twitch post-tetanic count ) give throughout remain course anesthesia . No premedication give . After arrival operating room , electrocardiography , non-invasive measurement blood pressure oxygen saturation perform . All patient connect bispectral index ( BIS ) monitor ( Model A 2000 , Aspect Medical Systems , Natick , MA , USA ) . Anesthesia induce remifentanil 0.5 μg/kg/min inject intravenously 120 second ( ) follow propofol 2 - 2.5 mg/kg inject intravenously 30 s. After loss consciousness ventilation via facemask fresh gas flow 4 L/min ( 50 % nitrous oxide oxygen ) control manually maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) 30 35 mmHg . Maintenance anesthesia 1 - 1.5 minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC ) sevoflurane gas mixture 50 % nitrous oxide oxygen maintain BIS 40 50 infusion dos remifentanil 0.05 - 0.2 μg/kg/min throughout surgery . Core body temperature measure thermocouple place distal esophagus ( DeRoyal® , DeRoyal Industries Inc. , Powell , TN , USA ) . Core temperature manipulate core temperature range : 36.5°C 37°C C group 34.5°C 35°C H group surface cool wet towel fan air conditioner . The target temperature , achieve stabilize , maintain within ± 0.1°C throughout remainder study . The peripheral skin temperature wrist maintain 32°C group . Neuromuscular function assess use acceleromyography adductor pollicis muscle ( TOF-Watch SX® , Organon Ltd. , Dublin , Ireland ) . Before place surface electrode , skin overlie ulnar nerve dominant hand cleanse isopropyl alcohol . Two electrode ( CleartrodeTM , Ref 1720-003 , ConMed® , Utica , NY , USA ) place prepared skin wrist . A force displacement transducer attach thumb . No special arm board use preload apply thumb entire study procedure . After loss eyelash reflex confirm , neuromuscular monitoring begin immediately . For calibration acceleromyography , 5-s 50-Hz supramaximal tetanic stimulus administer ulnar nerve . Calibration do use CAL2 mode TOF-Watch SX . A supramaximal current obtain initial single twitch calibration . After stabilization control responses , rocuronium ( 0.6 mg/kg ) administer tracheal intubation perform disappearance TOF response . Ventilation adjust maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide 30 35 mm Hg . Train-of-four ( TOF ) stimulation ( 0.2 m duration , frequency 2 Hz , 2 duration supramaximal current ) perform every 15 s. When TOF response could detect , investigator perform post-tetanic count ( PTC ) stimulation manually every 6 min monitor profound neuromuscular block . As soon muscle relaxation longer required surgical dress TOF-Watch SX reading 1 - 2 PTCs , single IV bolus dose sugammadex 4.0 mg/kg administer deep block state . After recovery TOF ratio 0.9 completely confirm , inhalation agent finish . Extubation carry confirm recovery consciousness regular respiration . All neuromuscular data collect computer monitor throughout study . Skin temperature wrist maintain 32°C use wrap cotton wool . Each patient monitor safety 7 day administration study drug . Safety variable comprise report adverse event ( AEs ) ( include serious AEs ) , cod use Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities , vital sign , physical examination , clinical evidence residual neuromuscular block ( NMB ) recurrence NMB . A blind safety assessor performs safety assessment post-operative period follow-up period . The anesthesiologist administer anesthesia surgical procedure blind randomize study drug , safety assessor allow reveal assigned treatment group . Risk factor post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) also assess baseline use assess likelihood occurrence PONV associate study therapy . Subsequent incidence PONV determine AEs cod Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities prefer term nausea , procedural nausea , vomit procedural vomiting .</detailed_description>
