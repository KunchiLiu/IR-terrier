	<brief_summary>This 8-week , randomize , placebo-controlled trial modafinil stable bipolar disorder patient . Results provide information promise treatment simultaneously treat sleep cognitive problem stable bipolar patient . These disable symptom persist despite stable mood strongly associate functional disability , make important treatment target yet adequately addressed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeting Circadian Cognitive Dysfunction Bipolar Disorder With Modafinil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Changes sleep-wake cycle circadian rhythms represent core feature Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) , sleep abnormality approximately 90 % patient acute episode . Even euthymic , many BD patient continue demonstrate circadian disruption , include diminish sleep efficiency low daytime activity level ( Plante , 2008 ) . Moreover , unaffected offspring BD patient demonstrate sleep activity abnormality ( Ankers , 2009 ) , variation within several circadian-related gene ( e.g . CLOCK ) associate risk BD ( Dallaspezia , 2009 ) . These trait-like circadian disruption particular clinical relevance chance sleep highly predictive impend affective instability ( Plante , 2008 ) BD patient poor sleep quality report diminish quality life ( Gruber , 2009 ) . Psychosocial treatment incorporate regulation sleep activity BD successful reduce recurrence , highlight important stabilize circadian rhythm BD ( Frank , 2005 ) ; yet treatment remain suboptimal , date , pharmacological intervention use circadian measure outcomes BD publish . The exact nature circadian abnormality BD know ; theory posit potential uncoupling biological clock external variable entrain circadian rhythm ( e.g . light ) versus desynchronization sleep-wake cycle fall phase biological rhythm ( Dallaspezia , 2009 ) . Euthymic BD patient commonly characterize eveningness chronotype , time-to-sleep preference phase-shifted late average hour , one typically align 24-hour light-dark cycle ( Plante , 2008 ; Ahn , 2008 ) . Potential consequence relate persistent circadian abnormality include significant reduction daytime wakefulness neurocognitive impairment . While sleep deprivation induce single-trial phase-shifts impairs cognition sleep recover , chronic deprivation note BD individual , implicate significant learning memory deficit animal model ( Craig , 2008 ) . Moreover , human unable synchronize normal sleep-wakefulness schedule internal biological clock impair task process speed , work memory , learn ( Wright , 2006 ) . Indeed , majority BD patient demonstrate deficit attention , memory , executive function even affectively stable ( Goldberg &amp; Burdick , 2008 ) . Although several feature illness potentially contribute persistent cognitive impairment note euthymic period , circadian-based deficit sleep quality daytime wakefulness likely exacerbate cognitive problem BD ( Giglio , 2010 ) , show healthy control , sleep disordered subject clinical condition ( Benca , 2009 ) . Preliminary data support relationship BD . The possible influence chronic circadian disruption cognition BD critical importance strong association cognition euthymic functional disability ( Sanchez-Moreno , 2009 ) . When consider agent may simultaneously improve upon sleep quality enhance cognition , wake-promoting agent , modafinil , ideal candidate . It FDA approve improve wakefulness adult excessive daytime sleepiness due primary sleep disorder ( Provigil , 2007 ) characterize psychostimulant differentiate amphetamine low liability abuse favorable risk profile . Modafinil show enhance cognition healthy control , sleep-disordered individual , neurological patient , patient schizophrenia ( Minzenberg , 2008 ) . Preliminary data indicate modafinil safe effective adjunctive depress BD patient , risk mania-induction v placebo ( Frye , 2007 ) ; however yet systematic trial euthymic BD patient sleep cognitive dysfunction outcome measure . Thus , adjunctive modafinil ( 200 mg/day ) v placebo administer 48 euthymic patient BD 8 week three specific aim : 1 . To evaluate safety adjunctive modafinil euthymic BD . Adverse event carefully measure recorded effort determine base rate common side effect BD . Specifically , mood psychosis rating conduct weekly address potential modafinil exacerbate manic and/or psychotic symptom . 2 . To evaluate effect adjunctive modafinil euthymic BD measure sleep quality daytime wakefulness . Patients ' subjective experience sleep disruption daytime wakefulness measure weekly use several standard questionnaire daily diary . 3 . To evaluate effect adjunctive modafinil euthymic BD measure neurocognition . Cognitive function assayed use MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery supplement several domain-specific task baseline , 4-weeks , end 8-week study .</detailed_description>
