	<brief_summary>This research put liver biopsy enrollment screen criterion primary efficacy assessment indicator . Patients different developmental stage hepatitis B relate liver fibrosis respectively diagnose treated Traditional Chinese medicine determine optional diagnosis treatment plan traditional Chinese medicine screen advantage-treated population establish treatment program , save national medical resource , clinical application Traditional Chinese medicine Diagnosis Treatment block reverse hepatitis B-related liver fibrosis . The research help build automation pathological analysis diagnosis system non-invasive clinical assessment criterion model liver fibrosis applied clinical . It also help realize electronic patient data collection management , establish patient management centre follow-up database . Then help improve clinical efficacy block reversed chronic hepatitis B relate liver fibrosis Chinese medicine Diagnosis Treatment program , reduce incidence liver cirrhosis hepatitis B-related mortality , prolong patient ' survival improve patient ' quality life , make clinical efficacy , Traditional Chinese Medicine block revere chronic hepatitis B-related liver fibrosis , increase 15 % .</brief_summary>
