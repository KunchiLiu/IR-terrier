	<brief_summary>Adult-onset vitelliform detachment associated pattern dystrophy genetic disorder carry visual implication commonly affect macula ( area eye near retina essential sharp central vision ) . Adult onset vitelliform detachment accumulation material outer retina . Over time , abnormal accumulation material damage cell critical clear central vision . As result , people disorder often lose central vision , eyesight may become blurry distort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subretinal fluid think play role formation vitelliform detachment , associate progressive vision loss . Fluid subretinal space disrupts physical apposition photoreceptor outer segment retinal pigment epithelial cell , may turn hind phagocytosis shed photoreceptor outer segment . Material derive unphagocytized outer segment may accumulate subretinal space form vitelliform lesion , result persistent detachment . Anti-VEGF therapy form intravitreal aflibercept injection may useful control eliminate subretinal fluid , thus promote contact photoreceptor outer segment retinal pigment epithelium . Vitelliform detachment may resolve subsequent removal subretinal fluid restoration contact-dependent mechanism photoreceptor out segment recycling .</detailed_description>
