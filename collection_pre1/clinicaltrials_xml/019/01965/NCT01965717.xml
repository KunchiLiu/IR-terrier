	<detailed_description>1 . Summary Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) provide low early mortality require intensive follow patient order prevent rupture consequence endoleak . Follow protocols change time differ hospital even physician . Ultrasonography ( US ) , contrast enhance ultrasonography , multisliced compute tomography ( MSCT ) native radiography frequently use . All technique combine order compensate lack disadvantage . The new method early detection endoleak improve cumbersome follow process . Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity demonstrate process aneurysm development . Higher level MMP-9 discover patient inadequate aneurysm exclusion endovascular procedure suggest degradation aortic wall still ongoing process might potential role MMP-9 serum level biomarker endoleak detection . Aim study explore serum level MMP - 9 patient treat endovascular aneurysm repair provide profound information regard ' correlation different type endoleak . Patients treat EVAR follow least one year . During five visit , first preoperative , discharge , one , six twelve month , patient examine mean US MSCT . During five visit serum level MMP -9 measure correlated different level aneurysm exclusion . Collected anatomical , demographic data patient intraoperative data related technical success procedure provide subgroup patient high correlation aneurysm exclusion serum level MMP -9 . The primary outcome measure serum level MMP - 9 one , six twelve month treatment relation anatomical , demographic procedure relate data . Clinical outcome event include different type endoleak . The secondary outcome correlation different type endoleak serum level MMP - 9 . This study design multicentre recruit 150 patient 24-month period . Leading center Clinic Vascular Endovascular Surgery Serbian Clinical centre . Participating center able perform EVAR , follow patient US MSCT four time first year detect serum level MMP - 9 . All analysis perform individually participate centre encourage use technique lead center . Individual experience collaborator participate centre record inclusion study . 2 . Background Endovascular procedure already bring enormous revolution process treatment patient abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) . It well define early mortality morbidity significantly reduce compare open repair . The persistent concern long term durability device success aneurysm exclusion order prevent rupture . At moment best armamentarium prevent rupture endovascular exclusion watchful wait timely reintervention . The main complication follow procedure cause catastrophic long term complication endoleak . The ideal algorithm follow patient aneurysm exclusion find . In order reveal endoleak ultrasound use , however frequent computerize tomography wasting lot cost expose patient irradiation nephrotoxic contrast . Matrix metalloproteinase activity demonstrate process aneurysm development . Imbalance MMP inhibitor TIMP provokes colagenolitic elastolytic activity induce aneurysmatic degeneration aortic wall . Due previously describe connection aneurysm MMP activity , prove serum level MMP-9 significantly high patient abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) . Also , high level MMP-9 discover patient inadequate aneurysm exclusion endovascular procedure suggest degradation aortic wall still ongoing process , case successfully exclude aneurysm . There might potential role MMP-9 serum level biomarker present endoleak endovascular aneurysm exclusion . All publish trial show correlation MMP 9 activity presence endoleak , however , correlation make base level specific type endoleak necessity reoperation ( clinical significance ) . Additionally four trial present literature investigate low number patient 1,2,3,4 . 3 . Aims trial hypothesis The basic research question whether level MMP -9 change endovascular aneurysm exclusion curve level active MMP-9 concentration first year procedure . We hypothesize level MMP-9 active concentration decline , however might dependent factor . Secondary research question : 1 . What role pre-treatment serum level MMP - 9 patient AAA ? We hypothesize pre operative serum level MMP - 9 predictor sensitivity endoleak detection postoperative follow . 2 . What role serum level MMP - 9 biomarker early successful aneurysm exclusion ? We hypothesize serum level MMP - 9 early postoperative time ( first week one month ) could biomarker successful aneurysm exclusion 3 . What role serum level MMP - 9 differentiate type endoleak ? We hypothesize different serum level MMP - 9 could find patient different type endoleak . 4 . What role serum level MMP - 9 reintervetion due present endoleak ? We hypothesize level endoleak decline successful re-treatment 5 . What role serum level MMP - 9 predictor aneurysm sac enlargement ? We hypothesize serum level MMP - 9 early postoperative time ( one month ) could correlate sac enlargement patient visible endoleak . 4 . Study design 4.1 .
