	<brief_summary>Hyperphosphatemia related increase morbidity mortality . There great risk cardiovascular disease , atherosclerotic disease , secondary hyperparathyroidism , bone disease . The serum phosphorus level control combination factor , : reduction ingestion , reduction intestinal absorption chelate agent increase elimination dialysis . The purpose study evaluate effect dietary intervention consist restriction industrialize food phosphorus additives chronic kidney disease patient treat hemodialysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Restriction Foods Containing Phosphorus Additives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The consumption food contain phosphorus patient hemodialysis monitor order reflect current reality , due increase ingestion industrialize food rich phosphorus additive . Data study perform USA show reduction phosphatemia nutritional orientation reduce food contain additive restaurant region study . In another study , also conduct USA , researcher evaluate phosphorus content presence additives appetizer side order serve fast food restaurant Cleveland . The result show appetizer , 52 % accept traditional criterion renal diet ( low content sodium , potassium organic natural phosphorus ) , 16 % also free phosphorus additive ; side order , 23 % accept traditional criterion 17 % exempt phosphorus additive . Thus , small proportion appetizer side order serve fast food restaurant compatible renal diet . Considering alimentary phosphorus important role control phosphatemia , lack study evaluate effect food contain phosphorus additive phosphatemia , time , evaluate alimentary ingestion nutritional state chronic kidney disease patient treat hemodialysis . Can elimination food contain phosphorus additive substitution food without additive reduce phosphatemia without alter nutritional state hyperphosphatemic patient hemodialysis ?</detailed_description>
