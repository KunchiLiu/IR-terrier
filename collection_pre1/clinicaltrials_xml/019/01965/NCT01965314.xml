	<brief_summary>Investigators hypothesize virtual reality base train offer additional learning benefit standard training ( use cadaveric dissection human volunteer ) prepare novice anaesthetist perform first Ultrasound guide Axillary Brachial Plexus Blockade ( USgABPB ) clinical setting . Investigators hope body work aid development visuo-haptic simulator use improved training doctor perform USgABPB . Ultimately patient procedure carry future benefit . In particular avoid need novice trainee practice new technique patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Determine Effect Simulation Based Training Initial Performance Ultrasound Guided Axillary Brachial Plexus Blockade Clinical Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound guide axillary brachial plexus blockade ( USgABPB ) commonly perform medical procedure enable performance surgery upper limb without general anaesthesia . Its competent performance entail complex , simultaneous interaction three process . These active management patient , acquisition interpretation ultrasound image , placement needle tip close specific nerve facilitate deposition local anaesthetic . Currently , procedure teach use two-dimensional drawing , cadaveric specimen , video , 3D animation , live demonstration , and/or supervise clinical practice . Simulated practice , use tofu-based animal model , use bridge gap knowledge clinical performance . Training medical procedural skill currently undergo important change . Factors include altered patient expectation European Working Time Directive ( 2000/34/EC amend Directive 93/104/EC ) limit number clinical learning opportunity available trainee . These change likely decrease particularly number opportunity trainees learn practice procedural skill clinical setting . The traditional Halstedian apprenticeship model medical training challenge . In model , train associate progressively less supervision part progressive independence . `` See one , one '' long appropriate method teach procedural skill patient necessarily expose inexperienced practitioner . This model require large investment time trainer trainee clinical environment . Its application decrease efficiency operate room activity . These circumstance pose medical trainer train body dilemma , decrease number individual opportunity implies total duration training increase less level competence accept completion training Simulation use widely train assessment medical procedural skill . Applied essential anaesthetic skill , simulation may efficient apprenticeship approach . This may offer partial solution problem limit clinical learning opportunity USgPNB . Simulated practice formative feedback show benefit rapid acquisition basic ultrasound skill inexperienced clinician . Ultimately , purpose simulated practice medical procedure enhance clinical performance . One proven important role simulation prepare novice clinician bridge gap acquire knowledge initial clinical performance . Significantly , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently mandate clinician perform carotid stenting use particular stent train define level proficiency simulator perform procedure patient . With institutional ethical approval obtain write informed consent participant ( patient anaesthetist ) 20 College Anaesthetists ( RCSI ) affiliate trainee experience perform ultrasound guide regional anaesthesia recruit . Participating anaesthetist provide baseline personal data include previous experience peripheral nerve blockade simulator , use web-based collection facility ( www.surveymonkey.com similar ) . They perform baseline psychomotor test prior begin train . Baseline visuo-spatial ability assess use card rotation , cube comparison , map planning test ( Educational Testing Service ) similar . Psychomotor ability assess use groove pegboard ( Lafayette Instruments , Lafayette , IN ) similar . All participate anaesthetist receive standardize two hour didactic training encompass relevant anatomy , ultrasound ( physic , function interpretation ) , pharmacology relevant agent , indications/ contraindication block complication procedure . Participants teach perform USgABPB use technique describe Appendix IV V 'The American Society Regional Anesthesia Pain Medicine European Society Regional Anaesthesia Pain Therapy Joint Committee Recommendations Education Training Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia ' . This technique use transverse ( short-axis ) view , ultrasound imaging , axillary brachial plexus axillary blood vessel . The needle insert sterile fashion use 'in-plane ' approach , , needle shaft tip remain visible ultrasound view throughout course towards relevant nerve . Following initial period common training subject randomly allocate ( use computer generate random number ) one two group equal size additional training occur parallel two hour period , namely simulator train group ( SG ) control group ( CG ) . Following educational intervention subject ask give write feedback content delivery session . Traditional training TG subject offer multimodal training . This comprised demonstration suitably trained individual relevant anatomy use pre-existing cadaveric sample , perform ultrasound scan relevant area volunteer expert supervision , practice needle insertion ultrasound-guidance use commonly use tissue phantom ( turkey breast ) . All ultrasound examination perform volunteer clinical performance patient use Sonosite M Turbo ( similar device ) 7-12 MHz 38mm linear probe . This training session last two hour . Simulator training In addition traditional training SG group participate period simulator base training . Following initial familiarization simulator SG participant identify relevant structure follow course virtual arm . They insert virtual needle virtual environment advance use in-plane technique towards various target structure . They give immediate direct feedback expert offer opportunity repetitive , deliberate practice . The simulator , SG participant use , comprise PHANTOM Desktop ( http : //www.sensable.com/ ) , haptic immersive workbench H3D API ( http : //www.sensegraphics.se/ ) . The SG subject scan perform procedure specific task virtual arm . The model arm inform use MRI ultrasound supervolume DICOM datasets . This training session last two hour . Assessment Within two week educational intervention participant ' first clinical performance ultrasound guide nerve block , specifically ultrasound guide axillary brachial plexus blockade , video record subsequent analysis two expert UGRA . Patients involved require anaesthesia forearm/wrist/hand surgery USgABPB would ordinarily offer standard care . Subsequent care patient may include general anaesthesia , clinically indicate . Intravenous sedation offer administer clinically indicate ( Midazolam maximum 0.05mg/kg ) . Subjects perform procedure , use in-plane approach short-axis view ( see ) , presence supervise trainer , blind training group , available intervene require , patient safety , request subject . Patients involve also blind subject allocation . Using video record device Sony Handycam HDR-XR520VE , similar , performance clinician indicate USgABPB schedule operation patient record . The video-taping target primarily anaesthetist perform clinically indicate ultrasound guide regional anaesthetic technique usual fashion Cork University Hospital . The record proceed manner aim conceal identity patient maintain confidentiality . All effort take ensure record include image patient face . For purpose blinding , similar effort make conceal identity anaesthetist perform block avoid shot face . The record include pan shot setup room block take place . This indicate location patient , ultrasound machine , trolley sterile equipment require , assistant , monitor , emergency drug , anaesthetist perform block . Before commence block camera fix position focus axilla , needle insertion site , ultrasound probe movement anaesthetist 's hand record . The acquire ultrasound image record concurrently . After expert assessment trainee performance completion dataset record video destroyed . For purpose study subject give specific direction . 1 . Position patient equipment appropriately . 2 . They ask perform pre-procedure ultrasonic survey relevant area , specifically identify four relevant nerve ( musculocutaneous , radial , median , ulnar ) . 3 . Perform sterile four nerve ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block , utilize single skin entry point ( possible ) , short axis view brachial plexus , needle in-plane approach . 4 . They ask demonstrate effectiveness blockade . Following recorded performance procedure subject ask complete write questionnaire indicate confidence perform procedure perception influence external stressor ( include presence camera ) .</detailed_description>
