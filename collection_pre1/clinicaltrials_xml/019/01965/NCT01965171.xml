	<brief_summary>Red cell transfusion important part supportive cancer therapy . The iron transfuse blood may build body since human body way get rid extra iron . Iron tend build liver heart muscle . It unknown iron build-up present many year complete cancer therapy . It also know extra iron cause harm internal organ . Researchers St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) want understand iron build-up ( call `` iron overload '' ) exist survivor leukemia . They also want know iron overload cause injury organ present . Liver iron accumulation document childhood cancer survivor , however , know iron associate organ toxicity contribute long-term morbidity well document among survivor . This study investigate prevalence iron overload association tissue iron burden marker organ dysfunction leukemia survivor . This study determine prevalence iron overload among long-term leukemia survivor underwent blood transfusion . This study use blood magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) test determine iron overload specify organ . Understanding prevalence iron overload could impact surveillance practice leukemia survivor . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To determine prevalence iron overload liver [ liver iron concentration ( LIC ) &gt; 3mg/g use R2* MRI measurement ] heart ( T2* &lt; 20 m ) among long-term leukemia survivor transfuse ≥50ml/kg pack red blood cell . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To examine relationship hepatic , cardiac , endocrine dysfunction transfusionally acquire iron overload define R2* T2* MRI among survivor pediatric leukemia . - To investigate association serum ferritin , transferrin saturation , non-transferrin-bound iron , hepcidin measurement R2* T2* MRI-defined iron overload .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants blood work drawn overnight fast routine clinic visit . They also electrocardiogram ( EKG ) echocardiogram ( ECHO ) often required part annual visit . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) exams heart , liver , surround abdominal organ do participant use method scan involves closer study organ ( call R2* MRI ) .</detailed_description>
