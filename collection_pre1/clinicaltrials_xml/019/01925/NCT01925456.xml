	<brief_summary>A . Objectives &amp; Hypothesis Overactive bladder ( OAB ) affect 10 million adult United States year substantial cost incurred private public fund test efficacy new exist drug OAB.14 However , effectiveness adherence data traditional clinical trial generalizable clinical practice.3 , 4 In era limited resource compete demand , essential cost-effectiveness data clinical trial generalizable clinical world . Pragmatic clinical trial measure effectiveness treatment real clinical practice , full spectrum patient require treatment.5 Pragmatic trial require patient report outcomes valid low patient burden.5 The conduct pragmatic clinical trial OAB limit lack instrument demonstrable validity reliability typical clinical setting Pill count , used measure primary outcome traditional trial , burdensome clinical setting.1610 The optimal instrument measure utility score , general quality life score cost-effectiveness analysis OAB , also know . Although poor adherence carry potential continue suffer patient waste health care resource , lack data clinical economic impact poor adherence treatment OAB real-world clinical practice . We publish preliminary data underscore role adherence utility treatment OAB . 3 Our hypothesis effectiveness , adherence , utility preference score measure use pragmatic patient report instrument poor adherence associate low effectiveness quality life adult OAB clinical setting . Specifically , override goal proposal validate pragmatic instrument measure effectiveness , adherence utility preference score obtain preliminary data effect adherence quality life adult undergoing treatment overactive bladder clinical setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To determine validity responsiveness pragmatic patient report outcome instrument measure clinical effectiveness , adherence utility preference score adults undergoing treatment anti-cholinergic medication overactive bladder . We perform prospective cohort study adult OAB undergo treatment anti-cholinergic medication . We compare improvement urinary symptom ( clinical effectiveness ) , adherence , change utility preference score baseline 3 month treatment use new exist 'gold standard ' instrument . The result informative , pragmatic instrument , useful measure effectiveness , adherence , utility preference score 'real world ' clinical setting . Specific Aim 2 : To use newly validate pragmatic instrument measure impact adherence clinical effectiveness health relate quality life real world clinical setting adult undergoing treatment anti-cholinergic medication overactive bladder . The impact adherence clinical effectiveness health relate quality life measure comparison adult high low adherence anti-cholinergic medication . This aim corroborate finding aim 1 establish pragmatic instrument useful measure outcome effectiveness , adherence utility preference score . These result also provide preliminary data effectiveness anti-cholinergic medication impact adherence clinical effectiveness quality life clinical setting .</detailed_description>
