	<brief_summary>This study measure speed gas move middle-ear air-space blood flow middle-ear lining . The middle ear rigid biological gas pocket locate behind eardrum fill gas air , primarily oxygen ( O ) , nitrogen ( N ) carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , different proportion . The middle ear line thin layer cell overlie tissue surround blood vessel . The blood flow middle-ear lining also contain gas different proportion atmosphere ( room air ) middle ear . Because difference proportion gas , gas tends flow middle ear blood try make proportion gas compartment . This flow gas middle ear change middle-ear pressure . If middle-ear pressure decrease much air pressure atmosphere , ability hear sound impaired fluid build middle ear . It expect different gas move middle ear blood different speed , know speed gas . It also expect speed different ear middle-ear disease . In study , measure speed nitrogen , oxygen carbon dioxide exchange direction middle ear blood . To , gas mixture middle ear change movement one gas experiment measure change amount gas middle ear . This do use special instrument call mass spectrometer open , work tympanostomy ( ventilation ) tube , small plastic tube , eardrum . For participant study , conduct 6 experiment last 2 hour measure speed nitrogen , oxygen carbon dioxide flow . Subjects without tympanostomy tube recruit . Those without tube tube insert one ear study purpose remove end study ; subject follow weekly hole eardrum ( tube ) close .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adequate middle ear ( ME ) pressure-regulation , define maintenance total ME pressure approximately ambient level , require normal hearing preserve ME health . The mechanism ME pressure-regulation consist two distinct component affect total ME gas pressure : bolus , total gradient drive exchange gas ME nasopharynx active , transient Eustachian tube ( ET ) opening passive , partial-pressure gradient drive diffusive exchange gas ME cavity adjacent compartment include local blood via ME mucosa ( MEM ) environment via tympanic membrane . The basic physiology gas transfer ET well establish slow negligible gas exchange across normal inflamed tympanic membrane measure chinchilla , cat monkey , confirm u human . In contrast , characteristic transMEM gas exchange controversial . Mathematical modeling show transMEM gas exchange control ME pressure trajectory ET open relative rate exchange different physiologic gas defines demand place ET ME gas resupply . Here , empirically measure transMEM ME-to-blood blood-to-ME exchange constant physiologic gas human normal inflamed MEMs . For purpose , total 20 otherwise healthy adult subject , 10 significant history ME ear disease ( Group-1 ) 10 least 1 functional ventilation tube ( VT ) insert extant ME disease ( Group-2 ) . Group-1 subject VT insertion local anesthetic research clinic , subject , custom-made acrylic ear-plug fabricate fit sensor measuring pressure , syringe adjust system pressure micro-tubing allow periodic gas sample composition analysis online mass-spectrometer . All subject undergo series six transMEM gas exchange experiment , experiment design establish ME-to-blood blood-to-ME partial-pressure gradient one 3 physiologic gas , N2 , O2 CO2 . During experiment , ear-plug insert seal within ear canal . The ear-plug attached valve line lead mass-spectrometer known composition gas source , system ( ear-plug + ME ) wash test gas specific experiment . Then , ear-plug close gas source , 60 90 minute duration experiment , system pressure record continuously ME gas sample take 10 minute interval composition analysis . The data transform estimate transMEM conductance ( exchange constant ) test gas . On last day experimental series , Group-2 subject dismiss ; Group-1 subject VT remove follow weekly tympanic membrane perforation heal . At time , audiometry perform VT insertion repeat . The result use complete mathematical model ME pressure-regulation ME transition health disease . These empirical data also use evaluate certain hypothesis related limitation place exchange gas specie regard directional symmetry exchange process .</detailed_description>
