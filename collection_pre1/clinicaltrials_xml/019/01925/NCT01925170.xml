	<brief_summary>A new test breast cancer screening , molecular breast imaging ( MBI ) may sensitive mammography detect breast cancer woman dense breast . The purpose study see MBI use low dose gamma radiation find cancer see mammography . Hypotheses : 1 . Low-Dose MBI significantly high sensitivity specificity equal higher positive predictive value SM woman age 40 old mammographically dense breast . 2 . Low-dose MBI comparable sensitivity specificity previously achieve MBI use high dose radiation . 3 . MBI produce low false positive rate ( specificity &gt; 90 % ) permit use screen tool patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A previous study demonstrate addition MBI use 20 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi screen mammography ( SM ) increase diagnostic yield breast cancer dense breast ( supplemental yield 7.5/1000 screen ) . After implement radiation dose reduction technique , performance incident SM prevalent screen MBI woman dense breast compare . Methods : Women present SM heterogeneously extremely dense breast past prior SM enrol underwent digital SM MBI . Study information send eligible patient advance schedule SM explain study offer participation . Eligible patient request participate offer MBI day SM within 21 day SM . Participants may participate screen study two time provide least 24 month elapse since initial MBI scan . This time period select average time tumor double size approximately 20 month . Hence 24 month time interval MBI study enable detection interval cancer cancer small detect initial MBI scan . MBI perform 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi dual-head cadmium zinc telluride detector . SMs read independently ; MBIs read comparison SM . MBIs assign assessment score 1-5 parallel BI-RADS ; score 3-5 MBI consider positive .</detailed_description>
