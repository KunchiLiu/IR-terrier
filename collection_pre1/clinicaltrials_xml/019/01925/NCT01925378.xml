	<detailed_description>2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1 Cervical Cancer Etiology Targets Intervention Cervical cancer one common cause cancer-related death woman worldwide . Implementation widespread screening create drastic improvement incidence cervical cancer well significant decrease mortality last 30 year . It estimate 2011 , 12,710 woman US diagnose cervical cancer ultimately 4,290 woman die disease . Cervical cancer unique exist well-defined pre-malignant phase , refer cervical dysplasia , suspect cytological examination ( pap smear ) exfoliate cervical cell confirm histological examination cervical biopsy material . The pre-cancerous change represent spectrum histological abnormality cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) range CIN 1 ( mild dysplasia ) CIN2 ( moderate dysplasia ) CIN3 ( severe dysplasia/ carcinoma situ ) . The timeline progression CIN 3 invasive cancer untreated woman average 8.1 12.6 years.The surgical treatment cervical pre-cancerous therapeutically efficacious . However , invasive procedure associate fertility obstetrical complication reproductive age woman . An attractive alternative excisional ablative procedure would utilize agent could apply topically take mouth foster regression cervical dysplasia . The use natural , synthetic , biologic chemical agent reverse , suppress , prevent carcinogenic progression call chemoprevention . A prerequisite cervical cancer persistent infection high-risk human papillomavirus allow viral gene product sufficient time induce carcinogenesis generally well understood natural history . Cancer-associated HPV type encode three oncogene , E5 , E6 E7 , E6 E7 proteins significant role malignant transformation . E6 E7 stimulate cell proliferation interfere function regulatory protein cell , include tumor suppressor p53 pRB . Co-expression E6 E7 lead indefinite proliferation immortalization keratinocytes induces premalignant neoplasm . HPV-E5 , transmembrane protein , activate PI3K-Akt signalling . The up-regulation PI3K-Akt survival signal protects HPV-16 E5-expressing cell apoptosis induce ultraviolet irradiation . The major transforming capability HPV dependent E6 E7 . However , E5 necessary full activation E7 , induction PI3K-Akt-dependent apoptotic inhibition E5 contribute E7-mediated oncogenesis . The work do evaluate PI3K activity potential marker CIN progression support idea pathway also up-regulated pre-cancerous lesion . The catalytic subunit alpha PI3K express non-invasive cervical lesion show potential carcinogenesis-related marker early intraepithelial lesion uterine cervix cytology sample . Among potential marker , PIK3CA show superior specificity distinguish CIN3 group . Yao et al 2008 show positive rate PI3K Akt significantly low normal cervical epithelium cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cervical carcinoma ( 0.0 % 42.9 % vs. 69.7 % , P &lt; 0.01 ; 10.0 % 52.4 % vs. 75.0 % , P &lt; 0.01 ) . Specifically , PI3K/Akt activation increase grade dysplasia invasive carcinoma high activity . They also show expression PI3K protein positively correlated expression Akt protein ( r=0.425 , P &lt; 0.01 ) . 2.2 Nelfinavir ( NFV ) Background Nelfinavir ( NFV ) induce cell cycle arrest , endoplasmic reticulum stress , autophagy , apoptosis cancer cell . As protease inhibitor use patient HIV , NFV predominately target proteases 1 2 , also know part efficacy due selective inhibition proteosome . The pathogenecity high risk HPV dependent expression viral E6 proteins inappropriately activate 26S proteosome degrade p53 cellular protein detrimental viral replication ; specific HIV protease inhibitor block ability HPV16 E6 degrade p53 selectively kill E6-dependent cervical carcinoma cell . Furthermore , HIV protease inhibitor show inhibit PI3K/Akt signal pathway NFV potent . NFV 's mechanism action involve decrease Akt phosphorylation . In addition , concentration ( micromolar ) achievable serum patient take usual dose drug ( 1250mg PO BID ) , Akt phosphorylation inhibit . At institution , show HPV-infected cervical cancer cell line treat NFV underwent apoptosis decrease cell proliferation dose dependent manner . Furthermore , show recent retrospective study HIV-infected woman cervical dysplasia treat protease inhibitor ( PI ) , include NFV likely regress PI-containing regimen . Because PI3K/Akt up-regulated CIN2/3 NFV show inhibit pathway HPV-infected cervical cancer cell line , aim evaluate effectiveness NFV intervention CIN2/3 correlate finding phospho-Akt level cervical tissue . Several intervention trial conduct woman CIN use retinoids , ß-carotene , difluoromethylornithine , indole-3- carbinol 300 woman CIN 3 follow trial one 15 month none develop invasive cervical cancer . Therefore , propose intervention trial 24 week ( 6 month ) duration allow safe evaluation NFV potential agent future randomize Phase III trial . Development new drug cancer treatment expensive time consume . Repositioning drug already FDA approve another indication allow rapid evaluation potential implementation novel cancer therapy . NFV identify anti-cancer effect vitro , compare protease inhibitor potent cause cell death . NFV 10 year safety pharmacokinetic data HIV-infected individual . Standard dose treatment HIV 1,250 mg PO BID , dose demonstrate plasma concentration vivo correlate necessary concentration successful vitro study . Furthermore , evaluation standard dose offer availability commercially produce tablet , know acceptable side effect profile , ease twice daily dose . For reason NFV excellent candidate reposition intervention cervical dysplasia , quickly evaluate phase II clinical trial .</detailed_description>
