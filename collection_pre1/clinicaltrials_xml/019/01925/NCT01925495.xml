	<brief_summary>This study determine reflex detect change eardrum position pressure middle-ear gas respond change ease Eustachian tube open . The Eustachian tube normal tube connects middle ear nose . It usually close , open contraction 2 small muscle surround tube . If Eustachian tube open frequently enough , pressure middle ear decrease , eardrum pull toward middle ear cause hearing loss , fluid accumulate middle ear try stabilize pressure . There evidence change eardrum position middle-ear pressure Eustachian tube open frequently enough detected brain , turn , send signal Eustachian tube muscle make Eustachian tube open easy . In study , test possibility . Specifically , 3 experiment do 5 different day , move eardrum , apply different pressure middle ear , change composition gas middle ear measure difficult open Eustachian tube increase middle-ear pressure measure `` readiness '' Eustachian tube muscle contract open tube .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adequate middle ear ( ME ) pressure-regulation , define maintenance total ME pressure approximately ambient level , require normal hearing preserve ME health . The mechanism ME pressure-regulation consist two distinct component affect total ME gas pressure : bolus , total gradient drive exchange gas ME nasopharynx active , transient Eustachian tube ( ET ) opening passive , partial-pressure gradient drive diffusive exchange gas ME cavity adjacent compartment . A large number past study describe basic physiology gas transfer ET human , explore possibility physiological feedback mechanism could modulate ET functional efficiency . However , anatomic foundation support feedback modulation ET function result experiment animal lend credibility possibility . Theoretically , sensory component possible feedback pathway could consist stretch sensor tympanic membrane ( TM ; detect position ) tensor tympani muscle ( detect tension ) and/or chemo- ( detect gas pressure ) / baro- ( detect total pressure ) receptor ME mucosa effector component consist rest Tensor Veli Palatini muscle ( mTVP ) tonus and/or extant ET periluminal pressure . In study , explore 3 hypothesize stimulus-effector pairing 10 otherwise healthy adult subject history significant ME disease normal audiologic testing . Custom ear plug make use Visits 2-6 . The protocol include 1 screen visit 3 experiment require 5 experimental session approximately 3-5 hour duration do minimum interval 2 day . Briefly , Experiment 1 ( Visit 2 ) , ear canal pressure vary change position TM simultaneously monitor mTVP tonus electromyography ( EMG ) . Then , unilateral ventilation tube ( VT ) insert TM allow access ME cavity . For Experiment 2 , ( Visits 3-5 ) , ME wash physiologic , hypercarbic , hyperoxic gas composition ( reference ME normal ) monitoring ET periluminal tissue pressure measure ET resistance gas flow . For Experiment 3 ( Visit 6 ) , total ME pressure vary monitoring mTVP tonus EMG . At completion Experiment 3 , VT remove , , subject followed weekly ( Visits 7+ ) document heal TM time standard audiologic assessment do . If hypothesis support , select activation feedback mechanism would improve ET function could exploit one component treatment protocol improve ME pressure-regulation .</detailed_description>
