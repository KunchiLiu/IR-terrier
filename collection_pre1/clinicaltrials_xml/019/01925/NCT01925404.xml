	<brief_summary>Encouraging great level physical activity critical improving health among Americans , largely sedentary . Neighborhood parks resource physical activity available Americans within couple mile home , yet many resident unaware program facility available . Previous research indicate park use relate park program outreach . Because fund park limit , low-cost intervention need attract people parks engage moderate-to-vigorous physical activity . While many community-based organization would like invest effort increase physical activity , low-cost park program document scalable cost-effective . Effective program replicate make population-level impact need . The goal study develop test 2 low-cost community-level approach , free exercise class vs. frequent user program , promote physical activity , singly combination , 48 park setting Los Angeles low-income neighborhood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While routine physical activity critical optimal health , preliminary study indicate resident low-income community Los Angeles less likely exercise high-income community , less likely use neighborhood park , even park within walk distance . Parks low-income neighborhood tend small serve great population density , even account size population serve , still use less parks wealthy neighborhood . In preliminary study find park low-income neighborhood also few part-time staff offer few program organize activity park higher-income area , factor partly account low use . As well , park low-income neighborhood often perceive less safe , characteristic associate low use 4 . Simultaneously , lack use dearth programming may contribute perception lack safety , create vicious cycle . Nonetheless , document parks low-income neighborhood offer event activity , busy park higher-income area . We hypothesize limited park use low-income area attribute lack organize reliable infrastructure activity meet need local resident offer activity program park increase park use park-based physical activity . According Task Force Community Level Preventive Services , community-level campaign effective scalable.6 For past eight year , conduct research public neighborhood park find venue offer great potential increase physical activity population . Based upon work , well previous work cost-effectiveness physical activity intervention , propose test community-level campaign target low-income population relatively low-cost easy replicate . The propose study three specific aim : 1 . Using full factorial design , compare whether park use population physical activity low-income neighborhood increase availability ) organize physical activity class , include zumba , line dancing , aerobics indoors outdoors , and/or b ) loyalty program approach reward frequent park user . 2 . Determine whether either two approach change perception park safety neighborhood safety . 3 . Identify cost effectiveness approach term dollar spent generate increase physical activity park measure systematic observation . Most Los Angeles park full-time staff , role become increasingly administrative . Park staff may time skill lead physical activity program activity conduct effective outreach community promote activity . Although small literature `` best practice '' park , underlie foundation rigorous scientific research , identification park practice , design , activity lead physical activity community . Standard practice currently base primarily anecdote , demand special interest group , experience professional . The science objectively measure physical activity park new , develop past decade . Because neighborhood park setting design moderate vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) accessible 70 % US population , identify program help population achieve physical activity goal reasonable cost would highly useful , particularly group disproportionately affect chronic disease could reduce physical activity . Parks community resource typically fund dedicated revenue stream fee-based program , yet park system frequently lack tools resource either market program measure reach effectiveness . Our study document step require implement maintain two physical activity promotion intervention -- one standard approach offer traditional organized physical activity program , innovative application popular customer loyalty program . We determine impact physical activity cost-effectiveness .</detailed_description>
