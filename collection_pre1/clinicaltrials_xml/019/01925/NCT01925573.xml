	<brief_summary>This protocol design generate provide preliminary data determine safety activity combination therapy use tumor treat field ( TTFields ; Optune ( NovoTTF-100A ) ; Novocure , Haifa , Israel ) , novel FDA-approved therapy utilize alternate electric field inhibit tumor cell growth , along bevacizumab ( Avastin ; Genentech , San Francisco , CA ) , humanize monoclonal antibody inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy , highly-focal abbreviated course brain irradiation , treatment patient bevacizumab-naive recurrent GBM . Each individual therapy , also several combination doublet , already demonstrate safety efficacy prospective clinical data concurrent combination three therapy lack .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optune ( NOVOTTF-100A ) + Bevacizumab+ Hypofractionated Stereotactic Irradiation Bevacizumab-Naive Recurrent Glioblastoma ( GCC 1344 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination Optune ( NovoTTF ) active regimen bevacizumab hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy base addition effective new treatment set safe regimen favorable survival report . To date , clinical data available interaction concomitant tumor treat field radiation therapy either without bevacizumab . TTF radiation potential enhance 's therapeutic ratio though synergistic mechanism action . The addition bevacizumab regimen therapeutic improved-toxicity implication . A trial combine Optune proven regimen HFSRT bevacizumab recurrent glioblastoma affords avenue demonstrate safety population may readily derive benefit novel multimodality therapy explore potential synergistic effect . The endpoint efficacy would clearly need definitively addressed future categorical trial , would logical positive outcome pilot study .</detailed_description>
