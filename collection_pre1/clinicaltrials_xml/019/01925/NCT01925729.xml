	<brief_summary>This study determine exposure allergy material ( ragweed ) exposure allergic-symptom-provoking substance ( histamine ) medication typically use decongest nose change rate blood-flow lining middle-ear . Otitis medium ( build-up water-like fluid middle-ear airspace ) may occur blood flow line middle-ear high may prevent way could find low blood flow person susceptible disease . Middle-ear blood flow measure indirectly measure change middle-ear pressure person breathes gas mixture contain nitrous oxide ( `` laugh gas '' ) . In study , 4 group subject enter middle-ear pressure person breathe mixture 50 % Oxygen , 50 % Nitrous Oxide ( `` laugh gas '' ) measure exposure one four substance ( ragweed , histamine , oral decongestant , decongestant nasal spray ) fake medication ( placebo ) separate test session . All subject one set 2 x-rays middle ear mastoid . The group expose ragweed require 3 study visit 3 group 2 study visit . From information middle-ear blood flow calculate . This help determine relationship happen nose happens middle ear .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TransMEM Gas Exchange -- Project 1 , Aim 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The set four experiment describe subcomponent one Project include Clinical Research Center Grant Program focus physiology pathophysiology middle-ear ( ME ) pressure-regulation child adult . These experiment design measure rate transME mucosal ( transMEM ) inert gas exchange adult determine nasal inflammatory reaction experimentally provoke intranasal histamine allergen challenge increase rate transMEM inert gas exchange nasal oral treatment adrenergic agonist decrease rate . Four cohort 20 otherwise healthy adult identify one cohort assign four experiment . All subject x-ray Schuller projection estimate mastoid volume . The transMEM inert gas exchange rate measure repeatedly record ME pressure tympanometry subject breathes mixture 50 % N2O/ 50 % O2 , regress ME pressure time divide slope function estimate N2O drive gradient yield exchange constant . For experiment , transMEM N2O exchange rate measure twice separate visit ( active placebo ) . The four experimental condition : ( 1 ) intranasal ragweed placebo challenge ; ( 2 ) intranasal histamine placebo challenge ; ( 3 ) oral pseudoephedrine placebo ; ( 4 ) intranasal oxymetazoline placebo . Experiments 2-4 require two visit , Experiment 1 require additional visit obtain blood RAST test verify ragweed allergy . The paired exchange constant measure experiment compare significant difference use Student 's Paired test result interpret support refute possibility modulate transMEM N2O exchange rate different procedure .</detailed_description>
