	<brief_title>Comparison 2 Different Resin Based Filling Materials Posterior Teeth - Multicenter Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study compare performance composite resin Venus Pearl commercially available control composite material restoration class II-cavities . Primary endpoint study mean score patient calculate aesthetic , functional attribute biological parameter . Secondary endpoint evaluation secondary caries , plaque accumulation gingival reaction comparison primary score week 1 , month 6 , month 12 month 24 restoration . Beside , single component three category primary endpoint compare . The study execute multi-center ( Oregon Health &amp; Science University , Portland , OR , USA Medical School Hannover , Hannover , Germany ) , single-blinded randomized clinical investigation . 90 comparable cavity per study site treat ( 45 cavity material site ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients 18 year old . Study teeth interproximal ( Class II ) carious lesion exist defective class II restoration require restorative therapy premolar molar . The maximum cavity depth determine radiograph D2 ( Tyas classification ) . The teeth include study need proximal contact adjacent tooth occlusion oppose dentition . The teeth include study vital sign pulpal pathology . Patients report brush regularly without severe gingival inflammation and/or extensive caries . Patients allergy systemic disease inhibit treatment . Patients voluntary participation sign write informed consent form . Patients willing participate recall/reexamination appointment . Simultaneous participation another study dental restorative material . Written inform consent form sign . Nonvital pulp / periapical lesion . Insufficient oral hygiene despite detailed instruction . Pregnancy/ breast feed placement study restoration . Minors . Severe malocclusion/ malalignment/ traumatic occlusion/ bruxism . Known allergy component present material use study . Unclear mucosal alteration , e.g . oral lichenoid reactions/lesions . Severe medical complication ( organ transplant , cancer , immunecompromised , longterm antibiotic steroid therapy ) . Infectious disease HIV/Aids , Hepatitis , etc . Application bleach product less 14 day placement restoration . Orthodontic treatment study . Xerostomia . Untreated periodontal disease . Rampant extensive caries present . Systemic diseases potential oral manifestation . Sufficient isolation accord criterion adhesive technique possible , e.g . application rubber dam . Direct adhesive restoration indicate . Replacement one cusp indicate . Dental fear patient .</criteria>
