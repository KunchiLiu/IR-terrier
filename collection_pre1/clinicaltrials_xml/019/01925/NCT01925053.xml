	<detailed_description>This study lead Dr Alan Mackie Institute Food Research support Dr Paul Malcolm Radiology Department Norfolk Norwich University Hospital Foundation Trust ( NNUHFT ) meal prepared supervision Dr Frances Bligh Unilever Research . The recruitment participant carry Alan Mackie Institute Food Research Norwich . Four apparently healthy participant recruit onto study . Apparently healthy male participant BMI 19 35 recruit either advertisement identify Institute Food Research ( IFR ) Human Nutrition Unit ( HNU ) Volunteer Database . Preliminary telephone interview Alan Mackie , chief investigator establish inclusion/exclusion criterion potential participant respond advertisement and/or invitation letter . Potential participant invite attend interview HNU IFR meet chief investigator discus study protocol , test meal ask question study . They minimum 72 hour consider participation . They ask contact chief investigator still interested contact anyone research team time . After participant 's response , next visit arrange IFR HNU obtain write consent ( Annex 4 ) complete MRI safety questionnaire ( Annex 10 ) . The consent take Chief Investigator Senior Research Nurse . Participants consent requirement screen procedure , weight , height blood pressure assess . Enrollment contingent screen questionnaire ( Annex 5 ) simple screening ( urine dipstick ) , carry HNU research nurse . If participant decides join study , appointment make Study Test Day Radiology Department NNUHFT . On study day participant ask eat breakfast home ( 09:00 ) . The breakfast meal record ( Annex 6 ) repeat second visit . They may drink water much need 10am . They subsequently allow food drink . The study involve participant attend Radiology Department NNUHFT two separate occasion consume test meal ( allocated random ) undergo 11 MRI scan abdomen two test day . On day , initial formality , include check MRI patient safety questionnaire change surgical gown , participant undergo first MRI scan ( baseline measurement ) complete VAS questionnaire . If baseline scan show significant content result consumption food 09:00 participant reschedule . The participant ask consume meal , allocate random . The meal plat consumed appropriate room adjacent MRI facility . Immediately meal consume second MRI scan perform subsequent scan undertaken laid protocol . For measurement participant lie scanner table position beneath torsophased array surface coil place upper abdomen . A breath hold scan perform determine stomach position full imaging session . Each scan session take approximately 5 minute , scan participant sit outside scanner room . The participant ask repeatedly complete VAS satiety questionnaire . The timing predetermine give protocol . There 1 study day , similar Day 1 , carry least 7 day apart different test meal occasion ( random order ) .</detailed_description>
