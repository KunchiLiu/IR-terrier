	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose inotuzumab ozogamicin give together combination chemotherapy treat patient relapsed refractory acute leukemia . Immunotoxins , inotuzumab ozogamicin , find cancer cell express cluster differentiation ( CD ) 22 kill without harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , vincristine sulfate , prednisone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving inotuzumab ozogamicin together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1312 , Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety inotuzumab ozogamicin combination cyclophosphamide , vincristine ( vincristine sulfate ) prednisone ( CVP ) determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) inotuzumab ozogamicin regimen patient relapse refractory CD22+ acute leukemia ( B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ B-ALL ] , mixed phenotype , Burkitt 's ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate preliminary activity ( response rate : complete remission [ CR ] + complete remission incomplete count recovery [ CRi ] ) combination expansion cohort . II . To estimate frequency severity toxicity combination patient population . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study inotuzumab ozogamicin . Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , vincristine sulfate IV day 1 , prednisone orally ( PO ) day 1-5 , inotuzumab ozogamicin IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 1 year , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
