	<brief_summary>The purpose research study collect information brain function structure among active duty military personnel civilians healthy . Researchers want develop database normal volunteer use comparison similar database active duty military post-concussive syndrome ( PCS ) mild traumatic brain injury . Findings study may use design large study evaluate whether hyperbaric oxygen treatment actually improve PCS . Participants study undergo numerous test assess physical , mental , intellectual health might change time . Participants wear heart activity monitor , undergo brain imaging , provide blood urine laboratory testing , vision , hearing , balance , muscle function test . They also complete number questionnaire interview . This battery test repeat twice course 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Normative Datasets Assessments Planned Mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( NORMAL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study develop database normal healthy participant outcome use program study hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO2 ) vs. sham control participant persistent post-concussive symptom . This study characterize distribution response change response time outcomes examine association measure within give normal participant across participant characteristic age gender . It evaluate test-retest reliability series assessment anticipate use primary , secondary , exploratory outcome program study . A secondary purpose study compare normative value result randomize exploratory study HBO2 vs. sham control participant persistent post-concussive symptom . Also , investigator examine relationship outcome measure normal participant ( respect clinical equivalence , participant burden , risk ) compare association observe study . In study , normal , healthy , non-brain injured civilian military participant ( active inactive ) undergo battery outcome assessment define test interval replicate assessment battery use program study investigate safety HBO2 patient post-concussive symptom follow mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . The planned comprehensive assessment obtain robust neuropsychological , physiological , neuroimaging data . Other evaluation include laboratory testing evaluation auditory , vestibular , visual system . Neuroimaging ( magnetic resonance imaging compute tomography angiography ) assess participant baseline 6 month . Neurological function electroencephalography ( EEG ) assess baseline . All in-person outcome measure assess participant baseline , 13 week , 6 month .</detailed_description>
