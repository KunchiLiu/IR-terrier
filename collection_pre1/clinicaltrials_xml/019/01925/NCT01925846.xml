	<brief_summary>Microbial infection cornea , also know microbial keratitis , cause severe corneal inflammation could result permanent visual loss . Contact lens wear strong risk factor relate microbial keratitis develop country . The commonly isolated pathogen contact lens associate microbial keratitis ( CLMK ) Pseudomonas aeruginosa , account one third case . Among various virulence factor involve pathogenesis pseudomonal keratitis , secretion system know type three secretion system ( T3SS ) secrete toxins damage host cell . ExoS bifunctional exotoxin GTPase-activating protein ( GAP ) activity ADP ribosyl transferase ( ADPRT ) activity . It result invasive phenotype P. aeruginosa cause relatively slow host cell death intracellular invasion possibly proliferation bacterium . In contrast , ExoU express strain carry cytotoxic phenotype cause rapid host cell lysis due phospholipase activity . Previously , cytotoxic strain report commonly find patient pseudomonal keratitis highly correlate multidrug resistance . In order understand pathogenesis CLMK , especially pseudomonal related CLMK , propose recruit 180 volunteer wear different contact lens material . We collect use contact lens analyze 1 ) microbiota use contact lens ; 2 ) bacterial-contact lens adhesion wild strain , pscC mutant strain ( T3SS needle-comples mutant ) , cytotoxic strain , invasive strain P. aeruginosa ; 3 ) effect shear force bacterial-contact lens adhesion ; 4 ) bacteriocidal effect multipurpose solution different strain P. aeruginosa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subject recruitment The inclusion criterion include : 1. age 20-35 year old 2. myopia less -6.00D astigmatism less -1.50D 3. previous soft contact lens wear discontinue least 2 week . Exclusion criterion include : 1. subject previous RGP wear 2. ocular inflammation infection , prove dry eye syndrome , glaucoma , ocular trauma surgery , topical medication instillation 3. diabetic mellitus 4. pregnancy 5. status post corneal refractive surgery The aim purpose study thoroughly explain potential participant . Informed consent obtain enrolled subject . This study approve Institutional Review Board adhere tenet Declaration Helsinki . A minimal 12 subject per group require show difference microbiota one classification level significance level 0.05 power 90 % . Thus , goal recruit 15 volunteer wear type contact lens 180 subject totally study . The recruitment divide three stage . At first stage , test 4 type silicone hydrogel contact lenses , follow test 5 type color-tinted hydrogel lenses second stage 3 type hydrogel lens third stage . ( T = type lens , equal 4,5 3 stage one , two three ) . At stage , recruit subject certain amount ( M ) time ( M＝N×T , N equal 1,2,3…to 15 ) . M subject randomize , equally distribute wear T type lenses random number method . Until required case numberis achieve first stage , proceed second third stage stratify randomization method . ( required case number , ΣM , equal 60 , 75 45 stage one , two three ) . Subjects fit soft contact lens expect wear lens least 6-8 hour per day . Standardized hand hygiene lens care regimen thoroughly explain subject insert contact lens . Each subject enrol provide soft contact lenses without charge . After wear day , contact lens must return collect material analysis .</detailed_description>
