	<brief_summary>Pediatric glaucoma rare potentially blind condition pressure eye high . Diagnosis base intraocular pressure ( IOP ) assessment optic nerve , cornea structure . Accurate intraocular pressure measurement young child often impossible obtain office setting . Children need sedation general anesthesia determine IOP . All volatile general anesthetic affect IOP . Nitrous Oxide , weak volatile anesthetic , affect IOP healthy adult . Since Nitrous Oxide show safe effective variety practice environment , want evaluate use nitrous oxide oxygen obtain IOP measurement child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Measurement Intraocular Pressure Normal Children Under General Anesthesia With Without Nitrous Oxide Anesthetic Eye Drops</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator 's intention measure IOP nitrous oxide Oxygen follow measurement Sevoflurane population child without glaucoma already schedule undergo general anesthesia elective eye surgery . Normally , induction maintenance general anesthesia child include addition volatile anesthetic Sevoflurane . The investigator hypothesize child , Nitrous oxide affect IOP pre-anesthetic baseline minimally . Hence , sequential IOP measurement take short interval ( every 30 second times 3 ) , minimal change initial nitrous oxide phase induction compare subsequent addition Sevoflurane . Subject 's parent consent subject old enough understand procedure , also sign assent participation study.The child randomize either nitrous oxide oxygen Sevoflurane group Nitrous oxide oxygen alone group Sevoflurane oxygen group without Nitrous oxide inhalational anesthetic mix . Subjects pre-treated midazolam via oral administration dose 0.5 - 1 mg/kg exceed 20 mg total . If present intravenous line , pre-treated midazolam 0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg . All patient receive preoperative sedation monitor per ASA procedural sedation guideline . Once subject buy operating room , ASA mandatory vital sign monitor connect tetracaine eye drop ( fast act topical anesthetic solution ) place subject 's right eye . The rapid clearance short act topical anesthetic reduces potential risk systemic toxicity . Once drops , inhalation induction begin initial attempt measure IOP begin pediatric anesthesiologist deem patient ready clinically.all vital sign IOP Measurements repeat every 30 second three time record data analysis . Once measurement record , case proceed schedule plan .</detailed_description>
