	<brief_summary>- Hypothesis : Focal Impulse Rotor Modulation ( FIRM ) substantially reduce eliminate clinical atrial fibrillation subject accept indication catheter ablation paroxysmal AF , compare standard pulmonary vein isolation . - Summary : This prospective randomized study assess safety effectiveness FIRM procedure , versus standard Pulmonary Vein Isolation ( PVI ) procedures treatment symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
