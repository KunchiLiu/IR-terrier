	<brief_title>Individualized Dietetic Intervention-eating Habits Obese Hispanic Children Low Socioeconomic Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Population An open invitation make child eight public school low socioeconomic status ( low SES ) , representative geographical area Monterrey , second large city México . From accept , child randomly select screen overweight/obesity use BMI percentile , qualify overweight/obesity invite participate dietetic intervention program . Clinical Evaluation Based World Health Organization American Academy Pediatrics criterion ( BA , Spear , et al. , 2007 ) , overweight consider BMI &gt; 85th &lt; 95th percentile obesity &gt; 95th percentile accord age sex . Anthropometric measurement perform participant school . Standing height determine near 0.5 cm ( portable Seca® stadiometer , North America ) weight near 0.1 kg child wear light clothing , sock shoe ( TANITA TBF 300® scale , Arlington , Illinois ) . Waist circumference measure near 0.1 cm level umbilicus flexible fiberglass tape subject stand , gently exhale , clothe area . BMI calculate weight ( kg ) divide square height ( ) . Measurements perform three train register dietitian ( RD ) child control inter-observer variability . Dietetic Intervention The principal strategy change energy food group consumption , dietary modification child parental support , recommend national association ( SR , Daniels et al , 2009 ; TA , Nicklas , et al , 2008 ; BA , Spear , et al. , 2007 , A Report Panel Macronutrients et al , 2005 ) . Dietetic intervention give individually RD every child school , every three week , total 13 visit school-year . Children leave classroom attend 30-minute nutrition counseling . Each child see RD throughout school-year favor compliance plan avoid inter-examiner bias . Each session consist : 1 . ) Anthropometric assessment ; 2 . ) Dietetic assessment mean 24-hour diet recall , standardize food frequency questionnaire include Mexican food , food replica aid estimation portion size ; 3 . ) Individualized energy restriction balance macronutrient dietary planning ; 4 . ) Provision structure , tailored-made daily menu meal next three week child ; 5 . ) Information give parents/care giver healthy food , eat practice portion size . Attendance parent/care giver mandatory help answer 24-hour recall assure commitment follow dietary recommendation home . After visit , RD record information software ( NutriKcal®VO software , Consinfo S.C. , D.F. , Mexico . ) , determine energy intake diet composition . Diet composition ( macronutrients ) base recent dietary recommend intake child ( A Report Panel Macronutrients et al , 2005 ) : 25 % -35 % total calorie fat ; 45 % -65 % carbohydrates 10 % -30 % protein . Additional recommendation child adolescent include variety food low saturate fat ( &lt; 10 % kcal ) , trans fat cholesterol &lt; 300 mg/day . The RDs promote age appropriate serving size , include approximately &gt; 5 serving fruit vegetable , &gt; 3 serving low fat milk dairy product , &gt; 6 serving whole-grain product per day ; increase dietary fiber reduction salt intake ( US Department Agriculture US Department Health Human Services , 2010 ) . As well , child advise avoid overconsumption energy dense , nutrient-poor food beverage ( TA , Nicklas et al , 2008 ) . Reduction calorie intake approached follow recommendation American Heart Association child &gt; 4 year old BMI &gt; 85th percentile achieve BMI percentile reduction &lt; 85th percentile weight maintenance linear growth ( SR , Daniels , et al , 2009 ) . As advised ( BA , Spear , et al , 2007 ) , progressive restriction 150-900 calorie actual intake throughout school year recommend obese child BMI &gt; 95th percentile lose gradually 0.5 kilogram/month BMI &gt; 99th percentile lose maximum 0.9 kilogram/week . Statistical Methods MINITAB version 16 ( Minitab Inc. , State College , Pennsylvania , USA ) use analyze difference anthropometric parameter nutrient intake value baseline end intervention ; Microsoft Excel 2007 ( Microsoft Corp. , Redmond , Washington , USA ) use incorporate input data . The result express mean ± standard deviation ( s.d . ) correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . Comparisons group dependent variable make use paired Student 's t-test mean . The mean comparison gender group determine use t-test independent sample . All test interpret base two-tailed hypothesis . The significance level set 0.05 case .</detailed_description>
