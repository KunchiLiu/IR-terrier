	<brief_summary>Each year , 450,000 Canadian woman become pregnant , result participation prenatal screen Down syndrome , approximately 10,000 amniocentesis ( i.e . sample liquid surround fetus ) , 315 find carry baby Down syndrome 70 normal pregnancy lose complication procedure . It discover recently , pregnancy , fetal DNA maternal blood sufficient quantity analyse method propose detect presence fetus Down syndrome use maternal blood . The introduction genomic blood test propose context project could lead increase detection Down syndrome , less invasive screening 9700 amniocentesis avoid year Canada , improve peace mind pregnant woman , prevent accidental loss 70 normal fetus , low overall cost current practice . However , method still need validate appropriately introduced routine care . The study hypothesis new genomics-based non-invasive method use fetal-DNA maternal blood pregnancy effective current prenatal screening method fetal aneuploidy . This project carry independent study validate performance utility different new genomic technology screen pregnant woman use maternal blood . The team researcher compare real-life performance different non-invasive assay strategy screen fetal aneuploidy , identify evidence-based cost-effective approach implementation new technology Canadian health care system . The deliverable project enable decision maker , pregnant woman partner make inform choice pertain prenatal genetic screening diagnosis , screen Down syndrome , reduce risk pregnancy associate amniocentesis .</brief_summary>
