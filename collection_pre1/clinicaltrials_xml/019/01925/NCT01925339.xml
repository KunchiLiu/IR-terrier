	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two different timing restore dental implant place right tooth extraction : The test group provisional crown place time implant placement . The control group tooth remove implant place appointment restoration place 4 month . Both procedure currently accept method replace miss teeth direct comparison two procedure lack . The result study aid clinician select best time restore implant patient . The hypothesis immediate restoration might increase aesthetic outcome , e.g . le mucosal recession .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esthetic Outcomes Immediately Placed Implants Receiving Immediate Provisionalization Delayed Restoration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single center , randomize control , parallel-arm study plan investigate esthetic outcome immediate placement restoration esthetic zone . Forty adult patient hopeless maxillary anterior premolar tooth , intact adjacent teeth enrol . A signed write informed consent obtain give verbal write information describe nature duration study . Subjects screen treat informed consent obtain . Patient information protect accord privacy regulation Federal Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act 1996 ( HIPAA ) . The enrolled patient randomly place one two treatment group , immediate implant placement ( IIP ) restoration group ( IR ) IIP + delay restoration group ( DR ) . For patient , hopeless tooth extract atraumatically implant place immediately . The decision make randomly either restore implant immediately ( Test group ) provisional crown restore implant 4 month implant placement ( Control group ) . Outcome analyse perform approximately 1-year implant surgery primarily evaluate clinical radiographic parameter determine esthetic outcome immediately restore IIP implant , comparison immediately place restored delayed approach .</detailed_description>
