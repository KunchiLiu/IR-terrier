	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Apremilast Treat Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3b , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study evaluate efficacy safety apremilast monotherapy subject active psoriatic arthritis . Approximately 214 subject randomize 1:1 ratio either apremilast 30 mg BID ( twice day ) identically-appearing placebo , approximately 107 subject per treatment group . This 113-week study . The subject spend 24 week double-blind , placebo-controlled treatment phase , follow 28 week active treatment phase ( ie , Week 52 visit ) . The original treatment assignment ( apremilast 30 mg BID ( twice day ) placebo ) remain blinded subject complete Week 52 visit ( discontinue ) . After Week 52 visit , subject extension phase continue receive treatment apremilast 30 mg BID ( twice day ) end study ( ie , Week 104 visit ) early discontinuation trial . The study consist 5 phase : 1 . Screening Phase - 5 week 2 . Randomized , Placebo-controlled , Double Blind Treatment Phase - Weeks 0 24 3 . Active Treatment Phase - Week 24 Week 52 4 . Open-label Extension Phase - Week 52 Week 104 5 . Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase</detailed_description>
