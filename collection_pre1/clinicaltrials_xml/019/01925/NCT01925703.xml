	<brief_title>Short-Term Effects &amp; Safety Accelerated Intravenous Iron Regimen Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot investigation evaluate short-term hematologic effect safety accelerate intravenous iron regimen patient heart failure iron deficiency . Recent investigation demonstrate improved clinical outcome use intravenous iron therapy patient population , weekly regimen administer ambulatory patient may inconvenient , impractical , associate less optimal adherence rate many patient , especially reduce functional capacity . The heart failure population characterize frequent hospitalization , would make accelerated inpatient regimen convenient attractive option improve heart failure symptom , exercise tolerance , quality life . Accelerated regimen demonstrate safe effective patient population , study date evaluate strategy hospitalize patient heart failure .</detailed_description>
