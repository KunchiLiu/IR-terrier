	<brief_summary>Sickle Cell disease cause inherited hemoglobin disorder . Healthy red blood cell discoid deform move small blood vessel carry oxygen part body . In Sickle Cell disease , red blood cell circulate oxygen release , deoxygenate abnormal Hemoglobin S begin polymerize cause red cell become sticky elongated . These `` sickled '' red cell less flexible obstruct small blood vessel prevent normal red cell circulate freely , limit oxygen delivery tissue organ . This know `` sickling crisis '' `` vaso-occlusive crisis '' lead cause hospitalization patient Sickle Cell disease . Patients suffer sickle crisis experience severe pain risk stroke , heart attack even death . Current therapy limit hydration symptomatic pain relief . The administration MP4CO adjunct treatment standard therapy may alleviate pain associate sickling crisis potentially reduce severity duration crisis . This may shorten time hospital potentially improve quality life patient sickle cell anemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study MP4CO Treat Vaso-occlusive Sickle Crisis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) autosomal recessive disorder β globin gene hemoglobin molecule . To date , specific agent approve treat sickle cell crisis , reduce severity sickling crisis , shorten duration admission . Current therapy crisis limit hydration symptomatic pain relief opiates pain severe enough cause admission hospital . Administration oxygen inhalation alone proven effective . The carbon monoxide ( CO ) molecule bind Hb S , attach , prevents reverse polymerization Hb S chain distortion red cell . CO low dos also act cell-signaling molecule , may reduce inflammation , decrease oxygen requirement , prevent program cell death ( apoptosis ) . MP4CO design ischemic rescue therapy deliver non-toxic level CO , provide immediate metabolic signal cell help reverse red cell sickling , reduce inflammation . Previously publish study provide foundation postulate MP4CO might appropriate property treatment reversal acute sickling crisis . The initial release CO MP4CO predict beneficial effect include immediate stabilization Hb S prevent red cell polymerization reverse exist sickling , dilation capillary enhance tissue perfusion , anti-inflammatory cell-signalling property . The subsequent circulation MP4 molecule oxygen therapeutic ( convert MP4OX follow oxygenation lung ) help 1 ) preferentially oxygenate ischemic tissue , 2 ) reverse partially sickled red cell , 3 ) improve perfusion oxygenation local tissue potentially ameliorate painful crisis cause sickling red cell . In addition , MP4CO enhance chemical stability , enable storage room temperature .</detailed_description>
