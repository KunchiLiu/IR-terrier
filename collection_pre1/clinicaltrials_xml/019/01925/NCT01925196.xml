	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people mutation C9ORF72 gene cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) . The mutation cause small piece DNA repeat thousand time . The C9ORF gene mutation mostly occur family . In family , person ALS others FTD . Occasionally C9ORF gene mutation occur person without family history . Researchers want understand gene cause different disease . They study symptom cause C9ORF gene develop change time . They measure symptom occur ALS FTD . In particular , measure strength , ability move , thinking , memory . They also see test associate progression disease . These test , call biomarkers , may help detect measure C9ORF72 disease future . Objectives : - To understand symptom change time people mutation gene call C9ORF72 , cause ALS FTD . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 genetic mutation Design : - Participants 4 in-person visit 3 telephone interview 3 year . Each in-person visit may take place several day . They may either inpatient outpatient visit . - At visit , participant undergo series brain , language , behavior test . These include : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain . This use magnet , radio wave , computer produce detailed picture brain . - Collecting spinal fluid . The clinician make participant back numb insert needle collect fluid . &lt; TAB &gt; - Blood sample take . &lt; TAB &gt; - Participants ask perform several language movement test . &lt; TAB &gt; - Small skin sample take one visit - Between visit , participant answer question health phone 3 time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Biomarkers Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Frontotemporal Dementia Caused C9ORF72 Gene Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective The primary objective study characterize natural history disease patient carry repeat expansion C9ORF72 gene , cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) . The secondary objective ass whether candidate biomarkers correlate disease progression . Study population 62 person document repeat expansion C9ORF72 gene ALS , ALS-FTD , FTD carrier gene mutation symptomatic family member . Design Participants undergo structure battery clinical neuropsychological test enrollment three follow-up visit NIH assess disease severity . During visit , physiological , image , blood , CSF test candidate biomarkers obtain . Between visit NIH , assessments functional status cognition carry phone . Participants may see early schedule follow-up visit home phone assessment indicate clinical deterioration . Outcome measure There three primary outcome measure , change three area function first six month . The primary measure severity motor clinical function ALS Functional rating scale-revised ( ALSFRS-R ) . The primary measure severity cognitive function change verbal fluency score . The primary measure severity behavioral dysfunction caregiver assessment fronto-behavioral index ( FBI ) . Secondary clinical outcome force vital capacity ( FVC ) survival . The correlation primary secondary clinical outcome measure candidate biomarkers measure analyze exploratory fashion determine whether candidate biomarkers predictive disease onset progression .</detailed_description>
