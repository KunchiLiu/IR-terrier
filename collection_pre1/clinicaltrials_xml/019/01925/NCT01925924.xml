	<brief_summary>Demineralization orthodontic ( brace ) treatment common clinical problem lead unsightly white brown mark teeth . A recent systematic review show little evidence current method deliver fluoride effective reduce problem . Design : A multi-centre randomise single blind controlled clinical trial conduct two parallel group . Setting : The trial patient treat eight name operator Specialist List Orthodontics hold General Dental Council work either within hospital service specialist orthodontic practice . The sample size calculation suggest operator need treat 40 patient trial ( approx 1 session per week ) plus 10 familiarisation patient . Planned trial intervention : Brackets bond teeth front first permanent molar either resin-modified glass ionomer cement ( Fuji Ortho LC ) light cure composite control ( Transbond ) . The material bond allocated randomly . Outcome measure : The two main outcome measure difference demineralization anterior teeth treatment assess photographs number debonded bracket treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Demineralization ( dental decay ) around fix appliance component report occur 95 % case bracket bond composite resin . Although early lesion appear clinically opaque white brown area , mineral loss continue cavitation occur . Following appliance removal , lesion may regress disappear may still present aesthetic problem 5 year appliance removal . Fluoride known inhibit lesion development enhance remineralization follow treatment . Resin-modified glass ionomer cement , release absorb fluoride , may use bracket bond thereby offer possibility less demineralization around bond attachment . In addition , cement appear behave reliably composite term bracket failure rate record data case series rather optimally design randomised clinical trial . A bonding agent behave reliably composite minimize unwanted enamel demineralization would optimal ; save restorative cost may require cavitation occur . From patient perspective , subjective assessment treatment outcome likely enhance ugly demineralise enamel white lesion eliminate .</detailed_description>
