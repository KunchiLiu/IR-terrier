	<brief_summary>This pilot study assess safety immunogenicity pentavalent rotavirus vaccine ( RV5 ) administer accord alternate dosing schedule ( 2-5 week , 2 month 4 month ) . In interventional , open-label study , infants 2 5 week age ( 14 41 day ) enrol vaccinated RV5 accord 2-5 week , 2 4 month schedule infant 2 month age ( 56 83 day ) vaccinate accord standard recommend schedule ( 2 , 4 , 6 month age ) . Sera obtain subject one month follow final dose vaccine assay anti-rotavirus IgA rotavirus neutralize antibody response G1 , G2 , G3 , G4 P [ 8 ] serotypes . Post dose 3 G1 serum-neutralizing antibody ( SNA ) geometric mean titer ( GMTs ) compare child receive pentavalent rotavirus vaccine ( RV5 ) accord alternate dosing schedule versus standard recommend schedule . Likewise , post dose 3 G2 , G3 , G4 P [ 8 ] SNA serum rotavirus IgA GMTs compare child receive RV5 accord alternate dosing schedule standard recommend schedule . The safety tolerability RV5 child receive vaccine accord alternate dosing schedule describe .</brief_summary>
