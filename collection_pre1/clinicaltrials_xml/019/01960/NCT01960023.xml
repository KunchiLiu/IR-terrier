	<brief_summary>The FC-7 study design open label , single arm , Phase I/II dose-escalation study evaluate combination neratinib cetuximab patient metastatic colorectal cancer primary tumor `` quadruple wild-type `` ( wild-type KRAS , NRAS , BRAF , PIK3CA ) . The primary aim Phase I portion study determine safety tolerability two-drug combination . The primary aim Phase II part determine overall objective response rate ( complete partial response ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) . Patients receive concurrent therapy cetuximab ( 400 mg/m2 IV load dose follow 250 mg/m2 IV weekly ) , neratinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Neratinib Cetuximab Treat Patients With Quadruple Wild-Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The neratinib dose-escalation use 3+3 design include 4 dose level ( 120 mg , 160 mg , 200 mg , 240 mg ) daily oral dose . Up 12 patient treated maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The neratinib dose-escalation study proceed basis dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) cycle 1 . DLT define occurrence 1 follow event cycle 1 : grade diarrhea associate fever dehydration require IV fluid ; grade 3 diarrhea last 2 day optimal medical therapy ; grade 4 diarrhea duration ; grade 3 4 neutropenia associate fever ; grade 4 neutropenia last 7 day ; grade 4 thrombocytopenia ; grade 3 4 non-hematological toxicity ( exclude grade 3 rash allergic reaction/hypersensitivity ) ; toxicity-related delay 2 week initiate cycle 2 . Patients enrol next dose level evaluable patient dose level complete first treatment cycle . Enrolled patient remain assigned dose level treatment toxicity disease progression . The Phase II part study proceed two-stage design maximum 46 patient . Between 6 12 patient Phase I MTD level include Phase II , stage-one analysis . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 . Submission tumor blood sample FC-7 correlative science study study requirement patient . A core biopsy procedure procure fresh tumor sample accessible site metastasis perform study dose level assignment ( patient sign consent form screen eligibility ) . Optional biopsy sample metastatic disease procure consent patient Cycle 1 treatment time disease progression .</detailed_description>
