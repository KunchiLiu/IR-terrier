	<brief_summary>Liver transplantation last surgical treatment patient acute chronic liver disease . Transplantation therapy technics constant evolution . It allow increase survival rate time come back daily activity . The postoperative treatment abdominal surgery Liver Transplantation ( LT ) usually perform Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) .This postoperative phase one important step regard involvement rehabilitation patient ( Rongies 2005 ) . Physical ability transplantation likely important postoperative . It appear pre-transplant subject weaken muscle potential , increase significantly month transplantation rehabilitation program adapt ( Beyer 1999 ) . Length stay ICU depend surgery complication . Inactivity induce sedation ICU length stay major factor increase complication respiratory disorder muscle weakness . Several study report feasibility safety early mobility program ICU , especially regard length stay decrease ( Bailey 2007 ; Morris 2008 ; Schweickret 2009 , Needham 2010 ; Bourdin 2010 ) These early mobility program encompass muscle strength assessment , passive range motion , active mobility , sit edge bed , stand walking , would relate primary disease LT ( Rongies 2008 ) . The assessment strength ICU patient feasible reproducible Medical Research Council score ( MRC score ) . The MRC score consist assessment three muscle group upper low limb . Sitting position verticalization include program begin soon possible surgery evaluation response level verbal stimulation physical ability ( Gosselink 2011 ) . The skill physiotherapist establish legal text make key assessment management patient musculoskeletal respiratory domain . The purpose study validate data feasibility tolerance . Another aim also assess length stay ICU , early mobility physical program , start postoperative period population patient liver transplantation , stay ICU Prof. Albanese . Thus , decide carry parallel study , open , randomized monocentric compare two group patient liver transplant . The control group receive standard treatment use ICU experimental group receive protocol early mobilization accord data recent literature subject . The study schedule last one year include patient receive physical therapy five day week frequency one several time per day depend clinical requirement condition study .</brief_summary>
