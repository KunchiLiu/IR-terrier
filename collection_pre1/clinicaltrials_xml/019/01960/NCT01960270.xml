	<brief_summary>Unilateral sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) emerge valuable treatment patient low urinary tract dysfunction failure bad tolerance anticholinergic treatment overactive bladder . However , medium long term , patient fail benefit unilateral stimulation ( unilateral neuromodulation ) . A contralateral stimulation could test implanted restore efficacy . An option perform bilateral stimulation sacral nerve could lead summation effect well unilateral stimulation . Therefore , unilateral sacral nerve stimulation fail , contralateral bilateral test consider .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Secondary Bilateral Sacral Nerve Stimulation Overactive Bladder Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) treatment non neurogenic ( idiopathic ) patient overactivity bladder ( OAB ) symptom , refractory conservative treatment . After selection patient positive stimulation test ( PNE test ) , success rate stimulation implant approximatively 70 % ( 40 80 % ) . Unilateral versus bilateral initial implantation retrospectively compare Pham et al . respectively 58 77 % success rate . Wound infection complication rate similar . However limitation bilateral stimulation increase cost health care system , augment duration procedure , possible morbidity . Therefore initial implantation first step treatment unilateral current practice . However , period time , secondary failure may happen , either complete failure return initial symptom partial failure decrease efficacy may impact quality life . However , non clinical evident effect could summation effect contralateral stimulator implant , possibly well contralateral alone . Research show small study 15 patient select group patient appear benefit bilateral stimulation test ( PNE test ) failure unilateral S3 stimulation . A successful response observe 4/11 ( 36 % ) OAB patient . Bilateral stimulation induce high clinical response stimulation controlateral lead alone void parameter . In patient show successful response PNE test , 3 implant bilaterally 50 % improvement 2 one year follow-up , 41 % improvement third . No painful stimulation side effect report chronic bilateral stimulation . In one study , lead migration suspect 3/15 patient cause failure . Therefore propose study use systematically tin lead electrode avoid lead migration . According preliminary data , test stimulation contralateral lead might consider secondary unsuccessful patient evaluate . Further investigation necessary determine large cohort result contralateral alone bilateral stimulator implantation . There establish guideline secondary unsuccessful patient , therefore contralateral stimulation use clinical practice accord patient practitioner opinion . This protocol present standard clinical practice evaluation .</detailed_description>
