	<criteria>Age great 18 year upper limit age Body weight &gt; 40 kg Patients isolate ASD PFO determine suitable closure via commercially available device In ASD patient , echocardiographic evidence right ventricular overload , stretch diameter defect 25 mm In patient PFO , echocardiographic evidence right leave shunt , intraatrial tunnel length 4 mm Signed informed consent , respectively ability give write informed consent tell potential benefit risk enter trial For female patient child bear capacity : Exclusion pregnancy start study willingness use adequate contraceptive method prevent pregnancy study ASD/PFO large stretch diameter 25 mm , defect unsuitable percutaneous closure Intraatrial tunnel longer 4 mm Multiple fenestrated ASD , ostium primum sinus venosus atrial septal defect , coronary sinus defect Any significant cardiac valve dysfunction Anomalous pulmonary vein Defects inadequate margin , consistent current standard care , device position appropriately avoid interference cardiac structure , subject device increase risk embolization post deployment . Acquired pathological congenital deficiency cardiovascular system ( ASD ; e.g . transposition vessel , calcification , myocardial infarction , intracardiac thrombus ) , clinically significant , respectively interfere investigator 's opinion conduct study Clinically significant dilate cardiomyopathy ( paroxysmal cause e.g . myocarditis reason ) Any patient know extensive complex congenital cardiac anomaly adequately repair way cardiac surgery Echocardiographic evidence thrombus leave atrium , leave atrial appendage , cardiac chamber , inferior vena cava . Patients within one month prior implantation know sepsis systemic infection successfully treat prior device placement Active endocarditis infection produce bacteremia . Clinically relevant arrhythmia Patients whose vasculature , access defect gain , inadequate accommodate size device , position control introduction sheath Documented history bleeding , clot coagulation disorder , untreated ulcer contraindication acetylsalicylic acid therapy , unless another antiplatelet agent administer 6 month Known hypercoagulable state Anamnesis respectively diagnosis pregnancy , breastfeed patient Any disorder investigator 's opinion could interfere compliance safety evaluation well severe concurrent illness would limit life expectancy ( e.g . malignancy ) Participation investigational drug device trial within 30 day prior selection ( day 0 ) current inclusion clinical trial research project Subjects , opinion investigator , inappropriate inclusion clinical trial comply requirement study Patients keep lawfully institution Clinical investigation shall conduct vulnerable population carry nonvulnerable population shall follow additional ethic committee procedure applicable . These clinical investigation shall design specifically address health problem occur vulnerable population , offer possibility direct healthrelated benefit vulnerable population</criteria>
