	<detailed_description>The objective work verify efficiency motor training associate visual auditory cue balance , postural anticipatory compensatory adjustment patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) , prevent fall rate people PD . It double blind , randomize clinical trial perform Center Research course Speech Therapy , Physical Therapy Occupational Therapy São Paulo University . Forty two patient idiopathic PD take part study , stag 2 3 Hoehn Yahr Classification ( HY ) . They randomly assign one 3 group : one group receive motor training associate external cue ( ET ) , one group perform motor training ( MT ) third group receive treatment generalize orientation . Performance gait balance assessement 10 training session ( two 45-minute session per week ) ET MT group , 5 week CG , use BERG test ( BT ) , Postural Stress Test ( PST ) , Time Up Go ( TUG ) . Patients also assessment independence daily life activity motor performance use section II III Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) ; Quality Life use Parkinson 's Disease Quality Life ( PDQL ) , emotional state Beck 's Depression Inventory ( BDI ) . The training consist : experimental group receive motor program balance associate rhythmical auditory cue . The direction train I. self-perception ( strategy - Verbal visual guidance ) ; II . motor performance ( Speed variation , Range motion , Trunk mobility , Turning , balance exercices ) ; III . Attention Strategies ( Division attention guidance , environment movement , Maintenance attention set ) ; IV . Cues . The training program consist 5 week 45 minute duration , divide 05 minute warm-up , 30 minute main part , 10 minute cool . The control group ( CG ) n't train receive orientation . Each session consist 05 minute Warm-Up include : Muscle stretching , joint movement , upper low global , movement slowly use wide joint movement range , turn . The Main Part include : Head movement ( bending , rotation , lean sideways ) , Axial proximal movement , coordinate movement Upper Lower range speed , Functional reach , weight shift , stationary walk gait rhythmic speed variation , postural reaction , trunk rotation , Balance exercise . And last part Cool Down , include : Slow walk , breathe exercise associate Upper limb movement global muscular relaxation stretch . During study n't change patient 's usual medicine . The subject reassessment 4 30 week without program training .</detailed_description>
