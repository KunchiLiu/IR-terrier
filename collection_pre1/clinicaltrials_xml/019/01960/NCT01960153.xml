	<brief_title>Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibition With Tadalafil Changes Outcomes Heart Failure : Extent Renal Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) -funded parent study ( PITCH-HF ) first well-controlled , randomize , large-scale trial study effect tadalafil , FDA-approved selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor ( PDE5i ) , cardiovascular heart failure-related death hospitalization patient heart failure secondary pulmonary hypertension . Both chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , reflect albuminuria reduce estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) acute kidney injury ( AKI ) significantly contribute morbidity mortality population patient enrol PITCH-HF . Therapies alter course renal disease patient heart failure lack . The biology treatment PDE5i strongly suggest potential protective effect agent renal function . This ancillary PITCH-ER study leverage PITCH-HF infrastructure randomization , add longitudinal collection subject ' urine sample 5 timepoints throughout study . With urine sample collect , PITCH-ER address 2 major patient-oriented question : 1 . Does chronic tadalafil treatment slow rate GFR decline and/or modify development/progression albuminuria v placebo ? To answer question , longitudinal measure eGFR utilize state-of-the-art equation incorporate serum creatinine cystatin C spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ( UACR ) measure . 2 . Does PDE5i treatment reduce AKI frequency and/or magnitude urinary biomarker change reflect subclinical renal injury v placebo ? An AKI adjudication committee monitor incidence AKI event severity use Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) consensus criterion . Subclinical renal injury detect use validated urinary biomarkers : neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) kidney injury marker 1 ( KIM-1 ) . Since 30 % overall PITCH-HF population likely diabetes ( amplifies risk renal injury HF patient ) , PITCH-ER repeat analysis population stratify baseline diabetes status secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
