	<brief_summary>Catheter associate blood stream infection ( CA-BSI ) remain source significant morbidity mortality adult pediatric critical care unit . While establish CVL maintenance bundle pivotal achieve maintain low CA-BSI rate , train retention proper bundle compliance remain challenge . The investigator prospectively compare simulation-based program standard educational approach . The investigator hypothesize implementation bedside simulation-based training CVL dressing change register nurse would improve CVL maintenance bundle compliance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simulation-Based Central Venous Line Maintenance Bundle Education</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 2006 NACHRI Quality Transformation Effort demonstrate additional reduction pediatric catheter associate blood stream infection ( CA-BSI ) rate could achieve improve compliance maintenance bundle care central line . The investigator objective improve maintenance bundle compliance rate nurse competency surround central venous line ( CVL ) care pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) . A multidisciplinary team develop bedside simulation-based training program improve compliance standard PICU CVL maintenance bundle . The investigator perform randomized comparison study compare standard CVL bundle education process bedside PICU nurse control group ( CG ) intervention group ( IG ) receive bedside training simulate CVL dress change maintenance bundle follow intermittent educational refresh . Groups assess compliance prescribed component CVL bundle maintenance ( CVL score ) . CVL score compare group</detailed_description>
