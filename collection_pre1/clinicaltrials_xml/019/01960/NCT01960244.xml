	<detailed_description>The FH Foundation CASCADE-FH Registry implement enrollment framework characterize three possible point contact : 1 ) Clinic enrollment 2 ) Self-enrollment online patient portal , 3 ) Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) identification . Pathway 1 : Clinic-Based Screening Enrollment During initial study phase , number specialize lipid clinic across US participate CASCADE-FH registry . FH patient sit meet inclusion enroll . Each site require receive IRB approval obtain patient consent . Once initial set specialize lipid clinic demonstrate acceptable feasibility patient enrollment engagement , additional site recruit registry . Pathway 2 : Patient Self-Enrollment Potential registry participant opportunity self-enroll CASCADE-FH Registry online screen mechanism . A link FH Foundation website ( http : //www.thefhfoundation.org ) direct potential participant brief screening questionnaire see inclusion criterion . Pathway 3 : Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) Screening System-wide search EHR identify potential FH patient base LDL lab value clinical FH criterion . Following identification , primary care provider potential FH patient send notification letter describe patient 's high LDL level , at-risk status need additional screening . The patient may undergo additional clinical genetic testing provide information CASCADE-FH registry participation . Data collection For data enter clinical site , primary source information patient 's medical record . Baseline data element abstract enter . Data element enter self-enrolled patient online patient portal include subset clinical information well question quality life , disease-related anxiety , depression . A short survey assess patient understand FH health risk , available treatment option , family member screening also include . The patient questionnaire design free clinical jargon pilot-tested FH patient volunteer ensure ease use participant . Followup data collection For patient enrolled clinical site , provider ask update information yearly interval . Medical record review assess change medication , occurrence major adverse cardiovascular event , hospitalization , genetic testing , laboratory value update since last date data entry . Follow-up data collect yearly 3 year follow initial enrollment . Self-enrolled patient may update data time access patient portal . Updated information current medication regimen , clinical event , quality life collect . However , reminder email send self-enrolled patient annual basis ensure uniform entry follow information . Patient-Reported Data Validation To ensure collection high-quality data FH patient-reported outcome , annual validation proportion self-enrolled patient record conduct assess concordance information enter online patient portal data medical record . Following baseline data entry , self-enrolled patient ask provide contact information physician sign medical release validation patient report data . Of patient sign medical release , randomly generate 10 % sample select validation yearly basis . Patient response question regard medication regimen , comorbid condition , clinical event lab result compare determine concordance patient- physician-reported data . Overall agreement , sensitivity , specificity , kappa statistic evaluated determine concordance response . Based prior validation analyse patient-reported data , expect moderate good agreement two data source ( Îš=0.40-0.80 ) 19,20 Data element low rate concordance assessed clarity may refine enhance sensitivity specificity . Supplemental educational material may provide variable low concordance promote valid data capture . Longitudinal Outcomes Serial lipid value key outcome interest examine assess adequacy lipid modify therapy achieve target LDL value . Longitudinal outcomes interest include medication change , occurrence major adverse cardiovascular event , mortality . Primary patient-reported outcome interest include notification screen family member , treatment satisfaction , disease-related perception , quality life measurement . Statistical Considerations The CASCADE-FH Registry collect patient-reported clinician-reported information characterize treatment pattern outcomes among FH patient . Because study not-hypothesis driven specific medical therapy treatment intervention compare , formal prospective calculation sample sizes necessary . However , periodically assess variation lipid management , clinical event , patient-reported outcome evaluate temporal change variable . Standard statistical approach commonly use observational analysis utilized . Data Feedback Quality Improvement Sites participate CASCADE-FH Registry receive annual data feedback report highlight treatment pattern , serial lipid value , clinical outcome enrol patient compare national result . These report design facilitate quality improvement intervention participate site design improve treatment outcome FH patient . Self-enrolled patient opportunity download report data directly well pre-programmed self-feedback , electronic report access time .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Online Patient Enrollment Patients exist clinical diagnosis FH ; Patients genetic mutation FH ; Patients initial ( pretreatment ) LDL level &gt; 190 mg/dL total cholesterol &gt; 300 mg/dL ; Patients currently take lipidlowering medication LDL &gt; 124 mg/dL total cholesterol &gt; 195 mg/dL . Clinic Patient Enrollment Patients exist clinical diagnosis FH use one three clinical diagnostic ( US MedPed Program Criteria , Simon Broome Register Criteria diagnosis `` Probable '' , Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Diagnostic Criteria diagnosis `` Probable '' ) tool FH ; Patients genetic mutation FH Patients exclude participation registry know medical condition FH think contribute hyperlipidemia ( i.e. , untreated hypothyroidism , nephrotic syndrome , cholestasis hypopituitarism ) .</criteria>
