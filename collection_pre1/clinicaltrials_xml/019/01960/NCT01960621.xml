	<criteria>Healthy non−smoking participant ( exclude smoking participant light great potential cough present result smoke habit may unduly sensitive inhaled cough stimulus , inhale capsaicin cough challenge ) Age 18−65 year No history respiratory disease Normal baseline spirometry predict age , sex height ( exclude abnormal spirometry , aim induce cough otherwise healthy volunteer participant . Also , abnormal spirometry presence respiratory symptom − may indicate underlie lung condition need attention , participant tell result consent , information forward General Practitioner , part safety well−being research participant ) . No history allergic disease i.e. , negative skin prick test ( exclude allergic disease may heighten sensitivity inhale cough stimulus , inhale capsaicin cough challenge ) Participants free significant cardiac , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , haematological , neurological psychiatric disease Not take regular medication , oral contraceptive pill ( want interaction medication participant may take i.e . hope measure cough 'tussive ' response healthy volunteer solely result effect compound investigation , 2HPBCD ) All participant must minimum gap one−month completion previous study , commencement current study History respiratory disease ( excluded respiratory disease outcome , attenuation induce capsaicin cough response intravenous 2HPBCD , unaffected respiratory disease status participant ) History upper respiratory tract infection respiratory symptom precede six week ( respiratory tract infection may cause cough highly sensitize respiratory airway inhale cough stimulus , inhale capsaicin cough challenge i.e . induced cough capsaicin challenge true reflection cough healthy volunteer participant ) Evidence positive pregnancy test ( urine beta−human chorionic gonadotrophin level ) female volunteer female participant pregnant lactate likely become pregnant trial . Women childbearing potential may include study , opinion investigator , take adequate contraceptive precaution Gastrointestinal symptom recent alteration bowel habit new bowel symtpoms include participant know suspected history lactose intolerance ( 2HPBCD give oral tablet chronic dosing , show sometimes cause flatulence , diarrhea , soft stool abdominal cramp ) Participants susceptible renal impairment medical history ( symptoms renal failure , medical condition predispose renal impairment diabetes , history recurrent urinary infection either adult childhood , history peripheral vascular disease/stroke/coronary heart disease/hypercholestrolaemia/hyperlipidaemia ) , medical examination ( kidney size , renal bruits , peripheral upper low limb arterial pulse ) urine analysis urine 'dipstick ' ( glucose , protein , blood ) .
