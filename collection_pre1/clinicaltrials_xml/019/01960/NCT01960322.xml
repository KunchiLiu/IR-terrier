By apply threshold , marker identifies nonadherent patient . A consortium transplant center currently test marker MALT ( Medication Adherence child Liver Transplant ) study . MALT investigator propose take advantage exist collaboration pilot-test intervention improve adherence patient identify marker .</detailed_description>
