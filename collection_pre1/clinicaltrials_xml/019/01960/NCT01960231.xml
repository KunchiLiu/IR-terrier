	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus patient exhibit many glucose homeostasis abnormality different tissue organ . Among important defect disturb hepatic glucose metabolism defective pancreatic β-cell function . Hexokinase IV , commonly know glucokinase , predominant hexokinase express liver , pancreatic β-cells ( function glucose sensor insulin secretion ) glucose-sensory cell hypothalamus gut . The glucokinase gene contain two distinct promoter . The downstream one active hepatocytes upstream promoter active extrahepatic glucose sensory-cells . Alternative promoter enable differential regulation gene transcription liver extrahepatic site . In pancreatic β-cells , glucokinase expression mRNA level largely constitutive , whereas liver undergoes large adaptive change response nutritional state , enable large change glucokinase activity would otherwise possible post-transcriptional regulation alone . Most MODY-2 patient find glucokinase mutation locate area common liver pancreas . The diabetes patient related defect insulin secretion abnormal hepatic glucose metabolism . Point mutation pancreatic specific promoter recently describe cause impaired fasting glucose [ Diabetes 58:1929-1935 , 2009 ] . The investigator recently identify MODY-2 family genetic defect locate pancreatic promoter , spar liver promoter . This family demonstrate abnormal insulin secretion alone ( perhaps together extrahepatic glucose sensor ) enough cause diabetes . In study , investigator would like use oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) technique order elucidate relative roll hepatic glucokinase normal glucose homeostasis . This issue complicate fact addition glucokinase , hexokinase isoenzymes I , II III also express low level hepatocytes . They important back-up mechanism glucokinase activity compromise , liver cirrhosis murine model liver-specific glucokinase knock-down . However , impaired hepatic glycogen synthesis demonstrate MODY-2 subject ( JCI 1996:98:1755 ) . By compare member investigator MODY-2 family member MODY-2 family normal control investigator hope shade light question .</brief_summary>
