	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiac arrest life-threatening event . Intensivists challenge increase number patient uncertain neurological outcome follow cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) . The prognostic value current biomarkers neurophysiologic long-term outcome limit . Therefore , identification novel plasma marker higher predictive value neurophysiological recovery critical patient management CPR . Hypothesis : We hypothesize specific brain-derived tissue leakage protein identify reveal novel , reliable prognostic biomarkers good neurological outcome . Methods : This translational study ( n=100 ) combination prospective basic science study intend reduce number potential plasma biomarker candidate proteomic shotgun analysis brain tissue autopsy sample plasma sample resuscitate patient ( n=10 ) prospective clinical validation study large study population ( n=100 ) high-throughput analysis , include patient use proteomic analysis , outcome compare patient . Samples analyze proteomic shotgun analysis use Q-Exactive quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer ( MS ) . MS/MS data interpret MaxQuant Perseus Software . In order identify brain-derived protein within plasma , plasma proteome 10 resuscitate patient compare proteomic profile brain tissue . This reduce number potential plasma biomarker candidate associate neurologic outcome . The prospective validation plasma sample perform targeted proteomics approach use select reaction monitoring ( SRM ) triple quadrupole ion MS . Neurological outcome assess five-point scale ( death , persistent vegetative state , severe disability , moderate disability , good recovery ) accord cerebral performance category ( CPC ) . A CPC sore &lt; 3 consider good neurological outcome . Selection proteomic marker signature estimation perform L1 regularize logistic regression , tune parameter optimize cross-validated model performance . The signature 's ability discriminate patient good poor outcome describe ROC analysis . Clinical perspective : An accurate predictor neurological outcome follow CPR utmost clinical importance . However , previous study focus limited array biomarkers . Therefore , structure proteomic analysis approach might identify best marker protein liberate cellular damage .</detailed_description>
