	<brief_summary>This study use ingestion sensor wearable sensor ( worn patch skin ) , new Proteus Digital Health ( PDH ) technology approve FDA , collect information patient take TB medication . The wearable sensor record information , upload wirelessly mobile device secure computer . Together sensor mobile device transmit information study computer call digital health feedback system ( DHFS ) , give healthcare provider information patient take TB medication . The advantage DHFS patient take medication convenient , wait nurse directly observe take medication . The purpose study find use new technology work well standard method observe person patient take TB medication . This study also look cost use DHFS TB medication , patient healthcare provider think use , factor determine one approach work well another . This study two part . For first part study ( Step I ) , patient initial screen visit , one two-week period , 4 study visit UCSD AntiViral Research Center ( AVRC ) routine visit Public Health Services ( PHS ) worker . This part study design confirm DHFS work correctly accurately collect information dose medication patient take , understand patient healthcare provider think use DHFS . If patient eligible second part study ( Step II ) want continue , last another 8-14 week additional 4 study visit AVRC . In second part study , patient randomize one follow two group . Group 1 : TB treatment monitor continue use DHFS Group 2 : TB treatment monitor standard method use PHS ( DOT ) The second part study design compare two method observe patient take TB medication , relative cost method , perception patient and/or healthcare provider ease use novel technology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PHARMACOKINETIC ( PK ) SUBSTUDY The purpose PK substudy prospectively evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter isoniazid ( INH ) rifampin ( RIF ) concentration derive dose Rifamate give native format compare encapsulate , ingestion sensor-enabled format . The UCSD substudy aim co-enroll 12 patient Phase 1- two-week investigation period characteristic use DHFS patient acceptability . These subject randomize start either Phase 1 two week native Rifamate follow 24-hour PK sampling .</detailed_description>
