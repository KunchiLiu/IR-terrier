	<brief_summary>Context : Studies address specifically neurocognitive consequence cause low-dose radiation receive childhood still perform . In issue , focus investigation patient receive radiotherapy benign tumor ( skin hemangioma ) , France . Patients method : More 8300 child skin hemangioma treat Gustave Roussy ( Île-de-France ) 1941 1973 number receive radiotherapy . These patient treat followed Gustave Roussy , clinical record track great accuracy ionize radiation dose brain estimate . From patient cohort , aim evaluate neurocognitive dysfunction disorder cause low-dose radiation brain ( le one Gray ( Gy ) ) . A total 150 patient expect . They contact letter explain purpose method carry test . Two group analyse accord receive ionizing radiation dose brain radiotherapy ( expose : 0.05 1 Gy , v unexposed : less 0.05 Gy ) . Tests explore several cognitive function ( memory , arithmetic , orientation , etc . ) use . Expected result : We expect describe potential neurocognitive dysfunction disorder identify risk factor brain structure whose lesion responsible neurocognitive dysfunction disorder . A therapeutic treatment propose eventuality screen neurocognitive dysfunction disorder .</brief_summary>
