	<detailed_description>Executive summary : The efficacy current standard rehabilitation treatment complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) , painful syndrome mostly occur musculoskeletal trauma , suboptimal . For instance , first line treatment rehabilitation , progressive motor imagery ( GMI ) , induce 50 % improvement symptom . Although improvement interesting , solution seek enhance clinical outcome . It thus essential explore new option therapy . A potential solution enhance clinical outcome would add electrotherapeutic procedure , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . Given positive result previously obtain patient neuropathic pain , hypothesize tDCS induce functional structural reorganization cortex lead good pain relief . The cortical reorganization frequently observe CRPS patient mainly involve shrinkage cortical map affect limb primary secondary somatosensory cortex . Interestingly , therapies aim reverse cortical reorganization often associate decrease pain . Therefore , combine GMI tDCS could lead add pain relief compare traditional GMI treatment alone . Furthermore , neuroimaging procedure could help u explain achieve . Objectives : Thus , primary objective research study therapeutic efficacy tDCS treatment CRPS type 1 addition current best evidence-based rehabilitation treatment , GMI . The second objective study , MRI/fMRI , brain structure function change follow tDCS GMI treatment , whether change correlate clinical change . Methodology : To achieve first objective , recruit adult diagnose CRPS type 1 via establish collaboration different physician university affiliate hospital . Participants randomly allocate one two treatment group A ) experimental group , receive GMI tDCS stimulation ; B ) control group , receive GMI sham [ placebo ] tDCS stimulation . GMI treatment compose three-phase protocol , last two week . The GMI treatment perform use software well-established procedure ( www.noigroup.com ) . For part , tDCS apply 5 consecutive day first 2 week phase 1 week 4 week . The anodic ( positive ) stimulation motor cortex ( M1 ) contralateral affect limb sought modulate cortical excitability promote pain inhibition cortical reorganization . Sample size estimate ( β:80 % , α 5 % ) show 15 subjects/group necessary . Anticipated result impact propose project : This project allow u investigate therapeutic efficacy innovative approach treatment CRPS , primarily purpose enhance clinical outcome GMI . In event positive result , able examine therapeutic benefit modality large clientele even population ( i.e. , patient chronic low back pain ) . In addition , result may contribute creation clinical practice guide , since currently insufficient evidence-based data establish guideline regard non-pharmacological treatment CRPS . Finally , MRI/fMRI analysis help u capture phenomenon tDCS-driven cortical reorganization .</detailed_description>
