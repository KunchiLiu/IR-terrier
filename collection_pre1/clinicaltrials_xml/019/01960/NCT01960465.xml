	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) major public health problem U.S. 35 % Veterans high risk OSA . OSA associate progression hypertension , important health problem Veterans . African Americans OSA increase risk poorly control hypertension health consequence . Implementing care plan increase percentage Veterans blood pressure goal achieve prioritized Veterans Administration hospital . Recent study show hypertension control improve continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment OSA . The aim proposal examine compare effect CPAP treatment 24-hour arterial blood pressure central aortic blood pressure ( measure non-invasively cuff upper arm ) African American Veterans .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) hypertension common severe problem African American individual ( noted International Society Hypertension Blacks consensus statement ) . CPAP treatment OSA effective control hypertension patient OSA , study African Americans , high-risk population potentially large health gain . This area significance poorly control hypertension lead progression cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) morbidity population . By identify CPAP treatment-response relevant moderator response African Americans hypertension OSA , target treatment OSA implement , reduce excess burden CVD . The investigator determine relative magnitude hypertension response CPAP treatment ( ambulatory blood pressure central aortic blood pressure ) 220 African American Veterans race ( ) hypertension newly diagnose OSA ( specific aim 1 ) . The investigator measure change pathogenic biomarkers ( urinary cumulative sympathetic nervous system activity oxidative stress ) responsive CPAP treatment addition hypertension assessment . Further , investigator examine role excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) , potentially important moderator treatment response , two patient population ( specific aim 2 ) . Finally , investigator adjust outcomes assessment anticipated biological heterogeneity among self-identified African Americans measure genetic ancestry ( exploratory aim ) . This award provide foundation goal research program reduce CVD disparity diverse population target treatment OSA .</detailed_description>
