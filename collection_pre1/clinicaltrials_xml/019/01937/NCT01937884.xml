	<brief_summary>Optimal delivery nutritional support critical illness central appropriate intensive care unit management , yet fundamental gap knowledge exist regard timing , route , dose , type nutritional support critically ill infant child . Understanding optimize nutritional support pediatric critical illness important even brief period malnutrition infancy result permanent negative effect long-term neurocognitive development . Optimized nutrition support way improve morbidity survivor pediatric critical illness . Parenteral nutrition ( PN ) supplementation could improve long-term neurocognitive outcome pediatric critical illness prevent acute malnutrition , unknown effect intestinal barrier function ; propose mechanism late sepsis infectious complication critical illness . While randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) support early PN premature infant late PN critically ill adult , optimal time begin PN unknown critically ill infant child . Acute malnutrition may develop within 48 hour admission critically ill infant child , replete energy store predictive survival . And yet , due concern PN-associated infectious morbidity , current PICU standard care supplement PN child fail enterally fee , late 7 day admission . Delays nutrition may long-term effect cognitive outcome older infant child . In premature infant , PN begin within hour birth result improve 18-month neurocognitive outcome without increase infectious complication . An RCT need determine early PN critically ill infant child prevents acute malnutrition improve short long-term outcome PICU hospitalization . The central hypothesis proposal optimize early protein calorie delivery improve nutritional outcome intestinal barrier function critically ill infant child . The overall purpose study evaluate efficacy safety early PN supplement enteral nutrition improve nutritional delivery , nutritional outcome , intestinal barrier function infant child acute respiratory failure mechanically ventilate pediatric intensive care unit .</brief_summary>
