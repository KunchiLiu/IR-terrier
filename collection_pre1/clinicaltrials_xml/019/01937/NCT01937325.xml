	<brief_summary>Ivacaftor restore CFTR function treat CF patient G551D mutation . Improvement ventilation , salt balance well-being contribute well exercise capacity level lung function . While potential improvement may variable across spectrum lung function , even small gain low level FEV1 may significant benefit subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Alfred CF Service ready initiate therapy VX-770 's cohort . Investigators therefore opportunity examine correlate improvement lung function , exercise capacity , inflammatory marker index wellbeing CF may repeatable single cohort . Investigators propose double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over study 20 patient currently await initiation ivacaftor therapy . Patients enrol study ask undergo screening ( day -28 ) , baseline assessment ( day 0 ) re-assessment study ( day 28 ) treatment period 1 , follow baseline assessment begin treatment period 2 ( day 56 ) conclusion treatment period 2 ( day 84 ) . A assessment ( day 224 ) perform 140 ( +/-7 ) day follow commencement open label Ivacaftor . After satisfy eligibility criterion , subject randomly assign initial active treatment placebo follow 4 week run-in period . After completion period 1 4 week washout period , subject cross-over alternative treatment . After 4 week period 2 , subject undergo final assessment show diagram . However participant choose continue take ivacaftor Named Patient Program another similar program run Vertex Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , ( 'Vertex ' ) , end study period require undergo Safety Follow-Up visit 28 day final dose study drug .
