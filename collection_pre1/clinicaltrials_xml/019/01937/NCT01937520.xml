	<brief_title>Acupuncture Reduction Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acupuncture traditionally use Asia increasingly popular Western country treat variety condition ( 1 ) . In recent year , acupuncture widely use assist improve pain inflammatory disease ( 2 ) . However , mechanism associate treatment influence immune system yet understood . Cytokines like interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) propose proximal mediator early stage inflammation . They modulate many early inflammatory response induce tissue injury , infection , immune stimulus ( 3 , 4 ) . Although response critical first line defense pathogen , inflammatory reaction uncontrolled , cause damage host initial stimulus . TNF-α pro-inflammatory cytokine effective local systemic inflammation ( 5 ) . In addition , TNF-α increase production inflammatory cytokine IL-1β , IL-6 , interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) inflammatory process . Therefore , initially bring infection control , produce coagulation damage tissue , stimulate tissue improvement . An excessive increase TNF-α level cause extreme immune reaction contributes development atherosclerosis , shock , endotoxemia , chronic inflammatory disease rheumatoid arthritis , ankylose spondylitis , inflammatory bowel disease ( 5-7 ) . Yim colleague report decrease increase serum TNF-α , IL-6 , interferon gamma level arthritis result electroacupuncture treatment ( 9 ) . In rat model ulcerative colitis , acupuncture inhibit expression IL-1β IL-6 ( 10 ) . It report acupuncture significantly reduce complete Freund 's adjuvant-induced hind paw edema mouse air pouch inflammation ( 11 , 12 ) . Acupuncture could also improve immune dysfunction surgical stress human animal ( 13 , 14 ) . Some cytokine pro-inflammatory , others anti-inflammatory ( 3 ) . The anti-inflammatory interleukin comprise interleukine-4 ( IL-4 ) interleukine-10 ( IL-10 ) consider mediate down-regulation immune-inflammatory condition . Acupuncture treatment ulcerative colitis rat possibly related decrease IL-1β , pro-inflammatory cytokine , increase IL-4 , anti-inflammatory cytokine ( 15 ) . Therefore , reasonable expect protective action acupuncture exert modulation pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine . The restoration balance pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine acupuncture give mechanisms underlie immune-modulation effect acupuncture . Inflammation associate pain hypersensitivity produce release inflammatory mediator . The pro-inflammatory cytokine play essential role pain sensitization ( 16 ) . The peripheral effect cytokine sensitize nociceptors well document ( 16 ) . Post-operative surgical pain cause significant physiologic psychologic distress patient . An increase pain duration intensity surgery contribute variety complication , include delay ambulation , pulmonary thromboembolic complication , increase length hospital stay , generalize distress anxiety . Effective post-surgical pain relief require multidisciplinary effort influence patient ' satisfaction care successful outcomes ( 17 ) . Acupuncture use long time reduction pain . In light factor , use acupuncture may allow reduction dosage conventional analgesic highly valuable low incidence possible adverse effect . Several trial demonstrate patient receive acupuncture prior surgery low level pain , reduce opioid requirement , low incidence post-operative nausea vomiting , low sympatho-adrenal response ( 18 ) . The local release β-endorphin could responsible analgesic effect . β-endorphin may interact cytokine reduce pain acupuncture may amplify interaction β-endorphin cytokine . The investigator ask patient undergo thyroid parathyroid surgery determine acupuncture restore balance pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine reduce pain inflammation , , surgery . The effect acupuncture post-surgical pain evaluate . Protocol A prospective randomize , double-blinded ( patient data collector ) , study 30 patient undergoing thyroid parathyroid surgery general anesthesia , conduct compare effect acupuncture level circulate cytokine acupuncture group control group . The control group receive anesthetic surgical technique without acupuncture . The principal investigator use Large intestine 4 ( LI-4 ) , Large intestine 11 ( LI-11 ) , Stomach 36 ( ST-36 ) acupuncture point ( acupoints ) . LI-4 LI-11 acupoints lie Large intestine meridian ( pathway ) . The Large intestine meridian run frontal neck region include thyroid . LI-4 point locate middle 2nd metacarpal bone radial side LI-11 point locate lateral end transverse cubital crease . Acupuncture two acupoints show increase immune-modulatory effect include cytotoxicity leukocyte ( 19 , 20 ) . ST-36 point locate outside anterior crest tibia knee . This point commonly use reduce general body pain ( 21 ) . The acupuncture procedures perform anesthesiologist license . After clean skin alcohol swab , acupuncture needle ( 30 Gauge , 0.30X30 millimeter , Mac Spring Handle Needle , Korea ) swiftly insert approximately 5-10 mm deep bilaterally LI-4 LI-11 acupoints arm ST-36 acupoint leg . Electroacupuncture ( EA ) deliver stimulator ( Digital Electronic Acupunctoscope 4-C , Model AWQ-104L™ Hong Kong , Dist Lhasa Medical , Weymouth , MA ) via electrode stimulator 10 Hz frequency electrical current continuous wave . This setting show significant anti-hyperalgesic effect rat inflammation model ( 22 , 23 ) also inhibit up-regulation IL-1β messenger Ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) compare sham control rat model bone cancer pain ( 24 ) . EA particularly therapeutic method small electrical charge applied acupuncture needle insert acupoints . EA advantage combine stimulation needle electricity compare manual acupuncture alone , may potentiate effect acupuncture treatment along meridian . One end electrode attach acupuncture needle handle LI-4 acupoint , another end attach acupuncture needle handle LI-11acupoint bilaterally . For EA ST-36 , one end electrode attach right side ST-36 acupoint another end attach left side ST-36 acupoint . A symmetrical biphasic wave deliver electrode electrode alternately positive negative bilateral LI-4 , LI-11 , ST-36 acupoints stimulate alternately . Mild muscle twitch observe . The investigator stimulate acupoints follow : 1 . EA perform 30 min ( time similar use clinical practice ) . 2 . EA stop 30 min treatment , leave needle acupoints . 3 . Subsequently , EA re-initiated additional 30 min . This advanced EA technique show increased nitric oxide production second interval EA first interval , reduce blood pressure end second interval preliminarily study ( 25 ) . In addition , technique increase transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 receptor immunoreactivity acupoints compare non-acupoints ( 26 ) . The advanced EA treatment start begin surgery . At conclusion surgical procedure , acupuncture needle remove . The subject awaken meet criterion extubation transfer Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) . Blood Samples A second intravenous line place arm induction anesthesia prior surgical incision collect blood sample . 15 ml blood collect three time point : ( 1 ) preinduction , ( 2 ) advance EA treatment ( 3 ) arrival PACU prior additional medication administration ( approximately 120 minute post preinduction sample ) . These specimen place vacutainer tubes anti-coagulant . Blood drawn syringe attach directly angiocatheter place intravenously . To prevent hemolysis , blood transfer without needle , vacutainer whose top remove . The vacutainer top replace specimen label study name , subject 's study ID number , sample number , date . Bloods first two time point keep refrigerated final sample obtain postoperatively . Blood sample transport Institute Complementary Alternative Medicine/School Health Related Professions Interprofessional Health Research Laboratory within Department Clinical Lab Sciences ( G level , Bergen Building , 65 Bergen St. , Newark ) . They centrifuge , serum remove , aliquoted , store -80C analysis . Laboratory Analysis Samples analyze level cortisol , C-reactive protein , cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -1α , IL-1β , IL-1ra , IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , TNF-α , appropriate method , include ELISA multiplex fluorescent bead technology . All sample run duplicate plate reagent lot . In addition test Adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , glucose insulin evaluate response stress . Any sample vary great 15 % duplicate repeat .</detailed_description>
