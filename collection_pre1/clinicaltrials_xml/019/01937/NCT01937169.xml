	<brief_summary>Neurons brain require blood oxygen proper function . The term `` neurovascular coupling '' postulate 19th century Roy &amp; Sherrington refer increase blood flow active neuron . The rationale research relies neurovascular coupling , suggest increase blood flow active region brain supply blood , also pharmacological agent present blood system time . Thus , active region affect agent ( =drug ) great extent . In present study focus dopaminergic system , critical many function cognition , response stimuli movement . One well-known dopaminergic pathway brain nigrostriatal pathway , mediate motor function . In research , intend examine effect couple functional activation pathway dopaminergic agent , Carbidopa/Levodopa , symptoms Restless Leg Syndrome ( RLS ) . RLS characterize irresistible urge move limb ( i.e . Akathisia ) , result prominently significant decrease quality sleep . Our research focus symptom RLS examine effect couple brain activation drug treatment . The first line treatment RLS dopaminergic drug . These drug increase dopamine level motor pathway , research aim couple activation nigrostriatal motor pathway dopaminergic treatment RLS . Functional activation achieve simple motor task , know elicit activation nigrostriatal pathway . We hypothesize drug act upon pre-activated motor system , couple brain activation drug treatment ameliorate sleep-related symptom RLS , compare treating symptom solely dopaminergic drug compare use non-motor task .</brief_summary>
