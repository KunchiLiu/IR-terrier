	<brief_summary>The colonoscopy reference examination diagnosis neoplastic lesion colon rectum . Mass screen assessment study show colonoscopic detection removal adenoma patient select fecal occult blood test reduces colorectal cancer incidence mortality . However , literature report interval cancer case adenomas , probably `` miss '' colonoscopy . In theory , use colour warm water could improve colon preparation mobilize residual faeces , decrease colic spasm increase visualization pit pattern . Preliminary American study , lead Leung et al , show clear increase adenoma detection rate . The investigator ' study involve 1 000 patient , treat Rhône-Alpes / Auvergne region . The patient present indication colonoscopy follow positive fecal occult blood test symptoms personal family history pre-cancerous colonic lesion . They randomize two study group : one group study : Group 1 : patient undergo colonoscopy wtih instillation tepid water ting blue ( Indigo Carmin® ) Group 2 : patient undergo standard colonoscopy insufflation air . The main objective show colonoscopy blue water ( Indigo Carmin® ) enable detection lesion standard colonoscopy insufflation air . The two technique also compare term tolerance , duration colonoscopy type detect lesion . In case improve detection colorectal lesion , blue water instillation technique could dramatically change gastroenterologist ' practice become reference method . The expected clinical benefit potential reveal neoplastic lesion improvement abdominal discomfort colonoscopy .</brief_summary>
