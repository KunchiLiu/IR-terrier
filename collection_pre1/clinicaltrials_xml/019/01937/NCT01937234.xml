	<brief_title>Use Antiemetic Shorten Length Labor Nulliparous Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women fulfill study inclusion exclusion criterion agree include study randomize assign receive either intravenous injection 10mg metoclopramide ( Group 1 ) volume placebo , i.e . 0.9 % sodium chloride ( Group2 ) . Randomization achieve use computer generate randomization sequence . Allocation 1:1 ratio . Record group allocation maintain resident physician whose responsibility randomization draw injection , direct involvement intrapartum decision making . After history physical examination , participant take select medication slowly IV 2 min , assign medication repeat every two hour maximum three dos . Monitoring fetal well-being labor progress Partographic representation perform . Management labor accord labor delivery standard protocol , labor dilatation progress appropriately , i.e . cervical dilatation rate &lt; 1cm/hour , amniotomy perform membrane intact . Oxytocin augmentation consider rupture membrane cervix remain unchanged two consecutive pelvic examination conduct two hour apart . Oxytocin infusion start 5mIU/min increase 5mIU/min every 15min achieve seven contraction 15 min , maximal rate oxytocin 30Miu/min . The following parameter record every patient : - Timing metoclopramide placebo injection - Timing full dilatation cervix - Duration first stage labor - Duration second stage labor - Duration third stage labor - Mode delivery - Injection delivery interval - Cervical dilatation rate - Neonatal condition birth</detailed_description>
