	<brief_title>The Effect Primary Delivery Anterior Compared With Posterior Shoulder Perineal Trauma : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Approximately 85 % vaginal delivery accompany trauma genital tract , high risk first compare subsequent vaginal birth [ 1,2 ] . Among primipara vaginal delivery , 86 % sustain vaginal perineal tear , 77 % require suture lesion [ 1,3 ] . Birth trauma associate short- long-term morbidity , include pain , discomfort , dyspareunia , fecal incontinence , perineal trauma may cause social problem affect psychological well-being mother [ 1,4 ] . The level postpartum morbidity relate degree trauma [ 5,6 ] , study preventive measure therefore interest . Genital tract trauma classify subtypes accord location severity lesion . Most study evaluate risk factor 3rd- 4th-degree perineal tear include anal sphincter complex , so-called obstetric anal sphincter injury ( OASIS ) . Predisposing factor increase maternal age , heavy birthweight , long duration second stage labour , oxytocin augmentation , occiput posterior position , instrumental delivery [ 7-9 ] . The risk increase number different risk factor [ 9 ] . Protective factor previous vaginal delivery , epidural analgesia , multiparity [ 7-9 ] . Several perineal management technique use delivery study , recent Cochrane review conclude warm compress perineal massage seem reduce risk OASIS [ 4 ] . The introduction interventional perineal protection programme also seem reduce incidence OASIS [ 10-12 ] . Leading textbooks recommend primary delivery anterior shoulder gentle traction shoulder deliver spontaneously [ 13,14 ] . However , shoulder dystocia occur , recommend manoeuvre primary delivery posterior arm primary delivery posterior shoulder , woman position hand knee ( Gaskin 's manoeuvre ) [ 15,16 ] . A computer-simulated trial manoeuvre use shoulder dystocia find primary delivery posterior arm cause 80 % reduction delivery force 70 % reduction stretch brachial plexus [ 17 ] . Primary delivery posterior shoulder could therefore advantage uncomplicated delivery , , knowledge author , various method shoulder delivery never study previously . The objective trial evaluate incidence degree perineal trauma primary delivery anterior shoulder compare primary delivery posterior shoulder vaginal birth primiparous woman randomize controlled trial . The hypothesis primary delivery posterior shoulder reduces rate degree perineal trauma . Interventions The trial intervention take place vaginal birth delivery head . The head support spontaneous rotation occur delivery , shoulder deliver accord randomization . The intervention either primary delivery anterior posterior shoulder illustrate additional movie file ( see additional file 1 2 ) . It perform midwife place hand around head baby apply gentle traction appropriate direction . All midwife train two intervention primary investigator ( HW ) secure uniform use technique . Training session include introductory video two method practical training birth phantom ( MODEL-med Sophie Mum Full Birth Obstetric Trainer , Carnegie , Australia ) . All midwife also train evaluation classification perineal tear use e-learning programme ( GynZone ApS , Aarhus , Denmark ) . Primary training session ( n = 14 ) take place February November 2013 , additional session hold every second month course trial train new midwife update previously train midwife . Attendance training session accredit midwifes deliver included patient . The participant deliver position prefer , spontaneous delivery shoulder occur , respect regardless randomization . If delivery midwife judge alternative method delivery preferred regard safety birth mother , overrule randomization . Episiotomy may use accordance local guideline judge necessary midwife . In case vacuum-assisted delivery , accord guideline perform physician , midwife delivers shoulder . Any deviation protocol registered clinical registration form . Assessment After delivery placenta , blind midwife doctor otherwise involved delivery ass perineum grade perineal tear . Tears suture officially classify cod independently trial midwife responsible delivery doctor accord hospital guideline . Secondary outcome register midwife responsible delivery . Assessors primary outcome primary investigator blind randomization . Registered 3rd 4th degree tear validate manual assessment patient record . We assume especially high degree tear may diagnose trial assessment repair . In order underestimate level high degree tear , data 3rd 4th degree tear study population register hospital register trial period retrieve end trial . These data validate patient record additional confirm case 3rd 4th degree tear study population incorporate final dataset . Discussion The purpose randomize control trial compare two method deliver shoulder vaginal delivery , perineal trauma primary outcome . The literature delivery technique limit , previous study primarily focus effect OASIS . Most study non-randomized , different shoulder delivery technique evaluate previously . Thus , strength study randomize design , intervention study , i.e . delivery shoulder vaginal delivery , outcome perineal trauma . The validity trial could affect fact several midwife perform intervention . But numerous birth assistant reality centre , thereby increase external validity generalizability trial . Additionally , might interpret limitation single-centre trial , although increase internal validity trial . tThe perineal tear evaluate several objective assessor ( midwife doctor ) , possibly might affect validity outcome assessment . We try overcome issue validate register high degree tear ( 3rd 4th degree ) examine patient record . Additionally , plan retrieve data 3rd 4th degree tear study population study period hospital register validate data patient record . We assume especially high degree tear may diagnose trial assessment . These tear register centrally registration commonly take place lesion repair . Thus , high degree tear include final analysis validate . Most delivery assistance technique use today base tradition heritage evidence base . This trial provide example vaginal delivery technique may evaluate randomize controlled trial . The result trial clarify role delivery shoulder perineal trauma thereby add knowledge recommend birth technique . For futher detail please see publish protocol : Willer H , Aabakke AJ , Krebs L.
