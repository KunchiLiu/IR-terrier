	<brief_title>Pertuzumab Trastuzumab Neoadjuvant Treatment Patients With HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate first time correlation early change SUV pCR men woman ER-negative , HER2-positive breast cancer receive trastuzumab pertuzumab ( PT ) pre-operatively . This previously evaluate patient receive antiHER2 therapy alone novel potentially practice change . The result phase 2 biomarker study use plan randomize study use predefined cut point SUV decline investigator attempt identify group individual HER2-positive early breast cancer require cytotoxic chemotherapy addition anti-HER2 agent . This non-invasive biomarker approach great interest breast cancer oncologists patient facilitate personalized approach manage patient HER2-positive disease undoubtedly spare toxicity reduce cost associated anti-cancer strategy , without compromise efficacy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female male patient , 18 year old old Histologically proven infiltrate carcinoma breast core needle biopsy : ER/PR ≤10 % stain IHC HER2 positive IHC 3+ , ISH ≥2.0 , average HER2 copy number ≥6.0 signal per cell per current ASCOCAP ( American Society Clinical Oncology College American Pathologists ) NCCN ( National Comprehensive Cancer Network ) guideline . Note : All histological diagnostic material review enrol institution require per local standard . Unresected , untreated breast cancer meet one follow clinical stage ( see Appendix A ) : T2 , T3 , T4ac lesion , N , M0 . Note : Patients inflammatory breast cancer ( T4d ) eligible . Bilateral cancer permit approval Protocol Chair . ECOG performance status 01 ( Appendix B ) Adequate organ function follow : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mm3 2 . Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 3 . Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL 4 . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min use Modified CockcroftGault method 5 . Bilirubin ( total ) ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( exception Gilberts syndrome ) 6 . AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2 time upper limit normal Adequate cardiac function define LVEF ≥ 50 % echocardiogram multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) Able amenable baseline followup PET/CT image studyspecific biopsy procedure . Note : If image concern patient may suitable quantitative PET/CT ( e.g. , metallic device directly overlie breast ) , discussion local central radiologist require confirm eligibility trial . Also , expect subject PET/CT image do prequalified machine study ; baseline image do another machine , please contact Protocol Chair/designee guidance prior confirm eligibility . The patient , childbearing potential , willing use effective , nonhormonal contraception treatment least 6 month follow last dose therapy . Patient understand study regimen , requirement , risk , discomfort , able willing sign inform consent form . Received prior ongoing local ( e.g radiation ) systemic treatment ( chemotherapy endocrine therapy ) current breast cancer . Patients receive tamoxifen raloxifene another agent prevention breast cancer may include long patient discontinue treatment least one month prior baseline study biopsy . Systemic treatment prior cancer within last 5 year , exception adequately treat conebiopsied situ carcinoma cervix uteri basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Women pregnant nursing Current use investigational agent Known hypersensitivity trastuzumab pertuzumab Any medical condition opinion investigator put patient risk potentially serious complication therapy . Specifically , uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic &gt; 150 and/or diastolic &gt; 100 ) , unstable angina , congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) classification , serious cardiac arrhythmia require treatment ( exception : atrial fibrillation , paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia ) , history myocardial infarction within 6 month enrollment .</criteria>
