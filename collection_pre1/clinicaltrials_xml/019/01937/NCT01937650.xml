	<brief_title>Radiotherapy + Metronidazole v Radiotherapy Alone In Improving Treatment Outcomes Advanced Cervical Cancer Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods A double blind placebo control trial use determine efficacy safety metronidazole adjunct radiotherapy compare radiotherapy alone treatment anemic patient advance cancer cervix measure clinical response . The unit randomization woman cancer cervix stage IIIB IVB hemoglobin level 12g/dl less . The one consent study enrol randomize either radiotherapy metronidazole ( RT+MX ) radiotherapy placebo ( RT ) arm . The study conduct Department Radiotherapy Department Obstetrics Gynecology Mulago hospital , Kampala , Uganda . Women eligible inclusion study cancer cervix histologically proven stage IIB IVB , fit radiotherapy Hb 12g/dl less . Women take metronidazole treatment reason radio-sensitization history neuropathy hypersensitivity metronidazole exclude . A randomization code generate independent statistician participate study visit study site . The randomization code place opaque seal envelope send copy pharmacist study centre get know put envelope study participant . The envelope keep study pharmacist dispense drug . The code broken principal investigator felt blinded treatment harmful patient , either side effect failure respond case would urgently notify data safety review board view break code particular patient . The total number study participant 40 . In view need equal number equally space point sequence study , random permute block four patient use . Letter A use Radiotherapy &amp; Metronidazole ( RT+MX ) B Radiotherapy alone ( RT ) assignment . The block follow : AABB - block number 1 ABBA- block number 2 BBAA - block number 3 ABAB - block number 4 BAAB - block number 5 BABA - block number 6 Treatment modality include radiotherapy administration plus Metronidazole paracetamol administration . Radiotherapy administration two phase use tele-therapy brachy-therapy . The first phase tele-therapy via parallel-opposed portal ( half dose antero-posterior half postero-anterior direction ) Co-60 radiation source , total dose 50 Gy give 25 fraction 2 Gy/day ( Monday Friday weekend rest ) five week . The patient give break 1-4 week get second phase treatment . The second phase brachy-therapy Cs-137 source , whereby single dose 30Gy deliver point A rate 2.55 Gy/ hour 7 hour 50 minute , via uterine Tandem two vaginal Ovoids . In case severe vaginal stenosis first phase , cylindrical applicator would use . Participants study arm receive 1gm ( two suppository ) metronidazole per rectum 30 minute radiotherapy every radiotherapy session omit two rest day Saturday Sunday . Participants control arm receive 500mg ( two suppository ) paracetamol placebo similar day . The study conduct day time . The metronidazole paracetamol suppository look identical colour , smell shape . Although packaging similar different label . They therefore dispensed ready use packaging patient get two suppository session . Subjective assessment clinical symptom response among study patient do every day Mulago radiotherapy department grade system cancer response ( Kigula-Mugambe 2001 ) . Response grade 4 grade follow ; Grade 1 : Complete response ( tumour clinically see symptom sign subside ) Grade 2 : Partial response ( least 50 % symptom sign subside ) Grade 3 : No response ( symptoms sign change treatment ) Grade 4 : Disease progression treatment ( symptom sign end treatment worse begin treatment ) Measurement tumour regression do trans-abdominal real time B-mode ultrasound scan begin end tele-therapy . It aim measure wide transverse diameter , thickness length cervical tumour . The tumour volume compute ultrasound machine . Patients need full urinary bladder ultrasound do . Local tumour response measure use formula Local tumour response = { ( Volume A - Volume B ) /Volume A } X 100 % Where A tumour volume begin treatment B tumour volume course teletherapy . Complications subjectively assess use Franco-Italian ( Fl ) glossary radiotherapy complication March 1990 follow : Grade 0 : No complication . Grade 1 : Mild complication ( minor symptoms/signs require treatment require simple outpatient treatment ) Grade 2 ; Moderate complication ( require hospitalization without treatment break ) . Grade 3 : Severe complication ( distress complication lead treatment break life threaten morbidity e.g . fistula formation ) Grade 4 : Complications lead death/fatal</detailed_description>
