	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational combination IL-2 plus donor anti-inflammatory Treg cell also try define appropriate dose investigational combination IL-2 plus donor anti-inflammatory Treg cell use study . IL-2 involved cell signal regulation white blood cell ( WBCs ) . WBCs part immune system . Treg cell also part immune system ; involve anti-inflammatory response . `` Investigational '' mean combination IL-2 anti-inflammatory Treg cell infusion study . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve combination IL-2 anti-inflammatory Treg cell infusion use people cGVHD . Chronic GVHD medical condition may occur receive bone marrow , stem cell cord blood transplant donor . The donor 's immune system may recognize body ( host ) foreign attempt 'reject ' . This process know graft-versus-host disease . Traditional standard therapy treat cGVHD prednisone ( steroid ) . Participants trial respond steroid therapy . The investigator look assess safety optimal dose combination IL-2 plus donor anti-inflammatory Treg cell , may help control cGVHD stop donor 's immune system 'rejecting ' body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After screen procedure confirm eligible participate research study : If take part research study , ( donor ) follow test procedure : Donor Lymphocytes Collection : Lymphocytes type white blood cell involve immune system . Your original marrow/stem cell donor undergo one white blood cell collection procedure call leukapheresis . Blood vein one arm circulate special machine remove white blood cell , rest blood return donor 's arm . The cell collect leukapheresis send laboratory amount white blood cell collect measure . A sample remove study test , remain lymphocyte set-aside infusion . Donor Lymphocyte Processing : Once lymphocytes collected donor , CliniMACS System device enrich ( preferentially select ) number Treg cell . Samples take processing CliniMACS System examine cell . After complete necessary safety test , Treg-enriched donor lymphocyte cell ready administration . Donor Cellular Infusion ( DCI ) : The Treg-enriched donor lymphocyte infuse intravenous ( I.V . ) catheter approximately 5-10 minute . Prior infusion , receive Tylenol Benadryl prevent transfusion relate reaction . You observe 1 hour infusion . The total anticipated time spend clinic approximately 2 hour . Since investigator look high one-time dose anti-inflammatory donor cell administer safely combination IL-2 without severe unmanageable side effect participant cGVHD , everyone participates research study receive dose donor cell . The cell dose get depend number participant enrol study well tolerate cell dos . Study Drug : You give give IL-2 daily injection skin . You every day 8 week , start day donor Treg cell infusion . You 4 week IL-2 . IL-2 provide single-use ( one-time ) syrinx refrigerate home 36 - 46°F ( 2 - 8°C ) . During first 6 week IL-2 , continue take steroid immune suppress medication without change dose doctor set IL-2 . After 6 week IL-2 therapy , doctor may reduce amount steroid take . If cGVHD improve 8 week IL-2 , may option continue extended-duration therapy . Extended-duration therapy daily IL-2 treatment start end-of-study visit week 12 . Your doctor discus option . If continue extended-duration IL-2 therapy complete week 12 evaluation , assess follow schedule : - Clinic visit evaluation toxicity clinical benefit approximately every 4 week - Immunologic assay approximately every 8 week . Immunologic assay measure effect IL-2 immune cell . Drug Diary : Each day first 8 week take IL-2 day extend-duration IL-2 ( applicable ) , ask document , drug diary , take drug inject . The diary also include special instruction take study drug ( ) . The diary also ask entire syringe inject , issue relate IL-2 . You ask return drug diary clinic every 14 day receive IL-2 . If continue take IL-2 extend-duration portion , return drug diary every 8 week ( clinic visit ) . Chronic GVHD Assessments : While study , member study team examine evaluate cGVHD . These assessment may include examination skin , joints/muscles , eye , mouth , lungs gastrointestinal system ( example , whether experienced nausea , vomit , diarrhea , difficulty swallow ) . The investigator also look range motion different body part ( example , arm ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Recipient allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Participants must steroidrefractory cGVHD . Steroidrefractory cGVHD define persistent sign symptom cGVHD ( Appendix D ; section 17.4 ) despite use prednisone ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day ( 0.5 mg/kg every day ) least 4 week ( equivalent dose alternate glucocorticoid ) without complete resolution sign symptom . Participants either extensive chronic GVHD limit chronic GVHD require systemic therapy eligible . Stable dose glucocorticoid 4 week prior enrollment No addition subtraction immunosuppressive medication ( e.g. , calcineurininhibitors , sirolimus , mycophenolatemofetil ) 4 week prior enrollment . The dose immunosuppressive medicine may adjust base therapeutic range drug Patient age 18 year old . Because dose adverse event data currently available use IL2 participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . ECOG performance status 02 ( Appendix A ; section 17.1 ) Participants must adequate organ function define : Hepatic : Adequate hepatic function ( total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dlexception permit participant Gilbert 's Syndrome ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2x ULN ) , unless hepatic dysfunction manifestation presume cGVHD . For participant abnormal LFTs sole manifestation cGVHD , document GVHD liver biopsy require prior enrollment . Abnormal LFTs context active cGVHD involve organ system may also permit treat physician document abnormal LFTs consistent hepatic cGVHD , liver biopsy mandate situation . Pulmonary : FEV1 ≥ 50 % DLCO ( Hb ) ≥ 40 % predict , unless pulmonary dysfunction deem due chronic GVHD Renal : Serum creatinine less upper limit normal institutional limit creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Adequate bone marrow function indicate ANC &gt; 1000/mm3 platelet &gt; 50,000/mm3 without growth factor transfusion Cardiac : No myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment NYHA Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality screen must document investigator medically relevant . The effect IL2 develop human fetus unknown . For reason chemotherapeutic agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Ongoing prednisone requirement &gt; 1 mg/kg/day ( equivalent ) Concurrent use calcineurininhibitor plus sirolimus ( either agent alone acceptable ) History thrombotic microangiopathy , hemolyticuremic syndrome thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura New chronic GVHD therapy ( e.g . gleevec , extracorporeal photopheresis , rituximab , immunosuppressive medication ) 4 week prior Lowdose IL2 therapy 4 week prior Posttransplant exposure Tcell alternative IL2 target medication ( e.g . ATG , alemtuzumab , basiliximab , denileukin diftitox ) within 100 day prior Donor lymphocyte infusion within 100 day prior Active malignant relapse Active uncontrolled infection Inability comply IL2 treatment regimen Organ transplant ( allograft ) recipient HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction agent use allogeneic HSCT . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Individuals active uncontrolled hepatitis B C ineligible high risk lethal treatmentrelated hepatotoxicity HSCT . Other investigational drug within 4 week prior enrollment , unless clear Principal Investigator . Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother , breastfeed discontinue .</criteria>
