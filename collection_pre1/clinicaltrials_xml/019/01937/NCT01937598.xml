	<brief_title>Antidiabetic Effects Adding DPP-4 Inhibitor Pre-Existing Treatment With Incretin Mimetic Patients With T2D</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind , control , cross-over comparison add sitagliptin ( placebo ) pre-existing metformin+liraglutide therapy . Patients type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) pre-existing treatment metformin ( ≥ 1500 mg/d ) monotherapy metformin plus liraglutide ( 1.2 mg/d ) study . Patients metformin monotherapy , screen randomization , enter run-in period 2 week additional treatment liraglutide ( 0.6 mg/d 1 week follow 1.2 mg/d another week ) . At end 2 week therapy , mixed meal challenge take place , assessment glucose hormone response ( insulin , C-peptide , glucagon , GLP-1 [ glucagon-like peptide-1 ] , GIP ( gastric inhibitory peptide ) gastric empty measure 13C ( carbon 13 ) -octanoate breath test . Prior meal test , liraglutide administer dose 1.2 mg per injection , recommend dose treatment . Sitagliptin use dose 100 mg , recommend clinical use .</detailed_description>
