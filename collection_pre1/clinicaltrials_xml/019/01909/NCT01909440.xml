	<brief_title>Resistance Training Protein Supplementation Increasing Lean Body Mass Prostate Cancer Survivors Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine effect progressive , structure resistance training ( RT ) program , without protein supplementation ( PS ) , lean body mass ( LBM ) prostate cancer survivor ( PCS ) androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . Increases LBM may influence additional outcome physical function , quality life ( QOL ) molecular pathway regulate skeletal muscle . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine effect structure RT program , without PS , muscle strength , physical function , QOL PCS ADT . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine effect progressive , structured RT program , without PS , anabolic catabolic molecular regulator skeletal muscle PCS ADT . II . To examine effect progressive , structured RT program , without PS , bone turnover marker bone mineral density PCS ADT . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 arm . ARM I : Patients undergo total body high-intensity RT thrice weekly , perform static stretching exercise session . Exercises progress low intensity high volume high intensity lower volume course 12-week program . Patients also receive whey protein supplementation orally twice day 12 week . ARM II : Patients undergo total body RT stretch Arm I . ARM III : Patients receive whey protein supplementation Arm I . Patients also undergo home flexibility program 3 time per week , consist static stretching exercise perform RT . After 12 week , may undergo RT program Arm 1 . ARM IV : Patients undergo home flexibility program Arm III . After 12 week , patient may undergo total body RT Arm 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
