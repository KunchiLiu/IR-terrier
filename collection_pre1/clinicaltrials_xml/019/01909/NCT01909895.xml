In application , state-of-the-art , laboratory-based , randomize control experiment propose test whether provoke anger , depress mood anxiety induce endothelial dysfunction human .

We also examine whether depressed mood anxiety induction task similarly induce endothelial dysfunction , well whether level provoke self-reported anger , depress mood , anxiety associate degree endothelial dysfunction . Finally , give endogenous nitric oxide ( NO ) inhibition play central role exacerbate endothelial dysfunction , explore whether NO inhibition partially mediate acute adverse effect provoke anger , depress mood , anxiety endothelial function . In United States , atherosclerosis-related CVD event remain leading cause morbidity mortality . Further , anger , depress mood , anxiety negative emotion commonly experience adult general population day-to-day basis . Therefore , evaluation hypothesis timely highly significant , help identify putative biological pathway link experience core negative emotion CVD incidence , large number individual increase risk CVD event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event remain leading cause morbidity mortality industrialize nation . Atherosclerosis diffuse disease characterize deposition lipid blood-borne material within arterial wall . Evidence demonstrate disruption arterial atherosclerotic plaque subsequent thrombus formation responsible onset CVD event . Cardiovascular research effort direct toward identification early underlying factor initiate cascade . It known time experience negative emotion associate increase risk incident CVD event , independent traditional risk factor . Among best-studied negative emotion anger . Population-based study demonstrate experience anger trigger incident CVD event . The mechanism ( ) provoke anger acutely affect pathway underlie atherosclerosis development progression remain fully characterize . Endothelial dysfunction promise mechanism may explain link anger incident CVD event . Vascular endothelial cell ( ECs ) play essential role maintain vascular tone integrity blood vessel . Evidence suggest endothelial dysfunction early pathogenic process underlie atherosclerosis development CVD event onset . Our preliminary finding show apparently healthy individual , anger recall task acutely induce endothelial dysfunction impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation , injure ECs , disrupt molecular process underlie EC reparative capacity . We additionally find task may induce endogenous nitric oxide ( NO ) inhibition , play central role aggravate endothelial dysfunction . Therefore , NO inhibition may partially mediate anger-provoked endothelial dysfunction . Although strong data anger-provoked CVD event , also evidence experience core negative emotion depress mood anxiety may trigger CVD event . Whether provocation depress mood anxiety acutely induce endothelial dysfunction NO inhibition remain determined . The overall aim study primarily examine acute effect provoke anger secondarily depress mood anxiety EC health . We also explore whether NO inhibition partially mediate acute effect anger , depress mood , anxiety endothelial function . Examination critical pathway help identify biological pathway experience core negative emotion lead incident CVD risk . To address highly significant research question , propose state-of-the-art , laboratory-based , randomize control experiment 280 participant randomize one four experimental condition : anger recall task ( N=70 ) , depress mood recall task ( N=70 ) , anxiety recall task ( N=70 ) , emotionally neutral condition ( N=70 ) . Our specific study aim hypothesis follow : Primary Hypotheses : Compared neutral condition , anger recall task acutely induce endothelial dysfunction : impairing endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation ( Hypothesis 1a ) ; increase circulating level EC-derived microparticles ( EMPs ) , marker EC injury ( Hypothesis 1b ) ; reduce circulating level bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) , marker EC reparative capacity ( Hypothesis 1c ) . Secondary Hypotheses : Compared neutral condition , depress mood separately anxiety recall task acutely impair endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation , increase circulating level EMPs , reduce circulate level bone marrow-derived EPCs . There relation level self-reported anger , depress mood , anxiety endothelial dysfunction .</detailed_description>
