	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response DNA/MVA Vaccines HIV-1-Infected Young Adults Taking Anti-HIV Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety immune response combination two vaccine : multigene DNA HIV-1 vaccine also express GM-CSF ( GEO-D03 ) MVA HIV-1 ( MVA/HIV62B ) vaccine . HIV-1-infected young adult suppress viral level , likely acquire ( Clade B ) HIV-1 infection sexual contact , highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) randomly assign one two study arm . Arm A participant receive GEO-D03 vaccine entry Week 8 MVA/HIV62B vaccine Weeks 16 24 . Arm B participant receive placebo vaccine entry Weeks 8 , 16 , 24 . Study duration 120 week ( 24 week vaccination plus 96 week follow-up ) . Study participant remain HAART throughout study . Study visit occur screen , entry , Weeks 1 , 8 , 9 , 16 , 17 , 24 , 25 , 36 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 . At study visit , participant undergo blood collection , physical exam , adherence assessment . At screen , participant also undergo electrocardiogram ( ECG ) urine collection . Some blood sample store future use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV1 infect . More detail criterion find protocol . Likely HIV1 acquisition North America Europe ( opinion site investigator ) Likely HIV1 acquisition sexual transmission ( opinion site investigator ) On stable HAART , define least three different antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) two different class , plasma HIV1 RNA level fewer 100 copies/mL least 12 month prior screen . Furthermore , least two plasma HIV1 RNA level fewer 100 copies/mL ( none plasma HIV1 RNA level 100 copies/mL ) , separate least 3 month must document 6month period prior enrollment . Ability willingness participant provide sign write informed consent CD4 count 400 cells/mm^3 great screen The following lab value ( screen visit ) : Creatine phosphokinase high 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . More detail criterion find protocol . Troponin I 1.0 time ULN Hemoglobin great 10 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count great 1,000 mm^3 Platelets great 100,000 mm^3 Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) great 1.5 time ULN Total bilirubin great 1.5 time ULN ( less 5 time ULN take atazanavir ) Creatinine le 2.0 mg/dL Female participant engage sexual activity could lead pregnancy must agree avoid pregnancy consistently use two method contraception , include least one form barrier contraception , screen visit 90 day final vaccination . Medically acceptable contraceptive include barrier method ( condom diaphragm ) use spermicide , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , approve hormonal contraceptive , birth control pill , Depo Provera , Lupron Depot . Condoms recommend appropriate use contraception method effective prevent HIV1 transmission . Two method barrier contraception ( condom diaphragm ) may combine meet requirement . Sexually active female study participant without reproductive potential eligible without require use contraception . Written oral documentation communicate clinician clinician 's staff one following required participant : physician report/letter discharge summary . To prevent pregnancy , male participant must agree attempt impregnate female participate sperm donation program . Males engage sexual activity could lead pregnancy must use condom date receipt first study vaccine 90 day receipt last study vaccine . To prevent HIV1 transmission partner , participant participate sexual activity must agree use effective barrier method ( condom ) Willing comply study requirement , include adherence ARV treatment prescribe regular healthcare provider expectation available duration study Documentation infection HIV1 Clade B ( e.g. , genotype data available pretreatment viral resistance analysis ) Documentation last CD4 Tcell count prior initiation ARV few 300 cells/mm^3 Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C virus RNA positive History know active cardiac disease include : evidence past evolve myocardial infarction angina pectoris congestive heart failure permanent sequela cardiomyopathy ( hypertrophic dilate ) myocarditis pericarditis clinically significant arrhythmia ( include arrhythmia require medication , treatment , clinical followup ) stroke transient ischemic attack anginal chest pain shortness breath mild activity ( walk upstairs ) due cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] class 24 ) Screening ECG clinically significant finding feature would interfere assessment myo/pericarditis , include follow : Conduction disturbance ( complete leave complete right bundle branch block nonspecific intraventricular conduction disturbance QRS great 120 m , atrioventricular ( AV ) block degree , QTc prolongation ( great 450 m ) Pathologic repolarization ( ST segment T wave ) abnormality Significant atrial ventricular arrhythmia Frequent atrial ventricular ectopy ( e.g. , frequent premature atrial contraction , multifocal two premature ventricular contraction row ) Clinically significant , HIVrelated renal disease screen enrollment ( creatinine least 2.0 mg/dL ; persistent high grade proteinuria great 2+ ) . If either finding present screening , test may repeat option enrollment finding resolve . Past present , HIVrelated neurocognitive disease identify care provider Known hypersensitivity vaccine component Receipt chemotherapy active malignancy past 12 month Prior vaccination HIV1 vaccine Prior immunization poxvirus , include vaccinia Receipt immunomodulatory agent , oral inject systemic corticosteroid 7 day time ( include nonprescription street steroid ) , gamma globulin , investigational agent within 6 month screen . Use intranasal inhale corticosteroid allow . Receipt live license vaccine within 4 week inactivate licensed vaccine within 2 week prior study enrollment Pregnancy breastfeed Current document suspect serious bacterial infection , metabolic illness , malignancy , immediate lifethreatening condition Any clinically significant disease ( HIV infection ) clinically significant finding screen medical history physical examination , site investigator 's opinion , would compromise outcome study Active alcohol substance abuse ( abuse define use alcohol substance likely interfere ability participant adhere medication return study visit likely lead AEs ) Any foreseeable circumstance , opinion site investigator , likely jeopardize participant adherence HAART ( i.e. , insurance problem , housing instability , unemployment )</criteria>
