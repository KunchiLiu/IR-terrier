	<brief_summary>The respiratory gastrointestinal infection common problem high morbidity child . These condition due , general , immaturity `` inexperience '' immune system , well particular anatomical structure function respiratory gastrointestinal tract still develop . This inevitably mean school-age child develop disease ( result infection ) easily later age . The frequency duration condition imply high discomfort incur significant cost relation drug administration , need hospitalization , day absence school work day lose parent . Recently probiotic , define `` microorganism prove able , ingested adequate amount , exert beneficial function body `` proposed treatment treatment respiratory gastrointestinal infection childhood recent year conduct controlled clinical trial conclusively proven effectiveness . All probiotic induce immune response , characteristic related strain mixture bacteria use . Recent study demonstrate positive effect probiotic respiratory system , particular prevention reduction severity respiratory infection , probably mediate increase cell secrete Immunoglobulin A bronchial mucosa . It 'been show probiotic sure way reduce risk early acute otitis medium use antibiotic recurrent respiratory infection first year life . Similar result see study conduct population 326 child age 3 5 year , find decrease incidence antibiotic use 65 % reduction day absence 25 % among child treat probiotic . Many studied effect probiotic , understandably , refer digestive system . These effect relate condition paraphysiological ( constipation ) specifically situation illness . Most study carry recent year demonstrate efficacy specific probiotic reduce symptom pediatric population affect infectious gastroenteritis . Probiotics reduce duration infectious diarrhea 0.7 day reduce frequency diarrheal episode first hour . The microbiota hand participates function mucosal barrier adhesion pathogenic bacteria , crucial time start infectious process . When barrier function alter chemical agent , antigens stressor different nature , may manifest intestinal disorder , sometimes due growth bacteria pathogen . Numerous experimental data suggest probiotic contribute reinforcement activity gut mucosal barrier , particular aspect affect functionality intestinal epithelial cell macrophage . More recently show daily intake 3 month preparation probiotic reduce incidence severity common respiratory infection limit number day absence school child winter season . It 's scientifically recognize probiotic effect also obtain use inactivated bacteria bacterial component isolate ( eg bacterial DNA ) . It recently propose modified definition probiotic product `` prepared bacterial cell bacterial component beneficial effect health welfare host '' . Among product `` probiotic-like '' fall ingredient object study : food ingredient ( rice flour skim milk ) ferment , make grow probiotic ( Lactobacillus CBA-L74 ) inactivate end fermentation process heat treatment . The benefit attributable bacterial component remain final product ( example , DNA , cell wall , etc . ) factor produce fermentation ( short chain fatty acid , bacterial protein , etc. ) . The main effect bacterial component relate stimulation gastrointestinal tract associate lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) , interaction immune cell via Toll-like receptor . In addition , component , protein peptide , may Bifidogenic activity available literature study demonstrate ability infant formula , milk-based ferment reduce severity episode infectious diarrhea child . With data , Commission European Society Nutrition Gastroenterology , Hepatology Pediatric Nutrition ( ESPGHAN ) define type product safe determine potential prebiotic effect reduction severity episodes infectious diarrhea .</brief_summary>
