Moreover , compare international level consider ( 2 ) aftercare program help participant equally different country rehabilitation system vary intensity . This question investigate compare Germany , Netherlands China . Due demographic change , rise number old employee labor market keep . Within context , last research aim ( 3 ) examine age effect detail : Is possible determine age-specific difference effectiveness different intervention ?</detailed_description>
