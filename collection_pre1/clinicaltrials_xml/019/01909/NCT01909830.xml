	<brief_summary>Study Design : Multicenter , non randomize , open label phase II study design evaluate efficacy safety Gemcitabine/Pemetrexed combination . Enrollment period : 18 month . Treatment period : maximum 24 week patient ( 12 cycle last 2 week ) . Total duration study : 24 month . Number Subjects : Approximately 38 subject enrol study : - First stage:12 patient enrol If 1 0 response observe , trial terminate : - Second stage : additional 23 patient enrol . If 5 less response observe 35 patient , combination would consider worthy study , 6 response observe , combination would consider sufficiently active warrant testing .

	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Combination With Pemetrexed Long Term Infusion Treatment Pretreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase II Study evaluate activity toxicity Gemcitabine Combination Pemetrexed long term infusion Treatment pretreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients Study Design : Multicenter , non randomize , open label phase II study design evaluate efficacy safety Gemcitabine/Pemetrexed combination . Study Duration Enrollment period : 18 month . Treatment period : maximum 24 week patient ( 12 cycle last 2 week ) . Total duration study : 24 month . Primary objective : - objective response rate ( ORR : CR+PR+SD ) Secondary objective : - safety profile drug combination ; - time progression ( TTP ) overall survival ( OS ) Number Subjects : Approximately 38 subject enrol study : - First stage:12 patient enrol If 1 0 response observe , trial terminate : - Second stage : additional 23 patient enrol . If 5 less response observe 35 patient , combination would consider worthy study , 6 response observe , combination would consider sufficiently active warrant testing . Taking account invalidity rate 5 % , 38 patient needed step . Statistical Methodology : A minimax two-stage Simon design employ . A 10 % response preclude study , whereas 30 % response rate indicate study would warrant . Using α β error 0.10 0.10 , respectively , 12 patient enrol first stage , 1 0 response observe , trial terminate . Otherwise , additional 23 patient enrol , 5 less response observe 35 patient , combination would consider worthy study , 6 response observe , combination would consider sufficiently active warrant testing . Taking account invalidity rate 5 % , 38 patient needed step . The first 6 enrolled patient closely control safety patient enrol absence severe toxicity result discontinuation 1 month first cycle six patient . The primary analysis perform ITT ( Intention To Treat ) population . PFS OS estimate Kaplan-Meier method . The HR PFS OS estimate accord Cox model , relative 95 % confidence . A secondary analysis perform PP ( per-protocol ) population . The Overall Response Rate study treatment report ITT PP population 95 % confidence interval . Results tabulate evaluable patient include additional category .</detailed_description>
