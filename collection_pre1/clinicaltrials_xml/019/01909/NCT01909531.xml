	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Data Base Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) surgery treatment improve motor symptom associate several movement disorder disease . DBS recommend patient Parkinson 's disease respond well medication , still experience frequent wear medication return symptom . Patients may also experience trouble medication side effect dyskinesias , sleepiness , hallucination , confusion , behavioral/personality change .

The goal DBS surgery improve quality life patient family reduce motor symptom slowness , stiffness tremor possibly reduce medication . In order help understanding effect , collect information patient undergo undergone DBS surgery . St. Joseph 's Hospital Medical Center / Barrow Neurological Institute one hospital United States offer new procedure know asleep DBS surgery , perform general anesthesia , well traditional awake DBS procedure ; therefore important new asleep surgery option study compare awake DBS surgery . Objectives include : - Comparison data collect awake asleep DBS procedures pre-operative post-operative period include testing , diagnosis , surgical treatment , target accuracy , complication , motor function quality life outcome . - Comparison differential effect STN GPi DBS gait balance control - Investigate effect DBS saccadic eye movement .</detailed_description>
