	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize machine learning method use combination novel , quantitative measure cardio-respiratory variability accurately predict optimal time extubate extreme preterm infant . In multicenter prospective study , cardiorespiratory signal record 250 extreme preterm infant eligible extubation . Automated signal analysis algorithm compute variety metric infant describe cardiorespiratory state . Machine learn method use find optimal combination statistical measure clinical feature provide best overall predictor extubation readiness . Finally , investigator develop Automated system Prediction EXtubation ( APEX ) integrate software data acquisition , signal analysis , outcome prediction single application suitable use medical personnel Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . The performance APEX later clinically validate 50 additional infant prospectively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At birth , extreme preterm infant ( ≤28 week ) inconsistent respiratory drive , airway instability , surfactant deficiency immature lungs frequently result respiratory failure . Management infant difficult require endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation ( ETT-MV ) within first day life survive . ETT-MV invasive therapy associate adverse clinical outcome include ventilator-associated pneumonia , impaired neurodevelopment , increased mortality . Consequently , clinician try remove ETT-MV quickly possible . However , 25 35 % extubation attempt fail infant require reintubation , intervention also associate increased morbidity mortality . Therefore physician must determine optimal time extubation minimize duration ETT-MV maximize chance success . A variety objective measure propose assist decision none proven useful clinically . Investigators group recently explore predictive power index autonomic nervous system function base measurement heart rate ( HRV ) respiratory variability ( RV ) . The use sophisticated , automated algorithm analyze cardiorespiratory signal show promising preliminary result predict infant extubated successfully .</detailed_description>
