	<brief_summary>Although multiple study clearly demonstrate ranibizumab therapy effective laser alone vision gain avoid vision loss patient central-involved Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME ) , eyes poor visual acuity , visual acuity letter score 78 worse ( approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32 worse ) eligible . Eyes central-involved DME `` good '' visual acuity ( 20/25 well ) address systematically recent study treatment DME . Baseline cohort characteristic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) suggest substantial percentage eye central-involved DME may retain good vision . The investigator know definitively whether eye central-involved DME good vision well anti-VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) ( e.g . aflibercept ) therapy initially , focal/grid laser treatment observation initially follow anti-VEGF vision worsens . The primary objective protocol compare % eye lose least 5 letter visual acuity 2 year compare baseline mean visual acuity eye central-involved DME good visual acuity define Snellen equivalent 20/25 good ( electronic-ETDRS letter score 79 better ) receive ( 1 ) prompt focal/grid photocoagulation + defer anti-VEGF , ( 2 ) observation + defer anti-VEGF , ( 3 ) prompt anti-VEGF . Secondary objective include : - Comparing visual acuity outcomes treatment group , percent eye least 5 , 10 15 letter loss visual acuity baseline mean visual acuity , percent eye least 5 letter gain visual acuity baseline , mean visual acuity , mean change visual acuity , adjust baseline mean visual acuity - For eye randomize deferred anti-VEGF , percentage eye need anti-VEGF treatment - Comparing optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) outcomes , mean change OCT central subfield ( CSF ) thickness , adjust baseline mean thickness - Comparing number eye PDR randomization , proportion eye avoid vitreous hemorrhage panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) vitrectomy PDR treatment group - Comparing safety outcome treatment group - Comparing associate treatment follow-up exam cost treatment group</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; = 18 year 2 . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : 1 . Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes 2 . Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes 3 . Documented diabetes American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) and/or World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion . 3 . Able willing provide inform consent . Meets follow ocular criterion least one eye : 1 . Best correct EETDRS visual acuity letter score ≥ 79 ( approximate Snellen equivalent 20/25 good ) two consecutive visit within 1 28 day . 2 . On clinical exam , definite retinal thickening due DME involve center macula . 3 . Diabetic macular edema confirm OCT ( equivalent CSF thickness OCT ≥250 micron Zeiss Stratus genderspecific spectral domain OCT equivalent ) two consecutive visit within 1 28 day . ( ) Investigator must verify accuracy OCT scan ensuring center adequate quality . 4 . The investigator comfortable eye randomize three treatment group ( observation , laser , antiVEGF initially ) . ( ) If focal/grid photocoagulation contraindicate leak microaneurysms close fovea investigator believe DME present benefit focal/grid photocoagulation , eye enrol . 5 . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , individual cooperation sufficient adequate OCT fundus photograph . 1 . History chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . 2 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . 3 . Initiation intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) within 4 month prior randomization plan next 4 month . 4 . Participation investigational trial within 30 day randomization involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval indication study . ( ) Note : study participant receive another investigational drug participate study . 5 . Known allergy component study drug . 6 . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , individual become eligible . 7 . Systemic antiVEGF proVEGF treatment within 4 month prior randomization . These drug use study . 8 . For woman childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 24 month . ( ) Women potential study participant question potential pregnancy . Investigator judgment use determine pregnancy test need . 9 . Individual expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center 24 month study . Individual follow ocular characteristic : 1 . Macular edema consider due cause DME . ) An eye consider eligible : ( 1 ) macular edema consider related ocular surgery cataract extraction ( 2 ) clinical exam and/or OCT suggest vitreoretinal interface abnormality ( e.g. , taut posterior hyaloid epiretinal membrane ) contribute macular edema . 2 . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity loss would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigment abnormality , dense subfoveal hard exudate , nonretinal condition ) . 3 . An ocular condition present ( DME ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , etc. ) . 4 . Cataract present , opinion investigator , may alter visual acuity course study . 5 . Any history prior laser surgical , intravitreal , peribulbar treatment DME ( focal/grid macular photocoagulation , intravitreal peribulbar corticosteroid , antiVEGF ) . 6 . History topical steroid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) treatment within 30 day prior randomization . 7 . History intravitreal peribulbar corticosteroid within 4 month prior randomization ocular condition DME . 8 . Any history anticipate need intravitreal antiVEGF within next 6 month ocular condition DME ( e.g . choroidal neovascularization , central retinal vein occlusion , PDR ) . 9 . History PRP within 4 month prior randomization anticipate need PRP 6 month follow randomization . 10 . Any history vitrectomy . 11 .
