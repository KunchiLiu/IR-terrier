	<brief_summary>Patients ask participate study colorectal cancer come back initial treatment . The investigator want improve treatment patient disease . In types cancer , possible improve treatment study gene mutation ( call biomarkers ) patient 's cancer `` match '' exist cancer therapy study drug target specific mutation . Colorectal cancer routinely test way . In study , investigator determine whether mutational test successfully do colorectal cancer often mutation detect exist drug ( drug development ) . The result use determine treat physician use information planning subsequent treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Analysis Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer ( MCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This short-term , prospective , feasibility study determine effectively investigator obtain biomarker analysis patient mCRC informed consent authorization obtain . The study do partnership Quintiles . Investigators collect data number clinically actionable biomarkers detect population number trial actionable marker detect population . Patients recurrent metastatic disease ( ie , first diagnosis metastatic disease follow resection , last radiation , last chemotherapy adjuvant setting ) primary specimen send biomarker analysis . Actionable marker genomic alteration FDA-approved companion diagnostic marker marker use trial enrollment metastatic colorectal cancer . Additional information regard FDA-approved companion diagnostic marker marker use trial enrollment indication mCRC also collect report . Biospecimens 25 patient early recurrence ( ≤ 12 month ) 25 patient late recurrence ( &gt; 12 month ) metastatic colorectal cancer appropriately collect , process , ship , test . The frequency sit mutation may hypothesis generate help identify patient high risk early recurrence aid identifying future treatment option select well treatment option poor prognostic group . REGISTRATION PROCEDURES Written documentation full , noncontingent IRB approval must file patient register . The registration process begin coordinator obtain sign informed con-sent . Patient demographic Clinical Trial Management System ( CTMS ) ; Web-based intranet system delivery trial information across USOR . A unique patient number ( UPN ) assign patient time . Entering patient CTMS signify patient register study . Once patient UPN number , coordinator go Patient Report select patient register . Located leave patient 's UPN letter `` Reg '' blue . The coordinator click blue `` Reg '' open patient 's information . Each page need complete yellow . The site answer question Inclusions , Exclusions , Prestudy Assessment page . Once question page answer , page turn green . An ID number study arm directly assign . SAMPLE PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES USOR study site supply tumor collection kit US Oncology Investigational Product Center ( IPC ) . Biospecimens date shipment within 4 week patient sign consent order enrol study . Tissue send central laboratory . Details ship provide Clinical Trials Information ( CTI ) provide separately USOR . Reference laboratory manual tissue preparation shipment instruction . SAMPLE ANALYSIS AND CONFIDENTIALITY It intention USOR Quintiles patient confidentiality maintain throughout procedure . USOR maintain rigorous standard confidentiality clinical study cod sample patient initial unique identifier ( UPN number/patient/study ID number ) study number . A patient screen upon sign ICF register CTMS . A patient consider enrol study standard care biospecimen available biomarker test shipment date within 4 week ICF signature . If standard care biospecimen unavailable , reason , within 4 week patient deem screen failure . BIOSPECIMEN ASSESSMENT High throughput sequence utilizing Life Technologies Ion Torrent platform similar alternative use . This methodology provide high-quality deep sequencing coverage ideally suit SNP detection mutational analysis . Point mutation identification analysis include target whole exome sequence tumor tissue cover several hundred human protein-coding exon . Results profile compile arrange accord relevancy clinical practice . All clinically actionable result provide back physician use identifier reference . SAMPLE TESTING FAILURES Samples submit analysis archive FFPE tissue . Ability perform AmpliSeq testing may limit base quality quantity sample available . Reasons test failure may due inability extract sufficient quality quantity DNA , inability create sequence library inability sample sequence . Should test failure occur , reason test failure record laboratory report back clinician . A patient opportunity , discussion study physician , dependent space study approval US Oncology Clinical Project Manager , allow re-submit one additional sample sequencing . If sample patient test failure 2 testing attempt , patient consider permanent test failure offer opportunity submit additional sample .</detailed_description>
