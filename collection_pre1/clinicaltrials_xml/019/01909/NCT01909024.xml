	<brief_title>Pelvic Embolisation Reduce Recurrent Varicose Veins - Recurrent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Varicose vein legs effect 20 40 % adult population UK . Approximately 100,000 operation perform per year varicose vein , although unknown many recurrent varicose vein . Failure treat varicose vein result 10 20 % patient deteriorate skin damage leg ulceration . Recurrence rate follow surgery vary report 70 % 10 year . Recurrence cause increase cost well increase patient 's healthcare requirement . The common cause recurrence report : - neovascularisation ( new vessel growth treatment ) - miss vein initial operation - perforator vein incompetence - de novo reflux due normal deterioration age Recent study show leg varicose vein cause pelvic venous reflux pelvic venous reflux cause recurrent varicose vein . Previous publish work unit show approximately 20 % woman present varicose vein legs child previously pelvic venous reflux duplex ultrasound . Such pelvic venous reflux contribute venous reflux leg , cause varicose vein . Furthermore , recent retrospective study unit suggest failure treat pelvic venous reflux treat leg varicose vein major cause recurrent varicose vein quarter woman . However , despite circumstantial evidence , evidence prove whether treatment pelvic venous reflux confers advantage patient term reduction future recurrence varicose vein , follow treatment . The treatment pelvic venous reflux currently coil embolisation vein x-ray control . This procedure clearly additional cost treat leg varicose vein alone . Therefore essential know whether treatment pelvic vein patient effect reduce future recurrence leg varicose vein . To examine benefit coil embolisation , female patient present recurrent leg varicose vein duplex proven contribution pelvic venous reflux randomise : 1. transjugular coil embolisation pelvic vein follow endovenous treatment leg recurrent varicose vein 2. endovenous treatment leg recurrent varicose vein alone The impact demographic factor , severity patient 's symptom ( Aberdeen questionnaire , CEAP VCCS score ) treatment history explore , addition type treatment receive . Patients follow six week , six month , one year , two year , three year , four year five year . Outcome measure include quality-of-life scoring ( CIVIQ ) , symptom severity measure ( Aberdeen questionnaire , CEAP VCCS score ) , patient satisfaction treatment clinical examination include clinical photograph duplex ultrasonography . The source recurrence classify use duplex ultrasonography .</detailed_description>
