	<brief_title>A Single Blind Study Cranial Electrical Stimulation Bipolar II Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I. ABSTRACT Cranial electrical stimulation ( CES ) non-invasive brain stimulation technology use small alternate current ( 1-2mA ) apply scalp affect brain function . The strength current similar use transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) ; difference case CES current alternating . CES FDA sanction treatment depression , anxiety insomnia since 1978 . CES never subject level regulatory review require new technology `` grandfather-ed '' base device predate current FDA regulation . As consequence , although hundred thousand people treat CES since development 1950 's , claim effectiveness largely anecdotal study hamper poor study design inadequate blinding . It important study well-controlled condition whether product , already widespread use , truly effective . This study examine efficacy CES treat depressive phase bipolar II disorder use rigorous control design . It first study use CES bipolar II disorder , first well control study antidepressant effect CES . Because CES already clinically available large number patient receive ( usually at-home , self treatment ) , important conduct randomize control trial rather merely replicate anecdotal report already exist literature . II . RESEARCH PLAN 1 . Background Rationale Regulatory Status CES CES currently FDA sanction may market treatment depression , anxiety insomnia . The Fisher-Wallace Cranial Stimulator ( model SBL500-B ) , become FDA sanction treatment anxiety , insomnia , depression 1990 ( 510K approval ) , use 0.5-2 mA ( milliampere ) alternate current three frequency ( 15Hz , 500 Hz , 15,000Hz ) device Liss Cranial Stimulator ( model SBL201-M ) , class III device , market since 1970 's treatment depression , anxiety insomnia . State Evidence Clinical Efficacy CES Although CES wide usage Europe United States 50 year ; well control study publish demonstrate efficacy . Its mechanism action unknown , though recent EEG study suggest effect brain oscillation ( Marshall et al. , 2006 . Schroeder et al. , 2001 ) . It appear benign , adverse event report literature except mild headache tingle electrode . The result 1992 meta-analysis Harvard School Public Health effectiveness CES conclude publish study CES hamper poor study design inadequate blinding . Using gold standard randomize controlled trial comparing CES sham double-blind manner , reject study former Soviet Union , uncontrolled . Searching human study English find 18 randomize control trial CES vs. sham , use variety CES device treat depression , anxiety , drug addiction , insomnia , headache pain . In analysis , analyze difference signal parameter treatment regimen . Purpose Present Study This single-blind , randomize , sham control study evaluate efficacy CES treat depressive phase patient bipolar II disorder . This first well control study role CES treat depression well first well control study role CES treat bipolar II disorder . We decide focus depression context bipolar II disorder need increase number effective treatment depressive phase bipolar II disorder , identify effective antidepressant promote switch mania . To end , ass risk hypomania mania use standardized scale . Of note , report case hypomania mania CES . Furthermore , want increase sample homogeneity limit study bipolar II patient , therefore exclude unipolar depressive disorder well bipolar I disorder . We recruit 20 bipolar II patient age 18-85 currently depressive phase illness ( mixed manic episode exclude ) . They randomly assign two group : placebo group active group , first two week study . The CES device use Fisher-Wallace Cranial Stimulator , use 1mA ( milliampere ) alternate current three frequency ( 5Hz , 500Hz , 15,000Hz ) . In study , patient receive CES 20 minute day , five day week . Patients able remain medication avoid risk subject withdraw medication , dosages must keep stable least two week prior enter study first month study . 2 . Recruitment Methods Patients likely meet inclusion/exclusion criterion recruit inpatient outpatient unit Beth Israel Medical Center via advertisement newspaper medium , physician referral site participate registry . Outpatients also screen Beth Israel Medical Center . Sample Description Patient recruitment reflect referral pattern outpatient clinic participating study . Given gender distribution prevalence bipolar II disorder , expect approximately half sample size female half male . It expect sample composition approximately 80 % Caucasian , 10 % African American , 5 % Hispanic , 5 % Asian ethnic group . 3 . Study Procedures Screening , Informed Consent Investigators screen patient base inclusion/exclusion criterion write informed consent , general medical psychiatric history , obtain . At enrollment , general medical history comprehensive physical neurological examination obtain , along screen laboratory analysis blood urine ( medical exclusion , drug screen , pregnancy screen appropriate ) . During baseline period ( informed consent ) prior treatment CES participant ' physical functioning , emotional well , life satisfaction , depression manic symptom assess . And documentation prior current mood disorder treatment ; documentation regularly-used , prescribed , over-the-counter medication supplements/botanicals ; neuropsychological battery ( describe ) obtain . Patients maintain dosage antidepressant medication begin two week prior enter study ( four week fluoxetine ) . During phase I ( two week ) phase II ( two week ) , patient ask keep medication dosages stable . In phase III study , medication dosage may adjust need . EEG record We record standard 64 channel EEG five minute first CES session five minute first CES session , well 8th week evaluate acute long term effect CES EEG . The electrode give 25 minute stabilize CES sensation threshold determine patient . Phase I , Randomization Phase Patients randomize either active CES control group 1:1 basis . Patients ask change medical state , medication caffeine alcohol intake , change sleep pattern prior begin study procedure visit . CES session perform 5 day week two week . Sham CES perform turn current patient experience tingle sensation scalp , decrease current threshold . This sham procedure describe literature . Criteria Treatment Continuation / Discontinuation ( Phase I ) : At end week , blind rater administer Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HRSD 17 item ) , Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) . At end Phase 1 , patient classify one three group : 1 . Stable remission : HRSD17 â‰¤ 7 end second week . These patient go Phase 3 enter naturalistic follow . 2 . Non-improving : Less 30 % decrease Hamilton Depression rating Scale ( HRSD ) baseline . These patient cross open-label CES Phase II . 3 . Improving : 30 % great decrease HRSD baseline . These patient also cross receive open label CES Phase II . Phase II , Open-Crossover Trial Phase II open label phase subject receive active CES two week . Phase III , Naturalistic follow 2-month naturalistic follow-up study participant include examine whether antidepressant effect CES persist beyond acute , active treatment phase . Patients maintain medication unless change type dosage medication clinically indicate . Patients rat weekly , 2 month ( 8 follow visit ) . The following assessment perform weekly follow-up visit : symptom depression global assessment functioning . Neuropsychological Testing do baseline , two week , four week eight week . Drop-out Criteria If patient CGI Global Improvement score 6 high ( i.e . `` Much Worse '' `` Very Much Worse '' compare baseline ) sustain across 2 assessment withdrawn study refer appropriate treatment . Additionally , patient develop psychotic symptom , develop acute suicidal intent and/or plan , need psychotropic medication change increase treat clinical worsening , require inpatient psychiatric admission , develop manic symptom ; withdrawn study refer appropriate treatment . Data Analysis An n 20 select base precedent set previous CES study 50 % reduction GAD symptom observe n 12 ( p =0.01 ) ( Bystritsky , Kerwin , &amp; Feusner , 2008 ) . We expect similar effect size study . 4 . Confidentiality Subjects mention name . Research record , like medical clinical record , keep confidential extent permit law . Any information obtain study available research staff , institutional personnel , federal New York State regulatory personnel . There legal advocacy organization authority state law access otherwise confidential research record , though re-disclose information without subject 's consent .
