	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see cell take line intestine behave laboratory exposure gluten substance act immune system . The cell line intestine person celiac disease different person without celiac disease . The study doctor would like see cell react come contact gluten substance act immune system prevent gluten related inflammation . Examples substance include steroid . The cell produce chemical response gluten . These chemical measure result compare : - celiac disease respond gluten-free diet ( refractory celiac disease ) - celiac disease control gluten-free diet - uncontrolled celiac disease ( either newly diagnose celiac disease gluten-free diet - gluten-sensitivity - disorder celiac disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study determine effect in-vitro introduction gluten inflammatory response primarily Interferon-Î³ cytokine , IL-15 , IL-18 IL-21 , culture obtain small intestinal mucosal biopsy sample subject underwent upper endoscopy . Secondary goal include compare inflammatory response immunosuppressant cytokine expose culture obtain small intestinal mucosal biopsy take RCD I subject intestinal mucosal biopsy take subject CeD control Gluten-Free Diet ( GFD ) , uncontrolled CeD , Gluten sensitivity Non-celiac Controls .</detailed_description>
