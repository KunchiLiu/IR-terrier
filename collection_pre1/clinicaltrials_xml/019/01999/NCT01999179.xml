	<brief_summary>The goal pilot study determine multicenter prospective cohort study cancer patient blood clot associate catheter feasible . Cancer patient catheter-related thrombosis treat one month anticoagulation evaluate post-thrombotic syndrome . Laboratory biomarkers evaluate predictor recurrent thrombosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-thrombotic Syndrome &amp; Predictors Recurrence Catheter-related Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants may refer screen Medical College Wisconsin ( MCW ) two possible mechanism : participant contact study staff information Clinical Trials Science Institute ( CTSI ) FACT website referral treat Hematologist Oncologist . At MCW , EPIC report generate identify people catheter relate thrombosis ( CRT ) . The treating provider would contact determine referral study appropriate . At University Minnesota ( UMN ) , referral treat Hematologist Oncologist . Subjects Ohio State University ( OSU ) refer treat Hematologist Oncologist . A report generate Epic use identify people CRT . The treating provider would contact determine referral study appropriate . Participants give printed information study verbal explanation use informational flyer . Verbal consent obtain screened participation contact study personnel . Screening complete BloodCenter Wisconsin ( BCW ) nurse coordinator . We aim consent enroll patient diagnosis catheter-related thrombosis prior catheter removal . Consent enrollment ( Visit 1 ) must occur prior discontinuation anticoagulation . Enrollment limit patient undergo anticoagulation enoxaparin due decrease recurrent thrombosis rate cancer patient treat low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) compare warfarin . Additionally , enoxaparin FDA approve LMWH treatment venous thrombosis . The study follow patient treat anticoagulation one month catheter removal . Prior discontinuation anticoagulation , patient contact via telephone review study protocol , ass bleeding , arrange Visit 2 follow 1-2 week . Visits 3 4 occur 3 6 month catheter removal , respectively . At visit 3 &amp; 4 , Medical history , cancer history , medication update . At visit , participant assess post-thrombotic syndrome use modify Villalta scale functional limitation use DASH questionnaire . At MCW , survey administer Translational Research Unit ( TRU ) staff physical examination complete BCW nurse coordinator . At UMN , survey administer CTSI staff physical examination complete UMN nurse coordinator . At OSU , survey administer research coordinator physical examination administer research nurse coordinator . Laboratory sample obtain MCW participant .</detailed_description>
