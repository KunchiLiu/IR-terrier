	<brief_summary>This study investigate gene responsible osteoarthritis . Individuals osteoarthritis know suspect caused gene mutation ( change ) may eligible study . Family member may also participate . Patients talk investigator explain study possible implication patient family answer question . The patient 's medical record review , personal family history take , physical examination do . Two procedure may do include blood sampling ( use DNA ( genetic ) study ) X-rays ( define osteoarthritis grade ) . If know mutation responsible osteoarthritis detect , participate family member interview telephone personal family health history blood sample drawn DNA testing , X-rays .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We investigate clinical manifestation molecular genetic defect human osteoarthritis . Families osteoarthritis know suspected genetic basis enrol . Individuals undergo clinical assessment genetic analysis purpose : 1 ) definition characterization phenotype , 2 ) determination natural history disorder , 3 ) genotype/phenotype correlation . Genetic linkage study may perform disorder genetic base yet know .</detailed_description>
