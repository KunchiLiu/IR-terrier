	<brief_title>Novel Biophotonics Methodology Colon Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Supported multiple gran NIH , develop perform preliminarily clinical study suite biophotonics technique promise unprecedented accuracy risk- stratification colonic neoplasia . The main goal study establish Bioengineering Research Partnership ( BRP ) objective refine provide comprehensive , definitive multi-center validation novel methodology colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening , thus provide quantum leap population screening . Colonoscopy potential reduce colorectal cancer ( CRC ) occurrence ~90 % identification interdiction precursor lesion , adenomatous polyp . However , CRC remain second lead cause cancer death United States anticipate 153,760 new case 2007 . The major reason exist CRC screen strategy adequate follow : According exist recommendation , every patient age 50 consider risk CRC candidate colonoscopic surveillance perform least every 10 year . However , screen entire eligible population ( &gt; 80 million Americans age 50 ) colonoscopy practically impossible variety reason include expense ( financial burden health care would ~ $ 100B year ) , patient reluctance , complication rate , insufficient number endoscopists . Indeed , currently less 20 % population undergo colonoscopy . The potential solution could risk-stratification . The lifetime incidence colon polyps ~20-30 % CRC ~6 % . Thus , instead perform colonoscopy entire population , target group risk develop neoplasia would allow focus finite endoscopic resource subject actually benefit invasive test . Current approach risk-stratification ( e.g . flexible sigmoidoscopy , fecal occult blood test ) plague unacceptably poor sensitivity positive predictive value . Thus , accurate approach urgently need triage patient colonoscopy . This test considerably less expensive colonoscopy ( colonoscopy cost ~ $ 1,000-2,000 ) , minimally invasive perform primary care physician . ( The strategy analogous Pap-smear screen cervical cancer : 50 year ago , cervical cancer use first major cause cancer death woman . The incidence reduce 70 % , number 1 killer woman number 13 , introduction Pap-smear initial screen test . Currently , initial screen test available case CRC . ) The propose program base novel spectroscopic technique develop multidisciplinary team , comprise biomedical electrical engineer , gastroenterologist , cancer biologist , biostatisticians . Two technique develop : low-coherence enhance backscattering ( LEBS ) spectroscopy four-dimensional elastic light scatter fingerprinting ( ELF ) . Many screen technique ( e.g. , flexible sigmoidoscopy ) exploit `` field effect '' colon carcinogenesis , proposition genetic/environmental milieu result neoplastic lesion one area colon detectable uninvolved ( i.e. , colonoscopically normal-appearing ) mucosa throughout colon . Several line evidence suggest nano/micro-architectural alteration among early pre-neoplastic marker colon carcinogenesis . Our group first explore concept field effect cancer screen mean optical examination colonoscopically histologically normal rectal tissue . A key capability ELF LEBS sense change microscopically normal tissue distance precancerous lesion . This open possibility identify patient harbor adenomas colon assessment histologically colonoscopically normal-appearing rectal mucosa without need colonoscopy . We complete successful animal human study show ELF LEBS marker superior performance exist marker field-effect CRC . We publish first demonstration mark ELF/LEBS aberration could detect far earlier currently know marker CRC include morphological ( e.g . aberrant crypt focus , adenoma ) cellular ( apoptosis , proliferation ) marker . In human study , demonstrate assessment ELF/LEBS signatures endoscopically normal rectal mucosa ( readily accessible colonic mucosa ) accurately identify patient harbor neoplasia elsewhere colon . Indeed , sensitivity rectal ELF/LEBS 100 % identify presence adenoma elsewhere colon , far exceed previously describe marker . This suggest ELF/EBS could exploit CRC screen mean simple inexpensive optical test without need either colonoscopy bowel preparation . Based preliminary data , hypothesize ELF/LEBS able identify subject harbor adenoma colon base optical alteration rectal mucosa assess without need colonoscopy bowel preparation .</detailed_description>
